			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / UK Company News: AFGH pays out Pounds 20m in dividends despite fall to Pounds 65m - Financial services operations help bolster profits for Botnar-controlled motor retailing group AUTOMOTIVE Financial Group Holdings, the UK motor retailing group controlled by Mr Octav Botnar which has lost its exclusive Nissan import and distribution franchise, suffered a 13 per cent fall in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 74.6m to Pounds 64.7m, in the year ended July 31 1991. But the group remained probably the most profitable car retailer in the UK, largely thanks to its financial services operations. Turnover declined by 11.9 per cent from Pounds 947.5m to Pounds 835.2m. No accounts have yet been filed for Nissan UK Holdings, the associate company. Despite the decline in profit AFGH paid total dividends of Pounds 20m for 1990/91 after paying no dividend for the previous year. Mr Michael Hunt, deputy chairman and assistant managing director who holds 10.63 per cent of the AFGH equity, received a dividend payment of Pounds 2.13m. Mr Hunt was committed for trial last month to the Old Bailey on charges of corporation tax fraud. The charges allege that the pre-tax profits of Nissan UK had been understated by a total of Pounds 150m over a period of 17 years. AFGH was formed in 1988 to comprise Nissan UK's car dealership and car finance operations. Mr Botnar separated these from the Nissan vehicle import and distribution businesses, which remained in Nissan UK Holdings. According to the AFGH annual report the 'ultimate parent undertaking' of the company is GF International Finance and Investments, incorporated in the Bahamas. This entity holds 71.52 per cent of the AFGH equity. The 'ultimate holding company' of Nissan UK Holdings is European Motor Vehicles Corporation, incorporated in Panama, which holds a stake of 71.52 per cent. Both the Bahamas and Panama entities are controlled by the same trustees of a settlement made by Mr Botnar in 1974. Mr Hunt said earlier this week in the High Court, that Mr Botnar, chairman and managing director of AFGH as well as of NUKH, retains 'the voting control' of the trust holdings. Mr Botnar is currently in Switzerland. He was abroad when a warrant was issued for his arrest by the Inland Revenue at the end of January, and he has not since returned to the UK. The Botnar-controlled companies are being drastically restructured in the wake of the dramatic move by Nissan Motor, the Japanese car maker, to terminate NUK's exclusive importer/distributor franchise for Nissan vehicles with effect from the end of 1991. AFGH is replacing NUKH as the most important part of the Botnar-controlled businesses in the UK, and is urgently seeking to find new franchises for its shrinking wholly-owned AFG dealer network - which previously sold only Nissan new vehicles - which it described 16 months ago as 'the largest automotive retailer in Europe.' In February 1991 AFG operated 160 new car dealerships. The AFG report says that this was reduced to 147 at July 31 1991 and to 132 since that date. AFG said recently that it was seeking to establish a refranchised network of about 90 dealerships, which would still make it one of the UK's biggest multi-franchise dealer groups. It has already taken on franchises from Peugeot, Citroen, Renault and Vauxhall, and Fiat Auto (UK) said last week that it expected to sign up a number of AFG dealerships soon. It is understood that Fiat may franchise some 18 AFG former Nissan sites. The AFG dealership subsidiary suffered a 13.4 per cent fall in turnover to Pounds 710m in 1990/91 from Pounds 820m a year earlier. Pre-tax profit on ordinary activities fell by 23.8 per cent from Pounds 13.98m to Pounds 10.65m, although after-tax retained profit was boosted to Pounds 20.2m by an extraordinary gain of Pounds 14.2m described as final dividends received from the winding up of 'dormant subsidiary undertakings'. According to AFGH's latest annual report the main contribution in the 12 months to July 31, 1991 came from its Automotive Financial Services subsidiary, which achieved a pre-tax profit of Pounds 26.9m, a fall of 6.6 per cent, on a turnover down from Pounds 122m to Pounds 107m. Mr Botnar has acted to reduce AFS's dependence on the banks through the formation of Auto Funding, a wholly-owned subsidiary. The AFGH report says that the financial services subsidiary had replaced 'a significant part of its banking facilities' with medium-term funding by securitising a large part of its hire-purchase receivables through a Pounds 220m issue of floating rate notes by Auto Funding. The AFGH report reveals that the loss of the Nissan franchise has forced the company largely to pull out of vehicle transporting. It has sold the main part of the business and assets of its Car Removal subsidiary, which had generated a pre-tax profit of Pounds 10.8m in 1990/91, down from Pounds 13.8m a year earlier. AFGH had an average workforce of 4,140 in 1990/91.</p>

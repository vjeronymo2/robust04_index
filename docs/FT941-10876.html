			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / Air attack threat against Serbs grows The threat of air strikes against Serb forces encircling Sarajevo moved closer to reality last night after the European Union called for an immediate lifting of the siege of the Bosnian capital. EU foreign ministers agreed that a decision could be taken at a meeting of the Nato council as early as tomorrow. Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, said Saturday's mortar attack on Sarajevo's outdoor market, in which 68 people died, marked a turning point. 'This brings us near a decision in one way or another to use force." Mr Alain Juppe, French foreign minister, said his government was losing patience. 'If there is no agreement in Nato, then France will not live with the status quo.' President Bill Clinton said the US would back air strikes if it were demonstrated beyond all doubt that the Serbs were responsible for the attack. Mr Clinton welcomed the request of Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, that it prepare for the use of air power to relieve the siege of Sarajevo and to protect peacekeeping and humanitarian operations. But Mr William Perry, the new US defence secretary, again said all options were under review. Air strikes might or might not help bring the parties to a settlement; if the latter, 'we ought to reject them categorically'. Mr Juppe noted that the US attitude was crucial, saying: 'The European Union cannot act alone. That is not enough.' The Nato session this week will consider a French plan to issue an ultimatum to the Serbian forces ringing Sarajevo to withdraw at least 30km and hand over all their heavy arms to UN troops, or face air strikes. Other options, however, are being reviewed based on UN commanders' assessment of the risks of Serb retaliation against the UN peacekeepers and the danger of a halt to humanitarian aid. A Nato decision in favour of force would require unanimity, overcoming earlier reservations expressed primarily by the UK and Canada. The UN Security Council has already passed resolutions which could enable air strikes to go ahead. However, Mr Andrei Kozyrev, Russian foreign minister, yesterday raised the prospect that Russia might block any further Security Council decision. The EU declaration yesterday called for 'the immediate lifting of the siege of Sarajevo, using all the means necessary including the use of air power'.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Chen Jinwu (7115 6855 2976)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 12 Apr (XINHUA) -- The National People's  Congress [NPC] Committee for Education, Science, Culture, and  Health and the China Patent Bureau met in Beijing today to mark  the 10th anniversary of the promulgation of the PRC Patent Law.    In a greeting letter sent to the meeting, Vice Premier Li  Lanqing represents the State Council and congratulates the  successes achieved since the promulgation of the law 10 years  ago. He says in the letter: The past decade was a period in  which the Patent Law was implemented along with the policy of  reform and opening up. During this decade, China's formerly  nonexistent patent system has developed rapidly from a small one  into a big one. After the law was amended in 1993 in  particular, the level of China's protection for patents has  basically reached that of the world. This law not only has  implemented the party's policy of respecting knowledge and  intellectuals and significantly aroused the zeal of scientists,  technicians, and the masses to engage in inventions, but also  has created a good legal environment and good legal conditions  for carrying out reforms, opening up to the outside world,  bringing in foreign capital, and launching joint ventures and  cooperative projects.    Li Lanqing continues: As economic and  scientific-technological competition has become increasingly  vigorous among countries today, protection for patents and  intellectual property rights has become increasingly important,  and governments of all countries are attaching great importance  to the protection of intellectual property rights. This issue  has become an important part of all countries in promoting  foreign economic relations, trade, and diplomacy. The Chinese  Government also attaches great importance to this issue, and the  "Decision on Strengthening the Protection for Intellectual  Property Rights" which the State Council will soon promulgate  will be instrumental for China to intensify its efforts in  protecting patents and intellectual property rights in China.  Thus, as our reforms continue to proceed, our opening up policy  continues to broaden, and our socialist market economic system  continues to improve, we must waste no time in intensifying our  efforts in protecting patents and intellectual property rights.  We must intensify our efforts in publicizing and enforcing the  Patent Law and in supervising its implementation, energetically  heighten the whole society's patent awareness, especially the  awareness of leading cadres of departments in charge of science,  technology, economic affairs, and trade. We must make sure  that issues relevant to patents and intellectual property rights  are placed high on our agendas.    Ren Jianxin, member of the CPC Central Committee Secretariat  and president of the Supreme People's Court, attended and  addressed the meeting. He said: In the last decade, not only  have we had a rather comprehensive Patent Law, which is up to  advanced international standards, as well as other supporting  regulations, but we have also made conspicuous and substantial  headway in areas governing patent application, patent  authorization, and patent protection. In a sense, the market  economy is an economy based on law. The Patent Law is an  important law for safeguarding the order of the market economy  and protecting fair competition. The trend of development over  the past several years shows that people have become  increasingly aware of the importance of using legal measures to  safeguard patent owners' legitimate rights and interests, to  stop patent infringements, and to prevent patent disputes; and  that tasks in protecting patents have become increasingly  arduous. Ren Jianxin urged people's courts and patent offices  at all levels to work even closer, train more personnel  specializing in patent protection, intensify efforts in handling  cases about patent infringement, strictly punish patent  violators, and fairly handle each and every case of patent  dispute so as to safeguard China's patent system and create a  new situation for patent protection.    Present at the meeting were Fei Xiaotong and Wu Jieping,  vice  chairmen of the NPC Standing Committee; comrades in charge of  the NPC Committee for Education, Science, Culture, and Health;  comrades in charge of the NPC Standing Committee's Law  Committee; comrades in charge of relevant departments and  committees of the State Council; and representatives from legal  circles and some enterprises in the capital.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 19 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa said Saturday [19 March] that Japan should take the  initiative in leading world disarmament in a videotaped message  to this year's alumni of the Defense Academy.    Hosokawa delivered the message by videotape since he cannot  attend the Defense Academy graduation ceremony on Sunday due to  his visit to China which started Saturday.    "We must lead disarmament...in the world," Hosokawa said.    It is unusual for a prime minister to stress disarmament in  a  message to graduates of the Defense Academy, defense sources  said.    Hosokawa, pointing out drastic changes in the international  situation following the end of the Cold War, also called for  fresh ideas regarding the nation's defense program.    It is the first time that a prime minister will not attend a  Defense Academy graduation since 1978, when then prime Minister  Takeo Fukuda failed to attend because of illness.</p>

			<p><P> April 1, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MCORP SUES U.S. OVER BANK SEIZURES  </P> <P> MCorp, the Texas bank holding company stripped of 20 of its 25 banks by federal  regulators, filed suit Friday against the government agencies on grounds that  10 to 14 of the banks seized were not insolvent.  </P> <P> The lawsuit, filed against the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and  the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., added another twist to the already  complicated case that may not be resolved for months and could cost the  government more than $2 billion.  </P> <P> "The company asserts that 10 to 14 of those banks were not in fact insolvent,"  MCorp said in its lawsuit, which seeks $70 million that MCorp said it lost when  the comptroller declared 20 MBanks insolvent Tuesday night.  </P> <P> MCorp, which was Texas' second-largest bank holding company until its collapse,  also filed a motion Friday in federal bankruptcy court in New York to convert  an involuntary Chapter 7 liquidation proceeding filed against it into a Chapter  11 petition.  </P> <P> The Chapter 7 action, which set in motion the latest MCorp developments, was  filed last week by three minor bondholders of the bank holding company.  </P></p>

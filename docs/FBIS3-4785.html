			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pak Yong-su, head of our side's delegation to the  contact of working-level delegates for the exchange of special  envoys of the North and South, today sent the following  telephone message to Song Yong-tae, the South side's senior  delegate:    Four months have passed since the contact of working-level  delegates for exchange of top-level special envoys  [choegowigubui tuksa] of the North and South, which had taken  place amid attention at home and abroad, was suspended.    As is well known, our side proposed an exchange of top-level  special envoys of the two sides last May out of an earnest  desire to reach a new turning point in North-South relations and  the resolution of the reunification issue, and made every effort  to implement this proposal at the earliest possible date. And,  finally, the two sides had three working-level contacts.  However, contrary to what we did, your side constantly pursued  nuclear war exercises and an international cooperation system,  which negate dialogue. Moreover, at a time the fourth contact  was imminent, your side made the violent remarks [pogon] that it  would be ready to take military countermeasures [kunsajok  taeungdo pulsahal] against the dialogue partner. In this way,  your side committed an unreasonable [ondangchimothan] act that  discontinued [tujol] the working-level talks.    Our side duly sounded an alarm [ungdanghan kyongjongul  ulligo] concerning this act by your side and repeatedly called  on your side to assume an attitude befitting dialogue [taehwaui  ipchang]. However, your side continued the Hwarang, Foal  Eagle-93, and other adventurous nuclear war exercises and built  an artificial barrier to our working-level contact.    If your side had sincerely dealt with [songuirul kajigo  taehada] the exchange of special envoys, our working-level  contact would have already been concluded [kyolsok] long ago,  special envoys would have visited Pyongyang and Seoul, and  pending issues acutely raised between the North and South would  have been resolved.    I think it is very regrettable that our working-level  contact  has so far not been on the right track [orun kwedoeso] and has  not been able to duly contribute to developing North-South  relations.    A North-South exchange of special envoys is an urgent task  [cholpakhan kwaje] that cannot be delayed even for a moment.    Therefore, I think it is fortunate that your side has  proposed resuming the working-level contact for the exchange of  special envoys.    Our side consents to [tongui] your side's proposal to resume  the working-level contact, acknowledging [injonghamyonso] that  your side assumed the position to resume the working-level  contact for the exchange of special envoys because your side  accepted our demand that your side discontinue all large-scale  nuclear war exercises against the dialogue partner and abandon  the international cooperation system concerning the nuclear  issue.    Therefore, we will go to your side's area in Panmunjom at  1000 on 3 March, Thursday, according to pertinent visit  procedures to hold the fourth working-level contact.</p>

			<p>910420 FT  20 APR 91 / Packaging goes green in Germany GERMANY yesterday passed a law to require packaging manufacturers and retailers to take back used bottles, cans, cartons and general packaging material, writes David Goodhart in Bonn. Mr Klaus Topfer, environment minister, said that the law, which yesterday was passed by the Bundesrat (upper house), would reduce Germany's household rubbish from 30m to 18m tonnes a year. Packaging manufacturers and retailers will have to mark with a green blob all products that can be returned. By 1995, this should apply to 80 per cent of packaging. The complex law will be introduced in stages between December 1 1991 and January 1 1993. From April 1 1992, purchasers will have the right to leave superfluous packaging at the point of sale. The Bundestag has blocked a bill designed to plug the loopholes in Germany's export controls which have allowed German manufacturers to play a large role in arming Third World dictators. The German postal service will have to provide only DM4bn (Pounds 1.3bn), rather than the planned DM8bn, up to 1994 to cover German unity costs.</p>

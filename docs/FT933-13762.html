			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Parsons shows off first aero-engine fan case for Rolls-Royce MR TREVOR MURCH, managing director of Parsons, the Newcastle upon Tyne turbine generator plant, yesterday showed off the company's first aero-engine fan case for Rolls-Royce Aerospace Group, Chris Tighe writes. The Pounds 250,000 case, produced for the Rolls-Royce BR211-535E4, is part of the company's move into new product areas. It is the first large Rolls-Royce component to be made by Northern Engineering Industries, Parsons' parent company, since NEI was taken over by Rolls-Royce four years ago. Parsons, part of Rolls-Royce Industrial Power Group, won the 10-year contract against stiff competition from within and outside the company. It has become one of two fan-case production sites within Rolls-Royce. The fan cases are made of titanium, aluminium and Kevlar, a synthetic fibre also used in bullet-proof vests. They are being produced in a former pipemaking building, refurbished at a cost of Pounds 6m. Production of the cases, which each need 800 worker hours, should reach one a fortnight this year and eventually output is expected to rise to two a week, generating annual turnover of Pounds 25m for Parsons. The BR211-535 is one of Rolls-Royce's most successful aero-engines, used by more than 80 per cent of Boeing 757 operators.</p>

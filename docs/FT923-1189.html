			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / US bank shuns Canary Wharf CHEMICAL BANK, the third-largest bank in the US, yesterday announced plans to move its European headquarters to Alban Gate in the City of London instead of Canary Wharf, the insolvent office project in London's Docklands. The decision is a further blow to the viability of Canary Wharf, the project developed by Olympia &amp; York, the Canadian company that has sought protection from its creditors. Canary Wharf has already been damaged earlier this month by the loss of American Express, another prominent tenant. The US bank's move greatly benefits Alban Gate, another conspicuous new building that has struggled to find tenants since its completion. The large, high-profile building in London Wall, designed by Terry Farrell, was developed by MEPC, Britain's second-biggest property company. Chemical Bank has withdrawn from Canary Wharf, where it agreed to let about 200,000 sq ft of space, because of the project's 'inability to perform' on incentives once it went into receivership. The lease was signed by Manufacturers Hanover Trust before it merged with Chemical Bank last year. Alban Gate will be used for the bank's trading-based and corporate finance businesses, currently housed in buildings in the Adelphi and the Strand. Chemical Bank's agreement to rent 164,000 sq ft is one of the largest office lettings in the City in recent years. The terms of the deal were confidential, although MEPC said that the 25-year lease had break clauses - which allow a tenant to move out - next August and at the end of the 5th and 15th years, subject to penalties. The insistence on a break clause of less that one year is highly unusual. MEPC believes it is unlikely to be exercised, since the bank will spend more than Pounds 20m in fitting out its premises, starting in December. MEPC said it hoped it could announce further agreements soon regarding the 173,000 sq ft of space that still remains to be let. The letting of half the vacant space in Alban Gate resulted in a sharp rise in MEPC's share price, which closed 13p up at 252p.</p>

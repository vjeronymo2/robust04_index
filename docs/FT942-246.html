			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Bonn pushes green car sales tax The German government is pushing the European Commission to back a proposal that would impose a sales tax on cars with heavy petrol consumption. Mr Klaus Topfer, the federal environment minister, said he believed the German proposal - which would levy tax on new cars that consume on average more than five litres of petrol per 100km - was the best way to control CO2 emissions from cars. He said the European Commission had not yet signalled it would pursue the proposal, although Germany hopes to have gained approval from the environment ministers of the other member states by the end of its presidency. Mr Topfer conceded that the proposal was unpopular in Germany where car makers make preponderently big-engined cars. On average, German cars consume 9-9.5 litres of petrol per 100km.</p>

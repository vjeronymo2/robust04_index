			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Ruzhdi Demiri: "The Darling of Europe </F> Destabilizes the Balkans"]    [Text] As international bodies step up their efforts to  solve the disputes that have arisen as a result of the bloody  wars among the Slavic peoples inhabiting the area of what was  Yugoslavia, and as optimism grows among the United Nations, the  EU, and NATO for an end to the war in Bosnia, certain Greek  political circles are becoming increasingly short-tempered.  Politically, this has been evident in rising political tension  in the region, an embargo and blockade against Greece's  neighbors, the toleration of acts of aggression on neighboring  territory such as the case of Peshkepi near Gjirokaster, and the  training of Kurdish terrorists for action on Turkish territory.  The last two represent acts of aggression against sovereign  states. Most recently, there have also been serious threats of  a possible Greek-Albanian war from Greek politicians on both the  governments and the opposition sides, as the Greek politician  Militiadis Evert said. The question arises of wily, despite the  Commitment of international bodies (of which Greece herself is a  member) to ending the war in the Balkans, every move by Greece  conflicts with this commitment. In fact, Greece has used all  its resources, through various forms of covert action, to  exacerbate regional tensions and to create the kind of relations  that could lead to open war with its own neighbors of Albania,  Macedonia, and Turkey.  <H5>  What Makes Greece So Tetchy? </H5>   Many commentators and analysts have seen the Greek  Government's decision to suspend dialogue with Albania and to  cancel the preparatory meeting for the talks between the two  Greek and Albanian foreign ministers as part of Greek  cooperation with the official policy of the Serbs, who aim to  distract attention from their brothers in Bosnia to the south of  the Balkans: Serbian policies are also, with Greek help,  destabilizing Macedonia, which is not developing regional  cooperation to the taste of Athens and Belgrade. Those who make  such claims may be quite right.    However, if one thinks of Greece's position in Western  institutions such as the MU and NATO and the status and  economic, political, and diplomatic benefits that flow to Greece  from membership in these institutions, it is difficulty to  believe that Greece does not have its own strategic interests,  not necessarily connected and coordinated with Serbian strategic  interests. The question arises of why Greece is so tetchy at a  time when a model for solving the question of Bosnia is being  formed, and, second, why Greece always expresses this tetchiness  whenever the issue of Kosova is broached, as now when there is  so much talk about the start of Albanian-Serbian talks and about  international bodies opening their files on Kosova?    It is interesting to note that after the statements by  Berisha and Rugova about talks with Belgrade in the presence of  an international third party, after Berisha's visit to Turkey  and Bulgaria and his recent meeting with Gligorov, Greece has  been intensifying its destructive tendencies toward her  northwestern neighbor. Greek policies and their interests are in  accordance with the current expansionist policies of Serbia.  However, the repeated creation of crises with Albania, in  cyclical form, by the Greek state and Greek political groups of  all colors leads one to suspect that Greece, in the strategic  sense, is not always in accordance with the policy of Belgrade.  The possibility of a start to solving the Kosova question  represents something still more serious for this anachronistic  Greek policy, and the possibility of even a formal rapprochement  between Serbia and the Albanians terrifies both members of the  government and the opposition in Greece.    In Serbia, despite the prevailing chaos, chauvinism, and war  fever, various statements have been issued here and there  calling for a revision of Serbian policies toward the Albanians,  such as the recent statement by Dr. Ratko Markovic, the compiler  of all Milosevic's constitutions in recent years, who spoke of a  possible reorientation of Serbia toward the Albanian factor  through economic cooperation on the Adriatic highway.  Intellectuals who were standard-bearers of the idea of Greater  Serbia, from Cosic to Ljubomir Simovic, are also calling for a  revision of megalomaniac Serbian policies. Simovic has come out  in favor of "a new, real, and objective definition of  ourselves," and for a realistic position for the Serbian nation  in the represent time of general national realignment.   <H5>    Fear of Solitude </H5>   There may be full justice on the side of those who think  that  Greece is frightened of a major Serbian turnaround after the  issue of Bosnia is solved, a turnaround that will result in  Serbia's return to cooperation and a Serbian demand for  integration on the East-West axis, an axis in which the new  Italian prime minister Berlusconi explicitly expresses ltaly's  interest as he received Macedonian Prime Minister Crvenkovski.  Greece appears to be worried at the possibility of being "left  by itself."    Thus, when the international community discourages Serbia is  its aggressive policies Greece attempts to embolden Serbian  aggression again, even more than the interests of the Serbs in  this direction demand, by tolerating terrorism and enforcing  blockades and embargoes against her neighbors. This is what the  Greek Government has done in its anti-Albanian decision to block  35 million ECU's from the EU, which were earmarked for Albania's  financial policy. This is what Greece has done in Evert's  threats of war, and so forth.    All these things mark out Greece as the most destabilizing  factor in the Balkans after Serbian militarism, and a factor  that could ignite the spark of a war that would be the overture  to a general Balkan conflagration. The question is how long the  international community will tolerate Athens' duplicity. In all  probability, a general opening up of everybody toward everybody  else in the Balkans will not suit Greek ruling circles for their  own internal reasons. It is well known that Greece in recent  decades received largescale economic aid from the West as a  bulwark against communism in the East. However, the Greek  ruling families like those of Papandreou, Venezilos, Mitsotakis,  and Kalderis have still not accounted for how all this aid was  spent and where it went, when the Greek economy is known not to  be in terribly good shape even today.    If there is any truth in these opinions, Greece, thanks to  its own government and ruling circles, might be left out in the  cold, with or without its current ally Serbia, when the Balkans  are redirected and integrated into the new world order and when  the exploitation of the East-West axis begins. The second  variant, more beneficial to the Greek people and state, would  involve Greece's integration in intra-Balkan cooperation, in an  area in which no visas would be required and there would be  unrestricted movement of goods, people, and ideas. However, for  the almost feudal Greek families who still hold sway, this would  mean accounting for the profligate expenditure of the  large-scale Western economic aid and for the political and  diplomatic errors that resulted in the loss of Cyprus and the  creation of hatred and tension between the Greek people and  their neighbors, which could have repercussions for decades to  come. Greece can no longer threaten the existence of any state  in the Balkans, thanks to the new balance of power that is in  greater equilibrium than at any time during the last seven or  eight decades. On the contrary, it can only weaken its own  position and hasten the decomposition from within of the Greek  state, in which Macedonians' Bulgarians, Vlachs, Albanians, and  trucks have now begun to demand the affirmation of their own  national characteristics.    Neither Macedonia with its flag of Philip of Macedon nor  Albania, "friend of the United States, Germany Turkey, and  Italy," pose a danger to the future of the Greek state, but only  Greek state policy itself, which, as we have seen, is  detrimental to the citizens of Greece itself, as far as the  borders with Greece's neighboring states are concerned, and with  its toleration of the racism of different political groups  toward neighboring peoples. Albania and the Albanians may for  the moment be prevented from receiving $30-40 million of  European aid, but it is the Greek people themselves who will  eventually pay the price for Greece's feudal government, as they  paid in Cyprus and elsewhere.</p>

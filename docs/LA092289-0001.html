			<p><P> September 22, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS: AS WORKING MOTHER, BHUTTO MISSES THE LITTLE THINGS  </P> <P> Pakistan Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto lauds her double life as working woman  and mother but admits it's tough when she misses special moments in her baby's  life because of affairs of state. For instance, there'll be the missed birthday  party this week for her 1-year-old son, Bilwal Zardari, born eight weeks before  his mother's triumph last November in Pakistan's first openly contested  elections in 11 years. "I'm missing my baby very much at the moment," Bhutto  said. "I have asked one of my relatives to arrange a little birthday party for  him in Karachi." The boy lives in Karachi with his father, businessman Asif  Zardari, while Bhutto spends most of her time on the move or in Sind House, a  sprawling mansion in Islamabad. She visits the two on weekends, making a  two-hour flight. "I think children have this natural love for a mother, because  I'm hardly ever with him, but when I see him his face lights up and he wants to  come to me," Bhutto said. As the world's first Muslim woman elected leader,  Bhutto sees her life as "a role model not only for Muslim women in Pakistan but  for women in the entire Muslim world . . . to demonstrate that a woman can  combine a home and a career."  </P> <P>  -- Former President Gerald R. Ford, whose wife, Betty, received treatment for  alcohol and drug addiction, believes President Bush's crusade against drugs  shouldn't ignore alcohol. "He (Bush) focused on cocaine but he did not broaden  it to include other mind-altering drugs," Ford told about 2,500 people in a  speech in Norfolk, Va. "Four times more deaths (in 1988) were related to  alcohol accidents than to drug accidents. The problem is broader than hard  drugs." He said rehabilitation centers are good, but they don't work miracles.  "Treatment centers -- you can't just throw them up, establish and have them be  successful overnight. I know something about that."  </P> <P>  -- Finders aren't necessarily keepers, says famed undersea explorer Jacques  Yves Cousteau, in explaining why he doesn't regret never having found a  gold-laden treasure ship like the one recently discovered off the coast of the  Carolinas. At an appearance at the National Press Club in Washington, the  captain of the research vessel Calypso pointed out that France requires its  citizens to report any such treasure to the government -- and can then force  the finder to assist in the salvage effort. Any compensation is left to the  government's discretion, he said. "So, knowing of those regulations, I would  really hate to find a treasure ship," he said. Besides, Cousteau added: "I'd  lose my crew, because they would all want a share." ANN CONNORS  </P></p>

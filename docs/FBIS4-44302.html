			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "SN, APA": "Protest Against Li Peng Visit"] </F>   [Text] Vienna -- A number of human rights organizations  protested on Friday [24 June] against the upcoming visit to  Austria by Chinese Government head Li Peng. In an appeal that  was signed by Amnesty International and Pax Christi, among  others, the Federal Government is asked to discuss with the  guest the serious human rights violations in China. Li Peng is  responsible for the Tienanmen massacre five years ago, the  appeal further notes. By hosting an official reception for Li  Peng, the government is proving "how little it cares for human  rights when it can expect profits."</p>

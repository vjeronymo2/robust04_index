			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Wall Street It would be wrong to ascribe the attack of nerves afflicting Wall Street to selling by Japanese investors anxious to offset losses in their domestic market. Japanese investment in US financial markets has always flowed most heavily into government securities, which have reacted much more stolidly than equities to this week's fall in the Nikkei. Granted, Japanese banks themselves may be under pressure as a result of problem lending to the property sector, and have been selling domestic bonds. But they have even fewer US equities to sell than other financial institutions. The connection between the Dow's gyrations and the fall in the Nikkei appears both more simple and less pernicious in its broader ramifications. Events in Japan have helped crystallise the view that US equities are overbought. Wall Street's historic multiple of 25 looks high when first quarter earnings are unlikely to show much benefit from recovery. The recovery itself now appears more anaemic than originally expected. It will not be helped if the Japanese economic slowdown spreads to the rest of South East Asia while European growth is kept at bay by the Bundesbank. Moreover, the Dow has been painting a more optimistic picture than broader indices such as the S&amp;P Composite. Its heavier weighting in fashionable stocks such as Ford, GM and Disney leaves it at about the same level as the start of the year. The S&amp;P, by contrast, which is skewed more heavily to last year's favourites such as drug and food companies, has fallen so far this year by some 6 per cent.</p>

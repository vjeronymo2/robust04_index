			<p>BFN     [Text] Speaker of the lower house of the Russian parliament  Ivan Rybkin and the deputy chairman of the Belarusian Supreme  Soviet Vyacheslav Kuznetsov spoke for closer unity between their  two countries in Moscow on Tuesday. Kuznetsov is convinced that  with time "we are going to advance from the Commonwealth of  Independent States to a union of independent states" setting up  a super-national body with coordinating and controlling powers.    In his opinion no matter who is going to be elected  Belarusian president on Thursday the parliament will firmly  pursue a policy of economic integration between independent  states.    At the present stage Ivan Rybkin finds it necessary to work  for unified, standardized legislation for CIS countries in order  to ease integration. He is convinced that the experience of  unified Europe, its common bodies and conforming legislation  should be used.    Rybkin said that last week the Duma supported the idea of a  parliamentary meeting of Russia, Belarus and Ukraine to discuss  the results of the 1991 agreement on the formation of the CIS.  "The evaluation of the situation should be realistic so that  our future steps can be adequate," Rybkin declared.    On July 5 the Duma committee for CIS affairs will hold  hearings on the same subject. Rybkin invited Belarusian  counterparts to attend.    In return the Belarusian side invited Russian MPs to take  part in festivities on the 50th anniversary of the liberation of  Belarus on July 3.</p>

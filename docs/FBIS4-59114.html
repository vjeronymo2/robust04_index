			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 10 May (MENA)--The Fifth Arab Energy  Conference has underscored the importance of proceeding with  studies and research into oil and energy in the Arab world and  developing new methods, particularly at the level of economic  institutions.    The conference made recommendations today, stressing the  need  to continue making efforts to cut the economic and social costs  incurred by the growing local consumption of oil. It  recommended the expansion of utilizing natural gas to increase  the portion of exported oil and its byproducts.    The conference that opened last Saturday called for  upgrading  exploration operations to increase Arab oil and natural gas  reserves and thus meet the expected growth in world demand for  oil and benefit from new technologies that have proved feasible  in the field of exploration, drilling, and production.    Organized by the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting  Countries, OAPEC, the Arab League, the Arab Fund for Economic  and Social Development, and the Arab Organization for Industrial  Development, the conference called for enhancing opportunities  for exchanging natural gas among Arab states. It also called  for launching a feasibility study on setting up a natural gas  network to link production sites with consuming areas and thus  achieve the optimal exploitation of that source.    The conference praised Arab efforts to use new and renewable  energies and emphasized the need for paying more attention to  the development of Arab capabilities in that field.    Held under the chairmanship of Egyptian Oil Minister Hamdi  al-Banbi and with the participation of Arab energy and oil  ministers, the conference called for going ahead with  electricity grid projects in both the Arab Mashreq and Maghreb.    The conference discussed 23 working papers on the oil  industry, electricity linkage, and the expansion in using new  and renewable energies. It called for expanding the exchange of  oil products among Arab states to diversify consuming markets  and for encouraging the private sector to set up companies to  market and distribute oil products in Arab markets.    The energy conference underlined the need to develop  petrochemical industries in Arab states and to expand the  manufacture of basic material needed for horizontal integration  to cope with the demand in Arab markets, increase exports to  world markets, and coordinate among Arab producers in production  and marketing.    The Fifth Arab Energy Conference emphasized the need for  Arab  and international capital to provide the necessary investments  to carry out the needed projects in the various fields of  energy. It called on Arab and international banks and financial  institutions to pay more attention to the preparation of  feasibility studies for energy-related projects. It also called  for providing the necessary investments to develop the oil  sector and for protecting investment-related decisions against  fluctuations in oil prices.    The conference stressed the need for Arab countries to  preserve the environment and take its protection into  consideration in launching development projects. It also urged  Arab countries to sensitize the public about protecting the  environment and curbing pollution.    The conference expressed concern regarding the negative  effects the proposed oil tax might have on oil. It viewed this  suggested tax as an act of discrimination against oil,  maintaining that the actual goal consuming countries seek to  achieve by imposing this tax is to increase their revenues at  the expense of the oil-producing developing countries. It also  expressed its fears that this tax might have a negative effect  on the world economy in general and oil-producing and exporting  countries' economies in particular.    The energy conference called for subsidizing Arab scientific  research centers to study and follow up on the problem of the  changing climate to ensure that the allegations made against  petroleum lack scientific proof and that oil is not the main  reason behind the increase of the carbon dioxide. It urged  research centers to publicize scientific facts, information, and  findings of studies into the problem of changing climates.    The conferees urged Arab and developing states to coordinate  their stance at international gatherings to explain the negative  impacts development programs in these countries might suffer if  discriminative measures are taken against petroleum when  discussing ways to curb the discharge of pollutant gas into the  atmosphere.    It stressed the need for developing a data base on sources  of  energy and the demand for it in the various economic sectors to  use in studies and research. It urged the organizations  concerned to supply the Arab Center for Energy Studies with the  necessary information and data for its studies.    In its recommendations, the energy conference called for  enhancing cooperation among OPEC and non-OPEC states and between  them and consuming countries to provide a suitable climate to  establish market stability and avoid price fluctuation.    The conference welcomed the invitation Syrian Oil Minister  Nadir al-Nabulsi made to hold the sixth energy conference in  Damascus in 1998.    Speaking on behalf of the organizing bodies, OAPEC Secretary  General Dr. 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Turki expressed appreciation for  Egypt, its people, president, and government for hosting the  conference. He thanked President Mubarak for helping the  conference and Dr. Hamdi al-Banbi for the efforts he made to  assist the organizing bodies in arranging it.</p>

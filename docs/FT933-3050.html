			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / IMF seals pact with Hungary THE board of the International Monetary Fund yesterday approved a new agreement with Hungary providing a SDR340m (Pounds 312m) standby loan facility and giving the go-ahead to further funding from international institutions. The IMF and Hungary suspended their previous agreement in the first half of last year when the budget deficit ran over target. The new accord restores Hungary's financial respectability. It triggers the release of a Dollars 100m (Pounds 65m) credit tranche from the World Bank and Japan's Eximbank, and a further Dollars 100m World Bank loan in support of Hungary's privatisation programme. Renewed borrowing from international institutions will enable Hungary to reduce slightly its reliance on international capital markets and manage more cheaply its gross foreign debt of Dollars 23bn, the highest per capita in eastern Europe. Yesterday's decision also clears the way for the World Bank delegation, at present in Budapest, to recommend backing for Hungary's efforts to recapitalise the largest state-owned banks after heavy loan losses. Under discussion in Budapest, and contingent on IMF approval of Hungary's macroeconomic policy, is a World Bank credit of about Dollars 200m for restructuring of the banks and a second programme to restructure large corporate debtors. Hungarian officials describe World Bank support as crucial in bringing the capital adequacy of the fragile banking sector up to 4 per cent of assets before the end of the year and closer to the Bank for International Settlements's recommendation of 8 per cent. The IMF credit agreement has its price for Budapest. It ties the conservative government to a programme of deficit reduction even as elections scheduled for next spring approach.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Andrey Kirillov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 7 Jun -- China does not support the  imposition of economic sanctions on the DPRK because this  measure "can only lead to an escalation of tensions on the  Korean peninsula." This was said today in an interview with the  ITAR-TASS correspondent by Sui Tsin, minister-counsellor at the  Chinese embassy in Moscow. He described reports in the Hong  Kong press about the possibility of China joining the sanctions  as untrustworthy.    China has limited influence on the DPRK, the diplomat added,  and it depends on the Koreans themselves whether North Korea  finally accepts the IAEA's demands concerning its nuclear  program.    The Chinese diplomat spoke in favor of continuing  negotiations and looking for compromises.</p>

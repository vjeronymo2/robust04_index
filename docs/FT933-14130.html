			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / International Bonds: Abbey National leads flock of issuers with Pounds 350m offer BORROWERS flocked to the international bond markets again in a wide range of currencies, astonishing many market participants with the deluge of new issues. Yesterday saw the launch of several large deals from corporate names including Abbey National, Royal Bank of Scotland, Rolls-Royce and Hoechst. Abbey National Treasury Services launched a Pounds 350m tranche of Eurosterling bonds, taking the total size of its existing 10-year issue up to Pounds 1bn. The move creates the largest corporate Eurosterling issue, matching the EIB's 10-year deal in size. Mr Jonathan Nicolls, director of corporate and capital markets at Abbey National, pointed out that while the UK bank obviously requires sterling funding, it is also keen to establish 'a genuine benchmark' in the Eurosterling market. He added: 'There has been a lot of demand for 10-year paper in last four weeks and I was keen to respond to that.' The demand stems from the fact that many foreign investors are interested in sterling paper because of the attractive yields compared with other European markets and the perception that UK interest rates should fall further. Abbey National swapped the deal into floating rate sterling to achieve funding at around Libor plus 20-25 basis points. The original Pounds 650m 10-year tranche launched in March was priced to yield 50 basis points over the gilt. Since then, the yield spread has fallen to about 36-37 basis points in the secondary market. Yesterday's tranche was priced to yield 40 basis points over the gilt, and the bonds rose on the back of the gilt market's rally, from 99.47 to 100.20-100.35, according to one of the lead managers. Royal Bank of Scotland also tapped the sterling sector, issuing a Pounds 200m perpetual sub-ordinated bond issue which qualifies as upper Tier Two capital. The bonds have a coupon of 9.5 per cent. However, after 25 years (and provided the bonds are not called) the coupon will be set at whichever is higher - either 9.5 per cent or 237.5 basis points above the five-year benchmark gilt yield. The coupon will be reset in this manner at five-yearly intervals. The deal was sold mainly to insurance companies and pension funds which have long-dated liabilities, as well as to some bond funds. The Eurodollar sector saw heavy issuance with a Dollars 500m, seven-year deal from Hoechst, the chemicals group, and a Dollars 300m, 10-year deal from Rolls-Royce. The Rolls-Royce issue was increased from Pounds 250m due to good demand.</p>

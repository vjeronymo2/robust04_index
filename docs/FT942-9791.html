			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / International Company News: Ras seeks funds as profits rise Riunione Adriatica Sicurta, the Italian insurance company, is to seek permission from its shareholders to raise funds for further expansion, particularly outside Italy. Ras, which is controlled by Allianz of Germany, yesterday announced a recovery in net profits for 1993, in spite of an increased tax burden. The company's net profit rose to L187bn (Dollars 110.5m) in 1993, compared with L95bn in 1992, when Ras had to write down the value of its government bond holdings. Net group profits increased to L355bn from L117bn, and group premiums rose to L8,465bn against L7,337bn. The company is proposing an increase in the dividend this year to L340 from L300 per ordinary share, and to L400 from L360 for savings share. Shareholders, meeting on June 29, will be asked to give the board a five-year mandate to increase the company's nominal share capital by up to L1,000bn. Mr Umberto Zanni, chairman, said the group was 'interested in overseas (expansion), particularly in those countries where Ras has a strong presence'. The company was well-placed to build on its holdings in Portugal, Spain, Switzerland and Austria, he explained. Ras said it would try to even out the disparity between the market performance of its savings and ordinary shares, by offering savings shareholders the right to convert one out of every 10 savings shares they hold into an ordinary share. If the plan is approved and acted on by all savings shareholders, Allianz's holding will be diluted to just over 50 per cent from 52.74 per cent of the ordinary shares. Mr Zanni said he would step down as chairman at the June shareholder meeting, although Allianz has asked him to remain as a director. He will be replaced by Mr Angelo Marchio, one of three managing directors of the group. The company pointed out that in 1992 it was forced to write down investments by L221bn, cut to L38bn in 1993. But the tax burden increased last year to L236bn from L49bn at parent company level. Mr Zanni said 1994 was likely to be a challenging year, particularly because of impending liberalisation of tariffs in compulsory motor insurance.</p>

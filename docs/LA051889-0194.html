			<p><P> May 18, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FIRST FAMILY TIES  </P> <P> By all accounts I was a precocious child, a characteristic my father  encouraged. He saw all of his children as a challenge, and he relished the  battle of wits we would wage. In that respect, Dad was certainly not a  traditional father. As early as I can remember, he treated me as an individual,  someone able to make my own decisions; of course, he would guide me along  masterfully until my decisions were pretty much in line with his own.  </P> <P> Mother (Jane Wyman) also encouraged me to be independent. One of her favorite  expressions was: "If I get hit by a Mack truck tomorrow, you'll have to take  care of yourself." At 4, I had the dubious distinction of being the only kid on  the block who knew what a Mack truck was.  </P> <P> With two rising stars in our little family, our lives naturally revolved around  the movies my parents were making. Both Mother and Dad were highly dedicated to  their craft, but there were clear differences in their approaches to work. Dad,  for example, was playing mostly personality parts, so he was able to put a lot  more of himself into his roles than he needed to absorb from them. Mother was  another story. She would immerse herself fully in whatever role it was she was  playing. In fact, she lived through every role to such an extent that it was  hard to recognize her when she came home. My recollections of her during this  time are of many different people.  </P> <P> The hours were also tough for both of them. It seems one of them was almost  always working on the weekend or too tired out from the busy week preceding it.  I think we (Michael and I) both measured the attention we received from our  parents, mostly because there wasn't all that much of it to go around. Oh, we  were well taken care of, don't misunderstand me, but as an adult I now realize  that there's a distinct difference between the care provided by a parent and  the care provided by a paid caretaker. We weren't neglected by any means, and  we knew even that the reason our parents weren't around was because they were  busy, not because they were ignoring us. It was simply one of the prices all of  us had to pay for their success.  </P> <P> So all of this meant I spent a lot of time with a woman named "Nanny" Banner .  . . who was hired by my parents to help take care of me. It was Nanny who  decided the time had come to see my mother on the screen. I had never seen any  of my parents' movies, and so Nanny packed me up one afternoon in 1945 to catch  the streetcar to Hollywood, stepping off at a movie theater featuring Mother's  current film, which if memory and family legend serve was "The Doughgirls,"  with Ann Sheridan, Eve Arden and Jack Carson.  </P> <P> According to Nanny, I had difficulty following the story line and not talking  back to the screen, but I was able to follow what was going on closely enough  so that when Jack Carson's character grabbed my mother's character in a tussle  of sorts, I ran down the center aisle and shrieked, "You can't do that to my  mommy!" I turned every head in the place, and Nanny and I were shushed back  into our seats.  </P> <P> Looking back, I think it must have been a strange way for a little girl to grow  up, having to comprehend seeing her parents on screen, adopting new  personalities and forming relationships at considerable remove from the  realities of her own day-to-day life. I'll never forget the time Alexis Smith,  Dad's beautiful co-star in "Stallion Road," visited our house. She and Dad were  having some publicity photos taken when I arrived home from school. I walked up  to my father and he started to introduce me, but something told me there wasn't  supposed to be another woman besides my mother in our house -- particularly one  so glamorous -- posing for pictures like these, interacting so warmly with my  father. When she offered her hand, I refused to shake it and after a mild  temper tantrum was finally sent to my room by my very embarrassed father.  </P> <P> Well, as you probably already know, most matches made in press agents' heaven  don't exactly have legs, to borrow an industry term.  </P> <P> Ronald Reagan and Jane Wyman separated in the summer of 1948. I was 7 years  old. Michael was 3. The news of their impending divorce took me completely by  surprise. I never heard any rumblings leading up to it, and very little was  ever discussed with me afterward. One day they were together, the next they  weren't; that's the way I saw it. All I could think was that things would never  be the same again. I was right.  </P> <P> Dad had the unhappy task of breaking the news to me. He took me out to dinner  that night, and it was just the two of us. On the drive over, my father and I  had another of our important car conversations. When I think of that moment, I  am still a little girl . . . I am still the same little girl who wanted to  scream, who wanted to curl right up and disappear, who wanted to cry out,  "Why?" or, "What about me?" or "What about what I want?" I have those same  questions still.  </P> <P> You see, in my family, certain things happen on the surface, and they get  discussed on that surface level, but we never quite get below the surface.  Mother is like that most of all, and I suppose I, too, am guilty of something  of the same thing, at least to a degree. Dad became that way, I think out of  respect for Mother's privacy, and to some extent he remains guarded about  certain things to this very day.  </P> <P> With an adult's perspective, I can now see telltale signs that things were  going sour for my parents. I think World War II, of all things, did a great  deal of the souring. For 4 years during the war, Dad put his career on hold and  worked making Army training films -- earning about $280 a month. Mother kept on  with her career at full pace, and I have to think that the family dynamic was  irrevocably changed as she became more and more the breadwinner. She seemed to  start making more than her share of family decisions.  </P> <P> When I was about 10, Dad started dating a small, slender actress with dark hair  and wide hazel eyes, named Nancy Davis. You could tell the two of them were  crazy about each other. They weren't lovey-dovey or anything like that, at  least not in front of us kids, but they had a natural, easy way of being with  each other that suggested they belonged together. Almost immediately, Nancy  became a fixture in the front seat of our famous car rides. Wherever we went,  the drives were filled with laughter and singing and good times.  </P> <P> Surprisingly -- to me anyway -- I didn't feel the jealousy I'd expected to feel  when I'd thought about Dad becoming involved with another woman. Nancy and I  got on right away.  </P> <P> Once I was able to deal with my parents getting divorced, I was able to  separate Mother and Dad in my head; at that point, whatever happened in  Mother's sphere and whatever happened in Dad's sphere were easy to  compartmentalize. I could try to deal with each development separately, and any  one development didn't necessarily have anything to do with any other.  </P> <P> Besides, I was delighted to have a baby sister. The only time I ever really  felt competitive toward Patti was when I was about 14 years old. I was visiting  Dad and Nancy. Patti must have been about 3. I remember she came running over  to Dad and plopped down in his lap and he said: "Hey, Shorty, how are you?"  Well, I died a thousand deaths, because, of course, that was the name he used  to call me. I was stung by the way she seemed to have stepped into the place in  Dad's life that had once belonged to me.  </P> <P> Years later, when I was living on my own in Washington and Michael had moved  back in with Dad and Nancy, I came to California for a short visit. I think it  was 1960, and Patti was about 7 or 8. When Michael moved in, the folks had just  gotten around to explaining to Patti that he was her brother, which pleased her  quite a bit.  </P> <P> And I said: "And do you know what that makes you and me?"  </P> <P> "No," Patti said, "what?"  </P> <P> "That makes you and me sisters."  </P> <P> Patti burst into tears and she ran from the room crying. I felt deflated. Dad  was quite embarrassed when he explained to me later that afternoon, "Well, we  just haven't gotten that far yet." And there was a reason they hadn't got that  far yet: I wasn't there. They hadn't had to go that far. They had just gotten  to Michael and only after it was decided he would move in with them. It seems  Patti was introduced to us siblings on a need-to-know basis, and until that  time there had been no need for her to know any such thing about me.  </P> <P> How could this little girl figure out where I fit into her scheme of things if  I was hardly around to make my presence felt? I may have carried her picture  around at school, but she didn't know that. After all, she had only seen me two  or three times in the previous 2 years. But still, as I listened to Dad's  explanation, while I understood it on one level, I started to feel out of place  all over again.  </P> <P> North America Syndicate, Inc.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 8 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier  and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen met with visiting former U.S.  Defense Secretary Harold Brown and his party here this afternoon.    They exchanged views on Sino-U.S. relations and other  international issues of common concern.    Qian said that the 20th century has seen two world wars and  many regional conflicts. China hopes to see a diversified and  equal world, with neither hot nor cold wars, in the coming  century.    Qian stressed that there is no conflict of fundamental  interests between China and the U.S., adding that the two  countries should constantly promote their ties in every field.    Brown said that his current China tour is aimed at seeing  old  acquaintances and making new friends as well as exchanging ideas  with Chinese scholars and officials on issues of common  interest, which will be helpful to resolving some problems in  the two countries' relations.    Brown, who is advisor to the U.S. Centre for Strategic and  International Studies (CSIS), is here as guest of the China  center for international studies.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Sergey Parkhomenko report in the "Lobbyism" column: "The </F> President Agrees to a 1.5-Fold Increase in Russia's Military  Budget"]    [Text] The defense lobby in the Russian parliament has  apparently used the pause granted it by the Russian Federation  Federal Assembly's spring holidays to the utmost. According to  a participant in yesterday's session of the State Duma Council,  over the two festive weeks a series of intensive consultations  took place between leaders of the republic's Defense Ministry  and the Duma Defense Committee on one hand, and representatives  of the Russian Federation Economy Ministry and Finance Ministry  on the other. Presidential national security adviser Yuriy  Baturin took part in the negotiations on behalf of the Russian  Federation administration. The subject of discussion was the  proposal by the above committee, submitted officially to  parliament as an amendment to the draft 1994 state budget  whereby the overall limit of spending on defense items should be  increased from 37 to 55 trillion rubles, i.e., almost one and a  half times.    State Duma Budget Committee head Mikhail Zadornov refused to  comment on these reports in detail, noting only that he "would  be very cautious about any such proposals." Some of his  colleagues, however, were more forthright: Journalists were  told that the committee coordinating the entire discussion of  the draft budget knows nothing about which sources the authors  of the grandiose amendment intend to tap to compensate for the  increase in state spending.    Nonetheless, the same sources indicate that President  Yeltsin  has been fairly well disposed toward the solicitation of the  defense lobby. The text of the Duma committee proposal was sent  to Viktor Chernomyrdin with an endorsement saying, "I deem it  reasonable to agree" [sshchitayu tselesoobraznym soglasitsya].    The presidential resolution, it should be noted, appears  extremely interesting owing to the peculiarities of Russian  syntax which has confronted interpreters with just another  puzzle of the "execute" and "pardon" kind [reference to phrase  "kaznit nelzya pomilovat" which, depending on where the comma is  placed, can read either "To be executed, cannot be pardoned" or  "Cannot be executed, must be pardoned"]. Its exact meaning  depends crucially on whether the original copy of the document  has a period or at least a comma before the word "to agree." If  so, then the lobbyists' success is almost a foregone conclusion.</p>

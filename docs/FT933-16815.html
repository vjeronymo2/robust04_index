			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / US reaffirms its role in SE Asia THE US will continue to provide stability in South-east Asia, Mr Clifton Wharton, US deputy secretary of state, has told regional leaders. Mr Wharton, in Manila on the last leg of a South-east Asian tour which has covered Cambodia and the six member-states of the Association of South-east Asian Nations (Asean) - Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore and the Philippines - said yesterday he perceived there was, prior to his visit, 'considerable concern' that the US was withdrawing from the region. But he stressed this was not the case. His message had been 'well received' in each country he had visited, Mr Wharton said. There had been 'strong appreciation' of his assurance that Washington planned to remain involved in the region, particularly from the standpoint of economic and security engagements. The US withdrew from its military bases in the Philippines in November last year following the non-renewal of a treaty covering the installations. American forces still maintain facilities in Japan and South Korea. Analysts have expressed fears that the US military's pullout could lead to an arms race among the countries in the region, or that a large economic power, such as China, could 'fill the vacuum' left by the Americans.</p>

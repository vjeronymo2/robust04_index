			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Eurotunnel pays TML to ensure funding EUROTUNNEL, the Channel tunnel company, said last night that it had made a Pounds 50m payment to Transmanche Link (TML), the consortium of construction companies building the Pounds 8bn project. Eurotunnel, which is pursuing arbitration over an independent disputes panel ruling that it should step up monthly progress payments to TML from Pounds 25m to Pounds 75m, said it had to make the payment in order to ensure that funding for the tunnel was continued beyond the end of May. Eurotunnel emphasised that the Pounds 50m payment was a necessary condition set down by the agent banks in return for their recommendation to the syndicate of leading lenders of a waiver permitting the project to be funded beyond May. The company said that the payment had been made without prejudice to Eurotunnel's rights under the construction contract. It intended to pursue arbitration over an increase in contractors' payments through the Industrial Chambers of Commerce in Brussels. Eurotunnel is continuing talks with its bankers.</p>

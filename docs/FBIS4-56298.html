			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Noel Lorthiois] </F>   [Text] Mexico City, Apr 26 (AFP) -- President Carlos  Salinas de Gortari's government is exhibiting weakness in its  four remaining months in power to such an extent that it is  systematically appointing "commissions" to solve problems that  are normally handled by corresponding ministries.    The three most important problems that have arisen in the  past four months in Mexico (the Chiapas insurrection, Luis  Donaldo Colosio's murder, public security, and a chain of  kidnapping cases) are being handled by special commissions  directly appointed by the Presidency.    This trend, according to analysts, bolsters the lack of  credibility by the corresponding offices, where corruption and  bureaucracy usually prevail, as several high-ranking government  officials have confessed. It also furthers the opposition's  charges of centralism and authoritarianism against the president  and his party, the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI),  which has been in power for the past 65 years.    The latest commission, the "Coordination for the Nation's  Public Security," was established yesterday, Monday. As an  irony of destiny or headstrong interventionism, the announcement  of its creation coincided with the announcement of a new  kidnapping: that of Angel Lozada Moreno, son of the owner of the  most important supermarket group, Gigante. This kidnapping  occurred 40 days after the kidnapping of banker Alfredo Harp  Helu, president of the group Ranamex-Accival.    The new organization, which is directed by Arsenio Farell,  who until now had been labor secretary, must "coordinate" the  public security-related activities of the secretariats of  government, justice, the Army, and the Department of the Federal  District (the capital), according to a communique from the  Presidency.    The president had already appointed a special commission  composed of "notable citizens" a few days ago. This commission  was charged with continuing the investigations into the  assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio, the late PRI presidential  candidate who was murdered on 23 March.    The creation of this commission took place following the  appointment of Miguel Montes as "special deputy prosecutor" to  oversee the investigations into the assassination. Montes is  still working on this duty. His appointment, which was made  five days after the assassination, caused surprise because the  investigations should normally have been handled by the nation's  attorney general, Diego Valadez. The Chamber of Deputies, where  the PRI holds a broad majority, also decided that day to appoint  a parliamentary investigatory commission, perhaps to avoid  criticism of doing less than others.    Many shadows surround the investigations and the way they  have been conducted while the authorities, the special deputy  prosecutor, and the investigatory commissions maintain absolute  silence.    The creation of special commissions began in January with  the  appointment of Manuel Camacho Solis as "special commissioner" to  oversee the establishment of a dialogue with the Zapatist  National Liberation Army, the guerrilla movement that emerged at  the beginning of the year in Chiapas.    The matter could have been handled by the government  secretary, but he, Patrocinio Gonzalez Garrido, who had been  criticized due to his performance when he was Chiapas governor,  had to be quickly replaced. According to institutional systems,  the matter should have been handled by the current government  secretary, Jorge Carpizo.    We could finally mention the National Commission for the  Integral Development of the Indian People, which was created  shortly after the Chiapas insurrection. Four months after the  creation of this commission, Beatriz Paredes, who headed it, was  appointed, on 18 April, deputy government secretary in charge of  public development and no one replaced her at the head of the  commission about whose future the authorities have said nothing.</p>

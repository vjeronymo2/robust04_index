			<p><P> July 17, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PACTEL TO HALVE MEDICAL PLANS FOR EMPLOYEES  </P> <P> Pacific Telesis Group said Monday that it will eliminate half of the health  maintenance organizations it offers workers and retirees of the parent company  and its Pacific Bell Telephone subsidiary in an effort to reduce health-care  costs and provide more cost-effective health benefits.  </P> <P> The move, effective on Jan. 1, follows the utility's earlier announcement that  it would revamp its overall health-care plan in response to settlement of the  August, 1989, strike by the Communications Workers of America.  </P> <P> The union struck Pac Bell for two weeks over proposed changes in Pac Bell's  health-care plan. The new plan, which was also part of negotiations with other  Pac Bell unions, affects some 100,000 employees of the parent company, Pac  Bell, Nevada Bell and the Pacific Bell Directory unit.  </P> <P> The announcement also follows predictions from health-care consultants that  more and more large corporations would drastically reduce the number of HMO  alternatives they offer employees. The result, they say, could be the  elimination of some weak HMOs from the marketplace as companies apply more  stringent tests in the selection process.  </P> <P> Reducing the number of HMOs next year will allow the company "to better manage  and control our HMO costs by building strong business partnerships with a few  plans," said Jim Beck, Pac Bell director of health plans.  </P> <P> Workers may choose to participate in one of five HMOs -- instead of the current  10 -- or the new Pacific Bell Health Care Network, which will operate like an  HMO.  </P></p>

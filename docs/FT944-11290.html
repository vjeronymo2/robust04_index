			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Vultures ready to pick the weakest - A likely shake-out in the life insurance industry Vultures seem to be hovering over some UK life insurance companies. Across the sector, companies have had to cope with the rising costs of meeting increasingly tough regulatory standards, and have had to accept that selling opportunities are being forgone as sales forces spend more time being trained. These difficulties come against a background of widespread public concern about the possible mis-selling of personal pensions to people opting or transferring out of occupational schemes, which has depressed new business. A further consequence is that many independent financial advisers are likely to go out of business in the process of compensating the victims of poor pensions advice. This would intensify competition among life insurers to win business through the remaining independent advisers. Even before the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief regulator, focused attention on the cost of pensions compensation - which one estimate puts at Pounds 2bn - a forecast by actuaries Bacon &amp; Woodrow suggested that within a decade about 40 life companies would be struggling still to sell life insurance. Just two days after that forecast was published in late September, the life sector received a further reminder of the fragility of some companies. Sir Mark Weinberg, a leading figure in the UK life industry, announced plans for a new company with Pounds 100m capital to acquire life companies, close them to new business and manage their existing funds. Though Sir Mark dislikes the term, the venture is a version of what many in the life sector call 'vulture life'. It depends on picking up life companies which can no longer survive on their own and living off the business they have already acquired. The plan is a joint venture with New York Life Worldwide, whose subsidiary, Windsor Life, has already been in this line of business in a smaller way. All this has sharpened interest in which companies are the weakest and what the options available to them are. Mr John Wybrew, chairman of Windsor Life and chief executive of the new company, sees small and medium-sized mutual insurers as most vulnerable. They are owned by their policyholders, and cannot raise money through shareholders. They could thus suffer from lack of access to capital. On the other hand, the lack of any institutional shareholder reduces the prospect that a company's management would find itself forced to address its future if it did not want to do so. The other category widely identified as potentially vulnerable is small and medium-sized subsidiaries of overseas parent companies. Bacon &amp; Woodrow's report showed that the 37 life companies of this type had the highest average expense ratio in the sector, putting them in a weak position if competition took the form of a price war. Two other characteristics could also be important for this type of company. First, they could be particularly hard hit by the need to compensate victims of poor pensions advice. As 'unit-linked' companies, the structure of the policies they sell does not give them the discretion available to companies selling 'with profits' policies, where significant amounts of money in free reserves have not been strictly allocated to policyholders. Second, the decision would ultimately be not for the management of the life company but for the parent group, which could be approached directly by a predator and might decide it was time to leave an increasingly competitive UK market. For companies deciding that they cannot survive alone, there seems broadly two options: sale to a 'vulture fund' or takeover by a large insurer which would want to keep them as part of a continuing business. The expectation is that many managements in that position would prefer to be part of a going concern. Sir Mark, however, identifies a third option - splitting a life company and selling different elements to different buyers. 'There is no reason why a company shouldn't be unbundled into a sales operation and a closed fund,' he says. It offers a chance for the company buying a sales force to improve its distribution capacity quickly, without the costs of recruiting and training. As an example of demand for direct sales forces alone, he points to Allied Dunbar's payment in March for the right to recruit the 600-plus sales force available when Hill Samuel closed to new life and pensions business. This approach depends on the sales operations being seen as a separate source of value rather than of expense. Mr Michael Wadsworth, a partner at consulting actuaries Watsons, is not convinced. 'Usually in those circumstances, the distribution is not worth very much, either because the sales operation is not very good quality, or because - in the case of a company selling through independent advisers - it merely replicates the potential purchaser's existing ability to sell,' he says. The gloom over the sector need not translate into a cull of life companies tomorrow: even the smallest have millions of pounds in funds and do not need to decide immediately that they cannot survive. The longer-term trends mean, however, that the vultures will continue to circle.</p>

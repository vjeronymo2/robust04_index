Over the elapsed time, this mechanism has been fine-tuned  and now is working almost without a glitch. The city authorities  have managed over an extremely short period of time to put  together a legislative base--the basis for the conduct of  privatization; to set up a powerful computer network linked to  the main computer in the city agency for housing privatization,  which gave the city the necessary information on the process of  transferring housing to private hands. The agency, created at  the end of November of last year, practically began its  operation at the time that housing privatization got its  start--on 6 December.    According to the agency's data, which were provided to us by  its chief, Yevgeniy Tokarchuk, as of 5 March 4,430 apartments  had been privatized in Kazan, which comprises 3.5 percent of all  city housing subject to privatization by law. In Kazan's  Baumanskiy Rayon, 273 persons received contracts transferring  housing to private ownership; in Sovetskiy Rayon--1,083,  Vakhitovskiy--572, Privolzhskiy--956, Moskovskiy--934,  Leninskiy--1,220, and Kirovskiy--368.    More than 9,500 applications for housing privatization  already have been submitted. Now in the housing maintenance  organizations, waiting for its owners who apparently had not  expected to get all [lines missing].    Instead of the period of one month envisaged by the law for  a  contract to be issued after the application is submitted, in  Baumanskiy, Sovetskiy, and Moskovskiy Rayons the processing  period for housing privatization documents has been reduced to  10 or at most 16 days. In Leninskiy and Privolzhskiy Rayons,  however, which are experiencing some computer problems,  contracts are issued a month after the application is submitted.    Time begets new problems: refusal to privatize after the  contract has already been processed. People had submitted  applications to housing maintenance offices, and then changed  their mind. Ye. Tokarchuk's comment on this situation was that  they explain their change of mind by open threats of extortion.  For instance, quarrels have already begun in some families, and  canceling the contract in this situation is the best way out of  the situation. Quite possibly, some of soon to be property  owners have run into those who already own it and have realized  that it is better at this point to keep living in a state-owned  apartment.    The pace of housing privatization in the city has  stabilized.  Looking at the December data, at the time more than 1,000  applications a week were coming in; in January, the number  dropped to 800, and in February--600 a week. According to the  latest data from the agency, now about 650-700 applications are  coming in every week. Ye. Tokarchuk noted that city residents  are not well informed on the terms, rules, and advantages of  housing privatization. People ask the most elementary questions.  The most often asked is whether they may have to pay more for a  privatized apartment.    "We have to explain patiently that payments for a privatized  apartment remain the same," Ye. Tokarchuk tells us, "while the  property tax amounts to only 0.1 percent of the book value of  the cost of the housing as of 1 January 1994; that the tax is  paid once a year in November-December, and inflation will make  the amount of the tax rather modest. Besides, some categories of  citizens are exempt from property taxes altogether."    Many questions are asked regarding residence permits as  applied to privatized housing. People ask about the procedures  of willing apartments as inheritance, giving them as a gift, and  buying and selling.    Generally, however, the city agency's main tasks are not in  answering people's questions. The agency represents the main  link in the chain of housing privatization departments under  heads of rayon administrations; it has been set up under the  head of the Kazan administration. [Line missing] of  privatization is computerized. One of the agency's main  functions is to monitor compliance with the law. The main  computer located at the agency checks whether the housing unit  indicated in the application is subject to privatization. As is  known, it is against the law to take possession of decrepit  housing or housing assigned as part of one's official position.  There are restrictions on apartment privatization in buildings  that represent historic and architectural landmarks. The  dispassionate machine also picks up facts of multiple residence  permits and repeat privatization by the same person.    The main computer also assigns a registration number to all  contracts transferring housing into private ownership. Each  rayon has its own code, but the city keeps its own integrated  registration. Therefore, the registration number consists of a  code and a sequential number.    In addition, the agency monitors the work schedule and  operations of housing maintenance offices and rayon housing  privatization departments and conducts planned weekly audits.    As to the concrete results of the city agency's work, over  these three months three incidents of multiple residence permits  have been detected, and several precedents of attempts to  privatize housing that by law is not subject to privatization.  The privatization applications of all these persons were  rejected.    According to fresh statistical data received in the agency  through the computer network, local soviets' housing comprises  65.9 percent of all privatized housing, and 34.1  percent--housing previously owned by organizations. The city  authorities had quite a few unpleasant moments dealing with  reluctance and open sabotage on the part of enterprises that did  not want to relinquish their housing to ownership of the people  living in it. Now the situation has improved perceptibly, and  enterprises that attempt at all costs to make their housing a  part of their charter capital are few and far between. They have  managed, however, to slow down privatization of enterprise-owned  housing, which accounts for a lower share of such housing as  compared to one owned by local soviets.    The main computer has a full picture of the attributes of  the  privatized housing. One-room apartments account for the greatest  share of privatized housing (44.3 percent), followed closely by  two-room apartments (37.6 percent), then three-room  apartments--14.9 percent, and rooms in communal apartments--3.2  percent.    [Lines missing] cases become single or elderly people. Our  state has deprived our elderly of the opportunity of leaving  inheritance in a deposit book. Their life savings--3,000-5,000  rubles--have lost their value completely. Now, however, they  have the opportunity to leave a million-ruble inheritance--an  apartment-- and the elderly want to take advantage of this right.    According to Ye. Tokarchuk, the results of analysis  conducted  by the service show that 3.5 percent of housing has now been  privatized in Kazan; by the end of the year it will reach  approximately 20 percent. In Russia during the first year also  10-12 percent of housing had been transferred to private  ownership; now it is between 30 and 50 percent, depending on the  region.    So far, housing privatization is proceeding here in the same  way as in Russia, and only a few of us have had the chance to  appreciate fully the right to own housing. However, a market in  apartments is already emerging in the city, where enormous  prices per square meter will lift the mood of owners of Kazan  real estate.</p>

			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / MacGregor fails to avert rebellion threat THE GOVERNMENT was last night still facing a possible revolt next week over British Rail privatisation - in spite of attempts by Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, to calm fears of potential rebel Tory MPs. Sir Keith Speed, Tory MP for Ashford who is leading the protests, said after an hour-long meeting with Mr MacGregor that he may still vote against the government when the Railways bill is debated on Monday and Tuesday. At least eight Tory MPs have signed amendments to the bill that would allow BR itself to compete for passenger service franchises. The MPs also want legal guarantees to ensure that concessionary fare schemes for pensioners and young people and London Travelcards continue under privatisation. In theory, nine rebels would be enough to overturn the government's majority of 18, if all opposition parties attend in full strength and assuming the rebels' amendments are selected by the Speaker. However, there were signs last night that Mr MacGregor may have offered sufficient assurances - particularly on concessionary travel cards - to bring some rebels into line. Government business managers will increase pressure over the weekend on others. Sir Keith said the rebels would consider their position. As a last resort the government could probably rely on several of Northern Ireland's Unionist MPs being absent. Mr MacGregor hinted that he would try to head off the rebellion by making clear that concessionary fare schemes and the London Travelcard were likely to remain commercially attractive after privatisation. He remained strongly opposed, however, to any move towards allowing BR to bid for franchises - which he believes would undermine the main objective of the bill, the transfer of the operation of rail services from the public to private sector. Instead BR managers are being offered financial incentives to launch management buy-outs.</p>

			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / Careers 'high priority' for women GETTING on in their job is becoming more of a priority for women under 35 than having children, the National Council of Women of Great Britain said yesterday. The survey by the council, an umbrella organisation for more than 100 groups, shows that only a small minority of women aged between 16 and 44 thought a women needed a child to feel fulfilled. When asked what they would like to spend more time on, families came third on every woman's list. Only a fifth wanted to devote more hours to their home life. Time for hobbies and educational opportunities scored twice as highly. Women also believed that society undervalued the work they did in the home and with their families.

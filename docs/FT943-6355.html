			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / Dispute costs IoD members Pounds 180m The 11-week rail strike has cost members of the Institute of Directors more than Pounds 180m according to the institute, which today renews its call for industrial disputes in essential services to be settled by binding arbitration. The IoD said a survey of its 33,000 members showed that three out of 10 directors said their businesses had suffered financially because of the strikes. In the south nearly a third of directors said the impact on business had been serious. Companies across the country estimate that they have lost between Pounds 1,000 and Pounds 10,000 a week because of the disruption to rail services. The survey shows that a fifth of businesses which normally distribute by rail have decided that they will switch permanently to road transport. The IoD, which in the past has called for the banning of all public-sector strikes that breach procedure agreements, said disputes should be eliminated with the introduction of legally binding arbitration. Mrs Ann Robinson, head of the IoD policy unit, said the government should ensure that 'suppliers of essential services maintain those services at all times'.</p>

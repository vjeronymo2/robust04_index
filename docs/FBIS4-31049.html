			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vlado Trisic] </F>   [Text] The information collected today by the Serbian  intelligence circles in Bijeljina are the best proof of the fact  that the joint state of the Muslims and Croats had been created  with the clear aim of becoming a coalition bloc for countering  the Serbs. According to these reliable military sources, there  are nearly 50,000 soldiers in Tuzla at the moment, with new  forces coming every day from the former Croat-Muslim front and  from abroad.    It is known for sure, one is told in Bijeljina today, that  Zagreb airport and the Split port are the main points for  disembarking arms, military equipment, and volunteers from  Muslim countries who are then, it is claimed, immediately sent  to Tuzla, regardless of the complaints by Croats from some  Croatian cantons.    According to what is said in the east Bosnian corps press  center today, artillery pieces and ammunition has been  disembarked from three ships in the Split port last week and  seven NATO cargo aircraft landed on Zagreb airport. The  disembarkation was closely followed by the regular Army of the  Republic of Croatia and representatives of the Army of  Bosnia-Herzegovina. Convoys that included UNPROFOR vehicles  immediately set off toward Tuzla.    Apart from this sea port and airport, the Tuzla Dubrave  airport has also been used for deliveries of military equipment  recently, despite constant protests by the Serbian side that the  airport should exclusively be used for humanitarian purposes and  with Serbian representatives being present. However, all the  demands made so far have simply been ignored by the  international forces who are often using this facility for  provocative purposes.    According to the announcement the east Bosnian corps of the  army of the republic of Srpska issued today, all this that has  recently been happening in the Tuzla region shows that peace is  still far away in these territories and that the situation on  the Majevica and Brcko battlefields has been nearing the boiling  point.</p>

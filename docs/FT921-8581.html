			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / International Company News: Krupp shares to be traded on market for first time SHARES in Fried. Krupp, the German steel and engineering group, are to be traded on the open stock market this summer for the first time in the company's 181-year history. The flotation follows a decision by the group's supervisory board on Saturday to convert the group - of which 75 per cent is held by the Alfried Krupp foundation and 25 per cent by the Iranian government - into an aktiengesellschaft, or public limited company. Fried. Krupp AG will serve as the umbrella organisation controlling the combined operations of the existing Krupp businesses and those of Hoesch, soon to be merged with Krupp. Some of the shares are expected to be used in swap deals to pay for the outstanding 49 per cent of Hoesch stock still not in Krupp's hands. A majority, however, will remain under the control of the Krupp foundation - established in July 1967 - making the group virtually immune to takeover challenges. The Krupp plan followed a decision by the Hoesch supervisory board last Friday not to obstruct the merger, which is expected to produce cost savings of DM300m (Dollars 184.2m) a year for the next five years, and a DM460m annual 'positive contribution to results' from 1996 onwards. Krupp, founded in 1811 as a 'manufacturer of English cast steel', first became a stock corporation in 1903. However, Ms Bertha Krupp, the founder's granddaughter, owned all but four shares. The group was converted back to sole family ownership during the second world war, when the group was known abroad as Hitler's armourer. Once known only for its steel and weapons manufacture, it has since become a diversified business with more than 200 subsidiaries and annual sales last year of DM15.6bn. At present, steel accounts for 50 per cent of turnover, with engineering and plant-making contributing DM5.5bn, trading operations a further DM2bn and electronics some DM700m. The merger with Hoesch will make the group the second biggest German steelmaker after Thyssen, and also offer synergies in motor components and other engineering sectors. Krupp's switch to Plc status is likely to be completed in March and first trading in the shares is expected in August.</p>

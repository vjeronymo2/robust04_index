			<p><P> July 4, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: HERE'S A SITUATION IN WHICH HAVING LESS IS AN ADVANTAGE  </P> <P> Pete Rose has eight letters in his two names. Harmon Killebrew has 15. All else  being equal, doesn't Rose have almost twice the earning power of Killebrew when  they sign autographs at the these baseball card shows?  </P> <P> Doesn't seem fair, does it?  </P> <P> Hall of Fame slugger Mel Ott once said, "Every time I sign a ball, and there  must have been thousands, I thank my luck I wasn't born Coveleskie or  Wambsganss or Peckinpaugh."  </P> <P> The trick, of course, is to change your name. Think of poor Connie Mack if he  had had to sign his real name. He came into the world as Cornelius  McGillicuddy.  </P> <P> Going to the extreme, what if you had to sign your full name? Former pitcher  Cal McLish, who is part Indian, was Christened Calvin Coolidge Julius Caesar  Tuskahoma McLish.  </P> <P> His friends call him Buster.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Add autographs: The St. Petersburg Times did a poll in which readers were asked  whose autograph they coveted most among sports legends.  </P> <P> Jack Nicklaus was first, closely followed by Don Shula. Then came Red Grange,  Muhammad Ali and Chris Evert. Tied for sixth were Rose and Wayne Gretzky.  </P> <P> Of the first five, all live in Florida except Ali.  </P> <P> </P> <P> More autographs: Said Casey Stengel: "About this autograph business. Once,  someone in Washington sent a picture up to me and I wrote, 'Do good in school.'  I look up, this guy is 78 years old."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Trivia time: Who won the men's singles gold medal in tennis in the Seoul  Olympics?  </P> <P> </P> <P> Now-it-can-be-told Dept.: After the Golden State Warriors signed 6-5 guard  Sharunas Marchulenis, high scorer on the Soviet Union's championship team in  the Olympics, Coach Don Nelson said: "When negotiations first started, I began  to learn Russian. Then I learned he doesn't speak Russian, he speaks  Lithuanian."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Add Marchulenis: Scout Scotty Stirling of the Sacramento Kings, who once worked  for the Warriors, told the San Francisco Chronicle: "The people are going to go  absolutely crazy for him. He's big, for one thing. And he's obviously looked at  a lot of NBA basketball.  </P> <P> "These Soviet players aren't like they used to be -- mechanical, do it by the  numbers. He's a creative son of a gun. And he'll score."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Notable: Author Peter Gent, former basketball and football player, on athletes:  "Baseball players are the weirdest of all. I think it's all that organ music."  </P> <P> </P> <P> They duck: We know that pitchers have thrown as fast as 100 m.p.h., but how  fast does a batted ball travel?  </P> <P> Pittsburgh pitching coach Ray Miller, who once worked for Baltimore, said: "I  remember one time in Anaheim, we clocked a home run off Eddie Murray's bat at  122 m.p.h. on a Nolan Ryan fastball. When you talk about speeds like that, you  wonder how it is that no pitcher gets killed."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Some choice: From Marty Noble of Newsday: "Of all the baseball players in the  world, why would anyone choose to hold up Kirk Gibson? He might bite the gun."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Trivia answer: Miloslav Mecir of Czechoslovakia. He beat Tim Mayotte of the  United States in the final.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Quotebook: San Diego Padre pitcher Bruce Hurst, who doesn't use profanity,  responding to a particularly abusive fan: "Oh, go wash your car."  </P></p>

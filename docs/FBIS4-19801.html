			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, April 20 (AFP) -- The French Government  decided Wednesday [20 April] to make an exception for the Army  in its budget economy drive and increase spending on military  equipment over the next six years.    The cabinet agreed to set spending at a total 613 billion  francs (105.6 billion dollars) for the years 1995 to 2000, an  "annual increase of 0.5 percent in volume," Government Spokesman  Nicholas Sarkozy said.    This "could go up to 1.5 percent if the economic situation  permits" when the government's five-year spending plan comes up  for revision in 1997, he added.    According to analysts, state spending in other sectors has  been cut by around 0.5 percent per year under the plan, launched  by the centre-right government to contain the public deficit.    The defence proposals must still be approved by both houses  of parliament.    The government's priorities are to maintain the nuclear  deterrent, strengthen conventional forces "to prevent crises and  contain conflicts, reaffirm the link between defence and the  nation (through) the national service and maintaining a strong  arms industry on a European scale," Sarkozy said.    The number of people in the Army would come down gradually,  however, from 606,000 in 1995 to 579,000 in the year 2000, he  added.    Development of the new M5 nuclear missile will also be  delayed, along with the Rafale combat aircraft, and a  cost-cutting exercise has begun for the European transport  helicopter NH-90, a Ministry official said.    President Francois Mitterrand made lengthy remarks in the  cabinet's deliberations, his spokesman Jean Musitelli said  Wednesday without giving details of his contribution.    A well informed source, who did not wish to be identified,  said Mitterrand had underlined his agreement with the spending  programme and shown understanding of the financial restraints  which led to the M5 delay.    The share of spending on nuclear weapons will continue to  fall by about a quarter despite development of a land-based  version of the M4/M45 nuclear submarine missile, to be used from  2005 at the ballistic missile base on the Albion plateau in  south-east France, the Ministry official said.    If its European partners agree, the Ministry also plans to  develop a modular armoured personnel carrier with Germany and  the new Horizon frigate with Italy and Britain, the official  said.</p>

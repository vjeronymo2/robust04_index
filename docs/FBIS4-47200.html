			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Colonel Hryhoriy Omelchenko, member of the </F> Supreme Council Presidium and chairman of the Commission on  Matters To Combat Organized Crime and Corruption, by Aleksandra  Parakhonya; place and date not given: "Hryhoriy Omelchenko: 'We  Will Not Talk Only About the Mafia and Corruption. The Subject  Will Be the Attempts To Destroy Ukraine Economically as an  Independent State!'"]    [Text] As is known, passions raged last Friday in  parliament's session hall. After a political statement by Yu.  Zvyahilskyy and a letter signed by 122 deputies, the session  decided to discuss the question of the situation that had arisen  in connection with the attempt on the life of people's deputy  Vladimir Bortnik.    We understand that an investigation is under way and  that many circumstances and details regarding the tragic events  of 30 May have still not been made known to us. Nevertheless....  are there not too many contradictions in the actions of the  highest-ranking officials? Are there not too many "white spots"  in this--let us say right out--"dark" affair?    Aleksandr Parakhonya, our correspondent, asked Colonel  Hryhoriy Omelchenko, member of the Supreme Council Presidium and  chairman of the Commission on Matters To Combat Organized Crime  and Corruption, to comment on the situation.    [Omelchenko] I like and respect NEZAVISIMOST very much. That  is why, although quite a few journalists have come to me with  similar requests these days, I am granting this interview only  to your newspaper. Neither Yu. Zvyahilskyy's political statement  nor the letter signed by 122 deputies (as is known, People's  Deputies Yu. Spizhenko and Yu. Boldyrev were the organizers for  collecting the signatures) were unexpected by myself personally  and many other people's deputies. Sooner or later, something  similar had to be heard. I would say this: An objective process  connected with the investigation of the criminal case regarding  the attempt on the life of people's deputy Vladimir Bortnik is  under way.    If you recall, I also spoke during that meeting and  requested  that normal conditions be established for the activity of the  investigating operational group and that the safety of the  members of this group and their families be assured.    Incidentally, one Kiev newspaper wrote ironically. It wrote  that Zvyahilskyy is urging a struggle against the mafia, but  Chairman Omelchenko of the commission to combat organized crime  and corruption is proposing to keep silent. How much this  corresponds to the truth, evidently, does not disturb the  newspaper. It is sufficient to read the verbatim report of my  presentation -- here it is, read it!-- and it will be clear that  Omelchenko did not at all suggest to the deputies that there be  silence. However, I do not consider it necessary to engage in  polemics with this provocation; I will treat such statements  with humor. It is natural that this conclusion rang out. It is  fully contained in the chronology of events that we forecast and  which are following one after the other....    I will also not comment on Mr. Zvyahilskyy's political  statement. My evaluation, just as that of any other individual,  is subjective. I can agree with some of it and not with other  parts of it. However, I would gladly put my signature under the  statement's final thesis. In my copy of the session's verbatim  report, that paragraph is marked "nota bene." I will quote it  for the readers of NEZAVISIMOST:    "As a people's deputy of Ukraine performing the duties of  the  Ukraine's prime minister, I demand very decisive measures from  the Ukraine's Supreme Council to protect the national interest  of the state and the honor and dignity of its citizens; the  investigation of all (we stress the word 'all'--G.O.)  circumstances concerning the attempt on the life of people's  deputy Vladimir Bortnik; rigorous observance of law, order, and  legality; and the establishment of an effective legal mechanism."    I vote with both hands for this formulation of the question,  and I will do everything that depends on me so that ALL  circumstances in the Bortnik affair will be investigated with  strict observance of legality and law and order.    [Parakhonya] Are you confident that the one who fired at  Bortnik will be found? Who do you think it is?    [Omelchenko] In this case, who the specific individual is  that made the attempt on the life of the people's deputy is not  as important as who is behind him and who aimed his hand. One  must determine the motives for the crime. As the ancients wisely  said--who benefits?    Some officials hope very much to keep the motives secret. I  will not mention names now for the sake of the investigation. I  will pose the question of establishing a Supreme Council  investigating commission, which will be able to investigate this  matter fully, thoroughly, and objectively, jointly with the  general procurator's investigating operational group, to the  session of the Ukraine's Supreme Council in accordance with  Article 109 of the Constitution--to dig down to the sources and  to the roots! Moreover, I will secure from the Supreme Council  and its Presidium the pronouncement of a decree on conducting a  thorough inspection of the financial and economic activity and  hard currency accounts of the concern that people's deputy  Vladimir Bortnik heads, and also of the other state  institutions, commercial structures, and commercial banks--both  domestic and foreign--with which Ukragrotekhservis has conducted  financial and economic activity. Only by conducting this  comprehensive inspection, and then an expert legal and  bookkeeping examination, can we and you establish (I do not  doubt this!) the true motives for the attempt on Vladimir  Bortnik's life.    Incidentally, Ukraine's Security Service has twice charged  the monitoring and auditing department of Ukraine's Ministry of  Finance to conduct a thorough inspection of the activity of  Ukragrotekhservis and of the state and commercial structures  connected with it. Up until now, this decision of the SBU  [Security Service of Ukraine] has not been carried out. I intend  to raise the question about the responsibility of officials from  the Ministry of Finance's KRU [monitoring and auditing  department] for the failure to implement the Law on the  Organization and Legal Bases for Combating Organized Crime. It  clearly states: The duty of all state structures, including the  KRU, is to carry out rigorously the decisions of the SBU, the  general procurator, the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs], and  other subunits engaged in combating corruption and organized  crime.    I will refrain from evaluating--politically, morally, and  ethically--the strange inactivity of the KRU in this matter. I  will, however, see to it in every way possible that the decree  on the appointment of this inspection body be carried out by the  Supreme Council Presidium, as was done in 1990, when the  Presidium appointed a similar inspection agency to investigate  the circumstances connected with the misappropriation of assets  allocated to eliminate the consequences of the Chernobyl  catastrophe.    The programs of a majority of the people's deputies contain  quite a few correct words and vows to the voters to struggle  resolutely against the mafia and corruption. That is why I  nevertheless believe that my proposal to establish a Supreme  Council investigating commission and to ensure normal conditions  for the work of the operational investigation group's members  will be supported. If we succeed....Lord willing! I hope and am  confident that we will manage to bring this affair to a complete  end, and then.... it is difficult for me to say this phrase; but  then we will no longer talk only about the mafia and corruption  in the highest echelons of power. The subject concerns attempts  to destroy Ukraine economically as an independent state!    No matter what it costs, I will do everything to investigate  this matter until the end.    [Parakhonya] On Friday, extremely serious accusations  addressed to V. Datsyuk, the general procurator, sounded from  the parliament rostrum. It seems to me that some of our deputies  are simply incapable of remembering that they represent the  first, the legislative, and not the third, the judicial, branch.  What is more, Yu. Spizhenko, the minister of health, quoting his  medical colleagues, reported that the police workers who  protected V. Bortnik were drunk....    [Omelchenko] Here on my table are documents: The examination  of the policemen was conducted at the time, 31 May, by the  on-duty medical personnel at that same emergency hospital. All  were sober and acted in accurate compliance with instructions. I  will say one thing: Neither Yu. Zvyahilskyy nor Yu. Spizhenko,  who arrived during the night at the hospital where the wounded  deputy was located, have any justifying motives. Yes, a vital  need to send V. Bortnik abroad could have arisen (we will not  specify--did it arise?) in order to provide him with qualified  medical help there. However, knowing that the wounded man was  under protection and that an investigation was being  conducted--however, they were not able to know about this--it  was necessary, at a minimum, to secure the permission of  Ukraine's procurator general to see the patient.    [Parakhonya] Perhaps I am posing the question amateurishly;  however, the supposition suggests itself that a concern for V.  Bortnik's health was not the only reason for his urgent dispatch  abroad. It looks as if something else worried the organizers of  this trip. Was it impossible to allow the leaking of some  information?    [Omelchenko] The question is not at all amateurish. You are  looking directly at the root. I can answer--in the aspect, let  us say, of a version. It is one of the working versions of the  investigation. In addition, I can justify this version using  evidence existing today. I will not do this for one simple  reason--so as not to agitate unnecessarily public opinion about  this criminal case. However, I promise your readers that I will  tell everything without fail as soon as it is possible to do so  without harming the interests of the investigation.    Knowing practically all aspects of this criminal case and  everything that is occurring around it, I was again convinced  that we vitally needed a note about Section 4 of Article 111 in  the Constitution and Articles 27 and 28 in the law concerning  the status of a people's deputy in Ukraine. The subject in them  concerns a deputy's immunity. I intend to submit the question of  the repeal of these articles to the Supreme Council session.    The deputy's immunity, which our people's deputies possess  at  all levels, no longer exists anywhere in the world. This is some  kind of feudalism! I think that the law's propositions  concerning who can institute proceedings against a people's  deputy should be formulated approximately as follows: "A  criminal case concerning a people's deputy of Ukraine can be  instituted by the general procurator, oblast procurator,  procurator of the cities of Kiev and Sevastopol, or persons  acting as general procurator, procurators of the oblasts, and  procurators given the same status as them. The criminal case  should be heard by Ukraine's Supreme Court." Concerning deputies  of local soviets, a criminal case against a deputy should be  instituted by the appropriate procurator--rayon, city, or  oblast--and heard by the oblast court.    That is all! There should not be any other limitations in  the  criminal procedure or any special procedure for instituting  criminal proceedings against deputies.    [Parakhonya] However, you see, provocations, squaring of  accounts, etc., are possible against deputies (and against you  also--no, against you in particular).    [Omelchenko] If a deputy does not break the law, does not  commit crimes, and is not connected with the mafia and corrupted  commercial structures, banks, etc., he has no reason to fear  anything or to be apprehensive--the more so since a procurator,  before instituting criminal proceedings against a people's  deputy, will weigh and recheck everything a thousand times--the  responsibility is too great.    I consider the problem of a deputy's immunity to be the  Rubicon which our Supreme Council simply must cross.    [Parakhonya] I very much doubt that parliament will take  this  step.    [Omelchenko] Let the deputies recall their campaign  promises,  programs, and vows to fight against the mafia and corruption.  They are able to carry them out and show precisely how the  question of a deputy's immunity will be solved. It will become a  kind of litmus-paper that will immediately reveal who is who.    [Parakhonya] You will insist on a role-call vote?    [Omelchenko] Simply!    [Parakhonya] It seems that the case of V. Bortnik has shown  how vulnerable our deputy's immunity is. By no means do I have  in mind only the fact that a people's deputy with his immunity  can be wounded, just like any other ordinary mortal. Certain  forces behind the scenes can also direct his actions. The fact  of under what conditions and how the question was decided to  send V. Bortnik urgently to Vienna testifies to the sweeping  capabilities of the "opposite side." The work of the  investigating operational group and the Commission on Matters To  Combat Organized Crime and Corruption will encounter (is already  encountering?) a certain opposition.    Or is this a secret? If possible, a few words about the  operational investigating group.    [Omelchenko] Let us begin with the latter. The group  contains  high class professionals from the general procurator's office,  SBU, and MVD--investigators and operational workers. Working  indefatigably, the investigators work approximately 16-18 hours  a day. The operational people work even more; the week that  passed after the day of the crime was practically a week without  sleep for them.    Now about the opposition. However strange it may seem, one  must render it its due. Anonymous "well-wishers" somehow know  the home telephone numbers of the members of the group that is  investigating this criminal case. Recommendations, so to say,  "not to dig deeply" were first addressed to them. Next,  blackmail was set in motion in the case--promises to publish  some devastating material that would compromise the group's  leadership. Threats of physical violence have also already been  heard.    [Parakhonya] You see, the lads in the investigating  operational group have wives, children....    [Omelchenko] That is why the group's members were forced to  take definite actions to protect the life and health of their  relatives and relations and, naturally, take a number of  necessary steps to establish conditions--even if only  minimal--for the group's normal functioning.    [Parakhonya] In your view, how will the situation develop?    [Omelchenko] It will be possible to see a great deal after  parliament adopts a decision to establish a Supreme Council  investigating commission, and when a decision has been taken at  the Presidium level, to conduct a thorough financial and  economic review of Ukragrotekhservis and the structures  connected with it. At that time, events will begin to develop  swiftly.    [Parakhonya] Are you confident that an affair of this scope  will be a unique one in your work as chairman of the  parliamentary commission?    [Omelchenko] It is not the attempt itself on the deputy's  life but that which is connected with this case that does not at  all surprise me. This case is one of an extremely average level,  since today corruption and the mafia clans have actually eaten  away at the state. The people have probably lost faith already  in the ability to conquer this terrible evil. One would like to  believe that this Supreme Council is able to do something  useful. Would that God would let us establish a special subunit  in the SBU to fight corruption, which has still not been  established, including through the fault of the former Supreme  Council. It is no less urgent to adopt--even if only the first  ones--laws regarding the struggle against corruption and  organized crime and to give a legal definition of the concepts:  "mafia," "corruption," and "organized crime." The Supreme  Council planned to do this last year; however....    [Parakhonya] You said that people have probably already lost  faith in the fact that it is possible to defeat the mafia and  corruption. You and those who are engaged in investigations  possess information that is not even dreamed about in a terrible  dream; have you preserved this faith?    [Omelchenko] That is a very difficult question.... Sometimes  workers engaged in combating corruption and organized crime  remind one of Don Quixote or fanatics who continue their  struggle despite any logic. They beat their heads against the  wall and the result is often nothing....    I will speak frankly. Previously, specialists in this field  at times left the work because the pay did not suit them. I do  not wish to judge them; each has his own problems and living  circumstances. However, young people are now leaving us at times  for quite different moral and ethical motives: The work is  dangerous and risky and is running free. To beat one's head  against a wall is a dishonorable occupation.    I want to emphasize once again: The adoption of radical and  very decisive legal measures to combat this terrible evil is  necessary--of course, with the parallel adoption of economic  laws. However, without legal ones, economic laws (you see, where  is corruption rooted?--in the economy) will not work. If we do  not repeal a deputy's immunity, one can give up the struggle  against corruption and the mafia as a lost cause.</p>

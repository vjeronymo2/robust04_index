			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The ANC [African National Congress] has warned  financial institutions against involvement in the  90-billion-rand housing program announced by the minister of  national housing, Mr. Louis Shill. The party said it would not  recognize any such contracts signed before the election, and  said the scheme would have to be sanctioned by the Transitional  Executive Council before being implemented. The ANC added that  it would oppose any attempt by the National Party to preempt the  electoral right of the voters to pass their judgment on housing.    The Transitional Executive Council has decided that the  scheme should be suspended until differences on the issue have  been resolved. Mr. Shill claimed that politically motivated  organizations wanted the provision of housing delayed until a  new government was in power.</p>

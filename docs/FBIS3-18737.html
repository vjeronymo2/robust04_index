			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Italian General Confederation of Labor [CGIL]  has come out against Forza Italia, the Northern League, and the  National Alliance, using a manner of violent language that has  never been heard in the preelection period. Sandro Roazzi  reports:    [Roazzi] Bruno Trentin has come out against Silvio  Berlusconi, Gianfranco Fini, and Umberto Bossi. He said that  they are the leaders of a dangerous right that threatens workers  and the development of the country.    [Begin Trentin recording] No one, not even Ronald Reagan,  has planned such an attack on the rights of the individual and  the trades unions--an attack on the constitutional rights  obtained by the Italian workers over the past 30 years. [end  recording]    [Roazzi] This is why the CGIL will discuss its numerous  proposals on job-related matters and development only with  individuals from those groups led by Mario Segni and Fausto  Bertinotti. He said that Berlusconi's proposals on taxes and  the social services were only empty slogans, which would either  lead to an increase in the rate of inflation or to new social  injustice.    The CGIL is asking that workers' salaries, companies, and  homes have some protection from the tax office. Nevertheless,  all forms of wealth should be taxed, including shares in the  newly privatized state industries. However, such taxes should  be very low and should exclude the small investor.</p>

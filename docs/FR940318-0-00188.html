			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (b) HCFC&hyph;22. HCFC&hyph;22 is acceptable as a Halon 1301 substitute. This agent is subject to the use conditions delineated in the discussion of total flooding agents in this section. HCFC&hyph;22 has an extinguishment concentration, as determined by cup burner in heptane, of 11.6 percent and a design concentration of 13.9 percent, the highest of the candidate HCFCs. Its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimated explosion inertion concentration is 18.8 percent. Its weight and volume equivalence are 2.4 percent and 3.0 percent, respectively. The cardiotoxic NOAEL is 2.5 percent and its LOAEL is 5.0 percent. This compound is unlikely to be feasible as a pure agent in occupied areas because its design concentration exceeds its cardiotoxic effect level.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ODP for HCFC&hyph;22 is 0.05, the 100 year-GWP is 1600, and the atmospheric  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lifetime is 16 years. Its ODP and GWP are both higher than those for other candidate HCFCs. This agent is schedule for production phaseout under the CAA for new equipment in the year 2010 and for existing equipment in the year 2020 (58 FR 65018).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) HCFC&hyph;124. HCFC&hyph;124 is acceptable as a Halon 1301 substitute. This agent is subject to the use conditions delineated in the discussion of total flooding agents in this section. HCFC&hyph;124 has relatively low ODP of .022, and, compared to other candidate 1301 substitutes for which GWP has been estimated, has a relatively low 100-year GWP value of 440 with an atmospheric lifetime of 7 years. Animal testing indicates that the substance may be lethal to rats at a level greater than 23 percent over a four hour period. The substance has a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cardiotoxic LOAEL of 2.5 percent and a NOAEL apparent at 1.0 percent. Its weight and volume equivalence is 2.6 and 2.9 respectively. The extinguishing concentration based on cup burner tests in heptane of HCFC&hyph;124 is 7.0 percent and its design concentration is 8.4 percent, while its explosion inertion concentration is 12.0 percent. This compound is unlikely to be feasible as a total flooding agent in normally occupied areas because its design  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentration exceeds its cardiotoxic level.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) (HCFC BLEND) A. (HCFC BLEND) A is acceptable as a Halon 1301 substitute. This agent is subject to the use conditions delineated in the discussion of total flooding agents in this section. Based on full-scale testing, the extinguishing concentration of this blend has been determined to be approximately 7.2 percent and therefore the design concentration is approximately 8.6 percent. The cardiotoxic NOAEL of this blend is 10.0 percent, and the LOAEL is at least 10.0 percent. Until further data is supplied, the Agency considers its LOAEL to be 10 percent. The major component of this blend has an ODP of 0.05, higher than other proposed HCFC substitutes, but the blend appears somewhat more effective from a weight and storage volume  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equivalency basis, which is 1.6 and 2.3 respectively. This compound is a feasible candidate for use in a normally occupied area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This agent is a blend of different HCFCs. The predominant component of this blend is HCFC&hyph;22, which has an ODP of 0.05, an atmospheric lifetime of 16 years, and a GWP of 1600. HCFC&hyph;22 is scheduled for production phaseout under the CAA by the year 2020 and all other HCFCs by the year 2030 (58 FR 65018).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) HFC&hyph;23. HFC&hyph;23 is acceptable as a Halon 1301 substitute. This agent is subject to the use conditions delineated in the discussion of total flooding agents in this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HFC&hyph;23 is attractive for use as a total flooding agent in occupied areas because the cardiotoxic NOAEL is at least 30 percent without added oxygen and over 50 percent with added oxygen, compared to a design concentration of 14.4 percent, based on cup burner tests in heptane. EPA recognizes that no cardiotoxic effect was measured in the tests of HFC&hyph;23, and acknowledges that tests were terminated when oxygen levels decreased to a point posing risk of asphyxiation. However, EPA must examine this agent in the light of potential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cardiotoxicity because this is a halocarbon which does possess cardiotoxic characteristics. It is an artifact of the test protocol that determines that the NOAEL and LOAEL must be interpreted from the data, and not interpolated. To observe a cardiotoxic effect would require quantities in such high concentration as to pose a risk of asphyxiation before risk of cardiotoxicity. Because testing was stopped at 30 percent without added oxygen and 50 per  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cent with added oxygen, EPA must use these values as the maximum allowable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentrations. In the NPRM, EPA did not refer to a specific LOAEL for this agent. However, the standard OSHA-derived language was included for all agents. In this rulemaking, EPA is using the values of 30 percent for the NOAEL and 50% for the LOAEL.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Compared to an inerting concentration in methane of 20.5 percent and an inerting design concentration of 22.6 percent in methane, this agent is an excellent candidate for use in explosion inertion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As mentioned earlier, the risk of using agents in high concentrations poses a risk of asphyxiation by displacing oxygen. With an ambient oxygen level of 21 percent, a design concentration of 22.6 percent will reduce oxygen levels to approximately 16 percent, the minimum oxygen level considered to be required to prevent impaired judgement or other physiological effects. The weight equivalent of HFC&hyph;23 is 1.6 while its storage volume  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equivalent is 2.6. This agent requires a high pressure system for proper discharge and dispersion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

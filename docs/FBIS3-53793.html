			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bengali </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A spokesman of the Foreign Office described Indian  press reports as fabricated and motivated. The reports were  published recently in a section of the Indian press and alleged  that the Inter-Services Intelligence [ISI] of Pakistan is  carrying out terrorist activities from Bangladeshi soil.  Speaking in Dhaka today, he said these concocted reports were  published in Indian newspapers at a time when both Bangladesh  and India are making efforts to forge closer ties between them  on the basis of mutual understanding. The spokesman said that  such motivated news will obstruct the development of a cordial  relationship between the two neighboring countries. He  expressed the hope that they will refrain from creating this  type of unrealistic propaganda.</p>

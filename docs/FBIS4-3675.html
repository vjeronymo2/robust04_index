			<p>BFN     [Text] Manila, April 25 (XINHUA) -- President Fidel Ramos  today called for intensified economic cooperation between the  Philippines and China, particularly in the field of science and  technology.    Ramos made the call during his meeting with a Chinese  National People's Congress [NPC] delegation led by Zhu Liang,  chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee.    He emphasized that the Philippines can benefit from China's  advanced science and technology, saying he was impressed with  China's laser laboratory in Beijing which he visited during his  trip in China last year.    Ramos said that one of the agreements reached during the  Asia  Pacific economic cooperation meeting in the United States last  November was the transfer of technology from developed countries  to the developing ones, especially their science and applied  technology for small and medium enterprises.    The Chinese delegation arrived here on April 21 after a  visit  to Thailand.    During its stay in the country, the delegation met with  House  Speaker Jose de Venecia, Senate President Edgardo Angara and  Foreign Secretary Roberto Romulo.    The Chinese delegation is scheduled to leave for home on  April 27.</p>

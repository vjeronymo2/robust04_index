			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Opec output rise set to continue - Geneva meeting expected to add Dollars 1 a barrel to crude prices Crude prices could rise by more than Dollars 1 a barrel after the meeting of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries which begins tomorrow in Geneva, analysts say. However, any agreement is likely to have little effect on the organisation's real oil output. Opec allocated each member a temporary production ceiling, adding up to 22.98m barrels, at its February meeting. But since it rolled this over at its last meeting in May, albeit with the proviso that war-damaged Kuwait be allowed to increase production at will, it has been pumping at close to its capacity. Observers believe Opec has good reason to reach an agreement that will allow production to continue rising gradually from about 24.3m barrels a day in the last quarter to between 24.5m and 24.8m b/d in the next. With demand in the coming quarter forecast to be at least 25m b/d, the result would be a healthy oil price. Mr Mehdi Varzi, Opec-watcher at Kleinwort Benson in London, believes even the traditional price 'doves', notably Saudi Arabia, will support a higher price. The fall in value of the dollar - the currency in which oil is traded - has decreased oil revenues by more than 10 per cent to some Opec members. Even wealthier members can no longer afford low prices, and are likely to push the price towards the price hawks' target of Dollars 21 a barrel for the Opec basket of crudes. Opec has some potentially acrimonious battles ahead - principally over how it will adjust present market shares to absorb Iraq when the United Nations allows it to recommence oil exports. However, observers believe the organisation will be anxious to avoid such battles until its next meeting in November. Mr Vahan Zanoyan, consultant with the Petroleum Finance Company of Washington, says many members are too preoccupied with their own domestic politics to risk political clashes with their neighbours. Analysts believe there are therefore two possible outcomes to the Geneva meeting. Mr Joe Stanislaw, of Paris-based consultancy Cambridge Energy Research Associates, believes the 22.98m b/d quota will be rolled over for the second quarter running. The assumption, however, would be that real output would be around 24.6m b/d. He feels that this is the most sensible solution, given that Opec may need to incorporate Iraq by the first quarter of next year and could face lower demand, meaning members would have to decrease output. 'Once you formally raise the quota for everyone it becomes much harder to bring it down again,' he says. However, Mr Zanoyan says Opec might make a 'meaningful' increase in its production ceiling to a level slightly below its production capacity - probably 24.5m to 24.7m b/d. This would give prices a boost as it might restore faith among the world's oil markets that Opec was taking its responsibility seriously and was likely to stick broadly to such a quota. However, such a rise would have to be applied across the board, with a pro rata increase in each member's temporary production ceiling, otherwise it could precipitate the very row about market shares which members want to avoid. Either option would be likely to provoke a rise in the oil price of up to Dollars 1 a barrel after the meeting, on expectations of tight demand. Observers say the price could rise by another dollar or more depending on the severity of winter weather. Nervousness about Opec's November meeting could also put pressure on prices. Most observers expect the net result to be the target price of Dollars 21 for the Opec basket of crudes (equivalent to around Dollars 23 for Brent crude) being reached before the end of the year - good news for Opec's price hawks and the oil companies.</p>

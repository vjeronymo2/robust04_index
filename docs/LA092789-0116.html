			<p><P> September 27, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SANTIAGO CANYON ROAD STUDY;  </P> <P> LIGHTS IN DAYTIME CUT ACCIDENT RATE  </P> <P> The accident rate on Santiago Canyon Road dropped 58% after a program  encouraging drivers to use headlights during the daylight hours was introduced,  a new study shows.  </P> <P> Accidents rates are computed on the number of accidents per million vehicle  miles. The total number of accidents on the 13-mile stretch of two-lane highway  between Orange and Trabuco Canyon decreased by seven in 1987 and 1988 compared  to the previous two-year period, despite a more than 100% increase in the daily  traffic volume, according to the study. The number of accidents dropped from 81  to 74. No statistics were provided on numbers of deaths and injuries.  </P> <P> The study is the first comparing accident trends since daytime headlight  programs were implemented throughout Orange County over the past five years.  Other programs are in effect on the Ortega Highway and Laguna Canyon Road.  While use of daytime headlights is voluntary, surveys by police and county  engineers show a compliance rate of between 50% and 70%.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'An Outstanding Program'  </P> <P> A county engineer who conducted the study cautioned that due to drastic changes  in traffic volume and patterns, the study is not scientific.  </P> <P> But law enforcement officials said the findings reinforce their belief that the  headlight program is succeeding in reducing accidents.  </P> <P> "It's an outstanding program for our area," said Officer Mike Lundquist,  spokesman for the Santa Ana division of the California Highway Patrol.  Lundquist said the 58% reduction is "probably one of the highest in the state."  </P> <P> While more recent accident figures are not available, Lundquist said the trend  appears to continue downward. CHP Motorcycle Officer Wally Seibert, for  example, said he has noticed a decrease in accidents in his early-morning  patrols of the highway.  </P> <P> "I think they (daytime headlights) work," Seibert said. "It's a visual thing.  It's like with motorcycles. Someone sees that your headlights are on and it's  easier to see the vehicle."  </P> <P> Caltrans posted signs asking for daytime headlights along Santiago Canyon Road  in September, 1986, at the request of the California Highway Patrol, after 10  fatalities and 109 injuries resulted from traffic accidents there between Jan.  1, 1984, and Dec. 31, 1985. Although the roadway's overall accident rate at the  time was well below state averages, the severity of accidents was such that  Capt. C.A. Lynd of the CHP's Santa Ana division asked for the signs.  </P> <P> A CalTrans study at the time of 10 other headlight programs outside of Orange  County found that the total accident rate was reduced 18% after the posting of  headlight signs.  </P> <P> The Santiago Canyon Road study, completed Aug. 1, found even more dramatic  reductions.  </P> <P> James Swatzel, a county senior civil engineer who conducted the study, also  documented significant reductions in types of accidents. Accidents in which  vehicles were sideswiped decreased from 16 in the previous two-year period to  nine in the next two-year period, the report found. The number of accidents  involving overturned vehicles dropped from 16 to six over the same time  periods. And accidents related to unsafe speed decreased from 25 to 19,  according to the report.  </P> <P> Although some accident categories showed small increases, Swatzel noted that  there had been such a large increase in traffic on the roadway that a net  reduction in the accident rate still occurred.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Traffic Volume Doubled  </P> <P> The traffic volume doubled from 6,000 vehicles per day to 12,000 vehicles per  day in one six-mile stretch of road between Silverado Canyon and Live Oak  Canyon, the report found. Traffic volume on the remaining seven-mile stretch  between Silverado Canyon and Chapman Road increased from 11,000 vehicles daily  to 16,000, the report said.  </P> <P> Although no similar studies have been conducted on Ortega Highway or Laguna  Canyon Road, law enforcement officers there say they are also seeing accident  reductions.  </P> <P> The signs went up in June, 1985, along a 14-mile stretch of Ortega Highway,  where CHP statistics showed there were 87 major accidents resulting in 95  injuries and four deaths during 1984. Headlight signs also went up in 1984 on a  five-mile stretch of Laguna Canyon Road between the San Diego Freeway and El  Toro Road because of a concentration of serious accidents there.  </P> <P> Headlight signs "make people more aware that this is a problem area and it  makes oncoming vehicles more visible," said Laguna Beach Police Sgt. Linda  Parker. "It makes them more alert."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cut Estimated at 25%  </P> <P> Use of headlight signs and a CHP radar enforcement program have combined to  reduce accidents along the Ortega Highway by as much as 25%, said Lt. Michael  Bair of the CHP office in San Juan Capistrano. Bair said the figure was an  estimate.  </P> <P> "I think the headlight program is helping not so much for visibility but to  remind drivers . . . that there is something a little unique about driving this  highway," Bair said.  </P> <P> As successful as the headlight programs seem to be, Swatzel warned in his  report that the lights should not be considered a general solution. It is the  fact that the lights are unusual that gets the attention of drivers, Swatzel  said.  </P> <P> "Any proliferation of this method will render it completely ineffective, he  said."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Daylight Headlights Reduce Accidents  </P> <P> Accidents along Santiago Canyon Road between Chapman Avenue and Live Oak Canyon  Raod decreased dramatically when drivers were asked during a test period to use  their headlights during daylight hours. Despite a 100% increase in traffic in a  portion of the road between that period and a period which headlights were not  required, the daylight headlight test indicated an overall accident rate  reduction of about 58%  </P> <P> </P> <P> Accident Rate  </P> <P> </P> <P> Two-year period before daytime headlight implementation  </P> <P> </P> <P> Chapman to Peters Cyn: .82  </P> <P> Peters Cyn to Silverado Cyn: .91  </P> <P> Silverado Cyn to Modjeska Cyn: 1.11  </P> <P> Modjeska Cyn to Live Oak Cyn: .99  </P> <P> </P> <P> Two-year period after daytime headlight implementation  </P> <P> </P> <P> Chapman to Peters Cyn: .58  </P> <P> Peters Cyn to Silverado Cyn: .54  </P> <P> Silverado Cyn to Modjeska Cyn: .76  </P> <P> Modjeska Cyn to Live Oak Cyn: .42  </P></p>

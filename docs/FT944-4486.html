			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / After The VAT Vote: Clarke acts 'to check inflation' - Decision to increase rate was based on economic factors, say officials Yesterday's half percentage point increase in bank base rates came after high political drama the night before. But, if officials are to be believed, the minutes of the early morning meeting between Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Eddie George, the Bank of England governor, should show, when published in six weeks' time, that the decision was based on economic factors. Before the two men met at 8.45am - rather than 9.30 as originally scheduled  -officials from the Bank and the Treasury had concluded that the economy was growing so fast that base rates should be raised to keep inflationary pressures under control. It is understood that Mr Clarke himself had all but decided to raise rates this month before Tuesday night's vote on value added tax on domestic fuel. The time of the meeting was only changed after the government's defeat, however. Yesterday Mr Clarke said that he and the governor 'were in total agreement on the move'. As the chancellor did the rounds of the television and radio studios at lunchtime yesterday to explain the rates increase to 6.25 per cent from 5.75 per cent he did not give the appearance of a man pressed into unwelcome action by political misfortune. Mr George's announcement of the increase immediately after the meeting at about 9.40am took some observers by surprise but was determined by market factors. The chancellor said that there were no reasons for delay and the governor 'wanted to avoid market uncertainties'. The Bank wanted the news in the public domain before final bids were due for an auction of Pounds 2bn of 10-year gilt-edged government stock at 10am. It also wanted clarity over official rates because it was arranging new two-week and one-month securities repurchase and secured loan facilities for its money market operations yesterday morning. The decisive factor that persuaded the Bank and Treasury to push for the first December base rate rise since the 1970s was last month's sharp upward revision of the third-quarter growth of gross domestic product. Although the UK is enjoying an unusually favourable pattern of growth the news that GDP was rising by 4.2 per cent compared with the third quarter of last year set alarm bells ringing in Whitehall and Threadneedle Street. Experience suggests that the UK's long-term trend rate of non-inflationary growth is about 2 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Although this may have risen because of supply side reforms in 1980s, it was clear to Treasury and Bank economists that the economy was using up the spare capacity created by the recession at a faster rate than thought. According to Mr Alan Budd, the government's chief economic adviser, the 'output gap' - the difference between the actual level of GDP and the level that would exist if it had grown at its long-term trend rate in recent years  -has probably fallen to between 1 per cent and 4 per cent. The Treasury said there was further evidence of growth in its statement explaining the rise, and also in its monthly monetary report prepared for yesterday's meeting. It pointed to recent business surveys which suggested that growth would remain strong, as well as rising orders, particularly in the export sector. Unemployment in October fell 46,000, continuing its downward trend. Although retailers are complaining about tough competitive conditions, sales volumes - up 3.3 per cent in the year to October - have continued the upward trend of the past two years. Yesterday's news that manufacturing output was a seasonally adjusted 0.5 per cent higher in October than in September, and 5.5 per cent higher than in the previous October, confirmed the strength of the recovery. Altogether, these factors argued for immediate action, rather than leaving the rate increase until January or relying on higher taxes due in April to brake the economy. Nonetheless, Mr Clarke is aware that parts of the economy are subdued. Last week he said the housing market was 'extremely flat'. Yesterday's Treasury report painted a picture of falling prices, weak sales activity and declining housing starts. It was no accident that mortgage lenders were in no rush yesterday to follow the Bank of England and clearing banks in pushing up their lending rates. As Mr Clarke pointed out, inflation is also very low. Underlying inflation, which excludes mortgage interest payments, was 2 per cent and at a 27-year low for the second month running in October. But inflation pressures are growing and these tipped the judgment in favour of a rate increase. Commodity prices have started to rise again after falling back in recent months. Input prices for UK manufacturers were 7.1 per cent higher in October than a year before. Producer output prices rose 3.5 per cent at an annual rate in the three months to October and recent Confederation of British Industry surveys point to growing numbers of industrialists wanting to raise prices. Yesterday's base rate rise puts a shot across their bows ahead of the new year, when list prices are normally increased sharply. It is also a warning to wage bargainers that Mr Clarke will not brook inflationary settlements. As in September, when base rates were raised by half a percentage point from 5.25 per cent, the chancellor is keeping ahead of the curve, acting pre-emptively to nip inflationary pressures in the bud. His goal is still to have underlying inflation in the lower part of the government's 1 per cent to 4 per cent target range by the end of this parliament. Yesterday Mr Clarke showed that he was not afraid to be cast as Scrooge ahead of Christmas. He insisted that the higher rates would ensure that the recovery would be sustained, leading to higher living standards and more employment. In a week when political horizons may have shortened, he was still talking the language of a medium-term economic strategy.</p>

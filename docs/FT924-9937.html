			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Technology: Printed circuit pioneer - Obituary Paul Eisler, who died last week aged 85, was a prolific inventor whose major technological innovation - the printed circuit - accelerated the development of modern electronics. That he amassed neither great wealth nor fame as a consequence of his ingenuity seems to have been a product both of his times and of his somewhat nave and remote personality. Financial reward was rarely at the forefront of his thoughts; he thought of printed circuits primarily as his contribution to Britain's war effort. A Viennese Jew, Eisler left Austria in 1936 ahead of the rising Nazi tide and settled in England where he was to remain for the rest of his life. His career, while busy and eventful, was also dogged by disappointment and rejection although he betrayed few signs of bitterness in his 1989 autobiography. Eisler's genius was both theoretical and practical; not only did he see that the tangled mass of wires which characterised electrical circuits in the first half of the century could be replaced by metallic tracks bonded to an insulating layer, his experience in printing technology led him to develop a manufacturing method, foil etching, which is still in use today. His work led to miniaturisation, to the integrated circuit or silicon chip and, most important, to the low-cost mass production of electronic circuitry. He remembers showing a radio he constructed using one of the first printed circuits to Plessey in 1936. The company rejected it on the grounds that it would replace women on the production line. Eisler reserved his animosity for bureaucrats who got in the way of invention, harbouring special disgust for the National Research Development Corporation, founded by the Labour government in 1949 to commercialise the products of publicly funded research. 'The treatment which my inventions received from the NRDC has made me wonder again and again why this organisation has been so grossly inefficient in doing the job for which Parliament had created it,' he wrote, concluding that political games sapped the energies of its officers so they could not deal sensibly with inventors and inventions.</p>

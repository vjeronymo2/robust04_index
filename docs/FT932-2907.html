			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / UK Company News: FKI advances to Pounds 38.1m - Workforce falls by 1,000 and another 800 to go this year FKI, the electrical engineering group which has seen its shares nearly triple in value in the last 18 months, confirmed that it was making progress in focusing the business. Pre-tax profits increased from Pounds 20.7m to Pounds 38.1m in the year to March 31, although the increase was flattered by the adoption of FRS 3, which moved Pounds 9m of extraordinary charges above the line. Turnover rose from Pounds 739.1m to Pounds 756.1m and earnings per share increased to 6.2p (2.65p). Before FRS 3, the previous year's figure was 4.88p, so underlying earnings growth was 27 per cent. A final dividend of 1.8p gives a total of 3p (2.3p), up 30 per cent. The profits were struck after Pounds 5.4m of reorganisation costs. The workforce was reduced by 1,000 to 11,800 and is likely to fall to about 11,000 in the current year, during which which a similar level of reorganisation costs will be incurred. Mr Jeff Whalley, chairman, said: 'These are excellent results achieved against a background of continuing tough market conditions in our main markets in the UK and North America and reflect solid progress in improving profitability and restructuring the businesses. I look forward to the future with confidence.' FKI has sold half of the Pounds 40m of assets it last year identified as non-core. Considerable progress has been made in improving profitability across the group, with operating margins on continuing activities up from 4.5 to 5.9 per cent. Four of FKI's five trading groups - material handling, hardware, automotive and engineering - improved results, with automotive returning to the black. The exception was process control, which saw operating profits fall from Pounds 8.8m to Pounds 5.2m. More than a third of the total reorganisation expenditure was directed at process control. Strong operating cashflow helped gearing fall from 27 to 24 per cent. COMMENT So far, so good. Mr Bob Beeston, who was brought in from BTR at the beginning of last year as managing director, has been rewarded with the post of chief executive for his success in slashing costs and pricing more aggressively. Unfortunately, the three groups with most potential - hardware, materials handling and automotive - are all mainly in the US, so FKI may be tempted to go for a significant business in the UK. Analysts would welcome bolt-on acquisitions to exploit excess automotive capacity. However, they would be less keen on a large paper-funded acquisition. Forecast earnings of about Pounds 50m put the shares, down 3 1/2 p to 138p, on a prospective multiple of 17. FKI's confidence in the scope for enhancing margins to more than 10 per cent bodes well for the long term. But after such a good run, the shares may mark time until acquisition intentions become clearer.</p>

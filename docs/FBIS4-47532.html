Ovchinnikov at Russia's  Academy of Sciences, Moscow; UDC 547.963.32.057:577.213.3]    [Abstract] The difficulty of chemical enzymatic synthesis  and cloning of artificial oligomer genes of short peptides,  e.g., oxytocin, by traditional methods, probably due to the fact  that recurrent sequences in DNA may cause varying recombinant  restructuring, prompted attempts to use different codons in the  synthesized structures in order to diminish the homology of  individual polynucleotide segments for encoding the same amino  acids. To this end, a vector obtained by splitting the pFPCP10  plasmid by the BamHI and EcoRI restrictase  was used for cloning the B/E gene and a vector  obtained by splitting the pTE2IL3 plasmid by the  HindIII and EcoRI restrictase was used for  cloning the H/E gene. Deletions caused by ruptures in  one of the plasmid DNA chains were noted in the experiment to  clone a synthetic oxytocin trimer gene; it is stressed that  these deletions are much less frequent when cloning a  covalent-closed cyclical two-stranded DNA. These recurrent gene  sequence cloning feature may also be observed in other cases. It  is speculated that the difficulties related to these deletions  or recombinations could be overcome by using the techniques  which were verified in this study.

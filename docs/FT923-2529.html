			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading IT WAS another heavy trading session in derivatives markets as securities houses and private investors struggled to come to terms with higher interest rates in the UK, as well as the possibility of an ERM revaluation, writes Terry Byland. The September future on the FT-SE Index, which expires tomorrow, had traded just over 23,000 contracts by the official close and remained active later as sterling came under further pressure. The contract swung between a low of 2,285 and a closing quotation of 2,410, the final figure showing a premium of around 8 points against the underlying cash index. Throughout the day, stock index futures took their cue from the London money and foreign exchange markets. Traders continued to attempt to roll business over from the September to the December contract, which takes over market leadership on Friday, but all other factors were overwhelmed by the increase in UK minimum lending rate. Traded options volume jumped from 33,293 contracts to 51,062, one of the highest daily totals since April. The FT-SE option took the lion's share, with 26,669 against 15,459, with the Euro FT-SE also active on 2,848 contracts.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Heavy Responsibilities of the Japan That </F> Said `No'"]    [Text] It is said that in a mature diplomatic  relationship, it sometimes is necessary "to agree not to agree."    The summit meeting between Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa  and U.S. President Bill Clinton came to an unprecedented  conclusion with no joint statement issued. At their meeting,  the two leaders made straightforward assertions, choosing not to  be compelled to reach a cosmetic agreement. This should be  considered a sign that the post-Cold War relationship between  Japan and the United States is entering a new, mature stage.    Whether setting "numerical targets" to measure the extent of  openness of Japan's markets is right or wrong is not all that  matters in the Japan-U.S. relations. As President Clinton has  pointed out, Japan and the United States share common interests  regarding the situation o the Korean peninsula. The two nations  have also reconfirmed close cooperation regarding common global  issues which include aid to Russia, the ronment, population  control, and AIDS.    We should not be preoccupied with "the breakdown in  negotiations and failure to reach an agreement" regarding the  framework trade talks and overlook the steady progress being  made by the two nations toward strengthening bilateral ties as a  whole, including expanding cooperation among their private  companies. "Japan and the United States can endure even if they  fail to agree on certain points," (as stated by President  Clinton.) That is the way it ought to be.    It is desired that both nations will take advantage of the  cooling-off period to resume talks at mature levels. The  maintenance of good bilateral relations is important for the  security of Asia, as well as the rest of the world.    If bilateral relations are actually maturing, what is most  needed is for the two nations to fulfill their roles as mature  nations. In this respect, Japan -- which said what it had to  say, and, for the first time, said "no" to what it cannot do --  must now carry out what can be done promptly and infallibly.    In particular, it is most urgent for Japan to carry out  deregulation and improve procedures regarding government  procurement -- measures which can be implemented under the  government's own responsibility. Not only must Japan hasten  steps toward a domestic-demand-oriented economic recovery by  implementing versatile fiscal and monetary measures, but it must  also apply the Antimonopoly Law more strictly to create a fairer  and more open market.    In short, the government needs to prove that "Japan has  changed." We urge Prime Minister Hosokawa to exercise his  leadership, taking the initiative to persuade those forces which  resist reform.    Japan rejected a U.S. demand for introducing numerical  targets in priority areas in the framework trade talks, such as  automobiles and insurance services, on the grounds that it would  lead to managed trade and run contrary to the principle of  deregulation. This is only natural. Japanese and U.S. scholars  and numerous foreign news media, including those of the United  States, support Japan's position.    We urge the United States to reconsider its position and try  to find other ways to promote access to Japanese markets. We  cannot agree with the idea of setting unilateral numerical  targets and approaching bilateral trade talks with threats of  imposing legal sanctions against Japan.    An outline of the framework trade talks was agreed upon last  July during a meeting between Kiichi Miyazawa, who was then  prime minister, and President Clinton. During the days of a  one-party rule by the Liberal Democratic Party, Japan often took  advantage of outside pressure to carry out domestic reform.  With the birth of the Hosokawa administration, Japan is pressed  with reexamining this past political approach.    There is no denying the fact that Japanese markets are  extremely attractive since Japan is a member of Asia which is  showing spectacular growth in the post-Cold War era. More than  a few European and U.S. firms which have already enjoyed success  in Japanese markets.    In view of an age when markets and consumers should decide  who is the winner, we should all level-headedly think once again  of ways to correct trade imbalances.</p>

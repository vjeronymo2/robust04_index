			<p><P> August 26, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 3 MORE SANTA ANA COUNCIL MEMBERS TARGETED FOR RECALL  </P> <P> A fundamentalist group will seek to recall six of the seven Santa Ana City  Council members for their refusal to sign a statement promising to ban a gay  pride festival next month at a local park.  </P> <P> Three of the council members, Mayor Daniel H. Young, Patricia A. McGuigan and  Daniel E. Griset, were given recall notices Monday night. Three others who did  not sign the resolution were not included in that action.  </P> <P> But on Friday, the Rev. Louis P. Sheldon, leader of the Anaheim-based Coalition  on Traditional Values, whose supporters are leading the recall campaign, said  the other three deserve equal treatment and that recall notices will be  delivered to them as well.  </P> <P> "This is a righteous call against the six of them," Sheldon said.  </P> <P> The second three are council members Ron May, Miguel A. Pulido and Richards L.  Norton.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Acosta Not Targeted  </P> <P> Only Councilman John Acosta signed the resolution. He is not being targeted for  the recall.  </P> <P> Pulido said Sheldon was simply playing politics. Pulido and May were told on  Monday that they were left out of the recall attempt because they will be up  for reelection in November, 1990.  </P> <P> "This has been a tough issue and the people of Santa Ana will know we did the  right thing," Pulido said Friday.  </P> <P> Sheldon said the council members can stop the recall action by signing the  first portion of his "pro-family" resolution, which states they support  heterosexual relationships rather than homosexual ones.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Eases Festival Stand  </P> <P> In a change of heart, Sheldon said the council members can even ignore the  bottom half of the resolution that calls for the banning of the Gay Pride  Festival, now scheduled for Sept. 9 and 10 at Centennial Regional Park.  </P> <P> "The point is that we want them to take a stand on the family and they refused  to," Sheldon said.  </P> <P> The group has to get 11,043 signatures for each of the recall targets. Sheldon  said he is convinced that his supporters will have no problems.  </P> <P> Norton was initially ignored by the group, thinking he was exempt from any  recall because he has only been in office since April.  </P> <P> "If this group, many of them outsiders, wants to recall me for upholding the  law, that's their right," Norton said in a written statement. "I have faith in  the intelligence of Santa Ana voters. They know that if we give in and break  the law this time, Mr. Sheldon or someone else will come back again and want us  to break some other law that they don't agree with."  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 4, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OTHER COMMENTARY / EXCERPTS;  </P> <P> TRUST NOT IN THE CONSTITUTION, BUT IN VOTES  </P> <P> Live by the sword, die by it. Pro-abortion forces who have lived by the Supreme  Court are now dying a death of a thousand cuts at the hands of the court.  </P> <P> Recent elections have been influenced by the provocation of pro-abortion groups  that energized an anti-abortion constituency.  </P> <P> It was provocative enough that pro-abortion forces used judicial fiat as a  scythe in 1973 to mow down the abortion laws of 50 states. They should have  practiced the patience of democracy, arguing their case in legislatures. There  they had been succeeding. Fourteen states with 41% of the population had  liberalized abortion laws before 1973. Since then, pro-abortion forces,  including some on the Supreme Court, have been imprudently provocative and  overreaching in rulings that have, for example, held that almost any parental  involvement in, or delaying of, an abortion decision is an unconstitutional  burden on the right.  </P> <P> On the other hand, the Republican Party has prospered by harnessing the small  but intense anti-abortion constituency. The GOP could get crushed if the 1973  ruling is overturned and the party finds itself committed, as it is today,  flatly against a right -- fairly free access to early abortions -- that a  substantial majority of Americans endorse.  </P> <P> By turning up the temperature in the abortion argument, Monday's decision makes  trouble for George Bush, who deserves it. His smarmy pandering to the passions  of the moment regarding flag-burning -- a constitutional amendment to stop what  hardly ever happens -- will cause the right-to-life movement to clamor for  similar exhibitionism on behalf of its amendment. It leaders will tell the  First Opportunist that there are few flag-burnings a year but thousands of  abortions every day.  </P> <P> Let us hope the Supreme Court soon drives out of the intellectual cul-de-sac it  took a wrong turn into in 1973. It should restore to the states the right to  regulate abortions. Let's have a 50-state row over this, remembering (it seems  to slip some judicial minds) that democracy is as American as French toast and  English muffins.  </P></p>

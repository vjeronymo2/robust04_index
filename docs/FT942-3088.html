			<p>940616 FT  16 JUN 94 / We're trying to connect you . . .: A look at the attractions of Sprint to French and German state-owned telecoms companies She's the quintessential savvy, beautiful, independent, professional American woman. That is the role actress Candice Bergen plays almost nightly on US television in two different contexts: as the star of the comedy series Murphy Brown and as advertising pitch-person for long-distance telecommunications group Sprint. Right now she can be seen extolling the merits of Sprint's new voice-activated Foncard - the world's first calling card allowing a user to dial numbers simply by ordering the telephone system to 'call home', or any of nine other destinations the individual nominates. One advertisement has Bergen losing her address book as she drives across a wild American landscape. No problem. She uses her Foncard at a remote call-box, muttering to herself: 'Is this a great country, or what?' The mundane act of placing a phone call seems sexy, sophisticated, even patriotic. It also highlights the attractions of Sprint, in which Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom have just agreed to invest some Dollars 4bn for a 20 per cent stake as part of a new global telecommunications alliance. Established in 1986, two years after AT&amp;T's stranglehold on the long-distance market was broken by an anti-trust court settlement, Sprint has built itself into one of the Big Three US long-distance carriers, with a strong brand identity (thanks in no small measure to Ms Bergen) and a reputation for technological innovation. It was the first US company to build a nationwide, all-digital fibre-optic network - the kind of system which will form the backbone of the much-touted 'information super-highway' - and it owns one of the leading global data communications networks, called SprintNet. That said, it has been less successful than rival MCI Communications - longer established and known for razor sharp marketing - at snatching customers from AT&amp;T, whose share of the US long-distance revenues has shrunk from 90 per cent to about 60 per cent since full competition was introduced in 1984. Sprint, which made some serious marketing errors in the late 1980s, has a US long-distance share of around 9.5 per cent, against roughly 19 per cent for MCI. But Sprint - dismissed a few years ago as a long-distance also-ran - is showing signs of being a more aggressive, effective competitor. It is also unique among US communications companies in having large operations in all three important areas of the business - long-distance, local and cellular telephony - and some analysts think this, with its national brand-name, puts it in a strong position to benefit from the sweeping change facing the US industry. But it is mainly Sprint's long-distance and international operations which make it the most attractive US partner for European telecommunications companies - given MCI's alliance last year with British Telecom, and the likelihood that AT&amp;T's size would make it an uncomfortable bedfellow and might trigger competition policy alarms in Brussels. Sprint, for its part, needs foreign allies if it is to be an effective global player against AT&amp;T and MCI, offering business customers a comprehensive service around the world. The Dollars 4bn it will receive from the French and Germans will help it cut borrowings (its debt to total capitalisation ratio stood at a relatively high 55 per cent in late 1993) and to invest in opportunities created by telecommunications liberalisation in the US and internationally. Central to Sprint's growth has been the personality of its tough chairman, 54-year-old Mr William Esrey. A former Harvard Business School student and one-time investment banker, in 1980 he joined United Telecoms, a sleepy local telephone operator, and persuaded it to invest in the long-distance market. In 1986, he united these operations with Sprint, the newly established long-distance arm of GTE, another local operator. GTE eventually sold its stake to United Telecom, which in turn changed its name to Sprint. Sprint's long-distance business quickly gained customers from AT&amp;T but at the start of the 1990s its market share began to slip, as the strains of its helter-skelter expansion began to tell: it was over-staffed; it had a reputation for billing errors; United Telecom and GTE argued over strategy; and MCI was much more innovative in its marketing, particularly to homes and small businesses. Sprint's share is now rising slowly again, and profitability is improving, thanks in part to a 1991 management reorganisation which focused more closely on market segments. It has established a solid position among corporate customers and has cleverly targeted affluent individuals who use the phone often, though it is still under-represented in the small businesses market. The long-distance arm is in the throes of an extensive programme to cut costs and improve cycle times which analysts expect to produce several hundred million dollars in savings when it ends next year. Its operating margin - operating income as a percentage of revenues - has already risen from 5 per cent in 1992 to a little over 8 per cent, and Wall Street expects the figure to be close to 10 per cent by late 1995. But that would still be short of the 11 to 12 per cent margin at AT&amp;T and MCI. Sprint's local telephone operations have a much better financial track record. Serving 6m customers in 19 states, Sprint has one of the most modern local networks in the US, one of the highest returns on equity among regional carriers and the nation's fastest growth in access lines. And while the local operations had operating revenues last year of Dollars 4.1bn, well below the Dollars 6.1bn of long-distance, they made Dollars 954m in operating income, far outstripping the Dollars 501m of long-distance. Sprint's cellular telephone business, the 10th largest in America, also had one of the industry's fastest rates of customer growth, and Mr Esrey plans to use much of the European cash injection to bolster its position. He wants to form an alliance with other cellular operators, which have a patchwork of local licences across the US, to create a seamless national mobile network. His rivals have similar plans: AT&amp;T (through its proposed takeover of McCaw Cellular) and MCI (through a stake in wireless operator Nextel). All three groups, and their allies, are expected to be keen bidders at the end of this year when the federal government auctions off licences for personal communications services, which use especially small, light handsets and may turn wireless into a mass market. Sprint's local phone business will face increased competition over the next three to five years, in common with every other regional carrier, as competition breaks down these local monopolies. But analysts think it will suffer less than most regional carriers because its local business is concentrated mainly in rural areas with fewer than 10,000 access lines - making this side of its business unattractive to companies targeting areas of high population density. Sprint, moreover, thinks any local losses it may suffer from competition could be greatly outweighed by the freedom deregulation will give it to go into the territory of other regional operators: many of its exchanges are close to large centres of population, where it could cream off business customers. 'This may be the gold mine of local competition for us,' says a senior executive.</p>

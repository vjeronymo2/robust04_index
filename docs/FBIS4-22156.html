			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Candidate of Historical Sciences Nikolay </F> Yevsenkin under the rubric "At the Crossroads of Trade":  "`Eldorado' in Asia"]    [Text] The nations of Southeast Asia, the Pacific  Rim, are called the new "Golden Eldorado" today. Traveling  businessmen of all the world's military companies of any  significance are frequent visitors to government offices and  headquarters at the very highest levels located in the capitals  of the Asian states. These are the nations which are  increasingly becoming the managers and organizers of prestigious  military exhibits and shows. What the world press refers to as  the "next great arms race" is being played out there.    According to many Western experts, the market in weapons of  the Pacific Rim is becoming the most promising. Its potential  economic volume reaches the astronomical amount of 100 billion  dollars.    In order to understand the next (this time "Asian") miracle,  one has to turn to both foreign and domestic factors. The former  group embraces the process of forced economic growth of the  Pacific Rim countries. Suffice it to say that in recent decades  the combined gross national product (GNP) of China and Japan,  and the so-called "little tigers -- Indonesia, Malaysia,  Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand, newly  industrialized countries (NIC) -- has grown by 160 percent,  reaching 4 trillion dollars. The military budget of the vast  majority of Asian nations is growing annually, most of which  goes for the purchase of weapons abroad.    The foreign factors are interregional conflicts pertaining  to  the unresolved status of territorial disputes, the struggle for  leadership in the region (the traditional rivalry between China  and Japan, for example). All of this creates a qualitatively new  situation in the world market of military exports, where a very  fierce battle is underway for dominance of the gold-generating  Asian niche -- the absolute leader is the USA, with Western  Europe and Russia attempting not to fall behind.    The entire belt of Pacific Rim countries can be  hypothetically broken down into three subgroups with certain  common patterns of development of their armed forces and  military imports. The first includes the countries in the  northern part of the region -- China, Japan, Taiwan and the two  Koreas -- which have a developed military industrial base and  diversified military trade ties.    The most impressive is China's project for establishing an  airborne assault grouping in the South China Sea, which would  permit Beijing to establish domination in the body of water of  the "inner China Sea." According to experts, this would cost  China 4-6 billion dollars. A component of this plan is the  purchase of supersonic Tu-22M bombers from Russia.    Japan's military budget reached 34 billion dollars this  year.  The American military-industrial complex, the strategic rival in  the region and main supplier for Tokyo, is in strategic  competition with Continental China. This is how one Japanese  diplomat puts it: "If China actually purchases an aircraft  carrier, we shall have to reconsider the strategy of the entire  region."    The second group of countries (which, incidentally, actively  import foreign weapons) includes the states of the southern part  of Southeast Asia: Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,  Singapore and Thailand. At the end of the 1980's the leaders of  most of these countries adopted large-scale programs for  modernizing their armed forces. The government of the  Philippines, for example, approved a 10-year plan for the  development of its army at an estimated cost of five billion  dollars.    Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have set  themselves the task of establishing a "deep-water" navy by the  end of the century; that is, forces capable of conducting  operations in the open ocean, not just in coastal waters. Within  the framework of these programs purchases of surface ships are  being planned and implemented, their own rapid-deployment forces  are being formed, formations of long-range fighter bombers are  being formed capable of supporting the operations of naval task  forces.    It should be mentioned that the fiercest competition for  weapons sales among the exporting nations is developing  precisely in these countries today. Washington is the  unquestionable leader, but Russia also has a fairly good chance.  According to the LOS ANGELES TIMES, Russia has something to take  to this market. And the importing countries are taking the  initiative. In June 1993 Malaysia's leadership announced its  intention to purchase 18 MIG-29 aircraft. Thailand's military  leadership is considering the purchase of transport helicopters.    The third group of countries includes the nations of  post-communist Indochina. Due to their economic difficulties the  leaders of these countries are a long way from buying modern  armaments at the present time. Nonetheless, one should not  forget that the 700,000-man Vietnamese army is outfitted mostly  with our equipment and weapons.    The Soviet naval base established in 1978 at the port of  Kamrahn is an advantageous project for Hanoi today. It could  become a stable source of foreign currency. Russia is the most  likely competitor here, since in July 1992 Vietnam's leadership  expressed its agreement with Moscow's intention to retain this  naval base.    And so, a boom in military purchases in the Pacific Rim  countries is in the offing. Overall outlays on military imports  have increased there from 2.5 billion (1979-1981) to 4.6 billion  (1987-1989) dollars, an increase of 84 percent. Russia's  military-industrial complex, which has some indisputable aces to  play (including comparatively low prices, as well as the  possibility of barter agreements) has a perfectly realistic  chance for the future development of this market.</p>

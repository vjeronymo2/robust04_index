			<p><P> October 18, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KJOI TO DROP EASY-LISTENING FORMAT SUNDAY;  </P> <P> RADIO: THE STATION WILL REPLACE INSTRUMENTALS WITH SOFT VOCALS AND LIGHT JAZZ  IN AN EFFORT TO ATTRACT YOUNGER LISTENERS.  </P> <P> In an unusual move for a successful radio station, KJOI-FM (98.7) said Tuesday  it will abandon the "easy listening" instrumental format it has employed for  the last 25 years in favor of soft vocals and light jazz.  </P> <P> The switch, effective Sunday, comes as a surprise because KJOI ranks fifth  among Southern California's most-listened-to radio stations in the latest  Arbitron ratings and, according to Bob Griffith, KJOI vice president and  general manager, enjoys a 23% increase in advertising revenue this year over  the same period in 1988.  </P> <P> The change from the station's traditional "elevator music" format was prompted  by KJOI's lack of audience growth and a desire among station officials to reach  slightly younger listeners.  </P> <P> "We were not unhappy with our ratings," Griffith said. "We found that most of  the research indicated that the radio station was not growing. . . . And our  competition, for the most part, is growing by leaps and bounds. If everyone  else is growing and you're not, you're perceived to be losing."  </P> <P> After eight months of surveys, station officials said, they determined that the  desired target audience (between ages 35 and 54) would best be reached through  an updated format. Currently, the average listener is over 45, Griffith said.  </P> <P> Attracting younger listeners is mandatory if KJOI is "to compete in the '90s,"  said operations manager Allan Hotlen.  </P> <P> "The term 'elevator music' is perceived as a negative," Griffith said. "And  KJOI is synonymous with elevator music. That's why we felt we have to  re-package."  </P> <P> The mix will be 75% soft vocals -- by artists such as Anita Baker, Don Henley,  Carly Simon, Al Jarreau and Neil Diamond -- and 25% instrumental light jazz, by  such musicians as David Sanborn, David Benoit and Kenny G. KJOI executives said  85% of the music will be compositions recorded in the last 10 years.  </P> <P> "We still would like to be the softest radio station on the dial . . . but what  we'd like to do is update the programming," Griffith said. "We think of it as  an opportunity to keep our current listeners and also attract new listeners."  </P> <P> The station will keep its call letters, though downplaying them in favor of the  identifying slogan, "Touch 98.7."  </P> <P> Terms such as passion, affection, bonding and emotion were bandied about by  KJOI officials at a news conference announcing the change Tuesday.  </P> <P> "We think 'Touch' reflects the emotionalism and realness that maybe people  don't find available on radio of today," Hotlen said. "We think our success  will be a function largely of how people bond with the radio station."  </P> <P> Television advertisements will feature soft, sultry songs and couples nuzzling  or children smiling and the slogan, "Music you can really feel."  </P> <P> The station will not feature flashy on-air personalities, nor will it offer  big-money giveaways, officials said.  </P> <P> Rich Capparela, the mellifluous-voiced former KFAC-FM announcer who was briefly  at KUSC-FM after KFAC changed formats Sept. 21, will move over to KJOI next  week.  </P> <P> With rock stations jockeying for position to corner the coveted teen audience,  an opportunity to reach more middle-aged people has opened up, Griffith said.  </P> <P> "What has happened to L.A. is that as a lot of radio stations become more  rock-based, they're deserting an area that is very advantageous: adults about  40," Griffith said.  </P> <P> The station is expected to compete with KOST-FM (103.5), currently the No. 1  station in the market, and KBIG-FM (104.3), which ranked No. 8 in the latest  Arbitron survey.  </P> <P> Both KOST and KBIG also made the switch from easy listening during the '80s.  </P></p>

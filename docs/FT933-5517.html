			<p>930903 FT  03 SEP 93 / German recovery plan urges return to traditional values CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl will today appeal for popular support for government plans to protect Germany's future prosperity through a return to the more diligent values and attitudes which helped the country recover after the second world war. Proposals for privatisation, de-regulation and reform of the costly social security system are the main features of a 96-page discussion document, approved by the coalition cabinet yesterday. 'The virtues of public-spiritedness, solidarity and acceptance of technical progress appear not to have the importance they once had in German thinking,' it says. Germans 'have lost their readiness to accept change and renewal. The postwar generation did not concentrate only on their rights but also on their responsibilities'. The paper, prepared by the economics ministry, calls for a shake-out of virtually all the country's economic and social institutions. It identifies weaknesses in the education system, an overstaffed civil service, and rigid pay and conditions structures which bar the unemployed from returning to work. It also calls for an end to over-restrictive planning controls on industrial plant construction and for reform of laws limiting shop-opening hours. Mr Kohl will endorse the programme at a press conference in Bonn today. The widely leaked document, 'Securing the future of Germany's economic base', was attacked by the Social Democrat opposition as a declaration of the bankruptcy of the government's economic policy. The OTV public services union said whoever followed its recommendations was heading for a 'fiasco'. 'Yesterday's recipes' were no help in mastering Germany's current problems, said the DAG white-collar union. The paper is the government's latest attempt to get to grips with the structural weaknesses exposed first by unification with the former East Germany and latterly by the onset of recession. This year federal, state and local government spending is expected to account for 52 per cent of gross domestic product, compared with 48 per cent before unification. Proposals include the targeting of social benefits on those most in need, tenancy law reforms to encourage private investment in housing, and a shortening of time at school from 13 to 12 years. Subsidies to fading industries such as coal mining should be progressively reduced or stopped five years from now. The state should also withdraw from services where the private sector can perform better: transport, water, power, rubbish collection and housing.

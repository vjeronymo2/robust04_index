			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Support levels regained in spite of late setback : Market report The London stock market struggled hard yesterday to hold on to its nearest support levels as confidence was challenged by a renewed sell-off in European government bond markets after the strike talks at IG Metall, the German steel group, took an aggressive turn. The FT-SE 100 Index closed 32.3 down at 3,350.3, having dipped through the support level to touch 3,347.9 as both stock index futures and UK gilts fell sharply in late dealings. Trading in the London market was inhibited by the public holiday closure of Wall Street yesterday and by uncertainty ahead of today's testimony to Congress by Mr Alan Greenspan, head of the Federal Reserve Board, when he is expected to spell out his views on inflationary pressures on the US economy. UK stocks opened lower but the initial fall of nearly 30 points on the FT-SE 100, leaving the 3,350 level secure for the moment, was reduced to 12 points when the March future on the index rallied from its early loss. With the big institutions unwilling to sell stock until Wall Street returns to normal trading, probably tomorrow, share prices steadied and the market traded calmly in modest turnover for most of the session. Once again, the setback in equities reflected a withdrawal of buyers rather than an increase in selling pressure. The shock came very late in the day, when the March contract on the Footsie dropped to around 3,330, a significant discount against the stock market, as the IG Metall news provoked renewed selling of bonds in Germany and the UK. The fall was prompted by an extension of earlier losses in British government bonds which left longer dated issues with falls ranging to around  3/4 of a point. The FT-SE 100 Index last traded below 3,350 on December 21, so any further slide from last night's close will finally wipe out the gains scored in the surge in the index at the beginning of this year. Interest rate prospects have been the principal factor in the market. Traders stressed that uncertainty, rather than bearishness, was the keynote of the day. This week also offers a heavy list of trading statements from leading British companies, with Unilever and SmithKline Beecham leading the way today, and ICI and British Aerospace following later in the week. Hopes that British base rates can still be reduced soon in spite of the latest rise in rates across the Atlantic were shaken by the renewed selling in European bond markets yesterday. 'A steadier trend in bond prices is a prerequisite for any recovery in share prices,' was the blunt comment from one leading dealer. Although the general uncertainty spread across equities yesterday, bringing a fall of 41.6 points in the FT-SE Mid 250 Index to a closing level of 3,983.9, trading volumes indicated no overall threat at present to market confidence. Seaq volume dipped to 506.1m shares from Friday's 630.9m. Daily value of retail, or customer, business in equities, which has been falling away over the past week, stood at only Pounds 1.3bn on Friday, well below the levels of a fortnight ago, albeit still a satisfactorily profitable level for the London-based securities industry. Investors remain convinced that the UK authorities will be able to trim domestic base rates again shortly and hope that France will set the lead to lower rates in the near future.</p>

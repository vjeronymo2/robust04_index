In a statement issued on Monday, the movement leaders urged  the State Duma deputies to adopt an amendment to their decision  on amnesty to limit the right of those pardoned to conduct  political activity and be elected to posts in state bodies of  power until the new presidential and parliamentary elections are  held in the country.    The movement also called on all Russian parties and public  organisations seeking to lessen political tension in society to  urgently get down to work to set up a popular coalition of  reform, which is the only means of saving Russia, as the  statement said.    However, Valentin Kovalev, deputy chairman of the State  Duma,  stressed earlier today that under international agreements of  which Russia is a party, it has no right to limit political  rights of people who have been released by amnesty. "Therefore I  believe that people released in connection with the act of  political amnesty cannot be limited in their political rights.  Otherwise it would contradict the norms of international law,"  he said.    He said that State Duma faction leaders suggested adopting a  special act stripping those pardoned of what they have received  under amnesty if they continue to destabilise the situation in  the country. However, such a document would need clear-cut  juridical specifications rather than political interpretations,  primarily of the term "destabilisation," Kovalev said.</p>

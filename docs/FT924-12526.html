			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / BAe small shareholders stage revolt BRITISH Aerospace yesterday faced a protest from its small shareholders who refused to approve a special resolution to reduce the company's capital as part of its financial and industrial restructuring announced last month. Although the capital reduction was finally approved by 99.75 per cent, small shareholders forced the company to call a poll after BAe failed to win the necessary majority from the 200 shareholders at yesterday's extraordinary general meeting. The meeting was supposed to rubber-stamp the capital reduction to enable BAe to pay a 3p interim dividend following its Pounds 750m restructuring write-offs. But it lasted more than two hours as small shareholders grilled Mr John Cahill, BAe's chairman, over the restructuring and forced a poll. One City of London analyst said the reaction of small shareholders was not surprising. 'Too much is going on at BAe for small shareholders to understand; the City itself had trouble understanding the latest restructuring package,' he said. He was referring to the collapse of BAe's share price after the company announced last month a first-half pre-tax loss of Pounds 129m, a Pounds 750m write-off, a proposal to produce regional jets jointly with Taiwan, the closure of the historic Hatfield manufacturing plant and a capital reduction involving cutting the nominal value of ordinary shares from 50p to 10p. One shareholder told Mr Cahill: 'The only thing that is extraordinary about the meeting is that losses of this magnitude are allowed to occur.' Shareholders questioned the proposed venture with Taiwan and asked whether other problems were expected 'to crawl out of the woodwork'. Mr Cahill defended the company's restructuring and recovery strategy. Provided forecasts were maintained, he said BAe was expected to operate profitably in the second half of this year now that it had capped the losses of its 146 regional jet business. Regional jets had been the 'single most important factor in the company's financial underperformance', he said. Mr Cahill added progress had been 'good' in the negotiations with Taiwan Aerospace. BAe hopes to complete the Taiwan deal by the end of the year. Company officials also said the company remained confident over its long-term relationship with Saudi Arabia.</p>

			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / UK leads in European cross-border takeovers BRITAIN has jumped six places to first position in the European cross-border takeover league, with UK companies completing more acquisitions in Europe than their counterparts in any other country during the first nine months of the year. At the same time the rate of cross-border activity in Europe has declined in the first three quarters, reflecting deepening economic difficulties in many countries. Foreign acquisitions by German companies are expected to fall by as much as 50 per cent this year. A survey by cross-border mergers and acquisitions specialist, Translink, shows British companies completed 160 deals in the first three quarters, against 158 for all of last year. So far, 810 cross-border deals have been completed by companies in Europe. Translink estimates that some 1,100 will be completed this year, a decline of 20 per cent. The company said yesterday Britain's aggressive cross-border activity appeared to confirm its emergence from recession. 'It seems we are slightly ahead in the economic cycle,' Translink said. The US, last year's leader with a total of 215 deals for 1992, fell to second place with 156 acquisitions for the nine months. France holds third place with 121 deals, compared with 202 for all of 1992. Britain also remains the most popular target, with foreign groups snapping up 150 companies so far, against 196 in 1992.</p>

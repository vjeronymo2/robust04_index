			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Trying to head off a Brazilian breakaway: Christina Lamb visits angry southern separatists THE flag of Brazil's southernmost state is inscribed with the name Republic of the Rio Grande, recalling long ago days of independence. Proudly displayed in the offices of the state's leading businessmen and government officials, it symbolises a growing irritation with the distortion by which the richer and more populous south of Brazil subsidises the poorer north and north-east, yet receives less political representation. This resentment is about to take shape as the government of Rio Grande do Sul state puts the final touches to a court action challenging Brazil's federal structure, demanding greater political representation for the south to avert the spread of separatism. Mr Sergio Porto, a lawyer and cabinet chief of the Rio Grande do Sul government, explains: 'The extreme bias of political representation towards the north and north-east completely contradicts the constitutional principles of equality and proportional democracy'. The south and south-east are the richest parts of Brazil, accounting for 75.9 per cent of national GDP and 85m of the total 146m population, yet they are outweighed politically by the centre, north and north-east, which provide just 17.9 per cent of GDP. This is a result of the creation of less-populated northern states by the military regime of 1964-85 and of a constitution which gives each state, no matter its size, a minimum of eight members in the House of Representatives in the federal Congress. Southerners frequently comment, half in jest, that Brazil would be a very rich country if it lopped off everything north of Rio de Janeiro. This sentiment is more serious among the 9.2m people of Rio Grande do Sul, which still commemorates its independence of 1835-45. Without prompting, local businessmen talk bitterly about subsidising 'indolent north-easterners' who 'damage Brazil's image.' Their wrath is understandable. Rio Grande do Sul seems like another country compared with the hungry north-east. The state, one of the richest regions in Latin America, boasts social indicators worthy of the developed world, with average life expectancy of 72 years and 89 per cent literacy. Some 81.3 per cent of households have telephones. Porto Alegre, the state capital, with its modern architecture and tree-lined roads, could fit easily into Europe. Telephones work, appointments are kept on time and cars stop at traffic lights and zebra crossings. Such is the growing mood towards separatism in the region that four movements have sprung up. Mr Irton Marx, president of the Pampa Movement, says: 'Separatism is the only way for Brazil to shake off its backwardness'. The movement recently started a state-wide TV campaign: 'Enough of being ashamed abroad by being thought swindlers, underdeveloped and primitive'. Mr Marx claims to have 780,000 signatures already for his proposed referendum on separation of the three southernmost states - Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina and Parana. Southern feelings run particularly high at present because of the fiscal reform under discussion in Congress. Rio Grande do Sul is one of the highest contributors to federal revenues, but is a low recipient thereof and wants to stop its subsidising of the north. Mr Alceu Collares, state governor, complains: 'We send 15.5 per cent of state GDP to Braslia and only get back the equivalent of 9 per cent. If this, and the political discrimination, is not altered we could face an unstoppable separatist campaign.'</p>

			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Badge of quality - Charles Batchelor assesses whether BS5750 is too complex and costly for small companies Geoff Smith could be the man to give quality a good name among smaller companies in Britain. Smith, managing director of Alfred Bagnall &amp; Sons (South Wales), a painting contractor, earlier this month achieved accreditation for his company under British Standard 5750. BS5750 is a quality standard which helps businesses adapt their management procedures to reduce the chances of mistakes being made and to allow errors which do occur to be traced and rectified. It is being adopted by a growing number of British companies and other organisations as diverse as local chambers of commerce and (in a modified form) by Notting Hill police station in west London. What was unusual about Smith's approach to BS5750 was that he made no use of outside consultants to help in the lengthy and often complex qualification procedure. After an initial approach to the British Standards Institution (BSI), the main standards body for BS5750, Smith and his finance director worked through the BSI handbooks and implemented the scheme themselves. 'When we went back to BSI they said we must come on an introductory course,' Smith recalls. 'We told them we had already written a quality manual and introduced all the procedures and that we wanted accreditation. They only half believed us but when they got here and saw what we had done, they said we had done a splendid job.' Smith and his company seem set for a star role in promotional brochures put out by BSI and the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI). For after initial enthusiasm for the idea of quality standards, BS5750 has run into increasing criticism from smaller companies. BS5750 has been criticised for being unduly complex and for imposing a heavy burden on the smaller firm. It demands hundreds of hours of management time, is costly and is not intended to improve the quality of a company's products or services directly but only to improve the management process. 'The standard is written in mumbo jumbo,' says Bernard Juby of the Federation of Small Businesses, which has been campaigning for it to be made more comprehensible to small firms. 'Companies have to take on consultants who regurgitate large chunks from the manuals and then charge an arm and a leg.' These claims were backed up earlier this month with the publication of an Open University survey which showed that many small firms feared BS5750 would push up their costs without improving the quality of the goods or services provided. While 2.5 per cent had already obtained BS5750 and a further 25 per cent were in the process or intended to register, just over half said it was not for them. But what has particularly angered many small businesses is that they may have no choice but to register if they want to retain their customers. Large firms and government organisations increasingly expect their suppliers to meet the standard. Geoff Smith is convinced of the value of BS5750 despite the fact that it took nearly one day's work a week for him and his finance director over two years. The standard provides an external measure of the effectiveness of his management controls, has increased efficiency and, in the past four months, has improved profits by 10 per cent, he calculates. Procedures for handling and placing orders have been formalised so as to eliminate the small mistakes which took up so much management time. 'There is paperwork involved but it cuts out the 2 per cent of the jobs which caused 90 per cent of the problems,' he says. Alfred Bagnall (South Wales) has already started to benefit from BS5750 but with turnover of Pounds 1.3m and a workforce of 45 it is rather larger than the very small businesses - employing up to 20 people - which are the main cause of concern for the Federation of Small Businesses. (Bagnall is also part of a larger Yorkshire-based company, but it received no help from head office.) The experiences of a small engineering company with sales of Pounds 250,000 and eight employees are more typical, according to the critics of BS5750. This company, which prefers to remain anonymous, is currently half-way through the accreditation process but is an unwilling convert to BS5750 under pressure from customers. The managing director says he has had to change many of his procedures radically and the cost, he believes, can only be met by reducing the quality of the products he supplies. The only way of continuing deliveries to some of his customers has been to supply them through another company which is already registered for BS5750, though this has reduced his company's margins. This company has paid an external consultant Pounds 350 a day for 15 days (though the government's Enterprise Initiative scheme meets half of the consultant's fees) to help it produce a quality manual, but the managing director believes he will need an extra employee to handle the paperwork. 'We have always worked to a high standard so the only benefit I can see is that we will retrieve some of the customers we have lost,' he says. The BSI remains convinced of the value of BS5750 for businesses of all sizes. It points to the 20,000 UK companies which have achieved accreditation and to the growing acceptance of the standard, or its international equivalents ISO9000 and EN29000, in continental Europe, the US and Japan. 'In general, companies find they are already doing 80 per cent of what is needed to meet the standard,' comments Tom Harland, director of business development at BSI Quality Assurance. Although the standard does not directly set out to improve the quality of products or service, by installing procedures which allow a company to identify what has gone wrong, it has the effect of improving product quality, he says. BSI and other UK certification organisations have, however, been forced by a growing wave of protest from small businesses to consider ways of making BS5750 simpler to implement. The Federation of Small Businesses initially pushed for a less demanding standard for small firms but, realising this would lead to small businesses being labelled as 'second class', is now pushing for simplified manuals and easier implementation procedures. 'We have been looking at a more appropriate method of applying the system,' comments Bernard Juby. 'We would like to devise a manual which would allow a small business to take a step-by-step approach to implementing BS5750. It should be possible to do that for under Pounds 50.' As more large companies start to apply BS5750, it has become increasingly important to devise a means to allow the 96 per cent of UK businesses which employ fewer than 20 people to share the benefits of higher quality standards.</p>

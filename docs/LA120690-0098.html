			<p><P> December 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANALYSTS DOUBT IOWANS' PLAN FOR $1.5-BILLION PAN AM BID  </P> <P> Airline analysts were skeptical Wednesday about plans by an Iowa group to raise  $1.5 billion to buy Pan American World Airways and move its headquarters to  northeast Iowa.  </P> <P> "I'd give this a long shot at occurring," said Robert Decker, an analyst for  Duff &amp; Phelps Inc. in Chicago.  </P> <P> He said it would be nearly impossible to raise the money needed for the buyout,  especially in light of Pan Am's tottering finances.  </P> <P> A Waterloo, Iowa-based investment group proposes to sell at least 300,000 bonds  in $5,000 denominations to buy Pan Am, according to Pan Am airline Capt. Neil  Sapp, 51, of Miami.

"We're not crazy;  we're just innovative."  </P> <P> Sapp and Samual Nodarse of Cedar Falls, Iowa, a retired University of Northern  Iowa professor, formed the Iowa Acquisition Group and said they would buy the  company on condition that its headquarters move from New York to Waterloo.  </P> <P> He said money raised through the sale of bonds would be invested with Iowa  banks, primarily in certificates of deposit, with the interest used to pay off  loans from investment bankers. Investors would get interest when bonds mature  in nine years.  </P> <P> Officials at Pan Am's headquarters in New York did not immediately return phone  calls for comment. But industry analysts disagreed with Sapp's prediction.  </P> <P> "In today's market, it would be difficult to raise that kind of money for an  airline like Pan Am," Decker.

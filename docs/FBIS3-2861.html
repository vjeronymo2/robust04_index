Ruan, who is here attending the annual session of the  National People's Congress, said that the Hainan Provincial  authorities have asked local government leaders to devote more  efforts and time to improving their duties of managing social  affairs, in a bid to promote the creation of a market economy.    The island province of Hainan is also China's largest  special  economic zone, where special and flexible policies are being  pursued to encourage investors from Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan and  overseas.    "Under the conditions of a market economy, manufacturers  should be able to decide on their production according to market  demand," the governor said.    Therefore, government departments must always follow this  basic law of the market economy and should never interfere in  normal commodity production and exchanges, he noted.    "We have taken a series of major measures to reduce  government interference since the beginning of last year," he  said.    For example, all check posts on roads in Hainan were removed  last year, thus facilitating the free movement of commodities  provincewide.    Moreover, all government-assigned tax supervisors in  enterprises were recalled in 1993.    According to Ruan Chongwu, the government is duty-bound to  create a fine environment for the effective operation of  commodity markets, labor markets and production factor markets.    "Of course, market forces are not all-powerful," he said,  "so  the government must exercise necessary intervention in economic  affairs."    The government must perform its duty of arousing the  initiative of all sectors of society, and must coordinate and  balance the interests among various sectors so as to protect the  interests of society, he said.    Under a market economy, he said, the government must  undertake major projects that are beneficial to the whole  society but have low economic returns.    These include water conservancy facilities, schools,  hospitals and environmental protection facilities.    Furthermore, the government is duty-bound to effectively  manage unrenewable resources, particularly land.    It must also exercise macro-economic controls by drawing up  construction plans, releasing information and formulating  industrial, fiscal and financial policies, he said.</p>

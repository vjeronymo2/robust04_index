			<p><P> August 20, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DRIVERS SEEKING SHORTCUTS RAISE HACKLES IN SUBURBIA;  </P> <P> TRAFFIC: HOMEOWNERS ARE BEING PITTED AGAINST COMMUTERS SPILLING OVER INTO  RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOODS. ;  </P> <P> REGIONAL REPORT TRAFFIC  </P> <P> When Gene Brull moved to Robinson Street, it was a quiet lane on a Redondo  Beach hill. Then one day, commuters discovered it made a fine shortcut to the  San Diego Freeway and local office parks.  </P> <P> Suddenly, Brull couldn't back out of his driveway for fear of being broadsided  by rush-hour road hogs. Children stopped riding bikes on the street. People  started keeping pets indoors.  </P> <P> So the aerospace engineer and father of three persuaded the city to make  Robinson one-way. Now he wishes his life could be half as peaceful as his  street. Brull's neighbors a block over are up in arms because the roaring  short-cutters now cut past their homes. And for a while, he was even getting  hate mail, computer-typed messages exhorting him to leave the neighborhood "or  risk your health."  </P> <P> Brull's is a tale from the front of what traffic engineers and city planners  say is an escalating battle in car-clogged Southern California. As freeways and  major surface streets reach capacity, more and more traffic is spilling into  suburban neighborhoods -- pitting commuter against homeowner and block against  block.  </P> <P> From the rural byways of Malibu to Santa Ana's city core, from the broad  boulevards of the San Gabriel Valley to the teeming Fairfax District of Los  Angeles, freeway gridlock is leading more and more commuters on a quest for new  and faster detours, traffic officials say. There are half again as many cars  crammed onto the state's freeways today as there were 10 years ago, and the  average 10-mile workday commute now takes 30 to 40 minutes -- 10 to 15 minutes  longer than it took just two years ago.  </P> <P> But the situation also has led residents and local governments to rise up with  a host of obstacles aimed at forcing short-cutters to shortcut someplace else.  </P> <P> In Pasadena, for example, the demand last year for speed humps to slow down  short-cutters on residential streets ran so high that the city ended up paying  triple what it had budgeted for such impediments and had to suspend its  speed-hump program. In Orange County, spillover from the perpetually congested  "Orange Crush" -- the junction of the Santa Ana, Orange and Garden Grove  freeways -- has prompted a neighborhood in Orange to blockade its streets with  concrete barricades.  </P> <P> In the San Fernando Valley, the quandary over whether to extend Reseda  Boulevard to ease shortcut congestion in Encino has been so emotional that a  public hearing on the issue last year erupted into a fist-swinging brawl. In  Beverly Hills, city staffers have embarked on an endeavor known as the Livable  Streets program, aimed at protecting the neighborhoods south of Wilshire from  cut-through traffic out of Century City.  </P> <P> The list of shortcuts goes on and on, from the streets of Claremont offering  rush-hour relief from the San Bernardino Freeway to the overrun byways around  Dodger Stadium. The problem is so pernicious that traffic engineers have  assigned it an official name -- Commuter Infiltration -- and have accumulated  volumes of reports on how to rectify it:  </P> <P> Barricades. Stop signs. Speed bumps. Speed humps. Man-made curves built into  streets with big lumps of concrete known affectionately in the traffic trade as  "elephant droppings."  </P> <P> But still the problem remains.  </P> <P> "Traffic is like water," observed Maria Rychlicki, transportation planning  manager for Beverly Hills. "It'll go where it can find a way." Shortcutting  commuters have been a problem for decades in some parts of the country, said  Dan Smith Jr., an Oakland-based transportation consultant who has co-authored  two books on residential traffic management. In Michigan and New Jersey, for  example, some cities have been experimenting since the 1940s with devices  intended to divert traffic away from residential neighborhoods, he said.  </P> <P> "But there has been a lot more ferment in California in the last two decades,"  Smith said.  </P> <P> Part of the reason, he and others say, is simply that California has more cars.  A report released earlier this year by Californians for Better Transportation,  a highway lobbying group, found that traffic statewide has grown 55% in the  last 10 years to 241 billion vehicle-miles a year. In the same period, the  group reported, the miles of new road construction have increased less than 2%.  Moreover, two-thirds of existing roads were found to be in fair or poor  condition.  </P> <P> In newer suburbs, streets are arranged so it is all but impossible for  short-cutters to disrupt neighborhoods. Homes are built on cul-de-sacs that  feed into so-called "collector" streets that, in turn, flow into major routes  to and from office parks and freeways.  </P> <P> But streets are more vulnerable in older neighborhoods -- rural ones, for  example, and those built on the standard grid pattern of streets popular in the  post-World War II building boom. The crosshatch of streets in Gene Brull's  neighborhood in North Redondo Beach, for example, offered an uninterrupted  route to the massive office park dominated by TRW, one of the South Bay's  biggest employers.  </P> <P> The neighborhoods erected during a quieter era in the Fairfax District of Los  Angeles now abut the bustling Wilshire Corridor. And Malibu has in recent years  complained about "Z-pattern" short-cutters -- commuters from Ventura County and  northwestern Los Angeles County who avoid taking the Ventura Freeway into the  central business districts by taking a Z-shaped route, east to Malibu or  Topanga Canyon, south via the Pacific Coast Highway, then east again on the  Santa Monica Freeway.  </P> <P> But cars, Smith believes, are not the only reason cities are doing battle  against cut-through traffic.  </P> <P> "I think the California population, being new, tries to take more control of  their environment," he said.  </P> <P> Perhaps the best-known assault on "commuter infiltration" occurred in Berkeley  in the 1970s, when the city erected $618,000 worth of signs, lights, barriers  and other devices in an ambitious effort to keep cars on main arterials and  away from neighborhoods.  </P> <P> The endeavor cleared some residential streets, but left the city politically  polarized. Critics charged that the plan was anti-automobile paranoia. The  barriers had been in less than a year when a physician -- whose seven-minute  drive to the emergency room soared to 20 minutes because of the changes --  launched a ballot initiative for its repeal.  </P> <P> The initiative failed, and, despite the years of litigation that ensued, most  of the diverters installed by the city remain in place, said Dan Smith Jr., a  traffic consultant who worked on the original plan.  </P> <P> "Berkeley is still a tough drive in some places and not as bad in others,"  Smith said. But the Berkeley experience galvanized other California cities as  freeway congestion began to spill over into neighborhoods never intended as  thoroughfares.  </P> <P> "I think there's a lot more consciousness about the problem now than, say, 15  or 20 years ago," Smith said. "So even while traffic has grown a lot, people  are also a lot more willing to experiment."  </P> <P> Which isn't to say that the solutions to cut-through traffic have become any  less divisive.  </P> <P> "The technical issues aren't the tough ones," said Dave Barnhart, Pasadena's  city engineer. "It's the political consensus that's tough. We all want to live  on a nice, quiet cul-de-sac with an on-ramp running into our garage -- we want  to have privacy, but we also want to have access to the road."  </P> <P> The little neighborhood in the southwesternmost corner of Orange understands  the political problems only too well. Surrounded on two sides by development  and freeways and equipped with a street system dating in some spots to the  early 1900s, the little community once known as Pumpkinville found itself under  virtual assault from the automobile.  </P> <P> To the south was the massive MainPlace mall, one of Orange County's biggest  shopping centers; to the west was the junction of three freeways. The major  arteries were so notoriously jammed that the junction earned the nickname  "Orange Crush." It wasn't long before the little neighborhood was awash in  cars.  </P> <P> "Ten million square feet of office space and one of the busiest intersections  in Southern California," marveled Mike Spurgeon, chairman of the area's traffic  committee. "And guess where all those people were driving?"  </P> <P> Eventually, the city erected signs blocking access to the neighborhood's south  end, allowing drivers to get out but not in. The signs were so popular that,  this year, the City Council voted to replace them with concrete barricades.  </P> <P> But consensus didn't come easy.  </P> <P> "Some wanted all the streets open," Spurgeon said. "Some wanted everything  closed. It took 4 1/2 years for us to get anything done because these  neighborhood meetings turned into shouting matches."  </P> <P> Tom Conner, assistant general manager for the Los Angeles Transportation  Department, agreed that commuter infiltration "is a very emotional and touchy  issue."  </P> <P> Take, for example, the meeting last August called by Los Angeles City  Councilman Marvin Braude to talk about San Fernando Valley short-cutters.  </P> <P> Plagued by cut-through traffic from the San Diego Freeway, Encino residents  wanted to extend Reseda Boulevard to Mulholland Drive. The people of Tarzana  hated the idea.  </P> <P> The plan was to be debated on a Thursday night at an Encino elementary school.  But the meeting hall filled before everyone who wanted to speak got a seat.  Soon emotion superseded words. Outside, people began pounding on the windows  and doors, and teen-age boys scrambled onto the roof to post anti-extension  signs. The president of the Encino Property Owners Assn. got tackled in the  melee. A boy from Tarzana hurt his wrist.  </P> <P> "We get fingers pointed at us. We get called names," Conner said. "People say  we don't care, but we do. Our professional associations are constantly trying  to come up with solutions to the problem."  </P> <P> Pasadena has been particularly aggressive in its attempts to tackle cut-through  traffic -- or slow it down, at least. By summer's end, 85 streets will have  been equipped with 350 speed humps -- gently sloping mounds of asphalt about 3  inches tall -- so many that the city had to suspend the program because the  demand outstripped the budget for speed humps, Barnhart said.  </P> <P> Other cities have flooded neighborhoods with stop signs and no-left-turn  restrictions. Still others have built S-curves into straightaways with lumps of  concrete and made it harder to turn into beleaguered neighborhoods by narrowing  intersections with so-called traffic chokers.  </P> <P> In Beverly Hills, a citizens committee has been working with City Hall for the  last two years on a 20-point program to rid residential streets of the  downtown-bound Santa Monicans and the Valley-bound Brentwood commuters, traffic  planning manager Rychlicki said. Meanwhile, back on the blacktop, the commuters  continue to infiltrate.  </P> <P> Last year, in fact, two Los Angeles writers published a novelty book of  shortcuts through 90 of the city's most congested areas. Co-authors Brian  Roberts and Richard Schwadel earned brief notoriety after homeowners around  Lake Hollywood blamed the book for an onslaught of cross-town traffic.  </P> <P> But Roberts said the little book has sold more than 7,000 copies so far.  </P> <P> "People are frustrated out there. Everybody's looking for a better way,"  Roberts said. "If I have one more person call me asking for an Orange County  book, I'll scream."  </P></p>

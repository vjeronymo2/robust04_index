			<p>940411 FT  11 APR 94 / US attempts to unravel its mixed messages Clinton administration officials have spent the past week trying to clear up the diplomatic mess caused when Mr William Perry, the defence secretary, said forthrightly that the US was not about to intervene in Bosnia to save the Moslem-held town of Gorazde. Yesterday, diplomatic clarifications gave way to bombs as two US F-16 warplanes struck at the Serbian troops who were overrunning Gorazde's defences. Viewed charitably, Mr Perry's statement accurately reflects the Clinton administration's policy not to deploy US ground troops in Bosnia until a peace agreement has been reached. 'We will not enter the war to stop that (the fall of Gorazde) from happening,' he said. Ironically, Washington pundits at first welcomed Mr Perry as the strong voice the administration needed in foreign policy. The same pundits have been quick to dismiss him as a blundering neophyte who does not understand the subtleties of diplomacy. Few in Washington are now willing to view Mr Perry's remarks as an accurate version of official policy. Instead, they are seen either as the mixed message of an administration that in foreign policy does not know its own mind, or as a case of the military tail - forever reluctant to put US troops at risk - once again wagging the foreign policy dog. The latter impression was reinforced by Gen John Shalikashvili, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, who backed his civilian boss by emphatically insisting that the military circumstances around Gorazde made it impossible for the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation to repeat the threat of air strikes that had achieved considerable success in relieving the siege of Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital. Yesterday, Mr Warren Christopher, secretary of state, had to disavow Gen Shalikashvili, insisting that there were indeed targets for possible air strikes around Gorazde although they might not be as inviting as those around Sarajevo. Mr Christopher managed to be more gentle in his treatment of Mr Perry's remarks, but had his work cut out explaining that they were consistent with administration policy. He insisted that the US was ready to respond promptly to provide close air support for the protection of UN troops, although he implied the idea of air strikes for the sake of preserving Gorazde as a safe haven was some way off. Hours later, when the US warplanes dropped their bombs on Serbian tanks, they were, as it turned out, responding to a request from UN peacekeepers for close air support. Administration officials said that the earlier signals from Washington had been intended to reassure the Serbs at a moment when the efforts of Mr Charles Redman, the US peace envoy, to secure a peace agreement or at least a ceasefire seemed to have some chance at success.</p>

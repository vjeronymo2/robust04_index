			<p><P> July 30, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> GROUP SUES LAWYER FOR MALPRACTICE OVER FAILED RADIO STATION APPLICATION  </P> <P> A New Orleans group that tried unsuccessfully to open a radio station has filed  a malpractice suit against Thomas Root, the Washington lawyer involved in a  bizarre air odyssey that ended with his crash in the Bahamas earlier this  month.  </P> <P> The suit filed Thursday in state District Court in New Orleans accuses Root of  legal malpractice when representing a group seeking a Federal Communications  Commission license for a radio station in nearby Belle Chasse earlier this  year.  </P> <P> The suit said Root lied about certain things and failed to attend to details in  the licensing procedures. Root also told other groups vying for the license  that his group planned to drop their application, the suit said.  </P> <P> The effort to get the license failed and the group, called the Belle Chasse  Radio Limited Partnership, is asking for $125,000 in damages.  </P> <P> Root had told the station's investors that they would get a $125,000 settlement  for pulling out their application and then he allowed their application to be  dismissed, the suit alleged.  </P></p>

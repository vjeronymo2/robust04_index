The earlier meeting was  attended by the chief of staff, his deputy, and the Army chief  of intelligence, as well as Elyaqim Rubinstein, Ambassador  Itamar Rabinovich, and Uri Lubrani, the heads of the delegation  to the negotiations in Washington.    Our political correspondent Shlomo Raz reports that the  Israeli participants posed numerous questions to the U.S. team  about the Americans' interpretation of President al-Asad's  remarks in his talks with President Clinton. The Americans are  convinced that Syria is indeed prepared to reach full peace and  normalization with Israel. The Israelis also asked for  clarifications of the substance and price of peace and about the  security arrangements with Syria.</p>

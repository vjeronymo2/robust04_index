			<p><P> May 24, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> 'FRIGHT NIGHT II': BITING OFF MORE THAN THEY CAN CHEW  </P> <P> The original "Fright Night" film had a faintly homoerotic subtext, thanks to  the presence of chief vampire Chris Sarandon, who left the impression he might  be more than just bloodthirsty when it came to young hero William Ragsdale.  Ultimately, though, creator Tom Holland was more interested in doing a fun,  bloodied-up Saturday matinee than in morbid sexual tension, and Sarandon bit  the dust before he could bite too many youthful necks.  </P> <P> In "Fright Night: Part II" (citywide), the central vampire is a real vamp -- in  the form of indeterminately exotic Julie Carmen -- and it looks as though the  returning Ragsdale may be in real trouble this time. Finally free from the  clutches of the psychiatric care that the previous movie's traumas landed him  in, the kid (now in college) has repeated dreams in which he succumbs to this  succubus' charms instead of sticking by his less hot-to-trot girlfriend.  </P> <P> Outside of death itself, this kind of sexual paranoia and hysteria is the  horror genre's favorite thematic standby, and for a while it looks as if  "Fright Night II" is going to indulge in it, if not very originally, then at  least wholeheartedly. But then its luscious bloodsucker turns out to have pure  revenge, not seduction, on her mind, and director/co-writer Tommy Lee Wallace  ("Halloween III") proves to have nothing on his mind except effectively  remaking the first film.  </P> <P> Heads will roll (literally, in one scene in a bowling alley). But there's never  any tension generated over the fate of the endangered young couple, or of  worrisome Roddy McDowall, returning as "fearless vampire killer" and TV  horror-pic host Peter Vincent.  </P> <P> "Fright Night II" (rated R) looks good, thanks to the work of frequent  Cronenberg cinematographer Mark Irwin. But it pays no more attention to  supernatural "rules" than the first did, and try as Wallace might to duplicate  it, it's a much slower roller-coaster ride to boot. His was a fangless task.

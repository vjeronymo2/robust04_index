			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / Muted welcome for 'green' farm reforms CONSERVATIONISTS gave a qualified welcome to a Pounds 30m package of government measures unveiled yesterday to encourage farmers to preserve the countryside and allow greater public access to their land. Under the proposals, announced by Mrs Gillian Shephard, agriculture minister, the number of areas in England designated as 'environmentally sensitive' would rise from 16 to 22, covering a total of 1.15m hectares, or 10 per cent of England's agricultural land. Farmers would be paid for managing land in these areas in environmentally friendly ways such as cutting the number of sheep grazing it or maintaining hedgerows. The proposals have been sent to the European Commission for approval under the Agri-Environment Regulation that accompanied reform of the Common Agricultural Policy last year and required member states to come up with ways of rewarding farmers for looking after the countryside. The other new measures, all designed to take effect next year, include a moorland protection scheme, a scheme to create or improve wildlife habitats, further protection of drinking water sources from fertiliser nitrates, financial incentives for organic farming, and plans for greater public access to land left fallow. The government has already responded to conservationists' concerns by changing the rules on rotational set-aside last month to protect wildlife from damage when fallow fields are cut or ploughed for re-sowing. Mr Paul Wynne, land use officer for the Council for the Protection of Rural England, said the new measures are 'a small but positive step. 'However, much more money should be allocated to positive management of the countryside. This could be achieved by shifting resources away from wasteful schemes like set-aside, which pays farmers to lay land idle at a cost to the UK taxpayer of Pounds 150m every year, to environmental schemes which reward farmers positively for looking after the countryside.' The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds said the habitat scheme could create 8,000 hectares of new habitat for wildlife each year. 'There are some extremely good things here,' said Mr John Taylor, head of policy research. Valuable wildlife habitats on land left fallow under the five-year voluntary set-aside scheme just ended could now be saved from the plough, thanks to proposed payments to farmers of Pounds 275 per hectare per year to keep it out of production for 20 years, he said. However, some planned payments, for example to sheep farmers reducing the size of flocks on moorland, were too low to work, he said. The new environmentally sensitive areas will be in the Blackdown Hills in Devon, the Cotswolds, Dartmoor, the Essex Coast, the Upper Thames tributaries and the Shropshire hills. They will account for the largest proportion of spending, set to reach Pounds 30m by 1995-96. Observer, Page 13</p>

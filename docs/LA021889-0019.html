			<p><P> February 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UCLA FAN CALLS ONE AGAINST THE TIMES  </P> <P> Usually, The Times' incredible bias against UCLA sports is at least subtle, but  it was blatant in Jerry Crowe's article on the Louisville game.  </P> <P> Crowe devoted more than 80% of the article to the goaltending call, ignoring  some not-so-great calls against UCLA and glossing over the Bruins' rebounding,  their low (number of) turnovers and their tremendous effort against all the  players Denny Crum was able to shuttle in.  </P> <P> Crowe devoted eight words to the man who knew best: "Was it goaltending?  Ellison said he wasn't sure."  </P> <P> WALTER R. JOHNSON  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

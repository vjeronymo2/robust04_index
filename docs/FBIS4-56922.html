			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Luis Alberto Jimenez] </F>   [Text] A few minutes ago, the virtual winner of the 8 May  elections, Ernesto Perez Balladares, left the home of Mrs.  Mireya Moscoso de Gruber. They gave statements to the press.  They said the PRD [Democratic Revolutionary Party] had offered  the Arnulfist Party two ministries. Dr. Perez Balladares also  said that there are no partisan positions [espacios politicos]  in his government. He also thanked Mrs. Mireya Moscoso de  Gruber for welcoming him to her home.    [Begin recording] [Moscoso de Gruber] Dr. Perez Balladares  visited me this morning to discuss certain matters. One of the  offers he made was that of one or two ministries in his  government. I have told him that I am not the one to decide and  that the party's National Executive Committee [CEN] must be  approached with this offer, and whatever the party decides is  what will be done. I am not the one who decides.    [Jimenez] What ministries could these be?    [Moscoso de Gruber] He only offered two ministries; I do not  know which ministries. But the party has to decide.    [Jimenez] If the Arnulfist Party declares itself in  opposition, then would it not be lacking in political principles  if it becomes part of the government?    [Moscoso de Gruber] After 1 September, my party will  definitely be in opposition. The decision must be made by the  party's CEN. I am the president of the party. I do like to  preside over the meetings in a democratic manner, however, and  let the CEN decide. Therefore, we must wait. This must be  presented at a meeting to see what happens.    [Jimenez] Sousa Lennox has been mentioned as someone to fill  a ministerial post. Is he a member of the Arnulfist Party?    [Moscoso de Gruber] Yes he is. If any member of the  Arnulfist Party makes a decision without previously consulting  with the party, that decision will be declared unauthorized by  the party.    [Jimenez] Would you accept participation in a PRD  government?    [Moscoso de Gruber] No, I would not.    [Jimenez] What about other party members?    [Moscoso de Gruber] That would have to be discussed by the  CEN. [end recording]    These were statements made by Mireya Moscoso de Gruber upon  meeting with Perez Balladares at her home. Also in attendance  at the meeting were Immigration Director Antonio Dominguez and  Government and Justice Minister Jacobo Salas. According to  statements by Dr. Perez Balladares, the meeting was cordial. He  said they talked about the country's future and not the future  of the political parties, in this case the Arnulfist Party and  the PRD. Dr. Perez Balladares announced he will be visiting  other candidates who ran against him in the 8 May elections in  an attempt to create a consensus government.</p>

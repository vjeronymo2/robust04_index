			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jorge Kalin] </F>   [Text] The change of command in the Sandinist People's Army  (EPS) "will take time, perhaps months," Major General Joaquin  Cuadra Lacayo, General Humberto Ortega Saavedra's virtual  replacement, said yesterday.    Maj. Gen. Cuadra yesterday represented the EPS at an  official  function the National Assembly held in honor of Taiwanese  President Li Teng-hui. Cuadra was accompanied at all times by  Lieutenant Colonel Ricardo Wheelock, Armed Forces public  relations chief.    Days earlier, Wheelock also accompanied Cuadra when he held  a  news conference in Matagalpa to discuss military operations  against criminal groups. Since then, the EPS chief of staff has  been seen more frequently in public. According to the command  roster, he is Gen. Ortega's virtual successor.    "In all armies there is a transition period in which the  chief of a unit must turn over everything in order," Cuadra  insisted.    We then asked the high-ranking EPS officer: "In the case of  the Army, how long will this process take?" He responded: "It  will be a prudent period of time, which will be very clear under  the law... but do not worry, because you will learn about it in  coming days."    Regarding the honors that Gen. Ortega might receive after he  retires, Cuadra said this is not included in the Military  Organization Law. Nevertheless, he said, "Gen. Ortega has made  many contributions to the country and will continue to do so.  Therefore he deserves society's recognition."  <H5>  Lacayo: No More Tensions </H5>   Meanwhile, Presidency Minister Antonio Lacayo admitted that  with the recent agreement between the Army and the executive and  legislative branches on the Military Code and the Army chief's  departure, the dispute with the military command has "finally  and completely" ended.    Regarding the date for Gen. Ortega's departure, Lacayo  replied: "Ask BARRICADA." On Wednesday, 4 May, this newspaper  reported that an agreement had been reached on the date -- 21  February 1995 -- during a "secret meeting" on 3 May.    Ramiro Gurdian, president of COSEP [Higher Council of  Private  Enterprise], said he hoped that Gen. Ortega's departure would  come sooner, but he added that the date announced "is good,  because it removes tension from the political environment."    Minister Lacayo confirmed the existence of a comprehensive  plan against the criminal groups, as was announced by Gen.  Ortega.    "This plan has been in operation since 15 April. I said in  Jinotega that once the last group of the 3-80 Northern Front was  demobilized, there would be opportunity to fight with firmness  and a strong hand those robbers who are attacking producers,"  Lacayo added.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Mikhail Karpov: "Rules of Bon Ton for the `Nine'" </F>   [Text] Paris--  <H5>  The European Stability Pact Conference, Which Opened </H5> Yesterday in Paris, Is Designed To Define Them"]    The idea of the conclusion of a European Stability Pact,  which was put forward, as we know, by French Prime Minister  Edouard Balladur immediately upon assuming office in April 1993,  has been transformed into a collective initiative of the EU,  Russia welcomed it from the very outset, according to Foreign  Minister A. Kozyrev, since it "is consonant with Russia's work  on a strengthening of stability on the European Continent."    In the opinion of Balladur, which is shared by the Russian  side, the launch conference in Paris should signify the start of  a process of signing bilateral agreements and treaties and the  organization of a number of roundtables for negotiations of a  bilateral or regional nature on the consideration of regional  aspects of good-neighbor relations between different countries.  A third party would participate in them also, which would make  it possible to impart to them greater objectivity. The EU and  its bodies or individual members could act in this capacity. It  is contemplated subsequently to summarize the agreements reached  in the course of this process in the text of the European  Stability Pact.    It is perfectly obvious that this initiative is addressed to  the nine states of Central and Eastern Europe and the Baltic who  are endeavoring to become members of the EU. Before the opening  of the Paris conference, Alain Juppe, French minister of foreign  affairs, declared that it was designed "to define the rules of  bon ton" for these countries without, nonetheless, establishing  conditions of admittance for them.    The main factors causing concern are the inter-nation and  interethnic conflicts and the position of national minorities.  They are typical to this extent or the other of practically each  of the nine countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the  Baltic. It is emphasized that the conference will exclude from  its field of vision the crises in Bosnia, Crimea, and the  Caucasus. They erupted long since, and the tasks of the European  Stability Pact are primarily to exclude new ones arising.    Little is said about Russia's role in the conclusion of the  European Stability Pact. According to Kozyrev, it "is ready, of  course, to make its contribution in the form that we deem  expedient." In his speech at the Paris conference, the minister  emphasized repeatedly the role and significance of the CSCE in  the building of a new Europe, stressing that "matters pertaining  to borders, as, equally, national minorities, should be  discussed exclusively within the framework established by  documents of the CSCE...."    One further distinguishing feature of the future pact will  be  its political, not military, character. Alain Juppe, in  particular, pointed to this, and Andrey Kozyrev declared plainly  that "the present conference benefits from the fact that  questions of stability in Europe are being framed here from the  angle of democracy and human rights, not in a military context."    Kozyrev simultaneously also supported military-political  change finding its place in the channel of broader efforts. He  confirmed that Russia would, in affiliating with the Partnership  for Peace, sign a corresponding framework document with NATO  together with a substantive program of cooperation, which, "of  course, will reflect Russia's special role as a nuclear power."  "We are for a deepening of the equal partnership of Russia and  NATO without mutual vetoes and surprises," Kozyrev emphasized.    After his speech, Edouard Balladur had a conversation with  Andrey Kozyrev lasting almost an hour. Russia's role in the  settlement of European conflicts, which France values highly,  was discussed. The Russian side expressed particular concern at  the slowdown in the process of Russia's membership of European  structures. Balladur assured Kozyrev that all objections on the  part of France had now been removed and that he saw no obstacles  to Russia's membership in European institutions.</p>

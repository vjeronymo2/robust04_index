			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Tian Huiming (3944 1920 2494)] </F>   [Text] Fan Gang, a middle-aged economist who is quite  famous on the mainland, was appointed vice director of the  Chinese Academy of Social Sciences Economics Institute a few  days ago.    The Economics Institute is a comprehensive research  institute  engaged in research on the macroeconomy. Most of the  institute's former directors and vice directors have been  seasoned economists.    Fan, 40, went to the Great Northern Wilderness in northeast  China to join the local production and construction corps in the  1960's. He was admitted to the Economics Department of Hebei  University in 1978 and to the Postgraduate Institute of  Economics of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in 1982. He  then received Master's and doctorate degrees. From 1985 to  1987, he was at Harvard as a visiting scholar. Since 1988, he  has worked with the economics institute.    Fan's ideas are dynamic and he is an industrious writer. He  has published many books, of which the important ones are:  Theoretical Outline of Publicly Owned Macro Economy,  (he was the principal author of this book); Comparison and  Synthesis of Three Major Contemporary Economic Theoretical  Systems; and Progressive Path-- Economic Ideas in  Economic Reform. He has also published over 100 academic  papers with two million characters in total, including "Gray  Market Theories" in JINGJI YANJIU [ECONOMIC RESEARCH] and other  academic journals. His work has had a rather big impact on  theoretical circles. In 1992 he was promoted to the Chinese  Academy of Social Sciences as a researcher, which was an  exception to the rule, and was conferred with the title of a  state-level middle-aged and younger expert, as he had made  outstanding contributions, and in 1993 he became one of the  youngest tutors of doctoral students in social science circles.    Recently, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences has boldly  promoted a number of middle-aged and younger scholars to  leadership positions. Li Peilin, 39, was appointed vice  director of the Institute of Sociology; Cai Fang, 37, vice  director of the Institute of Population Studies; Zhuo Xinping,  39, vice director of the Institute of Research on World  Religions, and Zhao Yifan, over 40, vice director of the  Institute of Foreign Literature.</p>

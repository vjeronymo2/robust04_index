			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / World Trade News: UTC in more China ventures - Ventures and Contracts United Technologies (UTC), the US aero-engines, helicopters, lifts and air-conditioning group, is forming another 13 joint ventures in China. The new ventures are in several regions of China and follow 10 existing UTC ventures. For the first time the ventures will include Pratt &amp; Whitney, UTC's aero-engine producer, and Sikorsky, its helicopter company. UTC's sales in China soared from Dollars 79.1m in 1989 to an estimated Dollars 520.6m this year, with the Otis lift and escalator business accounting for Dollars 213.3m. Otis and Carrier, the air-conditioning company, currently have four Chinese joint ventures apiece, and are each in the process of forming three more. UTC claims Chinese market shares of 24 per cent and 20.5 per cent for elevators and air-conditioning respectively. Mr George David, president and chief executive, predicted strong growth for both businesses in China. P&amp;W's sales in China have risen from Dollars 29.3m in 1989 to an estimated Dollars 198.8m this year. Mr David said there was not room for 'three engine companies on one wing' - a reference to the fierce battle between P&amp;W, General Electric of the US and Rolls-Royce of the UK for engine orders on the Boeing 777.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Imelda Alvarenga; from the "Facing the Moment" </F> newscast]    [Text] Jorge Martinez, Unity Movement presidential  candidate, expressed disagreement on Wednesday with the Onusal  [UN Observer Mission in El Salvador] Electoral Division's  assessment that the Supreme Electoral Tribunal [TSE] registry is  satisfactory. The Electoral Division's second report terms as  satisfactory the voter registry even though approximately 60,000  persons will not be able to vote for lack of a voter  identification card.    [Begin Martinez recording] We consider the TSE's response to  be insufficient. Too many people have been left without their  voter identification cards. Tens of thousands of people who are  registered to vote have been denied the right to be told why  they will not get their voter identification cards. They are  simply not given one. It is also said a large number of citizens  requested their voter identification cards but their data was  lost in the computers' memories. We believe things could have  been improved. [end recording]    Furthermore, the Unity Movement candidate criticized ARENA  [Nationalist Republican Alliance] for using state resources in  its campaign. [Begin Martinez recording] The media has been  invaded by the government with a shameless electoral publicity  in favor of ARENA. In fact, state-owned presses, like the one at  the National Geographic Institute, have been printing political  propaganda for ARENA. This has been reported by the workers.  [end recording]    Finally, Jorge Martinez announced that municipal government  plans are being discussed with different candidates throughout  the country. Martinez said his party's main strategy will be to  sponsor the citizens' participation through open town council  meetings.</p>

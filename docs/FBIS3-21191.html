			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] The value of Aichi Prefecture's industrial shipments  accounts for 11.4% of the nation's total. It has been in  first  place in Japan since 1977.    Aichi has a broad range of industries. It has local  industries such as textiles, ceramics, and food processing. It  is in a broad range of fields involving mechatronics, including  automobiles, machine tools, electrical equipment, and precision  machinery. It is also achieving noteworthy developments in new  technology fields such as fine ceramics and aerospace.    Aichi's excellent record in ``making things'' has been  attributed to: a wealth of natural resources such as land,  water, and ports; its position in the middle of the Tokaido  megalopolis stretching from Tokyo to Osaka; its superb  transportation infrastructure of railroads and highways; and its  reliable management resources and local networks which have been  fostered since the time of the Owari daimyo.    Facing the twenty-first century the Tokai region centering  around Aichi hopes to become even more of an industrial capitol  focused on manufacturing as a key region in manufacturing  technology which is open to the world.    Aichi is culturally active. In October 1992 Aichi opened the  Aichi Arts and Culture Center where opera can be fully staged.  Aichi also has long fostered the traditional theatrical arts.  <H3>  Preparations for a Headquarters of R&amp;D and Exchange:  Science and Technology Exchange Center Plans and Toyohashi  Science Core </H3>   Aichi is planning an important development and research area  called the Aichi Science R&amp;D Center which will center in the  20  kilometer hilly region to the west and east of Nagoya. It is  trying to build a national center for research exchange which  will rival Tsukuba and the Kansai region by attracting leading  technology companies, laboratories, and universities for  research centered in this geographic zone. As part of its plan,  Aichi is planning a Science and Technology Exchange Center  (tentative name) as a center for researchers' exchange. This  will be the pioneering project of its central zone area, a  candidate for a 21st Century world's fair (see below).  Currently, Aichi aims to set up by 1994 the foundation that will  be the main organization. It is making final adjustments as it  develops a consensus among the region's industry, academia, and  national research institutes. It is already, as expected,  expanding research exchange by establishing and running exchange  groups organized on a membership basis and by holding forums.  According to the plan, once the facilities are completed the  work of education, information dissemination, and promotion of  cooperative research will begin in earnest using the Center as  headquarters. This will be part of a process of establishing a  world-class industrial technology R&amp;D region which will be a  center for disseminating scientific and technical around the  world.    Moreover plans are being carried forward for Science Create  21 which would establish a industry-academia-government R&amp;D  base  centered on Toyohashi Technical University of Technology in  Toyohashi, the main city in the Toyokawa region. Toyohashi  Science Core was completed in November 1992 as Science Create  21's key facility under Civil Law (minkotsu) Number 1. It will  be operated by the third sector Science Create 21 K.K. which was  established to promote the improvement and activity of the  Toyokawa region's industry. It is developing projects in areas  such as joint R&amp;D, personnel training, industry-academia  exchanges, and support for nurturing new companies. It will  thereby support the region's R&amp;D and technology development  activities.  <H3>  Strengthening the Development of Frontier Technology and  Design: Chubu Aerospace Industry Technology Promotion Center and  International Design Center </H3>   Aichi is aggressively addressing the issue of promoting next  generation frontier technologies at the same times as it builds  an R&amp;D base. The 1988 Aichi Prefecture Industrial Technology  Promotion Plan named frontier technologies which the region  should target: mechatronics, new materials, aerospace,  artificial intelligence, and biotechnology. In addition to  promoting the location in Aichi of national-level research  laboratories in these technology areas, Aichi is promoting  international technology exchange by attracting various  international conferences. Since the small but concentrated  aerospace industry involves advanced technology with  applications to many industries, in 1989 the Chubu Aerospace  Industry Technology Promotion Research Center was established  through industry-academia cooperation. In September 1993 it was  expanded into the Chubu Aerospace Industry Technology Promotion  Center for the purpose of expanding its work and strengthening  its structure. The Center will promote the region's policy  initiatives, research exchange, and diffusion of technology to  other industries. The Tokai region already accounts for about  50% of the nation's aerospace assembly work, but it's  planning  to increase that concentration by attracting related large-scale  testing and evaluation facilities such as high Reynolds number  wind tunnels.    The prefecture is also putting its energy into improving  design development ability, another part of strengthening  research capabilities. Design is playing a more and more  important role in linking industry and life and in linking high  technology and emotions. The prefecture is building an  International Design Center to strengthen design capabilities  and to establish a base for the world-wide transmission of  design information. For that purpose a third sector corporation  was set up with the cooperation of the prefecture, Nagoya city,  and business. The building is planned to open in 1996.  <H3>  Strengthening Regional Information Transmission:  Transportation Infrastructure Preparation and Holding a World's  Fair in 2005 </H3>   Aichi and the rest of the Tokai region are strongly  promoting  the expansion of the region's transportation infrastructure for  the 21st century, including roads and the Tokai-Hokuriku line,  through three big public-private projects: Chubu New  International Airport, Number 2 Tokyo-Nagoya/Nagoya-Kobe  Highway, and the Chuo Shinkansen train line.    Aichi's prosperity as an industrial region has rested on its  fortunate geographic location in the center of Japan, a  strategic point in national transportation, including roads,  railroads, and ports. However, it is important that Aichi  improve its transportation system so that it increases its role  as an information base open to Japan and to the world. Only then  can Aichi change towards a more balanced industrial structure  less skewed toward processing and assembly. Only then can it  hope to step up to become a key region for industrial technology  open to the world, the kind of region advocated by the Fourth  National Comprehension Plan? of the 21st century.    Aichi is planning to complete this infrastructure by 2005  because it will hold the 21st century's first world's fair.  Aichi is trying to attract [participants] from all over the  world and is engaging in various kinds of preparation -- with  the support of the relevant ministries such as MITI and the  Ministry of Foreign Affairs -- for the 21st Century World's Fair  (tentative name) which is planned to be the largest exhibition  in Japan since the 1970 world's fair in Osaka.    The candidate region has selected the southeast portion of  Seto City in the heart of the above-mentioned Aichi Science  R&amp;D  Zone. It has a theme rooted in the area's potential: Technical  and cultural exchange--Creation of a new world.    The Committee for the Basic Concept of the 21st Century  World's Fair (chairman: N. Kimura, professor emeritus,  University of Tokyo) made up of learned persons from various  fields is moving towards selecting a basic concept by June 1994.  An interim report echoed the basic significance of a world's  fair by proposing ``a `New world's fair as a grove for exchange  among global citizens' in which the world's people think,  discuss, propose and identify solutions, and disseminate their  information to the world.'' The committee is groping for a new  approach to operation, participation, and other aspects of  holding the event.    After the basic concept has been accepted by Aichi and the  nation has decided to go ahead with holding the fair, a formal  application will be made to the Bureau of International  Expositions (BIE) in 1996, nine years in advance. Aichi has done  public relations work with foreign countries at the World's Fair  in Sevile and the Genoa exhibition in 1992 and at the Taejon,  Korea, exhibition in 1993. Hopes are high that if the BIE grants  permission and the world's fair is held successfully, then the  incredible information-spreading power of a world's fair will  offer an opportunity for rapid progress in the region and, in  turn, will foster information and develop the region's industry.</p>

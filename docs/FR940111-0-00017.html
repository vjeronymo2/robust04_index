			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters also asked that the Service begin sending copies of notices to anyone assisting an applicant or petitioner, and not simply to authorized representatives. However, while the Service cannot limit or control who can assist others in filling out and filing an application or petition, only a person who meets the criteria in 8 CFR parts 1 and 292 can act as the applicant or petitioner's authorized representative and submit a Form G&hyph;28. A person who does not meet these criteria cannot represent the applicant or petitioner, and cannot be notified of any action taken on the application or petition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters opposed the proposed modification of when the Service would send a notice by certified mail. After review, this proposal has been withdrawn. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Filing <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A number of commenters requested that additional filing instructions be included on forms to eliminate confusion about where to file. Last year the Service began to include such specific information on the new generation of application and petition forms. This process will continue as older versions of forms are replaced or eliminated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters asked that application and petition forms be published for public comment since the instructions have the effect of regulation. All form revisions are carefully reviewed to ensure they are consistent with regulations. In addition to informally circulating significant changes to forms for comment, the Service intends to begin to publish form revisions as required and as deemed necessary for effective communications. The Service is committed to revising forms on a more frequent basis to keep up with ever changing immigration laws and changes in procedures. The Service wants to assist people in learning about immigration benefits for which they may be eligible, and help them understand what is required to file a complete application. This will facilitate quicker processing and minimize the delays and additional processing costs associated with requests for more information or evidence. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As suggested by many commenters, language has been added to clarify that a child can file an application or petition for himself or herself, in addition to allowing a parent or legal guardian to file. Other commenters suggested that anyone be allowed to file such a petition, pointing to 8 CFR 101.6(b)(1), which permits such a broad group of persons to file petitions for juveniles dependent on a juvenile court in the United States. However, except for these unique circumstances, there is no valid reason to allow a person who has no legal authority over a child to assume the right to act in the child's behalf before the Service. Therefore, this suggestion has not been adopted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposal to allow the filing of photocopies of documents with applications and petitions instead of originals was universally applauded as a significant step in streamlining filing procedures. However, one commenter asked whether each copy would need to be certified that it is exact and unaltered. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Evidence submitted in the context of an application or petition is part of that application or petition. See 8 CFR 270.1. By signing the application or petition form, the person certifies under penalty of perjury that the application or petition, and all evidence submitted with it, is true and correct. The rule has been clarified to indicate that a separate certification for each copy is not necessary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters asked that the rule be revised so that in cases where an applicant or petitioner submits an original when he or she could have submitted a copy, the Service would be required to make the copy and return the original. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service recognizes that people need to retain original documents for their records. This was one of the primary reasons why the Service made the decision to accept photocopies. However, the Service processes over 4 million applications and petitions each year. In cases where a person chooses to submit originals instead of copies, the Service is not in a position to make the copies for him or her so the originals can be returned. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule provided that where the Service determines a need to review the original of a document, the applicant or petitioner would have 30 days to submit the original document. Several commenters suggested that 30 days does not allow enough time, since people might not have the document and would have to get one from the issuing authority. They suggested a 60 or 90-day period instead. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The idea of allowing copies was proposed so applicants and petitioners can file a copy and keep the original, not so they can file a copy because they don't have an original. By filing a copy as part of their application or petition, they are attesting that the copy is true and correct. This would be problematic if they do not have an original. However, to minimize confusion and to standardize the various response periods provided in this rule, the final rule provides 12 weeks, without extension, for submission of an original document. If an applicant or petitioner does not submit the requested original document within that 12-week period, the application or petition will be denied for failure to provide the original. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters asked that the Service begin to accept copies and computer-generated versions of application and petition forms, and to allow filing by facsimile. The Service will accept photocopies and computer-generated versions that are  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> identical <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  to Service forms in all respects, including placement, perforations and fastener holes. We cannot accept facsimiles because they do not meet these requirements. It is essential that the forms not vary in any way from the original since the Service is introducing imaging systems and other systems to speed processing that depend on exact form specifications. The Service is also very interested in electronic filing as a way of speeding processing and reducing costs, and is researching various technologies that would allow such filing with fee transmittal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Initial Evidence <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

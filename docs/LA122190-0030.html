			<p><P> December 21, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGUITO BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT;  </P> <P> DANA HILLS MISSES GAME AFTER MIX-UP, FACES COIN FLIP TODAY  </P> <P> Dana Hills and San Clemente high schools will have a coin flip to decide which  team advances in the San Dieguito boys' basketball tournament after the teams  did not play their scheduled game Thursday because of a scheduling mix-up.  </P> <P> "Unfortunately, we are going to have a coin flip (today)," tournament director  David LaBorde said.  </P> <P> "We were going to try to play the game (today) but couldn't get the  arrangements made."  </P> <P> The Dolphins were to play San Clemente at 7:30 p.m. Thursday at Carlsbad High  School, but tipoff time was changed to 5:30 because of construction scheduled  for the gymnasium. San Clemente was notified, but Dana Hills Coach Rich Skelton  said he was not, and the Dana Hills team arrived at 6:30 for the game.  </P> <P> The game, however, had been officially ruled a forfeit at 6:15.  </P> <P> LaBorde reversed the decision, allowing the game to be rescheduled, pending  arrangements. But those arrangements could not be made. ARA NAJARIAN  </P></p>

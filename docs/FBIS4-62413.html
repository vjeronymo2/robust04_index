			<p>BFN     [Text] The Georgian and Abkhazian delegations to Moscow  agreed on the disengagement of forces and the deployment of a  Commonwealth peacekeeping contingent on the confrontation line  on the Inguri river.    In line with a formal agreement signed Saturday [14 May]  night, the Georgian and Abkhazian units are to move 12 km away  from the river and a peacekeeping contingent is to take up  positions inside the 24-km buffer zone.    On Sunday, a member of the Abkhazian delegation and a  special  emissary of the chairman of the Abkhazian parliament Andrey  Djerghenia said Russian troops would most likely serve on the  disengagement force.    He said the 2,500 to 3,000 strong contingent would be  introduced before the end of May. Russian units deployed in  Abkhazia would make part of it.    On Georgian demand, peacekeepers would patrol the Kodor  canyon after the withdrawal from it of Georgian forces,  Djerghenia said.    According to Djerghenia, the introduction of a peacekeeping  contingent into Abkhazia paved a way to the repatriation of  refugees, first of all to the Galski District.    In Moscow, the Georgian and Abkhazian negotiators agreed to  form a joint commission on practical problems in the fields of  power production, transport and comunication, environmental  protection, etc. The four-member commission would be expected  to start work on 1 June in Sochi.    The delegations agreed to discuss the status of Abkhazia  next  month in Geneva.</p>

			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / International Company News: Blockbuster up at Dollars 39.2m BLOCKBUSTER, the Florida-based video rental chain, yesterday reported after-tax profits of Dollars 39.2m in the first quarter of 1993, against Dollars 25.7m in the same period of 1992. Revenues rose to Dollars 608.7m from Dollars 446.4m a year earlier, and earnings per share, on a fully-diluted basis, increased to 20 cents from 15 cents. Part of the increase came from Blockbuster's aggressive expansion to build a more broadly-based home entertainment group.</p>

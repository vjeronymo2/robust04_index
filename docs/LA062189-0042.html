			<p><P> June 21, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ NOTES : DRUMMER LEAVES TV TO PROMOTE ALBUM; TRANSFER CONCERT TO BENEFIT  MOUNTAINS TRUST  </P> <P> Chuck Morris, formerly with Cameo, Chaka Khan and most recently saxophonist  Paul Russo, has been hired to replace Terri Lyne Carrington as the drummer on  "The Arsenio Hall Show." Carrington gave up her lucrative position -- union  scale for musicians on a TV show is approximately $1,350 per week -- to promote  her debut recording, "Real Life Story" (Verve/Forecast), which has been one of  the Top 5 contemporary jazz albums on the Billboard magazine charts for several  weeks.  </P> <P> "She wanted to leave the show occasionally and go on the road in support of her  album," said Hall musical director Michael Wolff. "But this band isn't set up  that way. It's not like 'The Tonight Show.' You can't have subs."  </P> <P> Wolff picked Morris, saying, "We decided to go with a sleeper, a sort of  unknown guy who could really commit to being in the band. He's from the South,  and he plays like a New Orleans drummer, with a great back-beat feel."  </P> <P> Carrington could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> MOUNTAINS TRUST BENEFIT: The vocal quartet Manhattan Transfer, altoist Richie  Cole, singer Kenny Rankin, composer Robert Kraft and groups featuring  guitarists Wayne Johnson, Jorge Strunz and Ardeshire Farah are all donating  their services this Friday at the Wiltern Theatre in a benefit for Mountains  Trust.  </P> <P> "Mountains Trust is a land trust which owns and protects land in the Santa  Monica mountains," said concert producer Michael Skoletsky, "and the proceeds  from this concert will go toward purchasing additional acreage." Since its  inception in 1981, the trust has accumulated 1,200 acres which has either been  donated to the National Park Service -- the organization donated 200 acres last  March -- or kept as preserves. One of the latter is the Cold Creek Canyon  Preserve near Malibu, which is open to the public on a reservation basis.  </P> <P> Tickets for the benefit are $25, or $125 for gold circle, which includes a  pre-performance party with the artists. Information: (213) 456-5625, 308-5005.  </P> <P> BANDS ON THE AIR: Big bands from Eagle Rock, Hamilton, San Fernando and  Washington high schools will be seen on "Jazz Festival/89," a half-hour TV show  that airs on KCLS (Channel 58). "The bands were selected by judges Ndugu  Chancler and John Deichman from 10 semifinalists, who were screened from the  many Los Angeles Unified School District school bands that sent in audition  tapes," said Ralph Jungheim, who produced the event in conjunction with  Performing Tree Inc. and the school district. The program, taped in April at  the Musicians Union on Vine Street in Hollywood, will be hosted by saxophonist  Gerald Albright (Locke High School class of 1975) and will air Saturday at 2:30  p.m., Wednesday, 8:30 p.m. and July 2 at 10:30 a.m. Information: (213)  625-6958.  </P> <P> Jungheim -- who has produced about a dozen LPs, including Joe Williams' 1985  Grammy-winning "Nothin' But the Blues" (Delos) -- was in New York last week,  overseeing a new LP by singer Ruth Brown, who won a 1989 Tony Award as best  leading actress in a musical ("Black and Blue"). "It was a blues date," said  Jungheim -- who produced Brown's last LP, "Have a Good Time" (Fantasy) -- "and  it was terrific." No title has been set for the session, which featured  saxophonist Red Holloway, keyboardist Bobby Forrester and guitarist Rodney  Jones and is due out in August, also on Fantasy.  </P> <P> JAZZ FOR THE SINGLE SET: You've heard of "The Love Connection," now check out  the Jazz Connection, an occasional series of events where jazz fans can gather,  hear some good sounds and, as promoter-musician Gordon Halligan put it,  "hopefully meet new people who like jazz and have similar interests." Halligan  started the Jazz Connection last year and has been holding events steadily  since December, either in private homes or at the Le Mondrian Hotel, where his  next concert, featuring his own band, will be Saturday. The party runs from  7:30 p.m. until midnight, costs $20, and includes free valet parking, free  appetizers and a no-host bar. Information: (213) 662-3639.  </P></p>

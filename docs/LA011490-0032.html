			<p><P> January 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALLA BREVE: ADAMS: "FEARFUL SYMMETRIES," "THE WOUND DRESSER." SANFORD SYLVAN,  BARITONE; JOHN ADAMS CONDUCTING THE ORCHESTRA OF ST. LUKE'S. ELEKTRA NONESUCH 9  79218-2 (COMPACT DISC).  </P> <P> Based on the Whitman poem, "The Wound Dresser" is a vividly atmospheric piece,  with stunning orchestral touches supporting the arching, aching, yet  understated vocal line.  </P> <P> Sylvan supplies dignity and clarity, with well-balanced accompaniment from the  composer. "Fearful Symmetries" is equally deftly scored, but in the cause of a  relentless pop parody. It swiftly outlasts its welcome, though the disc as a  whole lasts only a stingy 47 minutes. John Henken  </P></p>

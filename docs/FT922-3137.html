			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Unit costs variations LABOUR'S survey indicated wide variations in the unit costs of providing Youth Training and Employment Training across England and Wales. The figures appeared to show that in Suffolk, for example, a YT place cost Pounds 65.15 a week, while in South Glamorgan it cost Pounds 34.19. Tecs pointed to technical reasons for the variations, as well as differences in local requirements. Mr Mike Bax, chief executive of Suffolk Tec, said his was one of 11 areas involved in the government's pilot training credits scheme, and extra money allocated for the pilot had been incorporated within unit costs. Department of Employment officials also suggested that some Tecs may have excluded 25 per cent bonuses related to qualifications achieved by trainees.</p>

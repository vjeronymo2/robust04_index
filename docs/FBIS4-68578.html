			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Aslan Abashidze, chairman of the Ajarian </F> Supreme Council, by Lyubov Volkova; date and place not given:  "Georgia: There Is a Small Passage Amid the Flames"]    [Text]    [Volkova] Aslan Ibraimovich, Ajaria is the only oasis of  internal stability, civil accord, and law and order in Georgia  today. How do you explain this situation, which inspires such  hope? How do you manage to preserve peace amid the fires of war  on your little strip of land?    [Abashidze] I will answer with a parable. A father says to  his son: When you buy a house from a man who built that house  with his own hands, do not make the mistake of haggling with him  -- whatever happens, he will not give in. He knows what the  house cost him. If he did not build it himself, haggle away; he  will lower his price, perhaps even give it to you for a song,  because he has invested nothing in it of his own. I am the  same. I know how we have kept peace by a hairbreadth.    [Volkova] Is it true that you offered your own family --  your wife, children, and grandson -- as hostages for talks in  Abkhazia?    [Abashidze] There was a time when I thought that events in  Abkhazia could be slowed down or halted. And I proposed that  Ardzinba come here for talks. I felt that he was simply wary of  traveling outside Abkhazia. Now, once upon a time in days of  old, kings, in order to establish good relations among  themselves, made use of family affairs -- they married  princesses or gave their daughters in marriage to a king's son.  And this was a very civilized form of establishing firm,  friendly relations. I did not come up with any new idea.    But do not imagine that I was prepared for this. I simply  felt during my telephone conversation with Ardzinba that he  might not agree to come, and I used my final argument -- that  which is most dear to me, my wife, daughters, and grandson. I  guarantee everyone safety, I said. If this is not enough, I  will come to Abkhazia myself. Then he agreed. But I found no  supporters in the Georgian parliament.    There are forces interested in ensuring that instability is  maintained in Georgia for as long as possible. For it is  instability which keeps these people afloat. If the war ends,  it will be time to build. And then they will prove to be  superfluous, just as they were before.    Take a look at this photograph: Who do you think this is?  It is my father's youngest brother. A most powerful  personality, a historic personality. He is a general; they  write about him a lot. You know, when they did away with this  class -- in both Russia and Georgia -- great harm was done to  the nations. Generation after generation the race put forward  its best sons. They had the opportunity to receive a brilliant  education, brilliant training. The most difficult burdens lay  on their shoulders. Both in our country and in Russia. They  were all in the first ranks. And then they were destroyed; the  flower of our nation was destroyed, decapitated. And how much  of our moral life disappeared together with them. You know,  they had a very firm framework which they could not overstep.  They had honor, conscience, morality, a nation. Everything was  destroyed. And now it is like this: A man comes along who  knows nothing. He makes a speech in parliament: "Why do we  need the Russian ruble? Why are we entering the ruble zone?  Let us enter the hard currency zone!" Can you imagine it? As  though the United States would open its banks right now and say:  "How much do you want?" And hand out dollars to all and  sundry. Only Russia is capable of such expansive gestures. For  the sake of the relations which formerly existed. You can kill  a Russian soldier, you can label Russia an occupier, and it will  give you gas, bread, and money.    [Volkova] It is precisely of pro-Russian sentiments that you  are most often accused in Tbilisi.    [Abashidze] They accuse me of all sorts of things. In just  one article I was accused of selling Ajaria to Russia and Turkey  simultaneously. I ask: Which part am I selling to Russia and  which to Turkey? We have been called all sorts of names in  Georgia.    The fact that we are at peace is most important for business  contacts between Russia and Georgia, and Georgia's constituent  part, Ajaria.    [Volkova] You get the sense that there are no anti-Russian  feelings here. Neighbors live together as neighbors. There are  many streets with Russian names -- Lermontov Street, Pushkin  Street, and so forth.    [Abashidze] We live together as one family, just as we  always did, taking this communist slogan as our own. When the  order came to use only Georgian, on Ajarian television we  instantly set up Russian-language editions of exactly the same  programs. This provoked misunderstanding among the Georgian  leadership.    We commemorated 23 February [Army Day], 8 March [Women's  Day], and Border Guards Day. On 9 May [Victory Day] we marched  with veterans to the Glory Obelisk and laid wreaths at the Tomb  of the Unknown Soldier. This was against the tide.  Anti-Russian sentiments did not get a grip on us. Of course,  some things were felt even here: There were exchanges of fire,  attacks on troop units; Major Kirillov was killed in front of  his wife and child. I issued a statement and invited his wife  to come here, offering her an apartment and money.    Some people believe that I am swimming against the tide. No.  I have always swum with the tide. And at the present time  everything keeps within certain bounds.    [Volkova] Do you not have too few rights personally, as  chairman of the Supreme Council of an autonomous republic, to  make independent decisions? Does this not have an effect on  business contacts between Ajaria and Russia?    [Abashidze] This does not depend on us alone. This also  depends on our partners. Yes, I am the leader of an autonomous  republic, but nothing has prevented me from making very bold  decisions and assuming responsibility. Of course, I have seen  no steps to meet me halfway. Neither inside Georgia, nor abroad.    For instance, I go to Moscow. I want to step off the  gangway. A border guard climbs onto the gangway and checks my  passport. I have a Soviet passport. There are no new passports  either in Russia or in Georgia. I tell him: Why are you  checking, we have the same passports. He felt awkward and did  not look me in the eye. And what happened next was this. The  inspectors -- two women -- moved aside. We had been waiting,  thinking that they would begin to search us. But they say:  What are you waiting for, pass through, for God's sake. You  know, a ballad should be written about these women. Two women  protested the leadership's decision, which forcibly separates  us. It is pitiful.    For example, under the former Georgian leadership I received  orders to make an inventory of the Russian garrison's property.  But not only did I not do this, I even gave orders to shoot to  kill anyone who approached the Russian unit. I knew I was  making the right decision. And time proved this to be true.  They did not help us to arm our own Ministry of Internal  Affairs, which defended the interests of Russian troops here.  But they handed out weapons to those who attacked the units of  the Transcaucasus Military District. It is obvious why. But  all the same we did not quit this road, knowing that afterward  the Georgian central authorities would see that we were right.  Which is what happened.    We concluded a treaty independently with Udmurtia. And the  Georgian central press wrote about this: Why is Abashidze going  to Udmurtia? They have got guns there, surface-to-air missiles,  and so forth. They draw their own conclusions: We are arming  ourselves, they say. But if you are worried who will think or  say what about you, you won't achieve anything useful. We make  our own decisions, the ones we need. And time will judge us.    There are very many artificial barriers and borders. Have  you seen border guards mounting gangways and checking flights  from Moscow in our country? No. I made the decision  autonomously: Let them recognize that all this separation is  artificial.    We do not get the Russian press in Ajaria. We went to Moscow  to purchase newspapers in order to distribute them at home --  let people read, let them know what is happening in Russia, our  age-old neighbor. We were greeted rapturously in the Russian  Ministry of Communications. We agreed that we would  systematically import the press to Ajaria. We paid for the  plane at the airport. But they did not let it take off. They  told us: "You are allowed 10 newspapers. That is all." The  print runs of the papers we bought are now lying somewhere in  our friend's dacha.    Barricades have been erected on all sides.    [Volkova] This winter kiwi fruit, pineapples, bananas, and  oranges from overseas countries were sold in Moscow. But we  have not seen mandarins, oranges, or green vegetables from  Ajaria. Why not? Surely it was not impossible to sell  something from the last harvest to Russia and earn some money at  least?    [Abashidze] Unfortunately not. The railroad was blocked  off. We chartered several ships and exported citrus fruits. We  made several trips. But that is only part of the harvest.  Citrus fruits are a highly perishable commodity. One train was  detained for around a month in Tbilisi and the freight rotted.    [Volkova] You are in a bad way as regards raw materials.  Are you managing to establish contacts with Russian procurement  agents?    [Abashidze] Some stuff reaches us somehow or other by  roundabout routes, and enterprises are able to work to 20-30  percent of capacity. But, of course, these are not the contacts  which used to exist and which we need. For instance, we have  the only plant in the former Union which produced transformers  for everyone. We have a tung-oil refinery which produces  high-quality oil from this subtropical product. It is used in  aviation and the shipbuilding industry. These oils are highly  stable and irreplaceable. We always used to sell them in the  Soviet Union. Now Russian aviators and others get hard currency  from the state and buy this oil abroad at three times the price.  And we have barrels of it. We have the only caffeine plant in  the former Soviet Union. Your pharmacology and medicine are  also evidently suffering. And many similar things as well. The  Western market will not take our products. Here is an example:  We were unable to put together two wagonloads of citrus fruits  of the same size. In the past you and I lived together as  follows: We grew fruit however it would grow, we bought  whatever was on sale. We talked a different language to the  Western world; we lived on a different planet. Now we must  climb into the same boat, called the market, together and learn  together. We will fail if we go our separate ways.    We wanted to purchase sugar; a businessman came, took the  money, and left. They say to us, Interpol can find him, if you  pay $50,000 per day. Pay for 10 days, and there's the stolen  sum. And you still won't know whether Interpol will find him.    But if someone deceived you in Russia, you could phone him  and give him a dressing down: You made a mess -- clear it up.    Here is a surprising fact which we have underrated: Right  now you can phone any point in Russia or Central Asia from any  of our telephones and say: I am the director of a plant, the  unit you sold me has malfunctioned. And people will come here  from Russia, they will pay no attention to these transparent  borders or borders of reinforced concrete. We lived together --  that is what we are used to. It is like in the movies -- "Bound  by One Chain."    Russia needs Georgia like the air it breathes. And I think  that Georgia needs Russia just as much.</p>

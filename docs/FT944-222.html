			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Stanhope takes advice on trading Stanhope, the property developer headed by Mr Stuart Lipton, was last night still in limbo - a week after its banks decided not to extend its credit facilities. The group is understood to have taken legal advice about continuing trading, pending the outcome of negotiations with its bankers, advisers and other companies which have proposed rescue schemes. Stanhope appears to have benefited from the near-shutdown of normal business over the holiday period, which will have reduced outgoings. Some liabilities might also be met from funds held by the company. The 16 banks, led by Barclays, appear to have taken a sympathetic stance - at least temporarily. 'We are trying to be accommodating while there is a possibility of a solution,' said a source closed to the talks. Rescue proposals from British Land, the property investment company, and from PostTel, the post and tele communications pension fund, were rejected last week by the banks. However, talks with British Land have since reopened. Separately it emerged that Credit Lyonnais, France's lossmaking state-owned bank, has held talks with possible buyers - including British Land - about the sale of its 20 per cent stake in Forum des Halles, the landmark shopping complex in the centre of Paris. Union des Assurances de Paris, France's largest insurer which holds 12.5 per cent of Forum des Halles, is considered another possible candidate for the stake. Credit Lyonnais is in the midst of an aggressive asset-disposal programme, aimed at strengthening its balance sheet and curbing losses which totalled FFr6.9bn (Pounds 810m) in 1993 and FFr4.5bn for the first half of this year. Industry observers estimated that its 20 per cent stake in Forum des Halles is valued in excess of FFr200m.</p>

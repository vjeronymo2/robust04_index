			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / A fresh chapter in print: The background to the flotation of Mirror Group Newspapers For Mr Robert Maxwell, the international media baron, the flotation of his UK tabloid Mirror Group Newspapers, announced yesterday, is something of a hat-trick. Mr Maxwell's empire has been built on three pillars: the Pergamon publishing company, Maxwell Communication (MCC) and the Mirror group. Last month he sold Pergamon to the Dutch group Elsevier; in three months he resigns from the MCC board; and now the Mirror group is going public. Whatever the 67-year-old Mr Maxwell has in mind with all this, it is certainly not retirement. Though he is leaving the board of the publicly-quoted MCC, he remains the controlling shareholder and is installing his son Kevin in his place. Another son, Ian, will be his deputy at Mirror group. Asked yesterday why he intended to retain a majority holding of Mirror group after flotation, Mr Maxwell termed that a silly question. 'I will not,' he said, 'so long as I am alive, be in a public company in which I or my family have less than 51 per cent. I learned my lesson from Pergamon' (of which he briefly lost control in the late 1960s). In which case, it might fairly be asked why Mr Maxwell wants to return to the public arena at all. The answer may never be known in detail: for such a high-profile figure, Mr Maxwell has a remarkable talent for secrecy. Part of the answer, though, can be summed up in one word: debt. It is impossible to be precise here, since Mr Maxwell's public and private finances are inextricably entwined and his private affairs, as he will forcefully tell the enquirer, are his own business. But at the root of it lies MCC's Pounds 1.5bn acquisition of the US publisher Macmillan in 1988. Like his rival Mr Rupert Murdoch, Mr Maxwell was swept up in the rush for media assets in the late 1980s. Like Mr Murdoch, he borrowed hugely to pay for them. And like Mr Murdoch, he nearly came to grief as a result. Late last year, MCC had to come up with Pounds 210m of short-term debt repayment. Most of the money was produced by the simple expedient of selling assets from Mr Maxwell's public pocket - MCC - into his private one, Mirror group. This left Mirror group heavily borrowed. Indeed, the balance sheet as it now stands shows almost no tangible net worth at all. Of the proceeds of the forthcoming flotation, Pounds 210m is to be devoted to debt repayment. The investing public, in other words, is being asked to help pay for Macmillan at one remove. It cannot be denied, though, that Mr Maxwell's peculiar financial arrangements have given him a certain flexibility. Mr Murdoch came up against the same crisis of debt repayment at around the same time last year and had to throw himself on the mercy of his bankers. As Mr Maxwell pointedly remarked yesterday, 'you will notice that Mr Maxwell has not been having any meetings with his bankers. My next meeting will be in October 1992'. On the assumption that the flotation and the Pounds 440m sale of Pergamon finally put Mr Maxwell's finances back on an even keel, it is a good time to take stock of his empire. The best place to start is the Pergamon publishing business, which formed the empire's foundation. There can be no question that Pergamon represents a significant achievement. It was founded on the perception - simple with hindsight, like all the best ideas - that academic and scientific journals represent an ideal commercial marriage between contributors who write for free and subscribers who pay in advance. Elsevier, which has just bought Pergamon, is one of the shrewder European publishing houses. Its price of Pounds 440m therefore represents the best evidence of Mr Maxwell's ability to create value from scratch. The history of MCC is perhaps a little more chequered. Its roots lie in the old British Printing Corporation, which Mr Maxwell took on when it was on the point of collapse in 1981. Mr Maxwell is wont to claim as his proudest achievement the rescue of the UK printing industry. There is a degree of exaggeration here - for example, he relied partly on plans laid down by others - but his energies were vital to the project's success. But almost all of this was jettisoned in 1988 to raise cash for the acquisition of Macmillan and Official Airline Guides in the US. This was neither a rescue nor building from scratch, but an exercise - characteristic of the late 1980s, though on the whole uncharacteristic of Mr Maxwell - in gaining control of businesses built up by others and using other people's money to do it. The result of this has been mixed, in stock market terms particularly. Those who had bought shares in the near-bankrupt BPC at the time of the rescue would have profited handsomely. But since the mid-1980s, the share price performance of the renamed MCC has been fairly catastrophic. In the past few weeks, ahead of the Mirror flotation, they have produced a remarkable and slightly mysterious recovery. Even so, they have lost half their value relative to the UK market since their peak in 1984. That leaves the Mirror itself, whose recovery under Mr Maxwell is detailed below. Here again, as with BPC, Mr Maxwell's achievement is undeniable. Judging by the prospectus, the business is running at a fair pitch of efficiency; though for investors, of course, this raises the obvious question of how much scope there still is for rapid growth in profits. At present, Mr Maxwell is engaged in his latest high-profile rescue, that of the New York Daily News. Very probably, he will succeed at that as well. Given the history of achievement, the question naturally arises of why he remains such a distrusted figure in British commercial life, so remote from the establishment centre. The answer given by Mr Maxwell himself at yesterday's press conference - that the British hate success - does not bear inspection. The real reason probably has more to do with Mr Maxwell's highly complex personality: the secrecy, the deviousness and the refusal to conform to expected behaviour. His sons appear much more conventional figures, so perhaps the Maxwell empire will form part of the establishment in the long run. British commercial life will be the duller for it.</p>

			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Marling ends year Pounds 0.7m in the black Marling Industries yesterday reported it had ended the year in the black and said it was joining the small number of UK companies to make a distribution to shareholders in the form of a foreign income dividend. The industrial textiles company is taking advantage of the new regulations aimed at alleviating the tax burden on businesses which have a strong bias towards overseas profits. Mr William Rollason, finance director, said the saving of Pounds 200,000 in advance corporation tax on conventional dividends would be passed on to shareholders in the form of a higher dividend. A final pay-out of a net 0.57p has been recommended, making a total of 0.77p (0.65p), on a capital base increased 10 per cent by a rights issue last July. The increased dividend will compensate non-tax paying institutional shareholders which would have clawed back the ACT on conventional dividends. Under the FID scheme, companies pay dividends out of foreign income. They were devised to aid companies which suffer under the UK tax regime when their mainstream corporation tax liability was insufficient to offset their ACT liability on dividends. Announced in last year's budget, FIDs have been used by BAT Industries, the tobacco and financial services group, and Courts, the home furnishings retailer. Marling's overseas operations, which account for 90 per cent of profits, helped it return to the black with pre-tax profits of Pounds 743,000 in the year to March 31 against losses of Pounds 9.6m last time. Exceptional costs were Pounds 1.4m, compared with Pounds 8.7m which included losses on disposal of discontinued operations. Pressure on prices pushed turnover on continuing operations down from Pounds 54.7m to Pounds 48.6m. Total turnover was down 25 per cent from Pounds 79m to Pounds 59m, including Pounds 6.5m from acquisitions and Pounds 3.96m (Pounds 24.3m) from discontinued operations. Overseas operations contributed 75 per cent of sales. Marling's strongest performance came from its automotive seat belt webbing divisions in the Netherlands and Australia. Exports from Webco, its Australian offshoot, continued to grow, particularly to India, Japan, New Zealand and China. Mr David Smith, chief executive, said these markets offered longer term joint venture possibilities. Mr Smith said high organic growth was anticipated from Muller, a German manufacturer of elasticated bandages, sports bandages and incontinence products acquired in July last year. Overcapacity and pressure on prices contributed to an erosion of margins in the company's UK and German industrial webbing divisions. Gearing had risen from 84 per cent last time to 95 per cent. Mr Rollason said the target was to reduce this to 75 per cent by the end of the next financial year. Losses per share fell from 7.66p to 0.13p.</p>

			<p><P> August 14, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOTOR RACING ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> WALLACE COMES FROM FAR BACK, BUT HE WINDS UP BARELY IN FRONT  </P> <P> Rusty Wallace just kept coming back until he found himself in the lead.  </P> <P> Wallace, far behind twice, held the lead over the last 14 laps to win the  Budweiser at the Glen NASCAR race Sunday at Watkins Glen, N.Y.  </P> <P> "We came from behind so many times, it was really kind of amazing," Wallace  said. "I got caught on a caution flag and had a flat tire. We just had trouble  all day long, but we were able to overcome it."  </P> <P> A year ago, when Wallace came on strong at the end of the season to finish  second to Winston Cup champion Bill Elliott, his trademark was falling a lap or  two off the pace and coming back to win.  </P> <P> This time, he never lost a lap on the 2.48-mile, seven-turn Watkins Glen  International road course, but did come from the back of the pack.  </P> <P> "I hope we can pick up where we left off last year and win four or five in a  row," he said.  </P> <P> Wallace, who won $56,400 after averaging 89.242 m.p.h., crossed the finish line  1.06 seconds ahead of Mark Martin, with Dale Earnhardt, Davey Allison, Bobby  Hillin Jr. and Morgan Shepherd following.  </P> <P> Martin jumped past Darrell Waltrip into second place, 126 points behind  Earnhardt in the Winston Cup standings.  </P> <P> Driving what he called perhaps the best race of his career, Nigel Mansell of  England swept to victory in the Hungarian Grand Prix at Budapest.  </P> <P> It was the Briton's second win this season in his Ferrari. He started the year  by winning the Brazilian Grand Prix in March. Mansell finished the 77-lap race  in 1 hour 49 minutes 38.650 seconds.  </P> <P> "I took it easy for the first 20-30 laps," Mansell said. "I looked after the  tires, and I was able to finish the race without a pit-stop. It was a risk, but  it paid off."  </P> <P> Ayrton Senna of Brazil, in his McLaren Honda, was second, followed by Thierry  Boutsen of Belgium, in a Williams Renault. Senna, defending world champion,  trails teammate Alain Prost of France by 14 points in the standings.  </P> <P> Geoff Brabham won the Camel Grand Prix of the Heartland at Topeka, Kan., to  claim his eighth victory this season in the Camel GT series.  </P> <P> Brabham has won five of the last six series races, the streak broken in  Portland, Ore., two weeks ago when a checkered flag was waved early. The  results of that race have been appealed to the International Motor Sports Assn.  </P> <P> Brabham's average speed was 94.5 m.p.h. for the 75-lap race on the 2.5-mile  track. He came in 23 seconds ahead of teammate Chip Robinson of Oldwick, N.J.  In third place was Price Cobb of Evergreen, Colo., who drove a Jaguar XJR-9.  </P> <P> Eddie Lawson showed he will not give up his crown without a fight when he won  the Swedish 500cc Grand Prix to take the world championship lead from fellow  American Wayne Rainey at Anderstorp, Sweden.  </P> <P> Rainey crashed two laps from the finish when the rear wheel of his Yamaha slid  under him as he tried to pass Lawson's Honda and take over the lead coming out  of a bend.  </P> <P> Lawson started the race 6 1/2 points behind but his fourth win in Sweden gave  the triple world champion a 13 1/2-point lead with two races left.  </P> <P> With Rainey out of the way, Frenchman Christian Sarron finished second on a  Yamaha ahead of Lawson's Honda teammate, former world champion Wayne Gardner of  Australia.  </P></p>

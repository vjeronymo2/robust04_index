			<p><P> June 28, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> An attorney who failed to show up to testify at the preliminary hearing of  accused madam Karen Wilkening was found in contempt of court Tuesday and fined  $1,000.  </P> <P> Wesley Harris, 56, who specializes in personal injury lawsuits, allegedly was a  customer of Wilkening's call-girl ring.  </P> <P> Municipal Court Judge Fred Link entered the finding Tuesday after Judge Lisa  Guy-Schall recused herself from the case. Harris' attorney, Nelson Brav, had  requested Guy-Schall's removal, saying that she had been angered and  inconvenienced by Harris' non-appearance and that another judge should hear the  matter.  </P> <P> Guy-Schall dismissed two counts of pimping against Wilkening because of Harris'  failure to show up.  </P> <P> Harris was was subpoenaed to testify a month ago by the district attorney's  office, but, according to Brav, Harris went on a vacation that week. His  recreational vehicle broke down in Pine Valley one day, Brav said, and on the  final day of the hearing, Harris was suddenly hospitalized on his doctor's  recommendation because of high blood pressure.  </P> <P> Wilkening, 42, faces trial on Aug. 4 on prostitution charges. A separate case  is also set for Aug. 4, and prosecutors are seeking to have them tried  together.  </P></p>

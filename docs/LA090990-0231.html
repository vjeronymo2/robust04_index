			<p><P> September 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOME 'CURES' FOR 'HOME SICK' SUFFERERS  </P> <P> A key phrase operates in your tale of the Powells with "a combined income of  about $75,000" and down payment savings of about $85,000: ". . . they just  don't like most of what they see." In other words, for such people it is not  can't but won't.  </P> <P> Between can't and won't lies the compromise wisely sought by Rezowalli and Dean  who "wanted to live on the Westside" but settled for a house in Whittier.  That's the sum and substance for those who really want an affordable home.  </P> <P> I still want a home on the Westside myself. But I found advantages in a view,  privacy and seclusion where I settled near Highland Park that I never could  have dreamed of on the Westside. I don't think it's rationalization when I say  those factors have been found to be more important to my changing concepts of  quality of life for the long run.  </P> <P> RAY ARONOW  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

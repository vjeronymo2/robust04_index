			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "est": "China's Prime Minister Li Peng Will </F> Arrive With 270 Delegation Members"]    [Text] Vienna -- China's Prime Minister Li Peng and his  wife Zhu Lin will arrive on a state visit to Austria next  Thursday [30 June] with a delegation comprising 270 members,  including several government members and a high-ranking economic  delegation. This visit will "open a new chapter" in relations  with the People's Republic of China and might have an impact  "throughout the coming decade," Wang Yanyi, the new Chinese  ambassador, stated at a news conference in Vienna.    Particularly in terms of economic cooperation, there are  still "great opportunities," Ambassador Wang pointed out. It is  true that the trade volume has increased since the establishment  of official relations in 1971 by 400 million to 11.5 billion  (1993) [currency not given], but it only accounts for about 1  percent of overall foreign trade in both countries. Above all,  China is interested in Austrian technology for hydroelectric  power plants -- special Elin turbines for rivers with low water  levels, for example. Prime Minister Li Peng (65) himself  studied hydroelectric engineering in Moscow at the beginning of  the 1950's and then worked in the sphere of energy, which is  vital for China's development.    After political talks in Vienna, the Chinese prime minister  will visit the Steyr-Daimler-Puch test site near St. Valentin  and the state-owned steel works in Linz. After a visit to  Salzburg, he will travel to Germany on Sunday.    If expressed "to a moderate extent," criticism regarding the  human rights situation in China will not endanger the course of  cooperation that has been started, the Chinese side announced.  China is not only carrying out political reforms, but the legal  system is also being expanded. However, China wants to balance  reform, development, and stability. A situation like in the  former Soviet Union or the former Yugoslavia is to be avoided.</p>

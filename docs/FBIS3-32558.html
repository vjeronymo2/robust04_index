			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Quito, 9 Feb (AFP) -- The police have reported that  five policemen and 20 civilians were seriously injured today as  a result of street riots by students and workers in this  capital. Students and factory workers who were protesting the  71.2-percent increase in the price of a gallon of gasoline  confronted Army and police units with rocks and Molotov  cocktails.    On Tuesday, the Confederation of Indian Nationalities of  Ecuador [Conaie], to which 3.5 million Ecuadorans of the 11  million who live in this country belong, had initiated an  ongoing Indian uprising.    Last Thursday the powerful United Workers Front, comprised  of  the country's most important labor unions, held a national  strike to demand that the fuel price increase decreed on 28  January be repealed.    Today other popular organizations held an "empty pots and  pans march" to reject the price increase, arguing that as a  result of the government's measure food prices have increased.    The demonstrators -- including many women carrying posters,  banners, and kitchen utensils -- gathered near Central  University and at El Ejido and La Alameda parks in downtown  Quito and tried to march on the Presidential Palace, shouting  slogans against President Sixto Duran-Ballen.    Security forces, with the support of light armored tanks,  fired tear gas at the crowd to scare away the demonstrators.    Conaie has reported that in the Andean province of Azuay,  310  km southwest of Quito, the Army fired on a group of Indians,  wounding eight.    A general state of discontent is seizing the provinces of  Riobamba, Imbabura, and Carchi, on the border with Colombia,  according to journalists from those regions.    Defense Minister General Jose Gallardo has cautioned that  the  public order will be protected. Official sources have reported  that approximately 100 people were arrested in Quito for having  allegedly participated in riots.</p>

			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / Hungary looks down the Polish road: Warsaw's economic moves are attracting interest as a role model in Budapest As Hungary prepares for the return of a Socialist government, Polish voters are finding that, nine months after their own elections, the Socialist-led Polish coalition government has delivered little in the way of economic pain-relief. On the contrary, the Socialist finance minister, Mr Grzegorz Kolodko, has promised to press ahead with reforms which will cut welfare spending and focus social and pension payments more closely on the truly needy. At the same time he has promised to tighten the struggle against inflation and strengthen the institutional underpinning of the capitalist economy through the development of investment and pension funds. Market reformers in Hungary's Socialist party, led by Mr Laszlo Bekesi, its economic spokesman, would like a Socialist-led Hungarian government to follow similar policies. But the overall majority given to the Hungarian Socialists at the second round of voting last month, means that the party will be under much stronger pressure from rank-and-file voters to deliver on its electoral promises to ease the economic pain. Unlike Hungary, whose conservative post-Communist government decided to honour its inherited foreign debt obligations to the letter, Poland's former Communist government reneged on its official debt in the early 1980s and the first post-Communist government did likewise on its eventual Dollars 13bn bank debt shortly after taking power. Now the new Socialist-led Polish government is benefiting from Paris and London Club debt reduction and rescheduling accords. International bankers believe one of the risks inherent in the Hungarian election result could be pressure from below for the new government to follow Poland's example and seek some form of debt relief, a temptation absolutely rejected by Hungarian governments in the past. Thanks in part to its impeccable credit record Hungary has been the biggest recipient of foreign equity capital, more than Dollars 7bn since 1989. The new government will be extremely reluctant to put future flows at risk by changing its attitude to foreign creditors. But past borrowing has left the incoming government with a Dollars 25bn gross debt burden on the country's just over 10m inhabitants and a heavy repayment schedule. It therefore has less room for manoeuvre than the Polish government, but will probably be under greater pressure to satisfy demands for improvements in standards of living than the Polish government where responsibility is shared between coalition partners and economic growth is raising incomes across a broad front. Lower debt payments, and shock therapy reforms begun in 1990, helped Poland achieve a return to economic growth by 1993 while Hungary is still struggling to resume steady growth. Warsaw expects growth to continue at 4-5 per cent a year over the next two years and possibly accelerate if, as expected, foreign investment increases. As long as Poland's coalition partners, the PSL farmers party and the post-Communist SLD stay together, they have time to push through controversial reforms of the welfare system and still run for re-election successfully in 1997, hence their willingness to continue with tough measures now. The Polish government's economic plan for the next four years, to be unveiled in parliament shortly, includes cutting the link between pensions and average wage rises for 7m senior citizens and switching the indexation formula to a less generous inflation-linked system. It also tightens the criteria for disability pensions and unemployment benefits. The government's strategic choice to go for the long haul and avoid short-term palliatives has disillusioned many voters but cost little in real political capital. The coalition's refusal to ease monetary and fiscal policies, which it hinted at but never actually promised during the election campaign, has caused the protest vote that swung it into power to evaporate. Its core support is still there but the government is now viewed by the mass of voters as differing little from that which ran the country after 1989 when the Communist system slipped from the stage with barely a whimper. The failure of an attempt by the Solidarity trade union, now back in opposition, to get a general strike under way in April left the government feeling confident that it could ride out future discontent as it awaits the economic upswing to translate into tangible improvements for the man in the street. The benefits of tough financial and monetary policies are already becoming more apparent. For a start, Polish unemployment is beginning to fall. Registered unemployed have fallen for two months in succession to 2.9m or 13.7 per cent of the workforce, while industrial output in the first four months of the year was running 10 per cent higher than in the same period last year. Corporate profits are also improving as productivity grows and costs come under control. Industrial companies earned 9,000bn zlotys (Pounds 265m) net in the first three months of the year compared to a 1,138bn zloty net loss in the same quarter of 1993. Foreign currency reserves, at more than Dollars 4bn, also continue to grow, even though the country registered a payments deficit of Dollars 438m in the first quarter as exports continued to lag behind imports, producing a trade deficit which the government expects to continue until 1997 at least. Meanwhile, the budget deficit remains under control and inflation is falling to an expected annual rate of 25 per cent this year, down from 35 per cent in 1993. This has allowed the bank to lower base interest rates by a point or two last month. This has left the NBP confident enough to press ahead with introducing a 'hard zloty' next January. The change will erase four zeros so that one US dollar will no longer be worth around 25,000 but only 2.5 zlotys. Critics of the Polish government, however, question its performance and argue that the positive outcome of the past nine months is the result of the policies of previous Solidarity coalition government led by Ms Hanna Suchocka. They fear that the present government, led by Mr Waldemar Pawlak from the PSL farmers party and sensitive to protectionist and other claims from the powerful farmers' lobby, will sooner or later turn to more inflationary policies.</p>

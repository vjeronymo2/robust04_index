			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Busting trusts in Moscow, city of vested interests: Price rises prompt a new stress on competition Trust-busting has become the slogan of the day in Russia, even though the Anti-Monopoly Committee's remote location - on the outskirts of Moscow - is a telling indication of the insignificance attached to it until now. The sharp rise in prices following the abolition of state controls has prompted President Boris Yeltsin to demand speedy action to introduce competition in the trade sector and to stop abuses by monopoly producers and sellers. In a desperate bid to pad out the still thin domestic market, the government on Thursday abolished tariffs on all imports - at least until April 1 when new rates will be published. This means, for example, that computers and television sets can be imported free of taxes which used to range from 20 to 25 per cent. Given the freedom to set their own prices, some producers are preferring to cut back production and keep prices high. Such practice is partly the legacy of the old state-planning system, which preferred to monopolise where possible. 'It was seen as a sign of inefficiency if more than two enterprises produced the same thing,' explains Mr Valery Chernogorodsky, the anti-monopoly committee's chairman. With heavy state involvement in every sector of the economy, it is not surprising that of the 200 'abuses of dominant position' that he investigated in the last two months, half of them were committed by state officials. He said this included customs officers who refused to let importers unload their goods unless they received bribes. While demonopolising heavy industry will take time, Mr Chernogorodsky says competition can be rapidly injected into the food, services and consumer goods sectors through privatisation and the breaking up of distribution monopolies. Mr Yeltsin is soon to issue a decree lifting all restrictions on who can take part in domestic wholesale and retail trading. 'We have a lot of people who milk cows and a lot of people who drink milk, but only one organisation which is allowed to buy it from producers and sell it to the shops,' said Mr Chernogorodsky. Another task will be to combat the criminal mafia that fixes prices and decides who can sell produce at peasant markets in Moscow. The produce is plentiful, but beyond the means of most Muscovites. But as the example of Moscow illustrates, resistance to demonopolisation lies not just with factory managers, but with state officials who have traditionally run the economy at every level. Mr Yuri Luzhkov, the head of the Moscow city government, said yesterday he would work on opening the wholesale trading system in the capital. But despite a 'reform-oriented' reorganisation of the government, his deputy, Mr Vladimir Reisin, is not only retaining control over the building industry and the supply of construction materials, but also taking on responsibility for real estate.</p>

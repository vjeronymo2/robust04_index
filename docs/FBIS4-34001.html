			<p>BFN     [Text] Cartagena, Colombia, 14 Jun (AFP) -- At the  Cartagena summit, Venezuelan President Rafael Caldera spoke  about the creation of a movement to decry and fight corruption  and said that "we must punish those who rob the states' moneys  to benefit themselves." He maintained corruption is one of the  worst evils that is currently eating away at the world's  countries.    He also noted we must implement a priority program to fight  poverty in Latin America. He pointed out he advocates Cuba's  admittance into the American accord and recognized this is the  right time to revise the Ibero-American system.    President Caldera greeted the heads of state who are  attending the Cartagena summit, especially those who are about  to end their terms, and stressed that their successors "must  support and strengthen the region's integrationist and  democratic movement."    The Venezuelan president defended democracy and said that he  bases himself not only on popularity ratings but also on  macroeconomic figures that show progress is the community's  foundation for peace and harmony. He added we are "deeply  moved" as economic indicators reveal "a growth in poverty."    Caldera pleasingly admitted that international financial  institutions, such as the Inter-American Development Bank, have  recognized that the fight against poverty requires the unity of  the community and demanded industrialized nations increase  social development contributions. He added that by holding  talks we must understand that the foreign debt issue deserves a  great deal of attention because it has become a very onerous  burden for some countries. He insisted "we must find tangible  solutions to these problems."    He said "economic reactivation alone is not enough to solve  our nations' socioeconomic crises," and demanded joining efforts  "to achieve being understood and recognizing that the fight  against poverty must become a priority."    Afterwards, Caldera mentioned one of the thorniest issues of  the summit: corruption. He pointed out "corruption is one of  the most serious evils that are choking our countries" and urged  his colleagues "to commit ourselves to sanction rather than  protect those who steal official funds despicably and put our  nations in deteriorating situations."    The Venezuelan head of state noted "just as we fight against  drug trafficking, I invite you to commit ourselves to not  support and to morally and materially defeat those who commit  crimes of corruption," adding that "we are currently living hard  times" in many countries.    President Caldera admitted that summits like the Cartagena  summit "constitute a great hope" for the future. "At this  summit, I want to express my faith and hope that we will be able  to overcome the situation we are currently facing and to respond  to the terrible dilemma we are living," President Caldera  concluded.</p>

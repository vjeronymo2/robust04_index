			<p><P> January 16, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TELEVISION REVIEWS;  </P> <P> 'COVER GIRL AND THE COP': WHAT 2 WOMEN CAN DO  </P> <P> "The Cover Girl and the Cop" (at 9 p.m. on Channels 4, 36 and 39) is not the  worst TV movie ever made. It could, however, be used as an argument to make bad  television a punishable offense.  </P> <P> Julia Duffy is forced to take her vain, ditzy blond "Newhart" character a step  too far. She plays Jackie, a Vanna White-type TV celebrity, pursued by killers  because she can identify the murderer of a White House VIP.  </P> <P> Who better to protect her, and show her how to be a real woman, than tough  rookie cop Denise (Dinah Manoff of "Empty Nest"), who has a basketball net in  her apartment, calls men "scrods" and says "you're dead meat"?  </P> <P> (We can tell Denise is feminine underneath, though -- she runs over curbs when  she drives.)  </P> <P> Will Denise teach Jackie the beauty benefits of dog shampoo? When she says "act  like a real woman," will it give Jackie the confidence to dress as a man and  intimidate a bar full of thugs? Will Jackie persuade Denise to use her womanly  gifts and put on a skin-tight dress and high heels, enter a swank hotel, gather  important evidence and nail herself a wealthy boyfriend (without being mistaken  for a hooker)?  </P> <P> Duffy and Manoff are appealing, but can the plot get any dumber or more  insulting? Well, yes. You can expect lots of labored humor, chase scenes,  irrational behavior on all sides and a messy denouement in a church -- so silly  it's almost worth watching the show for.

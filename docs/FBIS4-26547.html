			<p>BFN     [Text] The Provincial Department of Radio and Television,  the Provincial Department of Culture, the Provincial  Administration for Industry and Commerce, the Provincial  Department of Public Security, the Provincial Press and  Publications Administration, and the Provincial Copyright  Administration have launched a joint inspection of the audio and  video tape markets in the Xian area. In audio-visual product  stores in the Dachengshi section of Beida District, inspectors  seized 360 pirated cassette tapes, 547 video tapes, 1,390  compact discs, and 119 laser discs. Some of these audio and  video products contained indecent material and others were  poorly produced. During the inspection, inspectors discovered  that some audio-visual product stores were operating without a  business license, while others did not have any legitimate  source of supply. The store operators did not have any  understanding of copyrights and lacked the ability to tell  genuine products from counterfeit ones.    It has been learned that, since March this year, in Xian  City  proper, the authorities have seized a substantial amount of  pirated audio-visual products, specifically, over 140,000 audio  tapes and close to 100,000 video tapes.</p>

			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: BET counts the cost Yesterday's mere Pounds 18m of full year pre-tax profits from BET - down from Pounds 322m just two years ago - is a fitting epitaph to the company's buccaneering corporate style in the late 1980s. BET, to be sure, has been feeling the full impact of recession. But a considerable chunk of last year's damage - notably the Pounds 55m above-the-line hit for written-down assets - is explained by the abandonment of accounting policies which in sunnier times had kept earnings moving nicely ahead. The problem, of course, was the way the balance sheet was sacrificed to the profit and loss account. This manifested itself not just in the form of acquisition provisions which masked outgoing expenses, but in lax cash management which needlessly piled on the debt. BET's cash outflow from operations between 1989 and March 1991 was almost Pounds 250m, a period in which net debt jumped from Pounds 98m to Pounds 425m. Last year's dash for cash was formidable by any standards, even discounting the disposals. The case for the shares rests to some extent on the new management team being able to keep this up. Assuming profits in the Pounds 125m-Pounds 150m range, another low tax charge and low capital expenditure bill, this year's cash inflow could leave the company broadly ungeared if the Auction Market Preferred Stock is counted as equity. With the finances under control - although spending on fixed assets cannot be held down for ever, especially with a tougher depreciation policy - the question is what sort of margins BET can ultimately achieve on its mix of service businesses. If the answer is 10 per cent the shares at 133p are certainly cheap. To get there, however, BET will have to rely mostly on cost cutting and productivity rather than higher prices.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News Analysis: "The U.S. Move and Its Ramifications"] </F>   [Text]  <H5>  We Are Still Holding Contacts With Christian Parties, </H5> Including the Lebanese Forces. [Signed] U.S. Ambassador Mark  Hambley    U.S. Ambassador Mark Hambley is regarded as the most active  U.S. ambassador who has served in Lebanon, in terms of official  and political meetings.    Ambassador Mark Hambley, who had previously served in Beirut  as a second-category staff member of the embassy, came to  Lebanon having served in two areas of particular importance.  Before assuming the post of consul in Alexandria, Hambley was  the U.S. charge d'affaires in Tunis.    Both Alexandria and Tunis are vital areas for the Americans.  Tunis is quite important and vital for the U.S. and Israeli  intelligence due to the strong ties between the Tunisian regime  and these intelligence services. This fact enabled both  services to monitor the Palestinian activities continuously.  Alexandria, an Egyptian town, is regarded as an extremely  important area by the Americans and Israelis, because it is  located near Libya and Palestine and overlooks the  Mediterranean. Alexandria can play a great mediation role in  the projected settlement process.    According to available information, the designation of  Hambley as U.S. ambassador in Beirut to succeed Ryan Crocker was  based on his service in Alexandria and Tunis. He came to Beirut  with a file containing ample information about the Lebanese  situation. After his arrival, Hambley formed a working team at  the embassy to conduct studies and political analyses to be  dispatched to Washington.    Knowledgeable sources view the U.S. move as indicating  exploration of the stances of all forces and parties and of  having first-hand information on the Lebanese situation.    Furthermore, Hambley's action represents a strong move into  the Lebanese domestic policy, particularly the Christians, to  reassure them that the United States supports them. This  explains Hambley's keenness on continuing contacts with the  various Christian parties, particularly the Lebanese Forces,  despite the latter's dissolution. This is interference in the  Lebanese situation, because the existing contacts between  Hambley and the Lebanese Forces one way or another represent a  rejection of the Lebanese authorities' decision to dissolve the  Lebanese Forces, and represent a U.S. attempt to buoy them up in  service of the hostile designs.    Other information indicates that ambassador Hambley is  holding continuous meetings with Christian opposition figures  and he is sending several signals to [Lebanese Forces leader]  Ja'ja'.</p>

			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / More smoke than light: Could private sector borrowing for the huge Channel tunnel project have been better managed Welcome it may be, but is it enough? That is the question worried bankers are asking as passenger revenues finally pour into Eurotunnel's coffers this week. At the time of the rights issue in May, the projected cost of servicing the Pounds 7.9bn mountain of debt raised to finance the cross-channel venture was put at Pounds 546m for 1995. Since then delays have eaten into forecast revenue, while short-term interest rates have risen. Within 12 months, after a full season of operations, it will be clear whether Eurotunnel is capable of surmounting this awesome hurdle against a deteriorating financial background. Meantime the markets are offering a provocative answer to the conundrum about the bankers' huge exposure. In the secondary market in Eurotunnel's main Pounds 6.8bn tranche of bank debt, the price quoted by a leading dealer on Friday was 55 pence in the pound for those willing to sell and 62 for would-be purchasers, against the par value of 100 at which most of the 220-odd banks involved still carry the loan on their books. The market is small in relation to the total debt. But its assessment of the prospects points to a potential write-down of just over Pounds 3bn and a large negative net worth for the company. Since the worst of the price fall came after the rights issue, the market clearly believes the slender but positive year-end cash balances projected in the rights document will be negative. Participants in this market, including bank lenders to Eurotunnel, appear not to regard the tunnel operator as financially viable in its present form. As for the equity shares, they are down more than 70 per cent from their peak and are worth a little less than when floated in 1987. The prospectus then promised a dividend yield on the offer price of 16 per cent by 1994, 34 per cent by 1998 and 60 per cent by 2003. Now 2003 is the earliest date Eurotunnel dares to forecast an initial payout. According to one battle-weary trader last week, with tongue only slightly in cheek, the market may still be 15 years too cheerful about the dividend timetable. While Eurotunnel is a splendid engineering achievement, it is hard to deny that it has been a financial fiasco so far. Could private sector financing for such a large infrastructure project have been better managed? Just possibly. In the heady banking climate of 1987 the banks would have been better advised to demand a bigger cushion of equity before advancing money. Whether it would have been available is a moot point. British institutional investors, in particular, were reluctant. And with good reason. The lessons of history are not encouraging. Indeed, the first rule of big international infrastructure project financing in the 19th century was that initial shareholders rarely emerge well. That was certainly true of Egypt and Ferdinand de Lesseps' Suez Canal project. The country lost Pounds 8m on the shares before defaulting on its loans when the canal company's revenues were insufficient to service the related debt. As for the Panama Canal, another project started by de Lesseps with private finance, it had to be completed under US government ownership. Domestic British infrastructure projects, including rail and tunnel ventures, were not uniformly disastrous in the Victorian period. Yet many, including the first tunnel under the Thames, generated rewards only for later owners, sometimes after two or three bankruptcies. This serves to underline the peculiar nature of project financing. In most normal bank-lending business, the problem for the bank is that it knows less about the project or business to be financed than the borrower. The peculiarity of much large-scale project finance is that there is symmetry in the lack of information: the borrower and lender may both be in the dark given that such projects are inevitably one-offs. Small wonder the historic record is so disheartening. In the 19th century, English financiers sought to overcome the problem by using uncalled capital. Investors were required to make an initial down-payment, and could be called upon for further capital as money was needed. The snag, apparent in the railway boom of the 1840s, was that this encouraged speculation: speculators who found themselves unable to pay would dump partly-paid shares, so depressing the market. Financiers responded with innovations such as vendor shares for contractors, and preference shares and debentures, giving secure income to investors. Today forecasting for infrastructure projects is more scientific. Yet neither Eurotunnel, the railways nor the banks really know how buoyant or otherwise revenues will be. And, ironically, the banks have unwittingly found themselves in the role of 19th century investors, since their original loan has turned out to be no more than a down-payment, followed by urgent calls from Eurotunnel for more. Meantime financiers have come up with a possible answer to the 20th century equivalent of the dumping problem. The development of secondary markets in the debt of distressed companies means - or so their proponents claim - that weak banks may not pose a threat to debt refinancing. They can pass the buck to others by selling on the debt. At Eurotunnel the market is still small. According to Mr Martin Dent, a London-based vice-president of Bankers Trust, which reckons to have the lion's share of the business, Pounds 120-130m of Eurotunnel's debt is now traded in the secondary market. The reason the trade is limited is that the sale of debt would force the banks to recognise a loss equivalent to 45 per cent of their exposure. A specific provision would then have to be made against profits. This is an odd reflection on the nature of bank provisioning, which is designed to deal with the problem of the lack of marketability of bank assets. In the absence of a market, provisions and write-offs take place only late in the day, when the loss of value is beyond dispute. Yet the development of secondary markets in the debt of distressed companies appears to make a nonsense of this traditional accounting practice. A further reproach to the accounting profession is that the trade in bank debt also reflects other forms of creative accounting. According to Gary Klesch of Klesch &amp; Company, a London-based debt broker and analyst, much of the Eurotunnel secondary market activity has been driven by banks swapping Eurotunnel debt for paper in more creditworthy financial institutions carrying a lower interest coupon. In many continental European countries, auditors allow the new debt to be put onto the books at the value of the old, despite the loss of income. The bank then has the benefit of a less risky asset that has to be backed by less regulatory capital. Some banks are now beginning to make specific provisions against Eurotunnel debt, so market activity is driven less by accountancy arbitrage than by direct sales for cash. For once the provisions have been made, the trade no longer has such unpleasant implications for the carrying value of the loan in the banks' books. The message, not for the first time, is that bank provisioning is driven more by an upturn in bank profitability than any realistic assessment of loan assets by banks and their auditors. The big question about this market, which has always worried the Bank of England, is whether new investors will be willing participants in any financial reconstruction of Eurotunnel. If the market's judgment about the value of Eurotunnel's debt is right, an important test will come soon. A serious shortfall of revenue next year would point to a stay of interest payments and a capital reconstruction, probably involving the banks in swapping debt for equity. If, as Gary Klesch and others in the market argue, new investors have an overwhelming interest in improving the company's financial position, Eurotunnel could end up with a more viable capital structure. The secondary market in debt would then take off, since the debt-equity swap would require banks to make provisions in their accounts, making it easier for them to sell out. In theory, the trade could then grow from the present Pounds 130m to a multi-billion pound market. That potential no doubt explains why big US institutions like Bankers Trust and Continental Bank are prepared to trawl in what, for the moment, is a very small pond.</p>

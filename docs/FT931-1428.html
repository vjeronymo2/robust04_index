			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / International Company News: Finnish insurer stays in the red for third year HEAVY CLAIMS from foreign and credit insurance business kept Finnish insurer Pohjola in the red for the third consecutive year in 1992, although its operating loss narrowed to FM525m (Dollars 89m) from FM588m in 1991, writes Christopher Brown-Humes. The company relied on an improved investment performance, where income rose to FM508m from FM379m, to help offset a deeper underwriting loss of FM307m, compared with FM190m. Premiums fell 5 per cent to FM3.24bn, following a 4 per cent decline in domestic premiums to FM2.84bn, and a 12 per cent drop in foreign premiums to FM407m.</p>

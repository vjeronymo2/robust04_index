			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Clarke in low-key start at Treasury MR KENNETH CLARKE, the new chancellor, took command of the Treasury yesterday and immediately closeted himself with his second-in-command and fellow cabinet member Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary. It was a low-key start for a big step in Mr Clarke's cabinet career. But some Whitehall-watchers accorded it more than usual significance. They said that if Mr Clarke could forge an alliance with the rightwing Mr Portillo, he would be the strongest minister in the government and able to reassert the Treasury's authority in Whitehall. To achieve this, however, Mr Clarke would probably have to take an even tougher line on cutting public spending than Mr Norman Lamont would have done. Mr Clarke was welcomed into the Treasury by Mr Portillo and by Sir Terence Burns, the permanent secretary, and later met senior officials. He asked for briefing papers on the key issues facing the department and will return next Wednesday, during the parliamentary recess, for a full programme of discussions on policy. Public spending is at the top of the new chancellor's agenda because difficult decisions on priorities have to be taken soon before the autumn negotiations with spending ministries get under way. Mr Clarke impressed officials with his practical approach to problems. One said that he doubted whether he had arrived at the Treasury 'with life all worked out'. Others, while regretting the nature of Mr Lamont's departure, were looking forward to the return of a political heavyweight to 11 Downing Street. Although Mr Clarke has never worked as a Treasury minister he has experience of economic issues. He shared in the decision to take sterling out of the European exchange rate mechanism and was a member of the EDX committee of ministers which pushed through last year's tight spending round. In the mid-1980s he was a member of the 'star chamber' committee charged with pruning excess public expenditure and won admiration from Treasury officials for his determination to keep spending under control. Yesterday saw the departure from the Treasury of Mr Rupert Darwall, one of Mr Lamont's political advisers. It is expected that Mr Bill Robinson, Mr Lamont's senior adviser who was brought into the Treasury in 1991 from the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies to help with tax reform, will leave soon. Mr Clarke will be bringing Ms Tessa Keswick and Mr David Ruffley from the Home Office to spearhead his personal staff. Speculation on other moves in the Treasury centred on Mr Jeremy Heyward, Mr Lamont's 30-year-old private secretary. Mr Heyward has had a meteoric career in the Treasury under Mr Lamont's wing. He was also private secretary to Mr Lamont when he was financial secretary and chief secretary at the Treasury. Mr Heyward's subsequent move to head the former chancellor's private office raised a few eyebrows among older officials, who saw it as too big a promotion. He is thought to be due for a move because of the strains of the private office job. Other changes in the Treasury are likely to be limited, at least until plans for the unified Budget in November have been completed. Possible contenders for Mr Heyward's job are Mr Adam Sharples and Mr Jim Hibberd, officials who are more senior than Mr Hayward was when he got the job. Generally, Mr Clarke's move to the Treasury has been welcomed. One official said: 'We are pleased that he is coming. We are talking about a set of employees who have been extremely depressed for a long time, especially since the devaluation of the pound.'</p>

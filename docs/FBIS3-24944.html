Mr Mandela arrived at the club and greeted staff before  telling his predominantly white audience his welcome at the club  was a sign of the times -- especially in light of the  relationship between the petrol from oil giant and the ANC's  armed wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation] (which has  attacked its installations in the past).    Asked to comment on this week's National Party federal  congress, the ANC leader said: "What is there to say about a  party on its way out? The National Party is still a racist  party." He requested business people to trust the ANC as its  policy mirrored the basic aspirations of all South Africans.    He added the ANC was not out to run a campaign of revenge  against the people who had jailed party leaders, but rather  wanted all South Africans to work together. The country's  economy had become stangnant due to years of apartheid and it  was up to the ANC and the people of South Africa to stimulate  growth.    "We would like all of you, especially white businessmen, to  help achieve this. We all have a common loyalty to South Africa  and we all want to live in peace."    Turning to the spate of sabotage attacks on the offices and  homes of ANC aligned people and organisations in the [Orange]  Free State, Mr Mandela told his audience: "They (ANC homes and  offices) are being bombed by people who are demanding to cling  to apartheid...It is our people being killed by the right  wing...By security organisations and by other black groups...But  the whites in this country are totally silent. When there is  violence it is sparked off by the right wing and is tolerated by  the De Klerk government. Without peace we are not going to get  investment from abroad."    Mr Mandela added money was being taken out of the country  because of the violence. If a right wing inspired civil war  broke out, it was not only blacks who would be killed. Whites  were destroying the future of their children by not acting  stongly enough on the violence sweeping the country.</p>

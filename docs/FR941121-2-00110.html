The DOT is interested in working with several of the selected partnerships to evaluate new approaches that: (1) Speed up the process for executing an ITS partnership agreement; (2) provide for innovative procurement methods; or (3) provide for innovative financing strategies. Specifically, the DOT's support may include:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Administrative assistance to facilitate initial cooperation and communication among the project participants during the preagreement process. The intent is to involve all project participants, including contractors and subgrantees, as well as contract, technical, and legal staff of the project partners.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Funding assistance to State and local governments to conduct innovative procurements and expedite the procurement process, particularly for complex, highly technical systems, in connection with the test. This assistance may include development of an acquisition plan, preparing statements of work and other contract documents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Funding assistance for the legal and consulting services and other costs necessary to implement new funding approaches, such as user fees, franchise fees, or use of venture capital to leverage private investment in ITS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Interested offerors are requested to indicate their willingness to participate in any of these initiatives and provide additional information to support the decision for selection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Evaluation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Evaluation is an integral part of each operational test and critical to the success of the National ITS Program. The DOT Operational Test Evaluation Guidelines, dated November, 1993, provides information on established guidelines and methodology for the evaluation of operational tests. Persons wishing to obtain a copy of the DOT Operational Tests Evaluation Guidelines are directed to the first FHWA individual named above under the heading, FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The evaluation guidelines, that shall apply to all operational tests funded in whole or part with Federal ITS funds, are as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Individual operational tests will be structured within and have objectives which are consistent with the DOT's Program Plan for ITS. This will guide the development of the evaluation goals of each operational test.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The DOT will perform the role of evaluation coordinator for all operational tests. As evaluation coordinator, the DOT or its agent will work with the other partners in establishing individual test objectives, including the national, as well as local, goals and objectives that must be addressed during the evaluation; in developing the overall evaluation plan and the detailed experimental design; and in conducting the actual evaluation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The DOT will conduct the evaluation or require that it be conducted by an independent party who is not a member of the partnership responsible for the operational test. The DOT reserves the right to conduct any additional evaluation deemed necessary to satisfy the national objectives of the ITS Program. Where the evaluation is conducted by a party retained by the non-Federal partners, the DOT shall retain approval authority to ensure the evaluation is acceptable and unbiased.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. The ITS Partnership Agreement or other documents used to establish the operational test and funding arrangements between the DOT and the other partners will include language to require that an evaluation plan be prepared in the early phases of the operational test. There will also be language in all the agreements that incorporates the provisions of these guidelines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. The operational test funding plan shall separately account for the evaluation phase. Funds identified for the test evaluation shall not be spent for other portions of the operational tests. The DOT shall negotiate with the other partners during the initial operational test definition to ensure an adequate estimate of the funding necessary to meet the national evaluation objectives.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Funding to proceed with detailed systems design and implementation for the operational test shall not normally be provided until an evaluation plan has been approved by the DOT. Subsequent approval stages will be specified in the ITS Partnership Agreement to ensure adequate development of the test and its evaluation. Funding for each test may be provided incrementally to allow for the adequate completion of each of the defined milestones.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Nothing in these guidelines shall preclude the non-Federal partners from conducting additional evaluations for their specific needs. The non-Federal partners are expected to be involved in specific phases of the evaluation. At a minimum, the non-Federal partners are expected to be part of the process to develop the goals and objectives of the test and the overall evaluation plan. These partners will also be involved in much of the technical, legal, and institutional data collection, archiving, and reporting.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / SNP gathers in good spirits after summer of successes The Scottish National party gathers in Inverness for its annual conference today with the spirits of its supporters high after a summer of electoral successes. The party has established itself as the second party in Scottish politics after Labour and the conference is intended to outline to party members what policies an independent Scotland governed by the SNP and within the European Union would pursue. Delegates will also hear the party's campaigning strategy for the years up to the next general election, following on from its successes in this year's regional and European elections. The SNP won nearly 33 per cent of the Scottish vote in the European elections, its highest level ever, and it added the North East Scotland seat to its Highlands constituency. In May it took control of two of Scotland's nine regional councils for the first time. However, it narrowly failed to defeat Labour in the Monklands East by-election at the end of June, in spite of a sharp rise in its vote. The party's standing in the Scottish opinion polls has fallen back since July when it reached a six-year peak of 30 per cent. A System Three opinion poll at the beginning of September put the SNP on 24 per cent, well behind Labour on 55 per cent but far ahead of the Conservatives on 12 per cent and the Liberal Democrats on 8 per cent. Support for Labour in Scotland surged both after the death in May of John Smith and later with the election of Mr Tony Blair as its leader. But the SNP is portraying Mr Blair as a soft socialist who will adapt Labour's policies to the wishes of the people of southern England rather than those of the north. The party is celebrating its 60th anniversary with a conference agenda which contains few seriously controversial issues. The highlight is likely to be the speech on Friday of Mr Alex Salmond, the party's leader.</p>

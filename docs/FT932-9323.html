			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / Junk mail sent in Revenue post MAILINGS of Inland Revenue information for employers, sent out for the first time this year by contractors, included junk-mail advertising, the top civil servants' union said yesterday. Ms Elizabeth Symons, general secretary of the First Division Association, told the union's annual conference that one employer received a car-parts catalogue, a travel brochure, a guide to Tote betting, a leaflet from an Islamic pressure group and a woman's skirt in his tax mailing. The claim follows an admission last month by Sir Anthony Battishill, chairman of the Inland Revenue board, that the mailings, which included information about individual taxpayers, had been sent to the wrong addresses. The Revenue yesterday confirmed that there had been reports of 'extraneous materials' in the mailing, but said there was no evidence that this was more than the odd item inserted by mistake. It said that the misaddressing of packs had arisen in the transfer of computerised information from the Revenue to the main contractor. The mailing, sent to 1.25m employers before the start of the tax year, included instructions on operating the pay-as-you-earn system and PAYE codes for new employees.</p>

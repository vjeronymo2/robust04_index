			<p><P> October 19, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PACIFIC 10 / MAL FLORENCE;  </P> <P> JAMES PLAYING DOWN ROSE BOWL PROSPECTS  </P> <P> It's understandable that Washington players and fans are talking about the Rose  Bowl, considering that the Huskies are the only Pacific 10 team that hasn't  lost a conference game (3-0) and have a favorable schedule in their remaining  five games.  </P> <P> However, Coach Don James is trying to put a lid on such optimism.  </P> <P> James is mindful that the Huskies had 3-0 Pac-10 records four times in the  1980s and didn't go to the Rose Bowl.  </P> <P> "I try to be polite," James said, referring to people who are prematurely  congratulating his team. "I just thank them and try to change the subject."  </P> <P> The players, though, aren't as reticent.  </P> <P> "I've said all along that this can be a great team. We can get to the Rose  Bowl," offensive guard Dean Kirkland said. "We've got a mean defense and a mean  offense. We'll go hats-on-hats with you and beat you."  </P> <P> Sophomore quarterback Mark Brunell said: "We're getting better every game. I  know I'm feeling more comfortable and confident."  </P> <P> There are reasons for optimism:  </P> <P>  -- The Huskies lead the nation in rushing defense, allowing opponents an  average of 47.5 yards a game on the ground.  </P> <P>  -- Tailback Greg Lewis is the conference's leading rusher, averaging 135.5  yards a game. He averaged 7.3 yards a carry in a 38-17 victory over Oregon last  Saturday in Seattle.  </P> <P>  -- In three conference games, Washington has outscored opponents, 111-31, and  outgained them by an average of 459 yards to 215 yards.  </P> <P> Washington will play Stanford at Palo Alto Saturday and has only one road game  remaining thereafter, its annual regular-season-ending Apple Cup battle against  Washington State at Pullman, Wash., on Nov. 17.  </P> <P> The Huskies will play California, Arizona and UCLA at home.  </P> <P> "The thing that makes it so great is that the whole team is playing well,"  defensive tackle Steve Emtman said. "It just isn't two or three guys. Everybody  is making big plays."  </P> <P> Although Fred Schweer Jr. led Oregon State to a 35-21 upset over Arizona last  Saturday at Corvallis, Ore., Coach Dave Kragthorpe hasn't designated him as the  No. 1 quarterback.  </P> <P> "Fred Schweer started because Matt Booher was injured," Kragthorpe said. "I  feel very comfortable about our quarterback position and I am not concerned  about who starts against Washington State (Saturday in Corvallis)."  </P> <P> Schweer, from Woodbridge High School in Irvine, is a redshirt freshman. His  father was a running back for the Beavers in 1964-65.  </P> <P> The 35 points scored by the Beavers against the Wildcats were the most for  Oregon State since it was beaten by WSU, 45-42, in 1979.  </P> <P> Oregon State lost nine fumbles in its first three games, but only one in its  last three.  </P> <P> Arizona seems to have problems getting up for the "little games."  </P> <P> In 1980, the Wildcats lost to Washington State, 38-14, at Tucson. The Cougars  finished in a tie for eighth place in the conference.  </P> <P> The Cougars defeated the Wildcats the next year, winning, 34-19, in Tucson. Two  weeks earlier, Arizona had upset previously unbeaten USC, 13-10, at the  Coliseum.  </P> <P> In 1987, Arizona tied Cal, 23-23, and lost to WSU, 45-28. The Bears and Cougars  finished eighth and ninth, respectively, in the Pac-10.  </P> <P> Last year, the Wildcats had beaten Oklahoma, Washington and UCLA, among other  schools, before losing to Cal, 29-28. The Bears wound up in last place in the  conference.  </P> <P> Pacific 10 Notes  </P> <P> Oregon Coach Rich Brooks, on Washington: "Defensively, they are just  light-years ahead of where they were. Everywhere you look, they're all over on  defense. They just obliterate opponents' running games. And Greg Lewis is a  great running back, the best we've seen. Right now, they clearly have the best  team in our conference." . . . Oregon cornerback Muhammad Oliver suffered a  season-ending knee injury against the Huskies. Moreover, quarterback Bill  Musgrave has a pulled abdominal muscle and is listed as doubtful for Saturday's  game against Arizona State at Eugene, Ore. . . . The sound of music: Columnist  Mark Purdy of the San Jose Mercury-News tuned in on the USC marching band last  Saturday at Stanford. He estimated that it played "Conquest" 53 times.  Considering that the Trojans haven't lost to the Cardinal since 1975, Purdy  figures that Stanford has had to endure "Conquest" 795 times since last beating  USC. . . . Washington has won 10 of its last 11 games against Stanford.  </P></p>

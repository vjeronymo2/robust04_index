			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Captain 2nd Rank Yuriy Kondratyev: "The </F> Guardsmen Have Arrived to Maintain Order"]    [Text] The first subunits of a special battalion of the  National Guard of Ukraine have arrived in Sevastopol.    The Center for Civil Liaison of the Ukrainian Armed Forces  of  the city has reassured Sevastopol residents, by announcing that  the chief tasks of the National Guardsmen will be the protection  of the constitutional system of Ukraine, work in conjunction  with internal-affairs bodies, and assistance to the Border  Troops in apprehending violators of the state border.    The decision to station subunits of the National Guard in  all  oblast and equivalent cities of Ukraine was made in 1993. The  soldiers of the battalion will take part, in the near future, in  measures planned by the Ukrainian Armed Forces in Sevastopol to  protect civic order.    The leadership of the Directorate of Internal Affairs  expressed the hope that the transfer of the National Guard  subunits to the city will promote a preservation of the trend  toward stability in civic order that has been noted in  Sevastopol.    It only remains to add that the battalion of National  Guardsmen is commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Ihor Kurovskyy, and  that its size at the end of May was 351 men.</p>

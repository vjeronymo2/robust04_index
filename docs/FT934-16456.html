			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Walker Greenbank at Pounds 3.4m as demand picks up INTERIM pre-tax profits at Walker Greenbank rose from Pounds 1.89m to Pounds 3.35m as demand for domestic wall coverings began to pick up early this summer followed by an increase in commercial orders. The comparison was flattered, however, by the restatement of the year earlier figure to reflect new accounting standards. One-off items netting out to a charge of Pounds 393,000 were increased to Pounds 1.19m, mainly because of the treatment of property disposals. Operating profits from continuing activities in the six months to July 31 rose to Pounds 3.54m (Pounds 3.38m) on flat sales of Pounds 29.9m (Pounds 29.5m). 'We definitely see a gradual underlying improvement in the UK. We see economic recovery coming through on to the bottom line,' said Mr Charles Wightman, the chief executive. He added: 'The turn on the consumer side came last summer, but I think it has been particularly marked in the last four or five months. The recovery is stronger on the consumer side, but it is present in the commercial side too and it is sustained.' He believed the improved trading picture partly reflected the company's increasing market share. Walker Greenbank has about 10 per cent of the total UK market in wall coverings, but 60 per cent of the UK market for commercial wall coverings. He said overseas sales were growing by about 30 per cent but from a low base. The company's acquisition in April of John Hartley, the Yorkshire-based furniture upholstery fabrics company, contributed Pounds 752,000 to sales but turned in an operating loss of Pounds 12,000. 'Hartley's has now traded profitably for the last three months,' Mr Wightman said. He said the company had anticipated that the Pounds 1.6m acquisition, which was funded by a Pounds 2.7m share placing, would not affect earnings per share, but now thought it might enhance earnings this year. The placing had helped strengthened the balance sheet and interest charges dropped to Pounds 181,000 (Pounds 301,000). The company had borrowings of Pounds 2m (Pounds 6m) at the halfway stage giving gearing of 6.6 per cent (23.8 per cent). It expects to be virtually ungeared by the year end. The interim dividend is held at 1.2p with the board aiming to reach dividend cover of 2 times. Earnings per share rose to 2.44p against a restated 1.08p.</p>

			<p><P> December 18, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GORBACHEV CALLS FOR REFERENDUM ON SOVIET UNITY  </P> <P> President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, battling to hold the Soviet Union together  through an ever-deepening political and economic crisis, called Monday for a  national referendum to decide whether the nation's constituent republics will  join to form a new federal state or break away.  </P> <P> Warning that the Soviet Union's very existence is now imperiled, Gorbachev  said: "In going away from extreme centralization, we must not allow the union  to be turned into something amorphous or to disintegrate. This would hit hard  at the destinies of millions of people and at the whole world."  </P> <P> Gorbachev, acknowledging the growing chaos across the country, also asked the  Congress of People's Deputies, the national Parliament, to approve a series of  constitutional amendments restructuring the Soviet government and increasing  his powers.  </P> <P> "If we have strong government, tight discipline and control over the  implementation of our decisions, then we shall be able to ensure normal food  supplies, rein in crime and stop interethnic strife," Gorbachev said. "The most  important thing now in overcoming the crisis is to enforce order in the  country," he added.  </P> <P> "If we fail, then deepening discord, a rampage of dark forces and the  disintegration of the state become inevitable."  </P> <P> To deal with the economic crisis, Gorbachev sketched a series of further  reforms intended first to stabilize the fragmenting Soviet economy and then to  shift it gradually from state ownership and central planning to free enterprise  and market forces, but they appeared to delay more than accelerate the changes.  </P> <P> The Soviet president described the present food shortages in Moscow, Leningrad  and other major industrial centers as among the gravest of the country's  problems. It results from "the unprecedented breakdown in mutual deliveries of  goods between regions, the disruption of economic ties and the collapse of all  normal relations between cities and the countryside," he said.  </P> <P> "What is happening now is not simply insufficient output. It is a consequence  of disorder, lack of control, criminal negligence and irresponsibility toward  the people. . . . The indignation among the people is reaching the critical  level."  </P> <P> Assessing the overall state of the nation, Gorbachev has never been more stark,  and he acknowledged that the increasing criticism of his leadership by many  here has been correct.  </P> <P> "The current situation in the country is grave," he said. "The crisis continues  to deepen in the national economy, in political and social spheres and  especially in interethnic relations. Stability and public order have been  undermined. Each citizen, every family, workers and the entire country feel  these effects. Society is greatly concerned about today and the future.  </P> <P> "More and more the question is being asked whether the line toward perestroika  has been chosen correctly. Are we following the right beacons and striking to  achieve the right goals? Have we swerved off course? We are living through a  truly critical moment. The great cause that we embraced five years ago and that  has created conditions for a deep transformation of the country and the entire  world is now under an obvious threat."  </P> <P> Yet with this acknowledgement of the country's problems, the admission that his  own errors had contributed to them and a call for "discipline, civil accord and  selfless work," Gorbachev sought to rally the country out of what is perhaps  its greatest crisis -- a crisis of confidence in his leadership, in  perestroika, as his reforms are known, and in itself.  </P> <P> "We should neither give up ourselves nor scare other people with talk of  impending catastrophe," he said at the conclusion of his hourlong address to  the congress.  </P> <P> In an appeal to conservatives, first of all, Gorbachev promised to take the  "most resolute actions without delay" as president to pull the country out of  the crisis.  </P> <P> "It is not a question of reverting to the long-condemned and rejected methods  of unlimited dictatorship and arbitrariness," he said. "What I mean is power  acting on the basis of law and capable of ensuring stability and civil peace  and thus overcoming the crisis."  </P> <P> Even before Gorbachev spoke, a deputy from the Communist Party, which Gorbachev  heads, called for a vote of no confidence in him and sought his replacement as  president.  </P> <P> "Mikhail Sergeyevich (Gorbachev) has no moral right to lead the country any  longer," declared Sazhi Umalatova, 37, a foreman at a machine tool factory and  a member of the Supreme Soviet, the country's legislature. "You brought  devastation, hunger, cold, blood and tears. Innocent people are perishing."  </P> <P> Her resolution was excluded from the agenda of the session, 1,288 votes to 426,  but the support it did gain demonstrated the discontent with Gorbachev among  the deputies, who were elected in 1989 and have generally done his bidding.  </P> <P> Gorbachev faced further criticism, even from his supporters, as deputies began  to debate his proposals Monday afternoon. More than 430 deputies have asked to  speak in the debate. The congress, scheduled to last 10 days, was convened to  approve the draft "union treaty" and to amend the Soviet constitution to  provide for a presidential system of government.  </P> <P> Nursultan Nazarbayev, the president of the Central Asian republic of Kazakhstan  and a possible Gorbachev nominee for the new post of Soviet vice president,  called for faster, more radical economic reforms rather than the government's  planned stabilization program.  </P> <P> Yuri Blokhin, the leader of the conservative Soyuz group, castigated  perestroika for bringing the country to the brink of collapse and leading to  the likely breakup of the Soviet Union as it is now constituted.  </P> <P> And Moscow Mayor Gavriil Popov, a radical economist, objected to increasing  Gorbachev's powers and proposed instead a political compact among the country's  republics to tackle the problems.  </P> <P> Boris N. Yeltsin, the president of the Russian Federation, the largest  republic, said that Gorbachev had brought no fresh thinking to the congress,  and he dismissed the proposed referendum as "a waste of time" because the  republics would have worked out a new set of relationships among themselves and  with the center.  </P> <P> "I expected to hear nothing new and my expectations came true," Yeltsin told  journalists. "It looks like we are returning to the diktat of the center."  </P> <P> The Russian Federation has declared its willingness to sign the new treaty, but  only if it provides for a greater decentralization of power than does the  present draft.  </P> <P> But the legislatures in the Baltic republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania  as well as in Moldova and Georgia have voted to reject the document, and  nationalist leaders in Armenia and the Ukraine have expressed serious  reservations.  </P> <P> Gorbachev described the result of the referendum in each republic as the "final  verdict" on the issue, apparently to get around nationalists who control many  of the republican legislatures, but he provided no details on how the  referendum would work.  </P> <P> "Until the new union treaty is concluded, determining the legal status of all  its participants, the supreme legislative act to be enforced unconditionally  remains the Soviet constitution," Gorbachev said.  </P> <P> He pledged that he would use his enhanced powers as president to crack down  hard on "the destructive activity of separatist and nationalist forces,"  acknowledging that his failure to move against them earlier resulted in "grave  consequences in a number of cases" where ethnic tensions flared into riots and  civil unrest.  </P> <P> He also said a "counteroffensive" would be launched against crime, particularly  gangs responsible for economic crimes. "Tough measures are needed and we will  resort to them," he said.  </P> <P> The conservative character of the speech was also clear from the promises  Gorbachev made to the police and military to uphold their honor despite  widespread criticism and to provide them with additional authority to maintain  order.  </P> <P> Gorbachev was also hard on the country's intelligentsia. Most of them were  among his most ardent supporters at the outset of perestroika but some are now  among his most caustic critics.  </P> <P> "The squandering of their energies by a significant number of intellectuals on  bickering over the past and on infighting does a disservice, helping to stir  destructive, destabilizing passions," he said.  </P> <P> "Amid the escalating crisis, the talents and knowledge of some intellectuals  have been directed not at pacifying peoples and looking for sensible approaches  to worsened problems but at fanning the flames, including in interethnic  relations where things have gone as far as open enmity, bloodshed and  confrontation between republics."  </P></p>

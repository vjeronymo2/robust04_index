State distribution targets are intended as guides rather than rigid allocations. Final state distributions may differ from these targets. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Other <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  If the jobs programs are not available until spring, some fishermen will be participating in other fisheries, and unable to participate in the program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The timing of many habitat restoration jobs will be limited by weather and biological considerations. It is intended that the habitat restoration jobs program include a broader range of projects, which may provide for jobs during all seasons. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The jobs programs are not structured to lead to permanent employment at a living wage. There is no long-term assistance for training, placement, or business startup. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The intent of the programs is to compensate fishermen for uninsured losses and not to provide long-term assistance for other employment or business opportunities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Salmon fishermen currently receiving unemployment funds and or Federally funded training should not be ineligible to participate in the habitat restoration jobs program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Salmon fishermen receiving Federal unemployment funds or Federally funded training are not precluded from receiving funds from NEAP. However, funds received for such purposes are considered compensation. The IFA provides that eligible commercial fishermen may only receive 75% of their total uncompensated and uninsured loss, and may not receive in excess of $100,000 in total Federal compensation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Why are support industries and government entities ineligible for assistance? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  NOAA acknowledges that the closure of the salmon fishery negatively impacted the recreational support industries, fish processing workers, and local governments. However, the IFA clearly provides that aid under this authority will be made available only to commercial fishermen. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Why is this program taking so long to get started? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Certain procedural steps must be undertaken to comply with the IFA and other applicable law. These steps include opportunity for public notice and comment. Also the programs need to be designed and made operational. All three programs require agreements with the administrative intermediaries who in turn must create programs and processes that comply with the NEAP. All efforts are being undertaken to expedite the assistance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Because of the recent Sonoma County, California, FEMA disaster declaration, the geographic range of the jobs programs needs to be expanded. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The listing of counties was to serve as a means of illustration of the likely counties where projects are to take place. The eligibility criteria do not require that fishermen must live in the county where the projects take place. Habitat restoration projects are geographically limited to locations within close commuting distance of commercial fishermen as defined under this action. However, for sake of completeness Sonoma County will be specifically mentioned as well as the counties bordering on the tributaries of the Columbia River. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Changes From the Proposed Program <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In response to comments, NMFS has made substantive changes to NEAP, from the proposed program, to provide added opportunity and flexibility for participation by fishermen impact by the disaster. As noted in the response to comments, these changes are: (1) Fishermen can use 1991 or 1994 in addition to 1992 or 1993 as years to establish eligibility with respect to earning commercial fishing income; (2) fishermen can use 1990 as a base year and 1994 as a comparison year to calculate the amount of uninsured loss; (3) charterboat permit holders are eligible for the buyout program at the discretion of Washington State; and (4) the geographical range for habitat restoration projects has been expanded. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> NEAP Program <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> I. Statutory Authority <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 308(d) of the IFA, codified at 16 U.S.C. 4107(d), authorizes the Secretary to award grants to persons engaged in commercial fisheries, for uninsured and uncompensated losses determined by the Secretary to have been suffered as a direct result of a fishery resource disaster. Set forth below are the conditions and definitions established by NOAA, pursuant to authority delegated by the Secretary, to implement the programs described in part III. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The IFA requires that ``the Secretary shall determine the extent, and the beginning and ending dates of any fishery resource disaster'' (16 U.S.C. 4107)(d)(2)). Although there have been declining trends in landings from the salmon fisheries in recent years, a sharp decline did not occur until after 1991. This sharp decline coincided with an extreme El Ni&ntilde;o ocean warming event during 1992&hyph;1993. The 1994 season is the first season in which all ocean fisheries for coho were closed; the projected chinook harvest for ocean fisheries indicates a new record low will be achieved, eclipsing the previous record low in 1992. Therefore, for the purposes of the NEAP, the beginning and ending dates of the fishery resource disaster are January 1, 1992, and December 31, 1994, respectively. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The extent of this disaster includes the waters and habitat associated with the salmon fisheries of northern California, Oregon and Washington. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

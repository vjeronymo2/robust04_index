			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / UK News (Employment): IBM deals blow to computer leasing THE computer leasing industry is up in arms over a change in policy by International Business Machines, the world's largest computer manufacturer, which other companies believe threatens their ability to continue providing customers with secondhand and rebuilt mainframe computers. IBM has already taken legal action in the US against Comdisco, the largest leasing company, claiming it has been 'counterfeiting' components in computers sold to customers as IBM machines. It has now written to customers, brokers and leasing companies in Europe warning them that critical components in rebuilt IBM machines may also have been passed off as being manufactured by IBM. Such components could be more likely to fail than its own parts, IBM warns. They would also not qualify under the company's maintenance agreement. Customers, brokers and their bankers fear that the new policy could adversely affect the price of used IBM equipment. An immediate effect has been a doubling of the price of genuine IBM memory cards - printed circuit boards bearing an array of semiconductor chips. The cards, which store 128m bits of information, have risen in price from Pounds 100,000 to Pounds 200,000 in the past few months. The row, although apparently esoteric, is critically important because of the size and significance of the broking and leasing business. In Europe alone it generates revenues of Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.7bn) a year and is a principal mechanism through which medium-sized and large businesses acquire IBM mainframes. Refurbishing and refitting old machines to suit customers' requirements is basic to the economics of the leasing business. Until now IBM has approved this procedure and validated rebuilt machines. Mr Geoffrey Sewell, director-general of the Birmingham-based European Computer Leasing and Trading Association, said it was the most important issue the leasing industry has faced since IBM user equipment was first traded in the early 1970s. 'If IBM has its way, the net result will be that within three years there will be no other source of new and secondhand machines than IBM itself,' he said. He added that IBM was right to be concerned that the integrity of its products was not compromised, but that the rules should not be changed retrospectively. He wanted an amnesty on all equipment currently installed and running well, while discussion continued between the association and IBM on a policy for the future. IBM's case against Comdisco in the US will be heard on April 15.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Again, while dry chemicals are in widespread use, another new technology for both  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the total flooding and streaming markets involves the use of powdered aerosols, which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> combine fine powder particulates with gas to achieve a total flood effect.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While foams are also in widespread use, one manufacturer has prepared a blend of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> etoxylated linear alcohol and sulfonated soap for use in streaming applications. This blend is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not a clean agent, but offers another alternative technology where secondary damage can be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tolerated. It presents benefits of rapid cool-down, prevention of reignition, and decrease in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the quantity of water required to extinguish fires.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Response to Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Key issues included in the public comment are addressed in this section. For a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complete discussion of public comments received, refer to the ``Response to Comments''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> document in the public docket. The issues addressed in this section include: Alternative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technologies, efficacy and design, use conditions, narrowed use restrictions, and halon  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> categories and subdivisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Alternative technologies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As halon is being phased out, there is a growing interest in not only clean chemical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substitutes but also in reassessing the use of conventional substitutes, adopting new risk  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> management strategies and using alternative technologies. Several commenters expressed the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> view that alternatives such as water and CO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  are not clean agent chemical substitutes, but  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rather conventional suppression system substitutes, and have been in widespread use for many  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> years. Thus, these commenters stated that such alternatives are outside the scope of SNAP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and that EPA should only list clean agent chemical substitutes. They indicated that it would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be counterproductive to list all acceptable substitutes and alternatives under SNAP, which are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> better addressed by the entire fire protection community, and that doing so would restrict  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> trade and development of new technology. One commenter said it was unclear what purpose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be served by attempting to list all substitutes and alternatives, including a variety of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system technologies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 612 of the Clean Air Act specifies that class I and class II substances shall be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> replaced by ``chemicals, product substitutes, or alternative manufacturing processes that reduce  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> overall risks to human health and the environment'' and directs EPA to assist in identifying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such substitutes and alternatives, promote their development, maintain a public clearinghouse,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and publish lists of acceptable and unacceptable substitutes for specific uses. EPA interprets  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this language as a broad mandate to include alternative technologies. For the fire suppression  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and explosion protection sector, EPA is defining alternative technology to be any non-halocarbon substance discharged for the purpose of fire suppression or explosion protection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thus, water mist, inert gas mixtures, powdered aerosols and any other `not in kind'  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative to CFCs and halons are alternative technologies. EPA believes that its assessment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of potential human health and environmental impacts of these new technologies does, in fact,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> speed their acceptance and adoption by removing uncertainty about their safe use. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition, while water sprinklers, carbon dioxide, foam, and dry chemical are currently in use,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these substances fall within the definition of alternative technology. EPA will simply list  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these as acceptable and note their applicable NFPA standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA will assess each class of alternative technology and determine whether a separate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> review is prudent due to variations in formulation and design of similar technologies, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether it is possible to construct a broad listing of acceptability that covers several  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturers. In this final rule, EPA is listing each water mist technology as well as inert  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gas blends and powdered aerosols separately due to the unique formulation, design and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intended use of each. An acceptable or unacceptable listing of a particular alternative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technology is not generalizable to similar technologies from other manufacturers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Efficacy and design issues.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many commenters state that in the NPRM, EPA has assumed that a single design  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentration (obtained from a cup burner test for heptane) is applicable for all fire hazards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and requested that EPA remove all reference to design concentration. However, several  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters noted that listing of the design concentration was useful in comparing the relative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efficacy of substitute agents, as long as EPA is clear about the source of the data.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, many commenters feel that while EPA states that the SNAP rule ``is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intended not to replace, but to complement the guidance of the fire protection community,''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA has ``dangerously oversimplified'' the many factors that must be taken into consideration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in designing a system, and a listing of ``acceptability'' implies that any alternative will work in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a safe and effective manner. One commenter specifically requested that EPA remove all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> references to design and installation requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many commenters believe that EPA should not comment on the efficacy of substitutes,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as this is outside the scope of the SNAP rule, and that EPA should only comment on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environmental and toxicological concerns. The commenters believe EPA should only list the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agent name, EPA's decision, NOAEL, and any specific environmental or regulatory concerns  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (such as ODP, GWP, or future phaseout date.) One commenter is concerned that EPA's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> involvement in efficacy issues will cause users to select agents that will result in less effective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and more expensive protection than is needed, and will make American industry less  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> competitive in world markets.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter summed up the requests of many others, suggesting that, at a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minimum, EPA should include cautionary wording that a listing of `acceptable' does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> imply the agent will work in any given application. Further, EPA should point out that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efficacy of an agent is dependent on the application system and should encourage users to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consult current consensus fire codes and standards such as those developed by NFPA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By contrast, EPA believes that efficacy of a substitute agent must be a consideration in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decision making, because EPA's charge is to ensure that substitutes are not on balance more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> risky than the ozone-depleting compounds being replaced. A substitute which is not effective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cannot be considered safer than the halon being replaced. In addition, design concentration is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> germane to a discussion of potential exposure and its consequent effects on human health.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

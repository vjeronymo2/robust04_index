			<p><P> December 18, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPECIAL SCREENINGS: 30TH ANNIVERSARY SHOWING OF ORIGINAL 'ANNE FRANK' AT BING  </P> <P> To commemorate the 30th anniversary of George Stevens' "The Diary of Anne  Frank" LACMA will present the film Thursday at 7:30 p.m. in the Bing Theater in  its original roadshow version, which has been out of circulation for three  decades and is 20 minutes longer than the cut that went into general release.  </P> <P> "The Diary of Anne Frank" stands the test of time magnificently. In replicating  meticulously the tall old building in Amsterdam in which Anne Frank, her family  and others hid from the Nazis for over two years, Stevens left off one side,  which allowed him to move the camera swiftly from floor to floor, letting us  see what the Franks et al could only hear from their split-level attic. Stevens  puts what sounds like a theatrical device to an intensely cinematic effect, and  it is typical of the imagination with which he and writers Frances Goodrich and  Albert Hackett adapted their play, based on Frank's diary, to the screen. The  film is never stagy, yet we experience both the claustrophobia of those in  hiding and the soaring of Anne's poetic imagination, which knew no walls.  </P> <P> The film is at once the story of an exceptional individual's coming of age and  the study of eight people living in constant fear and in cramped quarters but  managing to hold on to their humanity and to live their lives with as much  meaning and fullness as possible. There have been many Holocaust dramas and  documentaries since this film was released, but time has only increased the  impact of "The Diary of Anne Frank" and underlined its tragedy.  </P> <P> The cast is ensemble playing at its best. There was considerable controversy at  the time in the casting of the non-Jewish Millie Perkins as Anne, but she is  certainly radiant and captivating. Joseph Schildkraut and Gusti Huber are  Anne's parents, figures of enormous strength and dignity. Shelley Winters is  the vulgar but kindly Mrs. Van Daan, and Ed Wynn is Dussell, a gentle but  crotchety and pessimistic elderly dentist. Rounding out the attic's inhabitants  are Lou Jacobi as the portly Van Daan, Richard Beymer as his teen-age son and  Diane Baker as Anne's older, more reserved sister. Their benefactors are played  by Douglas Spencer, proprietor of the building's spice factory, and his  secretary Miep (Dody Heath). We soon forget the cast's variety of accents.  </P> <P> The romantic and creative yearnings of Anne, who is 13 when she goes into  hiding, play against the film's frequent suspense, which occurs most  agonizingly when Spencer's office is robbed not once but twice while the antics  of Beymer's cat threaten to expose the hiding place. Punctuating the daily  lives of the Franks and their friends are air raids, the sound of Nazi soldiers  marching on cobblestone streets and the ominous siren of the Black Marias in  which the Nazis round up the Jews. In the face of unceasing peril and  uncertainty Anne somehow was able to summon within herself the faith to confide  to her diary that "I still believe, in spite of everything, that people are  really good at heart."  </P> <P> Information: (213) 857-6010.  </P></p>

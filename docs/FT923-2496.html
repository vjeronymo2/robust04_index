			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / Protests lodged with Russia JAPAN HAS made an official protest to Russia over a development project on the island of Shikotan, part of the southern Kuriles chain seized by Soviet troops at the end of the second world war but still claimed by Japan. The row was at the heart of the abrupt cancellation last week of a visit to Japan by President Boris Yeltsin. Relations between the two countries have since grown icy as each side has hardened its position and sought to blame the other over the cancellation. The protest is over a decision by the Sakhalin provincial authorities to grant a development contract for part of the island to Carlson &amp; Kaplan, a Hong Kong company. The contract involves a 50-year lease on 278 hectares of land, for which the company is to pay Dollars 125m (Pounds 63.4m). The company plans to build a casino. The protest, delivered to the Russian Foreign Ministry in Moscow and to the Russian embassy in Tokyo, said that Japan could not tolerate the contract because it covered Japanese territory, which the former Soviet government had agreed in 1956 to return. Mr Koichi Kato, chief cabinet secretary, said yesterday that Japan was ready to file a second protest if it was able to confirm reports that an Austrian company might obtain a contract to build a golf course on Kunishir, another of the disputed islands.</p>

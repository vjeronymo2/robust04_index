			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Leeds' staff told of merger impact Substantial closures in the branch network of the Leeds Permanent Building Society are unlikely for a year at least, despite the plans to merge with Halifax Building Society, Leeds' staff representatives have been told by the society's management. The national council of the Leeds' staff association met yesterday for the first time since the proposed merger between two of the UK's largest societies was announced. Its members approved 11 general principles to be followed in discussions with the Leeds' managers, including full disclosure of information about the merger, a commitment to no redundancies and the introduction of a voluntary early retirement plan. In March the 10m members who own the two societies will have the chance to vote on the merger plans. Their consent is needed for the move to go ahead. There is considerable overlap in the 1,100 branches operated by the two societies, so some branches are likely to close and some jobs to be lost. Staff representatives are emphasising that where branches do close, most employees should be able to transfer to other offices locally. Going through the full consultation procedures before branch closures would take about a year. Mr Jon Foulds, Halifax chairman, said last week that where branches were too close together, the idea of using some of them as financial services advice centres would be carefully examined. Though neither society has ruled out compulsory redundancies, it is clear they would prefer jobs to go voluntarily.</p>

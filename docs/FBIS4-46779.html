			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Arkadiy Solovyev, deputy chairman of the FNPR </F> Commission for the Socio-Economic Development of the North, and  Albert Kozlov: "Wheat Does Not Grow in Evenkia: The Inhabitants  of the North Cannot Get the Goods Necessary for Life in This  Navigation Period"]    [Text] For Russia, the North is two-thirds of the territory  of the country, in which one-tenth of the population lives. The  North means oil, coal, diamonds, gold, furs, timber and huge  reserves of other raw material resources.    But here is the paradox. The government wants to obtain  increasingly more from the northerners, but shows increasingly  less concern for them. In order for the people to live and work  normally in the bleak, remote regions, almost everything has to  be delivered there: grain, vegetables, matches, soap, clothing,  medicines, production equipment....    It was always that way. The system of supply for the  northerners has been in effect in the country for decades. First  they accumulated cargo at specific river and sea ports, and as  soon as spring came to those regions, ships loaded with  everything needed hurried to these god-forsaken corners, hard to  reach even by plane. All the same, in the short navigation  period, the seamen and river workers delivered to the  northerners almost everything that they needed for life in the  long winter and Arctic night.    The system that had been set up has been breaking down in  the  last few years. Take last winter. Even the government was forced  to evaluate the supply situation for the North as catastrophic.  As early as December, for example, the collective of the Tokhomo  geological prospecting enterprise, which is in the Evenkia  settlement of Baykhit, had no products, medicines, goods for  production purposes, and this means wages as well. In the 1993  navigation period, less than half of what was proposed was  delivered there. It is a wonder that the people survived last  winter. It was the same over the entire expanse of the Russian  "norths" -- from the Kola Peninsula to Chukotka and the Kuril  Islands....    Just a few days remain until the opening of this navigation  season on the northern rivers. What kind of situation faces it?  It can't get any worse....  <H8>  Cargo Accumulation in the Ports by 1 May 1994 (in percent of </H8> the corresponding period in 1993) Blagoveshchensk0    Tobolsk0    Omsk4    Labytnangi2    Krasnoyarsk16    Tyumen22    Osetrovo18    Surgut22    Pechora30    As can be seen, government bodies drew no conclusions from  the extremely grave situation of last year. One can see that  they are not hastening to do so. In confirmation of this, we  will present one more table.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Financial Needs for Delivery in 1994                                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |            |Delivery (mln t)         |Need for financing (trl rubles)       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |            |1994        |1993        |I           |II          |total incl. |  |            |            |            |            |            |per kw      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Foodstuffs  |19          |22          |4           |0.4         |2           |  |and goods f-|            |            |            |            |            |  |or people's |            |            |            |            |            |  |consumption |            |            |            |            |            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Petroleum p-|13          |14          |4           |0.1         |2           |  |roducts and |            |            |            |            |            |  |coal        |            |            |            |            |            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Goods for p-|12          |14          |1.3         |--          |0.5         |  |roduction-t-|            |            |            |            |            |  |echnical pu-|            |            |            |            |            |  |rposes      |            |            |            |            |            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |TOTAL       |43          |49          |9.5         |0.5         |4.5         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      The problem of survival was mentioned with alarm at the  recent 4th Conference of Trade Unions of Northern Territories.  Quite a few bitter words were spoken about the financial-credit  mechanism for cargo delivery. The trade union estimate of this  situation was also supported by the Federation Council. The  deputies, expressing their concern about the situation in the  regions, passed the appropriate resolution. Deputy hearings on  these problems began in the State Duma.    Only in the government structures are they continuing to  discuss the subject of a comprehensive solution to the northern  problem. The matter goes no farther than talks, though. The most  dangerous thing is that the necessary volume of financing is not  fully coordinated with the State budget.    Considering all this, as well as the economic problems  becoming more exacerbated in the regions, the FNPR  [FITUR--Federation of Independent Trade Unions of Russia] has  repeatedly appealed to the RF President with a proposal to hold  a meeting under his leadership with the participationg of all  those involved in the important national economic problem. There  is no time left for further shelving of this problem.</p>

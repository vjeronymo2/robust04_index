			<p>BFN     [Text] Twenty people were arrested in France this morning  in another police operation against Basque Fatherland and  Liberty [ETA]. David Morales, our correspondent in Paris, has  the latest:    [Morales] The latest information on the police swoop in the  French Basque country and Brittany reveals that among the 20 or  so arrested for their alleged links with ETA -- the majority of  them French citizens -- there are at least five Spaniards.  Police sources contacted by RNE say that the operation is still  going on but they have refused to reveal the identities of those  arrested. They could be connected with the terrorist  organization's support infrastructure in France. The arrests  seem to be a result of investigations carried out by the Paris  investigating magistrate, Laurence Levert, on ETA but other  sources also believe that there is a link between the  extradition to Spain on 2 June under the emergency procedure,  that is without the customary hearing, of ETA member Jose  Domingo Aizpurua Aizpuru, alias Pitxas, just as he was leaving  Fleury prison on the outskirts of Paris where he had just served  a sentence for criminal association.</p>

			<p><P> October 9, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TAXPAYERS WON'T PAY FOR BED, DINKINS SAYS  </P> <P> Mayor David N. Dinkins promised Monday that his head will not rest at taxpayer  expense, whatever the final price tag on a bed that a magazine said is going to  cost $11,500.  </P> <P> Newsweek noted that the bed's arrival at the mayor's official residence  coincided with municipal money woes that led Dinkins to freeze hiring, propose  new taxes and talk about 15,000 layoffs.  </P> <P> If it costs what Newsweek said, that "will all be covered by private donations  from friends of the city, many of whom have contacted me this morning to offer  their contributions," the mayor said in a statement issued by his press  secretary, Albert Scardino.  </P></p>

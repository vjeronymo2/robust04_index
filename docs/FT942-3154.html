			<p>940616 FT  16 JUN 94 / Inflation remains subdued in May The price of salad vegetables, spectacles and secondhand cars rose last month, while footwear, furniture and heating costs fell. Overall inflationary pressures remained subdued in spite of a small rise in the underlying rate of inflation, figures from the Central Statistical yesterday showed. The retail price index including mortgages rose 2.6 per cent in the year to May. This meant that the rate of headline inflation was unchanged from the previous month. However the retail price index was 144.7, up from 144.2 in April. Measured without mortgage payments - a category favoured by the government as a better guide - the index showed that the underlying level of inflation was 2.5 per cent, up from April's rate of 2.3 per cent. The figures were marginally worse than City forecasts, which had predicted a 0.1 per cent fall in the headline inflation rate. But analysts yesterday pointed out that the rise in the underlying rate was affected by seasonal factors and said that the overall pattern suggested weak inflationary pressures. Mr Don Smith, UK economist with Midland Global Markets said: 'Seasonal foods can be very volatile - this month they added 0.1 per cent to the underlying rate.' Measured on a monthly basis the price of seasonal foods rose by 6.9 per cent in May - the biggest monthly increase since May 1966. Fresh vegetables were the main contributor, with the cost of lettuces pushed up by crop problems in Spain. Potato prices also rose sharply in the month and were 30 per cent higher than last May, largely as a result of storage problems. But this was partly offset by the non-seasonal food sector, where prices rose only 0.1 per cent on the month - the lowest increase for 12 years. The CSO said that this reflected continued price discounting of items such as bread and cakes. Elsewhere the price of household goods recovered slightly over the month after falling in spring sales, although prices still remain 0.3 per cent lower than last May. Costs in the motoring sector were higher in May than April, with a 2p rise in the price of petrol and 0.5 per cent growth in the cost of secondhand cars. The clothing and footwear sector continued to show signs of sharp competition, with the cost of women's clothing falling 0.3 per cent month-on-month. The CSO expects clothing costs to fall further with the summer sales.</p>

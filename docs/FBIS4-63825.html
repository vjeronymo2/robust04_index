			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [ITAR-TASS report: "A Find for America"] </F>   [Text] Russia is being sold both wholesale and retail.  Presently this is an open secret. Yet another news agency  report has only proved the point.    The U.S. government's private investment corporation has  started a search for Far Eastern regions that are most promising  in terms of investment. Yesterday, the Americans visited the  free economic zone at Nakhodka, where they examined its ports  and enterprises.    The U.S. mission will also visit Khabarovsk Kray, Sakhalin,  and Kamchatka. After the tour, the mission chief, U.S. Senator  Ruth Harkin, said they will give recommendations to her  country's entrepreneurs as to which regions of the Russian Far  East are best for investment. She called Nakhodka one of Russia  's most promising areas at this stage.</p>

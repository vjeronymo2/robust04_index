In an unofficial version released by the press, Salinas  asked  the CNDH president to establish contacts with the Zapatista  National Liberation Army (EZLN) to attain the liberation of the  soldier and politician, who was kidnapped by guerrillas in the  early days of the conflict.    According to the press, the government is trying to handle  this affair discretely in order to ease the negotiation with the  captors.    EZLN Representatives had stated that they would subject the  former governor to a summary trial for repressing the indigenous  peoples and peasants of Chiapas during his regime. Castellanos  was kidnapped from his San Joaquin Ranch in Las Margaritas  Municipality, Chiapas State.    The doctors of the Social Security Institute, who were set  free in Guadalupe Tepeyac Municipality, have reported that  General Castellanos was still alive and in a normal condition.    According to a journalistic version, the EZLN has informed  his relatives that they will subject the former governor's fate  to a vote, whereas another version has reported the total  silence of his captors and that the general was in the town of  Maravillas Trinidad.</p>

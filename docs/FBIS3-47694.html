A total of 350 warplanes were involved in the exercises.    In another development, ground units of the puppet army held  a ground attack exercise for a surprise breakthrough on the  military demarcation line in Cholwon County, South Korean  Kangwon Province, Thursday with the support of fighters and  helicopter gunboats.    A group of puppet army tanks deployed in Paju County  advanced  up to the bank of the Imjin River together with infantry units,  firing scores of shells.    Large-calibre artillery units and armed bandits of the  puppet  army went off into war hysterics, firing shells and bullets in  Yonchon, Paju and Cholwon counties.

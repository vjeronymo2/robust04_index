			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Capital reform for Lloyd's Sir, Reform is due for the Lloyd's method of allocating capital to syndicates by queueing or, to quote the Lex column (February 19), granting of 'grace-and-favour indulgence'. Its replacement with the adoption of a value/trading system for syndicate shares would bring an improvement in efficiency of the market for the benefit of all Lloyd's investors. Corporate members, whose share prices reflect value for their 1994 account syndicate participations, have no grounds for objection to this. Indeed, the greatest benefit professional corporate investors can bring to Lloyd's is the demand for the introduction of further investor rights enjoyed in other capital markets.

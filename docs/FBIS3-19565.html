			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] In a brief article, the 24 February  Athens daily I KATHIMERINI cites Theodhoros Pangalos, alternate  minister of foreign affairs in charge of European affairs, as  stating to the Athens daily MESIMVRINI that Greece is in bad  economic straits. Pangalos also stressed the need for "five  years of harsh austerity" and expressed the fear that the  European Union [EU] may remand Greece to the control of the IMF.  Pangalos, who, according to rumors, does not wish to remain in  the Ministry of Foreign Affairs beyond the end of the Greek EU  presidency in June, also disagrees with the government's ongoing  "social dialogue" with professional classes. In this regard, the  alternate minister said that "the government is conducting talks  with representatives of tax evaders." The article comments that  Pangalos clearly no longer intends to limit himself strictly to  matters within his own purview, especially in light of the  forthcoming Panhellenic Socialist Movement congress.</p>

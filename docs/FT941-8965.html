			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / Minister to address TUC Mr Stephen Dorrell, the financial secretary to the Treasury, has agreed to speak to next month's Trades Union Congress public-sector conference being held to protest at the government's pay freeze. This is the first time in living memory that a Conservative minister has addressed an organised TUC conference. It indicates that the TUC, under its new general secretary Mr John Monks, is keen to re-establish its credentials as an organisation that is ready to do business with the government of the day whatever its political colour. It is also a sign that the TUC is keen to distance itself from a close identification with the Labour party. Since the Conservatives were elected to office in 1979 relations between the TUC and the government have been virtually non-existent. As prime minister the then Mrs Margaret Thatcher rarely met TUC delegations. Mr Dorrell can expect widespread criticism from public-sector union delegates when he visits Congress House in London on March 3. The unions representing 4.5m workers remain strongly opposed to the government's freezing of the pay bill. The TUC believes it will require heavy job losses to provide efficiency savings to pay public-sector workers rises of more than 2 per cent.</p>

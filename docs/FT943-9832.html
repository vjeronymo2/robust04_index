			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Programme Africa itself wants Sir, Michael Holman's article on the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation ('UNloved, UNwanted', August 4) misses a number of points about the Industrial Development Decade for Africa (IDDA). It isn't strictly a Unido programme: the African countries themselves want it, are committed to it and are primarily responsible for carrying it out. Moreover, all countries, developed and developing, supported its adoption. Unquestionably, Africa's industrialisation is a difficult task. But the alternative is one no one would wish for: a continent forever dependent on external aid and intervention. A concentration on Africa's industrialisation is an attempt to get beyond the short-term solutions, and instead, through rising standards of living, to offer longer-term market possibilities for all countries. Unido's direct resources for IDDA programmes are small, but we give all the support we can. Our main activities are entirely demand oriented - funded through UNDP, bilateral donors, and, increasingly, the private sector itself. We are given this work because we are seen to have skills and resources that are needed for Africa's industrialisation, just as in other parts of the world. Michael Holman may find this risible, but it is a fact, and it keeps us busy. I'm sorry he didn't like the 1983 document he quoted. We could provide him with some later ones. In a multi-cultural environment, our prose does tend to get rather heavy, and the style hardly matches A A Milne's. We were compared with Pooh Bear, at least not with Eeyore.

			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / International Company News: VW cautious despite reduced loss Volkswagen, Europe's leading volume carmaker, hopes to return to break-even this year after a first-quarter loss of around DM400m (Dollars 238m), compared with a DM1.25bn deficit in the same period of 1993. Mr Ferdinand Piech, chairman, advocated caution in the light of last year's 'surprises', when his spring forecast of a break-even result became a crash into a DM1.94bn loss. Results at Seat, the Spanish subsidiary whose near-collapse was blamed for the 1993 earnings slump, would be the deciding factor, he said. According to Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, group production director, the aim was for Seat to turn the corner in mid-1995. The VW brand was likely to improve its earnings. The Audi quality car division was budgeting to break even, as were the North American businesses. However, Mr Piech forecast heavy losses at Seat and deficits in Latin America. Skoda, the Czech subsidiary, would have a tough time to break even, he warned. Hinting at a brighter medium-term future, the chairman said the group had in one year carried through 20 per cent of the cost-cutting measures so far identified. The remaining potential for economies was 'the stuff of dreams'. Manufacturing costs in Germany had been reduced by DM1,000 a car, he claimed. Domestic factories had reached the point last year when they could break even working at 79 per cent of capacity, compared with 102 per cent in 1992. The level would fall to 74 per cent in the current year, and be reduced progressively to 65 per cent, Mr Piech said. Further job cuts this year - mostly outside Germany and concentrated in Spain and Latin America - would cut the global workforce by 25,000 to some 226,000. Group-wide productivity would be lifted by 25 per cent by the end of 1995, he said. Meanwhile, the introduction of the four-day week in six German factories making VW vehicles would reduce labour costs by DM1.6bm this year, according to Mr Peter Hartz, personnel director. Audi earlier this week announced a similar scheme involving a 10 per cent cut in working hours and pay. According to Mr Piech, VW was out-performing its competitors and the market, helped by price-cuts. European orders for VW models had risen 11.8 per cent in the first quarter, and German demand was up 54 per cent. Audi orders were down 14 per cent. Total group deliveries to customers were up 4.7 per cent at 838,000 vehicles. According to a breakdown of last year's results, published yesterday, the VW AG parent company earned a net DM71m - just enough to cover a DM2 dividend. Seat lost DM1.84bn, while the North American businesses lost more than DM460m. Skoda results, affected by new company legislation, showed a loss after tax of DM247m against net earnings of DM233m in 1992.</p>

			<p><P> April 14, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: WILSHIRE CENTER  </P> <P> If life is a stage then Laurie Pincus is a playwright turned set designer. The  New York artist's thin wooden cutout plywood figures are painted with the  bright colors of a third-grade primer. They display a fascination for the  theatrics of early film as well as folk art's straightforward approach to  articulating the figure. Yet despite all the melodramatic posturing the  tableaux she creates are emotionally empty.  </P> <P> The characters, in their shallow plays with real space, feel as remote as  single frames taken from an unfamiliar old movie. Titles like "Gangster, T.V.  Man and Art" run by like a list of lead characters taunting the scene's  ambiguity with meaning only to let the hint drop.  </P> <P> As metaphors for the human condition Pincus' characters are a bunch of wooden  eccentrics, more facade than real. What makes them interesting in their flat,  paper doll stylishness is the way the artist adds playful fragments of film  technique to suggest states of mind. From the enlarged figurative montage in  pieces like "The Witness" to the bent, ominous shadow doppelgangers in "The  Shadowboxer," Pincus translates old film devices into interesting and  surprising pseudo stagecraft. Most intriguing is the rolling canvas backdrop  she uses in three small wall pieces. Here the figures stay rooted while the  background unfurls time, space or a dream narrative behind them. This kind of  invention, recalling the rotating scenery in old Western movies, is what makes  the static stylizations fun. (Jan Baum Gallery, 170 S. La Brea Ave., to April  29). SUVAN GEER  </P></p>

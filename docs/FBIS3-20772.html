			<p>Language: <F P=105> Macedonian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Boris Zmejkovski, general secretary for the </F> Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization-Democratic Party  for Macedonian National Unity, by an unidentified correspondent;  place and date not given: "End of the Mystery!"]    [Text] We did not react until now in Ohrid, because changes  are not made overnight; the authorized representative's seal is  the valid one; those who say that they will clear up the  situation completely have the wrong orientation; the incident  with the Bulgarian leaflets is clear, and therefore it is  incomprehensible why some of our members are being accused of it.    The current split in the Ohrid municipal committee of the  VMRO-DPMNE [Internal Macedonian Revolutionary  Organization-Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity] is  the reason for our conversation with the party's general  secretary, Boris Zmejkovski. As we reported in the last two  issues, there are two parallel party leaderships in Ohrid, with  both of them claiming that they are legitimate. As they say,  they are using the same offices, but they are using two  different seals. The consequences of this situation are quarrels  among the membership but also uncertainty among Ohrid residents,  caused by the break-ins at the party offices, the threats, the  rumors about corruption, and even the rumors about preparations  for an assassination attempt against the party's leaders.    [VECER] Why hasn't the party leadership reacted yet to this  situation, which has been going on for several months?    [Zmejkovski] First, I would like to say that it is right  that  the quarrels in our party are being published in the news media,  in contrast to the conflicts in other parties, about which  people keep silent. We are likewise grateful, however, that you  contacted the party's leadership, since I hope that this will be  the beginning of the end of this kind of mystery about what is  happening now in Ohrid.    It has to do with the inappropriate and undisciplined  behavior of certain members--instigators and street  brawlers--some of whom even dared to confiscate food products in  the name of the party, such as Tane Markovski. Those members  were expelled from the VMRO-DPMNE. According to the statute, the  party's general secretary is authorized, in the event of  internal disagreements or passivity, to conduct dismissals and  appointments in the municipal committees until conditions are  created for the election of a new president. Milco Spirovski,  who is authorized by the VMRO-DPMNE, is legitimate for our party  in Ohrid.    We did not react until now because we are examining the  incidents; we also have statements by citizens of Ohrid. Changes  cannot be made overnight. Second, it is not usual to make  public announcements immediately about internal party conflicts.    [VECER] So it is not true that you deliberately did not  react  to let the stronger faction win?    [Zmejkovski] We never choose between the stronger and the  weaker faction in any case. Certainly it is least of all in our  interest to have schisms in municipal committees. The main thing  is for the program to be respected. If that is not done, anyone  can be expelled from the party.    [VECER] Since there are two party seals in Ohrid, can you  explain which one is valid?    [Zmejkovski] The seal of the people who are authorized by  the  party is the valid one. Back in September I sent a letter to the  dismissed president telling him to return the party seal,  pointing out that he could face party and criminal proceedings.  He did not even come to turn over the seal, however, so a seal  that is not valid is being misused.    [VECER] What is happening with the party offices, which are  being used by both camps?    [Zmejkovski] The unauthorized ones do not have any right to  use those offices. Regardless of who bought or rented them, they  are party offices and as such are part of the party's inventory.  If anyone leaves the party, he cannot say that the party's  property is his own personal property; he never had it.    [VECER] How do you view the announcements by the  unauthorized  faction that it will completely clear up the situation and the  rumors that an early VMRO-DPMNE congress will be demanded?    [Zmejkovski] That is demagogy and ordinary illusions. It is  the same thing as saying that the UDBA [State Security  Administration], which created the quarrels in the party, will  be fully cleared up.    I can only say that those people have a very incorrect  orientation and they are getting carried away. There are no  malcontents in VMRO-DPMNE. I personally do not have anything  against those who feel that way forming another party.  <H5>  The State Security Service [SDB] Phenomenon </H5>   [VECER] I also asked the question because we are getting the  impression that there are also serious conflicts in other cities  where the VMRO-DPMNE was quite stable, for instance Bitola,  Veles, Kicevo, and Prilep.    [Zmejkovski] It is really a phenomenon, perhaps unfamiliar  to  someone, but quite familiar to us. It is a consequence of the  continued operation of the SDB. Naturally, they strike against  the stronger committees; they do not have any interest in  striking against the more passive committees.    [VECER] How do you explain the fact that the "unauthorized"  ones are claiming that members of the other faction in Ohrid  distributed Bulgarian leaflets?    [Zmejkovski] I will repeat: The leaflets were distributed in  Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]  by the Communist Party, headed by its leadership, under the  auspices of Tito Petkovski. Now that all of this is known, it is  incomprehensible to me that the "unauthorized ones" are saying  that the other group did it. The unauthorized ones are no longer  members of our party and probably joined us for other  reasons--in this case it is clear that they are working for the  interests of another party and under its instructions, solely in  order to destroy the VMRO-DPMNE.    [VECER] Are you taking seriously the rumors about  assassination attempts against the party's leadership?    [Zmejkovski] It is a serious matter that we will certainly  examine seriously. Perhaps it is also a matter of slander, and  the party will hold accountable those who made those statements.  I would rather not go into further discussions of this issue,  however.    I would like to say that we will institute proceedings  regarding the seals, and the police have already been informed  about the offices. Nevertheless, it should be noted that when  the VMRO-DPMNE lodges complaints, the police investigations take  a very long time.    [VECER] Don't you suspect that such quarrels within the  party  could lead to a decline in the number of members and in the  party's standing? Specifically, it is being said in Ohrid that  that is precisely what will happen as a result of the  recognition of the authorized representatives' legitimacy.    [Zmejkovski] I would not agree that the people there will  contribute to a loss of membership, since every member and voter  makes decisions independently, and by clearing up the situation  we can only win new members.</p>

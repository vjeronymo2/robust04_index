			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Gaza correspondent 'Amira Hess] </F>   [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Hasan 'Asfur, a leader of the  Palestinian People's Party (formerly the Communist Party) and a  senior participant in the negotiations for the Declaration of  Principles and the Cairo agreement, was expelled from the  party's ranks in a special session of the central committee held  in the West Bank earlier this week. According to party members,  the decision came "due to 'Asfur's role in the negotiations that  led to the Cairo agreement on 4 May, an agreement repudiated by  the party."    'Asfur's membership in the central committee had been frozen  in the past few months due to his participation in the Cairo  talks. Upon returning to the Gaza Strip after a 26-year absence,  'Asfur, a resident of 'Abasan, was appointed as supervisor of  the civilian and military talks.    The communique issued by the central committee reiterates  the  party's opposition to take part in the self-government.  Following the signing of the Cairo agreement, senior party  members in the Gaza Strip had been pushing to join the  Palestinian Authority institutions "in order to promote  democratization," although "this runs counter to the Palestinian  People's Party's official line, whereby we should not  participate in any official institution of the self-rule  authority."

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Roundtable Discussion with Takuma Yamamoto, board of </F> directors chairman, Fujitsu; Yoshimasa Ito, president, director  Koden Seisakusho; Kenji Naemura, professor, Keio University;  Wataru Aso, director general, Japan Patent Office; place and  date not given: "For Implementation of Globally Sustainable  Patent System"]    [Text] Increasing Number of Intellectual Property  Disputes    [Wataru Aso] These days the number of international patent  disputes or, more generally, the number of international  intellectual property disputes is increasing. Domestic patent  disputes are also on the rise. Furthermore, huge sums are being  awarded these days for patent infringements.    I'd like to start by getting a clear picture of the  situation  and your views on what's happening. First, I would like to start  with Mr. Yamamoto, who is one of our leading industrialists.    [Takuma Yamamoto] Patent and copyright disputes having to do  with software started increasing in the second half of the  1980's when the United States first adopted policies to protect  intellectual property--in other words, when it started taking a  pro-patent stance. As indicated by Mr. Aso, the settlements have  been fairly large. At one time, large corporations in the United  States took a relatively generous position on patent questions.  Recently that hasn't been the case. The United States is a  society of lawyers, and although I don't have any evidence to  support my suspicions, it seems they tend to stir things up  among smaller and midsized businesses, giving rise to frequent  litigation.    Even setting aside Fujitsu's case, I think we'll find  examples where a broad interpretation is being given to patents.  It's not a matter of simply being "pro-patent" or not. It's a  problem of interpretation: something which the Japanese might  not think is in violation of a patent will be interpreted in the  United States quite differently. Another problem, which will  probably be discussed later, clearly has to do with the patent  system in the United States--with so-called "submarine patents"  that one day seem to surface out of the blue.    [Aso] Mr. Ito's company [Koden Seisakusho] has trading  partners all over the world. Are you encountering problems with  regard to patents or intellectual property rights?    [Yoshimasa Ito] Well, I don't think that we're in violation  of any patents, but when it comes to talk about triple indemnity  awards and parity, those stories in themselves are enough to  make me want to give up on the idea of going to the United  States. Actually, those worries occupy a foremost place in our  work. In the case of the United States, there were a lot of  times, particularly in the case of patents, when I thought that  certain situations wouldn't go well even if they were put in the  hands of a professional.    As Mr. Yamamoto was saying, the United States is a litigious  society, and in a sense, a part of its culture, which emphasizes  on individualism, has taken a strange turn. I think one can say  without exaggerating that there is a side to the current U.S.  pro-patent system that makes it easy to turn patent problems  into disputes, which can be considered to be even immoral.  Certainly that has affected us psychologically to a very great  extent.  <H5>  Japan's Role With Regard to Developing Countries </H5>   [Aso] Professor Naemura, what do you think of this  situation?    [Kenji Naemura] Technology leads economies, and at a time  when economies are turning global, technology naturally crosses  national boundaries and enters various countries. When that  happens, it is inevitable for technologies to come up against  the cultures of those countries and their respective patent and  legal systems. We have to think about strategies ahead of time  premised on those differences.    Questions are now being raised, I think, about Japan's  policy  in light of the pro-patent policy of the United States. It's  not a matter simply for the Japanese Government. More broadly,  it has to involve consensus-building that includes those in  industry.    Right now there are people in Japan asserting that a  pro-patent stance will have the effect of "hollowing out"  industries and that a move to strengthen the patent system, in  and of itself, is not a good idea. Such views may be all right  if one wants to treat the symptoms, but we have to have debates  on whether that is in fact the general consensus in Japan.    With regard to damage awards--data exist showing that,  compared to the early half of the 1980's when the United States  started taking pro-patent measures, the average damage award has  increased about five fold. Compared to increases in the average  cost of goods, a five fold increase in 10 years is just too  steep.    It's like the bubble phenomenon that occurred here with  regard to land prices. Somehow we have to get this situation  under control. At the time, people were asking what would happen  if land prices were to drop suddenly. The same questions are  being asked now. So it's imperative that we consider measures  that will bring things to rest at a suitable level.    [Ito] Take the case of semiconductors for example. Useful  products come into being as the cumulative result of a number of  innovations. When an unreasonable amount is demanded in  royalties for a single patent, technology is going to suffer.  It's going to end up wrecking businesses. Within the United  States, a rather confusing situation has come about as the  result of cross-licensing.    The possibility of strengthening patents was just mentioned.  But patents are like the flowering of an idea that begins with  an individual and then builds on the accumulated wisdom of  others. To claim credit, as if solely responsible for that  flowering, on the basis of what is really only a small part of  the entire process, is excessive and wholly undesirable. There  should be counterarguments to such claims on philosophical  grounds.    For example, when Japan provides technology to developing  countries, we should be able to argue against such claims. Talks  between industrially advanced countries and between advanced  countries and developing countries include surprisingly  nettlesome philosophical issues. U.S. demands at this time, I  can't help feeling, are a little excessive.    [Aso] Mr. Naemura, how do you feel about the relationship  between advanced and developing countries with respect to  intellectual property rights?    [Naemura] I have the feeling the so-called developing  nations  are about two steps behind countries like the United States and  Japan in regard to intellectual property rights. In developing  countries, those rights haven't been clearly set down in a  system yet. But let's say they are. It doesn't follow that these  countries are then all going to be rushing forward in the same  direction as industrially advanced countries.    There is another step in between where technology is  introduced and that serves as the basis for further  technological developments. Compared to economies, when  technology is involved, the process involves at least one more  step, and we have to think about how to help them through that  additional step. It's the sort of problem that can't be solved  simply by making a single rule and having that apply in common  to everyone.    In the last 50 years or so since the end of World War II,  Japan has come through that process, and the current generation  has to pass that know-how on to developing countries. In that  sense, Japan has an extremely important role to play.  <H5>  U.S. System Is a Worldwide Problem </H5>   [Aso] Unlike patents, which specify who the inventor is in a  way that's evident to people, it's often hard, in the case of  copyrights, to tell whose rights have been violated and at what  point until a lawsuit or charge has been brought against the  alleged violator. In other words, copyrights are like land  mines. It's hard to tell where they might lie buried or how big  an explosion they'll set off. Among companies, how is such a  problem handled, I wonder?    [Yamamoto] Well, in the case of programs, one can't go and  investigate each and every invention that has ever been  developed independently. It's impossible to thoroughly research  what amounts to a mountain of material. So a term like  "clean-dom" has appeared. All one can do is isolate oneself in  an environment uncontaminated by others and there development  something uniquely one's own.    For general patents, the Patent Office is creating a  paperless [electronic] database. We would like to use this  database to research precedents and previous technology. It  costs large enterprises a lot of money to research such matters,  but I'm afraid the costs for medium-sized businesses and smaller  enterprises may still be prohibitive.    The U.S. system has caused a lot of problems in the past.  There hasn't been a system for the public to get information,  and one day someone suddenly comes up claiming to have a patent  for old technology which is so self-evident that people now take  it for granted. This leads to a mess. It has driven me to the  point sometimes of almost feeling it is the most unfair system  around, and it really has to be revised. It is a problem that  can probably be solved through harmonization. In any case, I  would definitely like to see the problem resolved as soon as  possible.    [Ito] One of the problems is that you don't know if you're  going to be stepping on a land mine. You don't know where the  land mines have been planted. And even if you do, besides  knowing where they are, you have to have a system that you know  how long a mine is going to be a threat; for example, a battery  should be placed inside them with an expected life span of 20  years, and when those 20 years are up, even if you should step  on them, you're safe.    [Aso] A submarine patent has recently surfaced that has to  do  with [Jerome] Lemelson's image-processing technology. He applied  for the patent in 1954. In 1992, 38 years later, the patent is  finally approved. Under the U.S. system, this patent is in  effect for 17 years, from 1992. Technology that everyone is  using and has assumed is common property suddenly surfaces with  a patent on it. Japan isn't the only country to suffer as a  result. U.S. industries and industries throughout the world are  suffering. This system has to be changed as soon as possible.    [Yamamoto] Lemelson's patent is for technology anyone would  have thought of, and to that extent, it was inevitable that  someone would have tried to patent the idea. The problem is that  such ideas can be patented in the first place. One of the  fundamental problems with the patent system lies here. The  system is causing hardships throughout the world. It's enough to  make me wish we could go back through history and set things  right from the start.    [Naemura] For example, the United States and others are  accusing Japan of having closed, idiosyncratic markets. Make  them the same as markets elsewhere, we're told. But as far as  patent systems go, the U.S. system is also closed and out of  step with systems elsewhere. It also presents a problem in terms  of its domestic-versus-foreign bias. So, we're at a period now,  I think, when we should be asking why the U.S. system is closed  and at the same time explaining to U.S. consumers how that  system is hurting them and its industries in general.    It's true that Japanese industries are having a very hard  time; but the United States isn't going to listen if we say  we're hurting, so their system has to be changed. Rather, what's  needed, I think, is to argue the point that the system is not  only inconveniencing the United States but is bad for elsewhere  in the world as well.    Europe and Japan's positions are very similar. We're both  advocating the same kinds of things: change from a  first-to-invent to a first-to-apply system, to a system where  the public has access to patent information, and to a system  where the patent period is calculated from the date of  application. In the sense that other countries are advocating  such changes, the U.S. system can be said to have become a  worldwide problem.    The first-to-invent system that the United States is  advocating is based on the idea of individualism--giving due  respect to the individual and to individual gifts and  talents--and places disproportionate emphasis on that  philosophy. But I have a feeling that by establishing time  limits, something can somehow be worked out.    [Yamamoto] I think a time limit is the first condition. But  [patents] are very broadly interpreted. For example, in the case  of the autofocus technology in cameras. You think there are no  problems and then you go to the United States and there are.  It's a tough situation to be in. One of the issues involved is  how to decide on a matter when similar patents and similar  claims emerge in a single stretch in the course of history.    In any case, what happens is that the differences in various  systems and ways of thinking rub up against each other to cause  friction among countries. And even with the harmonization of  systems, I suspect there will still be problems.    [Aso] Even when systems are harmonized, the next problem to  arise may be in their application and implementation. But, first  of all, it's important to try our best to harmonize the various  systems.    [Yamamoto] Yes, I hope we can move forward on this.  <H5>  Technological Innovation, Source of Japan's Vitality </H5>   [Aso] The United States is now trying to build consensus  regarding the direction its people want to see for the WIPO  (World Intellectual Property Organization) treaty. Professor  Naemura, what do you think we should be anticipating from the  United States?    [Naemura] It has already been mentioned in our discussion,  but the U. S. system is very idiosyncratic.    [Aso] First of all, the United States has to be brought  around to realizing that fact.    [Naemura] It means demanding changes in the current system  in  terms of the first-to-invent principle that it embodies and in  terms of time requirements, public access, and the  domestic-foreign bias that exists in the system. On the other  hand, it means that demands will also be placed on Japan. For  example, if the principle of parity is introduced and adopted,  it will mean giving a broader interpretation in Japan to patent  claims, and so it will be necessary to build consensus in Japan  regarding such proposed changes.    [Aso] The United States is saying that Japan's patent review  process takes too long. They also want applications to be  accepted in English. Again, Japan recognizes objections from  third parties before a patent is granted. The United States  wants patents to be granted first and, then, if there are any  objections, for those matters to be dealt with later. They are  also asking for changes that would require a change in Japan's  patent laws or fundamental revisions in the way the system  operates--for example, when they say Japan's grace period is too  short or the review period for applications is too long and they  want it to be shortened.    If the United States said it would take bold steps to revise  its system, then despite some problems, Japan too would make  bold concessions. We have to approach future talks with an  attitude that says to the United States, since Japan is going to  make concessions, so should you.    [Yamamoto] I think a turning point has definitely come for  private enterprises, too. First of all, it means paying serious  attention to the system of investigating prior cases and  precedents. It means not frivolously applying for patents. And  through revisions in patent law, it means a shift which makes it  possible to apply for ideas after they've been put together and  better developed; in other words, it means a shift from quantity  to quality.    [Ito] I think it's somewhat regrettable that the message for  small and midsized enterprises may be to be very selective in  their applications for patents, and wonder if some distinctions  shouldn't be made in such cases. Of course, there's no way to  argue against the idea of quality over quantity. But I think we  also shouldn't lose sight of the fact that technological  innovation has been an essential source of the energy that has  been behind Japan's vitality.    [Aso] Yes, you're quite right. To ask applicants to be very  selective in applying for patents is apt to hold down  applications as a whole and be taken as a directive against  inventing and developing new technologies, and that certainly is  not our intention at all. We want people to keep coming up with  a lot of good ideas. But we also want them to do their homework  and look thoroughly into the matter of related, prior  inventions. The Patent Office doesn't want to be flooded with an  indiscriminate number of applications without this homework  having been done.  <H5>  Promote the Harmonization of Patent Systems and Their </H5> Application    [Aso] Mr. Yamamoto mentioned this awhile ago, but in July  1993 the Patent Office put a system into operation that is  completely electronic. As part of our database, we've already  processed some 30 million cases and made this information  available to the public. We want the fruits of this paperless  database be our common property.    [Yamamoto] Japan's Patent Office's paperless database system  seems to be the first of its kind in the world. It's important,  not only in the sense of preventing patent disputes, but also in  the sense of being forward-looking. The system will probably be  a useful reference for developing countries, too. We are looking  forward to seeing the Patent Office working together with the  appropriate countries when the time is right.    [Ito] It's splendid that a project of this scope has been  successfully carried out. From here on, the task will be to  update the system on a constant basis, and as Mr. Yamamoto said,  I hope its use can be broadened to include assistance to  developing countries.    [Naemura] I imagine that, through this system, the process  of  reviewing applications will be made much more efficient.  Naturally, that's one of the points to be appreciated. I hope  its merits will also be assessed in terms of volume.    [Aso] Right now, databases are kept separately. The United  States has its own database and the same with Europe and Japan.  So each of their respective patent offices has gotten together  and they are trying to make it so that the data can all be  mutually used. Also, since their methods are all different for  searching and looking into previous technology, hopefully, there  will be some harmonization here, too.    Another point is that views differ in respect to novelty or  originality. This is the most difficult point, and work is now  in progress in this area. In addition to harmonizing systems, I  hope energy is put into harmonizing the way the systems are put  into practice and operation.    Thank you for participating today in our discussion of so  many different issues.</p>

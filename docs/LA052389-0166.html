			<p><P> May 23, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NEW BUILDING MAY DWARF SEARS TOWER  </P> <P> A developer wants to turn the Sears Tower into the world's second-tallest  building.  </P> <P> Miglin-Beitler Developments Inc. announced plans Monday for a slender,  125-story skyscraper resembling a rocket emerging from the Loop. The 1,914-foot  structure would eclipse by 400 feet the Sears Tower.  </P> <P> The developer did not say how much the concrete and steel-reinforced skyscraper  would cost. Plans have been submitted to the Chicago Planning Commission.  </P> <P> Construction could begin by December and could be completed by mid-1992, the  developer said.  </P> <P> The building, being designed by architect Cesar Pelli, of New Haven, Conn.,  would contain 1.2 million square feet of office space, only about one-third the  rentable space of the Sears Tower.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 25, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY SUMMER;  </P> <P> RESIDENTS FINDING FUN IN THE SUN RIGHT NEAR THEIR OWN BACK YARD  </P> <P> They swarm over the tide pools like grasshoppers dipped in neon green, yellow  and pink. They trail through museums in Bermuda shorts, with visors and  cameras. They drop their trash nearly everywhere.  </P> <P> They look and act like tourists. But many of the 39.4 million tourists in  Orange County are, in fact, us.  </P> <P> "More people who live here are taking vacations within the county," said Stuart  Zanville, director of public relations at Knott's Berry Farm where more than  half the visitors are local. "Year-round schools are one reason. More  youngsters are taking part in organized summer activities that keep families in  the area. Air fares are expensive. People need more little breaks."  </P> <P> Whether hosting out of town guests or simply exploring their own back yard,  local families are rediscovering Orange County like a foreign country.  </P> <P> Alice Gharibjanians of Irvine has lived in the county for nine years but this  summer paid $14.95 for Frommer's California With Kids to read the travel advice  for Orange County. "We've been to Sea World and Disneyland. All the touristic  places." Gharibjanians said she is looking for some alternatives to lying by  the pool or lake in her Irvine neighborhood.  </P> <P> Armed with such travel guides, schedules and reservations, families are finding  lesser known and less expensive family attractions as well as fresh approaches  to enjoying Disneyland, Knott's and the museums, without crowds or tears.  </P> <P> For the second summer in a row, Santa Ana teacher Evy Disner has turned tour  guide, organizing in- and out-of-town relatives and their children into what  she calls "cousins' camp." The schedule -- including Disneyland, Knott's, the  Santa Ana Zoo and Mission San Juan Capistrano -- is full, but flexible.  </P> <P> "They have to be short trips and in the morning, so they can take naps in the  afternoon," said Disner, in sunglasses and a fanny pack as she pointed out a  statue of Father Junipero Serra at the mission to several siblings and in-laws,  two grandparents and nine children, ranging in age from 1 1/2 to 9.  </P> <P> Special days for children are held the last Saturday of the month from 10 a.m.  to 1 p.m. at the mission. They are told about early mission life through skits  and crafts such as making adobe bricks, headbands and playing Indian games.  </P> <P> A favorite of the "cousins' camp" is the La Habra Children's Museum. "They can  dress up in weird, old-fashioned clothes," Disner said. Friday, they toured the  Museum of Natural History and Science in Newport Beach.  </P> <P> To attract locals, Knott's Berry Farm has instituted a summer discount from $21  to $12 after 6 p.m. "We tested it last summer as a teen price and found a lot  of families asked if they could take advantage of it too. Dad may be working,  but he can get off early and can come to the park for dinner and a couple,  three hours of entertainment," said Stuart Zanville, public relations director.  </P> <P> Lines should be shorter this year, he said. Tourists from outside Southern  California are expected to be fewer this summer because of publicity in recent  months about malathion spraying, earthquakes and violence in general, he said.  </P> <P> For those unable to resist the "granddaddy of all the theme parks," Frommer's  suggests visiting Disneyland on Fridays and Sundays -- the lightest days during  the summer for the park. The writers suggest purchasing tickets in advance and  arriving at the 8 a.m. opening time. When it gets crowded, some people get  their hands stamped, leave the park and return at dinner time when lines are  shorter.  </P> <P> Perhaps the biggest Disneyland mistake parents make is taking children under 1  year old to the park, said Dr. Stephen Koffler, public relations director of  the American Academy of Pediatrics and a pediatrician at Hoag Health Center in  Irvine and Newport Beach. "Why spend the money? The children don't know  anything. They get scared. They can't go on rides, and if they do, they get  sick."  </P> <P> As a father, Koffler said he didn't heed his own advice and now has a photo of  his 1-year-old daughter screaming because Mickey Mouse spoke to her. Now, he  said, "I won't take my grandchildren until they're 3 or 4."  </P> <P> Koffler prefers that parents show children "real things they can relate to" in  the great outdoors, found by following the freeways and highways to local  camping spots -- at Newport Dunes and Aquatic Park or Doheny or San Clemente  state beaches.  </P> <P> Frommer's, one of the bigger names in travel guides, calls the Corona del Mar  State Beach, possibly "the best beach in the area for families."  </P> <P> At its southern edge, at the corner of Ocean Boulevard and Poppy, are the  scenic tide pools.  </P> <P> No teen-agers with boom boxes here. No surf Nazis. In fact there are barely any  waves. The only bikinis are worn by pregnant women with toddlers hanging on  their knees.  </P> <P> The most popular attractions are Hector Guajardo and Jerry Aguiar, two marine  conservationists who skin dive around the rocks every morning, plucking sea  creatures to place in a bucket for the children to see and touch.  </P> <P> This morning, the bucket holds a brittle sea star, a giant sea urchin, a  keyhole limpet and a giant sea slug that, Aguiar tells squealing girls, feels  like "3-week-old Jell-O." A suspicious 7-year-old whose carrot freckles match  her hair calls it "slimy, weird and funny."  </P> <P> They also conduct free tours of the tide pools. Reservations for groups can be  made by calling (714) 644-3047.  </P> <P> Better known by out of town tourists than locals is the Doll and Toy Museum,  1238 S. Beach Blvd. in Anaheim, located in Hobby City -- a unique six-acre  island of shops resembling a combination Santa's Village/Lake Wobegon with  train rides and picnic areas.  </P> <P> The museum, built to resemble the White House, houses an eclectic collection of  hundreds of antique dolls. Admission is $1 for adults, 50 cents for seniors and  children under 12.  </P> <P> "Oh look!" cried Jessica Melicia, 5, from San Jose. "It's Jesus!" Seconds  later: "Oh, lookit! Mr. T.!" Then, the highlight for parents and children  alike: "Oh, look! Barbie!"  </P> <P> In floor to ceiling cases, stand hundreds of Kens and Barbies representing a  visual history of the dolls' past 30 years. There is the voluptuous Barbie in a  pillbox hat and bouffant hairdo, Barbie as a Mouseketeer, Barbie in horn-rimmed  glasses. And her main accessory, Ken, in military and football uniforms,  striped pajamas and as a barbecue chef. "Oh look! What are those? Bell  bottoms?"  </P> <P> Run by Bea DeArmond, 77, who sees herself as Mother Goose, Hobby City includes  a Cabbage Patch Kids "adoption center" where "doctors and nurses" sell dolls  and accessories and issue prescriptions on the care and feeding of old dolls.  </P> <P> "If they come in dirty, they say, 'What kind of a mother are you?' " DeArmond  said.  </P> <P> A small open-air train that carries small children runs through the shops.  Picnic tables are available.  </P> <P> In most museums, "museum fatigue" usually sets in at an hour and a half for  adults, said Maxine Gaiber, public relations officer at the Newport Harbor Art  Museum. Children's interest may vary, depending on the size and type of  exhibit. "Sometimes in a science museum with buttons to push and things to do,  they may last longer." Parents should let children set their own pace, allowing  time for breaks in the cafeteria and shop, she said.  </P> <P> To help children enjoy museums, some travel mavens suggest starting with the  souvenir shop at the beginning of the visit, rather than the end. They might  purchase postcards of the exhibits and then hunt for the originals.  </P> <P> The Newport Harbor Art Museum offers a children's guide and scavenger hunt for  each show, available on request at the desk. Sample: "Sometimes Andy Warhol's  mother would handwrite on his drawings. Find a work that has handwriting on it,  write the words you see on the painting in the space below."  </P> <P> Hidden words in the Word Search Puzzles might be: "commercial art," "strawberry  Jell-O," or "Zsa Zsa Gabor."  </P> <P> More affluent families are taking short trips to hotels such as the Four  Seasons Hotel in Newport Beach that offer ultraluxurious "escape weekend"  programs.  </P> <P> "Parents are traveling more and more with their children," said Linda Barragan,  director of public relations. Parents who might spend a day or two at their  hotel when traveling alone now stay two or three nights with their children as  a result of extravagant programs that resemble summer camps, complete with  activity directors, she said. Most guests are from Southern California.  </P> <P> While parents golf or shop, the directors will take youngsters to the library  or fire station, and to the hotel kitchen to make cookies with the chef. While  parents sip champagne at brunch, children have their own $22 brunch, of hot  dogs, pizza and sundaes.  </P> <P> But no matter how luxurious the accommodations, any hotel room can be scary to  children, Koffler warned. So don't forget your child's security blanket.  </P></p>

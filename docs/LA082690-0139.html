			<p><P> August 26, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CANSECO, MCGWIRE ARE IMPRESSIVE, BUT FIELDER STEALS THE POWER SHOW  </P> <P> There were 45,474 fans on hand Saturday at Detroit for the American League  version of Home Run Derby. They weren't disappointed.  </P> <P> The best power hitters in the majors, Cecil Fielder, Jose Canseco and Mark  McGwire, all hit prodigious home runs.  </P> <P> Fielder hit two and the Tigers beat the Athletics, 14-4.  </P> <P> Fielder's first homer against Dave Stewart (17-10) came with a man on and  carried 440 feet into the left-center field seats at Tiger Stadium.  </P> <P> With one runner on in the fourth inning, Fielder joined Harmon Killebrew and  Frank Howard as the only players to hit a ball over the roof in left field.  </P> <P> Fielder has a major league-leading 41 home runs and 108 runs batted in.  Canseco, who hit a 450-foot home run, has 35, and McGwire, whose homer reached  the upper deck, has 33. They hit consecutive homers off Frank Tanana in the  first inning. DAN HAFNER  </P></p>

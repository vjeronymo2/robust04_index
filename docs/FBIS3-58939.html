Government spokesman Dieter Vogel announced in Bonn that the  Federal Government received information in mid-December that two  containers with ammonium perchlorate were being transported from  China to Beirut. The freight was described as harmless material  in the manifest, whereas in fact it was fuel ingredients for the  Iraqi missile program.</p>

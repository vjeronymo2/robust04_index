			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The classes are exclusive. For example, the stripping of 50 linear feet of thermal system insulation, which has not been positively identified as non-asbestos containing material is Class I, for it is the removal of PACM. Repair of a valve covered by ACM is Class III, since ``removal'' is not taking place. Removal of roofing material containing ACM is Class II, since roofing material is not high-risk ACM. OSHA believes dividing activities by ``Classes'' will be clearer than the prior system in the 1986 standard which prescribed different precautions for ``small scale, short duration work,'' which it then defined by example. As noted in several places in this document this was confusing to employers, to the Court and to OSHA itself. A more extensive discussion of the ``Class'' system of designating work with asbestos-containing materials is contained in the discussion on ``Methods of Compliance'' provisions later in this preamble.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Class IV work is defined as maintenance and custodial activities during which employees contact ACM and PACM and activities to clean up waste and debris containing ACM and PACM. This includes dusting surfaces, vacuuming carpets, mopping floors, cleaning up ACM or PACM materials from thermal system insulation or surfacing ACM/PACM. Workers may contact ACM or PACM when performing a wide variety of routine jobs that result in incidental disturbance, such as changing a battery in a smoke detector attached to a ceiling containing ACM or PACM, polishing floors containing asbestos, and changing a light bulb in a fixture attached to an asbestos containing ceiling.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For custodial work, the Class IV characterization applies to situations where there is an indication that surfaces are contaminated with ACM or PACM. One indication would be identification of the ACM or PACM sources of the debris or dust; such as visibly damaged, or degraded, ACM or PACM in the vicinity. Visibly damaged, degraded, or friable ACM or PACM are indications that surface dust could contain asbestos, and Class IV protection applies. OSHA requires in (g)(9) that such dust or debris be assumed to be ACM or PACM. Another indication could be an analytical test to determine whether the surface dust itself contains asbestos. Since dust of carpets may not be visible, visible dust on other surfaces along with the presence of ACM/PACM nearby would indicate that cleaning the carpet is Class IV work.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The general industry standard also includes requirements for maintenance and custodial operations which mirror Class IV requirements in the construction standard. These would apply to activities which are not traditionally viewed as construction activities, and which, as contended by certain participants in this proceeding, may not be covered by the Construction Safety Act (40 U.S.C. 333). As further discussed in the preamble discussion relating to paragraph (a), Scope and Application, examples of these activities are clean-up in areas where asbestos-containing dust or debris is present and removing light fixtures located near ``high risk'' surfacing material.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

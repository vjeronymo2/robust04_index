			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Leonid Zavarskiy and Yevgeniy Ostapov, under the </F> "Plans of Cessna Aircraft for Russia" rubric: "The American  Debut Will Hardly Draw a Full House"]    [Text] A market for business jets [here and  henceforth rendered in English in the original]--small jet  planes which amount simultaneously to a flying office and  recreation room (see KOMMERSANT-DAILY for 5 February)--which has  evolved in Russia has prompted a fit of activity on the part of  Western producers of such aircraft. The American company Cessna  Aircraft, which is holding a presale traveling show of its  latest business jet, the Citation VII, even resolved to make an  unplanned stop in Russia. However, the Russian debut of the  company--a two-day presentation of the plane, which ended  yesterday--indicated that the feverish haste in the hope of  getting the Russian market does not guarantee success in and of  itself.    Cessna Aircraft was founded in December 1927. The  headquarters of the company is located in the city of Wichita  (Texas) [as published]. The company produces small propeller and  jet planes. During its existence, it has produced about 20,000  planes (it sells up to 110 jet planes annually). The A-37 light  ground-attack jet plane is one of its best-known models.  Recently, the company has been involved in manufacturing  business jets, which have a 60-percent share on the American  aviation market.    Unscheduled travel by air that is more comfortable than in  first class and has long been popular among the Russian captains  of industry and is becoming increasingly popular among major  private businessmen calls for adequate equipment. However,  Cessna has hardly selected the best site for its first  appearance in Russia: The State Scientific-Research Institute of  Civil Aviation is located almost 40 kilometers away from Moscow.  The Americans ended up quite a "distance" from their main  competitors in Russia--the French Dassault Aviation and British  Aerospace, whose Falcon-900 and BAe-125 planes have already  received Russian airworthiness certificates. Besides, the cabin  of the Citation VII model has smaller dimensions than the  competing planes and is therefore less comfortable. Also, the  range of the British and French planes is almost twice as long  (see the box), which is important under Russian conditions. This  is why the success of Cessna on the Russian market is uncertain.    The market itself looks quite interesting at present.  Neither  the old obstacles to the flights of business jets nor the  restrictions on passengers to be carried exist anymore. The  issue is how to take advantage of existing opportunities. Any  Russian businessman who has the necessary funds may now acquire  a business jet for personal use. However, its cost as a rule  exceeds $10 million, and one hour of flight costs almost $1,000.  Only the largest companies--Ford, GM, or Fiat--or eccentric  zillionaires such as Armand Hammer or Robert [as published] von  Karajan (the latter prefers to sit at the controls himself) have  their own planes of this class in the West. Businessmen usually  charter a plane from a small company engaging in the unscheduled  carriage of VIP's. About 40 such companies already exist in the  CIS, and all sufficiently large airports are able to receive  business jets (four or five of them land at Sheremetyevo-2 every  day).    As far as prospects for the acquisition of Western business  jets are concerned, under the new customs tariff introduced on  15 March, the purchase will cost 50 percent more (at present,  this problem concerns, for example, the head of the AvtoVAZ  [Volga Automotive Plant], Vladimir Kadanikov, who has only a  refurbished YaK-40 at his disposal). Leasing is likely to appear  preferable from now on.    [Begin boxed item]  <H5>  Planes of the Business Jet Class in Russia </H5>   About 20 Falcon-900's (eight to 14 passengers, takeoff  weight  29 tonnes, cabin dimensions 11.9 by 2.34 by 1.87 meters, range  7,400 kilometers) and BAe-125-800's (eight passengers, 10  tonnes, 6.5 by 1.85 by 1.85 meters, 5,600 kilometers) which were  certified last year in keeping with Russian airworthiness norms  have already been purchased in the CIS. Private and state  companies (the Gazprom purchased one Falcon-900) and a few  airlines were the buyers.    The analogous characteristics of the Citation VII (see the  picture) are six to eight passengers, 10 tonnes, 5.5 by 1.7 by  1.7 meters, 4,200 kilometers. The base price is $8 million-$10  million, which is approximately 30 percent below the prices of  the competition.    More than 100 planes (mostly the YaK-40 and the Tu-134) have  been converted into business jets in Russia. At present, there  are no obstacles to operating Russian or foreign equipment of  this class; however, a lengthy and inconvenient procedure exists  for obtaining flight licenses. The adoption of relevant  legislative documents is expected this year.    [End boxed item]</p>

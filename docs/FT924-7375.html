			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Arts: Margaret Price - Recital With the champagne glasses from the gala re-opening night cleared away, the Wigmore Hall is settling back to work. One of the facilities improved during the refurbishment is the radio room and it was good to see the BBC taking Friday's recital for future relay. This first full recital was awarded to Margaret Price, a gesture well deserved. The Welsh soprano is the leading British exponent of song on the international platform. At her finest, she is a recitalist of exemplary virtues, like an author who writes immaculate prose or an actress who declaims Shakespeare with perfect eloquence. Music and poetry flow together on a silver stream of tone: pure singing of the highest standard. Unfortunately, this was not one of those best evenings. As can happen to anybody, the singer found herself in less than her easiest voice. The programme opened with Mendelssohn, in which the hoped-for purity of sound refused to appear. To compensate, she gave voice and temperament freer rein, resulting in bigger, breathy and rather hearty singing, when these light-footed songs about elves and nightingales really ask to dance on a pin-head. Only when the focus of the voice came true did the nightingale in Price sing out. Two Schumann songs, 'Der Sandmann' and 'Des Sennen Abschied", were especially beautiful, because the voice slimmed down to its expressive core. There were good things, too, in her Frank Bridge group, such as the distant calling across the fields in 'Mantle of blue', but the main pleasure here came in discovering what lovely songs these are. Why do we not hear them more often? In her recent recital appearances Margaret Price has tended to favour German Lieder in her programmes, so the inclusion of the Bridge was a welcome change, as was her rare performance of Britten's song-cycle The Poet's Echo. This was properly impassioned singing. With Graham Johnson providing keenly dramatised accompaniments on the Wigmore's new Bosendorfer piano, she found both the music's cold Russian landscape and its burning inner heart. For encores, Britten folksong arrangements (a haunting 'Ca' the yowes') and Finzi. Then, to finish, 'Oliver Cromwell', a favourite Price encore, in which she promptly got lost and stopped the show, to audience delirium, with a spontaneous expletive. The chances are this was the first time a four-letter word has ever been uttered in the Wigmore Hall: it has duly been christened]</p>

			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / CBI urges wide reform of Tecs THE Confederation of British Industry yesterday criticised the government for being too prescriptive in the detailed running of Training and Enterprise Councils, while failing to give them strategic leadership. The CBI's criticisms are contained in a policy document on employer-led Tecs, which administer government-funded training programmes in England and Wales. The criticisms will be discussed at the CBI's annual conference in Harrogate next week. The report expressed broad support for Tecs, which spend Pounds 2bn of public funds, but highlighted up to 50 areas where the CBI believed there was need for reform. Proposals directed at the government, Tecs and in some instances Local Enterprise Companies included: A thorough review of the contracts between the government and Tecs, and a parallel exercise to simplify the administrative requirements Tecs imposed on suppliers. Funding of Tecs through an intermediary council, rather than directly by the department of employment. A clearer government statement of the role of Tecs. More local accountability, with codes of best practice to ensure greater local involvement. The report also gave an implicit warning to the government that it should not strip Tecs of their responsibility for Youth Training. The Department for Education has sought to transfer more than half of Youth Training's budget to its further education colleges. The CBI said the government's new emphasis on Tecs' enterprise role should 'not be interpreted as making training a secondary priority, but should require a new balance to be struck'.</p>

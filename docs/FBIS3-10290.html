A special prosecutor demands money from the potential  targets  of his investigation, and others do not attend court proceedings  and later allow court orders to be falsified.    Investigations and arrests are overturned because of  inconsistencies, as in Adelina Mesa's case, who was accused of a  terrorist attack in Bogota, and prosecutors are blamed for  inconsistencies in a number of cases.    All these episodes seem to have finally exhausted the  patience of Attorney General Carlos Gustavo Arrieta. His staff  is now handling 1,200 investigations of prosecutors. In a letter  to Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff, he revealed the  system's Achilles heel: arbitrary actions and negligence on the  part of a number of prosecutors.    Arrieta issued a forceful criticism: some prosecutors  initiate legal action hastily and without solid evidence,  thereby violating the principle of [presumed] innocence and due  process.    In his letter, the attorney general announced the immediate  start of new investigations because these abuses still persist,  even though in May 1993 he had issued warnings concerning these  abuses, also in a letter to the prosecutor general.    De Greiff agrees that there are serious irregularities in  the  work of some of his subordinates, but says they do not reach the  extreme cited by the Attorney General's Office.    "We," De Greiff told EL TIEMPO, "do not conceal anything  from  a sense of esprit de corps; we do not protect people because  they are in the Prosecutor General's Office. We are not saints,  but we try to be."    During his 18 months at the Prosecutor General's Office, De  Greiff has investigated 656 prosecutors in internal procedures.  To date 238 investigations have been concluded; 418 are still  under way.  <H5>  Director of Prosecution Offices </H5>   The National Director of Prosecution Offices, Ana Montes,  who  coordinates prosecutors all over the country and whose office  maintains statistics on decisions issued by prosecutors acting  as trial judges, has her own view of the matter.    Montes agrees that "it is time to look at what is going on,"  but she explains that many of the complaints are filed when the  party affected by a decision calls for a disciplinary or penal  investigation against the prosecutor.    Still, the Attorney General's Office believes that the  problem goes far beyond that. As an example, they say that  prosecutors have been initiating legal proceedings against  municipal officials who in the end prove their innocence.    "On many occasions ignorance of administrative contracting  provisions and regulations or of budget systems has caused legal  action to be initiated and municipal officials to be suspended  who later (...) must be returned to office."    "All this," explains the attorney general, "could be avoided  if prosecutors studied the situation thoroughly before  initiating legal proceedings."    However, De Greiff and Arrieta both seem to agree that the  time has come to apply a firm hand.</p>

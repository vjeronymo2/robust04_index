			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / International Company News: Caisse d'Epargne net slides 14% to FFr2bn CAISSE d'Epargne, the French network of savings banks, yesterday highlighted the pressures on France's banking sector by publishing provisional results for 1992 which indicated a 14 per cent fall in net profits to FFr2bn (Dollars 370m). Mr Rene Barberye, chairman of Caisse d'Epargne, the main savings institution in France, said the profits reduction reflected the financial impact of the company's attempts to modernise its activities by investing in new management systems and technology. Net profits were FFr2.5bn on net banking income of FFr23.3bn in 1991, a year in which its overall costs settled at FFr17.8bn. Mr Barberye did not indicate the likely level of sales and costs for 1992 but said operating profits fell by between 7 per cent and 8 per cent during the year. The profits warning from Caisse d'Epargne is the latest in a stream of gloomy announcements from the French banks, which are being squeezed by the dual impact of the economic slowdown and the crisis in the French property market. Paribas, one of the most prestigious investment banks, last week announced that it had returned to the black with net profits of around FFr900m in 1992, but had been forced to make heavy provisions.</p>

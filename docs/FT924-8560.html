			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Survey of Computers in Finance (13): Open strategy for survival - Profile of Winter Partners AFTER a staggering period of expansion and prosperity in the mid-1980s, international financial institutions face a tough time in the current world recession. Expansion plans have been postponed, especially those for information technology, and even the usually recession-proof software industry has found it hard to maintain the heady growth of a decade ago. The world recession has coincided with a sea change in the structure of the computer industry - with leaders such as IBM and DEC laying off staff and their customers looking for ways to reduce costs. The trend towards downsizing and open systems is fundamental to this change. The Swiss-based banking software supplier Winter Partners sees open systems as the best way to survive in tight market conditions. It started work on moving its main software packages to open systems in 1989 and expects to deliver the first results next year. The development would have been achieved faster, had it not been for the company strategy of extending the scope of its packages, at the same time as broadening its potential market by taking the software to other computer systems. 'We have a two-pronged approach: firstly, we are moving the products to Unix platforms for open systems; and secondly, we are introducing more functions to meet the needs of our customers,' says Mr Keith Williams, general manager of Winter Partners' UK-based IBS-90 division. 'This is essential in the current market conditions, which are the worst I have ever known. Although we are still selling systems, we are seeing volumes between 30 and 40 per cent off - which I believe is typical in the rest of the industry,' Mr Williams says. With software installed in 400 sites across 35 countries, Winter Partners has shown that it is possible, however, to ride the ups and downs of international finance by spreading its net wide. Founded in 1970, Winter Partners is a privately-held Swiss software company, with a minority interest held by Electrowatt AG. In its last financial year Winter Partners reported total gross revenues of SFr36m, (Dollars 26.4m) earned from selling banking software packages and management consultancy. Revenues are split evenly between the two areas  - although, in most cases, the consultancy effort is linked to Winter Partners own products. Winter Partners sells three different software packages: Bancos, a package for private banks, sold mainly in Switzerland and mainland Europe; RIBS, a package for building specialised applications such as portfolio management, again sold mainly in Europe; IBS-90, the company's flagship package which covers all aspects of international banking and sold worldwide. Development work on IBS-90 is carried out in the UK - including the effort to move the software to Unix-based open hardware. The UK connection is the result of an important acquisition and the company was virtually unknown in the UK until April 1987 when it took over Arbat, a leading UK banking software company. The surprise takeover pushed Winter Partners into the headlines and increased its international profile. After steady growth through the 1970s, Winter Partners started its expansion phase with the aim of becoming a world player in the banking software market in 1980. Since then, it has achieved a strong position in its European 'home' market and in the Far East. In 1990, it expanded once more, this time into the US market. It now has offices in most big banking centres including the UK, Singapore, Hong Kong and the US. Its customers include 50 of the world's top 200 financial institutions with names such as Barclays Bank, Kleinwort Benson, the Bank of England and National Westminster Bank at the top of the list. Winter Partners has also taken up the challenge of the emerging market in the former eastern bloc countries of Europe and has sold its software to five banks in Hungary and one in Poland. The takeover of Arbat in 1987 brought Winter Partners a valuable prize - Arbat's International Banking System (IBS) software package, which runs on DEC's VAX minicomputer. The scalability of the DEC VAX has let Winter Partners to sell its software into a wide range of financial institutions. In April 1990, Winter signed a co-operative marketing agreement with DEC to promote a re-vamped package under its current name IBS-90. Over the past two years Winter Partners has invested an average of 30 per cent of its revenues in continued development of the package. More importantly, it recognised the opportunity presented by emerging open systems hardware and embarked on a project to re-write the IBS-90 software to exploit this. The UK development team is re-writing the IBS-90 modules in the 'C' programming language, which is closely associated with open Unix systems. Once all the program code has been converted, it will be simple to tailor it to a specific Unix system. The package consists of a large number of modules which can be used to build an 'integrated' system for the international wholesale banking business. It covers front and back office operations, in addition to providing management information statistics and analyses. It includes modules to handle everything from treasury exposure management, through foreign exchange, to interest rate swaps and marketable securities. There are also modules to handle commercial lending and credit control and business development analysis. IBS-90 can link to the Swift network. Winter Partners expects the first sales of the open version of IBS-90 to go its traditional market based on DEC minicomputers. DEC is committed to making its DEC VAX range compatible with emerging open systems and Winter Partners' long-established relationship with DEC will stand it in good stead. 'But we will not be limited to just DEC as we are now,' says Mr Williams. 'Now the programs are nearly all converted to 'C', we can look for a broader market - depending on what choice our customers make.' By the third quarter of next year, when the first open IBS-90 packages are scheduled to be installed, times might not be quite so hard. But, whatever happens, the growth of open systems as the basis for future applications software, will give Winter Partners an important new market to sell into.</p>

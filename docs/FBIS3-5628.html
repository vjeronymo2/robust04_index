Representatives of the joint venture initialed the agreement  in a signing session Wednesday.    Kajima is one of eight major general contractors at the  center of investigations into a series of bribery scandals  involving politicians and construction firms.    Nagano is among a number of municipal and prefectural  governments that had held off for a while on concluding  contracts with the firms involved in the scandals.    But Nagano city officials approved the pact with the  Kajima-led joint venture even though a former Kajima vice  president was arrested again Tuesday for his suspected  involvement in the alleged sending of a 10 million yen bribe to  former Construction Minister Kishiro Nakamura.    The officials said the city's sanctions against Kajima were  not relevant since the arrested Kajima executive, Shinji  Kiyoyama, was not a representative of the leading construction  firm at the time of arrest.    The city invited bids last July for the design and  construction of the rink that will be the site of the speed  skating events in the 1998 Winter Olympic Games.    The five-member joint venture led by Kajima had been  scheduled to begin work in February, but conclusion of the  contract was delayed because the city had held off signing  contacts with Kajima until February 25.    On Tuesday, prosecutors arrested Kiyoyama for allegedly  providing a 10 million yen bribe to Nakamura, a House of  Representatives member, for his help in heading off a Fair Trade  Commission criminal complaint on a bid-rigging cartel in Saitama  Prefecture in 1992.    Prosecutors are asking the Diet to lift immunity on Nakamura  so they can arrest him.</p>

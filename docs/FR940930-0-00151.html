			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> CARB's 3.5 g/Bhp-hr NMHC+NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> x <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  standard is the only other impetus driving technology to achieve emission levels significantly below the 4.0 g/Bhp-hr NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> x <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  standard. Engine manufacturers have stated that the CARB 1998 3.5 g/Bhp-hr NMHC+NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> x <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  standard for incomplete medium-duty vehicles and diesel engines is feasible, and EPA agrees with CARB's expectation that manufacturers will market a range of LEV diesel HDEs in California which will meet the California standard. However, as with the federal 4.0 g/Bhp-hr NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> x <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  standard, it is unlikely the current California standard will prompt the additional technology development needed to reach a 3.15 g/Bhp-hr NMHC+NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> x <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  level since there is no requirement to reach levels below 3.5 g/Bhp-hr NMHC+NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> x <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . This is especially true for engines intended for vehicles between 14,000 and 26,000 pounds GVWR, which are covered by the Clean Fuel Fleet Program but not the current CARB LEV program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA believes it is appropriate to look at the demand that will be created for heavy-duty CFVs as a relevant factor when determining whether a particular combined NMHC+NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> x <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  standard for diesel-fueled vehicles is technologically feasible under section 245(b)(1). For the reasons discussed above, EPA believes that achieving a level of 3.15 g/Bhp-hr NMHC+NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> x <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  for even a small selection of HDDEs by 1998 will be a very difficult task. Manufacturers will need to invest significantly in research and accelerated technology development, and any engines which reach production would be more costly (in terms of both engine price increase and fuel economy penalty, as discussed above), especially based on the relatively small demand that will be created by the Clean Fuel Fleet Program. In the absence of mandated production, EPA believes that a technological effort of this magnitude is likely to be undertaken by engine manufacturers only under circumstances of a certain, substantial market.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The CFF program contains no authority for a production mandate. Thus, the size and certainty of the market is central to whether diesel engines will be developed to meet the requirements of heavy-duty fleets covered by the fleet program. However, only a small number of vehicles will be needed by fleets for their fleet program purchase requirements. For example, during each year of the fleet program EPA estimates that a maximum of only about 2 percent (10,000) of total nationwide new heavy-duty diesel vehicles will be purchased by fleet operators to meet the Clean Fuel Fleet Program requirements. <FOOTCITE>23</FOOTCITE>  This projected market decreases by about 25 percent if California opts out of the Clean Fuel Fleet Program; other potential opt outs by additional states may reduce the market to under one percent of nationwide heavy-duty diesel engine sales (or under about 5000 vehicles). By comparison, based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the implementation schedule of CARB's LEV program, the annual market (30,000) for vehicles required to meet CARB's LEV standard for diesel engines and incomplete medium duty-vehicles of 3.5 g/Bhp-hr NMHC+NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> x <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is approximately three to six times as large as the potential federal clean diesel-fueled market. <FOOTCITE>24</FOOTCITE>  CARB's program incorporates a phased-in percentage sales mandate for this larger number of vehicles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 23 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Mobile Sources, ``Estimated Number of Fleet Vehicles Affected by the Clean Fuel Fleet Program,'' Memorandum from Sheri Dunatchik to Docket A&hyph;91&hyph;25, June 11, 1991. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 24 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Heavy-duty vehicle population projections for the California LEV program are based on the following: (1) light heavy-duty production reports submitted to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for model year 1991 and (2) New Truck Registrations by Manufacturer and State data from the ``AAMA Facts and Figures 1993'' (page 27) that shows California truck sales to be 10 percent of nationwide truck sales. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA is concerned that a market of the size represented by the CFF program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will not be seen as sufficient for engine manufacturers to justify the major voluntary technological development efforts necessary to reach a 3.15 g/Bhp-hr standard. Even if some manufacturers do launch such an effort, the likely higher cost and possible fuel economy penalty may make it much more difficult for diesel engine producers to compete for sales with gasoline or alternative fueled engine options which may be available. Since developing and producing vehicles for the fleet program is, by statute, voluntary, the Agency believes that it is very possible that, with a very low emission standard, no diesels will be produced for the clean fuel fleet program. The Act is clear in its intention that EPA may design the fleet program such that clean diesel vehicles can participate. EPA thus concludes that a standard of 3.15 g/Bhp-hr is not feasible for heavy-duty diesel-fueled CFVs taking into account costs, lead time, durability, and other relevant factors, and should not be promulgated at this time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA reserves the right to reconsider through rulemaking the 3.15 g/Bhp-hr NMHC+NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> x <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  standard at a later time if diesel NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> x <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  control technology and the HD clean-fuel engine market develop to a point which would make this level feasible for heavy-duty diesel-fueled CFVs. Such a reconsideration may be prompted by developments in the ongoing CARB HD LEV program now under consideration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ii.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> NMHC+NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> x <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> LEV standard. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  EPA is adopting an approach for the heavy-duty clean fuel vehicle engine standard that is very similar to the proposed approach. The intent of this approach is to implement a challenging standard in a way that harmonizes as completely as possible the federal standard with CARB's NMHC+NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> x <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  LEV standard for diesel engines and incomplete medium-duty vehicles. The Agency believes that the effect of this harmonization is to make the overall national market for clean HDDs significantly larger than it would be with either program alone and will thus assure that clean diesels will in fact be produced by 1998 for the clean fuel fleet program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

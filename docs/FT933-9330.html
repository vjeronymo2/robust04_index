			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / International Company News: Dresdner Bank shows mid-term improvement DRESDNER BANK, Germany's second-largest commercial bank, yesterday reported a 14 per cent rise in group operating profits to DM936m (Dollars 544.10m) in the first half of this year after a big rise in loan risk provisions. The result, from the last of the big three German banks to report interim figures, is in line with the much-improved figures reported by its domestic competitors. Commerzbank's group operating result was 16 per cent higher at DM392m, while Deutsche Bank showed a 13 per cent increase to DM2.6bn. Both the Dresdner and Deutsche comparisons are with half of the full 1992 result rather than with the calendar January - June period. One reason for the banks' stronger performance during the recession is the steep rise in commission income, reflecting stronger securities trading. Despite the weaker economy and high German interest rates, Dresdner said short and long-term lending had increased. Operating profits at the Dresdner parent bank were 12 per cent higher at DM661m. Provisions for bad loan risks, which German banks are now releasing in more detail ahead of the implementation of a new EC banking directive, rose by 25 per cent to DM758m for the group and by 27 per cent to DM554m for the parent bank. Business in eastern Germany, where economic progress after unification has fallen well short of expectations, accounted for most of Dresdner's risk provisions. But bank officials said that these had been strengthened because of the continuing unsettled state of the domestic economy. Dresdner's group lending volume rose by 4 per cent to DM250bn, with business volume 8 per cent higher at DM359bn. The parent bank's own lending increased by nearly 5 per cent to DM146bn, comprising a 5 per cent rise in the short and medium-term sector and one of 3 per cent in long-term corporate business.</p>

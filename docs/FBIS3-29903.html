Hayami said the government should break the deadlock on  economic "framework" talks between Japan and the United States  by setting a ratio to Japan's gross domestic product (GDP) in  reducing its trade surplus.    Hayami said such a goal should be included in a plan that  the  government will announce to open up Japan's markets.    He made the remark at a press conference in reference to the  recent failed trade talks between Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton over setting "objective  criteria" in bilateral trade.    The association has repeatedly urged the government to try  to  correct the price gap between goods sold in and outside Japan.    He also said the dollar's value should be around 110 yen,  noting there are few Japanese firms that can survive if the  dollar remains below 110 yen.</p>

			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Lex Service accelerates 33% A LARGER share of more buoyant markets helped Lex Service, the UK's largest car distribution and leasing company, report interim profits up by 33 per cent yesterday. Sir Trevor Chinn, chairman, forecast 'considerably higher' new car registrations this year. Profit before tax and exceptional items increased from Pounds 16m to Pounds 21.2m in the six months to June 27 reflecting improving demand in the car and truck markets. After exceptional items - including disposal of the Volvo import concession in 1992 which resulted in a Pounds 63.7m exceptional gain and the sale of Arrow Electronics shares in the latest period which generated a Pounds 60.1m exceptional gain - the group showed pre-tax profits under the new FRS 3 accounting rules of Pounds 81.6m (Pounds 84.9m). Earnings per share excluding the exceptional items increased from 10.5p to 13.3p and the interin dividend is lifted from 4p to 4.7p. Including exceptionals earnings slipped to 74.8p (78.5p) per share. Profits in the latest period also included a non-recurring Pounds 2.6m for the period October to December reflecting the decision of the group's contract hire joint ventures to change their accounting year end. Excluding this, and adjusting for the loss of the Volvo import concession, pre-tax profit before exceptionals rose 36 per cent to Pounds 18.6m. Sir Trevor said group car dealerships throughout Britain were reporting 'a very encouraging level of orders for August,' traditionally the busiest month of the year for new car registrations. He said total August registrations could be up by over 10 per cent on last August. COMMENT With yesterday's acquisition of the Arlington dealerships Lex has consolidated its position as UK's largest car retailing group. Meanwhile, the Hyundai concession, while tiny in comparison to Volvo, gives Lex a foothold back in the import business. Overall, however, it is new car sales which drive the business - since they generate after sales revenues and second-hand car sales. If the optimism on this score proves correct the timing of Lex's latest acquisition will look sweet. Pre-tax profits this year, excluding the exceptionals, should reach between Pounds 37m and Pounds 40m, equivalent to minimum earnings of 25p a share. On that basis the shares are trading on a prospective p/e of 16.7.</p>

			<p><P> November 6, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> ROCK HUDSON INSURER NOT LIABLE  </P> <P> A federal judge has ruled that Rock Hudson's insurance company, Aetna, is not  liable for the $14.5-million judgment awarded by a jury to the late actor's  lover, a lawyer said today.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge A. Wallace Tashima, in issuing his ruling here Monday,  found that because Hudson never told Marc Christian that he had AIDS, the  actor's insurance coverage does not apply.  </P> <P> As a result, Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co. will have to pay no part of the  award.  </P> <P> Aetna will also not be responsible for the legal costs of the ongoing appeal of  the February, 1989, verdict against Hudson's estate, Aetna attorney Michael  Leahy said.  </P></p>

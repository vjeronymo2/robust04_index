			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] It has already been reported that Valeriy Zorkin has  resumed his duties as a Constitutional Court judge. Yelena  Sandomirskaya reports:    [Sandomirskaya] According to Valeriy Dmitriyevich himself,  he  did not stop his work in the Constitutional Court, as he regards  the decision on his forcible removal as unjust and legally  incorrect, which is, I would like to note, not the same thing.  But all this is in the past. Today Judge Valeriy Zorkin has  new problems: to draw up a draft law on the Constitutional  Court and to elect its chairman. As to the new Russian  constitution, Valeriy Zorkin said that he has always criticized  it. But because it is considered to have been adopted, there is  nothing else to do but to protect the new main law. Valeriy  Zorkin said that being a judge who always respects the law, he  will guard any other constitution. I hope that the defense  process will be held within the court and not far outside its  framework -- this is what Judge Valeriy Zorkin promised.</p>

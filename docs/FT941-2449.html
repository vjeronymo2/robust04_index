			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / Business Travel: Rooms where class matters - Michael Skapinker explains what you can expect if you stay on a hotel's executive floor If you stay on the Executive floor of the Brussels Hilton, your bathroom mirror will have a heated unit behind it to stop it misting up. On the Crown Club floor of London's Grosvenor House hotel, you will be attended by staff who are paid more than those on other floors to ensure that you get even better attention. The class system, so firmly established on the world's airlines, has now arrived at Europe's top hotels. There are five-star hotels, promising business travellers every comfort, service and convenience. And there are designated floors within five-star hotels offering even more comfort, service and convenience - at a price. Executive floors have been a feature of Asian hotels for several years, but are becoming increasingly common in the US and Europe. Today, the Club floor of the Churchill Inter-Continental, near London's Oxford Street, opens for business. For Pounds 210 a night for a single room  -about Pounds 25 more than you would pay elsewhere in the hotel - you can use the exclusive Club floor check-in desk, instead of the one in the lobby. Club floor guests also have their own lounge, offering complimentary breakfast and evening cocktails. There is also a library on the floor, and a fax and modem socket in each bedroom. Guests have a valet to unpack their suitcases, and their clothes are pressed without charge. A meeting room is also provided free of charge, subject to availability. Inter-Continental recently opened a similar floor at its hotel in Frankfurt. At first sight, the offerings of the Churchill Inter-Continental's Club floor do not look particularly enticing. The private lounge is small and the view from it is uninspiring. The 'library' is even smaller, with a glass-fronted bookcase in it. Club guest rooms resemble other five-star hotel rooms and, although they have the promised modem and fax sockets, so, it appears, do the other rooms in the hotel. The idea behind executive floors in top hotels is a strange one. Hotels already offer different levels of service at graded prices. If the service offered by the five-star hotels is not required, or is too expensive, you can always stay in a two or three-star hotel. But if you do elect to pay five-star rates, you expect the service that goes with it. If those paying even more for an executive floor in a five-star hotel receive the sort of service that makes doing business possible, what sort of service are guests on other floors getting? Mr Geoffrey Breeze, vice-president of Hilton International, which offers Clubroom, 'a new service focus' at more than 60 of its hotels, explains: 'Almost all Hilton International hotels are business-oriented and all of our guests receive service of the highest standards. One in 10 of our guests request executive floor accommodation. This customer requires extra services, immediately to hand, and is more likely to use the hotel as a base for business. 'While we would like for the other nine to get a taste for executive floors, we are committed to providing all customers with the same quality of service.' Got it? Ms Melanie Baker, Inter-Continental's communications director, says the attraction of an executive floor is that it offers guests the personal attention of a small 'boutique' hotel, while still providing the facilities of a large five-star establishment. 'It offers the person travelling on business more of a private club. It's a privacy issue.' Ms Vanessa Leak, head of travel management marketing at Thomas Cook, says access to a smaller lounge on the same floor as the bedroom is particularly attractive to women. Mr Neil Kirby, deputy general manager of the Grosvenor House, puts it this way. A room on the Grosvenor House executive floor costs Pounds 45 more than elsewhere in the hotel. But the executive floor price includes breakfast, which will cost you Pounds 13.95 if you are staying on one of the other floors. On the executive floor there is also free use of the minibar, he says, and room service lunch or dinner is provided free. Free clothes pressing is also offered - a service you have to pay for if you are on one of the other floors. Moreover, on the executive floor of the Grosvenor you get free use of the meeting room. In most London hotels this would cost Pounds 250 to Pounds 300 a day. The executive floor provides a package of services, which, as a business traveller, you might otherwise have to pay for individually. The final cost therefore is unlikely to be greater than staying elsewhere in the hotel. The hotels are convinced their guests view the service this way, because demand for executive floors is strong. Far from being a passing fad, special floors are here to stay, they say. Airlines know what this means. Offer two classes and those in the cheaper one will ask for an upgrade. Do hotels allow ordinary guests to upgrade to executive floor without paying extra? 'Definitely not,' is the response from the reception desk on the Churchill Inter-Continental's executive floor. Mr Kirby concurs: 'We don't upgrade.' Never? 'Unless it's a very regular customer.' While London hotels say business is picking up, occupancy elsewhere in Europe is still low. Ask for an upgrade to the executive floor. What have you got to lose?</p>

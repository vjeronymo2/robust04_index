			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / International Company News: Charge hits shares at US brewery SHARES in Anheuser-Busch, the US brewery and food group, slid in New York yesterday morning after the company announced that it would post a loss in the third quarter as a result of a one-time pre-tax charge of Dollars 565m. The company said the provision, which works through at about Dollars 1.26 a share, would cover the cost of implementing a package of 'significant organisational and operational changes'. In the third quarter of 1992, Anheuser-Busch posted net income of Dollars 318m, or Dollars 1.12. The announcement, which had come after the close of the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday, triggered a sharp reaction when the market opened yesterday, with the share price falling Dollars 2 to Dollars 43 5/8 in early trading. In the most prominent feature of the plan, the company will reduce salaried staff by 10 per cent, or about 1,200 workers, by the end of next year. It said it hoped to achieve the cuts primarily through attrition and an early retirement package to be offered to employees aged 53 or older.</p>

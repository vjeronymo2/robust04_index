			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Kirill Dybskiy: ``Cholera Vibrio has Grown Up in </F> Moscow'']    [Text] An unprecedented outbreak of acute  infectious diseases, including cholera, was documented this  summer in Russia. This week a focus of infection was revealed in  Moscow. A press conference held by the Russian State Committee  for Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight (GKSEN) was devoted to an  analysis of the alarming situation now developing.    As was noted by Aleksandr Monisov, deputy chairman of the  GKSEN and assistant Russian chief state public health physician,  the epidemiological situation in Russia can be characterized  today as alarming. This is associated primarily with interstate  migration of the population within the CIS and abroad, and with  expansion of the channels of exchange of freight, goods, food  products and agricultural raw materials. Outbreaks and spreading  of dangerous infectious diseases such as plague, yellow fever,  typhoid fever and especially cholera have been observed in this  connection. Thus, an unprecedented cholera outbreak was observed  in 1992--El Tor Ogava vibrio was discovered in 68 countries of  the world, with the total number of patients being 461,000  persons (see table). This year 118,000 patients were revealed in  6 months. The largest proportion of infected individuals is  found in the countries of the Near and Central East--Pakistan,  Afghanistan, India, Turkey, Syria. An outbreak of cholera was  recently noted in a number of regions of Latin America as well.       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |World Cholera Morbidity From 1983 to 1992 (Thousands of Cases)               |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1983                                  |64                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1984-1989                             |29-48                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1990                                  |70                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1991                                  |594                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1992                                  |461.7                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      As Mr Monisov noted, Russia has not been spared this fate  either. The last 3 years were extremely strained for Russian  epidemiologists: Following a mass outbreak of cholera in 1990 in  Stavropol imported from Syria (49 persons fell ill), the  situation stabilized, but not for long. This year an outbreak of  cholera epidemic imported from India and Turkey was noted (a  total of 17 patients in Makhachkala, Nizhniy Novgorod, Krasnodar  and Naberezhnyye Chelny). However, medical workers are troubled  even more by the appearance of ``home-grown'' cholera, the  source of which is found in Russia's own biological environment.  Thus, this year medical workers noted three cholera foci in this  country. The first case was documented in May in Kaspiysk  (Dagestan)--a certain Sergey Makhin drank his fill of untreated  water from a canal. The result--cholera in its most acute form.  It was impossible to save the patient. His wife was infected as  well. A month later cholera vibrio was found in the body of a  4-month infant in Makhachkala. And then the most alarming  communication: On 8 August the police picked up Vladimir  Shabunov, a 40-year-old person without a permanent place of  residence, at Kursk Station in Moscow. He was in a coma. After  he underwent resuscitation El Tor Ogava cholera vibrio was  isolated from him. Twenty persons who had come in contact with  the patient were revealed. Cholera virus has already been  detected in the body of one of the orderlies. Yet another person  who had come into contact with Shabunov--a 26-year-old  driver--fled the hospital on 12 August, and the police are  actively searching for him.    The agent of cholera infection--El Tor Ogava vibrio--is  classified as a ``waterborne infection,'' and therefore it lives  and multiplies in the untreated water of open-air sources.  According to specialists 50 percent of Russia's population uses  water that potentially favors cholera infection.    Responding to questions from a KOMMERSANT-DAILY  correspondent, Mr Monisov said that the former USSR republics  through which infection penetrates to Russian territory  unhindered present the greatest danger to Russia. Thus, cholera  is raging now in Tajikistan. Over 100 patients have already been  documented, of whom 41 have died. Presence of infamous Somali  refugees in the country is also an unfavorable factor. They are  a ``risk factor'' not only in relation to cholera but also in  relation to the entire spectrum of dangerous infections. All of  this, Mr Monisov emphasized, led to the need for drafting a law  ``On Protection of Russian Federation Territory From Importation  and Spread of Especially Dangerous Infections'' and a federal  ``Migration'' program regulating migration processes.</p>

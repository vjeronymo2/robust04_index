			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: New year ambitions This time last year the dominant question for UK investors was whether equities could continue to outperform bonds. The prospect of low inflation and sluggish growth in the straitjacket of the ERM made it appear as though gilts, for once, had the more sparkling future. Since the UK's departure from the ERM in September, the debate has seemed academic. Until then equities had enjoyed a total return of under 6 per cent compared with 10 per cent for UK bonds. But the devaluation turned that on its head. According to the WM Company, equities returned 20.6 per cent in 1992 as a whole, bonds only 15.5 per cent. Since devaluation paved the way for economic recovery, equities should outperform again in 1993. There is a danger, though, in overestimating the degree. In theory the UK is now free to focus its economic policy on growth, while the gilts market is likely to be weighed down with problems of oversupply. The Treasury, however, is forecasting growth of only 1 per cent this year and even the most optimistic City forecasts do not go much above 1.5 per cent. As price pressures remain relatively muted, the UK is perhaps not quite as far removed from the low growth, low inflation environment as might have been expected after its dramatic exit from the ERM.</p>

			<p>940127 FT  27 JAN 94 / French try again for Bosnia peace France is examining ways of making the European peace plan for Bosnia more acceptable to the Moslems and thus to the US, while seeking Russian support to neutralise any hostile reaction from the Serbs, the dominant group in the war in the former Yugoslav republic. Faced with growing frustration and internal division over keeping the largest contingent of United Nations troops in Bosnia, France has increased efforts to find what an Elysee official described as 'a new cocktail of incentives and threats'. The intention is to improve aid supplies as well as bringing the warring parties back to the negotiating table in Geneva. The French initiative, led by Mr Alain Juppe, the foreign minister, who has this week talked to several of his EU partners and the Americans and Russians, appears aimed at getting the European Union to endorse modifications in the peace plan when their foreign ministries' political directors meet in Brussels next Monday. A French foreign ministry official stressed yesterday that the existing peace plan, offering Moslems 33 per cent of Bosnian territory, Croats 17 per cent and Serbs 42 per cent, was 'not untouchable'. Adapting the plan to favour the Moslems a bit more might not involve increasing their overall share of Bosnian territory, but might allow them to consolidate their holdings into a more manageable whole while ensuring them access to the Sava river in the north and the Adriatic in the south. Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, yesterday confirmed that no decision had been taken yet on the withdrawal of British troops from Bosnia and that the British government would 'not act hastily or alone.' Though Mr Hurd, who visited British troops with the United Nations Protection Force in Bosnia last week, said the outlook for peace remained bleak, he emphasised that the UK was committed to maintaining its military contribution throughout the winter and to improving its effectiveness.</p>

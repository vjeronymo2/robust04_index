			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Indians shift stance on N-weapons THE Indian government yesterday confirmed an important shift in foreign policy when it told parliament that India would soon begin bilateral talks with the US on nuclear non-proliferation in South Asia. The first round of talks are due to be held in New Delhi in May when a US delegation will explore the possibility of confidence building measures between India and Pakistan aimed at making South Asia - where both countries have a nuclear capability - a nuclear safe area. Possible measures could include mutual inspection of nuclear facilities and troop redeployments aimed at reducing border tensions. A further sign of the new warmth of ties between India and the US was the confirmation by Mr Eduardo Faleiro, minister of state for external affairs, that the US and India would for the first time conduct joint naval exercises. The exercises reflect the collapse of India's Treaty of Friendship with the Soviet Union and the US's increasing coolness towards Pakistan - formerly its closest ally in the region. The shift in policy, which emerged publicly during the talks that Mr J N Dixit, India's foreign secretary, held in Washington last week, provoked a parliamentary uproar here with the opposition charging that the government had caved in to US pressure. The US has been pursuing non-proliferation in South Asia more vigorously since the disclosure of Iraq's nuclear capability and the threat that the Islamic republics within the former Soviet Union might also gain possession of nuclear weapons. Mr Faleiro repeated to parliament that India would not sign the nuclear non-proliferation treaty - which India regards as discriminating in favour of existing nuclear powers, including China. He also put into cold storage the US proposal, backed by Pakistan, for a five nation conference on regional non-proliferation. Participants would have been included Russia and China - whom India regards now as having no role in this region. India's counter-proposal for bilateral talks with the US on non-proliferation makes a big advance from the rigidity that has governed Indian nuclear policy for over a decade.</p>

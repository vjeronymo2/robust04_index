			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Giles Hewitt] </F>   [Text] Beijing, May 11 (AFP)--GATT chief Peter Sutherland  warned China Wednesday that its bid to rejoin the world trade  body was threatened by doubts over transparency and the threat  to withdraw privileged access for Chinese exports to the U.S.  market.    "There is a whole range of areas where more transparency is  sought," Sutherland said, citing concerns among GATT members  over the uniform administration of its foreign trade regime,  especially in the area of import quotas, licences and standards.    "I believe that China would be well advised to take these  concerns seriously," said Sutherland, who held talks on the  membership issue Tuesday with Foreign Trade Minister Wu Yi and  other senior officials.    China, which was a founder member of GATT but left after the  communists came to power in 1949, has made it clear that it  attaches great political significance to being readmitted before  GATT is replaced by the World Trade Organisation (WTO) on  January 1.    While such a timeframe is possible, Sutherland told  reporters  that it would be a "difficult task."    "It depends ultimately on the willingness ... of the Chinese  side to be immediately responsive to the concerns about  transparency and other issues and for the rest of the world to  respond rapidly to the political demand made by China for early  accession."    He also pointed out that the WTO provides precise guidelines  as to the types of instruments -- such as import quotas and  tariffs -- that governments may resort to in pushing individual  economic and trade priorities.    "Transparency is the only vehicle by which multilateral  scrutiny of such instruments can be achieved. And full  transparency is the basis on which China's request for  resumption will be judged," he said.    Another serious obstacle to early re-entry is the ongoing  Sino-U.S. row over China's most-favoured-nation (MFN) status,  which Washington has threatened to withdraw in June unless  significant progress is made in China's human rights record.    If MFN is withdrawn, "it may signal difficulties vis-a-vis  the conclusion of China's entry to the WTO," Sutherland said.    Because MFN is an "important principle" within the GATT,  "the  U.S. attitude, as a major contracting party to the Chinese  integration into the world economy, will be of considerable  importance to the conclusion of the negotiations for China's  full accession into the WTO."    That attitude "will be signalled one way or another by  events  in the MFN issue," he added.    On the Chinese side, Wu Yi warned Sutherland that without  Chinese participation, the WTO would be "incomplete and lack  universality."    In a policy speech made later Wednesday to an international  symposium, Wu insisted that China had in fact made "remarkable"  progress in improving market access and engineered a  "considerable rise of transparency in its foreign trade regime."    China has complained that it has not received adequate  recognition for its trade liberalisation programme and that the  requirements laid down by some GATT members for readmission  could not be met without jeopardising the reform process.    However, while praising China's "real commitment,"  Sutherland  stressed that GATT membership could not be granted on a basis  which erodes any of the fundamental principles of the  multilateral trading system.    "Therefore there is a responsibility on the part of China to  show flexibility and to give adequate assurances" that would  address the concerns of GATT members.    In effect, the deadline for concluding the current  negotiations is much closer than December, with the GATT looking  for a protocol agreement on China's re-entry to be reached  before the next GATT Working Party on China talks scheduled for  late June.    "In order to have any realistic possibility of concluding  this negotiation in time, that protocol and agreement as to the  terms of the protocol must be a priority," Sutherland said.</p>

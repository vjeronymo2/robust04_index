			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS  </P> <P> Regarding "Where in the World Was Christopher Columbus?": I would like to bring  to your attention some historical facts. Although there have been disagreements  about where Columbus first landed, it is not true that historians are trying to  decide which island it was in order to celebrate in October, 1992.  </P> <P> The first islands that Columbus arrived at did not meet the expectations that  he had derived from Marco Polo's "Voyages" and Pierre d'Ailly's "Imago Mundi."  The admiral was in search of treasure islands, rich in gold and all kinds of  precious stones that were supposed to be found in the eastern part of Asia. Not  until he arrived in Hispaniola (originally Espanola) did he believe he was  close to his goal, mainly because he finally encountered, although in small  scale, some gold mines, and, the natives spoke of a region of the island called  Cibao. Columbus, eager to prove himself right -- especially in the eyes of the  Spanish crown -- assumed that what the "Indians" were talking about was  Cipango, an island described in the books he had consulted as one of vast  wealth and wonders.  </P> <P> Despite the fact that Columbus did not realize his expectations in Hispaniola  -- or in any other island that he explored -- it is this island (now a  territory divided between the Dominican Republic and Haiti) that became the  first cultural center of the New World. Santo Domingo, in particular, was for  more than two decades, the place where the conquistadors maintained permanent  residence while other expeditions were taking place. It was there that the  first cathedral of the Americas was built and that the remains of Columbus lie.  It is not surprising, therefore, that Santo Domingo has been chosen as the main  site for the major celebrations of the 500th anniversary of the encounter of  the Old and New Worlds.  </P> <P> B.

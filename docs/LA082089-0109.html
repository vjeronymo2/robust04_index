			<p><P> August 20, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BABY LOVE;  </P> <P> TAKE HEART BY MOLLY PEACOCK (RANDOM HOUSE: $16.95; 64 PP.; 0-394-57515-6)  </P> <P> Molly Peacock was born in Buffalo, N.Y., in 1947 and now lives in New York  City. This is her third book of poems.  </P> <P> From the start of her career as a poet she's been interested in the attempt to  speak intimately -- to speak about love in particular.  </P> <P> "A Kind of Parlance," in her first book "And Live Apart," jokingly establishes  an analogy between the calls of penguins and those of human lovers:  </P> <P>  In the rookery they find  </P> <P>  their partners by pitch.  </P> <P>  This is somewhere between you  </P> <P>  pressing against the screen yelling  </P> <P>  Mol-llleee! and the sound of it  </P> <P>  whispered in low registers.  </P> <P>  She then describes a zoo-keeper talking to a sick penguin named Rocko. This  calls into question the nature of speech itself since it's being used where, in  the usual human way, it's useless. Or where it's reduced to mere sound:  </P> <P>  Rocko came slowly under her arm  </P> <P>  at four o'clock in the winter.  </P> <P>  She smoothed his head and asked  </P> <P>  the questions, "What's  </P> <P>  the matter?"  </P> <P>  "Are you sick?" "What's  </P> <P>  the matter?"  </P> <P>  Just those questions, many times.  </P> <P>  The lover/penguin analogy is then resumed to show that speech between lovers  is a problem of an equally radical kind. Partly the problem is that human  desire can't express itself properly in words -- as she says in "Desire" (in  her second book "Raw Heaven"):  </P> <P>  It doesn't speak and it isn't  </P> <P>  schooled,  </P> <P>  like a small fetal animal with  </P> <P>  wettened fur  </P> <P>  Its proper language is touch -- both Peacock and her lover envy Rocko, both  feel "the desire . . ./ . . . to move / slowly under the arm of that woman." So  she speaks in "Petting and Being a Pet" (in "Raw Heaven") of the desire to be  fondled like a small animal, of "needing met by kneading of bone which is found  / through flesh" and continues:  </P> <P> Like eyes make sense  </P> <P>  of seeing, touch makes being  </P> <P>  make sense.  </P> <P>  Here there's the old pun, very useful to Peacock, on "sense" in its  intellectual and physical meanings. This is the crucial conflict underlying her  poems -- the difficulty of speaking about the latter in terms of the former.  </P> <P> And the breakthrough Peacock made in "Raw Heaven," and which is consolidated in  "Take Heart," was to evolve a style that constantly, if implicitly, alludes to  this expressive difficulty and makes it a part of her expressive means.  </P> <P> This is to some extent a matter of rhythm. Her lines, like Robert Creeley's,  tend to move nervously, circumspectly; her line-endings cause abrupt halts and  awkward  </P> <P> pauses.  </P> <P> Unlike Creeley, though, she doesn't believe that form is an extension of  content. At times her form and content seem deliberately at odds -- as though  the form is trying to contain something that won't be contained. There are  sonnets in "Raw Heaven" where the pressure from within is so intense that their  rhythms buckle and their rhymes distort; somewhere it is so great that they  burst and overflow into 15 or 16 lines.  </P> <P> This style is especially good at negotiating risky subjects and so is crucial  to Peacock in "Take Heart" when she's writing about her abortion and the death  of her father. (For in this latest book the central theme is not so much sexual  love, as in her earlier work, as the demands of love made between parent and  child.)  </P> <P> "The Ghost," for instance, expresses her ambivalent memories of her pregnancy:  The "ghost" of that pregnancy is a source of both comfort and alarm. Peacock  makes a strange return in this poem to her theme of the need to be held and  touched, here by this fetal ghost: "When I let it surround me, the embrace is /  more mother than baby."  </P> <P> In other words, she wants her dead baby to embrace her, as though it were her  mother. This is grotesque but it illuminates the complex of associations  connected with this theme in her work -- Freudian associations that link  infantile and adult sexuality. For example the comfort that the lovers seek in  "A Kind of Parlance" -- of being tucked, like a sick penguin, under a caring  arm -- suggests this by placing parental and sexual love together.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sylvia Plath makes a similar Freudian reference in "Daddy" when she links her  dead father and her husband.  </P> <P> Now Peacock's style is quite unlike Plath's. It's a curious mix of the cerebral  -- especially in her complex similes -- and the direct, even the raw, in her  references to biographical and physiological fact (for instance, to  masturbation and the smell of her mother's menses).  </P> <P> But there's a link in the way both poets explore an obsession with their dead  fathers  </P> <P> and the effect they've had -- and continue to have, even when dead -- on their  lives.  </P> <P> So "Take Heart" begins with poems related to the death of Peacock's father and  thereby implies that the other poems in the book should be seen in the light of  the poet's relationship with this overbearing and alcoholic parent.  </P> <P> Certainly "The Ghost," with its bizarre reference to the parental embrace of an  absence, suggests the wish to be embraced by an absent dream-parent:  </P> <P>  It's not a dead little thing without a spinal cord yet, but a spirit of the  parent we all sought to have had, of possibility.  </P> <P>  However, instead of this ideal parent, Peacock had a father who, when she was  a small child, made her loiter outside the bars that his addiction drove him  to, and who, when she was an adolescent, made her declare her love for him.  </P> <P> In "Say You Love Me," the style that Peacock has evolved for dealing with risky  subjects is used with great effectiveness. Pinned to a chair, she's cowering  under her father who, although he's "hunkered over (her)" seems to be  transformed by his need for love:  </P> <P> Rage  </P> <P>  shut me up, yet "DO YOU? " was  </P> <P>  beginning  </P> <P>  to peel, as of live layers of skin, age  </P> <P>  from age from age from him until  </P> <P>  he gazed  </P> <P>  through hysteria as a wet baby  </P> <P>  thing  </P> <P>  repeating, "Do you love me? Say  </P> <P>  you do,"  </P> <P>  in baby chokes, only loud, for they  </P> <P>  came  </P> <P>  from a man.  </P> <P>  These lines are characteristic of Peacock in their telling awkwardness -- in  the halting quality that comes from treating "DO YOU?" like a noun, and  separating "beginning" and "to peel" by a stanza break. This is appropriate  because it insists on the tangle of emotions here.  </P> <P> Obviously, this is monstrous behavior on her father's part and it's not  surprising that the poems following this one celebrate his death:  </P> <P>  The aftermath of death is a release  </P> <P>  from drunken midnight calls and  </P> <P>  the unceasing  </P> <P>  responsibility without control  </P> <P>  of the one who stunted you.  </P> <P>  But the stylistic awkwardness of "Say You Love Me" stresses that these  feelings aren't simple. And given the context of this poem in Peacock's work --  which often speaks of the need to be loved, as it were, like a baby -- her  father's becoming like a baby seems more understandable, if still unforgivable.  </P> <P> After all, Peacock's own response in "The Ghost" is similar to her father's --  she wants to reverse the roles between herself and her child.  </P> <P> Peacock is conspicuously courageous in the subjects she is willing to tackle.  That she's mostly successful in doing so in "Take Heart," as in "Raw Heaven,"  is because she's discovered a technique that meticulously follows the  labyrinthine twists and turns of these emotional tangles.  </P> <P> Richard Eder is on vacation.  </P></p>

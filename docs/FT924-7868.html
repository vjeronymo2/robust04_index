			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: Building sector supported THERE were no real shocks for a building and contracting sector already primed to expect positive moves in the Autumn Statement. The building sectors have been outperforming the wider market since the prime minister outlined the government's strategy for growth last month. Commenting on confirmation of the go-ahead for the Jubilee Line extension and the expanded road building programme, a specialist at one of the leading London broking firms said he expected the market might well be slightly disappointed at the outcome. Among the building material groups, Redland picked up 8 to 387p, Rugby 5 to 218p and RMC 13 to 515p. The Jubilee extension go-ahead gave a big boost to John Mowlem, with its big exposure to Docklands, and left the shares 6 higher at 89p. The move also lifted Costain 1 1/2 to 31p and George Wimpey 4 to 106p. Other contractors to move sharply higher included Alfred McAlpine, 15 better at 135p, and Higgs &amp; Hill, which put on 2 1/2 at 45p. Housebuilders were broadly higher, responding to the cut in interest rates. Wilson Bowden jumped 19 to 339p, additionally helped by their inclusion in the influential County-30 list of best buys. Bryant, the Midlands-based housebuilder, gained 4 at 85p after the company's pension scheme sold a block of 2.54m shares at 93p apiece. Most of the stock was quickly placed in the market at 94p. A further block of 750,000 Bryant shares was crossed at 94p. BTR hit Industrial conglomerate BTR was an early exception to a very firm market as securities house Kleinwort Benson took a harsh look at its previous profit forecasts for the group. Coincidentally, BTR's share price had achieved an all-time high on Wednesday. Kleinwort analyst Mr Andrew Hollins refused to comment on figures being quoted by rivals, but there was a strong belief that he had cut his 1992 profits estimate to Pounds 984m from Pounds 1.03bn and, more significantly, his 1993 forecast to some Pounds 1.035bn from Pounds 1.15bn. This year's figure was within the current range of estimates but next year's is below most forecasts. Kleinwort is believed to have revised its view after having seen trading figures for September. However, many felt the 1993 estimate was unnecessarily low considering the positive effect of currency movements on a group that earns 40 per cent of its profits in Australia and the US. Also, the house reached its decision without talking to the company and BTR was said to be 'unhappy' at the situation, particularly as it has been talking extensively to other analysts recently. BTR shares closed 12 1/2 down at 494 1/2 p with 4.9m traded. Shell acclaimed Shell Transport's third-quarter results found widespread acclaim and the shares raced higher in heavy trading. Replacement cost profits of Pounds 824m were well in excess of a comparable Pounds 523m and the market forecasts which ranged from Pounds 575m to Pounds 685m. At their best Shell touched 553p, before slipping to end a busy session a net 12 higher at 549p. Turnover was a hefty 9.5m shares. Many analysts said the results were boosted by various items. At County NatWest, Mr Fergus Macleod said: 'The more I looked, the less impressed I was; 30 per cent of the profits came from non-operating earnings. The shares look expensive.' Mr Nick Clayton at Smith New Court described Shell shares as 'very good value for the long-term', and pointed out that the company had reduced net debt by Pounds 750m during the quarter, leaving gearing at only 5 per cent. Mr John Toalster at Strauss Turnbull said Shell's figures 'continue to vindicate our long term recommendation to switch out of BP into Shell; they show how much stronger a company it is compared with BP.' The latter edged up 2 to 238p on 9.5m traded. Gloomy comments at a lunch with its broker prompted a sharp fall for the share price of Arjo Wiggins Appleton. The stock dropped 10 to 156p - one of the biggest percentage falls in London yesterday - as the post-prandial mood leaked into the market. Arjo executives told broker UBS Phillips &amp; Drew that when it decided to cut its dividend two months ago it had done so on an 18-month view of life not getting any easier. Also, the UBS media team, which has the stock as a 'hold' recommendation, is believed to be reconsidering its current forecast of Pounds 185m for 1992. A strong set of final figures from Burton sent the shares smartly forward, but left analysts sharply divided over the future prospects of the recovering stores group. Revised profits forecasts for next year ranged from Pounds 15m (Kleinwort Benson) to Pounds 32 1/2 m (Nomura), with bears of the stock still wary of the group's ability to deliver sustained profits growth, given its recent track record. County NatWest turned from a seller to a short-term hold of the stock, welcoming the improved sales growth and maintained dividend. However, analyst Ms Kimlan Cook said the long-term performance of the shares remained in doubt. 'Burton still has a long way to go before it achieves an acceptable return on sales,' she added. The stock, which was the most heavily traded yesterday, jumped 11 to 55p in turnover of 25m shares. Dealers said the temperature was additionally raised by a story that joint-broker Cazenove had lifted its 1993/94 profits estimate to Pounds 70m, practically double the average for the rest of the market. Cazenove refused to comment on the rumour. Leading pharmaceutical stocks performed well on the back of rises on Wall Street the previous day. Glaxo gained 8 to 816p, SmithKline Beecham rose 16 to 530p and Wellcome advanced 6 to 984p. Fisons retreated 7 to 214p, pushed back by position-taking between marketmakers. Hammerson stood out in a muted property sector as other brokers joined the recent bout of upgrading of its net asset value. The ordinary shares moved ahead 16 to 254p and the 'A' stock ended 14 stronger at 249p. In spite of satisfactory interim results, Boots retreated in busy turnover of 3.6m on a combination of profit-taking, US drug worries and hints that current trading may be getting tougher. The shares, which lost 10 yesterday to 487p, had run up ahead of the results, moving close to the top of their trading range. Boots also suffered as a perceived defensive stock, as did Great Universal Stores, which weakened 23 to 1635p. Publisher Euromoney produced profits well above the high end of expectations and the shares jumped 32 to 890p. SG Warburg believes that even at this level there is strong upside and argues that on its 1993 forecast of Pounds 14.5m the shares are a buy up to Pounds 10. BT shares appreciated 15 to 388p and the partly-paid 16 to 284p after the second-quarter figures. The rise in the shares, according to specialists, reflected the increased turnover in call volumes and a reduction in costs. Royal Insurance rose 19 to 245p after better than expected third-quarter results. A bearish note published by Panmure Gordon, the stockbroker, was said to have triggered the substantial underperformance of the banking sector against the wider market. Plastics manufacturer Plysu fell 22 to 243p after a boardroom resignation. BAA lost 9 to 749p, with Kleinwort Benson said to be negative after the publication of the most recent passenger figures. Motor distributors received a fillip from the announcement in the Autumn Statement about car tax. Lex Service advanced 18 to 244p, Jessups improved 8 to 73p and Evans Halshaw rose 10 to 189p.

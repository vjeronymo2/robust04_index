The convention contains provisions on the banning,  supervision, and monitoring of exports and transportation. An  Environment Committee hearing held behind closed doors on 2  February discussed issues relating to the export and disposal of  hazardous waste and Federal Government bills on the subject.    Bayer AG and the federal Hazardous Waste Management and  German Disposal Industry associations raised constitutional  objections to a "consumer-oriented [as published] liability fund  at federal level" proposed by the Bundesrat and other bodies. A  solidarity fund of this type would only make sense, the  Hazardous Waste Management Association claimed, if all the  economic sectors involved in export procedures were cited as  potential culprits. The best method of avoiding illegal exports  remained monitoring by the laender.    The Disposal Industry Association maintained that before  founding a "waste recovery solidarity fund," it should first be  established whether a liability incumbent in principle on the  state could be replaced by a fund financed by industry.  According to the Basel Convention and the European regulation  on transportation, "subsidiary state liability" applied to  illegal exports. Such a fund would be conceivable only in the  form of an organization under civil law that all waste  transporters could join, like the "Motor Vehicle Accident  Compensation Fund." It would have to be possible to sue illegal  traders, but the fund should not have to pay for "exports  determined at the political level." Bayer considered a fund  arrangement "unfair," because legal waste conveyers would be  accepting joint liability for illegal waste exporters, and it  would contradict the principle embodied in the European waste  directive whereby the culprit had to pay.    North Rhine-Westphalia's Environment Ministry and the  Greenpeace environmental organization, on the other hand, would  welcome a culprit-oriented liability arrangement. The  Environment Ministry spoke out in no uncertain terms against  costs being borne out of public funds in accordance with the  subsidiarity principle and in favor of risk distribution with  costs shared by the waste management sector. This, it said,  seemed reasonable, as it would enhance the waste disposal  operators' sense of responsibility. Greenpeace basically  welcomed the introduction of a fund, although a solution that  obliged each of the 16 federal laender to set up an individual  fund and laid responsibility on the land where the waste came  from as unrealistic and unfair. This would place the Hanseatic  cities, the laender with a North Sea seaboard, and the eastern  federal laender at a distinct disadvantage and overburden them.  The organization also pressed for a comprehensive export ban,  especially to developing countries.</p>

			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: Guarantees may be offered on geared funds MANAGERS of unit trusts which invest in futures and options may be able to offer guarantees to their customers following a revision of current regulations planned for early next year, the Securities and Investments Board has said. At the moment, restrictions on the offering of guarantees have meant that no geared futures and options funds - known as 'GFOFs' - have been launched since restrictions on them were lifted a year ago. Only a handful of futures and options funds without guarantees have been launched. Geared funds are riskier, making it important for their managers to offer some form of guarantee to attract investors. The SIB said it was exploring methods by which funds could offer guarantees within the existing regulations, rather than preparing a complete overhaul. In a separate move, the SIB said it hoped to put out guidance soon on how all unit trust fund managers use futures to hedge their portfolios. Unofficial guidance given earlier this year by an executive of Imro, the investment management regulator, was interpreted by trustees to mean that a fund could not buy a stock index future unless there was at least a 95 per cent 'congruance' between its portfolio and the index. Fund managers have said that this effectively made it impossible for them to buy stock index futures.</p>

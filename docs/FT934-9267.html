			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Observer: Main chance China's public relations record in its future colony may be less than perfect, but Beijing's de facto embassy in Hong Kong, the Xinhua news agency, seems to think it can sell its services commercially. For Xinhua is taking time off from flinging verbal mud at governor Chris Patten to set up a subsidiary PR agency, Fortune China. Subtlety having not exactly been its strongest suit, the agency at least forbears from selling itself on the basis of its expertise. But a spokesman claims that 'good credibility and connections (will) attract a swarm of overseas companies eager to exploit the huge mainland market'. Perhaps Patten should reveal his grasp of capitalism Hong Kong-style and follow suit. With his new-found expertise in crisis management he would definitely have services to sell, though his connections may have a more limited lifespan.</p>

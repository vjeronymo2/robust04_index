			<p><P> August 1, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DUMAS ON 8-FOOT LEAP: 'WHAT TOOK SO LONG?'  </P> <P> Charlie Dumas, the first person to high jump seven feet, had a crisp reaction  Monday to news that a Cuban had become the first to clear eight feet.  </P> <P> "What took so long?" he asked.  </P> <P> It had been 33 years and 30 days since Dumas, then a Compton College freshman,  broke the seven-foot barrier at the 1956 U.S. Olympic trials at the Coliseum.  </P> <P> "I'm really surprised it took this long," Dumas said. "After the Fosbury Flop  became so widespread in the late 1970s, and they got the world record up to 7-6  and 7-7 so fast, I thought someone would get to eight in the late 1970s."  </P> <P> Dumas, 52, and his son, Kyle, 17, were fishing for largemouth bass and catfish  at Castaic Lake Saturday afternoon, probably when Javier Sotomayor was warming  up for his event at a meet in San Juan, Puerto Rico.  </P> <P> Sotomayor, a 6-foot-4, 21-year-old, cleared eight feet on his second try,  breaking his own world record of 7-11 1/2.  </P> <P> Dumas, a driver education teacher at Jordan High School in Los Angeles, said he  was falling asleep in a chair late Saturday night in his Inglewood home when he  learned of Sotomayor's historic leap.  </P> <P> "I heard someone say 'eight feet' and that got my attention," he said.  </P> <P> "I can't imagine someone jumping that high. It's a tremendous achievement. When  I think of how long I trained, how hard I worked to get that seven-foot jump,  well, it's hard to imagine someone going a foot higher than I did.  </P> <P> "After I did it, a whole bunch of guys went over seven, so now I suppose a  bunch will jump eight, too."  </P> <P> After Dumas had cleared seven for the first time, on the night of June 29,  1956, he went on to Melbourne and jumped 6-11 1/2, winning a gold medal in the  Olympics. Ultimately, he cleared seven feet 10 times.  </P> <P> His event was subsequently revolutionized by Dick Fosbury, an Oregon State  athlete who invented the flop technique -- clearing the bar on one's back as  opposed to going over on one's stomach. Soon after Fosbury had jumped 7-4 1/4  in winning a gold medal at the 1968 Olympics, old-style leapers became rare.  </P> <P> Dumas, who is 6-2, indicated that eight feet would still be a distant goal had  Fosbury never been born.  </P> <P> "I think the world record would still be between 7-7 and 7-8 if he'd never come  along," he said.  </P> <P> "I know one thing -- I never would have mastered the flop," Dumas said. "I just  didn't have that kind of body. I would've broken my neck."  </P></p>

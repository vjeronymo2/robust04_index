			<p><P> March 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NONFICTION IN BRIEF: TO SCHOOL THROUGH THE FIELDS AN IRISH COUNTRY CHILDHOOD BY  ALICE TAYLOR (ST. MARTIN'S PRESS: $14.95; 151 PP.)  </P> <P> For anyone in need of a quick vacation, Alice Taylor's memoir of her childhood  in County Cork will do as well as an afternoon spent sitting in a field of  grass high enough to blot out the skyscrapers. A best seller in Ireland ("where  scribblers are ten a penny," the London Daily Mail reminded readers), "To  School Through the Fields" is composed of vignettes, character sketches and  poems that evoke a world of warmth, security and wonder at God's creation.  </P> <P> A special mass said at a poor neighbor's house sticks in the child's memory not  only because of its beauty but also because "in the middle of the last  blessing, the curate exclaimed, with extra vehemence, 'Christ!' " -- an escaped  hen had pecked him through the makeshift altar cloth.  </P> <P> Taylor's was a quiet corner of the world, so tucked away in the countryside  that "lorry drivers dreaded our farm, and one cranky individual once poked his  head out of his cab at my father and demanded: 'Does the Almighty God know that  people live down here?' " But Taylor's telling makes the world of her village  universal, and sets her firmly in that mysteriously potent Irish storytelling  tradition. Sonja Bolle  </P></p>

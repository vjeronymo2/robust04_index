			<p><P> March 15, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WARNER CHIEF MAY CASH OUT FOR $50 MILLION  </P> <P> The financial press is fond of saying "no money will change hands" when  companies propose a merger by exchanging shares.  </P> <P> But in the case of Time Inc. and Warner Communications, a check for the  eye-popping sum of $50 million will be issued to Warner Chairman and Chief  Executive Steven J. Ross if Warner's stock continues to trade at current levels  and the merger is completed.  </P> <P> According to documents made public Tuesday at the Securities and Exchange  Commission, the 61-year-old Warner chairman must cash out on the portion of  bonus plans that have fully vested at the time of the merger. If Warner records  a 10-day average trading price of $50, Ross will receive $50.4 million.  </P> <P> Time executives, on the other hand, won't be cashing out because their company  will be the surviving entity.  </P> <P> Some differences in corporate culture between the two giants will be preserved:  Time's top two executives continue to receive minimum guaranteed bonuses of  125% of their base salaries, while Ross' bonus is pegged to the company's  earnings.  </P> <P> In addition to his $800,000 base salary, Ross will receive 0.4% of the merged  company's pretax earnings, as opposed to his current formula of 1% of after-tax  profits. Based on the 1988 results of the two companies, Ross would earn a  bonus of $4.3 million, compared to $7.1 million under the old formula.  </P> <P> With their annual base salaries and guaranteed bonuses, Time Chairman and Chief  Executive J. Richard Munro will receive at least $1.46 million while Time  President Nicholas J. Nicholas Jr. earns $1.29 million.  </P> <P> Once the companies merge, Ross will also receive options on 1.8 million shares  of Time Warner stock.  </P> <P> In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Warner shares closed  Tuesday at $49.25, off 25 cents.  </P></p>

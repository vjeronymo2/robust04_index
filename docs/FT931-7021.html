			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Observer: Problem for the Gatt pack If a job's worth doing, it's worth doing well. The old saw may be in the mind of ousted Canadian premier Brian Mulroney whose name has rapidly joined those being canvassed as a successor to Arthur Dunkel as director-general of the fate-temptingly named General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Canada's involvement in international trade questions should have given Mulroney the background to do the Gatt job as well as any of the others mooted as candidates. He is on first-name terms with most of his fellow G7 leaders and has the added experience of knowing how to hold together a country which, like the international trading system, is in danger of disintegrating. However, he is not the only understretched international statesman looking for a big job. The names of Lord Lawson and Peter Sutherland, the Irish predecessor of Sir Leon Brittan as the European Community's competition-policy commissioner, have been mentioned, as has Mexico's President Salinas, even though he's not expected to step down until next year. The problem for all of them, however, is whether the job will be worth doing after Dunkel's half-year extension of his term in the post runs out this summer. The answer is impossible to predict while the plight of the Uruguay Round of talks on world trade liberalisation hangs in the balance - and with it the plight of a more powerful Multilateral Trade Organisation. If the talks fail, Gatt and its secretariat could be marginalised, deterring any budding global deal-maker from considering the job, which in turn could hamper the institution's ability to strong-arm world leaders to commit their nations to further trade liberalisation. No wonder the staff at Gatt's headquarters in Geneva are currently talking gloomily about vicious circles.</p>

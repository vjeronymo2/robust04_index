			<p><P> December 8, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> COUNTRY-FOLK-ROCK SINGER CARPENTER: DON'T CALL HER KAREN;  </P> <P> FRESH FROM AN ENGAGEMENT AT THE ROXY, SHE BRINGS HER INTIMATE, MELANCHOLY STYLE  TO THE BANDSTAND IN ANAHEIM ON SUNDAY NIGHT.  </P> <P> Early in her show at the Roxy on Thursday night, Mary-Chapin Carpenter told an  odd little story about being chased down a backstage hallway recently by a  confused woman inquiring "Karen? Karen?"  </P> <P> This D.C.-bred country-folk-rock singer, who is doing a free show at the  Bandstand in Anaheim on Sunday night, is more likely to be confused with  Rosanne Cash, for whom she's sometimes a ringer, than with Karen Carpenter.  </P> <P> Her "Shooting Straight in the Dark" LP isn't quite as nakedly confessional as  Cash's current "Interiors," but it's not much less vulnerable.  </P> <P> To be thirtysomething and single-something is to recognize too many intimate  details in her often melancholic, always strong writing.  </P> <P> Like Cash, again, Carpenter is destined to be remembered more for her  songwriting than her performing, which is naturally limited by the downbeat  nature of much of the material -- though, toward the set's end at the Roxy, she  put her acoustic guitar down and let the rather polite backup band carry her  through such stomps as NRBQ's sprightly rocker "If I Don't Have You" and her  own two-stepper "How Do."  </P> <P> Carpenter rarely comes off as a doormat in her pointed songs about losing in  love. At times, however, you might wish she could work up a little more bile.  In one unrecorded song, she did just that: "Opening Act" was a hilarious  diatribe directed at a country headliner, unnamed except for a two-syllable  profanity.  </P> <P> "I'm not goin' bald, so I don't wear a hat," she sang in her own defense. "I  don't wear tight jeans; I'm a little too fat."  </P> <P> Nope, this isn't Karen.  </P> <P>  Mary-Chapin Carpenter sings Sunday at 6 p.m. at the Bandstand, 1721 S.  Manchester Ave., Anaheim. Admission: free, courtesy of radio station KZLA and  the Bootbarn in Anaheim. Information: (714) 956-1410.  </P> <P> </P></p>

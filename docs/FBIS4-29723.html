			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Al-Argam's Suicidal Squads"] </F>   [Text] Thailand was caught off guard by a problem from  Malaysia just as the conflict over the demand for constitutional  redrafting was causing chaos and confrontations between  supporters and opponents and jeopardizing social peace and order  nationwide. For sure, the problem cannot be overlooked.    It might be seen as a trifling report which many people can  simply ignore. However, this issue can have an adverse impact  on the not-so-good relations between Thailand and Malaysia, and  cause the Islamic world to look at Thailand with suspicious  eyes. The whole issue began when Malaysian Foreign Minister  Abdullah Badawi revealed that the Islamic fanatic group,  Al-Argam, was using Thailand as a training ground for its  suicidal squads.    Why must the Malaysian religious group have death squads? As  everybody knows, there have always been strong conflicts in all  Islamic nations over the administration of the countries. The  fanatics call for the strict enforcement of the religious law as  prescribed in the Quran, while the others want their countries  to be ruled by a constitution and an internationally recognized  legal system.    This is the cause of the conflict in the Islamic states and  Malaysia is no exception. Formerly, the Al-Argam group was  included in the Malaysian Islamic Center under the jurisdiction  of the Prime Minister's Office, the agency in charge of  overseeing Islamic affairs. However, the Malaysian Government  has banned Al-argam's operation since 1991, probably due to its  rebellious nature. It is interesting to note that Al-argam was  established 26 years ago, with suicidal squads comprising 315  members operating in 15 countries. The organization reportedly  uses Thailand or Bangkok as training venue for its militiamen.  Its leader is [Assha Ari Muhammad].    Up to this point, the Malaysian Government has probably been  seeking cooperation from the Thai Government to put an end to  Al-argam's terrorist training activities in Thailand. We  recommend that the government pay more attention to this issue  whether Al-argam really has its training center in Thailand or  not. Malaysia is playing its internal political game beyond its  boundary. Hence, Thailand is being dragged into the issue. The  leader of Al-argam is in fact a politician.    It is obvious that cooperation between Thailand and Malaysia  is a major ingredient of peaceful coexistence on this golden  peninsular. So far in many cases cooperation between the two  countries has not been very impressive. This is a good  opportunity for the two countries to make serious efforts to  strengthen their bilateral cooperation in all fields.</p>

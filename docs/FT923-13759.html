			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Markets: The rising cost of a ripe old age - Serious Money PERHAPS Britain is not a 'nation of inheritors'. The boom in home ownership and in house prices since the Second World War had led many commentators to expect a resurgence in inherited wealth. Millions of people in their middle age would suddenly have no reason to work again because they had inherited their parents' house. But a survey by Christopher Hamnett, visiting senior research fellow at Nuffield College, Oxford suggests that the predicted rise in inherited wealth will not happen. Instead, the costs of old age will eat into life savings and force people to sell their homes before the inheritance gets near their children. The social implications of this finding go far beyond the fact that Wodehousian 'drones' will not be making a come-back - they reveal a financial problem of huge magnitude which the UK has scarcely begun to tackle. Hamnett's arguments against the 'nation of inheritors' theory are as follows: fewer people are dying each year, because they are living longer (not something which ought to be a problem), while Inland Revenue statistics show that the number of homes passing at death each year has been more or less constant over the last 20 years. Most importantly, older home owners are selling or at least transferring ownership of their houses before their death. They do this either to pay for nursing care or just to generate additional income. Let me put that another way. The longer lives we can now expect have created a financial problem. Our life savings plans, based on out-of-date assumptions of longevity, are no longer adequate. To keep heads above water in retirement, the elderly are being forced to sell their homes. Hence what Hamnett calls the 'missing billions' which the nation's disappointed heirs will not, after all, inherit. He is even able to put a rough figure on this. Between 120,000 and 190,000 people enter care homes each year. Nearly half own their own homes, and around two-thirds of these need to sell them to pay for care. Hamnett says these homes are worth at least Pounds 2.5bn. Money from these sales has helped force the housing market further downwards and has paid for health care  - the cash is not going to the nation's middle-aged masses. So much, then, for John Major's widely quoted vision of wealth 'cascading down the generations'. It was always a pretty silly vision. Research by Hamnett and others, published last year, showed that the extra inherited wealth would have gone to those who were already wealthy, deepening divisions in what was supposed to become a 'classless society'. Inhabitants of inner-city council estates, excluded from the housing chain, would have felt all the more alienated. But the problem which faces us instead is even greater. The British pensions industry seems to have enough problems in the week that the man responsible for regulating it offered to resign, and the Securities and Investments Board published a sharp criticism of its own appointed watchdog. Robert Maxwell's bulky shadow continues to wreck the public's confidence in pension provision, and in those who regulate it. The problems of security which he revealed must be addressed urgently. However, in the long run an even greater problem is lurking for those who want to save for the future. No one is sure how to pay for our longer lives. The government has already been driven to bribe people into opting out of the State Earnings-Related Pension Scheme - a sign that the state foresees difficulties paying the future bill. However, one does not need to be a socialist red in tooth and claw to see some possibility of increased state funding for residential care. Meanwhile, several private sector life and health insurers - including PPP Lifetime which commissioned Hamnett's report - have launched ambitious 'long term care' insurance policies. They are truly innovative, although many believe that they are too expensive. The potential demand is limitless - people already accept that they need a pension, so they might soon accept that they also need extra help in 'old old' age. Other companies object that it would be better just to encourage even more long-term saving. On this argument, the spiralling costs of long-term care just make saving more important. Another possibility is partnership between the public and private sectors, achieved via tinkering with the tax system. Laurentian Life is campaigning strongly for this, with the idea that pension legislation should be altered. In essence, savers would put money into a 'long-term savings' account, and the government could later allow further tax privileges if the money is used for residential care. Companies already offering long-term care insurance object. They claim as they might be expected to, that their products are attractive enough without tax relief. All these ideas require urgent consideration. This country badly needs a system which can be relied on to stop a crook robbing a pension fund. That is justifiably the short-term priority. But we should not allow it to stop us from coming to terms with the rising costs of old age. We can do without the inheritance bonanza - the people who stood to gain had not earned it anyway. But long life should be a blessing, not the burden it threatens to become.</p>

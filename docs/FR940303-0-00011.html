The suspension was requested by Gulf Dairy Association, Inc., which operates a manufacturing plant at Kentwood, Louisiana. The association states that without the suspension it will be forced to make inefficient qualifying shipments of milk merely to keep the milk of its producers qualified for pooling under the order. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 01 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  March 3, 1994 through December 31, 1995. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 01 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Nicholas Memoli, Marketing Specialist, USDA/AMS/Dairy Division, Order Formulation Branch, room 2971, South Building, P.O.

Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service has certified that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule lessens the regulatory impact of the order on certain milk handlers and tends to ensure that dairy farmers will continue to have their milk priced under the order and thereby receive the benefits that accrue from such pricing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This final rule also has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This action is not intended to have a retroactive effect. This action does not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674), provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with the law and requesting a modification of an order or to be exempted from the order. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After a hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has its principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This order of suspension is issued pursuant to the provisions of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act and of the order regulating the handling of milk in the New Orleans-Mississippi marketing area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Notice of proposed rulemaking was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on January 10, 1994 (59 FR 1307), concerning a proposed suspension of certain provisions of the order. Interested persons were afforded opportunity to file written data, views, and arguments thereon. No comments were received.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After consideration of all relevant material, including the proposal in the notice, and other available information, it is hereby found and determined that for the period commencing with publication of this document in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and extending through December 31, 1995, the following provisions of the order do not tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In &sect;1094.7(c), the words ``45 percent or more of the''.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Statement of Consideration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The order will suspend through December 1995 the 45 percent delivery requirement for a cooperative association plant that is located in the New Orleans-Mississippi marketing area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Gulf Dairy Association, Inc., which operates a manufacturing plant at Kentwood, Louisiana, that is regulated under Order 94, submitted the suspension request. The cooperative stated that because of the present 45 percent delivery requirement applicable to a cooperative association that wishes to qualify a manufacturing plant for pooling, it has had to shift some of its producers to neighboring Greater Louisiana (Order 96) pool plants to keep its Kentwood plant qualified as a pool plant under Order 94. It indicated that Order 96 requires that six days' production of a producer must be received at pool plants each month in order to qualify the milk for pooling by diversion to a nonpool plant. Accordingly, it has had to move the milk of selected producers to Order 96 pool plants six days per month. Since this milk is not actually needed by these pool plants, the cooperative has then had to back-haul the milk to its Kentwood manufacturing plant for processing. The problem is now particularly acute, according to the cooperative, because two Order 94 pool plants have notified Gulf Dairy Association that they will no longer purchase milk from them after February 1, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Gulf Dairy Association noted that the problem it is experiencing could be resolved through the proposed merger of milk orders that is now under consideration by the Department. It urged that the proposed suspension be effective pending the completion of that proceeding.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The suspension is found to be necessary for the purpose of assuring that producers' milk will not have to be moved in an uneconomic and inefficient manner to assure that producers whose milk has long been associated with the New Orleans-Mississippi marketing area will continue to benefit from pooling and pricing under the order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

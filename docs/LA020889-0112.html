			<p><P> February 8, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PREP BASKETBALL;  </P> <P> SEA VIEW LEAGUE GIRLS' ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> TUSTIN HAS TOO MUCH DEPTH FOR DEPLETED SADDLEBACK IN 52-19 VICTORY  </P> <P> Tustin High School's girls' basketball team remained tied with University for  first place in the Sea View League with a 52-19 victory Tuesday at Saddleback.  </P> <P> Tustin (15-10, 7-2) led, 6-4, after one period, then used its superior depth to  outscore the Roadrunners, 15-4, in the second period and 15-1 in the third  quarter.  </P> <P> Saddleback (13-11, 4-5) played without three starters -- leading scorer and  rebounder Melody Mayfield, Melody's sister, Angela, and Priscilla Sarmiento --  who were declared ineligible this week because of grades.  </P> <P> "Not having the three girls in the lineup really hurt us," Saddleback Coach  Rosalind Robbins said. "Melody was averaging 20 points and 12 rebounds per  game, and Angela and Priscilla brought a lot of heart to the team. We stayed  close to them in the first quarter, but their defense shut us down in the  second quarter and we just fell apart."  </P> <P> Said Rick Falk, Tustin coach: "They beat us by 32 (63-31) the last time we  played them, and I was expecting a 70-60-type game the way both our teams  played.  </P> <P> "When the kids saw that they were playing without the three starters, they let  down a little. But we started controlling the offensive boards in the second  quarter and they just couldn't come back.  </P> <P> "You have to feel sorry for Rosalind losing three starters the way she did."  </P> <P> DeeDee Anderson then scored six of her team-high 13 points in the second  quarter as Tustin outscored Saddleback, 11-2, in the last five minutes of the  period and finished the first half with a 21-8 lead.  </P> <P> Chacon, who scored six first-half points before missing the last five minutes  of the second quarter after she picked up her third foul, finished the game  with 14 points to lead Saddleback.  </P> <P> University 54, Newport Harbor 38 -- Trailing, 15-10, late in the first quarter  at Newport Harbor, University ran off an 18-0 streak that ended when Newport  Harbor scored a basket just before the half ended. Shelley Davis scored 17  points and had eight rebounds for University (18-6, 7-2). Stacey Giem scored 15  points for Newport Harbor (3-6 in league play). University is tied with Tustin  for first place in league with one regular-season game remaining.  </P></p>

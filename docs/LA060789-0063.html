			<p><P> June 7, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HIGH COURT ACTS TO SPEED ITS REVIEW OF CAPITAL CASES  </P> <P> Over objections from two justices, the state Supreme Court on Tuesday issued  new procedural rules designed to speed the review of death-penalty cases.  </P> <P> The new standards require defense attorneys to ensure that habeas corpus  petitions -- in which condemned prisoners raise new issues that go beyond  claims in their direct appeals to the court -- are filed "without substantial  delay."  </P> <P> Until now, these secondary appeals, which raise such issues as inadequate trial  counsel or newly discovered evidence, ordinarily have not been filed until  after the defendant's direct appeal has been decided by the high court. Under  the new rules, both such appeals ordinarily will have to be filed at virtually  the same time, enabling the justices to consolidate their review of the  appeals.  </P> <P> The rules, announced in a statement by Chief Justice Malcolm M. Lucas, were  issued in the wake of widespread concern among legal authorities over delay and  uncertainty in the review of capital appeals. Lucas is co-chairman of an  American Bar Assn. task force studying the problem in both state and federal  courts.  </P> <P> However, Justices Stanley Mosk and Allen E. Broussard, two liberals on a  conservative-dominated high court, dissented from the rules "on various  grounds," Tuesday's cryptically worded statement said.  </P> <P> Mosk, it said, "particularly opposed" provisions that would impose new time  standards requiring that, with some exceptions, habeas corpus petitions must be  filed within 60 days after final briefs are due in the defendant's direct  appeal.  </P> <P> Broussard "primarily objected" to applying the new standards to pending cases,  Lucas' statement said.  </P> <P> The new regulations also drew sharp criticism from Michael D. Laurence,  director of the Death Penalty Project of American Civil Liberties Union of  Northern California.  </P> <P> Laurence warned that requiring defense attorneys to investigate cases and  prepare briefs in direct appeals and habeas appeals at the same time could  jeopardize the quality of a defendant's legal representation.  </P> <P> "There is a risk that innocent people may be rushed through the system because  an appellate attorney was rushed through the system," he said.  </P> <P> Michael G. Millman, director of the California Appellate Project, a nonprofit  group that assists lawyers in capital appeals, said the new standards will be  "helpful in clarifying the expectations" of defense counsel.  </P> <P> But Millman voiced concern about the fairness of applying to pending cases new  rules that appear to represent "a significant break" from past procedures.  </P> <P> On a different front, state Deputy Atty. Gen. Dane R. Gillette expressed doubt  that the new rules would weaken the quality of habeas corpus petitions. And he  welcomed the new policy as one that would improve the speed and efficiency of  the whole capital appeal process.  </P> <P> "We're enthusiastic about the new rules," Gillette said. "By combining the  habeas proceedings with the direct appeal, we can get these cases through the  state system much more expeditiously. . . . Overall, it will benefit the  criminal justice system."  </P> <P> The new rules say that habeas corpus petitions that are not filed within 60  days of final briefs in direct appeals can be denied as "untimely." But the  court will allow exceptions to the limit when defense counsel can show that  petitions were filed within a "reasonable time" after they became aware of new  facts or legal issues about a case.  </P> <P> The rules also require court-appointed counsel to represent condemned prisoners  all the way through direct and secondary appeals in state and federal court  and, if necessary, to seek clemency from the governor for an inmate who faces  imminent execution.  </P> <P> The justices will consider replacing such attorneys "only if appropriate  replacement counsel is ready and willing" to take over the job, Lucas said in  the statement.  </P></p>

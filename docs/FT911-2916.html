			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / London Stock Exchange: Early gains reversed before the close THE UK stock market gave ground again yesterday as Wall Street continued to stall and another round of minor rights issues from UK companies eroded the cash reserves of the big investment institutions. Cash calls since the turn of the year now exceed Pounds 3bn. First-quarter trading results from ICI, the blue chip chemical group which is widely held by institutions, brought little cheer for the market, although the drop in profits was in line with the most optimistic forecasts in the City of London. Weakness in sterling dealt a fresh blow to lingering hopes for another early cut in UK base rates. Equities opened higher after Wall Street's improvement overnight and extended their gains very briefly to move to within six Footsie points of the 2,500 mark in the absence of sellers. But ICI's profits figures brought little joy across the broad range of the market and, with Sir Denys Henderson, the ICI chairman, warning that trading could remain difficult, the share market proved unable to sustain the gains chalked up at the opening of trading. With little else to look forward to, the UK market shuffled around its overnight levels until Wall Street came in on the downside. The Dow Industrial Average was sharply off in early trading and London quickly showed a net fall of 8.5 on the Footsie before steadying as the loss on the Dow was reduced to 14 points in London trading hours. At the close the FT-SE Index stood at 2,482.1 for a loss on the day of 6.5 points. Seaq volume edged higher to 463.8m shares from the 436.7m of the previous session but remained disappointingly low by the bull market standards achieved only six weeks ago. Yesterday's trading volume total included significant business in Reuters shares, where selling was led from the US stock markets after the annual meeting of the global electronics reporting group was told that revenues would be flat in the months ahead. Rights issues from a group of small companies with interests ranging from housebuilding to the manufacture of Christmas decorations totalled only Pounds 60m yesterday, but they maintained the pressures on institutional cash holdings. Fund managers have already earmarked substantial funds for the rights issues expected to fall on the equity sector over the next few months; one manager commented that his cash flow for the next two months is now committed. Rights issue calls, together with the decline in daily trading volumes and numerous placings of stock, are putting pressure on liquidity in the stock market. There were further somewhat despairing suggestions yesterday that a large takeover bid for a company on the FT-SE 100 list may shortly help market liquidity by supplying fresh cash for institutional coffers; last week's fund-raising by Hanson, regarded as the most likely bidder in the UK market, was keenly assessed. However, views on near-term prospects for the UK economy, depressed by reports from this week's conference of the Institute of Directors of UK companies, took a further blow from bearish comments from the Confederation of British Industry, the British Chambers of Commerce and the Engineering Employers Federation. Equity strategists appear to be increasingly taking the view that the second quarter of 1991 could prove unimpressive for investors, particularly when compared to the strong performance of the first three months of the year.</p>

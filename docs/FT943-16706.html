			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / Al Fresco Living: Grills and griddles - the simple and sublime / Peter Knight and Lucia van der Post have been seeking some classy additions to the outdoor table .. It has to be British - it barbecues in the rain. The new kettle-type gas barbecue from a UK company called Outdoor Chef should satisfy the growing number of northern Europeans who have developed a taste for the Mediterranean charcoal grill, writes Peter Knight. Granted, some other barbecues can also withstand the northern drizzle too, but the Outdoor Chef has, more importantly, removed the hazard of fat flare-ups that plague most of its gas competitors. When correctly done, barbecued food is deliciously simple. You do not need any special tools - a box of matches, a few dry twigs and a piece of wire mesh will do. That distinctive barbecue taste comes from the fat and juices dropping on to the hot coals, vaporising and rising to smoke the food above. This flavour will be further enhanced by the smoke coming from a fire made from wood - the French swear by grapevine - and can be increased by placing aromatic wood chips on charcoal while the food is cooking. But you do not need wood smoke to achieve the barbecue flavour. Good charcoal emits no smoke and that is why gas barbecues are just as good. The secret of getting the best flavour is to expose the food to as much of its own smoke as possible (which makes it important to oil vegetables and fatless meat while grilling). The best way to ensure a good smoking is to trap the vaporised juices around the food and that is why the better barbecues have lids. The lids also trap the heat and the food cooks from above too. Flavour, of course, is not the only factor. Some like the cinderish look and taste of flamed food and others like to get the food, especially potatoes, right on to the coals. The choice of equipment will influence the look and taste. There are two types of barbecue. One grills the food with naked heat from beneath and, if it has a lid, from above too. The other is a griddle, a slab of metal heated by gas or charcoal. Griddles are popular in Australia and South Africa and are becoming available in Europe. Aficionados prefer a grill where the juices fall on to the heat source. Grill-type barbecues come in various forms, from the Pounds 3.99 disposable tray, pre-packed with self-igniting charcoal, to charcoal and gas-driven devices with lids, which cost anything from about Pounds 50 to Pounds 1,000. Charcoal barbecues are cheaper than gas (fewer working parts) and give excellent results, especially if they have a lid that can capture the smoke. The price depends largely on the quality of construction and materials - important if you want the contraption to last in the garden. Their main drawback is the hassle of handling and lighting the charcoal and then waiting for it to reach its optimum heat output. Lighting usually involves some form of petrochemical, such as a paraffin block or a fluid. This makes an unpleasant smell, the fumes are bad for the environment - banned in certain parts of the US - and can taint the food. You can overcome the lighting problems by using a portable gas lighter or a gas blow torch. Another problem is finding good charcoal. Much of the charcoal sold in Britain is from forests in Asia and South America and is often badly made. Good charcoal will be slightly more expensive and an increasing amount is now being made in the UK from coppiced woodland, an environmentally sound practice. Look for labels or buy only from responsible outlets such as B &amp; Q, Do-it-All, Wickes and other members of the World Wildlife Fund 95 Group, who have pledged to supply wood products from environmentally sound sources. Most gas barbecues are the American 'coffin' type and look hideous. Until this year, unless you bought a top-of-the-range Weber - rather ugly when compared with the company's classic charcoal kettles - you would have risked the terror of flare-up when cooking fatty foods, such as chicken. Most gas devices imitate charcoal by using a bed of lava rock heated from underneath by gas burners. The principle is the same: the hot rocks heat the food, the juices drop down and are vaporised to return as smoke. To work effectively the lid has to be down, which concentrates the heat and confines the flavour-giving vapours. But it does not usually work like that because fatty foods - especially sausages, lamb, chicken and oily fish such as mackerel - drop so much fat that the rocks become saturated and a fire starts. This means the lid has to be lifted and the heat reduced (either by turning down the burner or raising the food to a higher level). Both these actions reduce the efficiency of the system. The Outdoor Chef gas kettle (Pounds 399 from good garden centres) overcomes this problem with a simple metal cone device. The Outdoor Chef kettle can also be used to griddle, roast, stir-fry and even bake pizza. It also looks good. The main benefit of gas, once the flare-up problem is overcome, is its ease of use - it switches on just like a cooker. This means you can cook outdoors in the winter and bring that summer taste indoors for eating. If this is your intention, make sure you use the more volatile propane rather than the common butane gas (a different regulator is needed). But gas barbecues also have drawbacks. They are expensive to buy (although they run efficiently), they work badly in wind, the lava-rock models are prone to fat fires, most look hideous and the quality of materials is low. If you want to cook outdoors a lot, invest in a high-quality gas model that does not suffer from fat fires, such as the Outdoor Chef or the Weber, even if this does set you back Pounds 399 or Pounds 799 respectively. Otherwise, stick to twigs and matches.</p>

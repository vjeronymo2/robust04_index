			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Reporter Chen Li (7115 0500): "Persistently and </F> Unremittingly Deepen the Anticorruption Campaign"]    [Text] On 29 March, at the eighth (enlarged) plenary  session of the autonomous regional discipline inspection  commission, Wang Qun, secretary of the autonomous regional party  committee, stressed: Anticorruption work should submit to and  serve the overall task of the work of the entire party. This  can be summarized as two sentences: The first one is that the  anticorruption campaign must facilitate the sustained, rapid,  and sound development of the national economy of the whole  region; and the other is that all sorts of corrupt phenomena  arousing complaints among the masses must be eliminated in a bid  to deepen reform and maintain stability.    At the eighth (enlarge) plenary session of the regional  discipline inspection commission held on 28 March, Comrade Jiang  Zemin's speech made at the third session of the Central  Discipline Inspection Commission and the guidelines of this  session were relayed and implemented, the experience gained from  opposing corruption at the preceding stage was summarized, the  situation we were facing was analyzed, and the tasks for the  anticorruption campaign in the foreseeable future were arranged.  The session held on 29 March was attended by Qian Fenyong, Bai  Enpei, Wuyunqimuge, Yu Xinglong, Yun Bulong, Zhaorigetu, Nai  Deng, Ba Shijie, and Zhang Hesong. And Bai Enpei presided over  the session.    Wang Qun said: This year is a key year to press forward the  overall reform and make breakthroughs in major fields and is an  extremely important year to effect sustained, rapid, and sound  development of the national economy. At the moment, the  situation of Inner Mongolia is good in general, like that in  other areas of China. Party committees and governments at all  levels and party leading comrades at all levels must obtain a  clear understanding of the current situation, enhance the sense  of the whole, and launch the anticorruption campaign based on  the overall situation of reform, development, and stability.    Wang Qun appraised the achievements scored in opposing  corruption at the preceding stage as: "The general situation was  good and development was sound." He said that this could be  manifested in the following three aspects: First, leaders at  various levels enhanced their understanding of the principle of  "taking a two-handed approach and being tough with both hands"  and their consciousness in opposing corruption. Second, some  substantial results were achieved in the anticorruption  campaign, initial results were achieved in the self-examination  and self-correction by leading cadres, some corrupt elements  were subjected to investigation and punishment, and the  spreading trend of some unhealthy practices and corrupt  phenomena were put under control. Third, in addition to these  initial results, the anticorruption campaign at the preceding  stage played a positive role in promoting the improvement of the  entire social mood and the sustained and sound development of  reform, opening up, and economic construction. Of course, while  affirming achievements, we should also understand that our  anticorruption work still lags behind in understanding, work,  and results. To sum up, the task on the anticorruption campaign  remains extremely arduous and thus our unremitting efforts are  needed.    Wang Qun pointed out: To continuously deepen the  anticorruption campaign through persistent efforts in line with  the region's realities, we should, what is most important, seek  unity of our ideas and enhance our understanding in the  following three issues: 1) the issue concerning the guiding  principle of "taking a two handed approach and being tough with  both hands;" 2) the issue of persisting in the anticorruption  campaign while developing the socialist market economic  structure; and 3) the issue of fully understanding the  long-duration, arduousness, and complexity of anticorruption  campaign.    Wang Qun said: Whether we can thoroughly implement the tasks  set forth by the third plenary session of the Central Discipline  Inspection Commission and whether we can launch anticorruption  campaign in a profound, sustained, and effective manner and  achieve obvious and inspiring results in the campaign depend  primarily on our endeavor of strengthening leadership and  adopting effective and practical measures to implement the  guidelines of the central authorities and the arrangements of  the regional party committee down to every grass-roots area.    For this, Wang Qun stressed: First, we should truly  strengthen the leadership over the anticorruption campaign.  Party committees and governments at all levels must grasp the  anticorruption campaign all together. Principal leading  comrades must assume personal responsibility for and personally  dispose the building of party style and the anticorruption  campaign, must personally research the conspicuous problems  concerning corruption of their own localities and departments,  must personally organize and guide the investigation and  handling of major cases, and must personally coordinate the work  in various fields in an effort to unfailingly grasp the  anticorruption work of their own localities and departments.  Second, we should define duties and pay attention to  implementation. In line with the principle that whoever takes  charge of the work should assume responsibility, we should  establish the responsibility system for building party style and  improving administrative honesty. In this aspect, work should  be divided up clearly, each unit should perform its work well,  and each level should grasp, bring along, and assume  responsibility for the work of the next lower level. When a  locality or department fails in building party style,  strengthening administrative honesty, and opposing corruption,  its top party and government leaders should assume major  responsibility for the failure. And, when a department at the  next lower level fails in building party style, strengthening  administrative honesty, and opposing corruption, leaders of the  department of the next higher level should assume  responsibility. Third, we should closely rely on the masses and  encourage and mobilize the masses to provide clues for crimes  according to facts, and the legitimate rights and interests of  the persons who provide the clues should be safeguarded.  Fourth, we should strictly enforce discipline. We must handle  law violation cases in strict accordance with laws. The cases  whose verdicts should be withdrawn, the cases which should be  sentenced to imprisonment, and the cases which should be given  severe penalty should be do so based on facts according to laws.  Fifth, we should give prominence to focal points and have a  good command of key points. This year, the general pattern of  the anticorruption work will remain unchanged. But, all  localities and departments should strive to promote the sound  development of the entire anticorruption campaign in line with  their respective realities, with the problems strongly  complained by the masses as the points to make breakthroughs.  Sixth, we should give full play to the functional role of  discipline inspection and supervisory organs, people's courts,  and people's procuratorates. In the anticorruption campaign of  this year, party committees and governments at all levels should  pay attention to strengthening leadership over and support to  these organs and bringing their role into full play.    Wang Qun said in conclusion: Launching the anticorruption  campaign is an extremely important and urgent political task set  forth by the CPC Central Committee to the whole party and is a  major event that has a bearing on the future and destiny of the  party and the country. Party committees and governments at all  levels, leading cadres holding important posts at all levels in  particular, should enhance their sense of concern, truly bear  their political duties, and persistently and unremittingly  deepen the anticorruption campaign in order to make new  contributions to ensuring and promoting reform, opening up,  economic construction, and social and political unity and  stability.    Attending the session held on 29 March were Han Wengui, Yao  Xiang, and Feng Zhilai, deputy secretaries of the regional  discipline inspection commission. Also attending were standing  committee members and members of the regional discipline  inspection commission, 24 persons in all. The Central  Discipline Inspection Commission also sent persons to attend the  session for giving guidance. Attending the session as observers  were leading comrades of various league and city party  committees who are in charge of discipline inspection work;  secretaries of discipline inspection commissions under various  league and city party committees; directors of supervisory  bureaus (sections) of various leagues, cities, and forestry  administration; responsible comrades of the discipline  inspection groups (commissions) dispatched by the regional  discipline inspection commission to the organs directly under  the regional authorities; and responsible comrades of  departments concerned.</p>

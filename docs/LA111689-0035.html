			<p><P> November 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNCIL SCRAPS PARK PLANS AFTER NEIGHBORS PROTEST  </P> <P> The Glendale City Council voted Tuesday against constructing a public park in  an affluent neighborhood at the northern edge of Rimcrest Drive, after 72% of  the nearby residents signaled their opposition in a city survey.  </P> <P> The property, which offers a breathtaking view of the city, was deeded to the  city by the construction company that developed the Rimcrest Drive subdivision  on the condition that a park be developed there.  </P> <P> Since, even though the land is not an official park, area residents have  repeatedly complained about wild parties, indiscreet sex, night prowlers and  vandals on the property.  </P> <P> After hearing the results of the survey, the council agreed to auction off the  property for development of homes.  </P> <P> "The residents, I think foolishly, decided against having a park, so we have to  go with that," said Councilwoman Ginger Bremberg.  </P></p>

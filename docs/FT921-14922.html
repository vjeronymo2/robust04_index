			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / World Trade News: Japan fears drift towards managed trade - Tokyo feels distinctly uncomfortable with the Bush accords JAPAN'S Ministry of International Trade and Industry is worried the economic accords reached with the US during President George Bush's visit could accelerate a drift towards managed trade. The agreements - which set targets for Japanese companies' purchases of US-made motor parts - have left Miti officials feeling distinctly uncomfortable. They fear the accords could set a precedent for other industries and other regions, notably the EC, which like the US has a large trade deficit with Japan. Other officials say the agreements were essential to maintain relations with the US - Japan had little choice given the priority Mr Bush put on the motor industry. But even the agreement's supporters do not hide their distaste. As Mr Noboru Hatakeyama, the Miti vice-minister for international affairs, puts it: 'We are in a dilemma. It would be good for this kind of thing not to exist. But since we are experiencing a lot of trade imbalances with the rest of the world, we think it would be good for the Japanese government to try everything it can within the limits of the government's reach.' The accords announced last week highlight the extent to which Miti has developed a new role for itself in the Japanese and world economy. In the 1950s and 1960s, its main policy was to foster growth through the expansion of exports. By the 1980s, Japanese companies were so successful that Miti began to put more emphasis on export restraint than on export promotion. But this was not enough to satisfy Japan's trading partners. So in the last few years, an increasingly high priority has been put on import promotion. The government's budget for import-promotion has grown five-fold since 1989 to a planned Y10.1bn (Pounds 44.1m) for the year starting in April. In some countries, including the US, the Japan External Trade Organisation (Jetro), which was established for promoting exports, is more active helping foreign companies sell goods in Japan. These measures are all forms of government intervention in trade. But Miti has been wary of going one big step further and trying to set import targets. In a sense, the motor parts agreement signed last week has a precedent in the US-Japan Semiconductor Agreement, which was first signed in 1986. In response to great pressure from the US, Japan agreed to measures to regulate trade in semiconductors, including a pledge to help American chip-makers increase sales in the Japanese market. The accord contained a controversial 'side-letter' in which Japan acknowledged US companies hopes' that foreign makers would attain a 20 per cent share of the Japanese semiconductor market. The wording was left deliberately vague at Miti's insistence, since Japanese officials did not want to be bound to a target. But US companies insisted that, whatever the verbal niceties, Japan had made a commitment. Following much acrimony, the agreement was renewed last year, with the reference to the 20 per cent market share for foreign companies being incorporated into the main body of the accord. There is still plenty of scope for further arguments since US companies believe the deadline for the 20 per cent target to be reached is the end of 1992 and foreign makers' currently have around 15 per cent of the Japanese market. Some Miti officials fear the motor parts agreement is even more likely to cause disputes than the semiconductor accord. Under the accord, Japanese companies have promised to increase their purchases of US-made parts from Dollars 9bn in the 1990 fiscal year to Dollars 19bn in the 1994 fiscal year. This includes both imports and purchases by Japanese companies for their factories in the US. Among the potential causes for dispute is a vague reference to the fact that US parts makers should 'make their best efforts' to work with Japanese companies. Another is a loosely-worded Japanese promise to give 'special consideration' to the US parts industry. This means Japanese car makers are expected to favour US-owned component makers over the American subsidiaries of Japanese parts companies. Moreover, the fact that pledges made by private companies are incorporated into a government-to-government agreement could in itself spark future arguments. It should be said that both US and Japanese officials drafted the agreement under difficult conditions: Mr Bush was under pressure to achieve concrete 'results'. Miti for its part had to deal with companies which were reluctant to put their names to numerical targets. Both sides also had to steer clear of infringing their Gatt obligations. Nevertheless, Miti officials acknowledge the accord comes at a delicate time when Gatt members are trying to reach final agreement in the Uruguay Round. One Miti official says the motor parts accord was designed to meet short-term political objectives, at the expense of medium- and long-term goals. The danger is that it may not even do that, given the hostile reception that greeted Mr Bush on his return to the US.</p>

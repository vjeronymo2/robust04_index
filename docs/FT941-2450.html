			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / Business Travel: Ringing the charges - Telephoning from hotels around the world can cost you dear Our recent invitation to readers to send in tales of mammoth hotel telephone charges yielded a barrage of festering grievances. The main complaint concerned the premium levied by hotels, both for direct-dialled calls from bedrooms and for the use of telephone calling cards, a prime purpose of which is to avoid extortionate hotel phone charges in the first place. One reader, staying at the Royal Moat House Hotel in Nottingham last month, was charged Pounds 82 for a 22-minute off-peak call back home to Singapore. The standard BT tariff for the call is about Pounds 17 - representing a nearly fivefold mark-up. His complaint was not just at the size of the bill, but at the hotel's failure to make clear the scale of the mark-up. The list of 'hotel services' in the bedroom states simply that 'calls are charged at 30p per unit for 5 units and 25p for subsequent units' - which, as he writes, 'provides absolutely no information to overseas guests who are unaware of the relationship between units and minutes'. A reader staying at the Bellhouse Hotel in Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, was well aware of that relationship, and used his BT calling card to avoid it. He was caught nonetheless by a 'facility charge' for the use of such calling cards cards of 20p a minute. Both hotels confirm the charge rates. One-off 'access charges' are common - 75 cents being the norm in the US - but facilities charges are in a different league. 'What next?' asks the reader who stayed at the Bellhouse. 'Charges for incoming calls - after all, they have to be answered by the hotel operator?' A visitor to Taipei was faced with a four-day hotel bill of Pounds 1,050 including Pounds 600 in phone calls - 'I made some long calls to the UK and Tokyo, but was not prepared for that amount.' However, his main complaint was against the leading phone company whose card he was using: its inaccurate billing system produced a grossly inflated bill. So it pays to check your bills. It also pays to complain. The Bellhouse visitor got a refund; so did another reader, who faced a Dollars 100 phone bill at a central Washington DC hotel, made up of 100 charges of Dollars 1 for each call made using a calling card. He had his bill halved, and is pressing for a discount on the access charge for travellers making an above-average number of hotel calls. Some readers think the age-long custom of asking people to call you back is the only remedy. This also avoids calling-card premiums, although card charges are far lower than direct-dial rates levied by most hotels. But if you are using a calling card from a public phone, be careful not to be seen tapping in your personal identification number (PIN). One reader had his AT&amp;T code 'stolen' at Heathrow and was sent an Dollars 18,000 bill - 'presumably for drug calls all over the world'. It is notable that virtually all responses came from self- employed consultants or em-ployees of small companies. Are they the only travelling executives who look at their hotel bills before paying?</p>

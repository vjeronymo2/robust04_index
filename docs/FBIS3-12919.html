			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Gaza -- Dr. Zakariya al-Agha, the Fatah official  responsible for the Gaza Strip, has said that the release of a  few hundred prisoners is insufficient and is a cosmetic move  aimed only at deflecting the Palestinian people's anger and the  international condemnation of the Hebron massacre.    Al-Agha added that if the Israeli Government wants to  implement more positive measures, it should release all the  Palestinian prisoners, without exception or discrimination. It  should also reassess the settlement policy, disband the  settlements in the occupied territories, and disarm the settlers.    Commenting on the Israeli Government's decisions in the wake  of the massacre, al-Agha said: The Israeli Government's  decisions are deficient. I do not believe that they will be  effective in putting an end to the danger posed by the settlers  and to their conduct and aggressions. He noted that the Israeli  Government must address the issue of the settlements and  settlers in a fundamental rather than a superficial way.    Regarding Fatah's position and intention to resume armed  activities in response to the massacre, Dr. al-Agha said: I  believe there was never a decision to stop armed activities.  There was only a "truce" which the two sides were obliged to  observe and respect. We now see that the Israeli side failed to  abide by the truce and violated it several times. It is  inconceivable for us to stand idly by in the face of these  violations and remain committed to the truce.    Dr. al-Agha expressed the belief that conditions must be set  for the resumption of the talks -- the most important being the  disarming of all the settlers. Israel must also agree to  disband the settlements and evacuate them from all the occupied  territories. International protection should be provided for the  Palestinian people until these two conditions are met.    Dr. al-Agha noted that the current situation necessitates  the  drafting of new formulas for the talks. He said that the  Palestinian people support the suspension of the talks until the  situation is reassessed and new conditions are set. These  conditions must be accepted by Israel, because the negotiating  climate and the circumstances that prevailed prior to the  massacre have now changed. New realities have imposed  themselves on the scene and should be addressed. Among these  are the settlement issue, the Palestinian people's safety, and  the settlers' aggressions. Therefore, these issues must be  given top priority before the resumption of the talks is  considered.    The Palestinian official stressed that international  protection is not a substitute for removing the settlements; it  is a temporary measure until all the settlements are removed.    Commenting on the positions taken by the United States and  Western countries regarding the massacre, the Palestinian  official expressed the belief that these positions were good but  not enough. He noted that while they condemned this criminal  act, condemnation alone is not enough and words must be  translated into deeds. the way to do this is to support the  Palestinian people's demands, which are their natural right.    Dr. al-Agha called on Palestinian national and Islamic  forces  to coordinate and close ranks. He said that this stage is  crucial and critical for every Palestinian and that it is the  duty of all Palestinian national and Islamic forces to engage in  dialogue and seek the lowest common denominator for national  unity.</p>

			<p><P> May 25, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A TRUE-BLUE BRUIN;  </P> <P> SPRINTER MIKE MARSH, NURSING SORE HAMSTRING, SHOWS HIS COMPETITIVE SPIRIT TO  KEEP UCLA UNDEFEATED STREAK INTACT  </P> <P> The best way to sum up Mike Marsh's senior year at UCLA was the series of  events that took place April 15 at Drake Stadium during the meet against  Houston and Louisiana State.  </P> <P> All season, Marsh has had to balance his commitments to the Bruin team with his  career as a world-class sprinter who competed in the Seoul Olympics.  </P> <P> Marsh, a graduate of Hawthorne High, and teammate Steve Lewis, the Olympic gold  medal winner in the 400 meters, had entered the Drake Stadium meet nursing sore  hamstrings and were not expected to run.  </P> <P> In past years, the Bruins would still have been in good shape, but their  sprinting corps has been depleted this year with the loss of Danny Everett, the  Olympic bronze medal winner in the 400 meters who turned professional, and  Henry Thomas, another Hawthorne graduate who decided to redshirt this season.  </P> <P> So with Marsh and Lewis watching from the sidelines, the early lead that UCLA  built against LSU in the field events gradually dwindled, leaving the Bruins'  four-year dual meet winning streak in jeopardy.  </P> <P> "Steve and I talked about it and we decided that if it came down to the mile  relay, we'd run," Marsh said.  </P> <P> Going into the last event, the mile relay, UCLA trailed LSU, 77-72, and Marsh  and Lewis decided to give it that old college try and run.  </P> <P> First, however, they had to convince their sprint coach, John Smith.  </P> <P> "John said no at first," Marsh said. "Steve did all the talking. We sat him  down and told him we wanted to do this. This is our track team, our home and we  wanted to keep the streak alive. This was a decision that we made. He said OK."  </P> <P> So Marsh ran a 45.6 second leg and Lewis a 46.4 anchor leg as the Bruins won  the event and tied the meet at 77-77 to extend the unbeaten streak to 42 (it  has since been extended to 43).  </P> <P> "I'd gone into the meet thinking I'm not going to run," Marsh said. "And I sat  around for a while. But them emotions get to flying and all of the sudden it's  like, 'Well, (the hamstring is) not that bad.' "  </P> <P> Since then, Marsh's hamstring problems have continued to plague him and he has  been used sparingly, with his last race on April 28 against USC. Marsh and  Smith said that by running to keep the streak alive, Marsh might have  reaggravated the injury, putting his other goals -- such as running on the  professional circuit in Europe this summer -- in jeopardy.  </P> <P> "We saved the unbeaten streak, but I did irritate my hamstring a little bit.  That might have something to do with the problems I'm having now," Marsh said.  "But I make no excuses. That's the decision I made. I'm not bitter about it."  </P> <P> Said Smith: "If I had to do it again, I wouldn't let them run. But I have a lot  of respect for what they did. That's why they're here. . . . It was something  they felt they needed to do."  </P> <P> Besides the LSU dramatics, Marsh's only other notable success during this  injury-plagued year has been a school-record 10.07 in the 100 meters in the  Gainesville relays when he took second to Olympic teammate Dennis Mitchell of  Florida.  </P> <P> Last weekend at the Pacific 10 Conference finals, Marsh decided against running  in the 100 or 200 meters (he would have run in the finals of the 400-meter  relay if the team hadn't been disqualified in a preliminary race) but took  second behind Lewis in the 400 meters. In qualifying for the 400, Marsh had a  lifetime best of 46.21. Marsh also ran the second leg of the winning  1,600-meter relay and the Bruins will try to qualify for nationals in both  relays this weekend.  </P> <P> "We didn't want Mike to come blasting out of the starts in the 100 or 200 where  he could reinjure himself," said UCLA Coach Bob Larsen, who guided the Bruin  men to their third consecutive conference title.  </P> <P> Marsh placed sixth in the 100 meters at the U.S. national trials in  Indianapolis, earning a spot on the 400-meter relay team. The U.S. team,  however, was disqualified for an illegal baton exchange in the first qualifying  round, leaving Marsh a spectator for the remainder of the Games.  </P> <P> "I was disappointed that the team got disqualified, but things like that  happen," Marsh said. "The thing with Seoul was the whole international scene.  You saw a spirit of competition that was tremendous. Everybody came out on top.  You're already a success being there."  </P> <P> Marsh is setting his sights on the national championships May 31-June 3 in  Provo, Utah. Last year Marsh finished fourth in the 100 meters and ran on the  400-meter relay team that took second. As a sophomore, he finished third in the  100 meters and fourth in the 200 meters. He still hopes to race in Europe this  summer, then plans to return to UCLA to get his degree in history with a  business emphasis and possibly attend graduate school. He also has his eye on  the 1992 Olympics, which will be held in Barcelona, Spain.  </P> <P> "Seoul's given me a bigger perspective on the things I want to do in track and  field," he said. "I want to go into Barcelona and be one of the best. That's  what I'm setting up to train for."  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 26, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HART RECORDS OVERTIME WIN AGAINST BUENA TO REACH FINAL  </P> <P> The Buena High girls' basketball team was hoping it had seen the last of Hart's  Sara Wilson, who sat out the entire third quarter in foul trouble.  </P> <P> Unfortunately for the Bulldogs, the junior forward returned midway in the  fourth quarter, a timely reappearance for the Indians, who beat the Bulldogs,  78-68 in overtime, in a Southern Section 5-A Division semifinal at Ventura  College on Saturday.  </P> <P> Hart will play Santa Barbara, a 44-41 winner over Ontario, in the championship  game Friday night at Cal Poly Pomona.  </P> <P> Nikki Brodowy and Wilson each made baskets in the last minute of regulation to  tie the score, 66-66. Buena had possession with 21 seconds left but was unable  to score.  </P> <P> Wilson made the first basket in overtime, then missed two free throws before  fouling out.  </P> <P> "She is one of the keys to this team," Hart Coach Pam Walker said. "Her  leadership on the floor down the stretch really calmed us down."  </P> <P> Despite her prolonged absence, Wilson, who finished with 13 points, said that  she never doubted her teammates would fill in for her.  </P> <P> "I knew they would be able to come through with me out, so I wasn't worried,"  Wilson said.  </P> <P> Buena (22-4), ranked third in the Southern Section, gave Walker some uneasy  moments, however.  </P> <P> Trailing, 54-49, after three quarters, the Bulldogs rallied to tie with 5:58  left, then took a four-point lead on Marci Ewin's basket with 2:33 to play.  </P> <P> But the No. 2-seeded Indians (24-2), who have won 14 consecutive games,  outscored Buena, 6-2, in the last two minutes and forced the overtime on  Wilson's dramatic basket with 25 seconds left.  </P> <P> Joannie Weinerth's basket with 1:13 left in overtime accounted for Buena's only  scoring in the three-minute period.  </P> <P> "We did this as a team and everyone contributed," Walker said. "I am just  really proud of the way they played.  </P> <P> "Buena has been here so many times and this is virgin territory for us."  </P> <P> Buena led, 16-12, after the first quarter. The Indians caught up, 27-27, with  2:27 left in the first half on Wilson's three-point play.  </P> <P> Anjanette Dionne scored a game-high 20 points to lead Hart, which made 13 of 20  free throws. Kim Posey added 17 points and Brodowy had 10. Weinerth led Buena  with 16 points and Jennifer Goodwin added 12.  </P></p>

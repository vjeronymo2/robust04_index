			<p><P> August 31, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARUM TRYING TO MATCH FOREMAN AND COONEY  </P> <P> Boxing promoter Bob Arum said Wednesday he is trying to bring together George  Foreman, 41, and Gerry Cooney, 33, in a heavyweight fight at Atlantic City,  N.J., in January or February.  </P> <P> "George has agreed to everything we've proposed," Arum said. "Cooney says he  wants to do it, but he hasn't signed anything."  </P> <P> Foreman, Arum said, wants to enhance his bargaining strength with Arum's rival  promoter, Don King, when Foreman negotiates for a championship fight against  Mike Tyson.  </P> <P> "If George were to beat Cooney, he'd be coming off a heavily promoted event and  he'd be in the spotlight," Arum said. "It would take him from a $5-million  payday against Tyson to maybe $10 million."  </P> <P> Arum said Foreman and Cooney would both earn seven-digit paydays in the  proposed bout, which will be shown on pay-per-view television.  </P> <P> Foreman, heavyweight champion in 1973 and 1974, has been waging a comeback  since 1987. He's 18-0 on the comeback, but all his bouts have been against  little known heavyweights.  </P> <P> Foreman was 45-2 when he retired in 1977. He won the championship in 1973 on  his 25th birthday by knocking out Joe Frazier. He lost it 22 months later when  he was knocked out by Muhammad Ali.  </P> <P> When he began training for the comeback in late 1986, his weight was in the  320-pound range. Lately, he has fought in the 250s.  </P> <P> Cooney hasn't fought since June, 1987, when he was knocked out by Michael  Spinks. Before that, he had been in virtual retirement after his loss to Larry  Holmes in 1982. Since Holmes, Cooney has fought four times.  </P> <P> Cooney's longtime trainer, Victor Valle, confirmed Cooney-Foreman negotiations.  </P> <P> "Arum made us a good offer, and Gerry and I are still discussing it," he said.  </P> <P> "Gerry is in training now, privately. The date they're talking about is Jan.  15, at Caesars Atlantic City."  </P></p>

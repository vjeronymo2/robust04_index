			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Roni Shaqed] </F>   [Text] "Salaam 1 to Salaam 2, how are you doing, over and  out."    "This is Salaam 2. All is well. What do you want?"    "Salaam 2, overtake me, we are entering a road under Israeli  jurisdiction. According to regulations, you are supposed to  lead the joint patrol on this road."    "Salaam 1, thank you. Am overtaking, follow me. Over and  out."    This conversation in Arabic was held over the "peace"  network  in northern Jericho Tuesday [17 May] morning.    Salaam 2 -- an Israeli Border Police patrol jeep, and Salaam  2 -- a patrol jeep of the PLO's al-Aqsa Brigade -- jointly  patrolled road No. 90 from Jericho to al-'Awja'. The  conversation was received in the joint PLO-Israeli operations  room located on a military base in the Vered Yeriho junction,  and was duly logged by the Palestinian duty officer. The same  conversation was received in the al-Aqsa Brigade operations room  in Jericho and the Border Police company's operations room in  the Vered Yeriho junction.    The Salaam 2 jeep was commanded by a Border Police  subinspector. Three policemen occupied the back seat -- two from  the Border Police and one from Israel Police. They were  carrying M-16's and wearing bulletproof vests. An orange flag  -- the joint patrol's emblem -- was flying on the jeep's roof.    The Salaam 1 jeep -- a khaki-colored Palestinian Toyota --  was occupied by five solders and a lieutenant. Their appearance  was much less uniform. The driver wore light khakis, the  officer and three soldiers -- olive drabs. Each had different  shoes on. As for the fifth soldier, he wore camouflage and a  red beret. They were all cradling Kalashnikov rifles in their  arms. Just like the Israeli jeep roof, theirs had an orange  flag, but also a large Palestinian flag.    This week Jericho looked as if the messiah had already come.  Yesterday's enemies were now pals. A peaceful honeymoon seemed  to have followed the cross, grating wedding in Cairo three weeks  earlier. 'Arafat and Rabin are cross, but in Jericho,  Palestinian and Israeli soldiers -- perhaps still in shock at  the first encounter -- managed to cooperate this week. And  quite well, too.    Inspector Salah Khatib, a Galilee Druze Border Police  officer, is the Israeli commander of the joint operations room.  "I never dreamed of such a situation. The same man, who could  have been at the other end of my gun a few days ago, is now  sitting next to me. We shake hands. We have coffee together.  We work in full cooperation. I am really enjoying every  moment. Although it has not been long, there is a feeling of  real friendship. We feel as if we have been working together  for a long time."    Lieutenant Jum'a Marwan from the al-Aqsa Brigade is sitting  next to him. He, too, is beaming: "Thank God, we are sitting  together after 40 years of enmity. It is a dream. Sitting  together in the same room with an Israeli officer, working on a  joint security task -- it's a dream. We spend many hours  together. We eat together. We talk. We cooperate like  brothers. I hope all the agreements signed by Brother  Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] will materialize."    So far, thank God, there have been no serious events to put  the cooperation to a test. This idyll (or nightmare for  pessimists) may evolve into a crisis soon enough. There are  enough friction points both in Jericho and Gaza. A stone thrown  at a Na'ama settler's car, hitting a child, or gunfire at a  Qatif Bloc settler's car are an example of real-life events.  Not to mention the formidable land mine created by the Shalom  'Al Yisra'el synagogue. By the way, the fuse of this Jericho  bomb may have been ignited this week.    The settlers came to the site carrying weapons. The  Palestinians fumed. "They cannot bring weapons to prayer in a  synagogue," Jericho military commander, Isma'il al-Hajj,  grumbled. Faysal al-Husayni warned that the Hebron event is  liable to recur in the Jericho synagogue. Under the agreement,  an Israeli may carry licensed weapons when entering autonomy  territory. "The agreement does not state that armed settlers  may enter a synagogue," al- Husayni told the U.S. secretary of  state, asking for his intervention.    But the settlers remained adamant. To their dismay, the  agreement limited their presence at the synagogue to the time  between 0900 and 1800, in a group not exceeding 30 worshipers.  This week they demonstratively ignored the Palestinian  soldiers. "We will not obey their orders," they declared.    The security cooperation was the result of the need to imbue  complicated agreement clauses with content. The security  responsibility distribution between Israel -- which is in charge  of foreign security, settlement security, and the security of  Israelis -- and the Palestinian authority -- which is in charge  of internal security and public order enforcement in autonomy  territory -- requires close cooperation between field soldiers.    To enable that, the sides established the JSC [preceding  abbreviation in English], the Joint Coordination and Cooperation  Committee, in which officers exchange information and guide the  three DCO's [preceding abbreviation in English], the District  Coordination and Cooperation Offices, which have been set up in  Gaza, Khan Yunus, and Jericho.    The three coordination offices operate 24 hours a day as  joint commands. The offices guide the joint patrols and the  joint stationary patrols.    Patrols are carried out 24 hours every day along autonomy  roads used by Israelis and the length of the shore opposite the  Qatif Bloc. The joint patrol includes an Israeli jeep and a  Palestinian jeep. The patrol is led by an Israeli vehicle on  roads under Israeli jurisdiction and by a Palestinian one on  roads for which Palestinians are responsible.    In addition, six joint mobile units have been deployed in  the  Nisanit junction, Netzarim junction, Kfar Darom junction,  Sufa-Morag junction, Vered Yeriho junction, and in the vicinity  of the Elisha' Nahal Brigade presettlement in northern Jericho.  These units are the alert force.    The operations room of the Jericho regional coordination  office at the military base near the Vered Yeriho checkpoint was  inaugurated last Friday. "Authorized Personnel Only," its door  says.    The trailer is partitioned into three sections: the Israeli  command room, the Palestinian command room, and the joint  operations room between these two. Two officers -- an Israeli  and a Palestinian -- sit behind a large desk. The table  accommodates a telephone, a radio, logs, and maps. The wall  features a large 1:200,000 map of the autonomous areas. The map  is in Hebrew and Arabic. The main traffic axes are prominently  marked in purple. Another wall features a chart of the joint  radio network in Hebrew and Arabic. "Salaam" (peace) is this  extensive network's code name. All the checkpoints around  Jericho, the Allenby Bridge, the joint patrols, and the troop  commanders are linked up to it.    A list of duty officers and aides hangs on another wall. On  the day we visited, the lists said: On the Israeli side, patrol  commander is Lt. Amir, on the Palestinian side -- Lt. Hisham.  Stationary force in Elisha': Israeli Lt. Bini and Palestinian  Lt. Ashraf; in Vered Yeriho, Palestinian Lt. Anis and Israeli  Lt. Dash.    Lt. Hani 'Iyad is sitting in the Palestinian operations  room.  He says his family are refugees from Zefat. He is quick with a  smile, plump and bespectacled. The East Jerusalem daily AL-QUDS  lies on his desk. Two soldiers sit on a bench in the corner  next to him. They hold Kalashnikov rifles. "I have served in  the Palestinian army since my youth many years ago," he says,  then turns away to listen to a report on the radio network.    "Where are you from?" he asks. "From YEDI'OT AHARONOT," we  reply, and he laughs. "I am familiar with it, you know. I read  your newspaper. Even in Iraq, we used to get translations of  your newspaper."    [Shaqed] How is the joint work with the Israelis going?    ['Iyad] Very well, thank God. There is no wall between us.  We eat together, drink together, sit together. How are the  Israelis? Ordinary people. They received us as a matter of  course. Our coordination is built on understanding. We have not  trained together yet, we are merely starting our cooperation.  Regarding joint training and exercises, you should ask the  command. I do not have the authority to answer that.    [Shaqed] What are your open-fire orders?    ['Iyad] The matter is clear to us. Any problem that arises  should be solved quietly and amicably. Like brothers. In the  Israeli areas, the solution of problems is up to the Israeli  jeep, while in the Palestinian areas it is up to our jeep. God  willing, there will be no problems. We have received orders to  solve problems quietly and amicably. [end 'Iyad]    The Palestinian soldiers working in the regional  coordination  office are still accorded the "full board" treatment, which  includes meals in the Israeli mess hall. The Palestinians have  somewhat of a problem in this respect. They have a dining room  in the administration building. Cooks, too. But they have no  food. Funds pledged to the policing force have not arrived yet.  In the meantime, Jericho residents are the suppliers of food  and meals. A 16-member committee representing various major  local families was established in the city to collect donations  for the al-Aqsa Brigade. During the first week, they received  free gasoline from a local gas station owner.    Colonel 'Ofer is the Israeli commander of the Jericho  regional coordination unit. The Palestinian side is represented  by Brig. Gen. Sa'di Naji, deputy commander of the al-Aqsa  Brigade. A civilian-clad Brig. Gen. Naji secretly arrived in  Jericho a week prior to the evacuation. He spent the nights at  the home of 'Abd- al-Karim Sidar, the Fatah chief in Jericho,  who briefed him about the city and its problems. He spent the  days with Col. 'Ofer and other senior officers. He studied the  roads, the various problems of the Jericho area, coordinated  various necessary issues, and prepared the patrol troops  induction. The preliminary preparations helped the joint force  to perform efficiently from its first hours.    Col. 'Ofer: "There is a lot of goodwill on both sides, great  willingness to listen, hash things out -- a definitely positive  spirit. No social ties, though. We are two different sides,  and we are here to do a job. No joint training is scheduled and  none has been done so far."    Brig. Gen. Sa'di Naji is wearing a red beret and commando  shoes. There are no decorations or emblems on his uniform, just  a small metal Palestinian flag on his chest. He has a small  two-way radio and a red attache case. He drives around Jericho  in a Mercedes 230 loaned by a city resident, who has volunteered  to chauffeur him around: "The synagogue is the most sensitive  friction point we have in Jericho," he says as we drove to the  site. When we got there, about 30 settlers, including Knesset  Member Hanan Porat, were inside. The settlers ignored him  almost completely. It was Brig. Gen. Naji's first-ever  encounter with settlers. He, too, seemed to be experiencing a  kind of a first-encounter shock. He made an effort to focus on  security problems. "They are here in accordance with the  agreement. I hope they are here to pray, not to stage a  provocation. I further hope the problems will be solved through  persuasion."    Brig. Gen. Naji was astounded to see weapons on the  settlers' shoulders. Captain Muhammad Lutfi, the Palestinian  security officer at the synagogue, did not exactly know what the  instructions were. "The settlers are armed. I must be given  instructions. Should they be allowed in with their arms or  not?" he asked. A brief conversation with Col. 'Ofer solved the  problem. "According to the agreement, they are allowed," he told  his PLO counterpart.    The first mini-friction occurred last Friday. A group of 10  Kakh members snuck into the synagogue after dark. The  Palestinian soldiers summoned the joint patrol which evacuated  the Kakh men from the area. Procedures worked. However, the  real tests still lie ahead.    The joint patrol makes its way along Route 90 on an average  of once every half an hour. The Palestinian vehicles  occasionally change. Their car pool is still small, and  consists of 10 Toyota and 8 Land Rover jeeps. The Land Rovers  were given them as a gift by King Husayn when he bid farewell to  the soldiers two hours before they entered Jericho. On the  first day of the joint patrols it was the Israeli jeep that had  problems. The Palestinian officer knew something about  mechanics and helped repair it.    Moshe, a blue-uniformed Israeli policemen, regularly takes  part in the patrols: "I do my job according to instructions,  exactly by the book. The feeling is good. Personal relations  have not yet emerged but, in my opinion, personal relations are  not necessary in this job. They are serious in their attitude.  They know how to speak on the radio in order to conduct the  patrols properly. In this respect, they know their job."    We met Wa'il Muhammad Subhi in the Palestinian jeep. He  comes from Kafr al-Labad near Tulkarm. He left the West Bank in  1967 and joined the Palestinian Liberation Army. As soon as he  gets his first leave he will visit his relatives in the village.  At the moment, his wife and four children are still in Jordan.  After three days of joint patrols Wa'il Muhammad manages to see  the half-full cup: "We ate together, we smoked cigarettes  together. It is 70-80 percent all right. We talked. They  asked us about our past. We do not frighten them, and they do  not frighten us. If only it remains this way."</p>

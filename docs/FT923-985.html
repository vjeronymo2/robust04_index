			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Public sector pay now ahead PUBLIC-SECTOR pay has outstripped pay in the private sector for the first time since 1986, according to the government's New Earnings Survey, Lisa Wood writes. It shows that average gross weekly earnings of all full-time employees were Pounds 305 in April and that earnings in the previous year rose more for women than for men and more for non-manual workers than for manual workers. But the survey showed that employees in the public sector had been less affected by the recession. Public-sector earnings averaged Pounds 307.80 compared with Pounds 303.30 in the private sector, representing increases of 8.8 per cent and 6.3 per cent respectively on the previous April. The survey says that over a two-year period which included part of the recession cumulative pay increases were 21 per cent in the public sector and 14 per cent in the private sector.

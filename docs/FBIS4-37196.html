			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Aluf Ben] </F>   [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] In their discussions on the  interim agreement for the West Bank, Israel and the PLO will  discuss determining the municipal boundaries of Jerusalem, which  will be outside the autonomy. Israel is demanding that the  current municipal boundaries, determined in 1967, be maintained.  In recent discussions in government forums, a proposal was made  to ease the restrictions imposed on the entry of Palestinians  from the West Bank into the city in return for a PLO agreement  to make changes in the municipal boundaries in order to reduce  friction between Jews and Arabs in Jerusalem.    In a previous discussion on Jerusalem, held on 26 May, Prime  Minister Rabin decided to prevent the establishment of new  Palestinian political bodies and ban their policing activity in  the city.    The prime minister instructed the Israel Police and the Shin  Bet to closely monitor Orient House, the seat of the Palestinian  delegation in East Jerusalem, and to immediately put an end to  any illegal activity uncovered there. Over the past several  days, security elements have reported that the preventive  activity undertaken by the police and the Shin Bet regarding  Orient House has led the Palestinians to "lower their profile"  and curbed illegal activity in the building. [passage omitted]    In recent discussions between Police Minister Moshe Shahal  and Faysal al-Husayni, the minister proposed that the parties  draft a joint list of Palestinian institutions operating in East  Jerusalem to serve as a basis for maintaining the status quo in  the city, as promised by Israel in Foreign Minister Shim'on  Peres' letter of 11 October 1993. Israel promised to protect  the functioning of all the Palestinian institutions in the city.  [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / International Company News: Slow growth in telephone traffic hits KDD returns THE slowest growth in international telephone traffic from Japan for almost 35 years was the main factor behind a 5.1 per cent drop in half-year pre-tax profits at Kokusai Denshin Denwa, the Japanese international telecommunications group known as KDD. The company's pre-tax profits for the six months to September were Y13.2bn (Dollars 107m), about 5.1 per cent down on the same period last year. KDD executives said the fall in profits was due largely to extremely slow growth in telephone traffic from Japan, a reflection of the slowdown in the economy. The depression in the Japanese financial services sector, which has been cutting back on its overseas activities to reduce costs, is thought to be one factor behind the fall in call volumes. KDD said international call volumes were just 1.6 per cent up on last year, the worst rate of growth since there was a 4.3 per cent decline in 1958. The company's overall sales in the first half of the year were 2.8 per cent up at Y120.2bn. Income from its main telephone business fell 2.3 per cent, largely because of the much slower growth in call volumes and a switch to cheaper rate calls. For the year as a whole, KDD expects cost-cutting measures to allow it to make a pre-tax profit of about Y26bn, unchanged from last year on a 0.6 per cent increase in sales to Y243bn.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed H.T.: "Aeronautics -- Europe Strikes </F> Back..."]    [Text] European consortium Airbus Industries announced  yesterday that it was considering filing a GATT complaint  against the trade policy of U.S. manufacturers. The European  Commission, however, does not seem to be in a hurry to come to  the rescue of European industry.    The solemn announcement by U.S. President Bill Clinton of an  order for some 60 civilian aircraft from Saudi Arabia has been  making a few waves. First of all, because it is unusual for a  head of state to announce such commercial transactions. And  also, because, by choosing to make the announcement himself, Mr.  Clinton gives rise to speculation on the conditions surrounding  the award of the contract. The facts: Intent on renovating its  fleet, Saudi Airlines had initiated talks with the world's three  leading airliner manufacturers, America's Boeing and  McDonnell-Douglas and Europe's Airbus. High-level U.S.  Administration officials went on several trips to Riyadh, while  Bill Clinton repeatedly said he would use all his influence to  tip the scales in favor of the U.S. manufacturers.    The talks began in the spring of 1993 and are not officially  over and, in response to a Saudi request, Airbus Industries has  extended the validity of its offer until 1 March. All this does  not prevent President Clinton from announcing that the contract  has been awarded to "his" manufacturers. Some information even  trickles out as to the way the bounty is to be distributed  between Boeing and McDonnell-Douglas; it is indicated that the  order for civilian aircraft could be accompanied with another  order for KC135 flying tankers, and the whole package is funded  by a loan from Eximbank, an institution whose role is the same  as that of the French COFACE [French Insurance Company for  External Trade]. Worth noting, however, is the fact that the  U.S. manufacturers, the Saudi authorities, and the Saudi airline  have not followed Bill Clinton's lead and are keeping remarkably  quiet.  <H5>  GATT Complaint </H5>   The Europeans maintain they have received no official  confirmation. Nevertheless, in the meantime, Airbus Industries'  legal staff has begun working on a possible GATT complaint.  Article 4 of the Agreement forbids any state incentive in favor  of commercial deals, even in the form of debt rescheduling or  military agreements. On the other hand, the absence of an  official confirmation from the main parties leaves room for  doubt, yet some people go so far as to speculate that this was a  last-minute attempt by the U.S. Administration to secure the  contract.    In any event, the behavior of Bill Clinton and his officials  amply justifies the often-expressed fears of European  manufacturers. Indeed, it seems to demonstrate once again, and  in a most obvious manner, that for the United States trade  liberalization is nothing more than an export commodity. All  this does not bode well for the future talks meant to settle the  aeronautics issue. One remembers that when the GATT deal was  concluded on 15 December 1993, this issue was left "on the back  burner." An interim agreement remains in force until new  negotiations are completed. Should there be no new agreement,  however, the aeronautics industry will have to comply with the  general rules. And, as emphasized by manufacturers, a strategic  sector such as aeronautics -- whose production cycles are very  long and which requires considerable investment levels -- cannot  do without state support.    In such a context, the Americans only need to play for time.  The European system is based on refundable state advances which  are considered to be direct subsidies and are perfectly  identifiable. But they often exceed 5 percent of a new  aircraft's development costs. In the United States, however,  subsidies are channeled primarily through state agencies and are  allocated as research contracts. Furthermore, the volume of  orders placed by the U.S. Administration by far exceeds that of  the two A310's placed by the French Air Force, and the United  States has myriad "militarized" versions of civilian aircraft,  with the most famous being the KC135 and EC135, both derived  from the ancient Boeing 707.    For the Europeans, this challenge could not have come at a  worse time. Aircraft manufacturers face a worldwide crisis in  air transport, which has been driving orders down, as well as  cuts in military budgets. Of course, in the latter case,  manufacturers need not be concerned with general trade rules.  However, it is worth noting that the order for three Rafale  fighter aircraft to be funded from the 1993 budget has only  recently been placed with the manufacturer. Moreover, the lack  of multiyear programs excludes any potential economies of scale,  with respect to supplies, for instance. Therefore one can  understand easily the fears of the manufacturers, who are faced  with the prospect of a sweeping implementation of trade  agreements which are not suited to their field of activity.  This explains their current lobbying activities in France and  Germany, which are meant to raise government awareness and to  request -- should the parties fail to reach an agreement -- the  establishment of a subsidy system similar to the one used by the  Americans.</p>

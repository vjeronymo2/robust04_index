			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (16): Reality falls short of theory - Bonds / They're usually a sound investment in recession. So what's gone wrong? THE BULL run in global bond markets ground unceremoniously to a halt in March. Bond prices fell back in all major markets, eroding the capital gains seen by investors during 1991 and the early part of this year. Worst hit was the UK government bond market, where the election crystallised fears - about an increased supply of gilts, for example - which investors had hitherto glossed over. According to figures from JP Morgan, a balanced portfolio of gilts gave a negative return of 2.44 per cent during the month. But the gilts market was not alone in facing a crisis of confidence. Only four of the 12 markets measured by the JP Morgan Bond Index Monitor showed a positive return during March. The best performer was the Australian government bond market, which returned a miserly 1.08 per cent - still not enough to drag investors into profit for the quarter following an appalling performance during January and February. So why have bonds performed so badly in so many markets? After all, bonds are usually regarded as an excellent investment during recession, and there is little sign of a global economic upturn. As governments cut interest rates to stimulate economic activity, bond yields fall to match - meaning that bond prices rise, presenting bond holders with a comfortable capital gain. Disgruntled bond market investors might reasonably ask why theory has failed to deliver at this point in the economic cycle. Different factors are at work in different markets, but some of the common themes are: Fear of inflation is bad for bonds, because rising prices erode the real return available from fixed-interest investments. Where bond market investors see inflation coming, bond yields rise. While interest rates should still fall in many economies, there are fears that inflation has not been bought under control. For example, bond market analysts and economists are starting to talk about 'stagflation' in the German economy, the combination of depressed economic activity and high inflation. Faced with persistent inflationary pressures, it now seems unlikely that the Bundesbank will lower German interest rates until much later this year. German government bond prices fell sharply as the market adjusted its expectations. Fear of inflationary pressures was also a factor behind the jitters of the US bond market over the quarter. Amid signs that the US economy is moving out of recession, 10-year US bond yields rose from 6.90 per cent at the turn of the year to 7.70 by the end of March. Fear of high government borrowing, and therefore a high level of bond issuance, has been most noticeable in the UK. Going into the election, all the main political parties were committed to increases in public expenditure which could not be financed out of taxation. Just how much will be borrowed from the bond markets depends on what economic growth the government is able to deliver, and therefore how much can be raised from taxation. However, a public sector borrowing requirement of even Pounds 30bn this year - at the lower end of current forecasts - translates into a lot of new government bonds. This is expected to limit the potential for a rise in gilts prices for some time. Political uncertainty is difficult to quantify, but undoubtedly has an unsettling effect on bond markets, reducing the number of buyers and sellers, and increasing volatility of bond prices. Intermediaries in the international bond market have complained for weeks that institutional investors are unwilling to commit funds. Recent elections in the UK, France, and Italy, and the prospect of a presidential election in the US in the autumn, have added to the prevailing mood of uncertainty. But even without elections, there is little consensus among professionals on the economic outlook. For example, Credit Suisse First Boston started its latest investment outlook: 'Is the world heading for a vigorous supply-led boom or a prolonged and dangerous slump? Paradoxically, either outcome is plausible in the longer run.' Above all, however, many bond markets were probably due for a correction following a remarkable rally over the past year. The gilts market may have fallen during March, but it has still delivered a healthy 11 per cent return over the last 12 months. Despite a dismal first quarter, investors in Australian government bonds have earned an outstanding 18 per cent return over the same period. But choppy market conditions have been reflected in the performance of bond funds, probably the easiset way for private investors to play international bond markets. According to Finstat figures, only four of the 25 available international bond funds turned in a positive return during March. Yet well managed (and perhaps a touch lucky) fund managers can turn in a good performance even in a volatile market. For the three months as a whole, the best performer among the 25 funds was the Whittingdale US Government Bond Fund, which showed an admirable 7 per cent growth. Of the more diversified funds, the best return for the quarter was by the Guinness Flight Global High Income fund, which specialises in buying high-yielding bonds such as Spanish peseta and lire bonds. The fund returned 4.3 per cent over the three months.</p>

			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Finance and the Family: Money-back tax offer MILLIONS on low incomes should pay heed to an Inland Revenue advertising campaign launched this week: it could give them up to Pounds 860 a year in refunds on taxes. The Revenue is spending Pounds 2m on a campaign, aimed particularly at pensioners and married women who do not work, who may be entitled to back taxes. Newspaper and television advertisements will form the backbone of efforts to catch the eye of the two-thirds of people who are eligible to claim but have not done so. About 8m will also receive a leaflet with their annual notice of coding. Those affected include 2.5m married women who can claim back the tax credit on share dividends, and up to 15m people on low incomes who can register to receive bank and building society interest gross. During the 1991-92 tax year, the Revenue estimated that only Pounds 150m of the Pounds 550m which could have been reclaimed was paid out, because only about 5m people contacted them for refunds. The disappointing response came in spite of intensive advertising in the last two years. It contributed to the Revenue's decision in late 1992 to close a number of repayment offices and to reduce staff working in these divisions by up to 1,000. The Revenue estimates that those who have not claimed under either scheme include 4m pensioners, 3m married women and 3m other adults and children. Substantial ignorance of who is eligible remains. A large number who claimed were not on sufficiently low incomes to qualify, while many who were did not bother. A free telephone number (0800-660800) open from 10am-5pm on Monday to Friday has already begun operating and will run at least until the end of March. Independent taxation of married men and women was introduced in April 1990 and allowed women to claim back share dividend tax. Gross payments of bank and building society interest were introduced in April 1991. Two leaflets are available free from the Revenue: Leaflet IR 110. A guide for people with savings. Leaflet IR 127. Are you paying too much tax on your savings?</p>

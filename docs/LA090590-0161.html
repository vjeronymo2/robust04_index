			<p><P> September 5, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CAPSULE REVIEW;  </P> <P> MUSIC CENTER OPERA OPENS WITH A TROUBLED 'FIDELIO'  </P> <P> Inside the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion on Tuesday, the Music Center Opera opened  its fifth ambitious season with the glorious pathos of "Fidelio."  </P> <P> Outside the Pavilion, the performance-artist Tim Miller and numerous  colleagues, all clad in striped prison garb, staged their own ironic overture  to Beethoven's ode to freedom. It was an agitprop demonstration protesting  governmental interference in the arts. In many ways, the political action on  the plaza proved more compelling than the political action on the stage.  </P> <P> Gotz Friedrich, the celebrated director from Berlin, wrote in a program note  that "Fidelio" "takes place wherever and whenever terrorism and violence  threaten mankind." He saw "no basic demand to update the piece" from the  18th-Century Spain envisioned by the composer. If only he had the courage of  his aesthetic convictions.  </P> <P> He placed the action in a stylized prison courtyard, dominated by movable  black-brick walls and a central, all-too-modern guard tower. The prisoners had  to be concentration-camp inmates. Leonore, disguised as the hardy hero, sported  blue jeans. The villainous Don Pizarro, who came equipped with de rigueur  shades, resembled a spidery fusion of Nosferatu and a Storm Trooper.  Marzelline, the erstwhile soubrette, underwent erotic paroxysms when she  declared her yearning for Fidelio. Jacquino became a nasty, leather-jacketed  thug.  </P> <P> One must admire Friedrich's probing intellect. Sometimes, unfortunately, he  seems inclined to probe too far in the wrong direction.  </P> <P> The theatrical excesses of his "Fidelio" could have been mitigated by inspired  musical impulses. On this occasion, inspiration turned out to be painfully  scarce.  </P> <P> Jiri Kout, the conductor, slighted the majesty, the sweep and the poignancy of  the score in favor of speed for its own breathless sake. The cast looked fine.  For the most part, it sounded feeble.  </P> <P> Karan Armstrong -- who happens to be married to Friedrich -- acted the title  role with fine, muted ardor tinged with telling desperation. Her lyric soprano  came to grief, however, in the high climaxes. Gary Bachlund sang Florestan with  the warm, fervent tone of a bona fide junior Heldentenor, but paced himself  badly. Michael Devlin blustered stoically as the Nazi ogre.  </P> <P> Only one principal sustained world-class standards. Matti Salminen defined the  usual paternal platitudes with booming basso amplitude, with incisive  articulation of the German text and with hearty if not too folksy generosity of  spirit. He towered above his colleagues, both literally and figuratively. If  only the opera were called "Rocco."  </P> <P> A complete review runs in Thursday's Calendar section.  </P></p>

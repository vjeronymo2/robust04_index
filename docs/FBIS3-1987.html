			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Times Call Upon Heroes, Bring Up </F> Heroes--on Learning From Xu Honggang"]    [Text] Shortly after the Lunar New Year, a young hero's  name-- Xu Honggang--rapidly spread inside and outside the  barracks and across the entire country. Jiang Zemin and other  leading cadres of the CPC Central Committee and Central Military  Commission cordially met Xu Honggang and praised him warmly for  his heroic deeds. The General Political Department and the  Central Committee of the Communist Youth League jointly issued a  circular calling on the whole nation to emulate Xu Honggang.  Why did the deeds of an ordinary soldier produce such a strong  reaction and evoke such extensive echoes? In the final  analysis, it is because his magnificent feats reflect the  people's aspirations and respond to the call of the times.    Our era is a great one in which we have initiated the  brilliant cause of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics. The themes of our era comprise Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics; the party's basic line; the ideology and spirit  of patriotism, collectivism, socialism, and revolutionary  heroism; an ideology and spirit that is beneficial to reform,  opening up, and modernization and national unity, social  progress, and the people's happiness; and the ideology and  spirit of striving for a happy life through honest labor. The  noble thoughts and heroic deeds of Xu Honggang are precisely a  resounding song with the main melody of the times. He rushed to  help comrades in danger or difficulty, earnestly practiced what  he advocated for the socialist cause, is irreconcilable towards  ugly phenomena, and persistently performs the duties of a  soldier. His thoughts and actions reflect the traditional  virtues of the Chinese nation, shining with the glow of  socialist ideology and morality, and mirror the fine traditions  of our party and Army, which shimmer with the brand new spirit  of the times. He boasts the common valuable character of the  heroes of the older generations as well as the distinguishing  features of a hero of the current generation. He is a brilliant  model of a soldier because of his courage in devoting himself to  a cause which is of universal significance to building up a  healthy social atmosphere. This is the basic reason why Xu  Honggang's deeds produced such a great appealing effect.    If any nation wants to be rejuvenated and any society wants  to make changes, it should portray heroes and heroic images  suitable to the requirements of the times so that people can be  inspired and motivated. Just as the years of the revolutionary  war called for heroic fighters to break through the brambles and  thorns and to charge and shatter enemy positions, today, the  accomplishment of the magnificent cause of building socialism  with Chinese characteristics likewise calls for heroic people to  lead the broad masses to forge ahead and the advanced elements  in society to take the lead in developing the "five kinds of  revolutionary spirit" advocated by Comrade Deng Xiaoping and the  "64-character pioneering spirit" emphasized by Comrade Jiang  Zemin. They must have lofty ideals, take the overall interests  into consideration, be ready to dedicate themselves to a cause,  abide by social ethics, and have a high sense of responsibility,  a healthy tendency of fostering justice and combating evil, the  noble character of supporting those in danger and assisting  those in difficulty, and the pioneering spirit of keeping on  fighting in spite of all setbacks. With these, they can bring  about a fundamental improvement of social morality and promote  the constant advance of socialist spiritual civilization, so  that our undertaking of reform, opening up, and modernization  can march from victory to victory. This is precisely the social  cause of heroic people emerging in great multitudes, who,  singing the resonant songs of righteousness, have lived up to  the earnest expectations of the broad masses. The hero Xu  Honggang sprung up in response to the times.    Marxism tells us that the growth of a hero is closely  connected with the times he is in and the cause he takes up.  The great cause of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics is one that calls for heroes, and the practice  of pioneering a cause to build socialism with Chinese  characteristics is a vast arena for bringing up heroes. In  tracing the footprint of Comrade Xu Honggang's growth, we can  clearly note that Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics was the most valuable  nourishment for his mind; the fiery life of reform, opening up,  and the drive for modernization is an exceptionally fine  environment for his growth; the People's Army that boasts the  true character of the veteran Red Army and the tradition of  revolutionary heroism is a revolutionary furnace in which he is  tempered; and the spirit of the masses who work hard to change  the world in heading for a relatively comfortable life is the  source of strength that urges him to make advances. In short,  the spirit of our times, the fine tradition of our party, the  heroic character of our Army, and the traditional virtues of the  Chinese nation are all vividly reflected in him. It is an  essential demand of our times to bring up group after group of  heroic people like Xu Honggang. This represents the mainstream  of our times. In the high tide of reform and opening up, those  who indulge in money worship and pleasure- seeking and those  extreme individualists will certainly be eliminated by the  times, as they run counter to the historical trend.    In emulating Xu Honggang, we must act like him in responding  to the call of the times with our practical actions. Every  comrade should think over such a serious question: Can we do  what Xu Honggang has done under the same blue sky and on the  same earth? The great era of reform and opening up and the  magnificent practice of army modernization have provided  everyone with more or less the same environment for growth and  the same arena of life, but each person's performance in  response to the call of the times is entirely different. Why?  There are many aspects, and the most fundamental is whether he  can sincerely and realistically put into practice the spirit of  the times. Xu Honggang has done it honestly. He has armed his  own mind with the great theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics, nurtured himself with the glorious  traditions of veteran Red Army men, portrayed his own image with  the noble spirit of serving the people with heart and soul, and  trained himself through his dedication to the arduous practice  of the national defense undertaking. Instead of uttering heroic  words, he cherishes lofty aspirations and is ready to be devoted  and to make sacrifices. It is precisely this spirit that makes  Xu Honggang a hero. When we learn from Xu Honggang, we should  particularly emulate this kind of spirit. With such a spirit,  anyone can be another Xu Honggang when he is called to take up  the cudgels for a just cause, another Su Ning when he is called  for to devote himself to the modernization of national defense,  another Huang Jiguang or Dong Cunrui when he is called to charge  the enemy lines, and another Lei Feng when he is called to make  contributions in an ordinary post.    Heroes are the pioneers of the times and models for the  masses. The more heroes like Xu Honggang we have, the more  cohesive our society will be, the stronger our Army's combat  capacity will become, and the more our cause will flourish. We  must enthusiastically respond to the call of Chairman Jiang and  the Central Military Commission; conscientiously put into effect  the guidelines of the circular jointly issued by the General  Political Department and the Communist Youth League Central  Committee; extensively and profoundly conduct activities of  emulating the hero Xu Honggang; bring up more new socialist  personalities with lofty ideals, moral integrity, education, and  a sense of discipline; and repeatedly push forward the building  of a revolutionized, modernized, and regularized Army!</p>

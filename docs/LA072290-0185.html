			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TINY DROPS A LIFELINE FOR TREES  </P> <P> This plea for trees from Santa Barbara landscape architect Isabelle C. Greene,  addressed specifically to drought-cursed Santa Barbarans, can be taken to heart  by all who are doing their best to save water. Greene is a granddaughter of  Henry Greene, one of the brothers who made the bungalow and the Craftsman  movement almost synonymous with California.  </P> <P>  -- Robert Smaus  </P> <P> Times Garden Editor  </P> <P> We are all reminded again that we live in a special climate: not like the rainy  east, nor the steamy tropics, nor humid Japan, nor the short-season Arctic.  </P> <P> The unique beauty around us is derived from the fact that there is hardly an  overabundance of water in any year and thus no resulting overstatement of plant  growth, nor vast bodies of water, nor any other manifestations of wet climates.  </P> <P> We have instead rugged mountains sweeping down to the coast; undulating  foothills and valleys briefly clothed with plants for one brief, ephemeral  period in the spring. For the rest of our warm season we have a tawny covering  of standing grasses covering and battening down the soil. There are as well our  rugged and rich chaparral and stands of live oaks, securely waiting until the  next rainfall.  </P> <P> This gentle beauty that pervades our land was exactly what drew people to the  area two centuries ago, seeking a better and more abundant life in balance with  its mild environment. It surrounds us still and is there to be drawn on and  enjoyed, even during the deep troughs of our normal dry cycles.  </P> <P> However, we must be watchful so that none of that which is permanently  beautiful is permanently destroyed by our actions. This year we are all  watching our toilet flushings, our car washings, our lawn waterings, our water  meters, our huge water bills, our fights with our politicians and neighbors --  all the frantic activities of a short year. We are also making critical choices  of what to water and what to spare.  </P> <P> Your lawn, after all, can be replaced, your annuals are replaced every year,  your herbaceous borders can be economically purchased in small nursery  containers and your bulbs will survive; but what may not survive in three years  of sequential deterioration is the tree heritage of your beautiful city, county  and state.  </P> <P> Use the precious water you have to soak all your trees through the efficiency  of a drip irrigation system. There is no time to lose; summer's heat is upon  us. The deep roots of the trees have been stressed through two summers already,  and the water table has dropped too far for some roots to reach.  </P> <P> The trees have been subject to disease in their weakened state for two years,  and in the months following, many will succumb without help. Even the hardiest  of native and drought-tolerant trees, once adjusted to the regular waterings  that a garden receives, will suffer as their waterings diminish: they are no  longer outfitted to drought conditions. Due to well-drilling and other  disturbances, the ground water upon which deep-rooted trees depend, is no  longer available. Smog and other human-introduced conditions, add to the toward  stress and disease.  </P> <P> Imagine the return of a wet year: Your house, yard, estate, garden or park will  have the lawns replanted and the roses will be blooming, but the magnificent  oaks will be gone. Or the majestic pines, the broad strutting elms or sycamores  or the cypress hanging onto the bluff -- all of those will simply be no more.  </P> <P> To a lesser extent, also conserve your shrubs, the large plants of maturity and  grace. Make sure that they, too, do not deteriorate. It is much more expensive  to replace them than the smaller plants from seeds or one-gallon cans.  </P> <P> Be forewarned: larger trees and shrubs do not show their stress immediately;  you may not pick up on their distress within the first six months, particularly  if you are not a garden horticulturist.  </P> <P> By the time the foliage color has shifted, and you notice tracings in the bark,  wilting leaves or other such gross changes, it is probable that the structure  of the tree itself has lost the battle and you have lost your tree.  </P> <P> Please do not wait for the signs. Act now: call your gardener, call a  contractor, go to your nurseryman, read books, go to the library, call on a  tree specialist or call in an arborist.  </P> <P> Additionally, your local city, county and state government can provide more  valuable information about how to ride through the drought. Lay out your drip  lines and immediately begin deep-soaking the priceless greenery of this place  we all love to live in.  </P> <P> For the sake of this Earth, and your particular spot: for your enjoyment for  what you do now, and for what you enjoy in the future, take care of these  things that have been so good to you.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] "The deployment of any forces in Abkhazia without  its leadership's consent is ruled out," the chairman of  Abkhazia's parliament, Vladislav Ardzinba, told Interfax on  Wednesday.    With reference to the possible participation of military  contingents from CIS countries in the peace-keeping forces in  Abkhazia he said that "it is possible only in the framework of  documents signed on April 4."    In comments on the talks on Abkhazia's political status  which  began in Geneva on Tuesday Ardzinba stressed that "there is no  alternative to peace negotiations." According to him, when  taking part in the negotiating process Abkhazia proceeds from  the agreements signed in Moscow on April 4." "On the contrary,  the Georgian side seems to have forgotten about it," the  Abkhazian leader pointed out.    As he said, the statement made on Georgian radio on Monday  by  the Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze, as to "the possibility  of resolving the conflict militarily", cannot be understood in  any other way. According to Ardzinba, this is "a gross  violation of the documents signed in Moscow."    On April 4 in Moscow the two sides signed a statement on  ways  to reach a political solution to the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict  and an agreement on the voluntary return of refugees and  displaced persons.</p>

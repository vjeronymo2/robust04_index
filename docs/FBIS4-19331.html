			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Spadolini Officially Candidate for </F> Senate Speakership"]    [Text] (ANSA) Rome, April 15 -- Shortly before the  inaugural session of the XII legislature at Palazzo Madama this  morning, Life Senator Giovanni Spadolini announced that he had  acceded to the appeal from various political forces represented  in the Upper Chamber and agreed to put his name up for the  Senate Speakership, the post he held in the outgoing legislature.    "I have always conceived of the role of Senate speaker as a  role `super partes', necessarily having no political strings  attached," Spadolini said. He underscored the need of the  speaker to defend the principles of democracy and a "correct  dialectic among all the political forces within a civil  confrontation of ideas" which must never be allowed to  degenerate into mere "insults and provocations."    The senate speaker must be the guarantor for the rights of  both the majority and the minority, he insisted. The current  situation of the senate is the most delicate in its history and  that balance must be preserved which is so fundamental to the  future of the legislature and to the proper functioning of the  democratic institutions, Spadolini said.    These balances are the fruit of a complex and complicated  history which cannot easily be reduced to prefabricated  diagrams, he continued. For this reason, Spadolini said he was  offering himself as a candidate that he claimed would provide an  institutional guarantee of that impartiality and equidistance  which he said he has sought over the past seven years as speaker  to provide the nation, in keeping with the spirit of the  constitution.    The 122 senators of the Progressive Pole, at an  early-morning  meeting, unanimously decided to back Spadolini's candidacy. Just  before the Senate assembly began, the 30 senators of the  People's Party also decided to back Spadolini.</p>

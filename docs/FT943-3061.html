			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: BP firm against the trend A reiteration of NatWest Securities' positive stance, plus a profits upgrade and expectations of good news from today's presentation to analysts, helped British Petroleum shares extend their recent outperformance against the rest of the stock market. The share price, which set an all-time high of 430p last week, ended the session a penny firmer at 417 1/2 p after heavy turnover of 13m shares. NatWest, in a buy note published yesterday, said BP shares have outperformed the UK market by 50 per cent since July 1992 and argued that 'steps taken to improve the competitiveness of its upstream business could boost earnings by some Pounds 440m, or 8p a share, at any given level of oil prices'. NatWest's oil team, adopting a conservative line on a new 'federal' structure in BP's upstream businesses which it said will drive the new competitiveness, increased its 1996 earnings per share forecast by 10 per cent to 40.4p and for 1997 by the same figure to 42.7p. The presentation to analysts, to be given by BP's exploration director Mr John Browne, is expected to include more good news from BP's operations across the globe, but especially from Colombia, Vietnam and west of the Shetland Islands.</p>

			<p><P> June 15, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> INVESTOR ALLEGES NEC SOUGHT TO INFLATE STOCK PRICES  </P> <P> An investor in National Education Corp. filed a lawsuit Wednesday accusing the  Irvine-based educational training firm and its chairman of releasing false and  misleading information about the company's financial prospects.  </P> <P> The suit was filed by David Grobow, who bought stock in the company on May 30,  four days after the company said its revenue and earnings would remain flat or  begin to decline during the second quarter.  </P> <P> Grobow claimed in the suit that National Education and its chairman, H. David  Bright, attempted to inflate stock prices until Monday of this week, when it  released an even more discouraging announcement.  </P> <P> On Monday, National Education's stock lost 18.5% of its value, falling $3.625  per share to close at $16 per share. It closed Wednesday at $17 a share, up  37.5 cents for the day.  </P> <P> The suit was filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles on behalf of investors  who purchased National Education stock between May 26 and June 12. During the  period, more than 3 million shares traded hands.  </P> <P> The suit said Grobow purchased 500 shares of stock at $20.375 per share for an  investment of $10,750.  </P> <P> National Education's general counsel Jeffrey Brill declined to comment on the  charges. He said the company had not received a copy of the lawsuit. Bright was  traveling and could not be reached for comment late Wednesday.  </P> <P> On May 26, National Education announced that its revenue and net income might  be flat to lower for the three months ending June 30 as compared to the second  quarter of 1988. The company said that sales at its Applied Learning subsidiary  had been weak but that its revenue outlook for the entire year remained strong  and it expected to make up any second quarter shortfall by year-end, the suit  said.  </P> <P> National Education stock fell $2.375 per share on the day of the announcement  to close at $21.125 per share.  </P> <P> On June 12, the company announced that disappointing results for May at the  Applied Learning subsidiary indicated National Education's second quarter  revenue and earnings might be "substantially lower" than the second quarter of  last year. It said that since its May release, revenue and expected revenue at  Applied Learning had failed to meet earlier expectations.  </P> <P> The suit claims that the company was aware at the time of the May 26 release  that the Applied Learning subsidiary would have disappointing preliminary  results but that the May statement was worded in an overly optimistic way in an  effort to prevent the company's stock price from sliding.  </P> <P> The suit also said that between Jan. 1 and June 12, four current or former  directors of the company sold a total of 131,000 shares of company stock.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, National Education's debt securities were placed under review  Wednesday by Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. The credit rating organization said it  placed $57.5 million of National Education bonds on its "Credit Watch" because  of weakened cash flow protection and concerns over the diminished earnings  outlook of the firm.  </P> <P> S&amp;P said that National Education's capital spending has risen sharply to  fund expansion in recent years and that the company's cash flow has been  weakened. National Education's total debt increased $48 million in the past  year and was $122 million on March 31, S&amp;P said.  </P></p>

			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / Minority targets for law firms 'unrealistic' SOLICITORS' firms in England and Wales are to be asked by the Law Society to adopt targets for the number of ethnic minority lawyers they employ. The general view among large City law firms yesterday was that the targets were unrealistic. Firms with fewer than five fee earners (lawyers and legal executives) will be excluded from strict compliance with the targets but are to be asked to use all reasonable efforts to adopt the target set for small firms. Small firms - those with between five and 10 fee earners - are to be asked to employ at least one fee earner from the ethnic minorities. Medium-sized firms - 11 to 50 fee earners - have been set a target of one ethnic minority trainee plus one other ethnic minority fee earner. Firms with more than 50 fee earners are to be asked to take 10 per cent of their trainees and 5 per cent of their other fee earners from the ethnic minorities. Although the targets are not mandatory, the society plans to enforce them through the back door. From September, all firms wishing to take on trainees will have to be licensed by the society. A condition of those licences will be that firms comply with the society's policies. Mr David Rance, personnel director of Freshfields, said the aim was 'laudable but totally impractical'. Mr Charles Dodson, recruitment partner at Lovell White Durrant, said he thought the targets might not be as drastic as they sounded. Most firms had not collated statistics on the ethnic background of their employees in the past and so had no idea how difficult it would be to comply.</p>

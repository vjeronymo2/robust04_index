			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / Consumer spending drop blamed on tax rises One of the first signs that April's tax increases could be sapping consumer confidence emerged yesterday, with the release of figures showing a surge in consumer borrowing in March - but a drop in discretionary spending in April. Data published by two credit organisations point to increased credit levels in the retail, car and home-loans sectors in March as consumers apparently ignored the impending tax rises. But figures released by Barclaycard, which represents 38 per cent of UK credit card spending, suggest the tax increases incorporated in April's pay packets are now reducing discretionary spending. The figures, which show the amounts processed by Barclaycard on any given day - indicating spending on that day or immediately before - suggest spending has dropped slightly compared with the equivalent period last year. On April 25, the amount processed by Barclaycard was 120 per cent of the amount processed on Monday, April 26 last year. By May 5, the cumulative figure over the previous two weeks had slipped to 106 per cent of the comparable 1993 figure. Mr Michael Head, who is in charge of planning and development at Barclaycard, admitted that the figures were 'not very exciting'. He added that, although consumers appeared to have discounted much of the impact of April's tax increases in the period since the November Budget, there could still be further slippage. 'It looks as though there may just be a slight tightening of the screw,' he said. This concern, however, is at odds with an upbeat message in a report published today by the Finance and Leasing Association on consumer credit in March, before the tax rises were introduced. The association represents companies accounting for 80 per cent of consumer credit and 30 per cent of business investment in plant and equipment. Total consumer credit rose to Pounds 1,463m in March, a growth of 44 per cent year-on-year (and 19 per cent compared with February), the association said. The biggest growth occurred in the retail sector, where purchases on store cards grew 57 per cent year-on-year, and 34 per cent month-on-month. Credit in the motor sector grew 37 per cent and personal loans rose 34 per cent year-on-year. The publication of these figures follows a weekend report by Infolink, the credit information organisation, which also found a credit surge and concluded that in March 'consumers remained unperturbed by April's impending tax increases'. The finance association also noted that the rise in business credit was relatively subdued, with an 8 per cent growth in business finance year-on-year - lower than previous months. Mr Tony Mallin, the association's chairman, said: 'The business figures for March are disappointing . . . in our view businesses are still not investing as much as we would have expected at this point in the cycle.'</p>

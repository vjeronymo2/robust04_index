To the extent possible, applicants should emphasize the uniqueness of the proposed graduate program of study. The summary should not include any reference to the specific number of fellowships requested. The information on the summary page will be used in assigning the most appropriate panelists to review a proposal. If a proposal is supported, this page may be used in program publications. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;3402.12  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> National need narrative. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A narrative for the national need area should be written in five sections limited to no more than 20 pages, and preceded by a table of contents. The table of contents is not considered part of the 20-page limitation. The narrative should be typed on one side of the page only, using a font no smaller than 12 point, and double-spaced. The five sections to be included in the narrative are as follows: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Sec. 1. In this section, applicants should establish clearly that the proposed program of study and research will result in the development of outstanding expertise in the national need area for which funding is requested and will do so in a reasonable period of time. Applicants should present a detailed description of the proposed graduate program of study and research. This section of the narrative should contain, but need not be limited to, the following components: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) The plan should specifically address the course work which Fellows will be required to take rather than the overall spectrum of departmental offerings. Identify courses, summarize content, and discuss sequencing. Explain how course work will relate to Fellows' research. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Identify and describe areas of research that Fellows will be encouraged to engage in via a thesis or dissertation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Discuss graduate program examination requirements, such as a proficiency or qualifying examination, a comprehensive examination, and an oral examination. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Include a projected timetable for completing the proposed graduate program of study and research. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) If admission to a proposed doctoral program does not require a Master's degree, discuss how institutional procedures allow for the bypass of a Master's degree. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sec. 2. In this section, applicants should highlight thoroughly any special features of the graduate program such as the extent to which it will involve an inter-disciplinary, multi-disciplinary, or cross-disciplinary approach resulting in the development of expertise transcending a single discipline. Applicants should also discuss any other special features such as development of an unusual collateral specialization in a related discipline, experiential learning opportunities such as practicums or internships, unique mentoring programs, seminars, or a multi-university collaborative approach. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

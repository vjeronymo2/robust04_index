			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Iraq bows to demolition of nuclear facilities IRAQ yesterday told United Nations inspectors that it would accede to their demand to destroy buildings and equipment at the al-Atheer complex near Baghdad - which UN experts say was central to Iraq's nuclear weapons programme. Mr Dimitri Perricos, who arrived in Baghdad with other International Atomic Energy Agency experts only yesterday, said the Iraqi government had said 'they have agreed to all proposals and decisions of the agency regarding the destruction of specified buildings in the al-Atheer site'. Mr Perricos said he will lead his team to al-Atheer today to begin work on the demolition. His inspectors are also set to visit 16 other sites said to be related to Iraq's nuclear weapons programme. Iraq's early decision not to resist the team's call to destroy parts of the al-Atheer site is the clearest demonstration yet of Baghdad's improved co-operation with UN inspectors charged with identifying and eliminating its nuclear and weapons programmes.</p>

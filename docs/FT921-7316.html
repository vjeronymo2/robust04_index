			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / BCCI: Demise sealed by a deal of sense and sensitivity IT'S not a cover-up or anything like that,' says Mr Brian Smouha, the Touche Ross partner overseeing the worldwide winding-up of BCCI. 'This is meant to make peace with the United Arab Emirates.' Mr Smouha is sensitive to accusations of cover-up. He has just hammered out a deal under which BCCI's majority shareholders in Abu Dhabi, part of the UAE, will pay up to Dollars 2.2bn to the bank's creditors. But the structure of the deal, and the lack of transparency as to how it has been negotiated, are prompting criticism. Both Mr Smouha and the Abu Dhabi camp claim that the deal is a generous one for creditors - though from information published so far, it is impossible to tell. It involves the bank's liquidators and majority shareholders giving up claims and counter-claims against each other, in return for which Abu Dhabi will pay Dollars 1.7bn to creditors (an amount that could rise or fall by as much as Dollars 500m, depending on what eventual liabilities of the bank are determined to be). Weighing up the claims and counter-claims is not easy. The liquidators, led by Mr Smouha, have agreed to give up their claims under Dollars 3.06bn of promissory notes issued by Abu Dhabi. The notes were given at the time of a proposed restructuring of the bank a year ago, so a legal question remains as to whether Abu Dhabi remains liable given that the restructuring was not completed. Also, the notes would have been payable over a seven-year period, reducing their present value. Abu Dhabi was also potentially liable for about Dollars 1bn of guarantees given to the bank. There are various unquantifiable further claims that could be made against Abu Dhabi. One of its representatives was a BCCI board member and has been identified by Price Waterhouse, the bank's auditors, as someone who was aware of the frauds at the bank before they became known to regulators and auditors. In return for accepting the deal, depositors will be asked to sign away rights 'against the majority shareholders of BCCI and certain related persons'. Potential claims the other way - against the bank by the majority shareholders - are equally difficult to establish with any certainty. Abu Dhabi has agreed to take on the UAE branches of the banks, which are estimated to have gross liabilities of about Dollars 1.5bn. Assets in these branches, which will also be taken on by Abu Dhabi, are estimated to amount to 10 per cent to 15 per cent of liabilities. This is about the same proportion as in the rest of the group. The result: stripping out the UAE branches has no overall effect on creditors. However, once it assumes responsibility for the UAE, Abu Dhabi will actually have a Dollars 700m claim against the rest of the bank, allowing it to claim as a creditor and share in its own compensation fund. Abu Dhabi has also said it will give up rights over about Dollars 2bn of funds which were held under management by the bank and were misappropriated by its directors. As one of these directors was an Abu Dhabi representative, it could have been difficult to recover this money through legal means. Even the Dollars 1.7bn or so is not being paid immediately, but over a period up to June 1994: that reduces its present value. If the deal is concluded, the Abu Dhabi payments are likely to account for the bulk of the money creditors can hope to get back. Mr Smouha said he expected to realise Dollars 1bn-Dollars 1.5bn from the bank's assets. Any realisations over Dollars 2.5bn would be divided equally with Abu Dhabi. The compensation deal with Abu Dhabi affects only creditors of the group's Luxembourg-based holding company, BCCI Holdings, and its two main operating arms, BCCI (Overseas) and BCCI SA. Creditors of other parts of the group, owed about Dollars 5.5bn between them, will receive only what local liquidators can recover. In many cases this will be substantial: creditors in Hong Kong were told this week they would get back 70 per cent to 75 per cent of their money. These entities were separately incorporated and regulated and so largely untouched by frauds in the core parts of the bank.</p>

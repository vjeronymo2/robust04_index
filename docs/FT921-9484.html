			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / Management: Why youngsters are taking their parents to work  -Childcare / Lisa Wood investigates the part played by Tecs in encouraging the provision of nursery places It was not until Kay Coleman became a director of her local Training and Enterprise council (Tec) that she realised something was amiss in her own company. 'One of the issues that kept coming up at Tec board meetings was nursery provision in the Oldham area,' she says. With an eye to recruitment at the medium-sized clothing company which she runs, she decided to open a nursery. Because of the recession, she found that hiring staff was less of a problem than she had expected. However the nursery - which opened in 1990 and offers 30 places - is paying off in other ways. 'We are getting increased productivity from mothers who bring their children to the nursery. They tend to come in earlier, stay longer and appear more settled.' Oldham Tec may have provided the inspiration for the nursery but it provided no money. But Oldham, along with the new network of 81 other Tecs, is seeking to play a part as a partner and catalyst in the provision of nurseries and child - care. This is part of a wider brief of promoting opportunities for women - including paying childcare costs for single-parent trainees. It is a role most Tecs appear to be taking seriously, albeit in varying ways. Some Tecs, including Hertfordshire Tec, are helping to set up nurseries in partnership with employers and local authorities. Others are training unemployed people to set-up after-school clubs. As with other Tec activities, results vary in quantity and quality, depending in part on how long a Tec has been established. Many of those Tecs with the most progressive policies have female chief executives, such as Olivia Grant at Tyneside Tec, or confident women board members, such as Coleman at Oldham Tec. A survey conducted last summer by The National Council for Voluntary Organisations (NCVO) and Daycare Trust-The National Childcare Campaign showed that: More than one-third of the 50 Tecs that responded had a specific policy on childcare. More than half had a strategy or statement on childcare. More than half had an advisory group which considered childcare issues as part of its remit. Forty per cent had a staff member with responsibility for childcare issues. Half had discussed with other agencies the development of local childcare facilities, for the under fives, for after-school care and for holiday play schemes. A quarter had encouraged collaboration between employers and local authorities on out-of-school and holiday childcare schemes, with a further 36 per cent proposing to do so. The authors of the report said the seniority of members of staff with responsibility had a direct influence on the extent to which childcare issues were taken seriously. Olivia Grant of Tyneside Tec said childcare was important from the start. 'It was a message we got from the community and was raised by several employers too,' she says. The Tec appointed an officer to investigate local childcare. Her investigations showed patchy provision in the area, although some local authorities, notably North Tyneside borough council, provided good facilities. She concluded that the greatest immediate need was after-school and holiday care. A pilot programme - called the Kids Club Enterprise Course - is being set up, under which the Tec is training people to provide local childcare facilities. Places are funded under the Employment Training (ET) scheme for the long-term unemployed. The programme will be run by a local enterprise agency in partnership with the Kids Club Network, a charity working to promote after-school care of children. Courses will include advice on developing business plans and how to acquire premises. The Tec believes its money is best used training people who want to work with children rather than investing in bricks and mortar. 'We do not want to be an alternative social services department,' says Grant. As part of the aim to help individuals, the Tec will consider offering them its Enterprise Allowance which gives financial help to unemployed people who want to set up their own businesses. Tyneside Tec, which has has a women's advisory group drawn from the local population, has a number of other initiatives, including one to support training courses for ethnic minority women who want to be child minders. 'We have not got all the answers but people are helping us to ask the right questions and frame solutions which we hope will be effective,' says Grant.

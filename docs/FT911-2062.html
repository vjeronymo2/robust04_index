			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Turkey and Iran unite on need for refugee return TURKEY and Iran have agreed on the need for nearly 2m Iraqi refugees who have flooded across their borders to return home as soon as possible, the Turkish Foreign Ministry said yesterday, Our Foreign Staff reports. As Kurdish refugees trudged down the mountains on the Turkey-Iraq frontier towards the allied 'safe haven' around the Iraqi town of Zakho, President Turgut Ozal was hosting a visit by President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani of Iran. 'We have no divergence of opinion on this matter,' a Turkish Foreign Ministry official said. 'Both countries think these people constitute an element of instability caused by the (Iraqi) administration and they must be repatriated as soon as possible.' Thousands of Iraqi refugees, most of them Kurds, have returned to Iraq since Monday, although their progress in vehicles and on foot was slowed yesterday by heavy rains. 'It's bedlam in the rain,' said a British Royal Marine. A UN official in Ankara, however, said the UN was concerned that the repatriation was moving too quickly and without due regard for the wishes of the refugees and their long-term security. In Geneva, the International Committee of the Red Cross said it was setting up seven reception camps to accommodate 100,000 refugees along the Iranian border with Iraq.

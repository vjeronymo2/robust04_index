			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / Company News (This Week): Bread and butter business may silence critics - Tomkins Tomkins, the industrial conglomerate headed by Mr Greg Hutchings, reports annual figures today which may finally silence the critics of its Pounds 990m takeover of Ranks Hovis McDougall in December 1992. Analysts expect the food group to have contributed profits of around Pounds 100m despite the pressure on UK grocery prices, particularly in bread. The cakes business has been weak with the performance from Mr Kipling expected to be 'exceedingly dull' according to one analyst. But the improvement in milling is thought to have accelerated in the second half along with a recovery in RHM's US operations where it sells peanut butter and ketchup. For the group as a whole, forecasts range from Pounds 255m to Pounds 265m, up from Pounds 171m the previous year, with earnings per share increasing by around 15 per cent. The dividend is likely to rise to between 7.1p and 7.35p, up from 6.35p. The old Tomkins businesses are thought to have had a mixed year in the US, with Murray Ohio, the lawnmower and bikes business suffering from fierce competition and poor weather, but the building products companies benefiting from recovery and gunmaker Smith &amp; Wesson showing good growth. The European businesses had a tougher time, but they constitute a relatively small proportion of the total group. Tomkins generates 60 per cent of its operating profit in dollars, and while there should be some translation gains in the year to April, the shares have fallen back recently as the American currency has weakened. Cash flow is thought to have been strong and the group recently made its first major acquisition since RHM, paying about Dollars 115m (Pounds 75.6m) for Canadian lawnmower group Noma Industries.</p>

			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Arts: Sentiment rules in the US - Concert On Sunday in the Barbican with Ivor Bolton, the London Symphony played a benefit concert for United World Colleges and the Variety Club of Great Britain. Even by benefit-concert standards, it was a pretty rum programme. Two obscure operatic numbers (Massenet, Rossini) for Ruggero Raimondi to sing, each prefaced with instrumental pieces from those composers' operas; and then a commissioned piece de resistance: a 'Peace' piece, conducted by its highly professional composer Marvin Hamlisch, whose scores have enlivened the musical A Chorus Line and - among many other movies - The Way We Were, which earned him Academy Awards. While the LSO addressed itself vigorously to Massenet's ballet music for Le Cid, I kept thinking how much better it would have been if his contemporary Chabrier had written it. Both composers began with similarly catchy trouvailles when aiming at broad, popular effects - but only Chabrier went on unfailingly to twist and subvert them until they crackled with fresh imagination. Then Raimondi impersonated Massenet's dying 'Don Quichotte' with grave tenderness and superbly even tone: if only Massenet's mawkish strings were less blatantly 'effective', and more elegantly composed] After that, the great bass enjoyed himself hugely in a patter-aria from Rossini's Viaggio a Reims (partly spoken); and then he stopped, when we felt we'd hardly heard him yet. Hamlisch's Anatomy of Peace, which was having its European premiere, was commissioned by United World Colleges. (The fund-raising co-Chairs for its US National Committee are his wife and Mrs Phyllis Rothschild Farley.) Juilliard-trained as he is, one hoped that 'his first commissioned work for symphony orchestra' would stretch him at last beyond the limits of Broadway, but it did not. We got his own printed scenario. A solo flute line, representing the 'one law' that should be the salvation of warring nations worldwide, would contend with noisy dissonances from 'national' factions. Little by little, the obstreperous ethnic voices would succumb to a deeply American ideal: plangently wistful, white-note stuff, in a familiar Copland/Bernstein/Sondheim vein - cf. the 'Somewhere' idyll in West Side Story, for a start - but eventually finding themselves singing along with the stalwart boy choristers (from St. Paul's, very good). The wistfully innocent Big Tune was stamped upon our ears by innumerable repetitions. Dissenting voices were rendered as mere sound and fury. I was embarrassed to find my old 1960s paranoias about the US (its well-meaning moral lust for world domination, its invincible ignorance about what moves anybody else) so starkly confirmed.</p>

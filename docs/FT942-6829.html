			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / South Africa aims to double arms exports South Africa hopes to double arms exports over the next year following the lifting of the United Nations arms embargo, which spurred previous governments to develop a sophisticated arms manufacturing industry. Mr Tielman de Waal, chief executive of Armscor, South Africa's arms procurement agency, said yesterday the company could boost defence exports by more than R1bn (Dollars 270m) in the current fiscal year. His statement comes against a background of calls for sharp cuts in the defence budget to fund new spending on social services under President Nelson Mandela's reconstruction and development programme. Armscor is keen to demonstrate the defence industry can generate as well as consume South Africa's scarce resources, and can earn foreign exchange from goods which are globally competitive. Armscor has come under increasing criticism since the new multi-racial government took over a fortnight ago, reflecting a new public awareness of moral arguments against arms exports. Mr de Waal noted, for example that South Africa sold a variety of weapons - rifles, grenades, mortars - worth R100m to Rwanda over a five-year period. He said the deal was terminated late last year because of evidence the weapons were used against the Rwandan people. In recent weeks, Rwandan Hutus loyal to the government have been blamed for horrific slaughters of minority Tutsis and other Hutus that killed tens of thousands of people. Mr Peet Smith, Armscor general manager for imports and exports, said the new government's policy permitted arms exports to countries only to defend their sovereignty and not where the weapons might be used to violate human rights. Despite anxieties about exports to the rest of Africa, South Africa's urgent need for foreign exchange earnings, coupled with a desire to capitalise on heavy spending on research and development during the apartheid era, will probably combine to protect Armscor's activities in future. Selling more of its respected military hardware is the key to Armscor's survival, Mr de Waal said. The company currently more than R800m of arms per year, which he said represented less than 0.5 per cent of the international arms market. Products that could sell well abroad include sophisticated Rooivalk helicopters, frequency-hopping radio transmitters and receivers that avoid interception, landmine-proof armoured vehicles, advanced mine detection equipment, and G-5 and G-6 long-range artillery. Mr de Waal identified Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Europe as potential markets. This will be eased by Tuesday's UN Security Council decision to lift a mandatory ban on the sale of arms to South Africa. President Mandela said this week Pretoria should be allowed to sell weapons if it wanted to and Defence Minister Joe Modise, a former guerrilla fighter, said expanding weapons exports could create 20,000 jobs.</p>

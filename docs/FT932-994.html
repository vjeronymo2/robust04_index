			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / UK Company News: SW Electricity advances 22% SOUTH WESTERN Electricity, the power supplier and distributor, said yesterday it had virtually ended the practice of disconnecting customers as it revealed a pre-tax profit of Pounds 101.1m, up 22 per cent on the previous Pounds 83m, and a 15 per cent dividend rise. Mr John Seed, chief executive, said that last month the company disconnected only one customer over bad debts. The dividend rise, taking the total from 17.4p to 20p with a final of 14.1p, was at the top of the range among regional electricity companies so far this year. It was paid from earnings of 63.1p (50.6p). The company is understood to have given its retail arm two years to perform satisfactorily. Unless it does, it is thought the company will seek to sell it, although Mr Seed would not confirm this. In the year to March 31 1993, the retailing arm incurred losses of Pounds 1.9m, against Pounds 400,000. Mr Seed said it had been helped by the integration of 23 stores in South Wales. He expected the division, to at least break even this year. In the core electricity businesses, the company achieved a 10 per cent reduction in controllable costs in two years. Staff had been reduced by that proportion to 3,192. The electricity business produced an operating profit of Pounds 103.9m, a rise of Pounds 10.2m. The supply business gained 14 large industrial customers outside the region in the competitive market to take its total to 17. COMMENT One effect of the disconnections progress was on bad debt provision, up from Pounds 3.9m to Pounds 6.6m in the core business. But that should fall as alternatives to controlling debt such as key budget meters take effect, and the company's softer approach will please both customers and the regulator. South Western's outstanding problem is retailing but that is par for the course at electricity groups, and at least it seems to be ready to take action if necessary. In the supply business, the company has less to lose than most when the market opens up next year to allow competition between companies for the custom of medium-sized industrial and commercial customers. Only 13 per cent of its customers are in that category whereas the average is 22 per cent. Conversely, South Western is more exposed than most to the rise in electricity prices which will result from the imposition of VAT; it has proportionally more domestic customers than the average. With profits of Pounds 115m and dividends of 22.5p in prospect for this year, the shares are trading on a prospective yield of about 6.1 per cent, about average and fair.</p>

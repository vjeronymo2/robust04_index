The NRC staff has prepared an Environmental Assessment of the proposed action. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Summary of Environmental Assessment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The ``Final Generic Environmental Impact Statement (FGEIS) on Handling and Storage of Spent Light Water Power Reactor Fuel'' (NUREG&hyph;0575), Volumes 1&hyph;3 (1979), concluded that the environmental impact of interim storage of spent fuel was negligible and the cost of the various alternatives reflects the advantage of continued generation of nuclear power with the accompanying spent fuel storage. Because of the differences in design, the FGEIS recommended evaluating spent fuel pool expansions on a case-by-case basis. For DAEC, the expansion of the storage capacity of the spent fuel pool will not create any significant additional radiological effects or nonradiological environmental impacts beyond those assessed in the Commission's Final Environmental Statement (FES) issued in March 1973 related to the operation of DAEC, and in the Safety Evaluation Report issued July 7, 1978, in support of a previous license amendment concerning storage capacity. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The occupational radiation dose for the proposed operation of the expanded spent fuel pool is estimated to be less than 2 percent of the total annual occupational radiation exposure for this facility. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Finding of No Significant Impact <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The staff has reviewed the proposed spent fuel pool expansion to the facility relative to the requirements set forth in 10 CFR part 51. Based on this assessment, the staff concludes that there are no significant radiological or nonradiological impacts associated with the proposed action and that the issuance of the proposed amendment to the license will have no significant impact on the quality of the human environment. Therefore, pursuant to 10 CFR 51.31, no environmental impact statement needs to be prepared for this action. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For further details with respect to this action see <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The application for amendment dated March 26, 1993, and supplemental correspondence dated September 15 and November 23, 1993, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The FGEIS on Handling and Storage of Spent Light Water Power Reactor Fuel (NUREG&hyph;0575), <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The FES for DAEC dated March 1973 and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The Environmental Assessment dated December 29, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These documents are available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555 and at the Cedar Rapids Public Library, 500 First Street, SE., Cedar Rapids, Iowa 52401. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 29th day of December 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Robert M.

			<p><P> March 21, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> LEADER OF BOSTON WINS LAWSUIT  </P> <P> Tom Scholz, leader of the rock group Boston, did not breach a contract with CBS  Records when the group failed to deliver a record album, a federal jury has  ruled.  </P> <P> Ending a seven-year court battle, the U.S. District Court jury also ruled  Tuesday that CBS Records did not engage in a conspiracy against Scholz when it  tried to stop other record companies from signing him.  </P> <P> CBS Records sued the entire band in 1983, charging it with failing to deliver  the requisite number of albums under a 1976 contract. Charges against other  band members were dismissed.  </P> <P> The band's first two albums, released in the 1970s, "Boston" and "Don't Look  Back," went platinum.  </P> <P> CBS expected a third album by 1981. Despite promises by Scholz to CBS  executives and rock magazines that the third album was imminent, no record was  made. CBS suspended Scholz's royalties in 1983, then sued.  </P> <P> Lawyers for both sides said the jury apparently believed Scholz's argument that  the delay in producing the third album was rooted in the creative process.  </P> <P> "I feel great," said Scholz, the group's founder. The jury "somehow picked up  that I didn't care about the money."  </P></p>

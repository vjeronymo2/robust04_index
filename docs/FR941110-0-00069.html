			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We recognize that protocols and guidelines are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary to promote consistent survey practice. However,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether or not a surveyor follows protocols must be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subordinate in importance to whether or not a facility meets  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal participation requirements. Violations must be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recognized and remedied appropriately if resident interests  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are to be protected and integrity is to remain in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enforcement system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter questioned whether proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;488.155(a)(3) conflicts with subpart III of Appendix P of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the State Operations Manual, Transmittal No. 250. Section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 488.155(a)(3) would require the State survey agency to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include in the standard survey an audit of written plans of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> care and residents' assessments. Subpart III states that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> review of the accuracy of resident assessments is to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performed as part of the extended survey which is triggered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by the identification of a deficiency in quality of care  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during the standard survey.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There is no conflict because a review of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comprehensive assessments and care plans is not limited to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the extended survey. It is also a major part of the Quality  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of Care Assessment performed during the standard survey (see  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Task 5 in Appendix P of State Operations Manual Transmittal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No. 250). The review that occurs during the extended survey  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is slightly different, though, in that surveyors are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> directed to review more recent care plan and assessment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information, and are given more flexibility in choosing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sample size than in the standard survey.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter suggested that we require  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surveyors to determine whether a facility attempted to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accommodate both the exercise of a resident's rights and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resident's health when there appears to be a conflict. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenter believed that accommodation should include  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exploration of care alternatives through a thorough care  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> planning process in which the resident may participate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Surveyors are presently instructed to make  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such determinations. At tag number F295 in the Interpretive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Guidance to Surveyors, the surveyor is directed to determine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether the care plan reflects the facility's efforts to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> find alternative means to address a problem if a resident  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has refused treatment. Additional guidance concerning this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> matter is found at tags F174 and F158. We believe such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific instructions are more appropriately located in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State Operations Manual than in the regulation itself, so  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> we are not incorporating them into the regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A few commenters suggested that we explicitly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mention a review of the quantity and quality of nursing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> services staff in &sect;488.305(a)(2) where we outline a survey  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the quality of care.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Inherent in an evaluation of the indicators  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of care and services listed at &sect;488.305(a)(2) is an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> examination of the quality of the staff providing them.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As part of the observational portion of the Quality of Care  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Assessment, surveyors are directed to make observations of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> staff/resident interactions which necessarily involve  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluating the quality of care and services provided by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> staff, which is an indication of the quality of the staff  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> itself. For this reason we do not explicitly mention this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessment in the regulation. We do specifically address a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> review of staffing in Appendix P of the State Operations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Manual Transmittal No. 250.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter recommended that we include, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> part of the standard survey, private meetings between  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surveyors and family groups during evening and or weekend  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hours and another conference at the conclusion of the survey  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process to explain survey findings in lay person language.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

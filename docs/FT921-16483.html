			<p>920103 FT  03 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Cowan EGM rejects five motions At a lively EGM yesterday, shareholders in Cowan de Groot, the toys and industrial hardware group, voted against five special resolutions brought by a shareholder which were described as 'inappropriate' by Cowan's directors, writes Michiyo Makamoto. The only resolution adopted was the change of the group's name to Glenchewton. The resolutions were proposed by Marlowe Holdings, which has a 15 per cent stake, and were directed at restricting Cowan's connections with Wilton Group, which has just under 70 per cent of the shares. One of the resolutions called for an amendment to the company's articles that would enable Marlowe to enjoy permanent representation on the board as long as it holds one share in the group.</p>

			<p><P> May 8, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLF ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> MUDD DEFEATS NELSON IN BYRON NELSON PLAYOFF  </P> <P> Jodie Mudd doesn't have the credentials of Larry Nelson, but it mattered little  when the golfers met in a sudden death playoff Sunday in the Byron Nelson  tournament at Dallas.  </P> <P> "You still have to play the shots, play the golf course," Mudd said after  beating Nelson on the first extra hole. "I figured I had a little bit of an  advantage, because of my length."  </P> <P> When Mudd and Nelson went to the first extra hole, the par-five 16th, with  $180,000 at stake, Nelson, 41, held a 3-1 playoff record, had won a U.S. Open  and carried a reputation as one of golf's fiercest competitors.  </P> <P> Mudd had an 0-2 playoff record and had one victory in an eight-year career.  </P> <P> He promptly scored a birdie-four with a 12-foot putt to win.  </P> <P> The playoff, the fourth in five years in the tournament, was set up when Mudd  and Nelson completed regulation play at 265, 15-strokes under par.  </P> <P> Mudd of Louisville, Ky., made up three shots over the last seven holes of  regulation play and gained the playoff with a five-under-par 65. Nelson shot a  67 for the final round.  </P> <P> Mudd drove the fairway. Nelson, drove into light rough.  </P> <P> Mudd hit a second shot just short of the green. Nelson laid up and had 115  yards left. His third was to the right and gave him a 30-foot putt.  </P> <P> Mudd chipped to 12 within feet, below the cup.  </P> <P> After Nelson missed his long putt, Mudd made his.  </P> <P> Mark O'Meara, a winner at Pebble Beach earlier this year, missed the playoff by  one stroke at 266. He had a closing 66.  </P> <P> Loren Roberts was next at 68 -- 267.  </P> <P> Larry Mize and Wayne Levi, who shared the lead at the start of the day's play,  "both had to struggle a bit," Mize said.  </P> <P> Each had a 71, and tied for fifth at 268 with Chris Perry, who shot 68.  </P> <P> Defending champion Juli Inkster overcame foul weather with a three-under-par 69  that pushed her past her faltering opponents for a five-stroke victory in the  LPGA's Crestar tournament at Chesapeake, Va.  </P> <P> Inkster built a three-shot advantage at the turn and never led by fewer than  two strokes the rest of the way on a rainy day that saw temperatures dip into  the upper 40s.  </P> <P> She completed three trips around Greenbrier Country Club's 6,275-yard layout in  210, six-under par.  </P> <P> The victory, worth $45,000 from the $300,000 purse, was Inkster's second of the  season and the 13th of her career.  </P> <P> Beth Daniel and Sweden's Liselotte Neumann were closest to Inkster at 215.  </P> <P> Larry Mowry birdied the final hole for a one-shot victory over Gay Brewer in a  $250,000 seniors PGA tournament at San Antonio, Tex.  </P> <P> Mowry's three-day total of 201 was 15 under par and set a tournament record. He  had rounds of 66, 67 and four-under 68. Brewer finished with a 202.  </P> <P> Miller Barber was third, three shots back at 204.  </P></p>

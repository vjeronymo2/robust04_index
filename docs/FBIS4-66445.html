			<p>CSO     [Text] Tokyo Electric Power Co., Ltd. (Tokyo Electric), has  developed a simple, convenient technology for converting the  ozone- layer-destroying specific freon into harmless substances  on the spot, wherever the freon was recovered from refrigerators  or automobile air-conditioners. In FY94, Tokyo Electric plans to  produce a test machine to do the conversion for performance  evaluation purposes. The technology is based on the photolysis  of freon by ultraviolet light from a mercury lamp and the  separation of unreacted freon from chlorine gas by a gas  separating membrane. Thus far, Tokyo Electric has been able to  demonstrate the treatment capacity of 50 g in eight hours for an  experimental device. The device will be scaled up with improved  efficiency in the test machine for future commercialization.  This device -- involving photolysis with ultraviolet light at  normal temperature and under normal pressure -- is so simple and  convenient with its on-the-spot conversion of freon from  refrigerators and automobile air-conditions that it is expected  to be implemented soon.    One of the specified types of freon, CFC12, is the coolant  that is almost exclusively used for refrigerators and auto  air-conditioners. In all likelihood, requirements in the near  future will specify that CFC12 must be recovered from these  cooling devices prior to their disposal and must be converted  into safe substances at places where used refrigerators are  collected and at automobile factories.    The basic segment of the new, UV-light-using  freon-decomposition device, developed jointly by Tokyo Electric  and Kansai New Technology Research Institute, consists simply of  ultraviolet lamps and a gas separation membrane. Noting that the  chlorine atoms of freon are detached by ultraviolet rays in the  stratosphere, the joint team devised a device that separates  chlorine atoms from freon by irradiating ultraviolet rays in a  reaction vessel and that recovers chlorine gas by means of the  gas separation membrane. Ultraviolet rays sever the  carbon-chlorine bonds in a freon molecule. Carbon and fluorine,  which remain combined, are recovered as powdery fluoro-polymers.    Thus far, the joint team has been able to confirm the  decomposition of five different types of specified freon and has  demonstrated that any freon mixture with lubricating oil can be  handled by the device, if the oil can be separated from freon by  taking advantage of the difference in the boiling points prior  to the photolytic decomposition. Today, the device, which uses  two 32-watt low-pressure mercury lamps, can be continuously  operated to process 50 g of freon in eight hours.    The basic technology of the device has been essentially  proven to be satisfactory, and the prospect is bright for  increasing the processing capacity by combining a number of  reactors. Tokyo Electric plans to build a pilot model with  improved capacity through modifications that include improving  the efficiency of ultraviolet-ray utilization by surrounding the  reactor with reflective boards. The model is expected to be  tested for its performances by the end of FY94 prior to  production of a commercial-scale device. In 1992, Tokyo  Electric, in cooperation with the Agency of Industrial Science  and Technology, had developed a mass concentration-type device  that could decompose freon with 10,000C heat from a plasma  torch. However, the new, more compact device, with smaller  capacity, is expected to be commercialized soon because it can  be conveniently handled right at the places of recovery for used  refrigerators and car air-conditioners.    The joint team has thus far spent only approximately &yen;40  million for the development of this device, which has such  bright prospects for commercialization, by taking full advantage  of computer chemistry for clarifying the reaction mechanisms.</p>

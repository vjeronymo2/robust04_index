			<p>BFN     [Text] To respect the Haitian people is to be careful not  to impose on them what they previously rejected. This is a  statement by President Jean-Bertrand Aristide who asks the  Clinton government to respect the wishes of the Haitian people.  What over 67 percent of the Haitian people are demanding today  is a total embargo and the return of their president, stated  Aristide who pointed out that this decision of the people is  supported by Canada, France, and Venezuela.    [Begin Aristide recording] I think Canada, France, and  Venezuela have done much to support, for instance, our call for  the application of a total embargo. I have not seen this on the  part of the United States. I simply wish the United States would  exhibit a coherent policy, consisting of listening to and  respecting the voice of the Haitian people, through respect for  the results of those elections. Today, over 67 percent are  demanding the return of the president; and a total embargo, but  not the kind of embargo that is a source of suffering. To  respect the Haitian people is to agree not to impose what they  have rejected. We have rejected this kind of embargo by  requesting a total embargo. May the desires of the Haitian  people be respected. [end recording]    That was President Jean-Bertrand Aristide asking that the  Haitian people's wishes, expressed through the 16 December 1990  elections, be respected.</p>

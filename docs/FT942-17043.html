			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Jump in women workers forecast Women workers will make up 46 per cent of Britain's labour force by 2006 according to the latest Department of Employment projections published in its journal Employment Gazette. This is 2 percentage points more than the current figure and contrasts with the latest official figure for women as a proportion of workers in employment - about 49 per cent (10.5m) last December. By 2006 the size of the labour force is expected to rise to 29.4m, 1.5m more than in mid 1993. As many as 1.3m of the projected additional workers will be women. At present women constitute 44 per cent of the labour force. Britain will also have an older labour force. There will be a 2.4m projected rise among the 35 to 54 age group and 700,000 people aged 55 and over. By contrast, a fall of 1.6m people is predicted over the same period for the under-35 labour force. Employment Gazette, April. HMSO. Pounds 4.95.</p>

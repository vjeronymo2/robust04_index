			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksey Kuznetsov] </F>   [Text] Delhi, 16 May -- "I regard India as Russia's most  valuable partner in arms trade," Viktor Samoylov, director  general of Rosvooruzheniye, the state company for exports and  imports of arms and military hardware, said in an ITAR-TASS  interview. Today he arrived on a working visit in India to take  part in talks with the leadership of the republic's Defense  Ministry and the commanders in chief of the Army, the Air Force,  and the Navy.    The schedule of his week-long stay also includes visits to  the wharfs in Bombay and Goa, where patrol combat ships are  being built for the Indian Navy with Russian assistance. He is  to assess in detail the progress in implementing a number of  programs connected with production under licence in India. The  head of the state company also intends, in his own words, to  contribute to "speeding up the Indian sides' proposals  concerning the purchase of special equipment in Russia."    India is an attractive trade partner for us for many  reasons,  V. Samoylov said. We have been cooperating for a long time, and  the Indian side "has always paid its bills and has often placed  major orders in Russia, expressing interest not only in  ready-made products but also in new technologies. Our  partnership is equal and mutually beneficial. The main  indicator of our relations is stability, which allows the  Russian Federation industrial complex to feel serious support."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 12 KYODO -- New Party Sakigake  [Harbinger] leader Masayoshi Takemura on Thursday [12 May]  backed a call from the Social Democratic Party (SDP) for the  next general election to be held under the current multiseat  constituency system, Sakigake officials said.    "It is a reasonable idea," Takemura was quoted as saying of  the proposal in a meeting with SDP chairman Tomiichi Murayama.    Both Sakigake and the SDP quit the ruling coalition last  month, leaving the cabinet of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata to be  a minority government. Sakigake has offered cooperation for the  Hata cabinet without occupying any post in it, while the SDP has  declared it is an opposition party.    Murayama urged Hata on Wednesday to dissolve the House of  Representatives and call a snap general election under the  current election system. Murayama told the Sakigake leader that  the premier's authority to dissolve the lower house should not  be restricted just because the Diet has not yet passed a bill  for redistributing multiple-seat constituencies into single-seat  electoral districts, the officials said.    The Diet in January passed the new electoral system revision  bill to replace the multiseat system with a mix of 300 single  seats and 200 seats under proportional representation. But a  separate bill has to be passed to reorganize the single-seat  constituencies before an election can be held under the new  system.    The meeting between Takemura and Murayama took place in the  SDP headquarters. They also met Wednesday at the Sakigake  headquarters.    The two leaders also agreed to initiate talks aimed at  reconciling their policy and ideological differences as a  prerequisite for cementing their solidarity and parliamentary  tactical collaboration, the officials said.    One of the key differences is over the Japan-U.S. Security  Treaty, opposed by some SDP members but supported by Sakigake,  which was set up by a breakaway group of Liberal Democratic  Party (LDP) legislators.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev [no date as received] -- An agreement setting  up a joint Ukrainian-Korean commission for trade and economic  cooperation was signed on 8 June at the Ministry of Foreign  Economic Relations. It was signed by Petro Kaban, deputy  minister of foreign economic relations for the Ukrainian side,  and Han Su-kil, deputy chairman of the Commission for External  Economic Affairs of the DPRK.    Kaban said the agreement would promote trade and economic  cooperation between the two countries on the same scale as when  Ukraine was in the Soviet Union. Deputy Minister of Industry  Hryhoriy Osaulenko has been nominated to head the Ukrainian  staff at the commission who are to be approved by the Cabinet of  Ministers.    Han Su-kil said that the DPRK was mainly interested in  importing equipment from Ukraine for its mines, generators, and  rolled metal plates, and in Ukraine's assistance in the  development of oil fields and oil extraction.    Anatoliy Kolos, Ukraine's deputy minister of foreign  economic  relations said Ukraine had already set up such joint commissions  with Poland, Hungary, Vietnam, Mongolia, China, and other  countries. An agreement with the DPRK pointed to renewal of  Ukraine-North Korean economic relations. Kolos added that  Ukraine had the resources to develop oil fields in the DPRK.  Negotiations at this stage concern the method of payment for  Ukrainian services, whether it will be made in hard currency or  on terms of barter supplies.    The joint Ukrainian-Korean commission for trade and economic  cooperation is provisionally planning to hold its first meeting  in September in Pyongyang.</p>

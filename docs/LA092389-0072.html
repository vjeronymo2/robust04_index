			<p><P> September 23, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 'HILLSIDE STRANGLER' BIANCHI GETS MARRIED  </P> <P> Kenneth Bianchi, one of the two Hillside Stranglers who terrorized Los Angeles  in the late 1970s, has married his Louisiana pen pal after meeting her for the  first time this week, prison officials said Friday in Walla Walla, Wash.  </P> <P> Bianchi, 38, wore a black tuxedo and Shirlee Joyce Book, 36, of Monterey, La.,  wore a white wedding dress with a small veil during the 15-minute ceremony in  the prison chapel Thursday morning, Washington State Penitentiary spokesman  Richard Bauer said.  </P> <P> Bauer said it was the first marriage for Bianchi, who is serving a life term in  prison for killing two Bellingham, Wash., women.  </P> <P> Bianchi also pleaded guilty to the murders of five young women in Southern  California and was a key witness against his adoptive cousin, Angelo Buono, who  was convicted in nine of the 1977 and 1978 sex-and-strangulation slayings.  </P> <P> The killings were attributed to the Hillside Strangler because many of the  victims' bodies were found on hillsides in Los Angeles and Glendale. The  killings were the subject of a TV movie this year.  </P> <P> Bianchi, who claims to be a born-again Christian, started corresponding with  Book in 1986 and had talked to her by telephone, but met her for the first time  Wednesday, Bauer said.  </P></p>

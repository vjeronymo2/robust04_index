In his year-end news conference, Lien said upgrading sports  facilities islandwide is one of the 12 major tasks the  government will promote in the new year.    Better sports facilities, including hardware and software,  will help Taiwan win its bid to host international sports  activities, such as the Asian Games and the East Asian Games,  Lien said.    An interministerial task force to help win sponsorship of  the  2000 Asian Games and the 1999 East Asian Games was formally  established Friday by the Executive Yuan.    The task force, in its first meeting Friday chaired by Vice  Premier Hsu Li-teh, agreed to decide which city will host the  games by March 31 and file the application to the Asian Olympics  Committee by June 20.    The meeting also decided that athletes and sports staff from  Mainland China, whether they are Chinese Communist Party members  or not, need not report their exit and entry during the games.    And issues concerning national anthems and team flags will  be  handled according to Asian Olympics and international Olympics  regulations, the task force said.    So far, both the capital city Taipei in the north and  seaport  city Kaohsiung in southern Taiwan have expressed strong desires  to host the games.</p>

			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / Smith promotes leftwingers to front bench MR JOHN SMITH, the Labour leader, yesterday moved to encourage party unity by including several prominent leftwingers in his frontbench team. The 76-strong list - only marginally shorter than the outgoing team - took in Ms Clare Short, Mr Tony Banks and Ms Maria Fyfe, all of whom resigned under Mr Neil Kinnock's parliamentary leadership in opposition to Labour's stance on the Gulf war. The Smith front bench also includes well-known rightwingers such as Mr Stuart Bell at trade and industry, underlining that the leader has ignored political labels and made his selections on merit. 'What is quite clear is that, with 91 per cent of the vote for the leadership, John Smith feels free to choose his team on the basis of performance, not ideology,' an official said. 'People will keep their jobs or lose them on how they perform and nothing else.' Also given jobs were eight new faces, among them Mr Keith Vaz, the Leicester East MP who has gained prominence as a vigorous campaigner for depositors and staff of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International. Mr Clive Soley, formerly the party's housing spokesman, has returned to the back benches, reportedly at his own request, as has Mr Mark Fisher, until now arts spokesman. Among the most obvious promotions are a newly prominent role for Mr Alistair Darling, MP for Edinburgh Central, who moves from home affairs to the Treasury team, and for Mr Derek Fatchett, MP for Leeds Central, who appears set to take on City affairs from Ms Marjorie Mowlam. Ms Mowlam, newly elected to the shadow cabinet with responsibility for the Citizen's Charter and women, appears one of the main beneficiaries of the changes with a back-up team of Mr Brian Wilson, Mr Lewis Moonie and Ms Kate Hoey. The European portfolio - the number two job in Mr Jack Cunningham's shadow foreign affairs group - stays with Mr George Robertson, who has held the job since 1983. But Mr Martin O'Neill, the former defence spokesman, now moves to energy in Mr Robin Cook's trade and industry team. Mr Tom Pendry replaces the veteran Mr Denis Howell as shadow spokesman for sport. Other treasury spokesmen under the leadership of the shadow chancellor, Mr Gordon Brown, are Mr Andrew Smith and Mr Nick Brown. Mr Paul Boateng has been shifted sideways to the team shadowing the Lord Chancellor's Department. Mr Cook's trade and industry team includes Mr Nigel Griffiths and Mr Jim Cousins, a newcomer to the front bench.</p>

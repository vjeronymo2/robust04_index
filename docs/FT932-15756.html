			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Council contracts out roads BERKSHIRE County Council has awarded one of the largest local government contracts to the Babtie Group, the Glasgow-based consulting engineers, to manage its highway and planning services. Babtie will receive more than Pounds 30m over four years to handle the council's traffic and road safety services, highway maintenance and waste management. The council said it was the first local authority to hand over its highways and planning services to a private-sector contractor. Mr Tony Allen, the council's chief executive, said: 'The government is planning to extend compulsory competitive tendering to highways and planning services in the very near future and we feel we have given our highways and planning staff a more secure future by getting in first and being in control of the situation.' He said the council expected the contract to mean savings of Pounds 1.3m in 1993-94 and increased amounts after that. Babtie will assume responsibility for traffic monitoring, traffic signals, bus schemes and highway and bridge maintenance. It will be responsible for road safety strategy and accident prevention and investigation. It will also take over waste recycling, landfill design, pollution control and monitoring, and preparation of waste disposal contracts. Of the council's 383 highway and planning staff, 309 will become Babtie employees. Twenty will continue to work for the council, managing the contract. There will be 14 compulsory redundancies and 14 temporary staff will leave. Twenty-six are taking voluntary redundancy, the council said.</p>

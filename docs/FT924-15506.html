			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / So far so good in Angolan election: International supervision has created a climate of reconciliation which will now be put to the test PRESIDENT Jose Eduardo Dos Santos was still narrowly leading his opponent, Mr Jonas Savimbi, leader of the rebel Unita movement, as counting continued last night in Angola's first free elections. The war-shattered country is in the midst of a 16-month historic transition from civil war to peace and democracy. The critical moment comes in the next 48 hours, when one of the warring sides must accept defeat. International observers, who are satisfied the polling was free and fair, say the success of the transition has left little room for either side to manoeuvre. Observers yesterday poured praise on the civic responsibility, tolerance and self-restraint exercised by Angolans during polling, and on the professionalism of the National Electoral Commission. But the international community also deserves credit for helping to fund the process and create a climate of confidence and national reconciliation in a society deeply scarred by civil war. The international role in Angola's peace process, costing about Dollars 250m (Pounds 140m), is certain to provide lessons for transitions in other war-ravaged African countries such as Mozambique, where talks on a ceasefire agreement were continuing in Rome yesterday. Even six months ago few observers believed the process could stay on track and get as far as the elections. The formidable obstacles included deep suspicion and hostility between the MPLA government and Unita, the many weapons in the country, and the logistical constraints of working in a country the size of France, Spain and Germany combined, which has never before held elections and where the infrastructure is in ruins. The critical input by the United Nations and the international community has been to create confidence for both sides and for the people of Angola and to provide an impartial and objective authority to resolve disputes. 'At some time we've been accused of being pro-MPLA by Unita and pro-Unita by the MPLA, so we must have been getting it right,' says Miss Margaret Anstee, the special representative of the UN secretary general and the head of the Dollars 120m UN operation known as Unavem II. 'The process has stayed on track despite several violent incidents which could have blown up.' Critics have said the UN operation was vastly underfunded and under-resourced, especially compared to the transition in Namibia. But Miss Anstee says the UN mandate in Namibia was to organise and control the peace process and elections, whereas in Angola the mandate was merely to observe the process being undertaken by both sides. The greatest problem has been logistics such as air transport, vehicles and communications. 'Anstee pushed very hard and very successfully from the beginning for bilateral support for logistics and it is hard to see how things would have gone any better with more money,' said a western diplomat. The UN-monitored peace process has had two basic elements - political and military. On the political front, the voter registration campaign was successful, registering 4.86m voters out of a population of about 10.5m. Although an estimated 300,000-400,000 voters were not registered, observers agree the exercise exceeded expectations. The second vital part of the peace process was observing the elections themselves. The UN provided 400 observers and assisted in an internationally-funded Dollars 10m airlift operation which flew 25,000 people in 320 flights from remote areas to polling stations. On the military side, 350 UN military observers have monitored the ceasefire and supervised the confinement of troops to assembly areas, the collection and disposal of weapons and the demobilisation of 150,000 troops, which was supposed to be completed before the elections. Demobilisation went much slower than expected, with only about two thirds of the 150,000 ex-soldiers demobilised so far. Part of the problem has been that both sides, but especially Unita, have kept back troops and the best weapons as an insurance policy in case the process was derailed. The second strand of the military process has been forging a new 50,000-strong unified army, navy and air force out of Unita and the MPLA. This is being assisted by Britain, Portugal and France. Last Monday, the new joint military high command of the new army was sworn in at a ceremony in Luanda and at least 8,800 troops have undergone western-supervised training courses in new military academies. The British have spent Pounds 1.7m on practical support such as mine clearance, signals equipment, refurbishment of a barracks at Uige and technical advice on logistics, maintenance and restructuring the Ministry of Defence. Both the demobilisation and the formation of a new army have fallen short of the ambitious targets set in the peace accords, but almost all observers say what has been achieved, given the logistical and political constraints, has been remarkable. The risks of the process falling apart now rest on the reaction of both parties to the election result within the next two days. But the success of the efforts of the international community in getting this far has contributed to providing Angola with a climate for reconciliation.</p>

			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Carsberg to quit early as fair trading head Sir Bryan Carsberg, Britain's senior competition regulator, is to step down as director-general of fair trading next May, three years into his five-year term. Sir Bryan, a former accountancy professor, is quitting the Office of Fair Trading to become secretary-general of the IASC - the international financial reporting organisation. Although his decision will cause some embarrassment to the government it has not come as a surprise. Sir Bryan is known to be frustrated by his role at the OFT as the government has watered down competition policy in favour of promoting industry. As director-general of telecommunications from 1984 to 1992, Sir Bryan was the UK's first privatised utilities regulator, and when he moved to the OFT it was widely expected he would expand the role. Observers thought he would eventually take full responsibility for regulation and oversee other utility watchdogs. However, his appointment to the OFT coincided with that of Mr Michael Heseltine as trade and industry secretary and with the change of government policy on competition. Sir Bryan, who is on a two-day business trip to Paris, was unavailable for comment last night, but an OFT official denied that there was any rift between him and Mr Heseltine. 'It is a question of him wanting to go to something rather an escape from something,' he said. Ironically, the announcement of his departure comes when the OFT is much busier than it has been for several months, vetting both the British Aerospace and GEC bids for VSEL, the submarine builder, and the proposed merger between the Leeds and Halifax building societies. Sir Bryan moves to the IASC for an initial five-year term, but his contract is renewable. The appointment delighted the accounting body, which draws up model financial reporting standards. Sir Bryan said in a statement issued yesterday by the IASC: 'The move towards more competitive global capital markets and the continuing progress of multinational companies create a strong need for common accounting rules which can be applied in all countries and which will be accepted by all stock exchanges.' Mr Eiichi Shiratori, chairman of the IASC, said: 'I am very pleased that the IASC has been able to attract such a well qualified person as its secretary-general at such an important time in its development.' The IASC is playing an increasing role in regulating accounting standards at a time when the growth in international trading is giving it influence in bringing together national regulators.

			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Church withholds Pounds 1m aid for cities THE CHURCH Commissioners have been forced by recessionary pressures to withhold a Pounds 1m grant that was to have been made to the Church of England's inner-cities charity, and to tell churchgoers they must contribute more to clergy stipends. The commissioners, who handle the church's main investments, saw investment income grow by only 1 per cent to Pounds 167m last year. They expect little further growth in the near future, while costs are predicted to rise substantially, and speak in their annual report yesterday of a 'period of sharp adjustment' ahead. The charity, the Church Urban Fund, was set up in 1988 as a main recommendation of Faith in the City, the church's influential report on urban troubles. Its initial target was to raise Pounds 18m from churchgoers in the dioceses and Pounds 5m from industry, with the commissioners contributing a regular Pounds 1m a year. Successful early fund-raising has made the fund one of Britain's 50 largest charities. But the commissioners say they were unable to give their Pounds 1m grant last year 'in the light of the difficult economic outlook'. The announcement of the decision comes a week after a lecture in which the archbishop of Canterbury, Dr George Carey, spoke of the importance of charities in a 'society suffering from shallow materialism and spiritual bewilderment'. The commissioners still provide administrative support for the fund. Financial pressures, the commissioners say, mean they will have to fund a smaller proportion of clergy stipends in future. Providing pensions for the clergy and contributing to their pay consumes 85 per cent of the commissioners' investment income. Last year's Church of England pay bill was Pounds 145m, of which the commissioners met 45 per cent. The commissioners say their support might drop to about 30 per cent by 1995. Since the recession is affecting the investments of individual dioceses as much as the commissioners' funds, the report recognises that the only solution will be for churchgoers to increase their giving. A typical church member contributes about Pounds 3 a week. The commissioners acknowledge that their property investments - a third of total holdings last year - have been proportionately much larger than those of most financial institutions. They say that served the church well in the 1980s, but that property investment has now been affected by stagnant or falling rents.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 8. Merger/Conversions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In some cases mutual institutions convert to stock ownership simultaneously with a merger or acquisition transaction with another depository institution or holding company. This is generally known as a merger/conversion. In merger/conversions depositors of the converting institutions obtain the right to purchase stock in the acquiring institution and not the converting savings bank. In exercising its fiduciary responsibilities the board of directors/trustees of a mutual State Savings Bank must assure that:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The value of the converting institution is fairly determined; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) That value is distributed to the proper constituents of the bank.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As indicated in the Proposed Rule, based on the proposed conversions the FDIC has reviewed in the recent past and other merger conversions it has studied, the Board has observed that, in virtually every merger conversion, the acquiring institution has captured a large portion of the value of the converting institution. It has not been uncommon in merger/conversions for the management of the converting mutual institution to receive extremely generous compensation and benefit packages. Thus, an apparent conflict of interest exists: whether the management of a mutual institution is opting for a merger/conversion, instead of a standard conversion or no conversion at all, based on the best interests of the institution and its depositors or in response to the level of benefits offered to management by the acquiring entity. As noted in the preamble to the Interim Rule and in the Proposed Rule, there have been numerous complaints by depositors and others that permitting healthy mutual savings banks to be acquired by means of a merger/conversion has resulted in some savings bank insiders putting their interests ahead of the interests of the converting bank and its constituents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the Proposed Rule, the FDIC requested specific comment on this topic and specifically whether a moratorium should be placed on merger/conversions involving sufficiently capitalized State Savings Banks. Most of those who commented on the issue said the FDIC should not prohibit merger/conversions and that the FDIC should review such proposed transactions on a case-by-case basis. A bank holding company commented that merger/conversions are desirable because they increase competition in the industry and support safety and soundness. It noted that state law is the ``proper authority'' to regulate management compensation issues in merger/conversions. A state banking and thrift regulator suggested that the FDIC and OTS collaborate in a joint determination on whether merger/conversions will be approved in the future and, if so, adopt specific requirements to provide parity among savings associations and savings banks. A state banking and thrift industry trade group recommended that merger/conversions be permitted only in the case of undercapitalized institutions or at the discretion of the regulators on a case-by-case basis. A law firm commented that the FDIC should publish the criteria that it intends to use in evaluating proposals. Another suggested that the OTS and the FDIC take the same approach to merger/conversions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Others expressed general opposition to merger/conversions. A national consumer group said merger/conversions should be prohibited. An individual commented that merger/conversions should not be allowed because they ``only serve management's interests and not the depositors''. He suggested that any merger take place only after an initial ``free-standing'' standard conversion. A national banking and thrift industry trade group said it would not oppose a ``regulatory pause by the FDIC to evaluate its rules governing merger/conversions''.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Upon consideration of the comments and based on the factors discussed above, the Board continues to believe that merger/conversions should, in most cases, be permitted only in situations where a State Savings Bank is ``undercapitalized'' ``significantly undercapitalized'' or ``critically undercapitalized'', as defined in the FDIC's capital maintenance regulations. The Board still believes, however, that it is unnecessary at this time to impose a blanket prohibition on non-supervisory merger/conversions. Such merger/conversions may be considered in situations where the value of a State Savings Bank is determined in a fair manner and that value is delivered to the rightful recipients, as determined by the directors/trustees of the bank in the proper exercise of their fiduciary responsibilities under the applicable state law. In no instance will an acquiring institution be considered a rightful recipient.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to comments requesting that the FDIC specify, in its mutual-to-stock conversion regulations, the terms and conditions of a merger/conversion that would be acceptable to the FDIC, the FDIC notes only the general criteria that: (1) The value of the converting institution be fairly determined, and (2) the value be proposed to be distributed to the proper constituents of the bank. Industry innovation is encouraged in this regard. State law factors also are an important consideration. As noted above, because historically merger/conversions have been a source of considerable insider abuse, the FDIC will continue to closely scrutinize such proposed transactions, particularly for potential breaches of fiduciary duty.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Owing to the same historical concerns in this area, the OTS Revisions continue to prohibit non-supervisory merger/conversions. In response to the comment that the FDIC and the OTS adopt similar regulations on merger/conversions, the FDIC notes that, in its conversion regulations, the OTS retains its general waiver authority to permit a merger/conversion under the appropriate circumstances. Thus, the OTS approach (that it would not prohibit a non-supervisory merger/conversion in certain circumstances) is consistent with the FDIC's approach of considering merger/conversions on a case-by-case basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 9. Convenience and Needs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As specified in the Interim Final Rule, one of the factors the FDIC currently considers in reviewing proposed conversions of State Savings Banks is ``the extent of any existing and planned contributions to or investments in the community''. In the Proposed Rule, the Board requested specific comment on whether the FDIC could and should consider imposing a convenience-and-needs requirement in connection with the mutual-to-stock conversions of State Savings Banks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FDIC received eight comments on this issue. Generally, they were evenly divided. Some argued that a convenience-and-needs requirement should not be imposed because a conversion involves only a financial recapitalization and not a change in services. Others said they favored such a requirement. Two comments that opposed the proposal questioned the FDIC's legal authority to impose such a requirement. They also noted that the FDIC has ample opportunity to review a savings bank's CRA performance in the context of a post-conversion CRA evaluation. One commenter suggested that it was a legislative, not a regulatory, matter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

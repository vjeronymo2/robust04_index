			<p><P> June 29, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P>  YOUR BOOKSHELF: OVERCOMING YOUR CHILDHOOD  </P> <P> Being Your Own Parent: The Solution for Adult Children of Alcoholic and Other  Dysfunctional Families by Dennis Wholey (Doubleday: $17.95).  </P> <P> Dennis Wholey, former host of PBS-TV's "LateNight America," left his job to  write "The Courage to Change," a book about his own alcoholic background. Now,  in "Being Your Own Parent," Wholey examines the lives of 14 people whose  addictions include alcoholism, overeating, gambling, the abuse of prescriptions  or illegal drugs. Then there are other problems, including emotional  abandonment.  </P> <P> Variously angry, suppressed, embittered and generally haunted by ghosts from  the past, they discuss their problems at meetings of Adult Children of  Alcoholics, an organization found in many cities across the nation. Run along  the lines of Alcoholics Anonymous, these talk-it-out groups promise anonymity  and support.  </P> <P> Wholey also has gathered brief, intelligent essays by experts on dysfunctional  behavior. Though much of what is written here might seem familiar to those in  the field of psychotherapy, Wholey has made a useful contribution by  summarizing personal truths. At bottom, he writes: "We all feel the urgent need  to love and be loved." And, "we've all been affected by the past, but none of  us need to be a victim of it." ROSELLE M. LEWIS  </P></p>

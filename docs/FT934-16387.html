			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses rise in response to interest rate theory THE BULL argument for European equities was put yesterday by Mr Anthony Thomas, of Kleinwort Benson: 'Our strategy is unashamedly unsophisticated: we see interest rates triggering a shift out of cash and into equities.' Bourses backed the argument up, writes Our Markets Staff, particularly in Germany where the yield on five-year notes, or Bundesobligationen, was reduced by six basis points to 5.55 per cent. FRANKFURT rose by 2.6 per cent to a new all-time closing high, the DAX index ending 49.01 higher at 1,972.73. Traders said that investment funds had chosen not to roll over call money investments from the third into the fourth quarter because of current low short-term interest rates. Turnover more than doubled from DM5.25bn to DM10.8bn. Apart from the interest rate argument, said Ms Barbara Altmann at B Metzler, DTB traders caught short by Mr Yeltsin's victory in Moscow were said to be covering their positions in the cash market. Allianz, which weighs in at over 12 per cent of the DAX, rose by DM127, or 4.9 per cent to DM2,708. Daimler took its place on the New York stock exchange with the underlying shares up DM14 to DM760, still a below average gain on the day. Above average performers included Degussa, the metals and chemicals group, disposing of a lossmaking subsidiary and climbing DM25, or 6.7 per cent to DM385.50; and Kaufhof, the retailer, planning to list ADRs on Wall Street and rising DM32.50 to DM560 on the excitement of it all. PARIS was optimistic about benchmark interest rates, and decided that the bargain price for the BNP privatisation was a bull point. The CAC 40 index rose 30.11, or 1.4 per cent to 2,158.77 and Rhone Poulenc, depressed by the BNP pricing on Monday, recovered FFr3.50 to FFr156.50. US investors were reported to be snapping up companies such as LVMH and Club Med, which have strong interests in North America and rose by FFr172 to FFr3,880, and by FFr16 to FFr392 respectively. However, Schneider, the electrical equipment and construction group, dropped first on plans to raise FFr3bn, and secondly on a report that the company's chairman, Mr Didier Pineau-Valencienne, faces a legal investigation in Belgium. It closed FFr28 lower at FFr358. MILAN continued to be driven by the Fiat rally and the Comit index added 5.95 to 596.47. Mr John Stewart, of InterEuropa in Milan, noted that Fiat's share price had picked up by 10.4 per cent since last Wednesday's sell-off as the market reassessed its rights issue, and the terms of the sale of its Rinascente stake. Fiat rose another L100 to L6,180. Rinascente was L102 higher at L9,920. Ifil, the Agnelli holding company, picked up L61 to L5,866, recouping some of Monday's sharp losses, as it sought to reassure analysts by forecasting that 1993 pretax profit would rise to L315bn from last year's L198bn. Fondiaria gained L700 or 5.4 per cent to L13,500 on short covering ahead of its rights issue. ZURICH took its lead from a higher Frankfurt and the SMI index overcame recent hesitancy to push convincingly through the 2,500 level. The index finished 31.0 or 1.2 per cent higher at a record 2,521.3. Insurers were supported by recent profits figures and investors beginning to adjust portfolios to match the SMI index which will weight the sector more heavily from next year. Swiss Re was SFr100 higher at SFr3,480 and Winterthur advanced SFr23 to SFr748. Swissair posted a further SFr28 rise to SFr718 amid continued speculation about the outlook for the Alcazar alliance. AMSTERDAM found early support from the options market and pushed higher after Wall Street opened firmly with a further round of investment buying. The CBS Tendency index rose 1.2 to 126.9. Financials were in demand with ABN-Amro Fl 1 up at Fl 46.40 and Ing, recommended by Goldman Sachs as 'one of the most attractive European financial shares. . .',adding Fl 1.70 to Fl 75.70. STOCKHOLM's Affarsvarlden General index rose 26.7 to 1,325.74, and HELSINKI's Hex put on 35.03, or 2.5 per cent at 1,325.74. Headlines included a SKr7 rise to an all-time high of SKr444 in Ericsson B, and Nokia's further FM21 gain to FM283 after a chart topping performance this year.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- October 5                                           THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes               Open       11.30       12.00      13.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100       1311.90     1311.40     1311.04    1310.66 FT-SE Eurotrack 200       1391.08     1390.36     1389.33    1389.13  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes              14.00       15.00       16.00      Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100       1310.31     1313.00     1313.86    1313.91 FT-SE Eurotrack 200       1389.57     1391.49     1392.20    1391.47  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         Oct 4     Oct 1    Sep 30    Sep 29    Sep 28  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1299.14   1293.99   1293.02   1288.31   1288.96 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1377.73   1368.19   1362.51   1356.79   1364.11  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- High/day: 100 - 1314.62; 200 - 1392.24 Low/day: 100 - 1310.11 200 - 1387.81  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

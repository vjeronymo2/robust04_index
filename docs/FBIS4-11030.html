			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Buenos Aires, 19 Apr (NA) -- Central Bank  President Roque Fernandez today said the interest rate increase  in the United States is going to cause an increase in the local  interest rates on deposits, and he believes that during the rest  of the year there will be "ups and downs in the markets as a  result of the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy."    The banker indicated that the increase in the U.S. interest  rate is going to cause an increase in the interest rates on  deposits, and "this is an incentive to save, something that is  not bad."    "It is bad when the active rates on loans increase," he  said,  and explained that monetary authorities are studying "how this  incentive on the passive rate will favor savings."    The measure the Central Bank has under study is a decrease  in  the spread [preceding word in English], in other words, banking  costs, "so the active interest rate will remain where it is."

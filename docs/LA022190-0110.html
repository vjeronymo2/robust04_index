			<p><P> February 21, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KING COACH COULD RETURN IN 3 WEEKS  </P> <P> King Coach Tom Webster underwent successful inner-ear surgery Tuesday at St.  Vincent's Hospital in Los Angeles and could be back with the team in less than  three weeks.  </P> <P> Dr. James Sheehy discovered a leak of inner-ear fluid, an injury similar to one  Webster suffered several years ago.  </P> <P> The new injury was caused when Webster, 40, fell while showering in his  Edmonton hotel room Jan. 26.  </P> <P> Webster was forced to resign as coach of the New York Rangers in January of  1987 when the original inner-ear problem prevented him from flying. Surgery  repaired that injury.  </P> <P> Webster's condition was originally diagnosed as a concussion, but dizziness  continued. Sheehy found the new injury in the same area as the old.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Tadeusz Jastrzebski: "Single-Digit Inflation?"] </F>   [Text] Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz, Polish National Bank  chairman, said recently that inflation in Poland could be  reduced to single-digit values within three to four years. In  turn, Miroslaw Pietrewicz, head of the Central Planning  Administration, estimated in his forecast for the next few years  that, by 1997, inflation could amount to 12 percent.    If we remember that, in 1989, inflation reached more than  500  percent and that last year it still amounted to almost 40  percent, a realistic expectation of 10-percent inflation must be  seen as excellent progress. Here, however, we come to the  question of the true feasibility of such a result.    This year, inflation should reach some 26 percent. The  beginning of the year was very good: In January and February,  prices went up by a little over 1 percent (each month, of  course). However, the March figures were only half as good,  with price hikes of 2.6 percent. It is too early to say  anything with certainty about April, but it seems that, if the  results are only half as good as in March, they will be good  enough in the circumstances. Inflation depends on many other  things in addition to wage increases, but that factor has still  to be taken seriously into consideration. Almost everyone (apart  from trade union activists) insists that wage control is still  essential in Poland and that allowing unrestricted wage  increases is bound to result in rising inflation.  Unfortunately, the situation we have witnessed since the  beginning of April is starting to look like a deliberate game of  provoking inflation. The president refuses to sign the  neopopiwek [enterprise tax on above-normative wages] act. The  prime minister says one day that we need the act, the next that  we can do perfectly well without it, and the day after that that  the coalition is in favor of introducing the neopopiwek after  all.    The Sejm finally approved the latest version of the wage  control bill, and, if all goes well, the resultant parliamentary  act will come into force by mid-May. If all goes well, that is,  because, although the president did agree that, for the time  being, wage control is necessary, that does not necessarily mean  that he will definitely endorse the new act. Let us hope he  will, but, even if he does, it will be a month and a half too  late. What will happen to wages and prices in that time? We  only need to look at what is happening to them already. The  result will be that our long-term goal--that is, single-digit  inflation in a few years' time--will still be a realistic  proposition, but the path leading to it will become progressivly  longer and more difficult, as it has become longer and more  difficult over these past few weeks. But that long-term goal is  not something we are seeking in the abstract, for its own sake.  This truth seems to be forgotten by those who should be most  interested in good economic results because the ultimate  assessment of their administration will largely depend on their  performance in that sphere.</p>

			<p><P> January 11, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ISRAEL FLOATING MIDEAST PEACE IDEAS  </P> <P> Israel has begun to float proposals on the form and substance of eventual  Middle East peace talks in the hope of countering efforts by the Palestine  Liberation Organization to begin negotiations aimed at creating a Palestinian  state.  </P> <P> Sources in the office of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and in the Foreign  Ministry say the proposed initiatives center on the 1978 Camp David accords  between Egypt and Israel, which provided for a period of "autonomy" for  Palestinians living under Israeli occupation.  </P> <P> They say that presentation of a plan will eventually coincide with a publicity  campaign to win the support of the American public and, specifically,  influential Jewish groups in the United States.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Once an Immovable Object  </P> <P> Independent observers have noted that the outlines of the ideas being floated  are little different from proposals as much as a decade old. They point out,  however, that because the plans are being weighed by Shamir, who has long been  considered an immovable object on peace talks, they reflect an effort by the  government to give a fresh face to Israeli policy.  </P> <P> "What is new is that these ideas come from Shamir," said Yaron Ezrahi, a  political theorist at Hebrew University. "It seems that at last he recognizes  that the situation is changing, so Israel must change to keep its head above  water."  </P> <P> A Foreign Ministry official said: "Shamir has some plans in mind. This is  clearly movement. But he hasn't reached any final decisions."  </P> <P> Shamir told government radio Tuesday that he had not yet worked out a "formal"  peace plan. Avi Pazner, his spokesman, would say only that the government is  "studying now certain ideas based on our principles."  </P> <P> The two comments were part of a denial of a report here in the Nation newspaper  that said Foreign Minister Moshe Arens gave U.S. Secretary of State George P.  Shultz a draft peace plan at a meeting on chemical warfare this week in Paris.  </P> <P> The report and the denials notwithstanding, a mosaic of proposals has appeared  here this week, both in conversations with government officials and in  published articles. Generally, the ideas center on two main issues: to whom  Israel would talk and what would be talked about.  </P> <P> First, the government remains opposed to talking with the PLO, which it views  as a terrorist organization committed to destroying Israel. However, Shamir is  toying with the idea of permitting elections in the occupied West Bank and Gaza  Strip aimed at letting Palestinians choose their own delegates to peace talks.  Previously, Shamir opposed such elections on the grounds that the PLO would  intimidate voters into voting for its candidates.  </P> <P> While conceding PLO victory in any such vote, the government views an election  as the lesser of two evils, the alternative being direct PLO representatives  chosen outside the occupied territories.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Only a Symbolic Role  </P> <P> Talks with the elected Palestinian delegates, plus officials from Egypt and  Jordan, could be held under the auspices of the United States and Soviet Union  or of the United Nations. But according to a report on Israel Radio, quoting  Shamir, the United Nations would play only a symbolic role and not "intervene"  in any way.  </P> <P> From Israel's point of view, the goal of such talks would be to grant limited  autonomy, rather than statehood, to Arabs in the West Bank and Gaza. Autonomy  is defined as local self-rule by Palestinians until a longer-term resolution is  worked out.  </P> <P> In an interview with The Times, a top Shamir assistant, Yosef Ben-Aharon, said  that under autonomy, Arabs would be able to select their own local leaders and,  if Jordan would permit it, legislators in the Jordanian Parliament. Ben-Aharon  called this a plan for "maximum autonomy."  </P> <P> Ben-Aharon outlined an eventual economic union of Israel and Jordan plus the  West Bank and Gaza Strip that would permit a free flow of goods and travel  across the borders of each "entity."  </P> <P> He said that Israel would maintain security within the West Bank and Gaza in  order to prohibit the "thrust of Arab power" from settling on Israel's  doorstep.  </P> <P> Ben-Aharon blamed an apparent delay in coming up with a new peace policy on the  coalition of Shamir's rightist Likud Party and the center-left Labor Party.  </P> <P> "New ideas have to be approved by a lot of people," he said, "and that is a  slow process."  </P> <P> The pressing interest here in producing a peace plan stems from Washington's  decision last month to talk with the PLO. The spectacle of Israel's foremost  ally talking with a group that sees peace coming in the form of a new  independent Arab state on Israel's borders stunned Israeli officials.  </P> <P> "We are against any independent state west of the Jordan River," Ben-Aharon  said. "Talks with the PLO would inevitably turn on the creation of a  Palestinian state."  </P> <P> Egypt and Jordan have both recognized the Palestinian state, as has the Soviet  Union. The Israeli concept of autonomy for the Palestinians is rejected by the  PLO and its international supporters as a means of creeping annexation of the  occupied territories by Israel.  </P> <P> Israel has embarked on a renewed diplomatic campaign to get its point across,  but the way does not look easy.  </P></p>

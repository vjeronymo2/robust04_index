			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Civil service unions seek meeting with PM CIVIL SERVICE union leaders are stepping up their campaign for union membership at GCHQ with demands to see Mr John Major, the prime minister, in an effort to break a deadlock in talks. Two hours of discussions between the five leading civil service unions and Sir Robin Butler, the cabinet secretary, on the possibility of ending the nine-year ban on union membership at the Cheltenham-based eavesdropping centre, ended in impasse yester-day. Union leaders said they were disappointed but not surprised at the outcome which they said hinged on the government's fears over the possibility of conflicting loyalties among union members. Mr Bill Brett, general secretary of the IPMS, which represents specialist and managerial civil servants, said: '(The talks) have not gone as well as we would have wished . . . I haven't heard anything which would enable us to reach an acceptable conclusion.' Mr Barry Reamsbottom, general secretary of the CPSA civil service union, said he was optimistic that Mr Major would agree to talks. The Cabinet Office said that the request to see the prime minister was being considered.</p>

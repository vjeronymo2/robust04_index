			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Valeriy Polyushko: "According to U.S. Satellite </F> Surveillance, There Is a Huge Oil Deposit in Priazovye"]    [Text] A representative of a Texas oil company paid an  unexpected visit to Priazovye rayon, in Zaporozhye Oblast. At a  meeting with local authorities, he stated that according to U.S.  satellite surveillance, there is a huge oil field in this rayon  and the adjacent stretch of Azov Sea, no smaller than the famous  field in Kuwait. N. Ormandzhi, deputy chairman of the oblast  administration, told a ZAPORIZKA PRAVDA correspondent that the  U.S. oil expert had offered Zaporozhye residents assistance in  surveying oil deposits, which he believes, lie about 1.5 km  below the surface. CIS-made drilling equipment cannot drill  deeper than 500 meters.    In the words of the guest, his company, if a relevant  agreement is signed, is ready to immediately allocate $10  million for exploratory and test drillings, and will demand no  compensation in the event of a negative result.    After the American toured the region, he asked for some  preliminary documentation, and promised to return in May. By  that time, the authorities need to make a decision.    However, the "Krymgeologiya" and presidential representative  in Priazovye rayon, N. Kalayanov, is very much in doubt that  there are oil deposits in the region. On the other hand, some  20 years ago, local residents often found some greasy liquid in  local rivers, the color and smell of which was reminiscent of  oil condensate that is always found near oil deposits.    While it remains to be seen whether U.S. experts will find  oil in the rayon, natural gas has already been found here, and  plenty of it. According to N. Oramndzhi, the size of gas  deposits may amount to 5 billion cubic meters -- or even larger,  because the 100-meter-deep layer runs way beyond the rayon's  boundary.    The "Krymgeologiya" state enterprise, with which the state  administration signed an agreement, has already started drilling  12 wells. Each of the wells will enable extraction of as much  as 1,000 cubic meters of gas per day. Experts estimate that  construction costs of those wells, 1.8 billion rubles, will be  earned back within eight months. Those estimates are well  grounded -- back in 1936, the first experimental gas-filling  station in the country was built in Priazovye rayon, and it  supplied natural gas to boiler-houses and automobiles until 1950.    So, gas is already in the rayon. There might also be oil.  Moneybags from Texas would not throw their money down the drain.</p>

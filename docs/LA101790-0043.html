			<p><P> October 17, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRISIS IN THE PERSIAN GULF;  </P> <P> OIL FIELD, 2 ISLES MAY BE IRAQ'S REAL GOAL;  </P> <P> STRATEGY: THE U.S. WORRIES THAT HUSSEIN MIGHT PULL BACK AND TRY TO HOLD ON TO  THIS TERRITORY.  </P> <P> One of the reasons virtually no Western experts anticipated Iraq's annexation  of Kuwait, officials now say, is that no one thought Iraqi President Saddam  Hussein had any interest in possessing most of the country.  </P> <P> What Hussein wanted, the officials believe, was only a small part of his  neighbor's land -- two strategic islands and a strip of territory covering the  southern end of an oil field that straddles the Iraq-Kuwait border.  </P> <P> Now, U.S. officials worry that Hussein might try to withdraw to that line,  making a "concession" of land that he never really wanted so that he can hold  onto what he really coveted all along.  </P> <P> The territory in question has two major points of interest -- the Rumaila oil  field, an oblong tract of land located mostly in Iraq with its southern end in  Kuwait, and the two islands of Bubiyan and Warba, which together control the  approaches to Iraq's chief port.  </P> <P> Before the invasion, U.S. officials were neutral on the question of whether  Iraq's claims to that land were valid.  </P> <P> "We have no opinion on Arab-Arab conflicts, like your border disagreement with  Kuwait," U.S. Ambassador April C. Glaspie told Hussein on July 25, in the last  meeting between a U.S. official and the Iraqi president before the invasion.  </P> <P> Now, however, the Bush Administration insists that Iraq must withdraw  unconditionally from all Kuwaiti territory.  </P> <P> "We do not think the emir (of Kuwait) should negotiate with a gun at his head,"  a senior Administration official said. Any territorial concessions that Kuwait  might make while Iraqi troops remain on its soil would merely reward Iraqi  aggression, Bush and his advisers argue.  </P> <P> At various points in its history, Iraq has asserted claims to all of Kuwait,  but the claims have been particularly insistent about Bubiyan and Warba.  </P> <P> The islands are barren mud flats, useless for most purposes. But they are all  that prevent virtually landlocked Iraq from being a nation with a 200-mile  coastline and the potential to be the dominant naval power in the Persian Gulf.  </P> <P> Now, all Iraqi shipping from its ports at Basra and Umm al Qasr must sail  around the two islands. A third port, Al Faw, was largely destroyed during the  Iran-Iraq War and remains essentially closed. Its shipping lanes also are  dominated by the Kuwaiti islands.  </P> <P> Rumaila, meanwhile, is one of the Middle East's largest pools of oil. The field  runs about 50 miles from north to south, with only two miles at the southern  end lying inside Kuwait. Oil industry experts say that the field might still  contain 30 billion barrels of oil, despite years of pumping.  </P> <P> Before the Iran-Iraq War, Rumaila, where oil was discovered in 1953, was one of  Iraq's biggest oil production centers. During the war, the Iraqis largely shut  down the field to protect it from Iranian attacks. The Kuwaitis, meanwhile,  continued to pump oil from their portion.  </P> <P> According to Iraq, the Kuwaiti pumping effectively siphoned oil from Iraq's  side of the field to Kuwait's, shifting resources 10,000 feet below ground in a  way that damaged Iraq's interests. Saddam Hussein has claimed that Kuwait owes  his country $2.4 billion for oil taken improperly from the Rumaila field.  Kuwaiti officials have denied that charge.  </P> <P> But some independent oil analysts say that the Iraqis may have a case --  although perhaps not for that full amount.  </P> <P> Kuwait has declined to say how much of its oil comes from Rumaila, but industry  analysts assume that the percentage is relatively small given how little of the  field lies inside Kuwait. Most Kuwaiti oil lies in the southern part of the  country, near the border with Saudi Arabia.  </P></p>

			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / International Company News: Strong advance at Swiss bank Union Bancaire Prive, one of Switzerland's largest private banks, has reported a 70 per cent jump in net income in 1993 to SFr183.3m (Dollars 131m). The Geneva-based bank, the product of the takeover of TDB American Express Bank by Mr Edgar de Picciotto's Compagnie de Banque et d'Investissement (CBI) in 1990, said conditions for its asset management business were 'exceptionally favourable' last year. Total assets grew 4.6 per cent to end at SFr11.2bn, as cash deposits shifted to off balance sheet investments. Shareholders' equity stood at SFr864m at the year-end.</p>

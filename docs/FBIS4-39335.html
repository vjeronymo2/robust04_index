			<p>BFN     [Text] North Korea rejects pressure as a tool to solve the  nuclear problem of the peninsula. Its Foreign Minister Kim  Yong-nam said so in Ukraine where he arrived on 6 June.    He said that direct talks with Seoul were the only way to  have the problem solved and that North Korea wanted to make the  Korean peninsula a nuclear-free zone.    Kim Yong-nam expressed the hope that the third round of  talks  between Pyongyang and Seoul would bring about positive results  in that field.    He welcomed Ukraine's desire to become a nonnuclear country.    Kim Yong-nam and his Ukrainian counterpart Anatoliy Zlenko  will have talks Monday afternoon.</p>

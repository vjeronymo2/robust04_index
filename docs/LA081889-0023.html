			<p><P> August 18, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE NOTES / ALAN DROOZ: COACH PAUL WESTHEAD JOINS KAREEM'S TOUR FOR AN  'EXCITING FINALE'  </P> <P> Loyola Marymount basketball Coach Paul Westhead was reunited with Kareem  Abdul-Jabbar for the big fella's recent Pacific exhibition tour, and may have  set up Kareem's last public sky hook.  </P> <P> International rules made it tougher to orchestrate.  </P> <P> Abdul-Jabbar and several other National Basketball Assn. veterans -- some  retired -- toured Australia and Taiwan last month. Jabbar and Westhead have  remained friends since Westhead was replaced as Lakers' coach in 1981, so  Westhead was pleased to be invited to coach the team, which included Artis  Gilmore and George Gervin.  </P> <P> Jabbar, of course, recently completed a 20-year NBA career. His final season  included retirement ceremonies in every NBA city. The NBA's all-time scoring  leader is one of the most recognizable athletes in the world.  </P> <P> At most stops on the Pacific trip, Westhead said, the team was introduced, then  Kareem made a grand entrance. "It was kind of an exciting finale to be with  Kareem. He was very well received," Westhead said.  </P> <P> While most of the contests were in Australia, the last game was in Taipei,  where the plan was for Kareem to hit a last shot late in the game, then  Westhead would call a timeout and allow Jabbar to make a dramatic exit. "Here,  in college or the pros, you can engineer that. But we were playing  international rules, where you can't call timeout unless there's a dead ball,"  Westhead said.  </P> <P> So, late in the game, the ball was passed in to Kareem, but he passed off.  Moments later, he had another chance but missed the shot.  </P> <P> With about a minute left, Westhead said, "He made the classic turnaround  skyhook. We couldn't call timeout but all of us on the bench went onto the  court and stopped the game. We weren't supposed to be able to do that but  nobody minded at that point.  </P> <P> "This was to be his last game, maybe for all time. Kareem made a nice kind of  tour of the court, shaking hands with fans along the side. I think he just  intended to do that with the people sitting there, but it was like everyone in  the stands took that as a signal and all the people in Taiwan came down to the  court. It was like the Pied Piper. So he made his final skyhook."  </P> <P> The international timeout rule, which bars timeouts for substitutions, made for  some tired ballplayers on the trip, Westhead said. "You could only play these  guys five or six minutes, then they'd give me a signal, like 'Take me out.'  Then, 'Please take me out!' And on the bench, 'We can't take you out.' We had  to wait for a dead ball."  </P> <P> The veteran team obviously couldn't play an all-out Loyola style, but Westhead  said that, curiously, the team still played better in a running attack. "Even  with their aged legs they performed better in the faster-paced games," he  noted. "The Australian team, which plays very methodical, hurt our team the  most at a slower pace."  </P> <P> Lions on the Move: There have been several coaching and administrative changes  in the Loyola athletic department. In men's soccer, Peter Novak has been named  coach. The 1982 graduate of Adelphi University in New York, who also coaches  the women's team, will be assisted by Jay Simon, a Loyola graduate. Bob Riley  has been named assistant volleyball coach. Riley, who has been a high school  coach in Honolulu for several years, joins the staff of Mike Normand, who is  beginning his first season with the Loyola women's team. Mike Sheehan, a 1985  graduate of Loyola, has been named coach of the men's and women's cross-country  teams. Sheehan, a veteran of 24 marathons, including Boston, New York and Los  Angeles, teaches at Daniel Murphy High School, where he is also track and field  coach.  </P> <P> On the administrative side, Bruce Woods, who has been a graduate assistant  coach in men's basketball for the last two years, has been named assistant to  the athletic director. The 1986 graduate of Wheeling College in West Virginia  will work under Athletic Director Brian Quinn and will continue to assist  basketball coaches Paul Westhead and Todd Corman.  </P> <P> Finally, Andy Marafino, a 1989 graduate of Loyola, has been named assistant  sports information director. The Connecticut native will oversee publicity for  women's basketball, baseball and volleyball.  </P> <P> One of the West Coast Conference's prospective basketball stars, Osei Appiah,  is out of the lineup at Santa Clara after transfer plans fell through.  </P> <P> Appiah, a Long Beach Poly High graduate, was a three-year part-time starting  guard at Santa Clara who averaged 9.1 points as a junior. In two games against  Loyola he averaged 16. But after the school year he asked out of his commitment  to Santa Clara and looked into transferring to an Ivy League school.  </P> <P> When his transfer plans didn't materialize, Appiah asked Santa Clara Coach  Carroll Williams to reinstate him. Williams is allowing Appiah to stay in  school and complete his studies but declined to put him back on the team.  </P> <P> Barring a last-minute transfer, Appiah will apparently be a spectator for his  senior year.  </P> <P> College Notes:  </P> <P> Loyola Marymount guard Bo Kimble leads the Sonny Hill League in scoring at 33.8  points per game in the latest stats from the Philadelphia-based summer  basketball league, ranking just ahead of an upcoming Loyola opponent, LaSalle's  Lionel Simmons at 33.3.  </P></p>

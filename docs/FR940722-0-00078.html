			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It is the State's responsibility to initiate a peer review of its RD&amp;T management process. An initial peer review should be undertaken sometime during the first three years after the State's management process has been approved by the FHWA Division Office. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The peer review is intended to review a State's management process, not the content of its RD&amp;T program. It will not be used for compliance or certification. Peer reviews should help in identifying, reinforcing, and conveying effective program approaches across the country and enable a nationwide sharing of successful practices and policies. The purpose of providing the peer review report and a written response to the report findings to the FHWA Division Administrator is primarily to keep the Division Administrator informed of the status of the State's program and what efforts are being taken to improve the program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The members of the peer review team will be selected by the State. The FHWA will establish criteria for team members and will develop and maintain a list of qualified individuals who will be available to serve on the teams. At least two members of the peer review team must be selected from this list. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A State may include a line item in its work program to pay for the peer review of its RD&amp;T program with FHWA planning and research funds. The FHWA will consider establishing a national pooled-fund project if there is sufficient interest from the States and if it would expedite the peer review process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ``periodic basis'' for conducting peer reviews has been determined by the FHWA to be once every three years. After experience has been gained operating under the new procedures, consideration will be given to extending the time period between reviews. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Comments were mixed on whether the proposed rule should be mandatory for all States or whether a State could continue to submit individual RD&amp;T studies for Federal approval. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The option to submit individual studies for Federal approval (i.e., to continue operating under current procedures) has not been included in the final rule. The regulations are mandatory for all States. The final regulation provides a State with considerable latitude in developing and managing its RD&amp;T activities and supports the intent of ISTEA to move the decisionmaking process to the State level. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FHWA is available, at a State's request, to assist in reviewing any RD&amp;T activities that are highly technical or require special expertise. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter stated that the FHWA's intent concerning the degree of RD&amp;T program interaction within State agencies should be more clearly stated. Specifically, expectations regarding the degree of management involvement at various organizational levels should be disclosed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Due to the different organizational structures of the States, it is not possible to be specific concerning the degree of management involvement. Each State should involve those management levels that are necessary to develop and implement an RD&amp;T program that addresses high priority transportation issues. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter stated that the NPRM implies that the FHWA is going to require a uniform format for State work programs since the information will be entered into a national data base. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There is no intent to require a uniform work program format. The FHWA will encourage the States to include summary sheets listing all studies and costs followed by more detailed information on individual studies in their work programs. Also, as part of its management process, each State is required to use the Transportation Research Board's Transportation Research Information Services (TRIS) for reporting its active RD&amp;T activities. It will be the State's responsibility to enter its new RD&amp;T activities into the TRIS data base. Since uniform entries will be required for the data base, it could reasonably result in the States' work programs becoming more uniform to simplify data entry. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

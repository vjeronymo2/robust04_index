			<p><P> July 25, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> White-Collar Cuts Rumored at Chrysler: Chrysler Corp. said its top 600  officials will meet Thursday with Chairman Lee A. Iacocca to discuss  cost-reduction efforts amid widespread industry speculation that Chrysler will  cut its white-collar staff. But the nation's No. 3 auto maker said any cuts  would not affect research and development, capital spending or long-term  product planning. The reported staff cuts at Chrysler would be the first  specifically prompted by the current slump in new car sales. Ford Motor Co. and  General Motors Corp. are trimming their white-collar payrolls through  previously announced programs.  </P></p>

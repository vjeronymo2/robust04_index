Kondratyev said, the losses were 53 dead and 77 wounded in  Tajikistan, 28 dead and 60 wounded in North Ossetia and  Ingushetia. The corresponding figures are 16/25 in  Transdniestria, 6/15 in Abkhazia, 2/1 in South Ossetia and 2/15  in former Yugoslavia.    Kondratyev did not think that any group of countries or  international organization would be able to perform peace  missions as effectively as Russian troops in the former USSR.    Answering an Interfax question Kondratyev said that the  country had spent 26 Bn [billion] rubles for peacekeeping  activities in 1993. He thought that this amount would increase  in 1994. He emphasized that the money had been made available  by the Defense Ministry and that the Peacekeeping Activities  Bill under consideration in the State Duma called for financing  such operations from the state budget.    Kondratyev said that the Russian Defense Ministry would  deploy its observers in the Karabakh war zone within two or  three days, once the waring sides separated and a security zone  set up.</p>

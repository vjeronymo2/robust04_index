			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by P. Popov, Vice President of the Agrotekhnologiya </F> [Agrotechnology] Joint Stock Society and candidate of  agricultural sciences: "`Agrotekhnologiya' Is Getting Down to  Work"]    [Text] Without exaggeration we can say that the country is  now in a state of agricultural crisis, the essence of which has  to do with the fact that village producers of agricultural  products have either inadequate or no assets. The application of  fertilizer has practically ceased, there is a shortage of  equipment to carry out these operations, soil degradation is in  progress, and the ecological balance is being violated.    It would seem that measures are being taken to correct this  situation. Land relations have been secured through legal  channels, and a multi-structural agricultural production base  has been approved. Farming enterprises are being created side by  side with large agricultural enterprises, the population is  being given plots of land, and dacha [summer house] and  horticultural-gardening cooperatives are being organized.  Gradually, competition is developing among all village goods  producers. This is the beginning of market ties and relations.    At the same time we have observed a multitude of negative  processes that hinder movement along the selected market path in  the economy. In particular, unnecessary fuss and haste have been  exhibited in eliminating large enterprises and there have been  attempts to forcefully introduce farming, whereas both processes  should be voluntary. Large enterprises may become genuine  collectives in the form of joint-stock societies, cooperatives  or partnerships. Land, the means of production, and ultimately  the results of work must belong to these collectives. Where  conditions exist, farming enterprises are being created, and  there should be no hindrance to this. Can it be that we cannot  deal with this simple matter? I think that we can. Everyone must  simply be a facilitator instead of interfering with the  development of judicious multi-structural land ownership.    It is from these positions that economic transformation of  the village should be managed. But very complicated problems  arise in the process of reform. One of them is the use of  chemical agents, equipment and scientific elaborations.    With the transition to market relations we have noted a  negative tendency to partially or fully reject fertilizer in  connection with its increased cost. Directors of enterprises say  that for 1-2 years they will be able to do without the purchase  of chemical agents and equipment by using existing reserves.  Most likely this will not be a success -- working with a machine  until it wears out will not yield good results. In addition, it  could bring with it a curtailment in the production of chemical  agents and a reorientation of production capacities. In other  words, agriculture will simply exacerbate its predicament. We  should consider that if a wheat yield of 15-20 quintals per  hectare requires one pesticide treatment and the application of  70-180 kilograms of fertilizer per hectare, then a productivity  of 30-35 quintals will require six pesticide treatments and  300-420 kilograms of fertilizer per hectare. In this way, the  noted tendency to refuse fertilizer, pesticides and new  equipment will result in a sharp drop in soil fertility and thus  in a significant decrease in the harvest.    In recent years ecological problems have become particularly  urgent in agriculture. Avoiding pollution of soil and crops with  chemical agents requires their balanced and comprehensive use on  the basis of soil and leaf diagnostics. Effective and safe use  is impossible without the newest machines and equipment and the  leading technologies.    Ideas about the negative aspects of chemicals in agriculture  are taking hold more and more firmly in the mass media. What is  not mentioned is that in the entire world the knowledgeable use  of large doses of mineral fertilizers is the foundation for  producing large and stable harvests. Let me cite certain  figures. In 1991 in the USSR, 120 kilograms of active substance  was applied per hectare; in Holland -- 800. The productivity of  grains equalled 18 and 70 quintals per hectare respectively. In  the USSR pesticides were used on 30-35 percent of sowing area,  in the U.S. -- on 90 percent, and in Japan -- on 100 percent of  total area. Meanwhile, the life expectancy of an individual  equals 70, 75 and 78 years respectively.    In this case what should concern us more today -- ecology or  soil fertility and the size of the harvest? Obviously we should  look at both without contrasting one with the other. Increasing  the return on fertilizer should be one of our main tasks because  it is still low here. The introduction of one kilogram of  nutrients with fertilizers yields 7.3 kilograms of grain abroad  and 3-5 kilograms in the Russian Federation. Expenditures of  mineral fertilizers to produce a tonne of agricultural product  is 2.6 times greater here than in the U.S..    In connection with the difficult economic situation in the  country, particularly within agricultural production, the  agrochemical potential that has been developed since the early  1970's (Selkhozkhimiya [Agrochemical] Specialized Association,  agrochemical laboratories, and stations for chemicalization and  plant protection), at the present time is collapsing, and in  some places has already collapsed. Under these difficult  conditions it is essential to seek new, non-traditional  approaches not only to the agrochemical service, but to the  entire complex of scientific-technical services within the new  multi-structural agricultural production base as well. Most  likely, direct ties between producers of agricultural products  and enterprises that produce material-technical resources, as  well as scientific-research and planning-research institutions  will be of more and more significance.    For example, after the elimination of Soyuzselkhozkhimiya  [All-Union Agricultural Chemical Association], the  Agrotekhnologiya Joint Stock Society was created with the goal  of further realizing accumulated scientific-technical potential  and of effectively utilizing the highly trained specialists of  this association's apparatus. Its founders include the Agrokhim  Russian Agrochemical Company, Avtoselkhozmash [Agricultural  Vehicle and Machinery] Holding Association, Rossiyskiye Semena  [Russian Seed] Joint-Stock Society, and the Russian Academy of  Agricultural Sciences. We have selected contemporary  scientific-technical supply of agroindustrial production as our  main direction. Our clients and partners are kolkhozes,  sovkhozes, joint-stock societies, partnerships, farmers, and  individual land users regardless of form of ownership or  management. All relations are built on direct contracts and a  mutually advantageous foundation.    During last and this year the society has concluded  contracts  with large producers to assimilate intensive technologies for  raising wheat, corn, sugar beets, potatoes, soybeans and other  crops. We are carrying out this work jointly with enterprises,  first and foremost, in large land-management regions --  Krasnodarskiy Kray, and Rostov, Voronezh, Orel, Belgorod,  Lipetsk, Tambov, Tula, and Penza oblasts.    Everything begins with traditional technological maps, which  with a consideration of agricultural resources, soil fertility  and management-economic conditions, are made more precise by us  jointly with agronomists and engineers from enterprises. In  carrying out their obligations, our specialists are concerned  about supplying enterprises with hybrid corn, peas and other  seed, and satisfying demand for the most effective fertilizers,  agricultural equipment and plant protection agents.  Agrotechnological classes and seminars are held for workers of  agricultural enterprises. In striving to alleviate financial  problems, we try to sell these agricultural resources under  favorable conditions and as inexpensively as possible for the  consumer. We do not chase after super profits, and for this  reason, overhead expenses are curtailed to 7-8 percent.  Incidentally, enterprises pay us in money as well as in  agricultural products.    In enterprises that have contracts with us, the productivity  of grains and legumes, including corn, increased last year by an  average of 3 quintals per hectare; of sugar beets -- by 30-50. A  large savings in resources is achieved when they are utilized  more effectively.    Another direction in our operations involves providing  agricultural services to the small producer of agricultural  products, beginning with the farmer and ending with the  cultivators of dacha plots and members of horticultural-garden  cooperatives. Unfortunately, we have not yet created an orderly  system for supplying the population with technology and  agricultural resources with stability. Farming enterprises have  found themselves in particularly difficult circumstances because  they are not supplied with chemical agents, small equipment,  seed and scientific-technical elaborations either through the  centralized supply system for kolkhozes, sovkhozes and  joint-stock societies created on the basis of kolkhozes or  sovkhozes or through government and cooperative trading, which  has also undergone reforms everywhere, or through  scientific-research institutions and the agronomic service.  Nevertheless, practically all individual land users understand  that without a positive solution to these problems it is  impossible to cultivate a good harvest of most agricultural  crops.    It is no secret to anyone that during moist years up to  30-50  percent of the potato harvest perishes from phytophthora, and of  the cucumber harvest -- from peronosporosis. During dry years  potato plantations become severely infested with the Colorado  potato beetle. Individuals do not always have mineral  fertilizer, seed and a horticultural inventory to carry out  seasonal operations. Due to the absence of chemical ameliorative  agents on the market the population loses up to 25-30 percent of  harvest potential annually. In the Non-Chernozem Zone alone the  demand for such agents equals over 7,000 tonnes annually. In  connection with this, Agrotekhnologiya has begun to create local  specialized partnerships to provide technological supplies to  individual land users. At the present time such partnerships  have been created in Moscow, Leningrad, Lipetsk, Belgorod, and  Vladimir oblasts and Krasnodar Kray. This work is carried out in  close cooperation with local Selkhozkhimiya associations. Last  year partnerships fully supplied the demand for chemical  ameliorative agents by over 60,000 individual land users. The  society together with the Vitebsk Dolomit Production Association  has organized the production of dolomite meal packed in small  packages (5-25 kilograms). This is the best soil amelioration  agent, containing the vital microelement magnesium in addition  to calcium.    Agrochemical soil analyses on fine-contour farm plots and in  dacha and horticultural-gardening cooperatives and technological  consultations with land users on the effective and ecologically  safe use of fertilizers and plant protection agents are provided  jointly with chemicalization stations.    Through the system of partnerships individual land users are  supplied with significant quantities of vegetable seed, the  framework for dacha hothouses and hotbeds, panels, and  horticultural-gardening inventory.    The simplest accounts show that improved availability to  individual land users, especially farming (peasant) enterprises,  of essential agricultural resources and technological services  will enable them to greatly improve land productivity and to  increase the production of potatoes, vegetables, fruit and  livestock raising by 15-20 percent.    Such experience exists. The first positive results also  exist. But they can be more weighty if we unify our efforts and  the efforts of many other production-technical,  commercial-supply, agronomic and variety seed farming  organizations, including the structures of the RF Ministry of  Agriculture and Food and of local agricultural organs.</p>

			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / US funds for Czech N-plant The US Export-Import Bank has given its final approval to Dollars 317m (Pounds 217m) of loan guarantees for upgrading the controversial Soviet-designed nuclear reactor at Temelin, in the Czech Republic. Temelin is close to the Czech border with Austria, and the Austrian government has fiercely contested the plans to bring the still uncompleted reactor into service. Eximbank said its guarantees would help finance Dollars 334m of improvements to be carried out by Westinghouse Electric to the instrumentation, control and fuel systems of the Temelin reactor. Studies by the US and by the International Atomic Energy Agency have indicated that the Soviet VVER-1000 reactor can be operated as safely as western-designed light water reactors, so long as control improvements are made. The control system Westinghouse will install at Temelin is, according to US nuclear experts, more advanced than that operating at the UK's Sizewell B reactor.</p>

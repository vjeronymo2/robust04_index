			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / Willis is hopeful on talks with Shephard LEADERS OF the Trades Union Congress will meet the Mrs Gillian Shephard, employment secretary, in 10 days amid signs that a friendlier and more constructive dialogue between unions and the government can be established. Mr Norman Willis, TUC general secretary, and his deputy Mr John Monks will meet Mrs Shephard on June 9. They are keen to establish more common ground than existed with Mr Michael Howard, her more hard-line predecessor. TUC officials say that they have lately been receiving encouraging signs from senior Department of Employment officials suggesting that Mrs Shephard is interested in more than a token meeting. They believe she would not have produced a white paper like Mr Howard's, which was hostile to collective bargaining and even moderate trade unionism. Re-establishing a better dialogue with the government is especially important to the TUC at present as its future is increasingly being questioned by the larger unions. In view of its lack of success as a government lobbyist in recent years, some unions want the TUC to stop thinking of itself as a trade-union civil service and concentrate on two or three functions, such as lobbying in the European Community. The TUC has no direct representative in Brussels. Whatever Mrs Shephard's real feelings, she will be unable to back away from any of the Conservative manifesto commitments drawn from the white paper - especially reform of the 'automatic check-off' of union dues and the abolition of the Bridlington agreement regulating inter-union disputes. Mrs Shephard might concede something to the TUC in the detail of those proposals. On check-off, it has not yet been decided whether members have to be consulted only every three years or also every time dues are increased.</p>

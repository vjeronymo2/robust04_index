			<p>BFN     [Text] Cajnice, 20 Apr (TANJUG) -- Following strong Muslim  attacks yesterday, fighting on the Gorazde front resumed this  morning with extreme ferocity along the entire line of  confrontation, the Herzegovina corps command has announced.  Muslims have so far failed to observe any of the existing  cease- fire agreements, the Herzegovina corps command said,  adding that Muslims will probably try to take advantage of the  deployment of the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] in the area of  Gorazde to provoke the Serbs and to accuse them of attacking the  force of the international community. The most intense fire is  coming from the center of the town. Muslims are using mortars,  anti-aircraft weapons, and snipers, the Herzegovina corps  command insists.    Despite orders from its high command, the Serbian side has  been forced to respond to the Muslim attacks. The Herzegovina  corps command insists that there is no truth in the Muslim  claims that Serbian fighters have been pounding the Gorazde  urban area with artillery weapons. Late yesterday afternoon,  NATO planes overflew Serbian positions on the Gorazde front but  at permitted altitude and did not engage in any combat activity.</p>

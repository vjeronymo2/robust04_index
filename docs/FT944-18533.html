			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / Equity Markets: Vulnerable to fears of further tightening - London Fund managers and stockbroker analysts face an uncomfortable Monday morning. The third quarter of 1994 has come and gone, leaving little behind in the way of significant equity performance and with market fears of a tightening in Federal Reserve credit policy increased by the latest data on US gross domestic product and housing starts. Not the best opening to a final trading quarter, which requires the UK market to gain up to 20 per cent if it is to meet the most optimistic of City forecasts for the FT-SE 100 Index at the year-end. With at least two leading international investment bankers still prepared to compare October 1994 with October 1987, even if they do finally reject the comparison, it is not surprising that some nervousness is creeping into analysts' forecasts. SG Warburg has taken the plunge and cut its year-end Footsie forecast from 3,500 to 3,250 - 'a more plausible central assumption', says the Warburg strategy team, in view of the absence of significant recovery of confidence in global bond markets. For Footsie 3,500, Warburg says we will all have to wait until December 1995; no comfort at all to those houses still holding firm to this target for the end of this year. Rising bond yields have returned to haunt the UK stock market, perhaps even surpassing corporate earnings uncertainty as a governing influence. Kleinwort Benson Securities sees the London equity market as particularly vulnerable, and has cut the UK weighting of its recommended equity allocation from 12 to 10 per cent. Kleinwort is keen on cash (10 per cent recommended), a view that found favour last week with some fund managers, who decided trustees might be impressed if they sold UK equities even if returns on cash are not impressive. Leanings towards cash are echoed by UBS in its comparison of the present market scenario with that of 1987. It rejects any suggestions of a major disaster, but says that worries over equity valuations, a weak US currency and high real interest rates could drive investors to the short end of global government bond markets. Goldman Sachs, the other house to refer back to 1987, also says 'short-term oriented investors might usefully boost their cash holdings'. For the medium term, Goldman is optimistic on equities, believing that US economic recovery will last at least into 1966. Nor are these uncertainties mere long-range views. The UK stock market has proved itself still highly vulnerable to fears of further tightening in global credit policies. This Friday's announcement of US payroll data, expected to be strong, could trigger a further aggressive tightening by the Fed, 'not just in October but subsequently', according to Kleinwort.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 17 (YONHAP) -- Deputy Prime Minister Yi  Hong-ku on Tuesday regretted the remarks made recently by Kim  Tae-chung, chairman of the Asia-Pacific Peace Foundation, with  respect to the North Korean nuclear question.    "I regret that chairman Kim made remarks of a kind not  fitting to a government policy and our public sentiments,  causing various problems," Yi said.    Kim is said to have stated during his stay in the United  States that even if North Korea possesses several nuclear bombs,  it doesn't pose any problem.    In a comment, Deputy Premier Yi who is also national  unification minister said that if North Korea comes to have any  nuclear arms, military and political balance between South and  North Korea would be shattered outright, bringing about a  serious problem to the national security of South Korea.    "Our government stand is that North Korea should not possess  even a single nuclear weapon and that if they have any, it  should be destroyed under all circumstances," Yi said.    The deputy prime minister also rejected as "improper" Kim  Tae-chung's idea of inviting Kim Il-song to the United States  and sending Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter to North Korea as  a special envoy. His proposition cannot be of any help to the  government policy of resolving inter-Korean issues through talks  between the direct parties involved, namely, South and North  Korea, Yi said.</p>

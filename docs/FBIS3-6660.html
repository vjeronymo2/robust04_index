A NODONG SINMUN analyst today says the ulterior intention of  Japan in hosting the "forum" is to divert elsewhere the cautious  eyes of the international community against its nuclear armament  and moves toward a military power and to give itself a boost,  increase its say and exercise its influence in the security  issue by dint of its economic potentials and take the leading  position in the Asia-Pacific region.    The news analyst goes on:    Japan has grown into a dangerous aggression force in the  Asia-Pacific region. Peace and security not only in northeast  Asia but in the Asia-Pacific region is gravely threatened by  Japan.    It is the height of folly for Japan to play host to a  "forum"  on security matters, a country which has defined a broad sphere  of the Asia-Pacific region as its operational theatre with an  aggressive design on the countries in this region.    It is a customary practice of the Japanese ruling quarters  to  satisfy their own interests by taking issue with others.    Japanese trigger-happy elements may call for "joint  countermeasures" against somebody's "nuclear threat" when the  "forum" is opened.    By so doing the Japanese reactionaries are intending to  cover  up their nuclear armament and moves toward a military power and  step up their preparations for overseas aggression in real  earnest behind the facade of "security".    The Japanese ruling quarters' talk about a "forum" on  security in the Asia-Pacific region and the like is nothing but  a petty trick to prettify their aggressive and dominationist  nature.</p>

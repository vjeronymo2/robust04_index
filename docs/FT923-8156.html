			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / Book Review: Policy and pragmatism MEETING THE GLOBAL CHALLENGE: Establishing a successful European industrial policy By Martin Bangemann Kogan Page Pounds 14.95. 155 pages The trouble with the concept of industrial policy is that it means different things to the same people. Most of us would agree, if asked, that industry is likely to be better run by industrialists than by civil servants. Many of us would also confess to a nagging sense that when it comes to the national interest, reason ought to work better than blind market forces. These positions are basically incompatible. That does not stop us holding both at once. When it comes to European as opposed to national policy, it gets more tangled again. Most informed opinion in the EC would doubtless think it a good thing for Europe to have a competitor in, say, electronics or aerospace big enough to take on the giants of Japan or the US. But the British or German public might feel differently if the company in question turned out to be Italian or French. They might also take a different view on whether the aforesaid competitor deserved to be supported by EC funds. Martin Bangemann, the EC commissioner for industry, has written a book which positively bristles with suppressed contradictions. He would probably not mind it being so described. He argues, as a politician, for compromise and dialogue. In politics, he remarks, this kind of thing passes as normal, since politics is considered a dirty business. Talk between government and industry, on the other hand, is regarded as a sin against free trade. This needs to change. This does not necessarily make Bangemann an old-style interventionist, or indeed a dogmatist of any identifiable kind. Backing industrial sectors on strategic grounds, he says, only works if governments act like the private investor and think in terms of risk and reward. Anything else leads ultimately to subsidy. Subsidies are not a bad thing by definition, he adds cautiously. But propping up unprofitable companies by subsidy is 'the most expensive and detestable form of social policy: pointless work is almost worse than no work at all'. If the book has a unifying thesis, it is that the best hope for European industry lies in the competitive discipline imposed by the single market. Companies which can hold their own in the single market are ready to take on the world. This need not mean giant European corporations: 'Small is not always weak, and unprofitable and big is not always strong.' On examination, this last bit looks like a tactical disclaimer. In discussing industries as diverse as electronics, shipbuilding and aerospace, Bangemann works round to the conclusion that what is needed is size and agglomeration. European companies are generally not very big by comparison with their Japanese or American competitors. Size, he says, does not automatically mean monopoly. The European Commission needs to accept the single market as the yardstick in applying competition policy. All this, of course, brings Bangemann into direct conflict with his opposite number Sir Leon Brittan, the competition commissioner. Sir Leon has provided a foreword to the book which is a model of the diplomatic put-down. 'A thought-provoking book . . . An important contribution . . . Few readers, I suspect, will accept everything in this book . . . there is much, indeed, that I would dispute myself.' All the same, Bangemann makes a powerful case against the idea that industrial policy can consist of leaving industry alone: what one might term in a UK context the Lilley doctrine. The fact is that governments are deeply involved whether they like it or not. They are, for a start, very important industrial customers. How they exercise their purchasing power - buying the cheapest possible rather than the technologically advanced, or giving orders to domestic companies to keep them in business - has a profound effect on how competitive those companies become in a wider world. When it comes to government orders, as Bangemann says, supply is only as good as demand. It is also hard to disagree that the worst possible type of industrial policy is 'that which is conducted half-heartedly and with a bad conscience'. Indeed, the lack of a visible industrial policy can be dangerous. The likely result, as Bangemann says, is a concealed industrial policy, disguised as social, research or regional policy. In the final analysis, the Bangemann approach is pragmatic. This leads to different answers for different industries. Shipbuilding needs active EC intervention and funding. The car industry needs the gradual introduction of Japanese competition as a means of forcing European carmakers to address world markets. The electronics industry needs the competition authorities to get out of the way so that it can get on with its own amalgamation. In each case, the approach is only as good as the analysis. In some cases there is, as Sir Leon would say, much to dispute. It follows that one does not come away from this short and readable book with a sense of a master-planner at work. And, some might say, a very good thing too.</p>

			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / International Company News: Schweitzer is new head at Renault THE French cabinet yesterday named Mr Louis Schweitzer, managing director of Renault, as chairman of the state-owned car group, the first of more than 40 top state sector jobs due for review in the next few months. He was put forward by Mr Raymond Levy, his predecessor, who has retired after six years at the wheel. He also has the support of Volvo, the French group's Swedish partner, with which Mr Schweitzer negotiated an alliance two years ago. Mr Schweitzer is expected to continue to follow Mr Levy's strategies, a smooth succession which sets the tone for nominations of other state sector chairmen. Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the prime minister, has said he wants to ensure management continuity in state-controlled companies, especially important at a time when the government is embarking on a programme of privatisations. The nominations are also important to the economy generally, as seven of France's top 10 companies are state-owned. Mr Beregovoy's unwillingness to interfere in the professional management of the state sector contrasts with the more hands-on approach of his predecessor, Mrs Edith Cresson. This is also a contrast to the last time the mandates of state company chairmen came up for renewal, in 1989, when up to a third of the 43 people then involved resigned or were asked to leave. Stock market expectation is that change is least likely at the heads of industrial heavyweights such as Usinor Sacilor, the steel group, Elf Aquitaine and Total in oil, Rhone-Poulenc in chemicals, the Pechiney aluminium group and Air France.</p>

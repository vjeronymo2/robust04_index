			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Swalec achieves 19% improvement to Pounds 104m Swalec, the south Wales electricity utility, aims to maintain a progressive dividend policy whatever the outcome of the review of the electricity distribution business by Prof Stephen Littlechild, the industry regulator. The company said yesterday that the review was widely expected to reduce profits throughout the electricity sector. But Swalec was confident that its cost-cutting and diversification policy was correct. The results of the review are due later this summer, and will set controls over businesses which account for 80 per cent of regional electricity company profits. Swalec reported a 19.5 per cent increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 87m to Pounds 104m on sales of continuing businesses of Pounds 605m (Pounds 586m). A 15 per cent rise in the final dividend to 18.1p brings the full year pay-out to 25.6p (22.3p). Earnings were 73.6p (60p). Mr Andrew Walker, the new chief executive, said one of the main factors behind the rise was the cost-cutting drive, which brought costs down 8 per cent in real terms. This drive would continue into a further phase, he said, though he declined to give specific numbers for job losses. The group also received its first returns from new generation projects: a gas-fired power plant on Teesside and a wind farm in Cumbria. Profit growth came from the distribution business which raised its contribution by Pounds 10.8m to Pounds 79.3m. The supply business increased profits by Pounds 800,000 to Pounds 6.6m. Celtic, the contracting arm, suffered an operating loss of Pounds 2.2m in a difficult market after reorganisation costs of Pounds 1.4m. Swalec also has a 40 per cent interest in CSW, a new cable TV and telecommunications company, for which an investment of Pounds 30m is foreseen over the next four years. The result included a Pounds 10.2m (Pounds 9.1m) dividend from the National Grid. Mr Walker said Swalec supported the proposed sale of the National Grid, and took the view that the shares should be handed straight to the shareholders of the regional electricity companies. COMMENT Swalec is putting a brave face on the distribution review because it is potentially one of the more exposed recs. With high costs due to the widely dispersed market it serves, Swalec needs higher rates of return, and it is up to Prof Littlechild to decide whether these are justified. As it is, Swalec's electricity prices are already among the highest in the country. The results were well received in the market, where the shares gained 6p to 635p. With further progress on cost-cutting, and problems on the contracting side under tighter control, analysts felt Swalec should be making solid progress. Nonetheless, the shares carry the second highest yield in the sector - 5.7 per cent - due to the regulatory vulnerability.</p>

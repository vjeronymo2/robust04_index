			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Yelena Yakovleva report: "Nizhniy Novgorod Model of Land </F> Reform Becomes All-Russia Model"]    [Text] It has become known that Prime Minister V.  Chernomyrdin has signed documents approving the Nizhniy Novgorod  version of land reform as the model for Russia.    The Nizhniy Novgorod governor, who was counting on nothing  less than a "model for Russia," is to be congratulated. The  scientific "curators" from the IMF are also to be congratulated  -- this is a rare successful project in Russia. (An American  expert told me that he had neglected some more important work  just so that he would be able to tell his son: "I was involved  in privatization in Russia!") Our own "practical workers and  theoreticians" should not be forgotten either -- kolkhoz  chairmen and scientists from the Agrarian Institute who had  started this work earlier in Rostov and Samara Oblasts but were  unable to present it to the public as [Governor] Nemtsov has  done with the Americans.    The Nizhniy Novgorod option may be welcome to the people and  the government because it is mild and does not presuppose  "giving anybody a hard time"; it is a model for the natural  growth of private farms from collective farms that is  calculated, as Allan Bigman, one of the American leaders of the  project, said, to take 20 years. Essentially this is a  mechanism which regularly "opens doors" to those who want to  leave kolkhozes and go into private farming, removes political  resistance (the displeasure of the kolkhoz chairman), and  overcomes economic resistance (the impossibility of building up  a decent-sized plot of land and finding the money to cultivate  it).    It is curious that people with a variety of views like the  Nizhniy Novgorod option -- for instance the famous journalist  Yuriy Chernichenko and the famous economist Aleksey Yemelyanov,  who recently made opposite assessments of the same events.  Mikhail Lapshin, chairman of the Agrarian Party and the  "chairman body" that he personifies do not like it, but  presumably Chernomyrdin's signature will remove the  dissatisfaction.    A fly in the ointment: The Nizhniy Novgorod model can easily  be profaned. There is a natural law in Russia that the most  radical reformist decision can be rehashed by the people  implementing it until it reaches its exact antithesis. What  could be more "dangerous" than a law giving peasants plots of  land as their own property? Yet one or two extra features in  the decrees, one or two imperfections in the Russian Federation  Committee for Land Resources and Land Management's solemn  promises to do everything tomorrow -- and suddenly all the plots  of land that have apparently been turned into private property  can serve to secure the kolkhoz chairman against any  encroachments on his farm. He says: On my farm the people own  everything. Yet the majority of peasants do not even suspect  that they have ownership rights.    The Nizhniy Novgorod model presupposes complex calculations,  not always comprehensible to ordinary people, and the honesty of  these calculations and land and property auctions can be ensured  either by a sincere desire on the part of the kolkhoz chairman  to seriously reform, or by careful surveillance by American  experts. There are not that many reformer-chairmen, and there  will not be enough Americans to go around all the Russian  kolkhozes.</p>

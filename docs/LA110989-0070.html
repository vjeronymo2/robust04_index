			<p><P> November 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: TOPANGA;  </P> <P> BID TO THWART DAY LABORERS  </P> <P> In a bid to discourage itinerant workers in the community, the Topanga Town  Council has set up a telephone hot line for residents to report suspected  illegal immigrants and the people who hire them, a member of the council's  board of directors said.  </P> <P> Board Member Pauline Rogers said residents were being asked to call 455-3000 to  report incidents involving itinerant workers in Topanga, including the license  plates of contractors and others who stop along Topanga Canyon Boulevard and  elsewhere to hire them.  </P> <P> She said the effort aims to reduce the number of day laborers in the area,  several dozen of whom are said to inhabit primitive camps in the Santa Monica  Mountains that pose a fire danger.  </P> <P> U.S. Border Patrol officers arrested 41 illegal immigrants in Malibu and  Topanga two weeks ago, although officials said only several were arrested at  Topanga.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Ministry of Industry and Minerals has emphasized  that its technical and engineering cadres specialized in the  electrical sector are doing their best to ensure that electrical  current reaches all parts of the country.    Subhi Nijm al-'Ani, director general of the Electricity  Department said that ensuring constant electrical current  depends on citizens' cooperation with the technical organs  through rationing consumption of electrical power and avoiding  unnecessary consumption or unjustified extravagance.    He said such intentional extravagance in electricity  consumption includes switching on a large number of lights in  gardens and houses, which wastes a great deal of energy and  encroaches on the rights of others.    He said the best type of light for rationing electricity is  the neon light because it consumes less energy and gives more  light.</p>

			<p><P> April 3, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INKSTER FINISHES WITH A FIVE-STROKE VICTORY  </P> <P> After Juli Inkster hit her tee shot on the par three, 17th hole Sunday at the  $500,000 Nabisco Dinah Shore tournament, her playing partner, JoAnne Carner,  had something to say.  </P> <P> "She said, 'Take it easy on us. Relax. You're getting too far ahead,' " Inkster  recalled.  </P> <P> At that point, the tournament at Mission Hills Country Club that belonged to  Inkster since the opening round was virtually history.  </P> <P> After getting a par at No. 17, Inkster birdied the par five, 526-yard 18th hole  to increase her winning margin to five strokes.  </P> <P> By winning, Inkster earned $80,000 and has now won three major LPGA  tournaments. She previously won the Dinah Shore and the du Maurier Classic in  1984. She has also won three U.S. amateur titles.  </P> <P> Moreover, her margin of victory was the largest in the 18-year history of the  Dinah Shore tournament.  </P> <P> Inkster shot a one-under-par 71 Sunday for a 72-hole total of 279. Carner, with  four consecutive rounds of 71, finished second in a tie with Tammie Green at  284. Green shot a final round 69.  </P> <P> "I love this course. It suits my game," Inkster said. "I'm usually like a  Yo-Yo, good and bad. But I put four solid rounds together and putted extremely  well."  </P> <P> There wasn't much drama on another warm day in the desert. However, after  Carner birdied the par five, 499-yard fifth hole and Inkster bogeyed it, the  eventual winner had only a three-shot lead.  </P> <P> Carner said that Inkster was faltering slightly at that juncture. Then, Inkster  made a 20-foot putt to save par on the par four, 357-yard 12th hole.  </P> <P> "That putt just brightened her day," Carner said.  </P> <P> Inkster agreed that the 12th hole was instrumental to her victory. Playing  confidently, she birdied the par four, 390-yard 16th hole after her approach  shot landed three feet from the pin. And she punctuated her runaway victory  with a 15-foot birdie putt on the 18th hole.  </P> <P> Carner said that Inkster also made a great shot from the fairway on the par  four, 375-yard sixth hole.  </P> <P> "She was stymied by a palm tree and then hit a nine-iron over the tree and onto  the green where she two putted to save par," Carner said.  </P> <P> As the front runner, Inkster had only one concern before the final round:  "Everybody is shooting at me and I have no one to shoot at."  </P> <P> But she said she was calm on the way to the course Sunday. Her husband, Brian,  the pro at Los Altos Country Club, probably was more nervous. But he stayed out  of view of his wife until the final putt.  </P> <P> Then, he joined her to celebrate.  </P> <P> Inkster, 28, said her victory here in 1984 got her career going and Sunday's  win raised her game another notch.  </P> <P> Inkster said that she was inspired by playing with Carner, who will celebrate  her 50th birthday Tuesday.  </P> <P> Carner and Green each earned $34,000 for their finish.  </P> <P> When Carner teed off someone from the gallery yelled, "Happy 50th birthday."  Then, someone else responded, shouting, "She's 39 and holding."  </P> <P> Later, in the interview room, Carner, already a member of the LPGA Hall of Fame  said: "If I were 39, I'd be leading by seven shots."  </P> <P> It was Carner's best finish in the Dinah Shore and, when asked to describe her  feelings, she said: "I feel great. I made enough money to go fishing."  </P> <P> Inkster, who has 12 career victories since joining the tour in 1983, had mixed  feelings about leading throughout the tournament.  </P> <P> "It's a great feeling, but it's tiring mentally," she said.  </P> <P> Green, playing in a group two holes ahead of Inkster and Carner, was seemingly  out of contention Saturday when she shot a 75. But she came back with a 69  Sunday.  </P> <P> "It's my best finish by far," said Green, an Ohio native who joined the tour in  1987.  </P> <P> After bogeying the first hole, Green, 29, birdied the ninth, 11th, 14th and  16th holes. So she had a chance if Inkster faltered.  </P> <P> "I didn't have to look at the leader board because the crowd told me where I  was," Green said.  </P> <P> It wasn't, however, a memorable tournament for Amy Alcott, the defending  champion, and Nancy Lopez, an established tour star.  </P> <P> Alcott, after shooting a 71 Thursday, had rounds of 78, 78 and 76 for a 72-hole  total of 303. Lopez finished at 291, 12 strokes behind Inkster.  </P> <P> Inkster, who plans to play in the AI Star-Centinela Hospital Classic April  14-16 at Rancho Park, had one final observation:  </P> <P> "I'm the only one who has a chance to win the grand slam now," she said,  referring to the four majors, the Dinah Shore, du Maurier, the Mazda LPGA  Classic and the U.S. Women's Open.  </P></p>

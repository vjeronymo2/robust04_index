			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / A-Z of Personal Finance (8): Keep awake to read the small print - Guarantees THE WORD 'guarantee' seems to give many investors the ability to sleep soundly at nights. Over the past year, there have been guaranteed products in the fields of fixed interest, property and equities. But investors should never forget one thing; the guarantee is only as good as the institution offering it. A prime example was Birmingham Capital Trust, a small banking institution, which guaranteed to pay no less than 12 per cent per annum over five years on its tax-exempt special savings account (Tessa). At the end of 1992, however, the bank wrote to Tessa holders, telling them that 'due to a major erosion of the capital base of the company' the account would be shut down. Investors were recommended to switch to the Dudley Building Society, which was then offering a much lower (and variable) return of 8.5 per cent. So when offered a guarantee (especially one that lasts a long time), investors should carefully consider whether the company will be strong enough to honour it. A second point is to make sure what exactly is being guaranteed. The Scottish Widows Monthly Bond, offered at the end of last year, was a case in point. The advertisement offered up to 9.2 per cent per annum net for five years - and said: 'We can only guarantee these rates on the first Pounds 15m invested.' But the 'guarantee' on this product applied only to the income, not the capital. The advertisement did contain the standard warning: 'The value of stock market investment may fall as well as rise, and investors may not get back the full amount originally invested.' In fact, the Scottish Widows product consisted of a combination of an annuity and a personal equity plan. For investors to receive all their capital back, the Pep would have to grow at 13 per cent per annum. That is a steep growth target. If the Pep failed to grow at all (by no means impossible, as many investors will have found in the past), the capital loss would be 40 per cent. Investors could have gleaned these facts by careful study of the product literature, but many may not have done so. The lesson is: do not rely on the word 'guarantee' in an advertisement. Read the small print. Some guaranteed products are relatively straightforward: Guaranteed income bonds (see also B for Bonds) are issued by insurance companies, pay a fixed income over a number of years, and repay your lump sum at the end of the period. This income is paid net of tax, and cannot be reclaimed by basic rate taxpayers. The backing for the guarantee comes from the Policyholders Protection Act, which will pay 90 per cent of the value of the fund if the company goes bust. Guaranteed growth bonds are essentially the same product, except that the income is rolled up within the bond and paid out at the end. Once one strays into the field of guaranteed equity products, things become much more complicated. Most last for a five-year period, at the end of which they will offer your money back or a return roughly equivalent to the rise in the FT-SE 100 Index, whichever is the greater. But the market is evolving all the time, with some products now offering an income facility, others giving the chance to lock in gains as they occur, and some allowing the investors to make early withdrawals. These products may well appeal to those cautious investors plunging into the equity markets for the first time. But they should remember two key points: You do not get something for nothing. The funds have to pay for the guarantee. Commonly, investors have to give up the yield on the market, which at 4-5 per cent is a significant return to lose. Most of these products are insurance bonds and have basic-rate tax deducted. Higher-rate taxpayers will face an extra charge and, unless they regularly pay capital gains tax, they should be better off with a low-charging indexed fund. In the case of the Business Expansion Scheme, companies have been stopped from describing themselves as guaranteed. But in practical terms, a guarantee is what is on offer from these schemes. These involved a BES company buying property from an institution which agrees to buy back the properties at a marginally higher price in five years' time. Because the investor gets tax relief on his initial investment (turning a Pounds 10,000 investment from a top-rate payer into Pounds 6,000), returns can be very attractive. Much depends, of course, on the creditworthiness of the institution concerned; if it is small and weak, it may not be able to buy back when required. That is why the regulators attacked the word 'guarantee'. But some schemes have third-party backing by major banks, and this 'guarantee' is what attracts investors. The BES is set to disappear at the end of this year, and one can expect the market to be flooded with schemes. Financial services marketing men have as much use for a clearance sale as any other salesman.</p>

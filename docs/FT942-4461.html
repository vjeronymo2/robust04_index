			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / International Company News: Eni savours the taste of freedom  -Franco Bernabe outlines plans to Robert Graham and Andrew Hill Eni, the Italian state oil concern, swung back into profit in 1993 after 18 months of restructuring. The switch to last year's L419bn (Dollars 259m) profit from a 1992 loss of L815bn was due to an improved industrial performance, cost savings and asset sales of L1,700bn. Mr Franco Bernabe, chief executive, said he anticipated a further strengthening of Eni's profits during the year. The group was on course for privatisation but the decision on how to proceed with the sell-off was in the hands of the Berlusconi government, he added. These are the first full year's accounts under Mr Bernabe's management. He has been at the helm during an exceptionally difficult period when Eni's activities have been placed under the microscope by anti-corruption magistrates. Last year saw the arrest on corruption charges of Mr Gabriele Cagliari, Eni's chairman, who committed suicide in prison, as well as the chief executives of all the main operating companies - Nuovo Pignone (gas turbines), Agip (oil and gas exploration/production), Saipem (pipelines) and Snam (gas marketing/distribution). Mr Bernabe observed drily: 'One of the reasons why we have been able to achieve better results is that we have been able to operate without political interference. We have been able to manage our business on commercial criteria.' In spite of difficult conditions and lower crude oil prices, gross earnings rose 8 per cent to a record L53,000bn from L49,800bn. Operating profits rose to L11,300bn from L9,800bn. A strong energy sector, which accounts for 90 per cent of activity, helped offset problems in Eni's chemicals and the heavily loss-making fertiliser operations. Mr Bernabe said much attention was devoted to slimming down Eni's base chemicals and fertilisers operations last year. The inheritance left by the costly merging of Eni's chemicals interests with those of Ferruzzi-Montedison in the now defunct Enimont, transformed into Enichem, had to be dealt with. 'We closed five large agro-chemical plants (in Italy); and we halved capacity, concentrating on plants at Ferrara and Ravenna,' he said. Restructuring of chemicals and fertilisers accounted for the bulk of the L1,400bn extraordinary costs (against the 1992 L1,200bn, adjusted for comparison). Much of the remainder covered closure of Eni's non-ferrous metals operations in Sardinia. The main cost item was payments for redundancy and early retirement. Eni's payroll dropped during the year to 106,000 from 124,000 and this year will fall to about 95,000. The principal among 59 asset sales was that of Nuovo Pignone to General Electric, with Eni retaining a 20 per cent stake. Mr Bernabe estimated asset sales would raise L5,800bn between 1992-96 with L1,000bn expected this year. This income has helped cover restructuring costs and hold down net debt. Mr Bernabe is particularly pleased that net debt has fallen by L300bn to L28,900bn after having risen by almost one third between 1989-92. 'We are now one year ahead of the agreements with the EU which envisaged a ceiling being fixed on debt at the level pertaining at the end of 1994.' Mr Bernabe has been weeding out the least efficient subsidiaries. As a result, 33 businesses have been closed in Italy and 40 overseas. Capital spending has been trimmed (L10,400bn against L10,700bn) with more emphasis on essential projects such as doubling the capacity of the pipeline bringing Algerian gas via Tunisia under the Mediterranean. Savings have been achieved by renegotiating some of Eni's overseas oil and gas operating contracts, notably in Egypt and Libya. Eni is concentrating energy strategy on exploration and production in China (especially the Tarim basin) and central Asian areas of the former Soviet Union, where the group has long cultivated good political contacts. Eni only became a public joint stock company, with the Treasury as sole shareholder, in August 1992. But since then Mr Bernabe has divided Eni into three groups - energy, grouped round Agip; chemicals; and other activities. 'My aim was to reduce Eni from being a loose conglomerate to concentrate on its core activity of energy,' he said. This has almost been achieved. Rothschilds recently completed a pre-privatisation valuation of the group. Mr Bernabe declined to say where this placed Eni among the international oil majors; but he admitted hydrocarbons reserves had traditionally been valued very conservatively and that Eni has an optimal 60/40 mix of oil-to-gas production. Both the Amato and Ciampi governments pledged to float Agip, as the initiation of Eni's privatisation, but this never materialised. Since Agip is the core operating company, Eni as the holding company has been fighting a discreet battle to ensure it does not end up as an empty shell. The precise fate of Eni as a holding company remains unclear and Mr Bernabe is enigmatic on the issue, clearly anxious to avoid prejudicing the Berlusconi government's opinion. The impression remains that Mr Bernabe is keen to serve under the new government and that decisions on privatisation will wait until after the sale of INA, the state insurance group which is to be privatised at the end of this month, and Stet, the telecoms holding company which could be sold in the autumn.  --------------------------------------- Eni  ---------------------------------------                             Lire bn                          1993     1992  --------------------------------------- Turnover                 53.0     49.8 Gross operating margin   11.3      9.8 Amortisation              6.4      6.4 Financial charges         2.5      2.6 Extraordinary costs       1.4      1.2 Net results               419     (815) Investment               10.4     10.7 Net financial debt       28.9     28.4 Employees (000)         106.4    124.0  ---------------------------------------</p>

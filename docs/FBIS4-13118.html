			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 17 Apr (MENA)--Mahmud al-'Arabi, chairman of  the General Federation of the Chambers of Commerce, has stated  that the Arab common market can withstand no delay, particularly  in view of world economic developments and the ongoing  competition to set up free trade areas and attract investment.    In a statement today, al-'Arabi pointed out that inter-Arab  trade today represents under 12 percent of collective Arab  foreign trade. He noted that Arab investments in the Arab world  are limited, although over $850 billion is being invested  elsewhere. He called for adopting positive measures to attract  part of the Arab capital being invested in foreign states.    Al-'Arabi pointed out that the necessary foundation for a  common Arab market exists but that it needs a set of measures to  be perfected. He explained that the required measures are to  facilitate the movement of goods and flow of trade among Arab  states, reduce shipping charges, eliminate customs barriers, and  encourage bilateral agreements as a basis for a common Arab  market.</p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] Legislative and Parliamentary Affairs Division. The  Majles met in open session yesterday chaired by Mr. 'Ali Akbar  Nateq-Nuri, and deputies Shoja', Kamyar, and Movahedi-Saveji,  from the cities of Bandar-e Enzeli, Urmia, and Tehran, gave  speeches. Then the Majles took up its agenda, and we direct the  attention of our respected readers to the detailed proceedings.  <H5>  'Abdol-Ghoffar Shoja', Deputy From Bandar-e Enzeli </H5>   If attention is given to the agricultural sector, it will  assuredly be the first sector to replace oil.    The first preagenda speaker at yesterday's open Majles  session was Shoja', deputy from Bandar-e Enzeli. During his  speech he offered congratulations and felicitations on the  anniversary of the Islamic revolution of Iran and the blessed  month of Ramazan. He added: Today America, as the leader of the  world's domineering nations, through the use of the measures it  has devised and promoted in the Security Council, considers the  United Nations to be its agent in creating the world's cultural,  economic, and military policy in the new world order. Through  the use of military tools and implements, it is thinking of  changing the geographic borders of nations and controlling the  world's strategic economic points, such as the oil-rich Persian  Gulf sheikhdoms, which submit to domination.    The speaker discussed the fact that America, despite its  claim to world leadership, is one of the world's most accursed  and vulnerable nations. He said: Economically, America is now  one of the world's most indebted nations, and is considered one  of the most insecure nations socially. The Islamic Republic of  Iran, despite 15 years of tricks by world imperialism, through  reliance on just Islamic government with the backing of its  great people, is in full control of all its current affairs and  its First and Second Five-Year Plans. Today it is one of the  most secure nations in the region and in the world in terms of  political, cultural, and economic independence.    Continuing, he said: Proper and committed Islamic  management,  serious supervision and control of executive affairs, timely and  appropriate encouragement, the exposure of cultural and economic  criminals, and dealing with them in an effective and  revolutionary way can be the basic factors in achieving full  independence for the government.    Careful supervision and attention to the nation's potential  resources can bring us closer to cultural independence without  dependence on foreign specialists, with a minimum of foreign  exchange. An example is the agricultural sector. A look it its  performance tables under the First Five-Year Plan will confirm  to government officials that if more attention is given to this  sector, it will assuredly be the first sector to replace oil  with agricultural and livestock exports, and it will provide all  the nation's domestic needs.    During his speech, the deputy from Bandar-e Enzeli discussed  the fact that the nation's forests and pastures are being  destroyed and that in previous years we had floods and heavy  losses because of the lack of plant cover in the vicinity of the  nation's cities and villages.    He called on officials to create suitable work environments  and to employ sincere and specialist manpower along with real  planning in order to be able to take basic and useful steps to  save the nation's natural resources.    He also criticized the dysfunctional situation with  fisheries  and fishermen in the northern part of the country in the Caspian  Sea. He said: Another problem in the area arises from the lack  of real and timely policymaking by officials of the Iran  Fisheries Organization, idle fishermen, and the excessive waste  of time for the region's Majles deputies and officials. Today,  in view of the shared use of the fish in the Caspian Sea by five  nations on its shores, waiting for fish in a launch cannot  answer the economic needs of the fishermen in the northern part  of the country.    Shoja' also said: The phenomenon of the rising waters of the  Caspian Sea in the last few years and the lack of persistent and  timely action on the part of the appropriate officials has  brought heavy losses to the people. Unfortunately, real steps  were not taken by the Plan and Budget Organization to provide  emergency government assistance, and this in itself calls for  serious questions and memos to the officials in charge. I,  therefore, request that quick attention be given to this  important matter.    The speaker discussed the liberation of the newly  independent  Central Asian nations, most of which are Muslim and can be in  close contact with Iran via the Caspian Sea. He said: Until now,  with the passage of several years, free trade has not taken  place between Iran and the other nations of the shores of the  Caspian Sea, and this in itself is considered a turning point in  trade and the spread of Islamic culture. Unfortunately, the  European nations, seeking to dominate the culture and economy of  the nations of the region, went into these countries more  quickly than we did and have made the most of them culturally  and economically.    At the end of his speech he asked the respected president of  the republic to give special attention to opening Bandar-e  Enzeli, this old port in the north, to free trade with the  nations of Central Asia.  <H5>  'Ali Kamyar, Deputy From Urmia </H5>   The Majles and the government must discuss economic  realities  with the people, and not keep saying that our situation is good.    The next speaker was Kamyar, deputy from Urmia. He thanked  the exalted leader for appointing a new chief of the Voice and  Vision organization. He said: His excellency has repeatedly  demonstrated that His Holiness, like the late Imam, considers  the Majles to be at the head of affairs and that he gives  special standing to the views of the Majles.    He then discussed the economic changes in society. He said:  The topic of the day in our country is the price of foreign  exchange, and everyone is analyzing the government's decisions  on this matter. However, an important point on which everyone  must focus is the failure to deal seriously with the economic  problems.    While we believe that world imperialism suffered the  greatest  damage with the establishment of the sacred Islamic government,  we must accept the fact that in response it will direct the  greatest pressure and aggression at us.    We all know that since the imposed war, by their own  admission they have been unable to deal with great Iran. Since  that time they have made a serious and firm decision to fight us  culturally, politically, and economically. It is appropriate to  understand the imperialist positions in this regard with  sufficient care. Their goals must be analyzed and we must resist  them as necessary.    He said that we must assess our strengths and weaknesses. He  said: The exalted leader sounded the alarm in the cultural  dimension two years ago, when he declared a general mobilization  against the cultural invasion, and everyone has at least  recognized this as an important danger.    The speaker continued: It must be accepted that our economic  situation today is the result of the failure to deal seriously  with economic issues. We have spoken about attention to  production, but we have been satisfied with talk. We have spoken  about low consumption, but in practice we faced growth in  consumption. We have spoken about agricultural growth, but every  day we witness agricultural malfunctions. We have spoken of the  need for nondependence on oil, but in practice we have done  nothing. We have repeated slogans about domestic goods, but our  markets are full of foreign goods. How effective have we been  reaching our goals to fight rural emigration, the growth in  unemployment and high prices that keep rising every day? We must  realize that the drop in the price of oil is the result of  several years of world imperialist policy, for which they  invested year after year with no other aim but to damage Islamic  Iran.    The speaker explained: If we wait too long to move, if we do  not awaken soon, if we do not make a serious decision to fight  back, criminal America will achieve the next in its series of  goals, which is to make us indifferent towards the sacred  principles of our Islamic government.    The Majles and the government must discuss economic  realities  with the people, and not keep saying that our situation is good.  Yes, our situation on the political issues is good, but on the  economic issues our situation is nothing to brag about. It is  true that we are in a better situation than our neighboring  countries, but this is not enough. Their situation is not  comparable to ours. We are independent and we must remain truly  independent. We must evaluate our own specific circumstances.    Continuing his remarks, the deputy from Urmia noted: Why  should we not tell the people that our nation's income is not as  high as our consumption? The nation's income is not enough to  meet its heavy expenses. You must realize that the nation's oil  revenues are several times less than they were 15 years ago, and  on the other hand our expenses are several times greater. Our  great nation must realize that the front line in our religious  crusade is now the battle against economic plots. They must  realize that the rise in the price of foreign exchange is not in  any way the desire of the government, and that the government  itself suffers the most from this.    The growth in the price of the dollar depends on the demand  for it. If we decrease our own need for foreign exchange, the  price of foreign exchange will automatically go down. We are  proud that in the year 1371 [21 March 1992-20 March 1993] we  imported $28 billion in goods. You must look at the statistics  and see what percentage of this was essential goods. When we  compete most heavily to buy foreign goods and when we all  believe that we must buy famous foreign brands when we buy  goods, then we can no longer expect domestic goods to develop  and to rise to acceptable standards of quality.    Kamyar added: Don't we realize that Japan, which is at the  highest economic level, reached this position by consuming its  own goods.    He mentioned pouring banking facilities into the commercial  sector, allocating high profits to the banking facilities  because the production sector cannot pay the profits, and  reducing the ability of the government banks to work with the  noncommercial sector on such practices as the payment of housing  allowances to teachers, and other things. The speaker then  discussed the high percentage of unemployment in the  municipality of Urmia and the stagnation of factories.  <H5>  'Ali Movahedi-Saveji, Deputy From Tehran </H5>   Why don't the Speaker's Council and the public relations  office defend the Majles against those who speak against it?    The final preagenda speaker was Movahedi-Saveji, deputy from  Tehran. During his speech he said: Today one of the issues the  imperialist world is trying to exaggerate is the issue of Salman  Rushdie and his The Satanic Verses. All the Satans,  the imperialist powers, and the enemies of Islam who have long  been hostile towards Islam and the Muslims are supporting a  filthy, spying, and mercenary individual who really wrote those  things for money.    The deputy from Tehran discussed the fact that His Holiness  the Imam's (peace be upon him) command concerning Salman Rushdie  is the command of Islam and absolutely cannot be changed. He  said: If Islam, the glorious Koran, and the divine verses in the  Koran can be changed, this command can also be changed. As for  the matter of carrying out this command, it must be done by  people who are undertaking this sacred defense of Islam and the  sanctity of prophecy with sacred intent for the sake of God.  This will actually be a great act of worship they will be  performing and it has nothing to do with a prize, money, or a  reward.    In the same regard the speaker added: Of course, for every  great Islamic and religious obligation, if those who spend money  for the sake of God or who put themselves in danger are killed,  they have performed a great act of worship and have been  martyred on the path of God. The matter of setting a prize or a  reward for killing such a filthy person may have something to do  with an individual or a group, but it has nothing to do with the  government of the Islamic Republic of Iran.    He also continued: Throughout this period the Majles has  neither studied nor approved any budget as a prize or reward for  killing such a filthy person. However, if in Iran or anywhere  else in the world any Muslim is able to spend his assets or  wealth to please God and eliminate this filthy person, there is  no problem with that either.    The deputy from Tehran discussed the pressuring and  slaughtering of the people of Lebanon, Palestine, and Bosnia and  Herzegovina. He said: I think that although Israel or America  are really behind all these crimes, savage killings, torture and  occupations of land, it is the hand of Zionism that has come out  of America's sleeve, both in the present and in the past. In  Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Zionists behind the Serbs are the  ones who are in the European and American governments. They are  trying to support these kinds of crimes financially and through  propaganda and provisions.    Movahedi-Saveji discussed the prestige and status of the  Majles. He said: I have a complaint against the respected  Speaker's Council and especially the Majles public relations  office. Why doesn't the Speaker's Council and especially the  Majles public relations office provide timely, appropriate,  rapid, and truthful statements defending the Majles against  those who speak against it, who are actually violating the  Constitution and slandering the Majles?    In the same regard the speaker added: A gentleman, competent  or not, had a position of responsibility in one of the  provinces. Finally he was fired and then he got another position  and comes and tells that our Constitution is defective because  it provides for interpellation of the president of the republic,  but the president of the republic does not have the right to  dissolve the Majles.  <H5>  Deputy From Jiroft's Letter to Newspapers Concerning Recent </H5> Statements by the Former Governor-General of Kerman    Although I have no intention of answering the issues raised  by the respected former governor-general of Kerman and informing  the dear and brave people of Iran, in general, and from Kerman  Province, specifically, about what happened among the majority  of the respected deputies from Kerman, because the honor of an  outstanding public figure, His Holiness Ayatollah  Hashemi-Rafsanjani, the beloved president of the republic,  requires that the sword of the pen remain in its sheath and that  I not upset him, God willing his excellency will permit me to  write at the appropriate opportunity about what happened during  and before the time I was a deputy and to set it before him as a  means of unburdening my heart and reducing my pain. However, I  expect the respected individuals in charge of the newspapers,  especially the influential newspapers RESALAT, KEYHAN, ETTELA'AT  and SALAM, to print the following material concerning what they  published about Mr. Mar'ashi, on the same pages and in the same  columns and under the same headlines, for the information of the  dear people.    1. The decision that he should not be a governor-general was  made by his excellency, the president of the republic.    2. Have the 12 years of his experience been wasted or not?  Who should answer?    3. If the government and the Majles are not together (God  forbid) who must know?    4. The respected deputies definitely know that the Fourth  Majles was formed with local sentiments and not on the basis of  national interests!!    5. It is no secret to anyone that the dissolution of the  Majles is a prerogative of the absolute vice regency of the  chief jurisconsult and that during the revisions and amendments  to the Constitution, His Holiness Imam Khamene'i did not permit  this to be added to the Constitution, but who should know if the  Constitution is defective or not?    6. Did the deputies from Kerman think the executive  apparatus  is like a corporation and that some of the officials were from  the Movali ol-Movahedin Institute and the Milad, Mahan, Kerman  Vehicle and other companies..., which is one of the remaining  distinctions of Mr. Mar'ashi [as published]?    The answer is known to those who are aware of the Koran and  the Book of God.    7. Why did many of the high-level officials of Kerman  Province refuse to obey the decision by the respected president  of the republic? Why did they abandon the ceremony of  introduction on 11/30/1372 [19 February 1994], and leave the  dear toiling and hard-working personnel in the office of the  president of the republic waiting? They did not listen to the  advice from the respected and dear Friday Imam of Kerman. They  forced the workers and personnel of some of the municipal  offices and other places to withdraw as if taking sanctuary  during the blessed month of fasting. It is not clear who will  answer for that!    8. Time has given the answer to "it is not yet too late."    9. You must ask the people of Jiroft about the "model  governor-general"!!    10. The crying of people "which did not come from emotional  women, but from men who were crying about all their limbs and  wounds" was observed by all the dear passengers who flew without  Mr. Mar'ashi after a long delay.    11. The servants of God, the respected deputies of Kerman,  Sirjan, Zarand, Kohnuj, and Baft, and the respected minister of  the interior...[as published]?    12. Perhaps they have started addressing a second-year  college student in economics as "engineer" and we did not know?    13. Unlucky 13! It definitely was not, is not and will not  be  unlucky. What firmer evidence that it is a blessed number can  there be than that after 12 years of successful service he is  still friendly, although it is difficult and it involves these  things!    14. God grant that this be the last press battle for the  respected former governor-general of Kerman and the deputy from  Jiroft.    With apologies to the sacred office of president of the  republic.    Zadsar Jirofti    Deputy from Jiroft  <H5>  Legislation </H5> <H5>  Bill To Change the Legal Status of the Large University </H5> Presses    The first item on the agenda at yesterday's open Majles  session was the report from the second consultation of the  Administrative and Employment Affairs Commission concerning the  Bill To Change the Legal Status of the Nation's Large University  Presses and Institutions of Higher Learning, for which Article 1  and its notes were approved by the deputies.    Article 1: All the nation's universities and institutions of  higher learning are authorized to operate their presses as  corporations.    Note 1: The wages and benefits of the workers in the  aforementioned companies will adhere to the Uniform Payments  System Law.    Note 2: For presses that are operated jointly by more than  one medical university or nonmedical university, the shares of  each university in the aforementioned press must be specified in  the charter.    Note 3: The charters for the presses of the universities  mentioned in this law whose status is changed to a corporation  will be prepared by the Ministry of Higher Education and the  Ministry of Health Care and Treatment, and will be approved by  the Council of Ministers after approval by the National  Administrative and Employment Affairs Organization.    Note 4: The presses covered by this law are required to  allocate at least 50 percent of their work capacity to the  printing of books and academic, educational, and research  journals and publications for the nation's universities and  institutes of higher education and research, and they must  operate in such a way that their printing affairs are not  disrupted or suspended.    Note 5: Any form of government aid to make up for losses is  prohibited and the profits made must be allocated to develop and  equip the same printing press.  <H5>  Bill on the Use of Weapons When Necessary by Police Agents </H5>   The second item on the agenda was the report from the first  consultation of the Councils and Domestic Affairs Commission  Concerning the Bill on the Use of Weapons When Necessary by  Police Agents, the general form of which was approved.    In view of the need to employ weapons by police officials in  the performance of their lawful responsibilities in sensitive  cases, which may sometimes lead to the death or injury of  suspects, and in view of the fact that appropriate legal  regulations have not been set exempting these kinds of agents  from penalties for the performance of their lawful  responsibilities and maintaining security in the cities, this  has disturbed agents in many places, while suspects have not  heeded warnings from agents because they are not authorized to  fire.    In events that have taken place in Mashhad and elsewhere,  agents did not have the authority to perform their missions at  borders, guard stations and roadside interrogations. This bill  permitting agents to use their weapons was therefore submitted  and its general form was approved by the commission. It is worth  saying that this bill must be studied in the second consultation.  <H5>  Rejection of Motion To Detach the National Grain </H5> Organization From the Ministry of Commerce and Attach It to the  Ministry of Agriculture    The final item on the agenda was the report from the first  consultation of the Administrative and Employment Affairs  Commission concerning the rejection of the Motion To Detach the  National Grain Organization From the Ministry of Commerce and  Attach it to the Ministry of Agriculture, continued  consideration of which was postponed to the next session.  <H5>  Majles Notes </H5> <H5>  Budget for Fighting the Cultural Invasion and Its </H5> Expenditures    Yesterday, in a conversation with RESALAT's parliamentary  correspondent, Dr. Kamran, a member of the Majles Islamic  Guidance and Art Commission, criticized the performance of the  nation's cultural organizations with regard to Note 55 of the  budget bill.    He said: Last year, on the initiative of the Majles and for  the purpose of confronting the enemy's cultural invasion, a  special budget was allocated in the form of Note 55 for the  purpose of implementing suitable programs in this regard. This  year the government also included this in its 1373 [21 March  1994 -20 March 1995] budget bill, but in view of most of the  members of the commission, the performance this year by the  organizations concerning this note was not positive.    In the year 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994], instead of  submitting appropriate programs for resisting the cultural  invasion and spending this budget on that, the relevant  organizations spent the money on the cultural programs they were  already carrying out, and this is in conflict with the main  goal. To answer the main message of Note 55, which is to carry  out appropriate programs, the cultural organizations used this  budget to buy organizational houses, to help the offices of some  of the Friday imams, to build offices in some parts of the  country and to complete some of their projects that were  half-complete. These things are in conflict with the goals of  this note.    We hope in the year 1373 the organizations will refrain from  spending the money in this budget on the current tasks and  day-to-day work of the organizations and will implement real  projects to fight the cultural invasion.    Continuing, he said: Of the 60 billion rials allocated this  year to fight the cultural invasion, about 80 percent was spent  on programs other than fighting the cultural invasion.    Dr. Kamran also added: The Plan and Budget Organization's  supervisory responsibility in this regard is not proper and  complete, and this organization must exercise greater  supervision to prevent this type of performance.  <H5>  Letter From a Number of Deputies Concerning the Printing of </H5> Bills    More than 80 Majles deputies sent a letter to the president  of the republic asking that government institutions no longer  publish bills and calendars at the beginning of the new year.    The full text of this letter is as follows:    To His Holiness Hojjat ol-Eslam val-Moslemin  Hashemi-Rafsanjani, respected president of the Islamic Republic  of Iran:    Peace be upon you,    With wishes for your excellency's success and acceptance, as  you know, every year the ministries, companies, banks, and  bodies of the Islamic revolution print large numbers of various  calendars and bills at heavy cost to the Muslim treasury, and  yet at the same time a large number of our students across the  country are unable to obtain stationery, shoes, and clothing for  the New Year's holidays. Therefore, we, a number of Majles  deputies, are asking your excellency to issue a firm order to  the organizations under the mantle of the government to refrain  from pointless expenditures of this kind and to spend the money  instead to procure essentials for needy students (for your  information the report published in RESALAT on 12/3/1372 [22  February 1994] is enclosed).</p>

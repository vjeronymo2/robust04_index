			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / World Trade News: Sir Leon Brittan urges new US administration to push for resolution of Uruguay Round SIR Leon Brittan, EC trade commissioner, yesterday urged the incoming US administration to join the Community in pressing for a rapid end to the Uruguay Round world trade talks, Andrew Hill reports from Brussels. 'Every week we don't have an agreement costs the world dear in money and jobs,' Sir Leon said, in his first public statement since taking over the European Commission trade portfolio. He wanted to meet Mr Mickey Kantor, the incoming US trade representative, as soon as possible to discuss strategy for concluding the talks. 'We have not reached agreement, but we have not wasted our time. We have injected new urgency into the process and have prepared the ground for a successful conclusion.' He hoped a deal could be submitted to the US Congress before the administration's current negotiating authority expired on March 2. But this authority could be extended and Sir Leon was careful yesterday not to set himself a specific deadline. 'An ambitious and constructive market-opening package, combined with sticking closely to the Dunkel text (draft conclusions prepared by Mr Arthur Dunkel, Gatt director-general), seems to me to provide the basis for a successful negotiation.' Sir Leon made clear that last year's controversial US-EC deal on agricultural subsidies could not possibly be reopened before provisional agreement had been reached with other Gatt members on the rest of the package.</p>

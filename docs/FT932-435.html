			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Oil companies look west to a wild frontier - A guarded optimism revealed by the latest batch of exploration licences WHEN MR Tim Eggar, energy minister, awarded the latest batch of oil exploration licences recently, he confirmed the trend for many companies to look for oil in some of the less traditional areas around UK waters. As the North Sea and the southern gas basin to the east of the country approach maturity - which means they have been so heavily explored, companies do not expect to make important discoveries there - the oil industry is focusing more of its exploration work in waters to the west and the south. This has seen companies planning to explore west of Shetland, closer to shore in the Irish channel, in Cardigan Bay and even in the south-western approaches. Mr Eggar is enthusiastic about this trend. 'I think we are on the verge of proving up a major new oil province which is significant for the future of the industry and UK oil production,' he said last week. The government has particularly strong hopes for the west-of-Shetland area, since several discoveries have been made there. 'It is yet more evidence that the UK continental shelf continues to yield great benefits for the economy,' Mr Eggar said. But Mr Eggar is probably more enthusiastic than some in the oil industry, who point to the enormous difficulties to be overcome before discoveries in these 'frontier' waters can be turned into commercial production. Mr Richard Hardman, exploration director at Amerada Hess which has made a discovery of around 200m barrels of oil west of Shetland, says he is optimistic but cautious. 'It's good to know there are big structures there and large potential reserves, but there is a huge challenge to find the technology and get it out at a reasonable cost.' If companies can find sizeable amounts of oil to exploit, these new provinces could prove extremely lucrative. The proposed changes to Petroleum Revenue Taxes abolish tax on new fields, whereas the rate for existing fields is 50 per cent. This gives an added incentive to explore frontier waters. Many of these 'new' areas have been explored before - the Clair field which is estimated to contain 3bn barrels of oil was discovered in the region west of Shetland 20 years ago. The field has never been exploited because of complex geological problems associated with it and the lack of technology for extracting the oil. Improvements in technology for appraising and exploiting oil discoveries could make some of these more marginal areas viable for the first time. Nevertheless, it could be well into the next century before oil starts flowing from the west of Shetland region, although the waters of Cardigan Bay and the Irish channel could yield oil sooner. However, companies hoping to find oil in Cardigan Bay must work within strict environmental conditions. The area is one of great natural beauty and has a resident population of bottlenose dolphins. Environmentalists are threatening to challenge at an EC level the government's award of licences in sensitive areas such as Cardigan Bay. They say the licences could infringe EC environmental directives. The drawbacks in the west-of-Shetland waters are more prosaic. The operating conditions are among the harshest in the world because of the depth of the water and the bad weather. The water west of Shetland can be up to 6,000 ft deep, whereas the deepest producing platform in the North Sea is in water 600 ft deep. The weather is bad and companies are unable to gather seismic data needed for evaluating oil discoveries in winter as they can in the North Sea. In addition, the lack of infrastructure adds to the cost of development and production. British Petroleum made an important discovery of between 250m and 500m barrels of oil west of Shetland in March, which could cost Pounds 2bn to develop. 'You might be able to use a floating production system to extract the oil and then collect it in tankers,' said Ms Caroline Noble, industry analyst at Wood MacKenzie in Edinburgh. 'But the weather is so bad, you probably wouldn't be able to use it all year round.' BP is conducting its largest-ever offshore seismic programme in waters west of Shetland at a cost of Pounds 9.4m in order to gather more data on its discovery and hopes to drill another well before the end of the year. Mr Hardman points out that Amerada drilled 15 wells in this area before it made a discovery. It lies in only 410 ft of water and should be easier to exploit, but Mr Hardman is still cautious. He was encouraged by the fast flow of oil from one well at a rate of 8,000 barrels a day. But Amerada plans to drill a couple more wells before it decides whether the discovery can be exploited commercially - that decision will be taken in 1995. A group of companies is looking again at the Clair discovery in the hope of establishing a development programme for that towards the end of the decade. But the complexity of the field means that only 150m barrels from the 3bn in place could be extracted. In spite of the enormous challenges to be overcome in these areas, the industry remains keen to search for oil which could be flowing well into the 21st century.</p>

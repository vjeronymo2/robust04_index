			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / Bosnia peace plan suffers new setbacks THE Bosnian peace process suffered serious reversals last night. Mediators told the Bosnian Serb leader, Mr Radovan Karadzic, that because of his intransigence he might as well go home, and Nato's top military official said the peace plan would be impossible to enforce in its present form. At a press conference in New York, Mr Karadzic announced he would leave last night but was willing to return if so requested by the mediators, Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen. He attempted to shift blame for the breakdown to the Bosnian president, Mr Alija Izetbegovic, who has refused to meet him face to face. Mr Vance, who is indisposed by an attack of bronchitis, and Lord Owen, both refrained from declaring the talks formally at an end. But their spokesman, Mr Fred Eckhard, relayed their feelings of frustration and deep pessimism. While Mr Izetbegovic continued to seek 'clarifications' of the peace plan, having indicated earlier he might sign the map of the 10 semi-autonomous provinces into which Bosnia would be divided, there was no prospect that Mr Karadzic would 'come round any time soon', Mr Eckhard told reporters. At the same time, Field Marshal Richard Vincent, chairman of Nato's military committee, told alliance ambassadors at a meeting in Brussels that conditions in Bosnia and lack of clarity in the plan meant it could not be enforced. 'He said the conditions in Bosnia are now so bad that Vance-Owen could not be implemented in its present form, from a military viewpoint,' a Nato diplomat said. Meanwhile, the US, Britain and France were reported to have abandoned for the time being a proposal before the UN Security Council to authorise the shooting down of aircraft violating the Bosnian no-fly zone. They were said to have acted in response to Russian objections, which earlier appeared to have been overcome by fixing a 14-day grace period for the resolution going into effect. Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, accused Serb forces of shelling a UN helicopter pad at Srebrenica when personnel were trying to evacuate wounded civilians. The evacuation was suspended after the shelling killed at least three people and injured six, including two Canadian soldiers. Under a deal worked out by French UN commander Gen Philippe Morillon, Serb leaders had authorised the airlift of Moslem sick and wounded from Srebrenica on condition that 44 Serbs were evacuated from Tuzla, a Moslem-held town in northern Bosnia. That evacuation was completed last night. In another development, the German coalition government agreed to ask the constitutional court to settle a dispute over whether German air crews can stay on board Nato Awacs reconnaissance aircraft over the Adriatic. The Free Democrats, the junior coalition party, insist that if the UN decides to enforce a no-fly zone over Bosnia, the Awacs' role will become combat-related and the German crews must be withdrawn.

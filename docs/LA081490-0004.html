			<p><P> August 14, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IRA MURDER OF BRITISH M.P. IAN GOW  </P> <P> It is unfortunate the British government has such a blind spot concerning the  question of Irish emancipation. The British would never stand for foreign  paratroopers occupying and patrolling London and the surrounding countryside,  yet they do that very thing in Belfast and Northern Ireland.  </P> <P> The latest IRA bombing of a senior British official, Ian Gow, has elicited a  predictable response from Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and members of  Parliament. The Irish Republicans are labeled "terrorists" and the British vow  never to give in or surrender to the Irish nationalists. Regrettably, the blood  bath will continue because, after 800 years of British domination, the Irish  will not quit, either.  </P> <P> The sun has set on the British Empire and the Irish will have their freedom.  </P> <P> EDWARD A. RUBALCAVA  </P> <P> Burbank  </P></p>

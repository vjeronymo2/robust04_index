			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / Revenue backs down on benefits THE INLAND Revenue is to pay up to Pounds 30m to people who have paid too much tax on benefits following a ruling in the Lords last year. It will also be forced to drop a number of disputed assessments worth many more millions of pounds with companies which have argued over the taxation of these benefits. The Revenue said yesterday it would refund employees who have paid tax based on more than the marginal cost of their in-house benefits - the additional costs to their employer of providing the benefit. It added that it was already making special arrangements for reimbursements to more than 100,000 British Rail and 40,000 London Transport employees who get subsidised travel, and was in discussions for similar settlements with airline staff. It is also believed to be holding talks with ferry operators and the Confederation of British Industry. Others who are eligible for refunds include teachers taxed while paying 15 per cent or more of a school's normal fees. Employees receiving professional services which do not require additional employees to perform or buying goods sold for at least the wholesale price will also benefit. The move reflects the ruling against the Revenue in the Lords last November in the case known as Pepper vs Hart, which concerned the tax assessed on the reduced rate tuition of a child of a teacher at Malvern College. The Revenue said it should be assessed on any reduced rate payment below the average cost. The Revenue stressed that ministers were considering a possible change in the law.</p>

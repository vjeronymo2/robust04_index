"I am sorry to hear this news. I am very  deeply sorry. I really don't approve of people who rejoice when  a political opponent gets into such a situation." Silvio  Berlusconi was talking during a long interview on GR-1 radio.  "I prefer to think positively," the Forza Italia leader said,  "if there has to be political competition, let it be honest  competition, in which everyone confronts each other on the basis  of party programs. I say this very sincerely, I do not like to  see these things happen." Berlusconi after expressing the wish  that the election campaign "become unpoisoned," dwelt on the  subject of the judiciary. "I'd like to think that one does not  find in the judiciary the strong politicization which many  believe to be there, and there are no judges and magistrates who  act in the service not only of the law, but in the service of an  ideology or even a political faction." "I believe that judges  and magistrates," Berlusconi added, "should feel that it is part  of their function to be above parties. If a judge becomes  politically biased, I believe that he is no longer a judge. My  wish is that they are conscious of the responsibility of their  function, and that all of them, in the north, in the south, even  if they have sympathies to the right, the left or the center,  realize that this is what is important."</p>

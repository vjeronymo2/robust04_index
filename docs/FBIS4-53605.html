			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 22 May Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] "The whites' society is a hunting society; they  would catch as much game as possible while it is there." That  was an allegory Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] General  Secretary Ichiro Ozawa used in describing his view of diplomatic  techniques used by European nations and the United States --  speaking at a lecture in Ofunato city on 21 May.    He reiterated his long-held view, saying: "Even if you asked  them to understand you better, that would be no use," and  insisted Japan should assert itself more. He talked tough,  declaring: "They [Japanese negotiators] would say there is no  way out for Japan, and then step back 50 steps or even 100 steps  when they could have taken only 10 steps back. They ought to  know that negotiations are deals."</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Johannes Ngcobo] </F>   [Text] The Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] yesterday declared  East Rand townships "no-go" areas for the Independent Electoral  Commission (IEC) and said commission head Judge Johann Kriegler  and commissioner Oscar Dhlomo were not welcomed anywhere near  hostels in the area.    The IEC yesterday called off a planned Operation Access  initiative in the East Rand, saying recent Inkatha activity was  cause for concern and that hostels there could prove too  volatile for political canvassing.    Police said the bodies of two unidentified men who had been  beaten and stabbed to death were found at the Denver hostel,  eastern Johannesburg, yesterday.    IEC spokesman Ghadija Vallie said the Operation Access  process, in which formal public debates were conducted between  party representatives under the auspices of the commission, had  been started by the IEC to enable parties to put their cases in  areas where canvassing would not be possible.    Inkatha Thokoza leader Abraham Mzizi and local indunas  [assistants to a chief] said the IEC had not consulted them  about a planned Operation Access visit.    Mzizi said the insinuation that hostels could prove volatile  was an insult to Inkatha's leadership in the East Rand. "The  IEC thinks indunas are inferior," said Mzizi.    Inkatha West Rand chairman Humphrey Ndlovu said Dhlomo -- a  former Inkatha general secretary -- and Kriegler were not  welcome near hostels on the East Rand.    "We would repeat what happened to Kriegler when he was at  Ulundi in Natal. Inkatha members are angry, and Zulus in  particular. If Kriegler wants to be hurt he should defy my  warning," said Ndlovu.    Inkatha members would grant the IEC access when Zulu King  Goodwill Zwelithini was granted sovereignty and called upon his  subjects to listen to the commission.    IEC spokesman Pieter Cronje said the IEC's visit to Ulundi  had managed to set up a working group between the commission and  the KwaZulu government.    He said the IEC message had always been that people were  free  to vote for parties of their choice and free not to vote in the  elections. "This freedom requires tolerance and acceptance that  one person's democratic freedom can be exercised only if he or  she allows everyone to the same," said Cronje.    The PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] region deputy  secretary-general Obed Bapela said his organisation was  disappointed that the IEC had cancelled yesterday's Operation  Access initiative.    He said Inkatha was in the minority in East Rand townships  and the party's leadership knew that some hostel residents  wanted to vote on April 27. It was unfortunate that hostel  residents would be prevented from voting.    "I call upon the IEC and Kriegler to start using the powers  given to them to ensure people on the East Rand go to the voting  stations on April 27," said Bapela.    Wits [Witwatersrand]-Vaal peace secretariat director Rupert  Lorimer said Ndlovu had been through a difficult period because  of the shootings in central Johannesburg on Monday. He hoped  cool heads would prevail.</p>

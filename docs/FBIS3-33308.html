			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] Buenos Aires LA PRENSA in Spanish on 30  January publishes on page 8 a 1700-word interview with former  Economy Minister Roberto Alemann by Ana Gerschenson. According  to Alemann, who is an economist, membership in NAFTA would not  be a good thing for Argentina. He asserts that the United States  wants his country to join the hemispheric trade bloc because  Argentina represents a large market for U.S. goods and because  Argentina does not have the problems that plague Mexico. Alemann  points to an unidentified study which states that the  incorporation of Argentina into NAFTA would mean, in present  worth, a $900 million increase in U.S. exports to Argentina as  opposed to an increase of less than $100 million in Argentine  exports to the United States.</p>

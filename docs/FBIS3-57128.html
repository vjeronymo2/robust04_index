He told TASS on Friday that a publication of the British  "GUARDIAN" newspaper which claimed that he had asked US  Ambassador in Russia Thomas Pickering to find a job for him in  an influential international organisation was a "provocation".    "I have not been in the US Embassy for several months and I  was not even present at the meeting with US President Bill  Clinton in Spaso House on December 14 although I was invited to  it", Fedorov said.    He added that he would now focus on his work as State Duma  deputy to draft lawbills boosting reforms.</p>

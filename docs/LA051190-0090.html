			<p><P> May 11, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SENATE OKS REDISTRICTING REFORM MEASURE;  </P> <P> POLITICS: THE PROPOSED CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT WOULD OVERHAUL THE METHOD OF  REDRAWING LEGISLATIVE AND CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS AFTER THE CENSUS.  </P> <P> In a move fraught with political overtones, the state Senate on Thursday  approved a proposed ballot measure to overhaul the way in which legislative and  congressional districts are redrawn after the present census.  </P> <P> A 28-4 bipartisan vote sent the constitutional amendment, sponsored by Sen.  Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward), to an uncertain fate in the Assembly.  </P> <P> Majority Democrats voted for the new plan, which could appear on the November  ballot, in hopes of undermining the chances of Propositions 118 and 119 in the  June 5 primary election.  </P> <P> Most Republicans, on the other hand, voted for it as a safety valve in case the  two propositions, which have broad GOP support, fail to pass. GOP lawmakers are  still smarting from what they consider an adverse 1982 reapportionment.  </P> <P> In brief, the constitutional amendment calls for the Legislature to draw a  redistricting plan and submit it to an independent 12-member citizens  commission for review and possible changes. The commission would hold at least  five public hearings on the plan.  </P> <P> The redistricting plan would go back to the Legislature, which could adopt or  rewrite it. It would become law if approved by a two-thirds vote of both  houses. But the governor's signature would not be required.  </P> <P> At least 40% of all districts would have to be "competitive" or winnable by  either a Democrat or a Republican.  </P> <P> Redistricting is a politically explosive task that the lawmakers accomplish  every decade after the federal census. The party in power usually tries to  maintain its majority status by drawing districts that will remain "safe" for  them until the next redistricting. The way district lines are redrawn can spell  either political survival or extinction for individual legislators.  </P> <P> "The non-productive trench warfare that we go through every decade needs to be  eliminated," Lockyer said.  </P> <P> Noting the growing use of the initiative process in recent years to overcome  legislative reluctance to act on crucial issues, Senate Democratic leader Barry  Keene of Benicia said, "Representative government is on trial in California,  and the outcome is uncertain.  </P> <P> "We are faced with the possibility of turning over the reins of public  policy-making to the initiative process. We've got to start thinking consensus  on more issues around here."  </P> <P> Senate Republican leader Ken Maddy of Fresno said the GOP suffered from the  1980 reapportionment, which he called the "worst gerrymandering" that he had  ever seen.  </P> <P> "We need to do something to increase fairness," Maddy said. "I suggest we move  this along and give the Speaker and the Assembly a chance to review it to see  if they also want fairness."  </P> <P> Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) last week called Propositions  118 and 119 "frauds" designed by Republicans to seize power from the Democrats.  </P> <P> Proposition 118 would require that any reapportionment plan be approved by  two-thirds votes of both houses of the Legislature, be signed by the governor  and ratified by the voters.  </P> <P> Proposition 119 would create an independent commission to draw new district  lines after the 1990 census is completed.  </P> <P> Ellen Elliott, a League of Women Voters official and strong supporter of  Proposition 119, said the Lockyer bill was no more than an attempt to undercut  support for the two ballot measures. She said lawmakers have had a decade since  the last redistricting to change the system.  </P> <P> "The thought of real reform is causing some movement" in the Legislature,  Elliot said.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Daniel M. Weintraub contributed to this story.  </P></p>

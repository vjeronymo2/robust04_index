			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Zamyatina] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 23 Jun (ITAR-TASS) -- Boris Yeltsin today  said a firm "no" to the ITAR-TASS correspondent's question about  whether the president intends to suspend the edict on fighting  banditry after the State Duma so recommended.    At the same time, in the words of Vyacheslav Kostikov, the  head of state's press secretary, the Russian president well  realizes that "there is a question" about violation of human  rights in the edict. That is why Boris Yeltsin 22 June sent a  letter to Sergey Kovalev, the Russian federation's  plenipotentiary for human rights, instructing him to supervise  implementation of the edict on protecting the population from  organized crime and promising his personal support in this.    In turn, Sergey Filatov, head of the russian president's  administration, told the ITAR-TASS correspondent: "We do not  intend to blindly follow the letter of the document, for it is  not a dogma. If we see that citizens' rights are being flouted  on the basis of the edict, we shall think about adjusting it."</p>

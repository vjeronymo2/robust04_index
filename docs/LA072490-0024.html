			<p><P> July 24, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUPERVISORS FACE INCREASED PRESSURE TO EXPAND BOARD;  </P> <P> REDISTRICTING: THE NUMBER OF SEATS HAS BECOME A CENTRAL ISSUE IN VOTING RIGHTS  LAWSUIT. THE SUIT ALLEGES THAT BOUNDARIES DRAWN IN 1981 PREVENTED THE ELECTION  OF A LATINO.  </P> <P> Two high-backed leather chairs sit unoccupied whenever the five members of the  Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors meet in chambers.  </P> <P> The chambers were equipped with extra chairs in 1961, Supervisor Kenneth Hahn  recalled, because officials expected that the governing body in the rapidly  growing county would be expanded someday.  </P> <P> But supervisors for years have resisted dilution of their power. And now that  Los Angeles is the most populous county in the country, each supervisor  represents about 1.7 million residents -- more than twice the population of San  Francisco.  </P> <P> Pressure, however, is mounting that could lead to board expansion -- the most  dramatic change in county government in more than a century.  </P> <P> A federal judge last month declared that the existing supervisorial districts  are illegal because they "impair the ability of Hispanics to elect a candidate  of their choice."  </P> <P> Two plaintiffs in the lawsuit hope to persuade the judge to order expansion of  the board to nine members.  </P> <P> And, although the board's conservative majority has opposed expansion,  conservative Supervisor Pete Schabarum recently indicated a willingness to  reconsider his position and possibly provide the swing vote to enlarge the  board by two seats.  </P> <P> The size of the Board of Supervisors has become a central issue in the voting  rights lawsuit filed in 1988 by the American Civil Liberties Union, the Mexican  American Legal Defense and Educational Fund and the U.S. Justice Department. It  alleges that the district boundaries drawn by the supervisors in 1981 prevented  a Latino from being elected to the board.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon ruled that the districts are "too large for  any one person to adequately represent." But he left it up to the supervisors  to decide whether to remedy discrimination by expanding the board or redrawing  the current five districts.  </P> <P> He is conducting hearings this week on a redistricting plan submitted by the  county.  </P> <P> How well the supervisors represent their huge districts has been debated since  expansion was first proposed in 1935.  </P> <P> The supervisors control a $10-billion budget and provide services to 8 1/2  million people -- more than the population of 42 states.  </P> <P> "The board's sweeping authority, the county's enormous budget, the supervisors'  $94,344 yearly salary, with chauffeur-driven county automobile and the  incumbent's significant job security, have prompted the observation that the  post of Los Angeles County supervisor is one of the most desirable political  positions in the country," a 1989 report by the California Commission on  Campaign Financing says.  </P> <P> However, most residents simply do not understand the role of county government,  the report says.  </P> <P> The job of a county supervisor in California has changed dramatically since  1912, when the primary task was "to assure the delivery of food to market by  maintaining key roads with snow clearance during the winter and watering down  the dirt roads in the dusty summer months," said Hahn, a supervisor since 1952.  </P> <P> Today, county government affects anyone who ends up in court, calls the  sheriff, uses a county hospital, spends the day at the beach, hears the  symphony at the county-run Music Center, applies for welfare, complains about  the accuracy of a supermarket scale, visits county-owned Marina del Rey or  relies on a county flood control channel for protection from heavy winter  rains.  </P> <P> The five-member board was created in 1852. During a three-year period in the  early 1880s, it was expanded to seven members. Since 1885, the board has  remained at five members, despite the county's enormous population growth and  the fact that it now covers 4,083 square miles.  </P> <P> In California, all 58 counties are governed by five-member boards except San  Francisco, which has 11 supervisors who run the state's only combined  city-county government.  </P> <P> But the Los Angeles City Council has 15 members, each representing 200,000  people.  </P> <P> And Cook County, Ill., the nation's second-largest county after Los Angeles  County, has 15 commissioners. Each represented 353,193 people in 1986, about  one-fifth as many as each Los Angeles County supervisor represented, according  to J. Morgan Kousser, a Caltech history professor who prepared a report for  plaintiffs in the current redistricting case.  </P> <P> Supervisor Mike Antonovich's 2,615-square-mile district, stretching from  Pasadena north to the Kern County line and west to Ventura County, is twice the  size of Rhode Island. Antonovich said that representing such a large district  is "no more difficult than the governor of California (being) able to govern  the state."  </P> <P> But the plaintiffs in the redistricting case have argued that the huge size of  the districts makes it difficult for candidates -- especially minorities and  women -- to challenge incumbent supervisors.  </P> <P> Judge Kenyon agreed, saying the five-district structure "clearly provides an  advantage to incumbents and requires significant financial expenditures to run  a successful campaign."  </P> <P> In a supervisorial race where a candidate must reach 500,000 voters,  substantial campaign funds must be raised, said Richard Fajardo, an attorney  for the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, a plaintiff in the  redistricting case.  </P> <P> "If a candidate for supervisor wanted to walk door to door and spend 10 minutes  with each constituent it would take him or her over 50 years," the report by  the California Commission on Campaign Financing says.  </P> <P> Expansion has been proposed since 1935, when a citizens commission said that a  15-member board would provide for better representation. But county voters  rejected expansion proposals in 1962 and 1976. Since 1980, the present board  has refused repeatedly to put the question back on the ballot. A proposal by  Hahn to put the issue before voters again in November will come before the  board July 31.  </P> <P> By expanding the board to nine members, Hahn said: "We can create a Hispanic  district, an African-American district and an Asian district that will give a  clear voice to these rapidly growing populations."  </P> <P> Supervisors can approve expansion, without voter approval, to settle the voting  rights case, according to county attorneys.  </P> <P> The board's three-member conservative majority of Antonovich, Deane Dana and  Pete Schabarum has publicly opposed expansion, contending that bigger is not  better. They have argued that an enlarged board, with perks and staff for each  of the additional supervisors, would increase taxpayer costs and would be less  efficient.  </P> <P> Schabarum was prepared to join Supervisors Ed Edelman and Hahn in expanding the  board to seven members to settle the redistricting case, the county said in  legal papers. But the proposal was rejected by the plaintiffs because they  claimed that the county plan fractured the Latino vote.  </P> <P> During a federal court hearing Monday, Schabarum testified that he was willing  to consider expansion under certain conditions, including a guarantee that the  county will not be required to pay for the plaintiffs' legal bills of more than  $2 million.  </P> <P> The two candidates seeking to succeed Schabarum, who is retiring, have vowed to  put a board expansion proposal before the voters regardless of the outcome of  the redistricting court case.  </P> <P> Richard B. Dixon, the county's chief administrative officer, said that more  supervisors would make the board more "ponderous and slow-moving."  </P> <P> While the county's population has grown, the power of supervisors has declined,  Dixon said.  </P> <P> He cited the increasing number of cities in the county, from 45 in 1954 to 87  today.  </P> <P> When a neighborhood becomes a city, Dixon said, "the Board of Supervisors loses  a great deal of its direct authority, loses land use planning, it loses the  determination of who provides the services and at what level. And the people  turn to their local city councilman."  </P> <P> Supervisors also lost power, Dixon said, because of 1978 voter approval of  Proposition 13, which took away their ability to raise property taxes.  </P> <P> The power of supervisors is also limited because the state mandates many  services that the county must provide, Dixon noted.  </P> <P> The supervisors still wield considerable power. They have some latitude in  deciding how much money goes to health and welfare programs or the sheriff.  They award hundreds of millions of dollars in county contracts.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Chen Youhua [7115 3731 5478]: ``MEI Institute 44 </F> Develops Three New Optoelectronic Couplers'']    [Summary] MEI Institute 44 recently completed development  of three new optoelectronic couplers: a high-speed/high-voltage  optoelectronic coupler, a Z-type optical coupler, and an  integrated-circuit-type optoelectronic coupler. Performance  indicators for these couplers meet or exceed those of the 6N136  and 6N137 commercial products made by the U.S. firm HP [Hewlett  Packard]. Moreover, these Institute 44 products use a black  ceramic metallized package, providing noticeably higher  reliability than comparable resin packages. The high-speed,  high-voltage optoelectronic coupler is used for driving TTL  signals, relays, pulse amplifiers, high-voltage signal  transmitters, and A/D converters. The Z-type optical coupler is  used in gyro accelerometers and also in computer-peripherals  interface circuits in office automation systems and in  isolated-signal transmission systems. The IC-type high-speed  optoelectronic coupler is oriented toward computer-based digital  communications systems and real-time control systems.</p>

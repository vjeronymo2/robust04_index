			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / New Nissan Micra on show THE NEW Nissan Micra has been put on show this week at the Northern Centre for Contemporary Art in Sunderland, in a display aimed at highlighting the artistic merits of the vehicle now rolling off the production line at the Nissan plant on the edge of the city, writes Chris Tighe. According to the exhibition organisers and Nissan the curves of butterfly wings and elephant trunks helped to inspire the lines of the Micra, currently European Car of the Year. Mr Mike Hill, director of the centre, said: 'In 1993 more people will look at a Micra than at a Monet. This exhibition, in a small way, acknowledges the place of Nissan in the life of Sunderland and the place of design in the lives of us all.' To help the public appreciate some hidden features of the Micra's design the centre is displaying a half model with clear door panels so its window mechanism can be admired. The Toyko Nissan team that designed the Micra was guided on European preferences by Lidewij Edelkoort, a Paris-based Dutchwoman and specialist adviser to the automotive industry on future design trends. The exhibition, Micra-Processes, runs until February 20. Admission is free.</p>

The figure marked an increase of 29 percent over the  previous  year, surpassing the national industrial growth rate.    Officials said it was the first time that Hainan's  industrial  output exceeded its agricultural yield.    Last year, Hainan saw a year-end industrial profit of 430  million yuan ($49.4 million), up 164 percent over the previous  year. Revenue collected in the sector hit 358 million yuan  ($41.15 million).    Meanwhile, 800 million yuan ($92 million) was invested  during  the year to modernize industrial production in the province.  The figure was 64 percent more than in 1992.    A meeting held to discuss industrial strategy, which  concluded last week, set a target of 30-percent growth for  industrial production in the new year.    Industrial firms are being encouraged to pump out a total of  12.1 billion yuan ($1.4 billion) in industry output in 1994.  The annual industrial profit is expected to grow by 24 percent  to hit 534 million yuan ($61.4 million) if that goal is reached.    Provincial officials have also vowed to reduce the number of  enterprises operating in the red by 40 this year. This would  represent a drop of 7.5 percent in the number of enterprises  running a deficit.</p>

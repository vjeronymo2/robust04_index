			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Survey of World Electricity (17): All eyes on Kuala Lumpur - Malaysia spearheads sell-offs in Asia BY the end of this month the first stage in the privatisation of Malaysia's state electricity board will be completed when 23 per cent of the company's shares begin trading on the Kuala Lumpur stock exchange. The minority flotation of the state-owned utility, Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB), is the biggest yet in Asia's developing countries, where most of the region's utilities are under state control. Malaysia's experiment in privatisation is being closely watched in view of widespread moves in the region to make the power sector operate more commercially. The TNB flotation involves the allocation of 625m of its 3bn shares to the private sector, with most of the shares going to domestic institutions, the public at large and to employees and a further 60m allocated to international investors. Baring Brothers, the UK merchant bank, lead managed the international offering. The offering was heavily oversubscribed and 'grey market' indications are that official share trading will see TNB shares hitting the market well above their offer price of MDollars 4.50 per share. The TNB flotation dates from the late 1980s when the Malaysian government began soliciting advice on how to privatise the utility, then known as the National Electricity Board (NEB). At that time, Mr Samy Vellu, the energy minister, hoped to float a majority of the shares, leaving the government as a minority shareholder, but retaining overall sovereignty for the utility through control of a so-called 'golden share'. That plan was abandoned given the complexity of trying to ensure a fair distribution of the shares among Malaysian institutions and the ethnic Malay, as opposed to the Chinese, public. It has been a cornerstone of Malaysian domestic policy since 1969 to broaden the Malay share of national corporate wealth to match the more commercially successful ethnic Chinese population. Malays comprise 58 per cent of the population of 18m, the Chinese and Indians comprising 33 per cent and 9 per cent respectively. Critics of the privatisation scheme argued that the TNB was almost too good to put on the marketplace. Malaysia is technically self-sufficient in energy with large gas and oil reserves and abundant hydroelectric potential. It now delivers piped gas to Singapore and is at the crossroads of a partially completed trans-ASEAN (Association of Southeast Nations) gas pipeline grid, extending from Thailand to Indonesia. With an installed capacity of 5,000 MW, Malaysia is not burdened by the population demands of Indonesia (180m, 9,000 MW) and its 1:3.5 ratio of kilowatts per head of population far exceeds the Asian average of 1:10 (the European average is roughly 1.5:1). The government has argued that injections of private capital were needed to improve the TNB's efficiency and meet the demands of new industry. It has set an ambitious target of adding a further 3,000 MW of new capacity to reach 7,834 MW by 1995, largely through the addition of hydroelectric and combined cycle power stations to the national grid. Mr Vellu recently declared that Malaysia wanted 'to become Asia's powerhouse'. The TNB's restructuring required it to be removed from governmental control. This necessitated its corporatisation, which took place in September 1990. After that, it was up to national and foreign bankers to put together an action plan that could be sold to the public. As well as an impressive boost in generating capacity, the TNB is predicting a sharp increase in profits. Last year, its turnover was MDollars 3.7bn, with after-tax profits of MDollars 501m. It foresees an after-tax profit rise to MDollars 820m this year and MDollars 969m in 1993. With electricity tariffs forecast to remain stable, this could mean a sell-off of some of the utility's assets, particularly thermal power stations which would be run by private operators. It is already in talks with Hopewell Holdings of Hong Kong to build a MDollars 4.6bn (Dollars 1.7bn) thermal power station on a build-operate-transfer basis. Hopewell would run the station for a specified number of years, recouping its installation costs from the sale of electricity into the TNB grid. To the alarm of some, TNB's long-range programme includes a closer examination of nuclear. When the flotation was first mooted, Mr. Vellu, commenting on the problems facing Britain's electricity privatisation, said: 'Thank goodness, we do not have nuclear.' Analysts suggest that this position really has not changed and that nuclear was put into the current flotation prospectus as a demonstration of the utility's technological prowess, rather than as an indicator of true, long-term intent. With the minority flotation just being completed, there are no immediate plans to float any more shares, though the TNB - with the government holding a golden share - may decide to do so later in the decade. The possibility that shareholders might have to fund a showpiece (and probably unnecessary) nuclear power station might provide a big disincentive to a further devolution of the utility.

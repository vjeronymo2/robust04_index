			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Our America Commentary" by Manolo Ortega; from the </F> "Evening Information Review" program]    [Text] More than 200 million Latin Americans live in  poverty, and the fact that nearly half of the region's  population lives under this condition has become the main  concern of leaders, presidents, and experts, and it is also the  main topic of any and all summits held within the region.  Nevertheless, there are indications this issue could be  downgraded in the next hemispheric summit convened by U.S.  President William Clinton, which, according to him, must review  inter-American relations in the post-Cold War era.    Despite the fact that the summit is filled with injustice  from the start because of the deliberate exclusion of Cuba, U.S.  Vice President Albert Gore, during his quick tour of Bolivia,  Argentina, and Brazil, took time to hold an equally quick  meeting with several of the likely participants at the  hemispheric summit to issue propaganda about the forum.    Most likely, poverty will be one topic discussed at the  summit. What cannot be certain, however, is whether participants  will find the formula to eradicate this distressing problem  because most of the region's presidents are unrelentingly  applying neoliberal economic programs imposed on them by  international banks, which have been a main creator of poverty,  deprivation, and violence.    Venezuelan Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli has said  poverty represents a new scourge within society, because it  poses security threats that cannot be fought with armies. He  stressed poverty is connected with hunger, terrorism, drug  trafficking, violence, and deprivation.    Aside from other personalities who have called attention to  poverty, such as the current OAS Secretary General Joao Baena  Soares, everyone is fully aware that there is a close  relationship between poverty and social violence. Nevertheless,  no one seems ready to tackle the problem.    Meanwhile, there are many bright individuals in Latin  America  who have not only realized that poverty is a national security  risk but who have called attention to the need for the region to  set up a new economic, political, and cultural integration  system as the only means of salvation in the face of an  increasingly competitive and isolationist world. Gradually,  strong integration programs, such as Mercosur [Common Market of  the South], the Andean Pact, and other treaties involving Latin  American and Caribbean nations, are being implemented. These  pacts are aimed at devising strategies to offset the ominous  effects of structural adjustment programs.    When the connection between poverty and violence is  discussed, the danger this poses to the stability of democratic  governments is also mentioned. This is particularly true when  one understands that 50 percent of the 200 million youngsters  under the age of 18 in Latin America are excluded from adequate  social, economic, and cultural benefits. In turn, this  undermines social equality and justice, which form the  groundwork of democracy. Therefore, the only way to avoid  allowing poverty to cause social catastrophe in Latin America is  by expediting integration, cooperation, and solidarity among our  peoples. The results may not be immediate, but in time they  will resolve the problems faced by the majority.</p>

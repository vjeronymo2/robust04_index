			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Major warns of tough spending curbs MR JOHN MAJOR urged Tories yesterday to face up to the prospect of tough public spending curbs and said the Conservatives' priority should be to listen to 'the heartbeat of Britain'. The prime minister told the Welsh Conservative conference that all public spending had to be reviewed because 'we are not prepared to see an ever-increasing tax burden' or to 'mortgage our children's future' through massive public borrowing. But he said many proposals for saving money might be discarded once examined. He said Tories had to go 'into the living-room of the three-bed semi-detached house' to 'understand what it is that people actually want. It is the answers to these questions which determine where the heartbeat of Britain lies'. Firstly people wanted jobs, 'to provide for their families and themselves'. People wanted medical care and financial support in their old age. He said he also wanted to encourage home ownership. He implicitly admitted to a failure of leadership - but not just by him - saying: 'It is when those fundamental securities seem uprooted that most people feel most threatened. And that, right the way across Europe from one end to the other, that's what has happened in recent years.' After a traumatic week he decided to abandon his prepared speech and speak from notes, to try to recapture the success of his 'soap box' performances during the general election campaign. He spent much of his speech defending Mr John Patten, the education secretary. He said too many children were failing at school on basic skills. What could they do? 'They cannot all be prime minister.' But the first priority of his speech was to convince Tory supporters that the government had a sense of direction. His self-deprecating jokes and unassuming delivery went down well with delegates in rain-drenched Llangollen.</p>

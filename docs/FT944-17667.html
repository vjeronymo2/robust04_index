			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / India puts priority onpower supply boost: Without it, ministers see their hopes of economic growth as doomed The electricity situation 'is rather grim and the prospects are also rather grim,' says Mr N K P Salve, India's power minister, talking about the country's power shortages. Right on cue, the lights and the air-conditioning in his ministry go off and do not come on again for the next half hour. Mr Salve puts a brave face on his discomfort in the sweltering heat, saying: 'If there is load-shedding it should be first in the ministry'. Better power management has so far this year spared Delhi the extended breakdowns it suffered in 1993 but sporadic cuts are just as frequent, even in the power minister's office. The only remedy is a sustained expansion of generating and transmission capacity, combined with more efficient use of the existing network. 'We must carry on with the struggle not only to increase capacity but improve transmission and distribution,' says Mr Salve, mopping the sweat from his brow. From the outset, Mr P V Narasimha Rao's government has put a high priority on improving power supplies. Ministers recognise that without electricity, hopes of promoting economic growth through liberalisation are doomed. Because of the squeeze on public spending, the government has welcomed private investment into the state-dominated industry. However, since power plants take years to plan and build, privately-funded plants are unlikely to make a significant contribution until the next century. Mr Salve says government planners in the early 1990s estimated that India would need to boost its generating capacity of 70,000MW by 48,000MW in 1992-97 to meet expected demand increases. Because of financial constraints, the target for the five years was cut to 30,500MW. Mr Salve says the total increase will now be less than 20,000MW, including 3,000MW of privately-owned extra capacity. Shortages in early 1997 will be about 14-15 per cent of normal requirements and 28-30 per cent of peak demand, about the same level as today, says Mr Salve. 'That's why I say the prospects are grim.' Mr Salve spends much of his time promoting private investment in the industry as the only way to secure the long-term future. His officials say binding contracts for the first four new private-sector schemes could be signed in the next few months. Potential investors, including foreign investors, say this is optimistic, given the hurdles they face. Partly the problems are due to bureaucratic barriers and partly to the fact that private-sector power projects are new in the developing world, so there are few precedents. Mr Salve says that despite liberalisation, investors still require 15-17 separate clearances. Also, responsibility for power is shared between Delhi and India's constituent states, some of which are slow to welcome private investors, he says. But, pointing out that 75 schemes have attracted interest from private investors, including foreign groups, Mr Salve adds: 'If companies are responding, it's because they find the Indian atmosphere congenial'. If increasing generating capacity is hard work, improving the efficiency of the transmission and distribution system is even more difficult, mainly because distribution is in the hands of the states. Mr Salve says state politicians have forced state electricity boards to operate 'imprudently', distributing free or low-cost power to farmers and other favoured consumers. 'This very pernicious system' has landed the electricity boards with mounting losses: Rs50bn (Pounds 1.03bn) in the year to March 1994, up from Rs34bn three years ago, before economic reforms began. But there is some progress. Late last year, state power ministers finally agreed to charge farmers a minimum of Rs0.50 a unit for electricity. This is still far below cost but establishes the principle that consumers pay. Mr Salve says 17 of the 26 state electricity boards have introduced the new charge. States which have yet to reform include Uttar Pradesh, the most populous, and Punjab, the largest agricultural producer. The position is so poor that the World Bank, the biggest foreign source of finance for Indian power, has this year withheld Dollars 750m (Pounds 500m) in planned loans because of the slowness in reforming electricity boards. Another of Mr Salve's headaches is that state electricity boards buy much of their power from the centrally-run National Thermal Power Corporation but consistently fail to pay their dues. The arrears, totalling Rs30bn, have become so alarming that Delhi took extreme action to recover some of the money - by taking it out of the grants paid by the government to state administrations. It was the third time Delhi has had to pre-empt funds since 1991. Mr Salve says: 'I hope it's the last time. We must accelerate the spread of economic reform into the states.'  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF THE STATE ELECTRICITY BOARDS, 1991-95 (Rs bn)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                 1991-92    1992-93   1993-94   1994-95  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Gross Subsidy on Sales               74         92       107       126 to agriculture                       59         74        83        96 to domestic consumers                13         16        21        27 inter-state                           2          2         2         3 Subventions received from    state governments                 20         19        21        21 Surplus generaged by    0sales to other sectors           22         26        37        44 Uncovered subsidies                   -         47        49        61 Memo Item Gross subsidy on sales (percentage of GDP)                 1.2        1.3      1.31       1.4  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Note: Subsidies are defined as the difference between tariffs that would enable the SEBs to cover their variable costs and tariffs actually charged.

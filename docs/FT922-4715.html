			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Siebe beats City hopes with Pounds 170m - Chief executive expected to step down before the year-end MR BARRIE Stephens, the chairman who led the transformation of Siebe, the engineering concern, into one of the world's leading controls manufacturers, is expected to step down as chief executive before the end of the year. Mr Stephens, while announcing a better-than-expected 7 per cent advance in pre-tax profits to Pounds 169.6m for the year to April 4, said yesterday that his successor was in place, but has not yet been named. Although Mr Stephens did not specify his future role, he said: 'If the board considers me to be of use then I'll stick around . . . If they think (not) then I'll go play golf.' City analysts dismissed the possibility that Mr Stephens - whose energetic management style and ruthlessness have been responsible for a six-year growth in sales from Pounds 370m to Pounds 1.6bn - would enjoy the latter alternative. It has been suggested that Mr Alan Yurko, head of the controls division  - which includes Foxboro, the US controls group purchased in 1990 - would become chief executive, with Mr Stephens staying on as non-executive chairman. The recovery of Foxboro, and of the US economy, were the key elements in last year's buoyant results. The market, which had been expecting a marginal rise to Pounds 160m, subsequently marked the shares up 12p to 739p at the close. US sales in the fourth quarter were especially buoyant, with parts of the controls division showing a 6 per cent advance on the previous year. Mr Stephens said they remained 'encouragingly ahead'. Sales for the group as a whole rose 10 per cent to Pounds 1.6bn. Siebe reduced staff by almost 2,400 people, bringing the total to 32,000. Redundancy costs and severance pay had sliced Pounds 6.6m from the bottom line, Mr Stephens said. He pointed out that Siebe remained on target for reducing gearing to the 'mid-50s' by August 1993. Cost-cutting and control of working capital had helped to cut gearing from 98.1 per cent to 78.8 per cent. Interest payments, however, rose from Pounds 48.9m to Pounds 63.5m due to the inclusion of Foxboro for a full 12 months, compared with seven months last time. Mr Stephens was unapologetic about Siebe's practice of capitalising intangible assets - mainly software development. 'You have to attribute to the balance sheet the value of intellectual property,' he said. The 'intelligent' controls market was the way of the future, he added. 'If you are not intelligent you might as well stay home and die.' During the year, Siebe capitalised Pounds 27m of software development, while depreciation charges came to Pounds 24m. The controls division increased pre-tax profits from Pounds 93.6m to Pounds 117.5m, on sales Pounds 172.6m ahead at Pounds 1.1bn. Foxboro contributed Pounds 13m (Pounds 500,000) in profits after all financing obligations, Mr Stephens said, while gross margins there had risen by 10 percentage points to 45 per cent. The costs of restructuring the US company totalled Pounds 29.6m (Pounds 39.9m) and were expected to come to about Pounds 15m this year. Compressed air saw taxable profits halve from Pounds 24.3m to Pounds 12.1m. The division had been the 'most ravaged by recession' with its main customers in the severely depressed mining industry. Specialist mechanical engineering saw pre-tax profits fall by Pounds 1.8m to Pounds 11.9m, while safety and life support fell from Pounds 25m to Pounds 23.4m pre-tax. Property profits rose from Pounds 2.5m to Pounds 4.7m. Earnings per share rose from 46.1p to 47.6p. The final dividend is increased to 12.1p for an 18.15p (16.5p) total. See Lex</p>

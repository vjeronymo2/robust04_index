			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 6 KYODO -- The Finance Ministry has not  yet received any instructions over possible economic sanctions  against North Korea, a senior ministry official said Monday.    But the ministry already has "know-how" to follow any U.N.  Security Council resolutions on stopping bank remittance, as it  did toward Iraq during the Persian Gulf war in 1990, Vice  Finance Minister Jiro Saito told a regular news meeting.    Saito otherwise refused to comment, saying, "things have yet  not progressed as far as imposing economic sanctions."</p>

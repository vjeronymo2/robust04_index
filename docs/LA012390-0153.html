			<p><P> January 23, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WOMAN IN BARRY'S ARREST TESTIFIES;  </P> <P> EX-MODEL WHO LURED MAYOR TO HOTEL TALKS TO GRAND JURY  </P> <P> The one-time model who helped lure Mayor Marion Barry to a Washington hotel and  allegedly provided him with cocaine in a "sting" operation appeared today  before a federal grand jury investigating Barry's activities.  </P> <P> Rasheeda Moore, who reportedly lives in Burbank, Calif., with her husband and  three children, was brought by police and FBI agents to U.S. District Court for  secret testimony behind closed doors.  </P> <P> Moore, who sources said called Barry to the hotel room where he was arrested  Thursday night, spent about 2 1/2 hours in the grand jury room after entering  the courthouse under tight security. She said nothing as she entered or left  the building through the back door.  </P> <P> Moore, 38, presumably gave the grand jury details about how she invited Barry  to Room 727 of the downtown Vista International Hotel, allegedly sold him crack  cocaine and then watched him smoke it.  </P> <P> "You set me up!" an angry Barry reportedly said to Moore when police and FBI  agents burst into the hotel room and arrested him. Secret cameras had filmed  the liaison, the FBI said.  </P> <P> Her testimony to the grand jury could lead to filing of other criminal charges  against Barry in addition to the misdemeanor charge that Barry already faces  for possession of crack, a potent and highly addictive smokeable form of  cocaine.  </P> <P> Barry's defense lawyer has said he would plead not guilty to the charge, which  carries a maximum one-year prison term and a $100,000 fine, and that he will  demand a jury trial.  </P> <P> Moore is in the protective custody of the FBI.  </P> <P> Also today, Barry's press secretary said that he "sounded fine" when she spoke  to him by telephone at the Hanley-Hazelden drug and alcohol treatment facility  in West Palm Beach, Fla., that he entered on Monday.  </P> <P> Spokeswoman Lurma Rackley said she did not know how long Barry would be in the  drug and alcohol treatment center where she said "he's being treated for  alcoholism."  </P> <P> The center normally has a monthlong program for treatment. It has often treated  celebrities, including Kitty Dukakis, wife of Massachusetts Gov. Michael S.  Dukakis, for diet pill addiction in 1982.  </P></p>

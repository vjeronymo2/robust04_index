			<p>BFN     [Text] Tirana, May 4 (ATA) -- At the request of the Union  of the Independent Trade Unions of Albania (UITUA), a meeting  was held May 3 between the UITUA representatives and the  government, headed by Premier Aleksander Meksi; the minister of  labour, emigration and social assistance, Dashamir Shehu; the  minister of mining and energy resources, Abdyl Xhaja; and other  government members. The participants in the meeting agreed that  the issuing of a law or agreement on indexation of inflation be  sanctioned until the end of May also setting the deadline it  will come to force. As regards privatization, by the end of  May, the government promised to issue a decision which will also  include the demands of the independent trade unions. They also  agreed that the trade unions be familiarized with the procedures  of preparing the vouchers and that legislation regarding this  question be completed within the first six months to be  submitted to the parliament for approval.    Mr. Meksi said that the price rise in the electric energy is  an indispensability of the reform, but, taking into  consideration the demands of the Independent Trade Unions for  compensation for the electric energy, he will once again study  the financial possibilities especially in the northeastern zone.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Foreign Ministry issued a statement clarifying  an accusation about Thailand supporting the Khmer Rouge. The  statement says that Thailand would like to reject the accusation  because Thailand has a firm policy of recognizing the elected  Cambodian Government and noninterference in Cambodia's internal  affairs by not providing any assistance to the Khmer Rouge. The  Cambodian side should send evidence to the Thai side if it has  any evidence to support the accusation. The Thai side is ready  to take appropriate action in this regard. If Cambodia cannot  solve its internal problems and accuses another country of  supporting any particular faction, it is incorrect and  inappropriate.</p>

			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / Rise in Pergau costs queried Baroness Chalker, minister for overseas development, yesterday said that she had opposed government funding of the Malaysian Pergau dam project on economic grounds. She also told the Commons foreign affairs committee that it was unusual for the cost of a project to rise by as much as the Pergau dam had in such a short time. Under persistent questioning over the alleged link between the aid for the dam and a Pounds 1bn arms deal, she conceded that it might be more accurate to describe the two policies 'as independent rather than no-linkage'. Lady Chalker's evidence came as former minister Lord Younger said he alone had taken the decision to offer aid as part of an arms sale in the protocol. Speaking on ITN, however, he made clear that he did so on behalf of the government. 'I was secretary of state for defence not just an office boy,' he said. It is understood that Lord Younger's intervention follows two telephone conversations with Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary. When Mr Hurd appeared before the foreign affairs committee on Wednesday he appeared to blame Lord Younger for the 'incorrect entanglement' of aid and arms between March and June 1988. Lady Chalker told the committee: 'The minute George Younger got back to London (after signing the protocol linking aid to arms) other members of the government set about making sure that the protocol was withdrawn.' However, she argued: 'At the same time it was in Britain's interests to continue to offer defence equipment to Malaysia.' She added: 'I advised Douglas Hurd that from my perspective we should not proceed with the project. The foreign secretary took a different view.' She said Mr Hurd had informed Lady Thatcher, the then prime minister, that she opposed the project on economic grounds. It was only 'marginally economic' at the 1988 original contract estimate of Pounds 316m. Sixteen days later the UK consortium, led by Trafalgar House and BICC, increased their estimate to Pounds 397m, which by 1991 rose to Pounds 417m. Lady Chalker said: 'It was extremely unfortunate that they (the consortium) did not clarify the elements which were excluded from the first estimate. What was going on it is difficult to say.' She agreed with Mr Michael Jopling, a former minister, that appraisal of the dam project was conducted in two days because Baroness Thatcher wanted it completed quickly. 'A more substantial appraisal would have been more desirable,' she said.</p>

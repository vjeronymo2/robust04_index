			<p><P> January 31, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ELKS LODGE'S 1ST BLACK MEMBER SAYS HE DID NOT SET OUT TO BREAK COLOR BAR  </P> <P> The first black to join the Van Nuys Elks Lodge after a months-long controversy  over its racial policies said he took the lodge's secret initiation rites  Tuesday because he wants to continue watching televised sports there, but as a  member, not as a guest.  </P> <P> Ben Harvey, 41, of Pacoima said he did not intentionally set out to break a  color barrier when he told lodge members late last year that he wanted to  become a member after watching about seven football games on Monday nights with  friends at the lodge's bar on Friar Street.  </P> <P> "I asked, 'What do you have to do to be a part of this, to get a card to get in  anytime you want?' " Harvey said.  </P> <P> Harvey's casual interest in joining the lodge coincided with a state  investigation into allegations of racism in the fraternal organization.  </P> <P> The state attorney general's office has been investigating whether the lodge  violated state civil rights laws in September by twice rejecting two blacks who  applied for membership.  </P> <P> Lodge spokesman Dan Davis said at the time that the two men were not turned  down because of their race, but because other members -- who must approve  applicants by a two-thirds vote -- resented the involvement of state Sen. Alan  Robbins (D-Tarzana), who nominated them.  </P> <P> Last week, the lodge accepted Harvey, who was nominated by the club's exalted  ruler, George Aguilar, at a closed meeting, with 59 of its 300 members voting.  The lodge did not reveal the result of the vote.  </P> <P> "I'm sure when the vote went down, there were some 'nos,' " Harvey said. "But  my philosophy is you treat people the way you want to be treated -- with  respect."  </P> <P> During the fall football season, he frequently watched games on television in  the club's bar as Aguilar's guest, Harvey said.  </P> <P> Tuesday, Harvey, a laminating plant manager, became the first black recipient  of the lodge's membership badge -- a gold Elk lapel pin -- after swearing  eternal brotherhood with fellow members in a secret initiation ceremony.  </P> <P> "You don't have to ride a goat or anything like that to get in," said Steve  Duchscherer, a past exalted ruler of the Van Nuys lodge. "It's a very nice,  quiet ceremony."  </P> <P> As a member of the Benevolent and Protective Order of the Elks, as the  organization is officially known, Harvey is entitled to visit lodges  nationwide, including the opulent Long Beach club, which boasts an "endless"  bar, actually an illusion created by mirrors.  </P> <P> Harvey also must observe a hallowed tradition of the 126-year-old club, said a  member who asked not to be identified. Every evening at 11, Elks members are  supposed to take a moment to silently remember departed Elks. If they happen to  be in an Elks club, a bell will strike 11 times and members are supposed to  join hands in remembrance of their deceased brethren, the Elk said.  </P> <P> "I'll do whatever the members do," Harvey said Tuesday in his split-level,  four-bedroom brown stucco house on a hillside overlooking the San Fernando  Valley.  </P> <P> Harvey, a long-distance runner, has a crossed right eye from a childhood  accident.  </P> <P> He was raised in Memphis, where his mother worked as a maid, and remembers  segregated schools and public facilities. "You couldn't go in certain doors or  sit in certain places."  </P> <P> He said he feels that discrimination still "happens every day, but that's their  problem. We work hard and contribute to society. If they don't like us, that's  too bad."  </P> <P> He said he and his wife, Therese, attended a fund-raiser at the lodge last  month.  </P> <P> "As the only black people there, they sure looked at us," Therese said. "But as  the night went on, they started coming over and talking to us, and I think they  decided we're not so bad after all."  </P></p>

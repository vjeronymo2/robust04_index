			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Hemi Shalev] </F>   [Text] About half the public believes Israel should use  only limited force or even abstain from using force to put down  riots in the territories, according to a poll published this  week by Bar-Ilan University's Institute for Strategic Studies.    About one-third of the public does not know whether to  support or oppose the agreement between Israel and the PLO,  while one-half does not believe the agreement will lead to  comprehensive peace with the Arab countries. According to the  poll commissioned last month from Modi'in Ezrahi, 60 percent of  the public support negotiations with the PLO, which represents  only a 46-percent rise since last March.    The poll further shows that 78 percent are either opposed to  any withdrawal or agree to a very limited withdrawal from the  Golan Heights. On the other hand, 16 percent support a partial  withdrawal, and only 4 percent advocate a full withdrawal.    As for voting trends, the poll points to a drop in support  for Labor and Meretz and a surge in the strength of Likud and  Tzomet. Labor would attain 26 percent of the vote if elections  were held today (compared with 35 percent in the last election),  Likud would rise from 25 to 30 percent, Meretz would drop from  9.5 to 5.6 percent, and Tzomet would rise from 6.35 to 9.78  percent.    As for the agreement with the PLO, the poll shows that 14  percent support it very much, 21.6 percent support it, 11  percent oppose it, and 26 percent oppose it very much. Some 27  percent said they both support and oppose the agreement.</p>

			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Chrysler Mr Kirk Kerkorian's call for higher dividends and an end to anti-takeover defences at Chrysler is unlikely to presage a bid for the company. Mr Kerkorian's move seems motivated less by the desire to flush out a predator than by frustration with the valuation accorded the group's stock. Despite its earnings recovery, Chrysler's shares have performed poorly this year and now stand at only four to five times expected earnings for 1995. This p/e ratio is about a third of the average for US companies - too low even allowing for the highly cyclical nature of the automotive industry. At issue is the way in which the group's management disposes of the plentiful cash generated as the industry nears its peak. Mr Kerkorian would like more to be transferred to the company's owners. Dividends have yet to return to the level of the late 1980s. Insofar as pressure from Mr Kerkorian induces a more generous pay-out policy, perhaps accompanied by a share buy-back, it is to be welcomed by investors. The management's desire to husband cash is prudent. But with Dollars 6.6bn of liquid assets at the end of the third quarter the company can afford to be more generous. Mr Kerkorian is also right to criticise the bid defences in place at Chrysler. Given its record, Chrysler's management need have nothing to fear from a bid  -and should have no qualms about dispensing with 'poison-pill' defences.</p>

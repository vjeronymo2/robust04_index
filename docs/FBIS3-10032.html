"They are moving fast because they know that if  they do not succeed in reversing the actions they criticize,  they will have lost too much ground as the result of internal  and external circumstances," Gomez said.    During an interview with PRENSA LATINA, Gomez, who is also  director of AREITO magazine, said there is a big tug-of-war  between opposing sides of the Cuban community in the United  States.    "Those who favor better relations with Cuba have gained  ground since Washington lifted the economic sanctions against  Vietnam and because of the pro-Cuba activities of an increasing  number of U.S. citizens," he added.    Gomez emphasized the work of the U.S. ecumenical  organization  Pastors for Peace, which in 1992 and 1993 breached the blockade  by taking humanitarian aid from the continental United States to  Cuba, clearly violating the embargo. "Pastors for Peace are  again gathering goods for the island. Unlike previous years,  this time the authorities are giving them plenty of leeway. I  think this is an encouraging sign," Gomez added.    The director of AREITO also mentioned the effort of New York  Democrat Congressman Charles Rangel, who on 17 March will  present Congress with a proposal to call off the embargo.    Gomez believes that, in view of the situation, the most  recalcitrant exiles must make a show of force or risk losing the  traditional government support they have enjoyed since the  triumph of the Cuban revolution in 1959.    "That is why they organized an event on Capitol Hill in  Washington on Thursday. They rally was attended by only 1,000  people despite the presence of Robert Torricelli, the  congressman who succeeded in having the embargo tightened in  1992."    "The recalcitrant ones expected to rally at least 10,000  people. They rented planes and buses in Miami, New Jersey, and  other cities, but the event was a political failure. The  hard-liners know it, and they are worried," he said.    Gomez recalled that Cuban community hard-liners rallied  50,000 people in Miami in October for a similar event. "Of  course, the fact that only 1,000 people rallied in Washington  does not indicate an absolute loss of rallying power. Moving  people a couple of blocks away from home is not the same as  moving them thousands of kilometers away. Nevertheless, the  refusal to make the effort that all this entails is an  indication of little interest in the activity," he said.    Gomez is in Mexico City to participate in an International  Book Fair, where he will lecture on the book Cuba In the  Face of Cynical Logic [Cuba Ante La Razon Cinica] written  by Heinz Dietrich Steffan.</p>

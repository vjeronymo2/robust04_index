			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / London Markets: Olympia &amp; York casts a long shadow A BRIGHT flashing light in the eastern evening sky has been puzzling Londoners for some time. Was it a rising star? Did it signify a birth? Now we know. It was a warning beacon. By day the source of the glow can be seen through the city haze. It is the tower at Canary Wharf, the Pounds 3bn docklands development, part of the Olympia &amp; York Developments empire, whose main holding companies in Canada and the US have filed for protection from creditors. Although Canary Wharf is still, in theory, solvent, the filing cast a longer shadow over the City than that thrown by the giant office block on the Isle of Dogs. O &amp; Y's problems were so well known that the immediate effect of the news on the market was not as severe as might be supposed from the the world's biggest ever bankruptcy. Bank and property shares fell, but not a lot. Shares in Barclays, the UK bank with the greatest exposure to O &amp; Y, fell 6p to 280p yesterday. But the effect on sentiment in the next few weeks may be deeper if Canary Wharf goes into administration. After the previous week's enthusiasm which took the FT-SE 100 index to a record high, the market has been tested by a series of poor corporate and economic figures. The FT-SE 100's peak for the week was on Monday morning when it touched 2744.5. But by Thursday it slipped below the 2700 level again, and it closed yesterday at 2682.6, down 43.1 over the week. This week the market suffered its first significant setback since the election, a correction dismissed by the bulls as 'blowing the froth off the market'. Given that the post-election rise topped 300 points, a 40-odd point retreat is not much of a fall. On the positive side, turnover in the market, which had been high as the market rose, was minimal yesterday. This suggests that there is not much real selling. One of the main foundations of the market's recent rise has been the idea that the UK has entered an era of low inflation, indeed that the miracle of simultaneous low inflation and economic growth was about to be performed. That view was somewhat dented this week by the latest economic statistics. The market is fairly callous about unemployment, which in any case is a lagging measure. But a sharper than expected rise of 42,600 in April reported this week at the same time as an increase in average earnings of 7.5 per cent in the year to March, suggests that there are still inflationary pressures in the system in spite of the weak economy. Friday's retail price index - showing a year on year rise of 4.3 per cent in April, up from 4 per cent in March - was not as high as some commentators had feared. But as the chart shows, the Tory government has not been conspicuously successful in getting unemployment to come down without inflation rising. Or vice versa. The question is whether sterling's entry to the ERM will have changed expectations sufficiently and it is one which will be asked repeatedly in the months ahead. However, on Monday BTR the conglomerate, took the same view as Hanson did at the end of last week, that it was time to sell. BTR sold its 4.1 per cent stake in Pilkington, the glass group, to Smith New Court, the broker. But, as with Hanson's ICI stake last week, the subsequent placing did not meet with overwhelming demand. This may put off some companies which were expected to be flooding the market with rights issues. But the example of BICC, the cables group, this week is more encouraging. Its Pounds 154m issue - not yet a big mouthful for the market but the largest since the election - was well received and BICC's shares rose, partly as it promised to hold the dividend, although it was not covered last year. Corporate financiers are expecting further rights issues to be of a 'restructuring' nature as companies look to replace bank debt with equity. The O &amp; Y experience will no doubt concentrate minds, while WPP, the advertising group, this week announced the terms of the refinancing package it is putting to banks. The relative lack of rights issues has been matched by a similar scarcity of big bids. There had been hopes that the positive election result would lead to a stream of takeovers, but so far few have materialised. One such is the Lloyds bid for Midland, which was still carefully referred to as the 'possible offer' in a detailed letter sent by the aggressor to Midland shareholders yesterday pressing its case. Among those bids that have appeared, TI, the engineering group, this week declared its Pounds 500m-plus offer for Dowty final, signalling its expectation to win hands down without having to increase it. Robert Bosch, the German conglomerate, tied up its agreed bid for Worcester Group, the central heating boiler maker. Yesterday Greene King started the long-awaited shake up of the regional brewing industry with a Pounds 100m-plus bid for Morland. On balance, the guide to the progress of recession coming from companies was still gloomy this week. Chairmen have been telling annual meetings that there are few signs of an upturn in the early months of the current year. Even the giants of the retail world, Marks and Spencer and J Sainsbury, which each reported annual results this week, cannot see newly-confident consumers rushing to their shops. Though both increased profits, and Sainsbury overtook M and S as the most profitable UK retailer, the company put that down to its own efforts rather than to an improvement in trade. Further away from the supposed consumer-led recovery, Hanson, the Anglo-American conglomerate, suffered a Pounds 100m fall in first half profits to Pounds 488m and looks set to lose its record of unbroken earnings per share growth.</p>

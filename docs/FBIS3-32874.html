			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso </F> by Nelia Marquez in Brasilia; date not given]    [Text] [Marquez] Although Provisional Measures 404 and 407  -- which are important for the stabilization plan -- were not  approved, will it be possible to create the URV [Real Value  Unit] after Carnival, as you announced?    [Cardoso] I have always said that creation of the URV will  be  possible only if the fiscal adjustment is guaranteed. If the  adjustment is not approved, the URV will be delayed.    [Marquez] Following the implementation of the URV, when will  a new currency be created?    [Cardoso] It is impossible to set deadlines. If we set a  date, we run the risk of a repeat of what occurred last December  when entrepreneurs adjusted prices either in self defense or to  attack the economic plan. Support for the URV must be  voluntary, precisely to avoid that type of problem.    [Marquez] Do you not consider it very unfair on workers to  convert salaries into URV's by an average value, while prices --  especially utility rates -- will be converted by the value in  force on the date of conversion?    [Cardoso] Nothing has been decided yet. We have said that  there will be a negotiation process. Stories about conversion  by the average or by the top value presupposes there will be a  freeze and that no more fluctuations will follow. As we are not  planning to implement a freeze, how can I know if conversion  will be by the average or by the top value? Converting prices  by the top value and salaries by the average value is  unacceptable. The rules have not yet been established. We will  never adopt two different measuring units, one for prices and  another one for salaries. Either Economic Policy Secretary  Winston Fristch was misinterpreted or he inferred more than what  he actually wanted to say.    [Marquez] Utility rates are quite high, while salaries,  which  are based on the current salary policy, are rather low.    [Cardoso] A plan to fight inflation does not seek either the  redistribution or the contraction of income. Our entire effort  concentrates on preventing a socially unfair mechanism. The  important factor is to compare the URV's starting point with  what is happening now, which is a steady deterioration of  salaries. This has happened independently of the law, because  no law can protect salaries from inflation. We are studying  ways to update salaries, which will provide stronger protection.  I am not saying salaried people's living conditions will  improve right from the start. I am saying that from the very  beginning, losses will be smaller.    [Marquez] So it will not be like the Cruzado Plan, under  which salaries received a productivity adjustment at the moment  of the conversion, right?    [Cardoso] One of the problems of the Cruzado Plan was a  mistake at the start, when there was excessive demand without  sufficient supply. This happened because of an increase, in  real terms, of salaries, which ended up producing a loss. It is  wrong to imagine that through a law or a provisional measure the  government will set salaries according to the mid-URV and prices  according to the top URV value. That would be absurd.    [Marquez] Labor unions have announced that they will strike  if salaries are adjusted by average values and prices are  adjusted by top values.    [Cardoso] I repeat: There is no definite rule yet. They  should strike against businessmen who increase prices and not  against the government.    [Marquez] Labor Minister Barelli has been defending the idea  that when salaries are converted into URV the previous year's  productivity be taken into consideration. The productivity of  Sao Paulo industries, for example, was 18 percent. Will that  also be taken into account?    [Cardoso] This must be discussed by the labor unions. We  want the negotiation to be based on the collective bargaining  contracts. We do not plan to introduce this element in the URV.    [Marquez] So, there will be no rule for salary conversion?    [Cardoso] As far as I am concerned there is no need for a  salary conversion rule, especially this sort of rule.    [Marquez] One of Fritsch's concerns is that salary  conversion  has to be very carefully done to avoid creating financial  cushions [gorduras] in the costs of companies, which they then  incorporate into their prices -- forcing them up.    [Cardoso] Salaries are only one component of a product's  price. We realize that salaries are not being increased, but  prices are. This concern would apply if our economy were stable,  open, and had a well-defined cost structure. But we have an  inflationary economy which is very confused and allows companies  to increase prices without linking them to salary hikes. There  is no definition yet. I refused so firmly to discuss the URV  before the fiscal reform is approved that I am sure no one has  been able to adopt this or that formula. Fritsch referred to  theoretical considerations about relations that should exist  between salaries and prices. This, however, is not related to  the government's decision, let alone to a provisional measure  that can be drafted by the government.    [Marquez] So, there is no provisional measure to establish  the URV?    [Cardoso] There may be one later, but so far there is  nothing  definite.    [Marquez] Another one of Minister Barelli's proposals is  that  the government consider a long period, two years, to figure out  the price average to be used for the conversion. Is this  feasible?    [Cardoso] It is a possibility, but nothing has been decided  yet. There is no reason to discuss that before having defined  the fiscal reform. I do not confirm any of these conversion  studies.    [Marquez] State-owned companies have updated prices, but  Petrobras [Brazilian Petroleum Corporation] has been passing  financial costs onto its products -- such as raw material for  packing -- thus forcing the private sector to increase its  prices.    [Cardoso] I deem that very bad. I have already asked for  confirmation that Petrobras is really increasing its prices by  passing on its financial costs. So far, Petrobras has not given  me any information. One of the advantages of the URV is that it  makes speculative increases in cost and prices unnecessary. All  that has to be done is to add cost and the interest rate.    [Marquez] How will rents be converted?    [Cardoso] This is very complicated. In rents conversion we  will be discussing not only URV's but also demand, which is very  low. We are being asked to reduce the renewal term on contracts  under the excuse that otherwise rents could drop. Others say  this is unnecessary, because it does not alter the level of  rents. At the moment of figuring the URV, we will need a rule,  but as I have already said, the URV is not compulsory. So far,  nothing has been defined. A request has been made that the law  on rents be reviewed. We will not do it because we are going to  create the URV and the review may become unnecessary.    [Marquez] What is the government's greatest concern    over the implementation of the URV?    [Cardoso] We did not want to enforce the URV during a period  of high inflation. Right now there is a tendency to halt this  growing trend. There were estimates that the inflation rate  would surpass 40 percent, but the FIPE [Economic Research  Institute Foundation] has already stated that this figure stands  at 39 percent. According to information supplied by Labor  Minister Walter Barelli, the cost of the family basket in Sao  Paulo increased by 35 percent. Public rates are not being  readjusted on the basis of current inflation, neither are fuels  or electricity rates. This concerns us most because it is  important not to have growing inflation in February.    [Marquez] Do you believe the talks that Adviser Jose Milton  Dallari is holding with businessmen will help to curb inflation?    [Cardoso] He is not there to control prices. His job is  important because he identifies problems regarding prices, even  regarding public rates so that we may make decisions. It is  also important for businessmen to know we are watching. The  entire price monitoring system was destroyed during Collor  administration. We must restore it.    [Marquez] Why did Congress not approve provisional measures  that increased taxes on financial corporations and banks? Was  it against the economic program or against you?    [Cardoso] It was because it happened on a Friday.    [Marquez] But Senator Pedro Simon, the government leader in  the Senate, said that the economic program was rejected because  of your presidential candidacy...    [Cardoso] I have never said I am a candidate and I believe  it  would be very selfish to try to prevent an eventual candidacy by  voting against a national program proposed by someone who has  said he is not seeking to be a candidate.    [Marquez] But you went to the Northeast to distribute family  baskets...    [Cardoso] I did not go to distribute family baskets. I went  with Planning Minister Stepanenko and Regional Development  Minister Canhim in response to an invitation by the governor of  Pernambuco. We went with four PFL [Liberal Front Party]  governors and one PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party]  governor to show that the federal government is implementing the  largest food distribution program in the country. I did not go  there to distribute any family baskets. Representatives from  several political parties were there. This is the third time I  have visited the area and now they come up with this. It is  mere speculation, it is completely groundless. I do not even  believe what some people say that the provisional measures were  not approved out of fear for my candidacy. Had the deputies  attended the session, we would have won two to one. But they  were not there because they never attend sessions on Fridays. It  was a lack of articulation. They were not there but they should  have been; I consider it unforgivable that they were not there,  particularly those from my party. The PPR [Progressive Renewal  Party] -- which is most opposed to these provisional measures --  was almost compelled to oppose it because of its business ties,  particularly with important businessmen. The PPR has to show it  is strongly defending their interests.    [Marquez] Did you really tell National Health Council  leaders  that you were annoyed with Sao Paulo Mayor Paulo Maluf because  of the instructions he gave the PPR?    [Cardoso] Paulo Maluf phoned me that same day and told me  that he would intercede so that the voting would not be blocked.  I believed him. He said he achieved an understanding to  readjust bus rates by only 33 percent. Before it was 40 percent.    If they sought to upset a presidential candidacy, why lower  it from 40 percent to 33 percent? There is a more serious issue  behind all this.    [Marquez] So what is the problem?    [Cardoso] It is not just political. On one side is the PPR  which does not vote in favor of increasing taxes, on the other  side is Congress, which only votes on Wednesday. How can we  conduct a constitutional reform this way? But it is even more  serious. There was a huge scandal just because the government  had two provisional measures rejected. From the financial  viewpoint, $400 million is not a lot of money. The most serious  aspect is that I cannot see in anyone the required zeal to fight  inflation, as if inflation were not a very serious problem. I  do not see the required zeal in dealing with other matters  either. Perhaps this lack of coordination and unity is a result  of the Congressional Investigating Committee, CPI. But we have  had several victories. For the first time, Congress agreed to  modify the ITR [Rural Property Tax]. I now hope the Social  Emergency Fund will be approved.    [Marquez] Will the agreement reached on 28 January with the  Chamber of Deputies and Senate presidents, and with  congressional leaders lead to the approval of the constitutional  amendment to create that fund?    [Cardoso] An agreement had already been reached but it was  broken. Deputy Adilson Peres said he would vote against it,  that he would not obstruct it. He changed his mind. In  politics people change their minds but when an agreement is  reached it is better not to change. The conclusion of today's  meeting was not really an agreement but a demonstration of  support. The president is very worried because it is difficult  to run the government if Congress does not allow it. The danger  is a crisis of governability. I have been warning about this  for a long time. No candidacy or my position in the ministry  are at stake. It would be easier for me not to be a minister.  I am not a minister for political or personal reasons but  because the president asked me in the midst of problems.    [Marquez] What should be done?    [Cardoso] It is necessary to take some measures on time  otherwise we will have problems. What worries me is that things  may happen any time. Congress must realize that we are in the  final phase of the negotiations of the foreign debt which took  years to implement. The issue of voting in Congress can  compromise the possibility of resolving the problem of the  foreign debt and of freeing the government from the need to ask  for money from the bank all the time which increases interest  rates and inflation. But what is so disappointing is that no  alternatives are presented.    [Marquez] Do you feel betrayed?    [Cardoso] No. There is indifference, a part of the political  sector does not seem to be in touch with the country. When  there is a link, there is debate. I am a senator and I know how  Congress works. It is not always 100 percent. Sometimes there  is weakness. Unfortunately this has lasted too long -- since the  CPI activities. I don't know if the CPI was a problem or a  revelation. I believe next week congressmen will show up to  vote. They may talk badly about me now that I am talking badly  about Congress. But what do I care? Will the people think the  same? I believe not. When people have conviction they should  speak out. One should not be worried about applause and  popularity, but always remember what is necessary.</p>

			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1992 (20): Drawings at high speed - Architectural applications / CAD, User Views 'WE work for the car industry and when they want something, they want it right away,' says Mr Alexander Evans, partner in the Coventry-based architects Hellberg Harris Partnership, who realised four years ago that in order to produce and adapt their drawings very quickly, the 10-strong company needed CAD technology. 'We wanted something to help us produce drawings, adapt them, and prototype so that we could 'walk through' designs with clients.' Computervision, Intergraph and AutoCAD were on too grand a scale or not close enough to architectural needs for the partnership. They wanted something intuitive and GUI-based and found that the Architrion package, hosted on the friendly Macintosh computer, met a all their needs. 'We chose Architrion because it is designed for architects and by them,' comments Mr Evans. 'It works in the way we think.' Consultancy How and Marshall (now KRCS) supplied Architrion II version 5.5, running on a pair of Mac IIs, running 19-inch mono and colour monitors - about Pounds 4,000 each - plus another Pounds 4,000-worth of printers and plotters. The entire system was installed for Pounds 20,000 and has been kept up to date with software upgrades and such extras as the Codec estimating and pricing software. Another advantage of taking this comparitively cheap route was the integration inbuilt in the Mac host: information can be swapped between word processing and desktop publishing applications - 'we can also take measurements from a disc from surveyors, for example, through the DXF translator.' Mr Evans is clear about the advantages: 'It's made us more efficient. We've obtained and retained clients just by offering a quick service. The interesting thing is that the client has a choice: we can do the job faster at a cheaper rate, or charge the same for a more in-depth work. Without exception they choose the cheaper route.' Friar House, Coventry, (see picture on back page) was developed with 3D 'as built' drawings, allowing high speed communication between consultants and clients, before plans are finalised. PRODUCT PROFILE Architrion Product: The Apple Macintosh version of Architrion, now on release 5.5, has been available in the UK for six years. The latest version for PCs was launched in February 1992, for which IBM holds sole marketing rights. It can be used in conjunction with Codec Computer Operated Quantifying and Pricing Software Release 1. Codec-Estimate, release 1, was launched in October 1992 in conjunction with IBM. It generates from Architrion CAD software the elements of a building, presenting scheduling and pricing information in bill-of-quantity format. Suppliers: Architrion PC is available through IBM authorised dealers. Codec Facilities, developers of Codec-Estimate, is a UK company founded in March 1992. Number of users: 12,000 Macintosh users (350 in UK), 4,000 PC users worldwide (Architrion). Price: Pounds 1,995 plus VAT for Architrion PC/PS version; Pounds 2,255 plus VAT for Codec-Estimate.

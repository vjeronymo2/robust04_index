			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Footsie 3,200 mark challenged in nervous trade - Market report A highly-charged session saw the UK stock market struggle to hold on to the 3,200 mark on the FT-SE Index as it closed just ahead of the US Federal Reserve's decision to signal a modest rise in short-term interest rates. In mid-afternoon, the London stock market plunged sharply to a new trading low for the year of 3,186.9 in the face of a sell-off in stock index futures. The market was dominated throughout the day by the prospects for the meeting of the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee (FOMC). London closed a few minutes ahead of the Federal Reserve's actions in the US money markets, and UK analysts were left to ponder the implications overnight. The session opened strongly, with UK government bonds leading equities ahead and interest rate confidence heartened in Europe by the Bundesbank announcement of another variable rate money market repos tender today. UK company news also continued to help sentiment, as Prudential, the UK life and general insurance group, joined the list of leading British companies to increase its dividend payment; but the Prudential share price became a casualty of the market setback later in the day. Although trading volume was unimpressive at this stage, the Footsie climbed by more than 22 points and the market appeared confident in spite of the uncertainty ahead of the FOMC meeting. But the stock market was halted in its tracks and then driven sharply downwards when the June futures contract on the Footsie ran into trouble. Although selling of the contract, still in its early days, was not heavy, the price quickly fell through the 3,200 mark and took the underlying stock market with it. Traders suspected that futures selling came from securities houses suddenly nervous ahead of the FOMC meeting. The stock market fell into important support territory before rallying, once again taking its lead from the stock index futures sector. Concern was expressed at the evident power of derivatives markets to influence the underlying stock market. In part, this reflected the lack of volume and nervousness in equities while bond markets remain so fickle. The FT-SE Index struggled back into positive territory to close at 3,201.5, a net gain of 3.5 on the day. London traders were then left on the sidelines to watch the response of the US credit markets to the Federal Reserve's actions which, it was then clear, were likely to lead to an early tightening in credit policies in the US. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index followed the market trend, ending the day with a loss of 1.4 at 3,853.1. Seaq volume picked up in the second half of the session to record a total of 678m shares, a third higher than on Monday, when retail business in equities was worth Pounds 1.19bn. The retail number, the most significant guide to genuine investment activity in the stock market, was at the lower end of daily averages for the past twelve months. While some Far Eastern stocks rebounded strongly behind the 4 per cent upturn in the Hong Kong market, the rest of the UK market was unable to escape from the shadow cast ahead of the FOMC meeting. The erratic performance from bond markets over the past week has underlined the dependence of equities on the interest rate drama currently being acted out in Europe and the US.</p>

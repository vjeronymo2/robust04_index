			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Evgeniy Vyatkin, Candidate of Technical </F> Sciences: "Unemployment: Who Will Miss the Boat?"]    [Text] Some 80,000 unemployed were registered in  Ukraine at the end of 1993. According to data from the state  employment service, 337 enterprises are currently at the verge  of bankruptcy, and if they are shut down more than 70,000  additional workers will become unemployed. This data does not  take into account the so-called hidden unemployment, which is  evident at hundreds of enterprises around the country.    The problem has come to the fore. Without delay, we  must seek ways to alleviate it and help those who missed to boat  to adjust socially. Society must carry out natural selection to  ensure that the most able and qualified employees have jobs at  various sectors of the economy.    The Ukraine State Committee on the Coal Industry has  selected  the first batch of 21 mines for a weeding--i.e., a test of  economic viability. The collectives were given targets for  raising productivity and cutting costs in coal production this  year. If they fail to meet these targets, they will be shut down.    Thus, unemployment among mine workers is becoming reality  and  requires appropriate organizational preparation.    A technological lag in the Ukrainian coal industry has led  to  the existence of many unprofitable mines and caused excess  employment. Calculated on the basis of unit of energy per  employee, other countries have long ago stopped using labor so  uneconomically. The need for coal forces the state to support  loss-making enterprises and meet miners' demand for wage  increases. The pressure from miners on management sometimes  exceeds that of the administrative command system itself.  Miners' victories have several times pushed the country to the  brink of hopelessness, since the growth of salaries did not  produce appropriate increases in output. Large-scale subsidies  encouraged social parasitism and became reflected in a general  worsening of the economic situation.    Today, the country finds itself on the brink of a social  cataclysm. Ukraine President L.Kravchuk put the problem as  follows: we will either perish or find the means and the  strength to save Ukraine. One of the main means for salvation is  to solve the fuel and energy crisis. In this sector, coal has  become the main resource of the country, since local production  of gas covers only 22 percent of the country's needs and oil  just 8 percent. This is why the stabilization and development of  the coal industry has assumed vital importance. We need coal as  much as we need bread. But this bread can no longer be purchased  at the old price: otherwise, coal will become the destruction of  the country, not its hope. This will clearly require a sharp  change of the practices and outlook on employment that exist in  the industry.    The outline for the development of the industry to 2005  states that layoffs in the industry will primarily be effected  by closing down mines after their coal deposits become  exhausted. It is also possible that some layoffs will stem from  market processes, which may lead to the reduction of output and  even closure of some mines.    According to calculations, the layoff process will  accelerate  from 1996 and will continue to 2005. But, evidently, the current  catastrophic situation in the country's economy requires that  the process of weeding out unhealthy enterprises begin sooner.    Layoffs and retraining of employees for jobs in other  industries is a normal process which accompanies the development  of production. But in the coal industry it has been hampered by  miners' demands that jobs be preserved. One leader of the  Donbass strike committees called job reductions an attempt by  the government to "squeeze miners out of the pits." The State  Committee on the Coal Industry felt that it had plenty of  time--as pointed out earlier, job cuts in the industry were not  planned to start before 1996--and did not address the issue  closely. This was, apparently, also the reason why it turned  down the proposal from the Ministry of Labor to draft jointly an  employment program for the industry. Nor did it support the  proposal to establish a special center under its auspices to  coordinate the work and provide normative and methodological  guidance to enterprises, so that they could use their labor  resources more efficiently.    Especially important in solving today's employment problems  is to select able employees, analyze changing employment trends  within industries and identify retraining needs. Experience has  shown that a sociological analysis of employee qualifications  contributes to success. When supplemental paragraphs for the  agreement on pay rates and labor and social guarantees between  the State Committee on the Coal Industry and industry trade  unions were drafted, the Committee was required to commission a  study on this issue in the third quarter of 1993. But this  resolution was ignored and was merely a waste of time.    Now, due to the decision by the government to abolish  subsidies to loss-making enterprises, the picture is set to  change rapidly. Business requires that the management of the  State Committee on the Coal Industry and of industry trade  unions urgently provide organizational support and funds for  such studies, which will eventually produce a methodology for  compiling social and professional classifications of workers. It  will become a tool allowing enterprise managers and unions to  use a consistent approach for assessing the abilities of  different workers and for achieving social justice in the  employment sphere.</p>

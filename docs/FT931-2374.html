			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Plan for Rosyth is criticised ROSYTH Royal Dockyard, the privately-managed Fife naval facility threatened with losing its nuclear submarine refitting business, said yesterday that a proposal for it to upgrade oil tankers instead was unlikely to work. The proposal, made last month by the rival Devonport yard in Plymouth, was aimed at finding an alternative use for the incomplete submarine dock project at Rosyth, on which Pounds 120m of government money has been spent. Rosyth's counter-study found the proposal 'deeply flawed'.</p>

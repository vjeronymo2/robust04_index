			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: When too much weight is given to verbal element of human intelligence Sir, In the jobs column of September 15 ('Why established theory is now suspect'), Michael Dixon asked if readers might suggest explanations of the apparent paradox of an autistic person, almost incapable of communicating by speech, being enormously creative in music and the visual arts. May I suggest that the explanation lies in the role of speech and the ability of the brain to convert thoughts into words. We do not think entirely in words. We, like other animals, do a lot of thinking in non-verbal ways. We then develop our thoughts by using language, both as a logical structure for analysis, and as a means of recording steps in an analysis which would be too complex to memorise. In addition, of course, we use it as a means of exchanging ideas and data with others. Much of human brain power must be taken up in interpreting and using speech. Perhaps it is analogous to the latest developments in computer technology where a lot of additional computing power has had to be introduced to operate graphical interfaces. These have made it easier to communicate with the computers but have not necessarily made the computers inherently faster or more powerful. An autistic person who has some fault in the mental processes involved in the interpretation of speech may have excellent faculties in the non-verbal processes of the brain. We may have put too much weight on the verbal element in intelligence. My cat regularly goes out into the fields and comes back quite soon with a rabbit. He has made a study of animal behaviour and worked out a successful strategy for obtaining a regular supply of his preferred food. He cannot read, write or speak.

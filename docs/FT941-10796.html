			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / Development bank planned for inner-city area The search has started for a chief executive to run a development trust which is intended to become the UK's first community development bank. It is to operate in the deprived Birmingham inner-city area of Aston. He or she will be a 'a laterally thinking banker', according to Mr Pat Conaty, development director of Birmingham Settlement, the charity which has been studying the possibility of a community bank for five years and is behind the Aston project. Birmingham Settlement is seeking to raise from public and private-sector sources Pounds 3.5m in initial capital for what will be called Aston Reinvestment Trust. Mr Conaty said yesterday that operations would start in April 1995 and there would be an application three years later for a banking licence that would enable the organisation to accept deposits. The chairman of the trust will be Sir Adrian Cadbury, former chairman of Cadbury Schweppes, the food and drinks manufacturer, and a director of the Bank of England since 1970. His deputy will be Sir Richard Knowles, the recently retired Labour leader of Birmingham City Council. The attempt to establish a new local bank runs against general banking trends. The banking system has become increasingly centralised and based on the four largest clearers. Since the recession, lending has been more closely controlled from head offices as the discretion of local managers has been reduced. Mr Conaty said that Birmingham Settlement was holding talks with both National Westminster Bank and Co-operative Bank about leveraging the trust's capital, once it had been raised. Lloyds Bank had previously taken some interest in the project, he added. Aston Reinvestment Trust will seek to move into a void opened by the departure of the clearing banks from Aston. 'It will concentrate its investment in a specific area to try and get market forces working again,' Mr Conaty said. Aston's unemployment rate is 36.9 per cent, the second highest of Birmingham's wards. Male unemployment is running at 49.9 per cent and female at 17.8 per cent. According to its recently completed business plan, the trust will work through two investment companies running in parallel and with overlapping board membership. It is expected to handle 144 investments in the first five years. The first company, essentially commercial in its nature, is to be the Investment Fund which will lend to business and housing projects and be expected to make a profit. The second one, social in emphasis, will be the Development Fund which will finance packages that contribute to local regeneration, such as training schemes.</p>

			<p><P> October 30, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> CZECHOSLOVAKIAN QUARTET OPENS FOUNDERS HALL SERIES;  </P> <P> DESPITE A WEAK PROGRAM, THE GROUP MANAGES TO FILL THE PERFORMING ARTS CENTER  WITH AN ATMOSPHERE OF CULTURAL INTIMACY.  </P> <P> The Panocha String Quartet opened the 1990-91 "Music in Founders Hall" series  at the Orange County Performing Arts Center with a concert Sunday centered  around works by their Czech compatriots Bohuslav Martinu and Leos Janacek. As  representatives of native culture, the quartet itself was much more consistent  than its program.  </P> <P> Violinists Jiri Panocha and Pavel Zejfart, violist Miroslav Sehnoutka and  cellist Jaroslav Kulhan brought a warm, dark tone and an intimate atmosphere to  the stark 299-seat Founders Hall. Opening with a refined reading of Beethoven's  "Harp" Quartet, the four demonstrated secure communicative powers whether  required to apply delicate precision or pushed into aggressive contrapuntal  competition.  </P> <P> The Czech compositions underscored the quartet's stylistic versatility, its  ability to shift easily from classical to contemporary idioms. Martinu's  Quartet No. 5, written in 1938, is a modern adaptation of Eastern European  flavors. It begins with a busy hubbub of a movement punctuated by interludes of  intense lyricism. Eerie melodies surface throughout the piece, dominating the  atmospheric adagio and emerging with ominous insistence in the third-movement  allegro vivo. The musicians responded convincingly with a focused sound,  balancing troubled, interweaving lines with homophonic climaxes and worried  respites.  </P> <P> Dating from 1928 and subtitled "Intimate Letters," Janacek's Second Quartet is  a disjunct, undeveloped work that challenges performers to tie up myriad loose  ends. It is full of about-faces in tempo and sentiment, and it abounds in ideas  that -- though heard frequently enough to be memorable -- never blossom into  the next thought with any sense of inevitability. Any listeners who don't know  the story behind the piece -- a series of ardent love letters to a considerably  younger woman -- may find that it disintegrates into a hodgepodge of mixed  emotions.  </P> <P> The Panocha Quartet put up a mighty struggle. The players exploited what  strengths they could find -- the passionate passages of the first movement, the  inscrutable intensity of the third. Ultimately, however, the weaknesses of the  score defeated even these most valiant of suitors.  </P> <P> Two encores brought relief from the very serious and searching program -- a  graceful minuet from Mozart's E-flat Quartet, K. 171, and a lighthearted  arrangement entitled "Pizzicato" from Gluck's ballet "Don Juan." Understated  good nature marked both selections.  </P></p>

			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Nissan wins US court ruling Nissan has won its court battle in the US to prove its multipurpose vehicles are cars rather than trucks and so should carry an import tariff of 2.5 per cent instead of 25 per cent. The ruling by the US Court of Appeal paves the way for a possible refund of tariffs already paid by Nissan and supports the case of foreign car makers, many of them Japanese, which have been hit by the higher tariff rate on multipurpose vehicles imported into the US. Nissan, which imported a two-door multipurpose vehicle, the Pathfinder, into the US between 1989 and 1990, was ordered by US Customs in 1989 to pay a 25 per cent tariff on the vehicle, which was classified as a truck. The Japanese company had been appealing against the classification, saying the Pathfinder should be rated as a passenger car and given the lower tariff rate. The Pathfinder is manufactured at Nissan's plant in Kyushu, southern Japan. However, Nissan had stopped exporting the two-door Pathfinder in 1990 and started exporting a four-door version, after a US ruling classified four-door multipurpose vehicles as passenger cars. US vehicle makers have been able to use the 25 per cent tariff on imported trucks to secure a growing market for themselves. One reason for the fall in the Japanese share of the US market in the early 1990s was a lack of multipurpose vehicle models, but the truck tariff rate on imported multipurpose vehicles has not helped their market penetration. The argument put forward by the Big Three - Ford, Chrysler and General Motors - that imported multipurpose vehicles should be classified as trucks has not always been upheld by the authorities. In 1989, the US Treasury ruled that only two-door multipurpose vehicles should be classified as trucks, since their principal purpose could be considered transport of goods. Four-door multipurpose vehicles, on the other hand, should be classified as passenger cars since their principal purpose was to transport people, the Treasury decided. Furthermore, with the market dominated by US makers, the International Trade Commission could not sustain a finding of injury done against domestic vehicle makers when US manufacturers tried in 1992 to raise the tariff rate through dumping action.</p>

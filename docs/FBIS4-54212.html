			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 26 (YONHAP) -- Trade, Industry and Energy  Minister Kim Chol-su and his Japanese counterpart Eijiro Hata  held the third Korea-Japan trade ministers' meeting in Tokyo on  Thursday, with both agreeing to expand cooperation in such  high-tech information fields as multi-media.    They also decided to open a working-level meeting headed by  division director-level officials from Korea's Trade, Industry  and Energy Ministry and Japan's International Trade and Industry  Ministry.    Through the meeting, the two governments aim to spur  standardization, joint research, technology cooperation and  personnel education in the multi-media sector.    The move indicates that technology cooperation between Seoul  and Tokyo has shifted from traditional to more sophisticated  industries.    Moreover, the two ministers agreed that the Seoul Government  will choose model small- and medium-sized firms in such areas as  home electronic appliances, general machinery and automobile  parts manufacturing, and then the Japanese Government will send  experts to these Korean companies to provide support.    Korea will dispatch 200 additional trainees from small- and  medium-sized companies to Japan in 1995-98 and Tokyo will send  20 experts this year and 30 experts from 1995 annually to Seoul.    The Japanese Government also plans to send an economic  delegation to Seoul in late October to study investment  conditions.    Meanwhile, a 100-member Korean delegation headed by the  chairman of the Korea-Japan Economic Association, Pak Yong-hak,  is visiting Tokyo, Osaka and Kita Kyushu from May 25-31 to  attract Japanese investment.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Washington agreement between the Croats and the  Muslims in many ways resembles the Yalta [agreement]. It  harbingers the division of the former Yugoslavia into western  and eastern spheres of influence, but also opens another  possibility, Vuk Draskovic said at the news conference of the  Serbian Renewal Movement. Radovan Pantovic has the details.    [Begin recording] [Pantovic] Neither the West or Russia are  in favor of a Yalta-like division. It is for Belgrade to decide  whether it shall be Yalta or an establishment of a certain  union, that is, a reintegration on the territory of the former  Yugoslavia, Vuk Draskovic says. If the first option is decided  on, the Serbs in Bosnia will get international recognition, but  will have to concede one-third of territories and will probably  not be able to join Yugoslavia except in a confederal form. As  an alternative to this arrangement, interpreting the Washington  agreement Draskovic mentioned the possibility for the Serbs to  join a federal or a similar union [savez] with the Muslims and  the Croats. This would enable Serbian cantons to join a  confederation with Serbia and Montenegro. If they join a  federal arrangement with Croats and Muslims, considerably  smaller territorial concessions would be demanded of the Serbs.  The Serbian cantons would be equal users of all international  funds for renewal and development of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Serbia  could also reckon with the economic aid that had been promised  to Croatia for signing the peace, something that would mean the  lifting of sanctions. In conformity with this, the Serbian  Krajina would establish three-fold connections, and would do so  as a state: with Croatia, the Serbian cantons in Bosnia, and  Yugoslavia.    According to Draskovic's interpretation of the Washington  document, Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia  -- FYROM] would also join a confederation with Yugoslavia in  this case. Therefore....    [Draskovic] The Serbian Renewal Movement is against Yalta.  From the very beginning, as regards Bosnia-Herzegovina, the  Serbian Renewal Movement is in favor of a cantonal setup. The  Serbian Renewal Movement favors this second solution.    [Pantovic] The Serbian Renewal Movement demands a firm  international guarantee that the return of refugees to their  homes would be secured. Draskovic condemned, as he put it,  Belgrade's silence, because in his opinion, the fate of Serbs  and the Serbian people must not be decided upon by the Pale top  military political leadership alone.

			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / People: English Trust makes Gadd moves Following the purchase of the UK corporate finance activities of boutique merchant bank JS Gadd last month, English Trust has put former Gadd managing director Charles Good on to the board of the group's holding company and Stephen Goschalk on to the board of the principal operating subsidiary English Trust Company Ltd. JS Gadd's parent, SG Investments, which was founded by Staffan Gadd in 1987, three years after he quit his position as chairman and chief executive of Samuel Montagu, has been engaged in a series of disposals because of pressure from its original Swedish shareholders, many of which have gone into receivership, to realise the cash. Goschalk, 40, trained as a chartered accountant with Touche Ross; after spells at London Trust and Chartfield, the venture capital group, he joined JS Gadd on the corporate finance side. Good, meanwhile, goes on to the group board in a non-executive capacity (see below). At the same time, English Trust, which effected a management buy-out from Nordbanken in 1991, promoted Alexandra Gillham, 29, on to the board of English Trust Company. She has been closely involved in advising Trio Investment Trust in the prolonged deal last year involving the purchase of money broker Martin Bierbaum. Notwithstanding the depressed state of the UK corporate finance market and the number of second-tier merchant banks who have curtailed their involvement in it, Goschalk, who claims to have a number of deals in the pipeline, says he genuinely believes a modest outfit like English Trust can offer small and medium-sized companies a better service - in contrast to the 'very mixed' treatment they get from the leading houses.</p>

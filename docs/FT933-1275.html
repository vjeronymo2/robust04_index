			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / International Company News: Lyonnaise des Eaux Dumez halves net profit LYONNAISE des Eaux Dumez, the French industrial and utility group, announced a halving of net profits in the first six months of the year from FFr711m to FFr342m (Dollars 60m). The company said the downturn reflected the weakness of the European construction and property sectors but forecast that full-year net profits would be higher than the FFr379m achieved in 1992. The first-half result was achieved on sales of FFr45.1bn, about the same level as in the corresponding period last year. Exceptional gains fell from FFr629m to FFr300m between the two periods. The group's property division continued to suffer, reporting a net loss of FFr330m compared with a loss of FFr273m in the first half of 1992. Construction losses increased more sharply, rising from FFr4m in the first six months of last year to FFr139m this year. The holding and services division raised net profits from FFr566m to FFr768m.</p>

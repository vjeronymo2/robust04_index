			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / ASH chief may scoop Pounds 1.67m pay-off Mr Tom Buffett could receive compensation totalling Pounds 1.67m after his surprise decision to step down as chairman and chief executive of Automated Security (Holdings). Mr Buffett built ASH into a large electronic security systems group through a series of acquisitions in the 1980s. Pre-tax profits peaked at Pounds 45.1m on turnover of Pounds 173.2m in 1992 but the group's financial performance has been erratic and the shares have underperformed the FT-SE All Share index by almost 80 per cent over the past five years. The shares closed 5p lower at 83p yesterday. In a statement to the Stock Exchange, ASH said Mr Buffett 'has agreed with the board it is now appropriate that he should step down'. The company added that Mr Buffett, 'now resides abroad and wishes to develop other opportunities'. Lord Lane of Horsell, who moves from deputy chairman to succeed Mr Buffett as chairman, declined to elaborate on the reasons for Mr Buffett's departure, saying: 'I would not want to go beyond the statement.' It is understood, however, that Mr Buffett has been spending an increasing amount of time abroad, and that the board felt it was becoming increasingly difficult for him to carry out fully his management activities. Yesterday Lord Lane confirmed that Mr Buffett, whose remuneration totalled Pounds 334,000 in the year to November 30, was on a five-year rolling contract. He added that the issue of compensation was the subject of negotiation and, 'is being sorted out by the lawyers'. Mr Buffett was quoted as saying: 'It is with deep regret that I am leaving ASH, but I believe that in the circumstances it was right for me to go.' Following his departure, the company will be run by a management committee chaired by Lord Lane. The committee will initially concentrate on 'refining the strategic options now open to ASH', and will shortly begin the search for a new chief executive. ASH also announced pre-tax profits for the three months to August 3 of Pounds 2.59m, up from Pounds 903,000 a year earlier. Turnover from continuing operations increased by 10.1 per cent to Pounds 40.4m producing earnings per share of 1.3p compared with a previous loss of 0.3p. Lex, Page 24</p>

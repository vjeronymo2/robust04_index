			<p><P> November 6, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GIANTS STAY PERFECT BY BEATING COLTS, 24-7  </P> <P> The New York Giants continue to play their own personal game of "chicken" with  the San Francisco 49ers.  </P> <P> The Giants beat the Indianapolis Colts, 24-7, Monday night to join the 49ers at  8-0, the first time in 56 years two NFL teams have been unbeaten this deep into  the season.  </P> <P> New York won with a smothering defense, two touchdown runs by Ottis Anderson, a  lot of jitterbugging by Dave Meggett and precise passing by Phil Simms, who  completed 17 of 21 passes for 172 yards. Then the Giants clinched it with a  31-yard fumble return by Dave Duerson.  </P> <P> It was the Giants' 11th consecutive regular-season victory going back to last  year. It brought them one step closer to a Monday night game at San Francisco  Dec. 3 against the 49ers, winners of 16 in a row.  </P> <P> The last time two teams were 8-0 was in 1934, when Chicago and Detroit  eventually went to 10-0. New York and San Francisco would both be 11-0 if they  get through their next three games.  </P> <P> This one was no contest in the first half. The Giants scored on their first  three possessions -- a 23-yard field goal by Matt Bahr and touchdown runs of  two and three yards by Anderson -- and had a 17-0 halftime lead after holding  the Colts to one first down.  </P> <P> The Colts came back to take the second half kickoff and march 80 yards for a  touchdown on a one-yard run by Albert Bentley. It was set up by a 17-yard  fourth-down pass to Billy Brooks from Jeff George, who was 23 for 37 for 160  yards and was sacked three times, twice by Leonard Marshall.  </P></p>

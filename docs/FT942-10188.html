			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / Interest rates cut as French sense recovery The Bank of France yesterday took a further step in easing monetary conditions, trimming its key short-term interest rate, amid signs that economic recovery is gaining momentum and that inflationary pressures remain weak. The decision to lower the intervention rate, the floor for money market rates, from 5.6 per cent to 5.5 per cent, is the third small cut in three weeks and reflects the central bank's strategy of easing borrowing costs in line with the reduction in Germany's repo rate. The move coincided with the release of encouraging industrial production data. According to Insee, the national statistics office, industrial production rose by 0.6 per cent in February, compared with January. The increase in industrial production was supported by strong manufacturing output, which has risen in each of the past four months, partly reflecting the impact of a sharp increase in car sales. Economists said they saw little evidence that reviving economic activity was re-kindling inflation, although data released yesterday showed a slight rise in annualised inflation in April to 1.7 per cent. 'Inflation is very low, and I think it will remain at about the 1.5 per cent level for this year,' said one economist at a French merchant bank. The trends will be welcomed by the prime minister, Mr Eduard Balladur, whose decline in opinion polls has begun to reverse in the past few weeks. Officials at the economy ministry said that the statistics confirmed their predictions of progressive recovery this year after the 1 per cent contraction of gross domestic product in 1993. 'We are seeing a gradual, but steady improvement,' said one official, who said that the government's forecast of 1.4 per cent GDP growth this year was likely to be surpassed. France's improved economic recovery has, however, made little impact on unemployment, which currently stands at 12.2 per cent of the workforce. A spokesman for the economy ministry said that the unemployment statistics of the past few months had shown a stabilisation in the jobless rate. But he added that a further increase was possible during the summer as school leavers arrive on the labour market. Private sector economists in Paris endorsed this view, stressing the gradual nature of France's economic recovery and the caution expressed by industry. Companies such as Rhone Poulenc, the pharmaceuticals and chemicals group, say they see signs of recovery but that a strong improvement in demand is not expected until the end of this year.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Military Procurator General V.M. Kruk </F> by correspondent Igor Serebryakov; place and date not given;  from the "Aty-Baty" program]    [Text] [Serebryakov] As a person who deals directly with  the subject, could you tell us whether corruption in the armed  forces is increasing or decreasing?    [Kruk] It is difficult to talk about the decrease of crime  in  the military or in society. It continues to grow -- perhaps not  at the rate that it did in previous years, but it is increasing.  And because the armed forces are part of society, as they used  to say, the troubles and hardships taking place in society are  transmitted to the armed forces. It is true that the general  situation is a negative one, and it continues to worsen in  society at large, and this also has a negative effect on the  armed forces. Crime is on the increase, and the military  procurator's office currently is handling several ongoing  investigations against several high-ranking officials on charges  of corruption, bribery, unauthorized commercial ties,  self-enrichment, and so forth. These cases are about to be  publicized. It will be possible to reveal them in the near  future, but it is still detrimental to talk about them because  of tactical considerations. There are such cases, and we will  concentrate on them. We investigated several times more cases  like this type last year than during all preceding years.  Military procuracy organs are more independent today from any  kind of pressure from ministerial departments than ever before.  We obey only the prosecutor general and the law, and I do not  know of any case in the past few years win which pressure  produced any discernible result.    [Serebryakov] So what is going on, then? I have recently had  an opportunity to tour the hot spots: Stepanakert, Georgia,  Abkhazia, and so on. I am a military man myself, and I can  clearly distinguish regulation-issue Soviet Army weaponry from  that which is not. In all of these wars, hundreds and thousands  of people are being killed by weapons which were supplied to  both gangs and irregular forces of these republics through  informal channels from the depots of the [former] Soviet army.  I think that if someone were not selling these weapons  illegally, these terrible conflicts on the perimeter of our  country would not exist. Young power structures in the process  of being formed do not have enough money to buy such weapons, so  how did they get there, how did this happen, and who is  responsible?    [Kruk] The myths and legends claiming that all the gangs and  bands, all the warring sides are armed exclusively with military  equipment and weapons from the Russian armed forces are  unsubstantiated. The thing is, after the USSR collapsed,  enormous quantities of equipment and arms remained on the  territories of the former republics. Let us remember the  weapons depots in Agdam.    [Serebryakov] But they belonged to the Soviet army.    [Kruk] They later came under the jurisdiction of Azerbaijan,  which privatized them. All of this [equipment] is being used  for fighting now and will continue to be used for this purpose  for a long time to come.    Let us cite the situation in Georgia. After the well-known  events of 1991 which had to do with Georgia becoming a sovereign  state, gangs of every kind had one goal only: to steal anything  that was not nailed down. This meant weapons first and  foremost, but also equipment, drugs, and other valuables. Let  us remember that over 600 armed attacks against Russian units  deployed in Georgia took place during 1992-93. The only goal  [of these attacks] was capturing arms and equipment.    [Serebryakov] The stock at the Agdam depots could not have  lasted for more than three months of fighting. So they used it  all up in the first three months of the war. But where do they  take it from after that? There is only one possibility: One  either pumps it in from Iran or from Afghanistan. But I think  that it is coming from the north.    [Kruk] The Agdam depots are not the only ones of their kind.  Moreover, we must not forget that arms arrive at the hot spots  not only from Russia but also from neighboring countries, such  as Armenia, the Dniestr region, Ukraine, and several others.    Let us remember the case, which was scandalous at the time,  of the dachas in Krasnogorsk and Domodedovo. The top echelon of  the Defense Ministry was accused of accomplishing the illegal  privatization of dachas. There was a lot of talk and noise  concerning this, and demands for blood from every side. Time  passed, the dust settled, all the material is in the courts,  suits have been brought, but the cases still have not been  settled. But this is not our fault.    [Serebryakov] But why? What is the matter? Did the courts  fail to adopt a decision, or maybe there are not enough facts?    [Kruk] There might be enough facts, but the legal basis is  not always appropriate for the situations we encounter today.  After all, the situation changes, and what might have been  illegal two or three years ago has acquired a legal status  today. Everyone still experiences a housing shortage. We are  building housing with the help of Germany, Finland, and the  Baltic republics. It is a different matter that the housing  does not always go to those for whom it is intended. Yes, there  are instances of abuses.    [Text] [Serebryakov] Are these serious?    [Kruk] As long as there are shortages, there will be abuses.  There is no avoiding it. This is one of life's axioms. If  there is something that has to be divided between people, and if  there are more people than there are pieces of cake, someone  always will get preferential treatment.    [Serebryakov] Is the procurator's office today pursuing  cases  involving housing matters?    [Kruk] There are quite a few.    [Serebryakov] Will some conclusions be drawn?    [Kruk] Undoubtedly. Extensive reports are being prepared for  the defense minister and the government. These questions are  raised continuously. Not a quarter goes by.... [Kruk pauses]  We present this issue to different levels several times a year.  Yes, we take measures to solve certain problems, but new ones  crop up.    [Serebryakov] If there is some barrier preventing all these  corrupt structures from developing, then it must be the military  procurator's office first and foremost. How do you publicize  your work to the people?    [Kruk] An investigator or a team of investigators carry out  work regarding a certain person in some region and in a concrete  garrison or department. Only those who are connected to this  case know about it. Several months usually go by before a case  is completed. The unit that this person was serving in is  usually informed, the command is notified, and the appropriate  information -- to the effect that an investigation of the case  established this and that and that the circumstances which made  it possible were such and such -- is distributed up to and  including the defense minister. A set of measures is proposed to  prevent such incidents in the future. It is a different matter  that all of this is not always widely publicized. The regional  or national public does not know that a certain case has been  investigated and that those found guilty were justly punished.  I think that this is partially our fault, too, in that we do  not address the mass media a lot. It might be because the  alliance between the mass media and the investigative organs has  not been very productive. Both sides are to blame for this, and  correspondents printing such material do not always interpret it  correctly. Sometimes there is just talk, slander, and incorrect  interpretations, which distort the whole meaning. There is a  lot of repercussions and noise....    [Serebryakov, interrupting] Well, they are looking for a  sensation, but actually, they just obstruct the case.    [Kruk] Or they are trying to dramatize things just for the  effect of it. In real life, it is much more prosaic, but they  wish for something big and heroic. In practice, everything is  much simpler.</p>

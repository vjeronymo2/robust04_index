			<p><P> September 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOTEBOOK: ALL THE BICE NEWS THAT'S FIT TO PRINT: CLARK COMES WEST  </P> <P> When Roberto Ruggiero, president of Da Bice U.S.A., announced recently that he  had hired noted New York-based chef Patrick Clark (most recently of the  just-closed Metro) and former Tavern on the Green general manager Bruce Axler  to launch a series of casual new eateries dubbed Cafe Med, he simultaneously  informed us that he had a "surprise" planned for the Beverly Hills Bice this  fall. Paul Guzzardo, director of operations for the company, has now revealed  just what that surprise is -- and part of it is that Clark won't have anything  to do with the Cafe Med chain after all.  </P> <P> More to the point, Clark will be coming to Bice in Beverly Hills as chef,  starting in early October. The restaurant's original chef, Pino Pasqualato  (formerly of our own Valentino and La Bruschetta), will continue in the  kitchen, working side by side with Clark. "Patrick's forte is really fish and  meat," says Guzzardo, "so he'll concentrate on those areas, while Pino  concentrates on pastas and other specifically Italian items. We also hope  they'll engage in a little bit of competition that will spark new ideas for the  menu."  </P> <P> That menu, Guzzardo continues, will evolve under Clark's direction. "We'll keep  the same basic dishes, but add a little American-Continental accent to our  cuisine," he says. "Roberto (Ruggiero) has taken the advice of many who have  said, 'Basta with the pasta!' I don't mean that we'll be deviating from our  main line, but it will be fuller than it's been."  </P> <P> He adds that Clark is expected to stay at the Beverly Hills Bice for at least a  year. Later, he might transfer to another location, in keeping with a  longstanding Bice practice of exchanging chefs between restaurants. As for the  Cafe Meds, says Guzzardo, "Patrick will consult on them, but basically our  feeling is that he's so good, we want to use him at Bice, rather than asking  him to downplay his creativity for a more informal place."  </P> <P> In other Bice news, Guzzardo has announced that the old Bice Pomodoro site on  La Cienega, shuttered for some months, has just reopened under new management  -- but with Da Bice U.S.A. continuing as owners of the property. The new  management group is headed by Alain Hasson, who was maitre d' at Mr. Chow in  Beverly Hills, and the restaurant has been rechristened Le Bilboquet -- no  relation to the trendy little bistro of the same name in New York. "The cuisine  is mainly Mediterranean, from Nice," says Guzzardo. "We're just letting Alain  go with his concept and ideas."  </P> <P> THE BIG STINK: The annual L.A. Garlic Festival, usually held each July on a  closed-off portion of San Vicente Boulevard in West Hollywood, did not perfume  the air this year. The event, which was organized by Bruce and Katherine  Veneiro of Nucleus Nuance and benefited the local American Red Cross  (garlic/vampires/blood -- get it?), was reportedly squelched this year by West  Hollywood officials on the grounds that it was frivolous, and might help give  the community a reputation as a "party town."  </P> <P> Garlic-lovers should not despair, though, because at least one longtime regular  participant in the event, Ken Frank of La Toque on the Sunset Strip, plans a  mini-garlic festival of his own at his restaurant, from the 10th to the 15th of  this month. "Somehow," Frank says, "when people go out for a garlic menu,  they're always in a good frame of mind." The observance -- which Frank has  dubbed "La Cure d'Ail" (The Garlic Cure) -- will include a different  four-course menu every night, priced at $36 a head (of people, not of garlic).  </P> <P> "There'll be regular garlic and elephant garlic, raw garlic and cooked garlic,"  says Frank. "We'll make pastas and salads and soups -- a good Provencal fish  soup with truly garlicky rouille, for instance -- and offer diners a choice of  meat or fish as a main course every night." Desserts, Frank adds, will not be  garlic flavored. "We've been there, we've seen, we've learned, and we will not  be returning," he says of such confections.  </P> <P> For the time being, incidentally, Frank has dropped his plans, announced two  years ago, to convert La Toque into a larger, more informal California-style  restaurant. "I think at this point," he says, "I'm just going to be satisfied  -- to keep doing a good job, keep doing what we've been doing for the last 11  years."  </P> <P> NEW FERRY SCHEDULE: Gerard and Virginie Ferry, owners of L'Orangerie on La  Cienega and Pastel in the Rodeo Collection in Beverly Hills, plan to close the  latter restaurant at the end of this month. "It's the end of our lease," says  Gerard, "and I think I'd rather concentrate on L'Orangerie instead. We've  always done very well at lunch here, but the whole Rodeo Collection is dead at  night -- we're the only ones here -- and we do very badly at dinner time. A  restaurant can't survive on lunch alone, especially today." At the same time,  the Ferrys have hired a new chef at L'Orangerie -- 31-year-old Jean-Claude  Parachini, a veteran of the kitchens at two prominent Paris restaurants,  Vivarois and L'Ambroisie, and himself recently the head chef at La Grenouille  in New York. The former chef at L'Orangerie, Jean-Francois Meiteignier, is  investigating the possibility of opening a restaurant of his own, says Gerard.  </P> <P> OUT AND ABOUT: Lawry's California Center in Los Angeles celebrates Mexican  Independence Day -- the real Mexican Independence Day, not Cinco de Mayo --  with a four-day program of special events and buffet meals, from the 13th  through the 16th (the last date is Independence Day). The vast majority of the  planned activities are free. Information: (213) 224-6842. . . . Annie and David  Gingrass, former chefs at Spago and now chefs at Wolfgang Puck's Postrio in San  Francisco, come to Los Angeles this Friday to teach a cooking class at the  Epicurean Cooking School in West Hollywood, beginning at 10:30 a.m. The cost is  $60 per person. The school also starts its new Professional Chef Training  Series, taught by graduates of the Culinary Institute of America, this month.  Tuition is $1,150, all-inclusive. Information: (213) 659-5990. . . . More than  20 Brentwood area restaurants -- including Berty's, the Brentwood Bar &amp;  Grill, Camelion's, the Daily Grill, Spangles, Sushi Boy, and Toscana -- will  offer tasting samples at Great Tastes of Brentwood next Sunday, Sept. 16, on  San Vicente Boulevard between Bringham and Darlington avenues in Brentwood. (In  offering to close a portion of its stretch of San Vicente Boulevard for this  event, Brentwood apparently doesn't mind if it gets a reputation as a party  town.) Tickets are $25 in advance -- call (213) 820-6888 to order them -- or  $30 at the event itself. Proceeds benefit the California Special Olympics, the  Brentwood Library, and SOS Coral Trees. . . . And Monday evenings in September  are "Wash Night" at Patout's in West Los Angeles, featuring all-you-can-eat  servings of red beans and rice with smoked sausage -- said to be traditional  Cajun wash-day fare -- for $12 per person.  </P></p>

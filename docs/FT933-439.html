			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / The Labour Party Conference: Scargill attacks party's MPs over coal report THE party's bitter divisions over coal privatisation exploded yesterday in an open row between Mr Arthur Scargill, president of the National Union of Mineworkers, and Mr Richard Caborn, chairman of the Commons trade and industry committee. At the end of a bad-tempered debate, delegates defied the leadership by overwhelmingly approving an NUM motion condemning pit closures and demanding renationalisation of the coal industry. The motion also confirmed conference support for Clause Four of the party constitution - public ownership of the means of production, distribution and exchange - reflecting continued grass roots support for policies regarded by the party leadership as outmoded. The row started with an attack by Mr Scargill on a Commons committee report on the coal industry which followed the government's proposals last year for widespread pit closures. Mr Scargill said the four Labour MPs on the 11-member committee had recommended longer working hours for miners to improve the competitive position of British coal. 'I don't want Labour MPs sitting on the green benches of Westminster fighting for a four-day week for themselves and recommending a seven-day week for miners,' he told cheering delegates. Mr Scargill said Labour's strategy of trying to win support for miners from Conservative MPs was like 'crying out for snowflakes in the middle of July'. He won a standing ovation from delegates, but was rebuked by Mr David Blunkett, the shadow health secretary, who chaired the debate. Mr Blunkett said it was 'very unfortunate when we turn our guns on ourselves'. Mr Caborn, the MP for Sheffield Central, denied that Labour MPs were 'the characters to sell out the mining industry', and claimed that Labour's strategy had prompted the biggest Conservative rebellion since the last election. He accused Mr Scargill of failing to capitalise on the conclusions of the committee's report, and urged the miners' leader to join a united front against the government. 'There is still a chance,' he said. 'Let's unite the movement. Let's bring on the bishops, bring on the churches, all those who want to have a say on energy policy. I hand that to you Arthur. Please come on board.' Ms Diana Jeuda, representing the national executive committee, asked delegates to reject the NUM motion and concentrate on 'the real fight' against privatisation. She said the NEC would propose restoring public control of coal at next year's conference 'if the government refuses to listen to public opinion'.</p>

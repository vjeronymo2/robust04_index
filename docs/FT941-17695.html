			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Pounds 1m income boost for Warburg director A vice-chairman of SG Warburg Group, the UK-based investment bank, added almost Pounds 1m to his income for 1993 after the exercise of options and the sale of bonus shares which together released Pounds 961,640. Mr Michael Gore was assigned to Tokyo as head of the Asia Pacific region earlier this year. The appointment surprised the City because Mr Gore had been the group's finance director since 1986. Mr Gore joined Warburg in 1964 and is one of the group's three vice-chairmen. The company told the stock exchange yesterday that Mr Gore executed his rights under the SG Warburg Group Executive Share Option Scheme over 33,559 shares of 25p each on December 29. The rights were granted in April 1987 at a price of 344.8p. Also on Wednesday, Mr Gore alerted trustees of the SG Warburg Group Employee Trust of his wish to acquire 67,987 shares in the group. Under the terms of the SG Warburg Group bonus scheme, shares may be acquired by executives as part of a performance-related pay package. The shares were acquired at the closing mid-price of 943.5p per share on Wednesday. The total of 101,546 shares were sold at 947p on December 30.</p>

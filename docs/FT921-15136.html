			<p>920111 FT  11 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Pena perks prompt parting MR DAN PENA, president and chief executive of Great Western Resources, has quit the beleaguered oil, coal and gas group. Payments totalling Dollars 1.45m made to him by the company, which it classifies as loans, will be deducted from his compensation package. Mr Pena's departure follows significant shareholder dissatisfaction with his performance and that of the company, the shares of which have fallen from 242p more than a year ago to last night's 8p, down 1p. Shareholders were also dissatisfied with expenses claimed by Mr Pena, which once included Dollars 10,000 to transport his dog Driller to Houston by private Lear jet. Mr Pena has since repaid the expense. Mr Pena's departure removes the immediate pressure for a Class Four circular which would have sought retroactive shareholder approval to reclass payments made to him during the 1991 fiscal year as loans. The decision on Mr Pena's departure was taken at a board meeting on Thursday morning, UK time. Mr Howard Wolf, who was brought in by shareholders to replace Mr Pena as chairman last month, said any compensation would 'not be material' after deducting the loans and other expenses. Had the circular come out, it would have shown that GWR made loans of Dollars 700,000, Dollars 600,000 and Dollars 150,000 to Mr Pena. However, he received a total of Dollars 2.65m during 1991, including his Dollars 600,000 annual salary. Most of the payments arose from the expenses of moving Mr Pena from Los Angeles to Houston, where the company is based, in 1990. Some Dollars 600,000, which will not be deducted from his pay-off, comprised Dollars 150,000 moving expenses and Dollars 450,000 interest on bridging loans for Mr Pena's new Dollars 4m house in Houston. Great Western also purchased a Dollars 1.1m penthouse flat in Houston to house Mr Pena and his family, rent and expense free, while work was done on the Houston house. From yesterday the company is charging the Penas rent, to be deducted from the pay-off. Of the loans, Dollars 600,000 was used to meet part of the repayment terms of Mr Pena's Houston home. The company took up the obligation, and attributed it to the potential loss on the value of his California home, which was never sold. A further Dollars 700,000 was for moving expenses and tax payments claimed on these charges by Mr Pena. The final Dollars 150,000 arose from refurbishment costs for the Houston house - including antiques and fittings  -which were invoiced to the company. Mr Pena also holds life insurance policies, paid for by GWR, with an annual premium of Dollars 144,000 and cover of about Pounds 10m. GWR now intends to stop the policies and retrieve any residual cash value. Mr Pena, who holds a little more than 10 per cent of GWR, remains on the board. However, Mr Wolf said he did not expect Mr Pena to be presented for re-election at the annual meeting next month. Mr Wolf also said yesterday that GWR planned to present details of the legal battle with its largest customer, South Carolina Public Service Authority, in the annual accounts. The group has had severe financial difficulties since SCPSA filed a suit against it in November 1990.</p>

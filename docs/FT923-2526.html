			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets: ERM worries evident in August trade / Analysis of turnover trends masked by the holiday break European markets had plenty to consider during the traditional August holiday break. The overall 24 per cent fall in turnover for the eight markets covered in the analysis masks the fact that trading was at times extremely volatile, and that rising mayhem in currencies reflected itself in equity markets. Mr James Cornish of County NatWest, who compiles the monthly data, notes that the main reason for the turnover weakness, leaving aside the fact that many equity dealers were on vacation, 'was growing pessimism about European currency unification following French opinion polls pointing strongly, for a time, to a No vote in the referendum. 'Investors stayed away from the potentially weak currency markets, presumably because, even if they had a view on which way the referendum would go, they were unwilling to make a bet on the result.' Belgium was the only market to improve on July figures, advancing by 19 per cent. In a recent review Rachael Rowe of Kleinwort Benson comments that the strong local currency and the lowest inflation in Europe, then around 2 per cent, were the lures attracting an inflow of funds. However, she adds: 'In absolute terms the market performance over the last month has been lacklustre. During the otherwise quiet period attention has focused on Petrofina, following the disappointing interim results mid-month and the weakening dollar. 'General market activity has been so low that trade in the stock has sometimes accounted for around half the daily market volume. With little counteractive positive news to dilute this effect upon the index, the market weakness has been principally due to the slide in that stock price.' Italy saw the month's biggest fall in activity, down almost 50 per cent from July, as the country was almost paralysed by political uncertainty and a deteriorating economy. On one day in the middle of August turnover shrank to L43bn, the lowest level of the year. Activity in Spain also slowed substantially last month, declining by 41 per cent, with daily turnover sometimes slipping as low as Pta5bn, from a reasonably healthy daily average of Pta10bn. This is another market that has been unable to excite inward investment, with foreigners becoming sellers during August. In its overview of the market, James Capel reports that in the three months to the end of August the construction and food sectors were the worst performing areas, underperforming the market as a whole by some 14 per cent. Madrid-based broker FG Inversiones remarks that even a Yes vote in Sunday's French referendum is unlikely to have a dramatic effect as nervousness over the Spanish budget and a further batch of disappointing first-half results overhang the market.  -----------------------------------------------------------------                    EUROPEAN EQUITIES TURNOVER               Monthly total in local currencies (bn)  ----------------------------------------------------------------- Bourse           May      June        Jul       Aug      US                 1992      1992       1992      1992  Dollars bn  ----------------------------------------------------------------- Belgium        40.80     40.57      34.78     41.38      1.14 France        100.16    134.26     100.18     64.52     20.03 Germany       125.80    109.97     121.51    101.72     82.05 Italy       9,747.60  8,594.77  11,975.60  6,039.60     10.70 Netherlands    14.70     12.00      13.10      9.80      7.85 Spain         513.47    515.35     538.64    317.47      5.71 Switzerland    13.29     12.46      10.89      9.01      8.21 UK             35.35     34.05      34.33     26.68     65.85  ----------------------------------------------------------------- Volumes represent purchases and sales.

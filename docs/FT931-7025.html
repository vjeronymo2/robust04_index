			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Leading Article: Italian question WITH EACH passing day, the political crisis in Italy more closely resembles a fin de regime. One by one, some of the highest in the land are toppled by a spreading series of corruption scandals. The political parties that ran the country in shifting anti-communist coalitions during the cold-war decades are discredited to the point of illegitimacy. Top public and private sector company managers find themselves in increasing numbers behind bars. The government teeters and the lira plunges. Beneath it all, a groundswell of public discontent is forcing fundamental political change on to the agenda, and if Italy's ruling class fails to find an adequate response, it may simply be swept away. That change was on the way has been increasingly apparent since general elections delivered an unprecedented rebuke to Italy's established parties last April. The coalition government created in response, under the deputy leader of the Socialist party, Mr Giuliano Amato, set out an ambitious and long overdue programme of economic reform. It has managed  - by political guile and by dint of the weakness of traditional party bosses - not only to survive but to push through a surprising number of changes to Italy's bloated welfare state and its ossified wage-bargaining system. But it always had something of the air of a transitional regime, and that impression has become irresistible in recent weeks. The main reason is the spreading array of investigations into senior politicians and businessmen being conducted by magistrates up and down the land. Emboldened by strong public support, the magistracy has provided detailed evidence of a network of bribery and corruption that reaches into the fabric of Italian political and economic life. The politicians have been paying the price - from Mr Bettino Craxi, who was forced to resign as Socialist leader earlier this month, to the latest casualty, Republican Mr Giorgio La Malfa. As a result of all this, and of the government's own divisions, Mr Amato's government is clearly living on borrowed time. Its sole realistic raison d'etre is now to survive long enough to oversee changes to Italy's voting system that will enable new general elections to be held later this year. Even the shaping of the new system is out of the hands of the established politicians, and will probably be decided by referendum in April. New elections are the only way that Italy will begin to pull itself out of the present morass, and it would make no sense for them to be held under the current system of proportional representation, which has been in some measure responsible for the country's history of weak government. After the proposed plebiscites, Italy will probably end up with a mixed system of first-past-the-post and proportional systems, which at least stands a greater chance of presenting voters with genuine political choices and the possibility of alternance in power. However, such technical changes are only a first, small step towards the more thoroughgoing constitutional, political and economic changes Italy needs, including greater transparency in the operations of its public sector, radical reform of the state budget and of party finances, vigorous privatisation of state assets, and a more sensible distribution of power between central government and the regions. Indeed, tinkering with the electoral system without more broad-based reform could just as easily exacerbate Italy's existing divisions, with the regionalist Lega Nord predominant in the north and the Christian Democrats in the centre and south. The result could be stalemate, further damaging drift on fiscal and other policies, and even ultimately the break-up of the country. Any newly elected Chamber of Deputies and Senate will have to assume the role of a constituent assembly with the task of drafting a new constitution, and confronting the real dilemmas Italy's political system has enabled it to duck for so long. That is what the voters, in the south of the country as much as the north, seem to be ready for.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] United Nations, February 20 (XINHUA) -- UN Special  Envoy Yasushi Akashi said in Zagreb today that he had decided  that it was not necessary to use air power against heavy weapon  positions in and around Sarajevo, capital of Bosnia and  Herzegovina.    In a statement he issued this evening, he said that "I am  satisfied that we have achieved effective compliance with the  requirement to remove or place under UN Protection Force  (UNPROFOR) all heavy weapons within the 20 kilometer Sarajevo  exclusion zone."    Both the Bosnian Government and the Bosnian Serb side, he  said, had been complying with the ceasefire agreement that was  reached on February 9 between the two sides.    Before making the decision, he said, he had consulted with  UN  military commanders in the field, as well as leaders of the  warring parties in Bosnia.    However, he said, "this is only the first step on a very  difficult road, but we are determined to build on this  development to achieve lasting peace for the suffering citizens  of Sarajevo."    In the meantime, he said, UNPROFOR would continue to monitor  compliance and any remaining verification required would be  completed without delay.    "It is my hope," he said, "that the consolidation of a  durable peace in Sarajevo is an example that will be followed in  the other cities and towns of Bosnia and Herzegovina."</p>

			<p><P> April 18, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NBA ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> BULLS CAN'T WIN MIDWEST DIVISION, SO THEY SINK CELTICS' ATLANTIC HOPES  </P> <P> The Chicago Bulls' bid to overtake the Detroit Pistons in the Central Division  fell short, so they took it out on the Boston Celtics.  </P> <P> Michael Jordan scored 35 points at Chicago Tuesday night to lead the Bulls to a  111-105 victory. They not only ended the Celtics' six-game winning streak, but  the Bulls just about crushed the Celtics' hopes to beat Philadelphia in the  Atlantic Division.  </P> <P> The Celtics, two games behind the 76ers with only three games remaining, never  had a lead. The closest they came was 105-104, on a fast-break basket by John  Paxson with 25 seconds left.  </P> <P> But Scottie Pippen sank two free throws and Jordan sank a three-point basket to  end the Celtics' hopes.  </P> <P> The Celtics, who fought back from a 16-point deficit, were led by Kevin McHale  with 28 points.  </P> <P> Dallas 97, Utah 96 -- The one division still up for grabs is the Midwest. The  showdown is tonight when Utah, leading the Spurs by a game, plays at San  Antonio.  </P> <P> In this one at Dallas, the Mavericks almost blew a 15-point lead in the last  quarter. The Jazz, with Karl Malone getting 39 points and 17 rebounds, fought  back resolutely.  </P> <P> With his team leading only 97-96, Derek Harper, who had 24 points for the  Mavericks, tossed up an airball trying for a three-pointer with 20 seconds  remaining.  </P> <P> The Jazz tried for a last shot, were unable to communicate and when Thurl  Bailey sank an 18-footer, the final buzzer had already sounded.  </P> <P> Malone was disgusted. "We just blew our biggest game of the season," he said.  "We controlled our own destiny and we didn't come through. The game was there  for us."  </P> <P> The Mavericks, apparently thinking they had the game won when they led by 21  points in the first half, relaxed, almost too soon.  </P> <P> Houston 112, Sacramento 97 -- Sleepy Floyd scored 15 of his 22 points in the  fourth quarter at Houston and the Rockets took possession of eighth place in  the West.  </P> <P> Seattle's tough loss at home to the Lakers put the Rockets a game in front.  Each team has three games to play. The Rockets host Denver, which has not  clinched the seventh spot in the West, visit Dallas and close out at home with  Utah. The SuperSonics play at Sacramento and Golden State and meet the Clippers  at home.  </P> <P> The Rockets had to come from behind without the help of Akeem Olajuwon. Early  in the third quarter Olajuwon and Greg Kite of the Kings traded punches and  both were ejected.  </P> <P> Denver 99, Minnesota 89 -- The expansion Timberwolves drew 49,551 fans at the  Metrodome and broke the season attendance record -- drawing 1,072,578 fans --  but the Nuggets scored a big victory.  </P> <P> Fat Lever scored 10 of his 21 points in the final 4:44 as the Nuggets pulled  out the victory with an 18-6 run.  </P> <P> The Nuggets have a 41-38 record. Houston has a 40-39 record and Seattle is  39-40. In their last three games, the Nuggets play at Houston and at home  against San Antonio and Minnesota.  </P> <P> Cleveland 96, Milwaukee 88 -- It was the biggest road game of the season for  the Cavaliers and they turned it on in the fourth quarter to beat the Bucks.  </P> <P> John (Hot Rod) Williams played the starring role. Williams scored five of his  19 points in a 7-0 run at the start of the last quarter that gave the Cavaliers  a five-point lead.  </P> <P> The Cavaliers need to win two of their last three to clinch the last playoff  spot in the East. They play at New Jersey, at Orlando and are home to New York.  </P> <P> Atlanta 118, New Jersey 95 -- Dominique Wilkins scored 10 of his 36 points in  the first eight minutes of the fourth quarter and the Hawks broke open a tight  game at Atlanta.  </P> <P> The victory kept the Hawks' playoff hopes alive. The Hawks are trailing  Cleveland by half a game in the battle for the eighth and final playoff spot in  the East.  </P> <P> However, even if the Hawks win their last two games, they will not make the  playoffs unless the Cavaliers lose two of their last three. If the two teams  tie, Cleveland makes the playoffs.  </P> <P> Washington 129, Orlando 127 -- Bernard King's jump shot with less than two  seconds remaining at Orlando saved the Bullets. King had 32 points and a  career-high 14 assists. DAN HAFNER  </P></p>

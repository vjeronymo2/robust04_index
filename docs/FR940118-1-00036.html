			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to the NCP in 40 CFR 300.425(c), this document proposes to add 26 sites to the NPL. The General Superfund Section includes 1,069 sites, and the Federal Facilities Section includes 123 sites, for a total of 1,192 sites on the NPL. Final and proposed sites now total 1,289. These numbers reflect EPA's decision to voluntarily remove the Hexcel Corporation site, in Livermore, CA, from the NPL.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Public Comment Period  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The documents that form the basis for EPA's evaluation and scoring of sites in this rule, as well as the health advisories issued by ATSDR and documentation supporting the designation as a State top priority, where applicable, are contained in dockets located both at EPA Headquarters and in the appropriate Regional offices.

(Stratford, Connecticut), Lower Ecorse Creek Dump (Wyandotte, Michigan), and Tennessee Products (Chanttanooga, Tennessee) which are sites being proposed based on the ATSDR health advisory criteria, and Boomsnub/Airco (Vancouver, Washington) which has been designated as a State top priority, the Headquarters docket for this rule contains HRS score sheets for each proposed site; a Documentation Record for each site describing the information used to compute the score; pertinent information for any site affected by particular statutory requirements or EPA listing policies; and a list of documents referenced in the Documentation Record. Each Regional docket for this rule, except for the three ATSDR health advisory sites and the State top priority mentioned above, contains all of the information in the Headquarters docket for sites in that Region, plus the actual reference documents containing the data principally relied upon and cited by EPA in calculating or evaluating the HRS scores for sites in that Region. These reference documents are available only in the Regional dockets. For the three sites proposed on the basis of health advisory criteria, both the Headquarters and Regional dockets contain the public health advisories issued by ATSDR, and EPA memoranda supporting the findings that in each case the release poses a significant threat to public health and that it would be more cost-effective to use remedial rather than removal authorities at the site. For the site that has been designated a top priority by the State, both the Headquarters and Regional dockets contain supporting documentation. Interested parties may view documents, by appointment only, in the Headquarters or the appropriate Regional docket or copies may be requested from the Headquarters or appropriate Regional docket. An informal written request, rather than a formal request under the Freedom of Information Act, should be the ordinary procedure for obtaining copies of any of these documents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA considers all comments received during the comment period. During the comment period, comments are placed in the Headquarters docket and are available to the public on an ``as received'' basis. A complete set of comments will be available for viewing in the Regional docket approximately one week after the formal comment period closes. Comments received after the comment period closes will be available in the Headquarters docket and in the Regional docket on an ``as received'' basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

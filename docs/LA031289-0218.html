			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WEATHER FORECAST: IT'S IN THE (TIMES) BAG  </P> <P> Re meteorology-Orange County: I am bemused by the weather antics on television  of Doctor George, Willard Scott, et al., as they are almost invariably "wrong."  </P> <P> For the 20 years I have lived in Anaheim, Orange, Irvine and Newport Beach, I  have found a far more reliable forecaster of weather: my Los Angeles Times  delivery person!  </P> <P> If, when I walk out to the driveway to retrieve my Times, it is in a plastic  cover, I know we will have rain in the near future -- and dress accordingly.  </P> <P> If the good doctor and Willard forecast rain, and my Times is unwrapped, I  dress for a fine and clear day.  </P> <P> It works. Try it!  </P> <P> WARREN ISHAM  </P> <P> Orange  </P></p>

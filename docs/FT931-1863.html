			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Consumer optimism rising, says poll CONFIDENCE ABOUT the general economic situation has risen slightly this month, but pessimists continue to outweigh optimists, the latest Gallup survey of consumer confidence showed yesterday, Emma Tucker writes. The survey, conducted in the first two weeks of the month, found that 40 per cent of the 2,025 adults sampled believed the economic situation would worsen over the next 12 months against 27 per cent who believed it would improve. The difference between the two figures was one of the lowest since July last year. Twenty-six per cent expected their household's financial position to worsen this year while 20 per cent expected it to improve. The results of the survey point to a fragile improvement in consumer confidence, but it is too early to judge the impact of the Budget on sentiment. Fear of unemployment continues to damp optimism, however, with 76 per cent of the survey's respondents expecting unemployment to rise in the 12 months ahead.</p>

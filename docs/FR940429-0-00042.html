The purpose of the Secretary's recognition of accrediting agencies is to assure that those agencies are, for HEA and other Federal purposes, reliable authorities as to the quality of education or training offered by the institutions of higher education or higher education programs they accredit. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  These regulations take effect on July 1, 1994, with the exception of &sect;&sect;602.4, 602.10, and 602.27.

Under the HEA and many other Federal statutes, one element of that definition requires an eligible institution of higher education to be accredited or preaccredited by an accrediting agency recognized by the Secretary as a reliable authority as to the quality of the education or training provided by the institution. Another element requires an eligible institution to be legally authorized to provide an education program beyond the secondary level in the State in which it is located. In addition, to participate in the Title IV, HEA programs, the institution must be certified by the Secretary as administratively capable and financially responsible. Thus, the HEA provides the framework for a shared responsibility among accrediting agencies, States, and the Federal government to ensure that the ``gate'' to Title IV, HEA programs is opened only to those institutions that provide students with quality education or training worth the time, energy, and money they invest in it. The three ``gatekeepers'' sharing this responsibility have traditionally been referred to as ``the triad.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> While the concept of a triad of entities responsible for gatekeeping has had a long history, originating in 1952, the Higher Education Amendments of 1992, Public Law 102&hyph;325, significantly increased the gatekeeping responsibilities of each member of the triad. Specifically, Congress amended the HEA to provide for a new part H of Title IV entitled ``Program Integrity Triad.'' Under the new part H, the requirements that accrediting bodies must meet if they are to be recognized by the Secretary as ``gatekeepers'' for Title IV or other Federal purposes are specified in detail. Part H also provides a new oversight responsibility for States: The State Postsecondary Review Program. Altogether, part H establishes a set of responsibilities for accrediting agencies, States, and the Secretary that creates a stronger and more coordinated evaluation of institutions that participate, or wish to participate, in the Title IV, HEA programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG -->  <!-- PJG /FTAG --></p>

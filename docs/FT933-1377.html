			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Liberal Democrats at Torquay: Ashdown warns of need to face challenge IF THE Liberal Democrats can rise to the challenge of recent successes, there need be no limit to its potential support, Mr Paddy Ashdown told the conference yesterday. But the leader said the party had to be prepared for fierce scrutiny of its plans now that it was on the verge of the political 'big time'. In his 43-minute keynote speech, he also launched a fierce attack on the Conservatives, saying: 'It is as if we now have an empty room in No 10 Downing Street, as though we have a phantom prime minister.' Mr Ashdown's central message was that the party had a chance to build on the hope which it alone inspired in a society in which there was a dangerous gulf between politicians and people. But he tempered his optimism with a warning that the whole party could be damaged by mistakes in local campaigns and local authorities. His comments were seen as referring to the tactics of local activists in the London borough of Tower Hamlets. The party is investigating leaflets issued by Liberal Democrats in the recent council by-election, won by the far right British National Party. 'Hope is a fragile thing,' Mr Ashdown said. 'It will be as easy for us to lose as it was hard for us to win. 'If we fail to live up to this opportunity, then this year's success will be no more than just another third-party surge which rises and dies again . . . but if we can rise to the challenge, if we can seize our opportunity, then I promise you there is no 'glass ceiling' for the Liberal Democrats.' Mr Ashdown portrayed the party's economic stance as a response to the widespread lack of trust in government. New ways were needed to involve taxpayers in deciding how much tax should be raised and how it should be spent. 'No taxation without explanation,' Mr Ashdown said. But his most bitter attack on the government came over its conduct of foreign policy, and in particular Bosnia in the former Yugoslavia, where he accused it of appeasement. Later, Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, branded Mr Ashdown a 'political tourist' who 'trots round the tragedy in Bosnia, comes back and makes a speech and grabs a headline'. Though Mr Ashdown insists that the Liberal Democrats are 'equidistant' between the other two parties, his sustained attack on the Conservatives contrasted with the tone of his remarks about Labour. Mr Ashdown said that Labour had wasted a year in making moves towards internal democracy and warned the party that the move towards reform would not wait for it indefinitely.

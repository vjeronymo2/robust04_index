			<p><P> March 15, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: SANTA PAULA;  </P> <P> SCHOOL BOARD SCRAPS BUSINESS SERVICES JOB  </P> <P> The Santa Paula Union High School District Board of Trustees, in an effort to  comply with state and county recommendations, has unanimously voted to  eliminate the position of assistant superintendent for business services as of  June 30.  </P> <P> About 30 members of the community attended a meeting Tuesday to show their  support for Robert Villa, who holds the job, and to try to persuade the board  to vote in favor of retaining him.  </P> <P> Rachel Bustillos, local California School Employees Assn. president, who said  she spoke for those assembled, stated that she found it "hard to understand  some of the things the board does. . . . Is this the reward for doing a good  job?"  </P> <P> Hope Mata, an instructional aide, said: "We so quickly forget and make  decisions that affect how we feel here at school. Is this a vendetta? I don't  think so , but consider all he has done for the district. . . . He handled so  many jobs under pressure and didn't give up. Make your decision in good  conscience."  </P> <P> Board member Donna Nelson replied that the decision was by no means a vendetta,  and added that all the members appreciate Villa's work.  </P> <P> "I would have been lost without him," Nelson said. She explained the move as  simply cost-effective, saying no district the size of Santa Paula can afford to  support three top administrative posts. The other two are principal and  superintendent.

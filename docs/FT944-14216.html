			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / World Bond Markets: Political risk migrates across the Rhine  -Government issues Following Germany's elections last week, political risk has migrated across the Rhine to France, where it is spooking bond and currency markets as the presidential elections loom. But while the risk premium of French over German government bonds is likely to increase further, that trend is likely to be reversed after the May elections, leading to a period of out-performance by the French bond market. The yield spread of 10-year French government bonds - Obligations Assimilables du Tresor - over Germany's bunds widened to 74 basis points on Friday from 59 a week before and eight basis points at the start of the year. 'Although we still have political uncertainty in Germany, it is much reduced now that we know (Chancellor Helmut) Kohl has the majority,' says Mr Troy Bowler, bond strategist at PaineWebber. In relative terms, France has become a worse bet, he says: not only does it face the uncertainty of elections, but it has been shaken by scandals surrounding government ministers, and by squabbling within Prime Minister Edouard Balladur's right-wing RPR over the presidential candidacy. No candidates have formally declared themselves, but informal campaigning has begun - especially in the right-wing camp, where Mr Balladur and Mr Jacques Chirac, the RPR leader, are battling for the candidacy. Meanwhile, it is widely assumed that Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission President until year-end, will run for the Socialist Party. The first round of voting will take place on April 23 1995, with the final polling scheduled for May 7. If Mr Balladur runs and wins, the markets would respond well, with the current policy framework confirmed, says Mr John Hall, economist at Swiss Bank Corporation. Similarly, a Delors victory would entail few risks, given his commitment to the 'Franc Fort' policy, fast-track EMU and adherence to the Maastricht convergence criteria. A Chirac win could cause greater concern, given the aggressive demands he has made for changes in policies. However, 'in reality he has said little which would change the French approach to EMU,' says Mr Hall. Moreover, recent opinion polls leave Mr Chirac looking like an unlikely candidate for the right. Another risk factor would be early elections if President Francois Mitterrand's health continued to worsen, which would mean elections must be held within 35 days - possibly too soon for Mr Balladur to regain his political footing. Politics are not the only factor weighing on OATs: the weak US dollar has exerted heavy pressure on the franc against the D-Mark, further depressing the bond market. Moreover, OATs tend to under-perform bunds in a bear market and out-perform them on the way up - and bunds have weakened lately. 'The direction of bunds is important for the OAT-bund spread - if they continue to sell off, that could push the spread out further,' says Mr Bowler, who says the gap may widen to 100 basis points. According to Mr Steven Major, head of bond research at Credit Lyonnais, politics, liquidity considerations and the volatility profile of the German market favour bunds over OATs. Chart-technically, too, OATs may be vulnerable to further yield spread widening if the spread breaks out of its long-term downtrend, he warns. On the other hand, France's inflation fundamentals, its supply situation and budgetary outlook tend to favour OATs, and will support them eventually, he says. According to Mr Dominique Barbet of Banque Paribas, France's budgetary outlook will improve, regardless of who wins the elections. 'You don't see politicians saying they'll raise taxes or cut spending, but French market participants are saying they will have to do both,' he says. He expects the yield gap to widen towards 80 basis points but to start shrinking once the presidential candidates become known in early January. In the run-up to the elections, the market is likely to be very volatile but price action is likely to reflect electoral uncertainty rather than serious threats to French policy. Thus, with the spread set to narrow after the elections, investors should use periods of weakness to position themselves for that contraction, says SBC's Mr Hall. 'Once the election uncertainty is removed we will probably see the OAT-bund spread rallying well,' he predicts, setting a medium-term target of 30 basis points.</p>

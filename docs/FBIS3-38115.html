			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [George Jones and Sonia Purnell article: "State Accused of </F> Wasting Millions"]    [Text] Mr Major was forced further on to the defensive  over standards in public life yesterday by the publication of a  report cataloguing the waste of hundreds of millions of pounds  of taxpayers' money. The unprecedented report from the Public  Accounts Committee said recent failings represented a departure  from the "standards of public conduct" established during the  past 140 years.    During heated exchanges in the Commons, Mr Major denied  there  had been any decline in standards, while Mr Smith the Labour  leader described the report as a "devastating catalogue of  incompetence, mismanagement and waste of public money."    The all-party committee of MPs outlined 26 cases of  financial  failures and mismanagement in Whitehall departments and official  quangos [quasiautonomous national government organization].    These ranged from inadequate financial controls in the  Foreign Office in 1989 which created a climate "conducive to  fraud and theft," to the expenditure by Wessex Regional Health  Authority of up to 1 million pounds more than necessary on a  computer.    It was the first time the committee -- a watchdog on  Government spending -- has published such a report in its  133-year history. It was compiled against a background of  radical reform in the National Health Service and other public  bodies, with officials under increasing pressure to adopt a more  businesslike approach to the provision of services.    The committee's criticisms have intensified Mr Major's  difficulties in restoring the Government's reputation after a  series of political and financial scandals involving Tory  politicians and the disclosures of Lord Justice Scott's inquiry  into the arms-for-Iraq affair.    Earlier this week the crossparty Commons Foreign Affairs  Committee decided to investigate the award of 234 million pounds  of Government aid to the Pergau dam project in Malaysia against  the advice of senior civil servants .    Mr Major will underline the Government's commitment to high  standards of public life in a keynote speech tonight setting out  his priorities for the coming year. But there is concern that  the report will give the Labour leadership valuable ammunition  in its campaign to highlight governmental "sleaze" and broken  election promises on taxation.    There was laughter from Labour MPs when Mr Major said he  welcomed the report because it provided a "useful checklist" to  help public bodies to avoid wasting money in future .    He denied there had been a decline in standards, and was  visibly annoyed when Mr Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, said  people were being asked to pay unprecedented levels of taxation  only to see the Government and quangos throw money away on  "waste corruption and fraud."    Thumping his notes down on the Dispatch Box, Mr Major  challenged Mr Ashdown to substantiate his allegations .    Earlier, Mr Robert Sheldon, Labour MP for Ashton under Lyne  and chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, said the  situation they had uncovered was getting worse.    The gravity of the report was underlined by a Conservative  committee member, Mr Richard Page, who said it should not be a  party political issue. "Because there have been frauds, because  there have been misdemeanors, this is a clear shot across the  bows for every Government department and every Government  agency," he said.    Labour MPs immediately., seized on the report to attack  Government reforms. Mr Michael Meacher, Labour's spokesman on  the public services, blamed the failings on bringing outsiders  into public office and the prevalent "business culture and  political climate of greed and self-interest."    Mr Waldegrave, the minister responsible for public services,  acknowledged the report had shown up some "very bad examples."  But he said the committee did not believe there was a  contradiction between the Government's changes and the  maintenance of proper standards.    It said: "Some allege that the drive for economy and  efficiency must be held back to some extent because of the need  to take specific care with public money. Others argue that if  economy and efficiency are to be forcibly pursued, then  traditional standards must be relaxed. We firmly reject both  claims."    The report noted that sweeping reforms of the Civil Service,  intended to improve efficiency through greater delegation and a  more entrepreneurial approach, had been accompanied by serious  failures in financial and administrative control and  accountability, as well as a collapse in traditional public  sector values.    "Apart from the important moral and other aspects involved,  we consider that any failure to respect and care for public  money would be a most important cause of a decline in the  efficiency of public business," it said.    At a time of great change honesty should not be neglected in  the effort to maximise economy and efficiency. It demanded  effective systems of control and accountability and "above all  responsible attitudes on the part of those handling money."    It called for the National Audit Office's powers to be  extended to enable it to examine all bodies that received most  of their income from public funds.    The report includes a checklist of procedures for Government  departments, including systematic checking of bills; making sure  no ex gratia payments are made to staff who should have been  dismissed; tighter rules on the provision of cars; ensuring  effective personal accountability; avoiding conflicts of  interest in awarding contracts; regular assessment of  expenditure programmes and greater openness.</p>

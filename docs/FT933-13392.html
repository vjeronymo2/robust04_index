			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / World Trade News: UK groups ply for Turkish contracts BRITISH defence companies will be making a renewed pitch for contracts during today's visit to Turkey of Mr Richard Needham, the UK trade minister. Credit proposals for Turkey's Dollars 400m (Pounds 266.6m) mine hunter vessel contract have to be submitted today. Vosper Thornycroft, of Southampton, is competing to win the largest defence contract tendered by the Turkish armed forces this year. The contract for six mine hunters is an integrated bid. Vosper's proposal includes Marconi's 2093 sonar and its Nautis command and control system. Also bidding are Direction des Constructions Navales of France, Germany's Abeking &amp; Rasmussen and Luerssen Werft, and Intermarine of Italy. Vosper's bid, with that of DCN and Intermarine, involves a glass-reinforced plastic hull, while the Germans are offering a non-magnetic steel hull. Vosper's Sandown type vessel is already in service with the Royal Navy. Initial bids were submitted on July 8. However, an early decision may be delayed following a reshuffle in SSM, the Turkish defence procurement agency, with the dismissal last week of Defence Under-Secretary Vahit Erdem. An earlier possibility is the contract for fire control systems for the 35mm anti-aircraft gun. Marconi, together with Racal, is bidding to supply its Eagle system in a contract worth an estimated Dollars 200m. The UK company is competing against Contraves of Switzerland and a Dutch-French venture between Thompson CSF and Holland Signal. Also under evaluation are bids for the Dollars 1bn Turkish Armed Forces Integrated Communications System. The UK subsidiary of Northern Telcom of Canada is offering its Savkom system. If successful, UK companies are expected to pick up substantial sub-contract work.</p>

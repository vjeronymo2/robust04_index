			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Arts: Murder and verse - TS Eliot in Stratford THERE IS a lot of murder in Stratford this week: the murder of TS Eliot's marvellous verse. It is not just manslaughter. This is clearly a coldly, carefully premeditated act. Where Eliot wrote for a verse-speaking, fatalistic chorus, the women of Canterbury now affect a kind of naturalistic prose. On the other hand, there is a very understandable motive. Murder In The Cathedral, written in 1935, was Eliot's first play. In a memorable essay nearly 20 years later Eliot admitted that it had not solved the problem of reinventing verse drama. For Murder is more of a pageant and a ritual than a genuine play. It was designed for the Canterbury Festival and is still usually performed in a cathedral. The unmistakeable echoes you hear in it are those of Eliot's poetry, not of his later dramatic work. Nevertheless, two substantial sections of Murder In The Cathedral are in prose. One is the archbishop's sermon on Christmas Day when he prophecies his own death. The other is the attempted justification by the knights of why Becket had to be killed. This latter part is almost Shavian and involves the knights in a direct engagement with the audience, pleading their cause as plain, blunt Englishmen while the body of Becket lies bloodily before them. They murdered the archbishop because, in the interests of efficient government, it was necessary to choose between the powers of church and state. That is the scene which dominates Steven Pimlott's production. The knights have a case which it would be artificial to put in verse. They are witnesses addressing a jury, not part of a pageant. Quite why they are dressed as parodies of SAS commandos is another matter. Some of the lines are remarkably modern. For instance: 'Our king saw that the one thing needful was to restore order: to curb the excessive powers of local government, which were usually exercised for selfish and often for seditious ends.' Eliot emerges here as an effective writer of prose drama, catching precisely that diffident way some Englishmen have of taking to public speaking. They even have names like old Tory MP's, such as Reginald Fitz Urse. Guy Henry, as knight number 2, is the best of a very good quartet. Whether the earlier sacrifice of the verse was worth making for the sake of getting down to the politics later is more questionable. I think that Pimlott should have recognised the exceptional nature of the piece. It falls into separate parts. The verse-speaking of the chorus is essential to emphasise the ritual, the sense that the women are impotent to influence what goes on around them. Pimlott tries to differentiate between them, splitting up the lines and seldom letting them speak in unison. He does the same thing with the priests, clearly implying that one of them is gay - note Becket's firm kiss on the lips - and that another is a potential defector. Yet in the end the priests, like the chorus, stick together. Becket is played by Michael Feast: he would be better under more mature direction. Those who know Murder In The Cathedral largely from reading and an admiration of Eliot's poetry are liable to be disappointed, yet there are scenes, such as the knights, which make it worth seeing.

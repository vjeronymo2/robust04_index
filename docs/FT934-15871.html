			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / BAe confident on Taiwan deal British Aerospace said yesterday it was confident that a long-delayed joint venture with Taiwan Aerospace Corporation (TAC) to build regional jets would go ahead, writes Daniel Green. It said one of the causes of the hold-ups had been the disruption to the command structure at TAC culminating in the resignation of its president, Mr Denny Ko, last week. Mr Ko had signed the original agreement with BAe in January to create the joint venture company, called Avro. BAe is trying to restart talks to bridge remaining differences between the two sides later this month. Taiwan wants to enter civil aerospace as part of its industrial policy, but opposition politicians have attacked the proposed venture on commercial grounds. TAC's board next meets on October 19 and the government indicated this week that it would leave the decision on Avro to the board.</p>

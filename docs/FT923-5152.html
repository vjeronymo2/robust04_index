			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / International Company News: SA Brewing earnings rise SA BREWING, the Australian drinks, food and manufacturing group, unveiled an increase of 11 per cent in net profits to ADollars 113m (USDollars 86.9m) for the year to end-June, on sales up 4.6 per cent to ADollars 2bn. The result marks the third consecutive year of earnings growth for SA Brewing, which has defied Australia's recession and slow recovery with improvements of 21 per cent in 1990 and 15 per cent last year. The group raised the final dividend to 7.75 cents from 7.5 cents, making a total of 15.5 cents, fully franked, against 15.25 the previous year. SA Brewing said the improvement in sales revenue was largely due to a 22 per cent improvement in the beverage and food division. Mr Ross Wilson, managing director, said the result was 'excellent' given difficult trading conditions. But he warned the current year would be difficult because there were no signs of recovery in the domestic economy. He said SA Brewing's wine and water heater businesses, both of which have international markets, would provide the group's 'primary growth' over the next 12 to 18 months.</p>

			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNCIL PUTS HOLD ON THEATER CENTER FUNDS  </P> <P> The City Council has tentatively decided to withhold nearly $1 million that  would enable the Los Angeles Theater Center to keep its doors open through  January.  </P> <P> After much discussion, the council voted 7 to 5 on Tuesday to withhold the  funding until it sees a report by a commission charged with reviewing the  theater's long-term financial future.  </P> <P> The money -- $998,000 -- is necessary to keep the theater in downtown Los  Angeles operating through its current fall/winter season.  </P> <P> But Bill Bushnell, LATC artistic director, said the theater has been using  reserve funds to cover expenses until funding is approved.  </P> <P> The much-awaited report by a review panel named by Mayor Tom Bradley is  expected to recommend some variation of a plan in which the city would acquire  the LATC's Spring Street building, with the existing production company  becoming the leading member of a larger group of performers.  </P></p>

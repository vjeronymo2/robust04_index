			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Election 1992 Preview: The decline of the true party believer - David Butler analyses how elections have changed Democracies the world over complain of the Americanisation of campaigning. Most recent innovations have their origins in the fertile world of US politics and advertising. Private opinion polling and professional campaign advisers; photo-opportunities and sound-bites; image-making and negative campaigning evolved across the Atlantic. Dirty tricks - and their exposure - are peculiarly associated with Washington. But there is nothing new under the sun. Last century, Gladstone was the focus of a notable image-making industry. The Liberal campaign of 1905 was remarkable for its knocking copy. Even the manipulation of the economy to coincide with the electoral cycle is not new: as Lord Brougham wrote to Thomas Creevey in 1816: 'A government is not supported a hundredth part so much by the constant, uniform, quiet prosperity of the country as by those damned spurts that Pitt used to have just in the nick of time.' Nevertheless, election campaigns have been transformed in the past 40 years. The law regulating their conduct is virtually unchanged. The goal of victory is still central to the contenders. But what they do to persuade us to vote for them is quite different. In 1950, the time-honoured rituals of canvassing and evening meetings were observed almost everywhere. A total of 40 per cent of voters in the UK remembered going to a meeting, and more than 50 per cent recalled being canvassed. In 1987, only 3 per cent went to a meeting and only 20 per cent were canvassed. The BBC excluded all reference to the election from its news in 1950. Full broadcast coverage arrived only in 1959 but, by 1964, 80 per cent of people said they received most of their information about politics from television. The parties responded. In 1950, election news was made by the rival party leaders, Winston Churchill and Clement Attlee, making evening speeches at big rallies, designed for headlines in the morning newspapers next day. Today the party leaders work an 18-hour day, trying to provide the lead story for successive bulletins from breakfast TV to the midnight news. They also put inordinate effort into their party election broadcasts. National press advertising, thought illegal in 1950, now absorbs two-thirds of national campaign expenditure - in 1987, its cost exceeded total spending by all candidates in the constituencies. Advertising consultants have always been there, but their role has expanded. The Tories with Saatchi &amp; Saatchi and Labour with its Shadow Communications Agency have advisers involved in daily discussions of tactics and publicity. Over the last generation, then, campaigning has become far more complex and sophisticated. But have the new techniques affected the voter? Volatility has increased both between and during campaigns. From 1945 to 1965 only one by-election in 12 led to a switch in party control; since 1965, one by-election in three has done so. The 1950s fluctuations in the monthly opinion polls were minimal; now the party lead often goes up or down by 10 percentage points or more. Thirty years ago, 50 per cent of people described themselves as 'very strongly' attached to one party; now only 20 per cent do so. The greater fluidity of society and the disillusionment with all politicians in a period of national decline are part of the reason. But there are two other explanations: First, the re-emergence of the Liberals: it is only since 1974 that the Liberals returned to the major league. By offering a candidate in every constituency, they have given disillusioned Tory and Labour supporters a half-way house. Tactical voting has eroded two-party solidarity. Second, the coming of television as the prime source of political communication. Argument in the TV studio has to be much less raucous than in the House of Commons. Voters learn that there is less difference between the parties and their spokesmen than seemed the case when a single opinionated newspaper provided the information. In 1992, it is much harder than a generation or two ago for a voter to be a true believer, to see his or her party as having a monopoly on wisdom, care and patriotism. Campaigns have also lengthened. Although they last a formal 23 days from dissolution to voting, the national struggle casts a shadow well beforehand. All party politics involves electioneering, but it has never been so explicit as in the last few months. During April to September 1964, at the end of the only other full-term parliament, there was an oasis of tranquillity compared with the carefully orchestrated point-scoring of the last two months. The closer the parties are on main policy, the more they must turn to minor issues and mud-slinging to differentiate themselves in the eyes of the electorate. Elections have altered, too, thanks to population movements and attitude changes. There used to be many more marginal seats, and party strengths were more evenly spread about the country. From 1945 to 1970 each election yielded about 180 marginal seats (with a majority of less than 20 per cent). About 18 seats used to change hands for each 1 per cent swing from Conservative to Labour or vice versa, making a difference of 36 to the net majority in parliament. But since the 1970s, the number of marginals has plummeted to 80 or less; a 1 per cent swing now yields only eight changes of control. If the election system had worked in 1983 as it did in 1959, former prime minister Mrs Margaret Thatcher would have had a majority of almost 300 instead of a mere 146. The reason for this revolution in electoral arithmetic is that the Conservatives have lost almost all their inner-city and Scottish seats to Labour, while Labour has been ousted from suburban and rural areas. In 1945, the Conservatives won a majority of votes in both Glasgow and Liverpool: now they do not have a single seat in either city. In 1945, Labour won half the agricultural seats in East Anglia; now they have sunk to third place in all but one. And in 1955, the Conservatives held a majority of the seats in Scotland; now they have only nine out of 72. The polarisation of constituencies and the disappearance of marginals means that elections are less likely to produce landslides. Even in a bad year more incumbents are likely to hold on to their seats. The electorate is different now from the one that put Labour in power in 1945. Every year, about 2 per cent die and 2 per cent come of age. At least 5 per cent of the native-born population has emigrated; 5 per cent of voters are of New Commonwealth stock. Moreover the growth in ownership of houses and other material assets, and the increase in education, have combined with the decline in manual occupations to reduce the natural base for the Labour party. The decline in the Labour vote from 48 per cent in 1945-51 to 30 per cent in the 1980s owes more to changes in society than to the ineptitude of its leaders. But Labour is still the party of the working class, even though its hold has been much weakened. The only major categories of voter that gave more than 50 per cent support to the Labour party were council tenants and those of New Commonwealth origin. A different electorate, a different operation of the electoral system, and a very different style of campaigning - the last generation has seen a revolution in the nature of British democracy. Fewer seats change hands for each 1 per cent of swing. But more voters are ready to change. The highly orchestrated campaigns, or the chance banana skins of the next few years, have an unrivalled opportunity to switch the outcome of the election.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- CHANGING FACE OF THE UK  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                             1950        1991/2  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Number on electorial register                34m           43m GDP per head (in constant terms)             100           239 Value of Pound                          Pounds 1            7p Owner-occupied homes                         28%           67% Adults owning shares                          7%           24% Households with television                   10%           98% Car in household                             12%           65% Telephone in household                       12%           85% Still at school over 14                      40%          100% 17-19 age group entering higher education     6%           16% Population over 65                           10%           17% Of New Commonwealth origin                  0.5%            5% Employed in manual jobs                      65%           47% Employed in manufacturing or mining          39%           23% Unemployed                                  1.5%            9%  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> November 2, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> HARDEMAN SPARS WITH 2 COLLEAGUES, SEES 2 INITIATIVES DEFEATED  </P> <P> Inglewood Councilman Garland Hardeman, who pledged during his recent campaign  to bring new life to the City Council, saw two of his initiatives shot down  Tuesday after spirited exchanges with two political rivals.  </P> <P> Mayor Edward Vincent refused to appoint four commissioners nominated by  Hardeman, prompting the new councilman to complain that he has a right to  appoint commissioners in his council district.  </P> <P> After the meeting, Vincent said that one of the nominees, Terry Coleman, is too  critical of the city and that the others were proposed only to replace  nominations made by former Councilman Ervin (Tony) Thomas, whom Hardeman  defeated Oct. 3 after a bitter two-year legal and electoral battle.  </P> <P> "The city commissions are set up to help the city, not for people's private  political needs," Vincent said. "Hardeman's been on the council for two  meetings. How does he know how the current commissioners function?"  </P> <P> Hardeman also clashed with Councilman Anthony Scardenzan, a former Hardeman  ally who has since become a fierce political opponent.  </P> <P> Scardenzan teamed up with Vincent and Councilman Jose Fernandez to defeat a  Hardeman proposal to change the time of council meetings from 1:30 to 3:30 p.m.  </P> <P> Hardeman, whose measure was supported by Councilman Daniel Tabor, said the  change was aimed at drawing more people to meetings, but Scardenzan and the  mayor said the measure was a personal move to accommodate Hardeman's schedule.  </P> <P> Fernandez said he did not support the time change Tuesday to give council  members more time to resolve the issue.  </P> <P> In another clash, Scardenzan questioned whether the city should pay for the  refreshments served during a reception held in City Hall two weeks ago, before  Hardeman was sworn into office.  </P> <P> Hardeman responded with a personal jab at Scardenzan, who had said during the  campaign that he would resign his own council seat if Hardeman was elected.  </P> <P> "Scardenzan said if I was elected he would resign. . . . I see that he has not  honored what he said he would do," Hardeman said.  </P> <P> Scardenzan said after the meeting that he had decided to stay on the council  because he received telephone calls from supporters urging him not to resign.  </P> <P> Although Scardenzan has vowed not to speak to Hardeman, both men said in  interviews that they do not think their conflict will interfere with city  business.  </P> <P> Vincent, who fought to keep Hardeman from winning a council seat, said he sees  himself in a new role of peacemaker.  </P> <P> "I think there will be dissension, but neither Garland nor Tony will stop the  progress in this city," he said.  </P></p>

			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Caterpillar offers staff de-recognition deal Caterpillar (UK), the subsid-iary of the world's largest manufacturer of earth moving and construction equipment, is asking white-collar staff to give up collective bargaining and accept de-recognition of their unions in return for lump-sum payments of Pounds 500 plus a 2 per cent pay rise. Officials of the unions concerned - the MSF technical union and the Apex white-collar section of the GMB general union - fear that if Caterpillar succeeds with its non-union strategy, other engineering companies will follow its example. 'We are worried this could have a bandwagon effect,' said one union official. Caterpillar is a member of the Engineering Employers Federation, which the unions say has advised the company. Senior technical staff members of MSF at the company's Desford digging-machinery plant outside Leicester agreed this week to accept the company's proposal by a majority of 80 per cent to 20 per cent in a secret workplace ballot. Caterpillar intends to give workers individual contracts of employment and to introduce an incentive compensation plan relating future pay to individual performance, with the possibility of wage increases of up to 14 per cent. A staff council is to be established, without negotiating rights, together with a company legal protection plan to provide staff with legal advice. Staff will also receive in-house medical check-ups. Apex is to ballot Caterpillar clerical staff on the deal next week, and MSF will ballot the rest of the technical grades. Both recommend rejection. The company's 600 manual workers - members of the AEEU engineering and electrical union - are expected to receive a similar offer from Caterpillar when their one-year agreement ends in November. The company said yesterday that it had put the proposals to its clerical and technical staff on January 7 and given them two weeks to consider them. 'Since any decision made by employees will be entirely voluntary, it would be inappropriate for the company to comment on it publicly at this time,' Caterpillar added. Caterpillar said the proposal was part of a strategy to expand employee involvement.</p>

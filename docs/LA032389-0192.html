			<p><P> March 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DISTRICT: MOUNTAIN VIEW SCHOOL DISTRICT;  </P> <P> PAY COMPROMISE SUGGESTED  </P> <P> A state-appointed fact-finder, called in to mediate a contract dispute between  the Mountain View School District and its teachers, has recommended giving the  314 teachers a 4.5% pay increase retroactive to July. The recommendation is not  binding on the school board, which will consider it at an April meeting.  </P> <P> The district, which serves El Monte and South El Monte, has offered a 2.5%  raise if the teachers agree to give up the right to 30 minutes of weekly class  preparation time. The teachers have refused to give up the time and have  demanded an 8.5% increase.  </P> <P> Since school began in September, the dispute has become heated. Teachers' union  representatives have accused Supt. Julian T. Lopez of being tightfisted in  denying their pay request but lavish in spending at least $12,000 to redecorate  his office since he took the post this year. Lopez, a nonsmoker, said the work  was needed because the former superintendent was a heavy smoker.  </P></p>

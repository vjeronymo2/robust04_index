			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / White-collar tendering review COOPERS &amp; LYBRAND, the accountancy firm, has been appointed by the Department of the Environment to study how compulsory competitive tendering can be introduced to local-authority white-collar services. Competitive tendering is already compulsory for a range of manual services, but is yet to be introduced for legal services and 'construction-related services' such as quantity surveying and architecture. Security guards at the Sheffield offices of the Department of Employment are to strike from Monday as part of the NUCPS Civil Service union's dispute over market testing.</p>

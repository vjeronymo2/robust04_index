			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Army defends Balkans job cuts THE ARMY yesterday defended compulsory redundancies served on several officers on duty in former Yugoslavia among 628 being made redundant in its latest round of job cuts. General Sir David Ramsbotham, the adjutant-general who is responsible for Army personnel, said after strong criticism of the move from opposition MPs: 'We honestly could not exclude someone simply because he happened to be serving somewhere on the 25th of February.' Eight officers in Bosnia and Croatia were among those told by commanding officers yesterday that they had to leave the Army. Applications for voluntary redundancy have been accepted from nine others. A further 80 non-commissioned soldiers in former Yugoslavia are also being made redundant. Personnel being made redundant while in former Yugoslavia are being offered extended notice periods because their tours of duty there will not expire until April or May. Normally volunteers have until October to leave the Army. Compulsory redundancies allow for up to 12 months. The new batch of redundancies involves a total of 6,460, including 1,308 officers. Mrs Margaret Beckett, Labour's deputy leader, challenged the government at Commons' questions over the redundancies. 'How would you feel if you were serving in the British Army under fire in Bosnia and were handed a P45?' she asked Mr Tony Newton, the leader of the Commons. Mr Newton, standing in for Mr John Major while he was in the US, said the reduction in numbers had to be handled 'in a fair and even-handed way, and it would be much more unfair to leave troops serving in Bosnia in a state of continuing uncertainty.'</p>

			<p><P> October 11, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CLIPPERS ADD WEIGHT INCENTIVE TO BENJAMIN'S CONTRACT OFFER  </P> <P> The Clippers' latest proposal to holdout center Benoit Benjamin Tuesday  included something of a surprise, although it probably shouldn't have been  under the circumstances: a weight clause.  </P> <P> While offering a one-year deal at the original amount of $1.25 million and  retaining an option for the second, the Clippers added a condition that  Benjamin can receive an undisclosed bonus if he stays under 255 pounds. He will  not be fined for going over, the idea being an incentive to stay trim.  </P> <P> Benjamin said he weighs 275, but is only about 10 pounds too heavy. After a  summer of working out with weights and a personal trainer, he said he can play  at 260 or 265.  </P> <P> Clipper General Counsel Alan Rothenberg had not received a response to the  proposal from Benjamin's agent, Henry Holmes, by Tuesday evening.

			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / International Company News: Campbell's stake in Arnotts 'unlikely to exceed 50%' ARNOTTS, the Australian biscuit company, yesterday claimed that Campbell Soup, the US food group, was unlikely to hold more than 50 per cent of its shares when a hostile takeover bid closes today. Mr Bill Purdy, Arnotts' chairman, said the board had been assured that family shareholders who own 20 per cent of the stock would not accept Campbell's offer price of ADollars 9.50 a share. Mr Purdy said he was convinced that other family shareholders, who own a further 6 per cent of the stock, would also refuse the offer. He said that discussions with financial institutions had been 'encouraging.' Campbell, which owned 33 per cent of Arnotts before the bid, said it received acceptances for 5m shares yesterday, increasing its stake to just under 39 per cent. The higher shareholding entitles Campbell to increase its representation on Arnotts' board from two to three under a 1985 shareholding agreement between the two companies. However, a New South Wales court ruled recently that the agreement required Campbell to acquire more than 85.1 per cent of Arnotts before it could take control of the board. Campbell has said the offer will not be increased, and has dismissed suggestions it will launch a higher offer after the existing bid closes. However, most analysts expect a second offer later this year. The bid, which values Arnotts at ADollars 1.3bn (USDollars 928m), could also be extended. Arnotts shares, which have traded consistently above the offer price, closed 2 cents higher at ADollars 9.52 on the Australian Stock Exchange. MR Michael Nugent, chief executive of Goodman Fielder, the Australasian food group, said there was 'no basis' to market rumours that the group was likely to be the target of a hostile takeover bid. 'It is just idle talk as far as we are concerned. There is no basis for it at all,' Mr Nugent said. He said the group attributed the speculation to increased interest in food stocks.</p>

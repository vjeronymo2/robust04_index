			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Report by Vito Biello: "The Economics of the Second </F> Republic"]    [Text] A platform, be it progressive or leftist, already  exists in a certain sense and will be made known very soon. A  moderate or rightist one has yet to be created. It does not  matter whether it is square, round or rectangular, for now  political groups are watching this "program platform" which  should show the way for the government program in the next  legislature.    The progressive forces that gravitate around the PDS  [Democratic Party of the Left] seem to be going full speed  ahead, strengthened by the successes in the recent  administrative elections. Favored in the polls, propelled by  unprecedented international acceptance, the Alliance is now  facing its ordeal by fire, precisely that of its platform. "The  government's program is going to come out of this," Occhetto is  fond of repeating, "and it will decide who is in and who is  out." The compatibility of the forces ranging from the Greens to  Refoundation is up for discussion.    The economists of the oak tree [the electoral symbol of the  PDS] insist that there is no turning back for the policy of  reform. Occhetto professes moderation, D'Alema is the first to  hint at a return of Ciampi, and insists on a "government of  transition," but for the progressive forces, the proof of the  pudding is around the corner. Among the moderate forces on the  other hand, everything is up in the air. The political groups  are thinking more about agreements and alliances than about  programs.    The DC [Christian Democratic party] is preparing to become  the Italian Popular Party, and the confusion is great; the other  political groups regard one another at times with suspicion, or  alternately offer the hand of friendship. Bossi and Segni,  Berlusconi's (eventual) political party and the Popular Party  exchange messages while waiting to make a decision. But on this  front as well, the coming weeks will be decisive.    Therefore, it is time for some answers, beginning with those  to the 10 questions posed by the Confindustria [General  Confederation of Italian Industry].    MONDO ECONOMICO listened to the views of Michele Salvati,  leading economist of the PDS and author of its economic program;  Maria Segni, leader of the Popularists; and Roberto Maroni, head  of the group of League deputies in the Chamber.</p>

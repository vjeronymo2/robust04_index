			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / International Company News: Bristol-Myers says lawsuits without merit BRISTOL-MYERS Squibb, the US pharmaceuticals company, said there was 'no basis for the allegations' in the lawsuits filed against the company, Reuters reports. The company was responding to earlier published reports that shareholders had filed at least five lawsuits alleging executives did not publicly release important information. On June 2 Bristol-Myers' stock dropped sharply after it said 1992 earnings would be below earlier analysts' estimates because of wholesaler inventory problems.</p>

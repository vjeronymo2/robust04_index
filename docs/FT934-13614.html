			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Philippines sell-off continues THE Philippines government is determined to pursue privatisation plans for Petron Corporation, the state-owned market leader in the petroleum refining and marketing business, despite opposition from a number of Congress members. Philippine National Oil Company (PNOC), the state-owned energy group, has issued invitations for tenders for 40 per cent of Petron, which is among the most attractive assets the government has lined up for privatisation. British Petroleum, Aramco of Saudi Arabia and Petronas have all shown an interest. Plans for privatisation date back to 1986 but little progress has been made on most of the main items, although last year the auction of 67 per cent of Philippine Airlines was successful. Mr Romeo Bernardo, finance under-secretary, said this week that the deadline for Petron bids has been set for December 15. The hurdle price for the bidders will be determined and announced only on the day the bids are to be opened. PNOC is looking for a 'strategic partner' which, officials say, must be capable of putting in 'added value' in Petron in the form of technical expertise and access to petroleum supply. Petron controls 40 per cent of the Philippine market for petroleum products, with sales reaching Pesos 40.7bn (Pounds 974m) last year, which made it the country's biggest corporation in terms of sales. But Petron's profits last year of nearly Pesos 1.47bn and total assets of some Pesos 15bn has led to strong criticism by some members of Congress who feel the government must maintain its control of such a strategic industry. PNOC has explained it would maintain holdings at 40 per cent, after a planned 20 per cent public offering in early 1994. This, PNOC officials said, should be enough to provide government with an influencing presence in the industry. Investors who qualify for the bidding will be required to submit technical and financial proposals. They are also expected to commit themselves to a long-term arrangement with the Philippine government on Petron. Petron is one of several assets the government wants to privatise within the next six months, an exercise expected to generate some Pesos 18bn. The others include: Manila Hotel, National Steel and Philippine Shipyard and Engineering Corporation (Philseco). Plans are to sell off 30 per cent of Manila Hotel and 65 per cent of National Steel.</p>

			<p><P> May 27, 1990, Sunday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> PROFILE JOHN GILLESPIE;  </P> <P> SHERIFF UNOPPOSED, EVEN BY DETRACTORS  </P> <P> Ventura County Sheriff John Gillespie has a toy gallows on his desk labeled  "Executive Problem Solver." The black-humor touch provides a clue to both his  personality and his crime-fighting philosophy.  </P> <P> One moment, Gillespie cracks a smile, remembering himself as a young Claremont  policeman assigned as a bodyguard to Jane Fonda during her frequent visits to  Tom Hayden at anti-war demonstrations in the Claremont area.  </P> <P> "I think I was there when love was born," he said.  </P> <P> Then Gillespie's face clouds over. He declares his fierce belief in the death  penalty, booming, "For some crimes, the only thing fitting . . . is to dispose  of that piece of garbage and do it as soon as you can."  </P> <P> Gillespie, 50, is running unopposed for reelection June 5, entering what would  be his seventh year as sheriff.  </P> <P> Gillespie's colleagues say he is a mix of old values and new projects, a  skilled administrator whose personal experience helped him to understand police  work from the bottom up.  </P> <P> Even his detractors express respect for him.  </P> <P> John Hatcher, the president of the Ventura County chapter of the National Assn.  for the Advancement of Colored People, has criticized Gillespie's  administration over allegations of rough treatment of prisoners by guards at  the County Jail. But Hatcher said Gillespie's office always answers those  complaints quickly.  </P> <P> Hatcher said, "Maybe sometimes in a position of being at the top, you don't  always know what's going on beneath you."  </P> <P> Ventura County Public Defender Kenneth Clayman has criticized Gillespie's plan  to house drug users in a "tent city" as "a very expensive undertaking." Clayman  has heard a few complaints about deputies using excessive force during arrests  but said the Sheriff's Department never whitewashes such cases.  </P> <P> Clayman called Gillespie a "prototype" lawman -- "He's very, very tough but  very progressive."  </P> <P> "He's clearly a 21st-Century law enforcement person," said county Chief  Administrative Officer Richard Wittenberg. "He's a very strong believer in  education. Nine or 10 of his top 12 people have master's degrees. . . . He  understands there are other things outside of law enforcement."  </P> <P> But John Gillespie might never have become a cop if he hadn't been so bored  with school.  </P> <P> In 1957, he ignored a drama scholarship to the University of Wyoming and a  baseball scholarship to Pepperdine University and instead joined the Marines.  </P> <P> After serving in coastal stations in California, he emerged three years later,  married Carol, now his wife of 30 years, and began their family of four sons.  </P> <P> Then he went to work in Hollywood as a public relations man for Western Union.  </P> <P> One day, the company sent the 21-year-old Gillespie to collect a facsimile  machine from a famous director who had not used it in three years.  </P> <P> "I had the personal honor of being thrown out of Sam Goldwyn Studios by Sam  Goldwyn himself -- I mean, physically thrown out -- and he was a pretty old man  at the time," Gillespie said.  </P> <P> "He called me something like a whippersnapper and then something obscene, and  he grabbed me by the back and picked me up and threw me out."  </P> <P> Gillespie also worked at Capitol Records, shipping the latest singles out to  disc jockeys with telegraphed press releases -- his idea.  </P> <P> But that idea's novelty wore thin after a while, and so did the entertainment  business, Gillespie said.  </P> <P> "The caricature of the Hollywood agent with his feet on the table, 'I'll take  care of ya, baby' -- it was a world of absolute phoniness, and I hated it."  </P> <P> Looking for more worthwhile work, he passed the Civil Service exam and joined  the Claremont Police Department as a desk officer and dispatcher.  </P> <P> The early years were grueling. Gillespie worked 48-hour weeks on the graveyard  shift, while moonlighting at Sears loading trucks and taking day classes for  his bachelor's degree at Cal Poly Pomona.  </P> <P> The late '60s also was a chaotic time to be a policeman in Claremont, a city of  seven colleges.  </P> <P> Gillespie recalls a night when the 35-man police force was sent out to maintain  order during an anti-war protest by 5,000 students who marched 10 abreast down  Claremont's main street. "We had no training in these things and we were  scared," he said. "Hell, we were no older than the students at the time."  </P> <P> He eventually was promoted to lieutenant, served briefly as acting chief and  decided he liked being in charge.  </P> <P> After nine years, Gillespie moved to Ojai to take the vacant position of police  chief and get his children out of Claremont, which he calls "the smoggiest  place in the world."  </P> <P> He stayed two years in Ojai, "a great little town, a little arty," but "one of  those strange places that doesn't change."  </P> <P> Then in 1974, Port Hueneme Police Chief Al Jalaty, a former sheriff's  lieutenant, decided to run for Ventura County sheriff.  </P> <P> "John had just come into Ojai," Jalaty said. "So I wanted to help him, new man  in town. I went up and talked to him a few times and I thought he was a pretty  sharp person. And the longer I talked to him, the more I thought of him."  </P> <P> Jalaty was elected and took Gillespie on as undersheriff. Together, they ran  the Sheriff's Department for a decade.  </P> <P> The earliest years of their administration were rough, the two say.  </P> <P> The County Jail, which had been bought secondhand from Texas and reassembled  behind the San Buenaventura City Hall, was a constant source of complaints from  officers and inmates -- a cramped, overcrowded hole with poor ventilation.  </P> <P> And the previous administration of Sheriff Bill Hill had left the department  with a $1-million deficit.  </P> <P> After a year of reorganization and cutting positions, the department was still  "$600,000 in the hole," Gillespie said.  </P> <P> The new jail took four years to plan and build, including numerous 5 a.m.  meetings with the architects to iron out details.  </P> <P> But other changes came more quickly.  </P> <P> Jalaty and Gillespie began the Community-Oriented Police Enforcement program.  COPE put sheriff's deputies in field offices in every Ventura County town,  enabling the department to book suspects all over the county instead of only at  the County Jail.  </P> <P> "You'd spend half the day just running back and forth to the sheriff's office,"  Jalaty said. "We cut the time in half."  </P> <P> Gillespie also reorganized the department brass in 1976, cutting the positions  of four chief deputies and eight captains, replacing them with five commanders  and saving the county $300,000 a year. In 1980, he merged the sheriff's and  marshal's departments, saving another $800,000 a year.  </P> <P> While Gillespie ran the department's day-to-day operations, keeping his hand in  the streets on major drug busts and murder cases, Jalaty made the executive  command decisions -- and the public appearances required of the sheriff.  </P> <P> "Al Jalaty was Mr. Outside and I was Mr. Inside," Gillespie said.  </P> <P> When Jalaty retired in 1984 because of poor health, the Board of Supervisors  appointed Gillespie to replace him -- on April 1, "which was a very appropriate  day," he said. Gillespie was subsequently elected sheriff in 1986.  </P> <P> "He's a good administrator, but he's got grease on his hands, you know what I  mean?" Undersheriff Larry Carpenter said. "And in that sense he's a good  adviser. You can actually sit down with him with a problem. He's innovative  too, which surprises a lot of people."  </P> <P> Gillespie hired a staff psychiatrist to help cut down on stress-related  absences.  </P> <P> He started a canine unit in 1986 to track suspects and missing persons and to  provide special event security and riot control.  </P> <P> He oversaw formation of the sheriff's search-and-rescue team, complete with a  mounted division for high-country searches, and trained helicopter crews  staffed with doctors.  </P> <P> Then there is Rose Valley Work Camp, which Carpenter calls "The jewel in the  crown." The year-old military-style camp functions as a minimum-security jail  and vocational training school and has drawn good reviews from its own inmates.  </P> <P> "He brought some sophistication to a small department and a lot of new and  innovative ideas," Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury said. "It's probably one of  the few departments in the state that has expertise in major frauds and  white-collar crime," which Bradbury said other departments "kiss off" by  "telling the victim that this is a civil matter."  </P> <P> Gillespie applies the same tough approach to his own employees.  </P> <P> "If I have a philosophy, it is this: We are in the honesty business here, and  if you violate any ethics or any honesty, I'll not only fire you, but I'll see  that you're prosecuted," he said.  </P> <P> In his spare time, Gillespie works with charities and community groups,  including United Way, the American Cancer Society and the Boy Scouts. He is a  voracious moviegoer and trivia buff and takes long camping trips with his wife  in their motor home, traveling from state beach to state beach.  </P> <P> "I'm dabbling in writing," he said. "That's what I intend to do when I retire,  write the great American novel. I even have a working title. I'm thinking of  calling it 'The Funny Side of the Badge.' "  </P></p>

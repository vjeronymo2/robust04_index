			<p>BFN     [Text] Kuala Lumpur, April 28 (OANA/BERNAMA) -- Malaysia  has once again voiced its concern over the increasing tendency  on the part of certain influential members of the United Nations  Security Council to be selective in [word indistinct] questions  of international peace and security. Malaysia's permanent  representative to the UN, Razali Ismail, said this was clearly  demonstrated by the council's reluctance to enforce its own  resolutions to the situation in Bosnia. Razali said: The  procrastination and half-hearted approach to end Serbia's  blatant aggression and practice of ethnic-cleansing in  Bosnia-Herzegovina is a clear example of the council's  selectivity and double standards.    In fact, the council appeared to be locked in a political  paralysis with some influential members weighing the political,  financial and manpower costs to get involved in the crisis, he  said when addressing the opening of the [word indistinct]  working group on the question of equitable representation on and  increase in the membership of the security council in New York,  Wednesday.    The text of his speech was faxed to BERNAMA on [word  indistinct] Thursday.    Razali said: Worse still, the council continues to deny the  inherent right of the victims of aggression and the government  of Bosnia and Herzegovina for collective or individual  self-defence under Article 51 of the charter.    Razali said the council must use the special power given it  to display impartiality and drop its double standards and not be  dictated by its domestic constituents alone.    A close and careful examination of the security council's  record clearly revealed that its achievements remain far from  satisfactory. There are too many crisis and trouble spots in the  world that demand the council's attention, he said.</p>

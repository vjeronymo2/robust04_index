The Republicans may be particularly tempted by that,  because Richard Nixon fell over the cover-up of the break-in  into the Democrats' headquarters two decades ago. The fact that  now a Democratic President is displaying extreme clumsiness as  he tries to get through the investigations against him is just  what his opponents want.    The comparison is lacking in one respect: The Watergate  break-in took place, and Nixon was not proved to have  participated in it but to have lied. Whether the Clintons'  Whitewater deal is to be challenged in the first place is still  open, and the Clintons have not yet been proved to be lying.  Compared with Watergate, the Whitewater affair will probably  remain only a little brook.    Nevertheless: Richard Nixon did not fall because the  Republicans wanted to hurt their enemy but because the president  led the investigators by the nose and hurt the people -- in  their trust. The Clintons have come that far already: Holding  back incriminating files about the affair and ordering the  investigators to report constantly on their findings, this gives  the affair -- if there is not more hidden behind it -- a bad  taste.    There is one thing that Whitewater has shown as a basic  tenet: The team around the President is as weak as its boss.  Very close associates and advisers are chosen either by Bill  Clinton as a result of friendship or by the First Lady. The  fact that Clinton's only emerging (and still disputed) success  -- the health reform -- has been accomplished by her is as  characteristic as the fact that it is her role in the Whitewater  case that is the incriminating one and not his. In addition,  there are no real strategists in the White House, who could  provide a bit of direction to the President's presentation.  Clinton prefers to do all that himself by eagerly praising his  wife (since she also defended him when he was accused of  womanizing).    This shows that there is indeed a difference between  Watergate and Whitewater: Even in a mess Nixon still had style.</p>

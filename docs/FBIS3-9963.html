One year after the military court  sentenced 25 Army officers to prison for an alleged coup d'etat  attempt, leaders of the 13 November Civic Movement said this was  an unconstitutional ruling, therefore it is invalid.    General Luis Pastor Vives, president of the organizing  committee, called for the release of his comrades in arms,  arguing that the government's uncompromising position had  priority even though favorable circumstances exist, like the  promulgation of the new Constitution. A message from Gen.  Salinas Sedo was transmitted during a news conference in which  he expressed his disagreement with his sentence although he  emphasized he preferred prison to an undignified freedom.  Meanwhile, his attorney indicated that Congress should pass an  amnesty law for the prisoners.</p>

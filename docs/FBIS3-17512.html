Speaking at a government meeting in the village of Metsamor  where the station is located, the president expressed the  opinion that the reopening of the station would enable Armenia  to gain minimal energy independence and to avoid considerable  losses from a transportation and energy blockade.    Ter-Petrosyan said that "a serious inspection at the  international level" is to be carried out at the nuclear station  in the near future. He said that this year the financing of  work on the station was included in the state budget. At the  same time, he "expects foreign aid."    In this connection, Ter-Petrosyan pointed to the particular  significance of the Armenian-Russian agreement on the nuclear  station signed in Moscow last week. "I am sure that its  implementation will speed up the reopening of the station," he  pointed out.    Armenian experts believe that the station can be launched  into operation in a year and a half, costing about 70 million  dollars.    The Armenian station was shut down due to public demand  after  the December 1988 earthquake in Armenia, although it was not  damaged at that time.    The Armenian government confirmed the station's status as a  special facility.    The government managed to find money to pay wages to the  personnel of the station according to a special tariff network.  From April 1 the average wages at the station will be 2,200  drums or 20 minimal wages in Armenia. In addition, workers will  receive 50 drums for nutrition on a daily basis. It was also  decided to rename the station from Armenian into Metsamor.</p>

			<p><P> May 26, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SCHWARTZ, LUCERO FEUD AT SPEEDWAY RACE  </P> <P> The feud between Bobby Schwartz of Costa Mesa and Steve Lucero of Riverside  erupted Friday when Lucero crashed into Schwartz on the second lap of the  scratch main event at the speedway motorcycle racing program at the Orange  County Fairgrounds.  </P> <P> Schwartz, the defending U.S. champion, was leading the race when Lucero rammed  into the rear of Schwartz's bike and knocked him off it.  </P> <P> It was the third time in five weeks the riders have had problems on the track.  </P> <P> The race was called complete on from that point and Lucero was declared the  winner. Scott Brant of Riverside was second, Dukie Ermolenko of Cypress third  and Schwartz, who didn't continue, finished fourth.  </P> <P> Afterward, Schwartz, 33, confronted promoter Harry Oxley in the track office  and the pair shoved each other, according to a witness.  </P> <P> "Bobby is a clean rider," Harry Oxley said afterwards. "And it seems Steve is  out to get him. I don't blame Bobby for being mad and he exploded in the  office."  </P> <P> Oxley also said the on-track incident would be reviewed further.

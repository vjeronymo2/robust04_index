			<p><P> January 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'TEACHERS TAKE EXTRA DUTIES'  </P> <P> I read with interest Rich Connell's article on teachers' salaries.  </P> <P> I noticed almost no women and no elementary teachers were mentioned as earning  large salaries. The opportunity to earn extra income is significantly less in  elementary schools. Few elementary teachers can teach inter-session or summer  school as we do in secondary schools.  </P> <P> I would suspect that the majority of women teachers have family obligations  that would make most of these extra paid assignments impossible. Considering  the fact that 71% of LAUSD teachers are women, this system takes on an element  of sexist discrimination. It appears that the few extra assignments that are  available are mainly for male secondary teachers.  </P> <P> This article is misleading by giving the impression that any teacher who is, as  school Board President Roberta Weintraub says, "really entrepreneurial" can  earn $60,000 to $70,000 per year. It makes those of us who don't, look like a  bunch of unmotivated goof-offs. The truth is that few teachers have the  opportunity to get the additional paid assignments. Many more, including  myself, don't have the time or energy for extra paid assignments after  preparing for, teaching and evaluating five classes of 38 or 39 students per  day. Additionally, teachers are then required to attend a couple of faculty  meetings per week, open house and back to school night; compute and write  progressive reports and report cards; call parents, and supervise students.  This all adds up to more than a full-time job.  </P> <P> The fact that only .007% of the teachers in LAUSD earn $70,000 or more is  evidence that the opportunity to earn that amount is very small. Do you really  think that so few teachers would opt to earn $70,000 per year if the  opportunity was really there?  </P> <P> Teachers should not be expected to work night, day and weekends to earn a  living wage in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> WAYNE JOHNSON  </P> <P> President  </P> <P> United Teachers-Los Angeles  </P></p>

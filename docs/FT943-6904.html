			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / West Coast rail plan to cost Pounds 500m Modernisation plans for the 550-mile West Coast main railway are unlikely to lead to construction of a high-speed line on the French model because of the cost and the likelihood of environmental protests. But Mr Gil Howarth, Railtrack's director of major projects, said yesterday that the introduction of '21st-century signalling' with modest changes to the present route should still lead to significant reductions in journey times. The Pounds 500m upgrading of the West Coast route, last modernised in the 1970s, is expected to reduce the London to Glasgow journey from six to four hours, London to Manchester or Liverpool from 2 3/4 to two hours, and London to Birmingham from two to 1 1/4 hours. These times should prove competitive with airline schedules. The West Coast line is one of the busiest in the UK, carrying more than 2,000 trains a day. InterCity expresses account for 16 per cent of train journeys although they cover 80 per cent of the mileage travelled. The likely design of the line has emerged from a 'second sift' of options carried out by a 60-strong project team consisting of staff of Railtrack and WCML Development, a private-sector consortium involved in the feasibility study. A third review will take place in October in time for final proposals to be put to the government before Christmas. A construction consortium will be selected by competitive tender to start work next year. Depending on the degree of disruption acceptable to existing services, modernisation will take between four and eight years. Local authorities and business interests along the line have been pressing for it to be upgraded to speeds of 125mph to 185mph. It appears top speeds will be at the lower end of this range, but improved journey times can still be gained by track realignment and modifications to narrow tunnels. Significant improvements will result from the upgrading of signalling. The latest airline-style radio-operated system, which does away with track-side signals, could be used on the fastest sections of track. A more conventional system would operate around big cities. Mr Howarth said it would be possible for InterCity services to be controlled over the entire route by a single signalling centre but two or three centres were more likely. This is likely to lead to a reduction in the number of signalling staff. A decision has yet to be taken on whether new rolling stock will be provided for the line - at a further likely cost of Pounds 300m to Pounds 400m - although the more modern the track and signalling systems, the more likely it becomes that new trains will be needed. One option being considered is tilting trains similar to those in Sweden and Spain. The private sector is expected to contribute most of the cost of the project  -in return for a concession to operate the line - although public funds will also be needed. Present government thinking is for the line to be financed through a subsidy for the train operators' track-access charges rather than by a grant to meet capital costs. The consortium which wins the contract will probably be expected to take responsibility for maintaining the track.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Professor Nikos Mouzelis, London School of </F> Economics: "Eight Truths Which We Do Not Want to Hear"]    [Text] Because misinformation and the systematic  disorientation of the citizenry on the Skopje issue have taken  on kafkaesque proportions, I will attempt, in this brief note,  not to develop, but simply to mention a small number of points  that all of us should know in order to formulate a logical and  nationally advantageous position vis-a-vis this smoldering  problem, a problem which day by day becomes even more  unsolvable, thereby worsening our country's position vis-a-vis  friends and foes.    1. After the Balkan Wars and the First World War, the  geographic region of Macedonia was divided into three parts.  Greece received 53 percent, Serbia received 33 percent, and  Bulgaria--as the loser in the wars--received the smallest part.    2. As early as 1919 the two areas not joined to Greece were  called Yugoslav Macedonia (or Vardar Macedonia) and Bulgarian  Macedonia (or Pirin Macedonia) by foreign and Greek politicians,  diplomats, historians, geographers, and journalists. For  example, look in theIliou Encyclopediaunder  "Macedonian Question."    3. In 1924, after the Asia Minor disaster and the massive  population exchanges, our part of Macedonia became "Greek" not  just due to the division, but also ethnographically: that is,  the Slavonic minorities in Greek Macedonia became from that  time, and continue to be today, insignificant. Therefore, after  1924 no serious minorities issue arises in Greek Macedonia, as  it does in Thrace.    4. After the Second World War, the area joined to Serbia in  1919 became, under the name Macedonia, one of the "republics" of  Socialist Yugoslavia, which was tolerated by Greece. Since then,  up to today, the inhabitants of that area have, in the main,  been raised with the notion that they are Macedonians.    5. The issue of not accepting Skopje, not just under the  name  of "Republic of Macedonia," but also under a "hybrid" name (e.g.  Vardar Macedonia), began with Mr. Samaras, who managed to set  the basic rules of the game (that is, making the name absolutely  paramount), rules which the two large parties decided to follow.    6. Greece's insistence on not recognizing Skopje, not just  under the name of "Republic of Macedonia" (something that is  logical), but also under a "hybrid" name (something illogical),  is at variance with basic democratic rules concerning the right  to self-determination for individuals, groups, and peoples, as  these rules have been formulated, for example, by the United  Nations.    7. Even if we were to find friends and allies who would be  disposed to "pressure" Mr. Gligorov into accepting our  maximalist position (that is, forbidding the use of the term  "Macedonia and its derivatives"), the latter could never impose  such a solution on the Skopje Parliament. The parliament would  by an overwhelming majority vote down every name not having some  reference to the term "Macedonia."    8. When we maintain at demonstrations and elsewhere that  "Macedonia is Greek," or, even worse, that it is "one and  Greek," every rational human being could only give two  interpretations to the aforementioned slogans: either we are  ignoring what occurred in 1919, or we do not accept the  division, and therefore have plans to annex the two areas of  Macedonia that are at this time outside Greek borders.  Therefore, when our political and religious leaders not only  tolerate, but also passionately promote these slogans, it is not  at all strange that foreigners think that we have lost our  reason, or that we have imperialist tendencies vis-a-vis two  other non-Greek Macedonias.    The aforementioned eight informational observations cannot  be  ignored by arguing that Skopje has taken leave of its senses,  and that its chauvinism and irredentism has taken on paranoid or  ludicrous proportions, etc. Although Skopje is truely talking  absurdities, that is no reason for us to talk absurdities as  well in supporting positions unbecoming to a country with our  cultural heritage, a country that is a member of the European  Union [EU] and has behind it two centuries of democratic  parliamentary tradition. Above all there is no excuse for hiding  from the Greek people basic information such as that which I  have just mentioned. Systematic misinformation underestimates  the intelligence of the Greek people, and is based on an  extremely antidemocratic, obscurantist, autarchic mentality.  Above all, it impedes us in correctly evaluating the current  situation.    Specifically, at this time there are two basic strategies  that we can follow:    Strategy A: Insisting on making absolutely paramount, or  monolpolizing, the term "Macedonia."    This strategy can only result in the following: the  continuation of the diplomatic isolation of our country;  everyone recognizing Skopje under the truely irredentist name of  "Republic of Macedonia;" the worldwide projection of the image  of [President] Gligorov, and the support of all governments for  Skopje as "victim" of Greek intransigence; the "embracing" of  Skopje on the part of Bulgaria and Turkey; the dramatic rise of  Turkish influence in the Balkans and western Europe; and,  finally, the loss of a unique opportunity for our country to  become the unifying link between the EU and the Balkans.    Strategy B: the acceptance of a "hybrid name."    The clear acceptance on the part of Greece that a name  containing the term "Macedonia" constitutes a negotiable matter  will immediately open the way for a "Pinheiro" type of solution.  That is, Greece will on the one hand accept a hybrid name (e.g.,  Vardar Macedonia) and offer economic cooperation in return for  the three well-known conditions (changes in the Constitution, a  change of symbols, and an end to irredentist propaganda). In  addition, Greece could request and easily attain special  security provisions for her current borders.    If the aforementioned points are right, one must wonder how  it is possible for the government and the larger part of the  opposition to insist on self-destructive Strategy A. Perhaps our  politicians have gone mad? No, they have not gone mad; they are  simply putting party interest, the much-vaunted calculation of  "political cost," above every other calculation. Populist  flagwaving would seem to triumph yet again. The Skopje question  is the most blatant sign of a deep political and social crisis  through which our country is now passing.</p>

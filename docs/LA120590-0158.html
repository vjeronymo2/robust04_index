			<p><P> December 5, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> AGASSI MAY YET FACE PENALTY  </P> <P> re Agassi still faces sanctions from the International Tennis Federation for  pulling out of the Grand Slam Cup, an ITF official said today.  </P> <P> Agassi originally signed to play in next week's $6-million tournament in  Munich, then pulled out.  </P> <P> Last week he reluctantly agreed to play again, fearing he would be barred from  one or more of the grand slam competitions next year and might face a lawsuit.  </P> <P> Then he withdrew again Tuesday because of injury.  </P> <P> ITF official Bill Babcock told Reuters the federation had received Agassi's  medical report and would now ask first reserve Brad Gilbert of the United  States to take his place in the elite 16-player tournament.  </P> <P> But he said the ITF had not dropped discussions on what penalties to impose on  Agassi for his earlier conduct.  </P> <P> "No decision will be made now until after the Grand Slam Cup," Babcock added.  </P> <P> Agassi, runner-up in the U.S. Open and French Open this year, has torn  cartilage in his chest, suffered during last weekend's Davis Cup victory over  Australia. He will be out of action for three to six weeks.  </P></p>

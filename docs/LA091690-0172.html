			<p><P> September 16, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PREP FOOTBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> MISSION VIEJO FALLS A HALF SHORT, 45-24  </P> <P> Two halves of football. That's what it takes, and that's what Rancho Buena  Vista got Saturday night. And that was bad news for Mission Viejo.  </P> <P> In a game matching the fourth-ranked team from Orange County against the No. 3  team from San Diego, host RBV scored a 45-24 victory in front of 2,500 at Vista  High School.  </P> <P> Mission Viejo held a 24-21 halftime lead on the strength of two touchdown  passes by Tom Snowden, but that would be it for the Diablos' offense. Mission  Viejo was stung by second-half turnovers.  </P> <P> The Longhorns tied the score at 24-24 on a 25-yard field goal to open the third  quarter. Mission Viejo was driving for its fourth touchdown when a fumble  occurred between Snowden and center Brian Hodson. It was the first of four  turnovers for the Diablos.  </P> <P> RBV turned the miscue into a 31-24 lead after Edric Hall rushed for 68 yards  and Tyrone Cormier scored from five yards out.  </P> <P> "I think that the fumbled exchange really took the wind out of our sails,"  Mission Viejo Coach Mike Rush said. "And our defense didn't keep them out of  the end zone."  </P> <P> Mission Viejo's next three drives ended in interceptions.  </P> <P> After the first interception, Tyrone Cormier scored from 13 yards to make it  38-24.  </P> <P> Snowden, who completed 17 of 23 passes for 201 yards in the first half,  finished 26 of 38 for 294.  </P> <P> RBV gained 523 yards on the ground, victimizing the Diablos with big plays all  night. The Longhorns had rushes of 67 and 40 yards in the first half and 32, 68  and 53 yards in the second. MARTIN HENDERSON  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>Armenian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Armenian Defense Ministry press service reported  that a relative calm prevailed on the Republic's borders since  last night.    However, the same source reported that Azerbaijani Air Force  planes again violated Armenia's airspace during the daytime  yesterday. Two bombers appeared over the borders of  Vardenisskiy Rayon at noon and then flew south at a considerable  height over Kelbadzharskiy Rayon. One of them violated  Armenia's airspace in Gorisskiy Rayon at around 1500 and dropped  three cluster bombs in the border zone. The other flew toward  Nagorno-Karabakh Republic [NKR].    Four Azerbaijani aircraft carried out reconnaissance flights  over the border regions of Gorisskiy Rayon at 1700 on the same  day. They immediately left the region when faced with measures  taken by the Armenian air-defense forces.    Though a relative calm is being maintained along most of the  war front in Karabakh, Azerbaijani troops are still attacking  the Karabakh positions in certain sectors.    NKR Defense Army press service reported that following an  artillery barrage this morning, the enemy resumed the offensive  against the southeastern sector. According to information  received at noon, the Karabakh army formations were managing to  halt the Azerbaijani attacks.    Only positional exchange of fire is taking place in the rest  of the conflict zone.</p>

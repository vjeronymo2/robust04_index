			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / Leading Article: Making peace in southern Africa THERE is a thread of mutual self-interest that links the complex developments under way in southern Africa. The current Angolan peace initiative is as critical to the welfare of the region as efforts to curb political violence in South Africa. If President FW de Klerk, Mr Nelson Mandela and Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi fail to end the bloodshed the implications for South Africa are bad enough. It would also mean disaster for its neighbours, for whom trade ties with Pretoria are vital. At the same time, successful negotiations to end civil wars in Angola and Mozambique will count for little if the region's military and industrial giant is in its death throes. And if those negotiations should fail, South Africa will be among the losers. President de Klerk's vision of post-apartheid South Africa emerging from recession, acting as a regional magnet for foreign investors, is dependent on stability in southern Africa as a whole. There are two ways in which the outside world can contribute to this symbiotic peace process. South Africa can be assisted by the lifting of all sanctions (except the arms embargo) and the restoration of sporting contacts. Continuing economic decline can only fuel political tensions. But at this stage at least, there is little further part for outsiders to play: the country has the capacity, whether in the form of political leaders or infrastructure, to preside over its transition to democracy. Elusive peace The same thing, however, cannot be said of the two other countries critical to southern Africa's stability. Mozambique's peace process is in jeopardy. The Renamo rebel movement is motivated by banditry as much as ideology; the government, which has agreed to a multi-party system and is ending state control of the economy, has nowhere else to turn. And three decades of war have devastated the economy and communications. The need for outside help was acknowledged by government and rebels alike when they accepted multinational monitoring of a partial ceasefire. But it is increasingly clear that without further substantial international involvement, peace in Mozambique will remain elusive. Angola, with much greater economic potential, offers more hope. The rival leaders, President Eduardo dos Santos, leader of the MPLA party, and Mr Jonas Savimbi, head of the Unita guerrilla movement, are in control of their respective organisations. The settlement terms outlined this week by Mr Savimbi suggest that both men have given ground in talks to end a 14-year war that has cost hundreds of thousands of lives. Outside involvement But the level of outside involvement needed if the settlement is to succeed is substantial, and it is not yet clear whether the United States, the Soviet Union and the United Nations are prepared to provide the personnel and resources for monitoring the cease-fire and multi-party elections on the scale required. No estimate appears to have been made. But one only has to recall that UN monitoring of the Namibian settlement required a 7,500 strong force and cost several hundred million dollars to realise that it will be expensive. Namibia's population is a little more than a million, and its infrastructure was intact. Angola has 10m people, and its infrastructure has been largely destroyed. Any call for assistance nevertheless deserves a generous response from the international community, above all from the superpowers. The long term solution to Africa's horrific famine requires an end to its wars. Conflict in the Horn may seem intractable. But in southern Africa at least, Mozambique and Angola have a framework for peace. It was, after all, superpower rapprochement which helped undo southern Africa's political logjam, bringing about Namibia's independence and ending Pretoria's military support for Unita in return for Cuban troops leaving Angola. The superpowers, backed by the broader international community, have an important role to play.</p>

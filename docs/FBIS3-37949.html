			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] We had a telephone conversation today with Irakli  Machavariani, a member of the Georgian delegation at the Geneva  talks on settling the Abkhazian conflict. He reported that the  Abkhazian party had put forward a concept of Abkhazia's legal  statute that is absolutely unacceptable for Georgia. It  stipulates "not even a confederative restructuring within the  frame of an integral Georgia but rather a form of a treaty much  more resembling relations between two neighbor states, in  addition, rather cool."    Machavariani particularly pointed out that the Abkhazian  party behaves as a "victor" in the light of recent events in  Gali Rayon and this causes extreme aggravation in the atmosphere  of the talks.    However, said Machavariani, representatives of the world  community and Russia at the talks keep backing an idea of  Georgia's territorial integrity and in this respect their  position is quite close to that of Georgia. This permits us to  pin hopes on reaching a certain consensus while handling the  problem.    According to Machavariani, a concluding sitting will be held  tomorrow, when the work carried out at the talks will be summed  up.</p>

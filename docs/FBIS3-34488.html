			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by On Levi] </F>   [Text] The testing phase of antimissile missile Barak have  been completed, and the Israeli Navy will procure its first  Barak system in the coming months.    "Baraqi completed a three-part series of tests at the end of  last year, and all three tests were successful." This was  revealed yesterday by a senior Israeli Navy figure. He added  that the Navy plans to install this missile system on the Saar 5  missile boats which are being built in the United States, and on  some of the Saar 4.5 vessels.    The Barak missile is the result of a joint REFA'EL [Armament  Development Authority] and IAI [Israel Aircraft Industries]  development. The missile's range is about 10 km, and it can hit  a pinpointed target. The missile will be mounted on Saar 5 and  Saar 4.5 as the central defense weapon system. The senior  figure said that Barak is the best missile of its kind in the  world, and its uniqueness lies in its ability to intercept  low-flying missiles cruising a few meters above water. The  missile can be also used against attacking aircraft.    In the last three tests, the missile was fired from a naval  platform, and it intercepted a Gabriel ship-to-ship missile. In  one of the tests, Barak hit Gabriel as it had been programmed,  while in the other two tests, it passed a short distance from it  -- also in accordance with the programming which sought to  collect data about the missile's performance.</p>

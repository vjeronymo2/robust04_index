			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / The FT500 (19): No easy ride for Britain's top companies - Attention has focused on banks, property shares and electricity suppliers. Among the large losers have been the growth stocks of yore / Country Analyses - United Kingdom Britain's top companies might have felt entitled to an easier ride in 1993 after the traumas of the election and the enforced departure from the ERM in 1992. In the event, the recovery has been patchy and many companies have found it hard to push up their margins. The biggest surprise has been the failure of inflation to take off after the devaluation. Only gradually has the City come to accept that it may remain muted for some time to come. The stock market, meanwhile, has been travelling hopefully, discounting large earnings recoveries and justifying higher price/earnings multiples on the grounds that lower inflation would improve the quality of earnings. But at least part of the excitement in the equity and the gilts market has been generated by a flow of funds out of low-yielding building society and bank deposits. Flows into unit trusts have been running at record levels. The concern among investors is twofold. First, they are worried about the extent of the recovery, and, second, they are anxious to preserve a running return at a time of falling interest rates. Attention has focused on interest sensitive stocks such as banks whose ability to pay higher dividends has increased just as provisions have started to fall. Property shares, too, have been in demand, as have electricity stocks which offer both yield and the prospect of dividend increases. Movements of UK companies within the European top 500 reflect these factors. Among the large losers have been the growth companies of yore which thrived during the recession, such as supermarkets and pharmaceutical companies. J. Sainsbury may have managed a 17 per cent increase in profit and a 23 per cent return on capital but it has still slipped to 39 from 26th place in the rankings. Kwik Save, with a return on capital of 44 per cent, slipped even further to 352 from 266, though the new-look Asda managed to buck the rankings trend. The proximate reason for the supermarkets' bad performance is pressure on margins as more and more money is invested in new stores and competition increases from the discount outlets. The worry in pharmaceuticals has been related to US healthcare reform and the more general fear that pressure on medical costs around the world will reduce the profitability of patented prescription drugs. Glaxo thus slipped from second to seventh place, while Wellcome moved to 59 from 29. Also hit by a shift in sentiment have been the drinks companies. In the case of Bass - down to 93rd place from 57 - the worry has been the pressures on the brewers as a result of excess capacity and parallel imports from France at a time of shrinking demand. Guinness has suffered from the reluctance of whisky drinkers to trade up in the less flamboyant 1990s. Though its faith in the value of brands remains undiminished, impatience among investors at repeated downgrades of profits expectations has taken its toll. Guinness fell to 29th place from 15. By contrast, it has been a much more satisfying year for the banks which have enjoyed windfall profits from foreign exchange trading as well as lower provisions in the light of falling interest rates. HSBC Holdings has jumped from 19th place to 8th, though that also reflects its acquisition of Midland Bank and the astonishing buoyancy of the Hong Kong market. The latter factor has also helped boost Standard Chartered, up from 259th place to 165, while the merchant banks have also reflected the buoyant state of financial markets. Both SG Warburg and Schroders moved up smartly, while Kleinwort Benson entered the rankings at 492. Falling gilt market yields and lower bank base rates have also put a different perspective on the property market. Land Securities jumped to 108 from 136th place in the rankings. Hopes that the construction industry would benefit from lower interest rates boosted building materials suppliers. Redland rose to 132 from 166. It was helped also by its extensive interests in Germany where rebuilding has continued in the east despite the recession in the west. Curiously, the yield attractions which have boosted the electricity companies (Southern, Eastern and Midlands Electricity all moved up among the leaders), has been less in evidence in the water sector. This may reflect worries about the cost of capital investment required to meet EU standards. In some cases this is compounded by concern about diversification into unregulated markets. Severn Trent, Northwest and Anglian Water all moved lower. Among individual companies it has been a remarkable recovery year for British Aerospace, up to 231 from 464 as restructuring of its aerospace business and recovery in the car market starts to bite. Having finally managed to increase its prices, British Steel jumped to 147th place from 229. With the new management installed by Hongkong Land making its presence felt, Trafalgar House joined the rankings at 319th position. Reed Elsevier and Zeneca also joined, the former on merger, the latter on its demerger from ICI. Mirror Group was another addition. Departures included Charter, Ranks Hovis McDougall (bought by Tomkins), British Vita, Pentland Group, Iceland Foods and Courtaulds Textiles.</p>

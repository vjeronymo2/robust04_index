			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / IMF warns Moscow of delay in financial support for rouble FINANCIAL SUPPORT for Russia from the International Monetary Fund could be delayed if the government in Moscow dilutes its macroeconomic and monetary policies, Mr Michel Camdessus, the IMF managing director, warned yesterday. He told a press conference in Washington that the creation of the planned Dollars 6bn (Pounds 3.3bn) stabilisation fund for the rouble 'could take some time'. During this period Russia and the other countries in the so-called rouble zone would be expected to establish some market credibility for the rouble and comply with conditions set by the IMF. Although the fund wanted to move ahead with providing Russia with a proposed Dollars 4bn standby credit as quickly as possible, this too could take time if the IMF were to be faced with a weakening of Russia's economic reform policies, Mr Camdessus added. Russia is hoping agreement on the standby loan can be reached next month in a move that would unleash extra financial support from the west and set in train a rescheduling of the official debts of the former Soviet Union by the Paris Club of creditors. Mr Camdessus spoke against a background of growing concern in Washington that Russia might be backsliding on its commitments to low inflation, currency stability and economic reform. At another news conference, Mr David Mulford, the US Treasury undersecretary for international affairs, said the reported dilution of Russia's economic policies would be 'one of the issues at the top of the agenda' when Mr Yegor Gaidar, Russia's deputy prime minister, joined part of Sunday's discussions among the Group of Seven finance ministers and central bankers. Both the IMF and US Treasury will want Mr Gaidar to tell them what policy changes, if any, are under way in Russia. So far their only information, including the suggestion that Russia should adopt a crawling peg (adjustable exchange rate) for the rouble, has come from press reports. A meeting of ministers from the Group of Ten industrial countries is expected next Monday to activate a dormant IMF financing facility, known as the General Arrangements to Borrow, so that a stabilisation fund can be set up. But Mr Mulford made clear that there was no agreement yet about when the fund should be operative. Mr Camdessus underlined that there were many hurdles to be overcome before Russia and the other rouble zone countries among the former Soviet republics - those which have chosen to retain the old Soviet currency - could benefit from the fund. Mr Camdessus said Russia would have to implement credible macroeconomic and monetary policies. The rouble would have to be backed by realistic interest rates, control over credit policy and support in the markets. The members of the rouble zone would have to be committed to monetary co-operation, with arrangements in place to manage the currency properly, he said. A weakening of monetary policy would not help the creation of a rouble stabilisation fund, Mr Camdessus said. Nor was he enthusiastic about the idea of a crawling peg. The fund was intended to provide an anchor for the rouble. But if the exchange rate were to be adjustable under a crawling peg arrangement, the rouble would have a 'sliding anchor', and that was not what the IMF had in mind.

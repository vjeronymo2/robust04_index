			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Bed-and-breakfasting on Friday, April 3 1992. People who want to reduce their 1991-92 CGT bills by establishing allowable losses, therefore, must not leave things until the very last minute, writes Ralph Newns. For a shareholding or other investment which has become virtually worthless, a negligible value claim can be submitted on April 1 or 2, under section 22 (2) of the CGT Act 1979. The April Retail Price Index has consistently been significantly higher than the March figure (between 1 per cent and 3 per cent higher in recent years) so it is always worth waiting until the first couple of days of April to make negligible value claims, so as to establish the highest possible loss for CGT purposes. If you miss the statutory deadline of April 5, it is possible to put in a retrospective claim by virtue of extrastatutory concession D28 (published in the free Revenue booklet IR1) but it is generally better to claim one's rights under the law than to have to ask for the tax relief by concession. Traditional bed and breakfast deals, namely a sale in the afternoon and a purchase next morning, do not work for what-is-called 'relevant securities'. Briefly, these are: securities covered by the accrued-income scheme; deep-discount securities; shares etc in non-qualifying offshore funds. To establish an allowable loss on a holding of convertible loan stock, for example, requires particular care (including consideration of the consequences under the accrued income scheme rules), because the settlement day for the reacquisition must be later than that for the sale. There is no room to go into details here, but the principles will be familiar to readers who recall the transactions which replaced traditional B&amp;B between the 1982 and 1985 Finance Acts and which became known as board and lodging. It is worthwhile to restate the basic principles of traditional bed-and-breakfast for listed shares (excluding shares in offshore funds, as mentioned above): there must not be any agreement on Day One (the day of the 'bed' sale) that a 'breakfast' purchase will take place on Day Two; full beneficial ownership must pass to the counterparty on Day One. These basic principles are readily satisfied on the Stock Exchange, of course, but they make it virtually impossible to do an effective B &amp; B outside the Exchange.

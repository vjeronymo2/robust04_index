			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / UK Company News: African side gives boost to Paterson Zochonis PATERSON Zochonis, the detergents and Cussons soap manufacturer, announced a 7 per cent increase in annual profits, from Pounds 26.7m to Pounds 28.6m pre-tax, helped by a strong contribution from Africa and a Pounds 3m increase in investment income. Mr Alan Whittaker, finance director, said strong advances in most of the group's international businesses had helped to offset a decline in Greece. Sales for the group as a whole were 3 per cent higher at Pounds 233.4m, against Pounds 227.3m. At the operating level, Paterson showed a 24 per cent fall to Pounds 12.3m for the year to May 31. However, 1992's figures had been flattered by a Pounds 7.3m debt repayment from the Nigerian government, leaving the underlying 1993 operating profits ahead 39 per cent. Mr Whittaker said the African businesses had benefited from a stable Nigerian currency and higher sales. Profits from associated companies, mainly in Nigeria, more than doubled from Pounds 2.7m to Pounds 5.6m. The UK exporting business benefited from higher sales to the Middle East and eastern Europe. In Greece, bumper olive harvests hit olive oil prices, leaving that business with lower profits. During the year, Paterson also made its first acquisition in three years with the Pounds 3.2m purchase of a recently-privatised Polish detergents manufacturer. This business, with estimated annual turnover of some Pounds 20m and an 8 per cent share of the Polish powder detergents market, had contributed a small profit for the two months it was included. The group expected to double capacity over three years with a Pounds 4.75m investment programme. Mr Whittaker said the acquisition had 'whetted our appetite for more in eastern Europe'. Paterson has a hefty war chest, with investments in equities and currencies totalling Pounds 167.1m and a further Pounds 2.4m in cash. The buoyant stock market helped investment income rise by Pounds 3.1m to Pounds 16.4m. The final dividend is increased to 10.25p for a total of 12.6p (11.45p). Earnings were ahead 6 per cent at 35.83p (33.79p).</p>

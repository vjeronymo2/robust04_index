			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Chinese will be encouraged to buy cars China will soon begin providing incentives to individual car buyers to help boost its fledgling automotive sector as part of a policy aimed at encouraging widespread car ownership. Speaking after a two-day conference in Beijing, Mr He Guangyuan, China's minister of machinery, said that individuals would become the main purchasers of cars and the incentives were designed to encourage this trend. Mr He did not provide details but it seemed he was proposing that bank loans or other forms of finance be made available to facilitate car purchases. The official China Daily newspaper reported officials responsible for the automotive sector as saying that to 'increase sales the state will introduce incentives to car buyers to boost market demand'. Individuals, as opposed to companies and work units, make up only a fraction of car owners. Of the estimated 1.2m cars on China's roads 5 per cent are owned privately, according to China Daily. Mr He also announced the government would increase its support over the next two years for four existing car makers in an effort to boost production. China's new automotive policy sets as its goal the development of a mass production automotive sector by early next century to meet an expected booming demand for cars. China's production goal for the year 2000 is some 1.35m cars, with 90 per cent of the market to be supplied from local production. Output would rise to 4m by the year 2010. In 1993, China produced 234,000 passenger cars out of total production nationwide of 1.3m vehicles. More than 300,000 vehicles including trucks, commercial vehicles and cars were imported. Among manufacturers singled out for government support were those in which Volkswagen of Germany and Daihatsu of Japan are involved. Mr He did not provide details of assistance, but Beijing recently announced it would provide additional funds for the automotive sector. The authorities are also making clear they will play an active role in the rationalisation of an industry whose production has hitherto been scattered among dozens of small inefficient plants, some of which produce a few vehicles each month. Thousands of components manufacturers are also being warned that unless they achieve economies of scale through mergers or joint ventures with foreign partners they will be forced out of business. Mr He announced that some 350 components businesses out of an estimated 4,800 throughout China would get government assistance. Again, no detail was provided of the form this assistance might take. China has placed a freeze on new automotive manufacturers entering the market until 1996, but international companies are being urged to participate in upgrading the components sector. Such companies as Ford, GM, Toyota and Nissan, have been told that to participate in the components sector is virtually a prerequisite for permission to become involved in manufacturing. This has prompted a scramble for Chinese partners among component suppliers.</p>

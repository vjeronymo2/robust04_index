			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / Wace launches inquiry into Clegg years WACE GROUP said yesterday it had launched a 'wide-ranging inquiry' into all aspects of the company during the eight years Mr John Clegg built it into the world's largest pre-press printing specialist. Mr Clegg resigned as chief executive last Friday after speculation had linked the company to the Irish Republican Army. Security sources said they had uncovered no evidence of such links. Mr Clegg denied the allegations but told the board last week that potential future speculation would focus on his family, making it embarrassing to the company for him to continue on its board. Senior executives within the group, under pressure from shareholders, are understood to be anxious to prepare a full response to the continuing uncertainty about the company. They have broadened their investigations to include members of Mr Clegg's family. 'It is absolutely vital to insure that no misconduct took place,' Mr Brian Dudley, who succeeded Mr Clegg as managing director last week, has written in a memo to the group's employees. One area under scrutiny concerns the source of money Mr Clegg used to buy into Wace in 1983 when it was a small loss-making shell company. He has repeatedly said since then that he was backed by his cousin, Miss Jayne Wright, who had inherited wealth and had emigrated to South Africa. The company has established little about her so far but most of her shareholding in Wace was sold in late 1988 for about Pounds 8m. Mr Clegg offered at last week's board meeting to 'produce Miss Wright within two weeks', according to a senior Wace executive. He resigned during the meeting and has not been available for comment since. Individuals connected with Wace have been the subject of investigations by a number of authorities over the past year. These culminated in a meeting in London last June attended by representatives of the Royal Ulster Constabulary's C13 anti-racketeering squad, the Serious Fraud Office, the Stock Exchange's Insider Dealing Group and the Bank of England. These investigations followed earlier police inquiries in Sheffield where Mr Clegg grew up. Little about the Clegg family's South African connections have surfaced to date. Mr Clegg's father, John senior, emerged last November as the purchaser of 7m shares in Clegg Holdings, a South African paper and packaging company. Mr Harry Clegg, chairman of Clegg Holdings, said he was no relation to the Yorkshire Cleggs but he had met the son. He said his relationship with Mr Clegg Snr dated back to 1987 when Clegg Holdings was listed. Mr Clegg Snr had written a letter saying he was interested in investing in the company. The holding stands at 23.3 per cent.</p>

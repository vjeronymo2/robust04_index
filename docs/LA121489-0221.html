			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE;  </P> <P> SANTA DEBATE FINDS PROFS POLES APART  </P> <P> Santa Claus works at the North Pole to avoid taxes and regulations, delivers  his toys in the dark of night to elude Customs agents and is a master of the  free enterprise system, a college professor jokingly asserted Wednesday.  </P> <P> His management style "would make the Japanese blush with envy," declared Don  Booth, professor of economics at Chapman College during a mock college debate  on the topic, "Santa Claus: Entrepreneurial Genius or Capitalistic Spy?"  </P> <P> On the Santa-as-spy side: "Haven't you ever wondered how Santa flies around  without setting off Russian radar?" queried Robert Slayton, a history professor  at the college. In fact, he alleged, St. Nick's "Stealth Sled" is little more  than a spy plane financed by the U.S. Department of Defense.  </P> <P> What's more, Slayton argued, the image of Santa as a kind and gentle  philanthropist is bunk.  </P> <P> The jolly man in the red suit exploits his workers and discriminates against  children with different religious or ethnic backgrounds, Slayton told about 60  students who attended the debate.  </P> <P> Through extensive research, Slayton said, he discovered that Santa operates a  sweatshop type of organization, where workers toil many hours for scant wages  and minimal benefits until they are very old with long white beards. "The  working conditions are terrible!" he shouted.  </P> <P> Slayton argued that by giving his loot to some children and not others, Santa  discriminates against those with different beliefs and cultures.  </P> <P> "Santa has corrupted Christmas, made it the symbol of class warfare," he said.  "Moral values have been replaced by materialism and the slogan has changed from  'Good will to all,' to 'What did you get?' "  </P> <P> But Booth was unswayed by his colleague's presentation. Santa "should be  revered as a creative, rugged individual" and a role model for business  executives worldwide, he said.  </P> <P> Santa's entrepreneurial success can be traced to his management style, Booth  explained. "Working for Santa is such a pleasure that most people do not ask  for any salary other than the joy they bring to others." MATT LAIT  </P></p>

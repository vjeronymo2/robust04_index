			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / UK News (Employment): Union row over N Sea pay deal A DISPUTE between leaders of unofficial industrial action in the North Sea and official unions broke out publicly yesterday as union leaders said they were prepared to sign a pay and conditions deal that would fall short of the terms they originally demanded. Leaders of the Amalgamated Engineering Union responded sharply to criticism of union tactics from the leaders of unofficial action. Mr Gavin Laird, AEU general secretary, said the criticism was 'singularly unfortunate' and would inhibit union recruitment. In spite of efforts to get most of the 20,000 contract workers to register with unions in order to hold a ballot on industrial action, AEU leaders said only 7,000 had registered. That meant the ballot would have to be postponed indefinitely. Talks between unions representing contract construction workers and leaders of offshore contracting companies are due early this week. Among those taking part will be Mr Jimmy Airlie, AEU executive councillor, and Mr Tom McLean, the construction section national secretary. Mr Airlie said he would be prepared to sign a deal providing conditions were met. That would mean unions would re-enter an agreement covering work on 'hook up', or the construction of rigs, which they abandoned two years ago because employers would not extend union recognition to the 'post-hook-up' phase of rig maintenance. They would accept instead a model set of terms and conditions from the Offshore Contractors Council in return for undertakings including an end to the alleged blacklisting of 460 workers who took part in industrial action, and the right to recruit workers offshore. That stance has been strongly criticised by the Offshore Industry Liaison Committee because the unions have accepted that they will not be able to obtain a broad continental-shelf deal covering all North Sea workers. Leaders of unofficial action are this week expected to announce that they may form a non-TUC union covering oil and gas workers. Mr Airlie said that a continental-shelf agreement remained a long-term aim of unions but they had to accept that they were not yet strongly organised enough to achieve it. The AEU leaders were speaking at the start of the Scottish Trades Union Congress in Dundee yesterday.</p>

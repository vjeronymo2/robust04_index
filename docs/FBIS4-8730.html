			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Suman, chairman of the </F> parliamentary Defense and Security Committee, by Jiri Hracek;  place and date not given: "Czech Officers Were Screened by  Former Communist Party of Czechoslovakia Members"]    [Text] Last week, the Defense and Security Committee of the  Chamber of Deputies discussed the results of the screening of  the Czech Army officers. The committee assumed a very critical  stand regarding both the process and the results of the  screening. We asked Deputy Vladimir Suman (Civic Democratic  Alliance), chairman of the Defense and Security Committee, for  an explanation.    [Hracek] Sir, during the assessment of the results of the  screening of the Czech Army officers at the open session of the  Defense and Security Committee, you have commented rather  skeptically on the approach used. What led you to this  criticism?    [Suman] You must know that our committee adopted a  resolution, in which it expresses its dissatisfaction with the  results of the special screening of the professional soldiers.  Several serious factors led us to this stand. True, the  examinations were broadly implemented and included practically  all professional soldiers. This means that thousands of people  passed the test. It seemed remarkable to us that of this large  number, only 60 officers were described as unsuitable for  service -- that is approximately 0.3 percent of those who passed  the screening. Another important reason for our dissatisfaction  was the method of implementing the examination. Our committee  received information from many places that in numerous units  people very closely connected with the Ommunist regime were  appointed to the screening commissions. We know, for instance,  that in one of the army units the examinations were conducted by  a former member of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia [KSC]  Auditing Commission and also a former chairman of the Division  Committee of the KSC. In some instances, these people screened  professional soldiers who never joined the party. This  situation led to the refusal by some officers to be screened  under these circumstances, while others passed the screening but  left the army in protest against this principle. At a session  of the committee, Deputy Fejfar (Civic Democratic Party) quoted  from a letter from these officers.    [Hracek] Is there an overall report on the current  appointments to all leading posts in the army at all levels?    [Suman] The Defense and Security Committee requested from  [Defense] Minister Baudys a list of all people who were, as of 1  November 1989, agents of counterespionage or military  counterespionage. The list should include the staff of the KSC  political instruction apparatus and former military screening  officers. Each name entry should include the army function  under the communist regime and the reasons for leaving the army,  if applicable. We are also interested in whether these people  work in the army.    [Hracek] Are you worried that in case of a crisis, our  country could be internally threatened by these people who still  are in the army?    [Suman] In a discussion with the defense minister, we  reached  the conclusion that the majority of our officers would defend  the sovereignty of the Czech Republic. Regarding internal  security, I believe that the economic and political character of  this state has been decided without any chance of the return of  the former regime.</p>

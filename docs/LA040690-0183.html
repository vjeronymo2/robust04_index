			<p><P> April 6, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> UAL OKS EMPLOYEE BUYOUT;  </P> <P> $4.2-BILLION DEAL STEMS PROXY FIGHT  </P> <P> UAL Corp. directors announced today that they have agreed to sell United  Airlines to its employees in a $4.2-billion deal that would create the nation's  largest employee-owned company.  </P> <P> The agreement was struck in round-the-clock negotiations between the UAL board  and a group the employee unions set up to stage a buyout, United Employee  Acquisition Corp.  </P> <P> The move heads off a threatened proxy fight with the parent company's largest  shareholder but puts UAL back in a familiar position -- floating a deal with  uncertain financing.  </P> <P> Under the agreement, worth $201 a share, employees will exchange $155 in cash,  $35 in UAL notes and an estimated $11 worth of securities in UAL subsidiary  Covia Corp. for each UAL share.  </P> <P> There was no immediate word on how the deal was to be financed. A source close  to the negotiations told Associated Press that the parties had no firm  financing for the deal.  </P> <P> UAL, parent of United Airlines, said it expects to conclude a final agreement  promptly.  </P> <P> At a news conference today in New York, representatives of the unions said the  agreement calls for employees to give up $2 billion in concessions over five  years, including $300 million in the first year and $500 million in the fifth  year.  </P> <P> The breakdown of ownership in the new company would be as follows: pilots  owning about 37.9%; machinists owning about 35.7%, non-union employees about  14.3% and flight attendants about 12%, the unions said.  </P> <P> Machinists' union Vice President John Peterpaul predicted that banks would look  favorably on the deal.  </P> <P> UAL's largest shareholder, Coniston Partners, immediately called off its  threatened proxy fight to oust the company's board at the April 26 annual  shareholder meeting. Coniston holds an 11.8% stake.  </P> <P> The announcement met with a lukewarm reaction, however, from some analysts, who  questioned whether banks would be willing to back the bid without a strong  management group behind it.  </P> <P> The fate of UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf has been in doubt because of union  indications made before today that they would dump Wolf in the event of an  employee buyout.  </P> <P> Pilots union head Frederick Dubinsky said in New York today that Wolf would be  replaced.  </P> <P> "It's our intention to put together a top-notch senior management team . . .  and that will include a new (chief executive officer)," he said.  </P> <P> UAL's stock opened up $3.50 a share at $169 on the New York Stock Exchange but  by midday had slid back to $165.50, unchanged from Thursday.  </P> <P> The agreement marks another chapter in a takeover saga that began in August  when Los Angeles investor Marvin Davis made a $5.4-billion offer for the  company. Davis said earlier this week he would not make another bid.  </P> <P> But his initial offer sent United's pilots and management scrambling to come up  with their own bid. In September, UAL directors accepted a $6.75-billion offer  from the pilots, management and British Airways PLC that also included labor  and wage concessions.  </P> <P> The proposal was killed after the would-be purchasers were unable to line up  enough financing.  </P></p>

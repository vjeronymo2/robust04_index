			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / Easter views dispel south-west's fear of false dawn IN THE south-west the holiday weekend has largely borne out estate agents' hopes that the recent signs of greater activity in the housing market would not prove to be a false dawn. Mr Michael Saunders, managing director of Fulfords, a south Devon chain of 26 offices, said: 'It is safe to say that we have had the busiest Easter probably for five years.' The picture varied across the region. Mr Saunders added: 'The general perception is that we've turned the corner. We have had little peaks before but it is continuing - and even more encouraging is that we are now selling mid-range and more expensive houses again.' One estate agent said it was a myth that Easter was a crucial time for the property market, but the overall verdict was that the weekend had maintained the more buoyant trend of the last three months. Agents spoke of prices firming - especially at the lower end of the market - of a shortage of some types of property, and of a renewed interest in holiday homes. Mr John Smith is south-west director of Connells, with 10 offices including Bristol, Bath, Chippenham and Swindon, which were open for all four days of the holiday. 'We were very busy and all the signs are that the market is carrying on as in the previous few months,' he said. Demand earlier in the year was mostly from first-time buyers, now it was more evenly spread. Another agent who reported an active Easter was Mr Dowell Conning, south-west regional operations director of the Royal Life subsidiaries Allen &amp; Harris and Gribble, Booth &amp; Taylor, which total 80 offices. He said: 'Good Friday saw an unprecedented demand, certainly in recent times. There was more interest, offers and positive response. Saturday was brisk but not so busy.' He added: 'We have moved from amber to amber beige - not exactly 'go' yet. 'The property market in my region started to decline in August 1988 and I'm reluctant to sound too optimistic but I think we are now on our way. House prices quarter on quarter have ceased to fall for the first time in five years,' he said. 'There's no doubt in my mind that we have had continuous interest for some time and in another month the market will have its own momentum - we're not quite there yet.' Mr Conning said buyers from London were emerging for village properties in areas such as Devon.</p>

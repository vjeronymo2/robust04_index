			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Sufyan Abu-Zayidah, a prominent Fatah </F> official in the Gaza Strip, by Amnon Levi -- live]    [Text]    Levi: Fatah and Hamas [Islamic Resistance  Movement] have signed a cooperation agreement and disseminated  it this weekend in a joint leaflet, which deals with  collaborators, strikes, and demonstrations. It fails, however,  to even mention the peace agreement or Israel. Sufyan  Abu-Zayidah, what is this agreement all about?    Abu-Zayidah: First, this is an internal agreement  in the Gaza Strip. It is not related to the peace process, but  rather to the internal relations between the Palestinian people  in the Gaza Strip.    Levi: It broaches issues which relate to your  daily affairs, such as the issue of collaborators, does it not?    Abu-Zayidah: Precisely. The leaflet first of all  calls for a propaganda lull between the two organizations, and  this is a natural thing. It also calls for halting the  assassination of people suspected of collaboration -- and this  is the important thing. I have always struggled against Hamas  and the rejectionist front organizations -- and within our  organization as well -- with a view to stop the assassination of  people suspected of...    Levi interrupting: How many suspects are being  assassinated monthly, in your estimation?    Abu-Zayidah: In the Gaza Strip at least 10-15  people are killed every month.    Levi: You just find a corpse lying around  somewhere in the morning?    Abu-Zayidah: We find somebody who has been killed  because he was suspected of being a collaborator. People are  very concerned about this.    Levi: What about other issues, such as  distribution of land?    Abu-Zayidah: Yes, this issue directly relates to  Israeli rule. When the Israelis announced their intention to  withdraw soon, people started worrying about what will happen to  state-owned land. In the past people who took over state-owned  land were fined. Now people have practically stormed these lots.    Levi: Is this leaflet part of Fatah's efforts to  assume authority in the Gaza Strip in anticipation of the  withdrawal?    Abu-Zayidah: We do not regard Fatah as being in  authority, but rather the entire Palestinian people.    Levi: This is a nice slogan, but Fatah will be in  control.    Abu-Zayidah: We want the entire Palestinian  people to rule, not Fatah.    Levi: I read in the newspaper that the  Palestinians believe this agreement is historic. Why is it so  important?    Abu-Zayidah: It is important because we are in the  midst of a critical period of transition. The entire world,  including the Israelis, believe that once the IDF [Israel  Defense Forces] pulls out there will be a massacre in the Gaza  Strip and armed militia, Lebanese style, will roam the streets.  Via this leaflet, as well as in meetings held over the last  three days, we are trying to prove that this will not happen.  The Palestinian nation is mature and will abide by the peace  agreement. It will manage to sustain all the internal contrasts.    Levi: Are you aware of the fact that Israelis are  concerned about a Fatah-Hamas agreement, because we regard Hamas  as a murderous terror organization?    Abu-Zayidah: I am aware of this. You have a  problem in this respect, because you think that every Hamas  member wants to chase you with a knife. The truth is that Hamas  represents 30 percent of the Palestinian people. It is in the  interest of Fatah, the PLO, and the peace process, that Hamas be  included rather than excluded from the Palestinian regime.    Levi: How is it, then, that you did not include  even one clause of support in the peace process, if not in  Israel itself?    Abu-Zayidah: We are constantly exerting great  efforts to keep Hamas close to us. We have not succeeded in  terms of what you call stopping the armed struggle, because at  the present time they do not ask us before they carry out  attacks.    Levi: This weekend the agreement may be signed,  and in two or three weeks Gaza could be in your hands. Aside  from the great joy, are you also afraid?    Abu-Zayidah: I am not afraid, but I hope we will  succeed.</p>

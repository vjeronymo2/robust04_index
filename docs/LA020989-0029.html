			<p><P> February 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TITANS TO MEET NO. 19 NEVADA LAS VEGAS  </P> <P> Cal State Fullerton, coming off an upset of UC Santa Barbara that was the  Titans' biggest win of the basketball season, faces a bigger challenge tonight  as the Titans play host to 19th-ranked Nevada Las Vegas in a Big West  Conference game tonight at Titan Gym.  </P> <P> The Rebels (15-5 overall and 10-1 in the Big West) handed Santa Barbara a 77-61  loss Monday in a game that was never close after the first 10 minutes.  </P> <P> Fullerton (9-10 and 4-6) lost the first meeting with UNLV this season, 66-63,  on a desperation 3-pointer by Greg Anthony just before the buzzer.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Martin Hacthoun] </F>   [Text] Havana, 10 Jan (PL) -- John Savage, prime minister  of the Canadian territory of Nova Scotia, has initiated an  official round of interviews here with Cuban authorities.  Savage is heading a delegation of businessmen interested in  initiating trade relations with the island.    The group accompanying Savage is comprised of  representatives  of 16 Nova Scotian companies. Nova Scotia is a territory on  Canada's Atlantic coast. The entrepreneurs see Cuba as a place  with real business prospects.    "Taking into account the business opportunities available in  Cuba, the entrepreneurs accompanying me are very eager and  interested in doing serious business with the island," Savage  said. Savage is making the first working visit to Cuba in 17  years by a provincial chief of state.    The delegation was welcomed by Foreign Trade Minister  Ricardo  Cabrisas Ruiz and Carlos Martinez Salsamendi, president of the  Cuban Chamber of Commerce, who briefed the visitors on the  current economic situation in Cuba, its problems, and  development prospects, as well as on the availability of capital  investment opportunities.    Savage, who became prime minister with the Liberal Party in  a  landslide victory last May, said that the results of the trade  probe and discussions the group expects to complete will surely  be mutually beneficial.    There are now 400 companies that maintain trade relations  with the island. There are 112 companies or joint ventures in  operation, 22 of which are with the Canadian capital.    Canadian Ambassador to Cuba Mark Entwistle commented that  the  Canadian entrepreneurs have a growing interest in the Cuban  market, where they find commercial and investment stability.    Cuba is Canada's fourth most important trade partner in  Latin  America, and first in the Caribbean and Central America.    During their stay, Savage and his commercial delegation will  also be greeted by Lionel Soto, vice president of the Council of  Ministers; Nicolas Rodriguez, the acting foreign minister; the  ministers of health, fishing industry, and agriculture; and  Ricardo Alarcon, the president of Parliament. They will also  visit centers of scientific and economic interest.    Cuba maintains certain agreements, especially in fishing,  with the Atlantic Province of Nova Scotia, whose Halifax Bay is  the world's second largest and is the site of heavy trade  traffic. Now Cuba will be able to broaden such ties to other  areas.</p>

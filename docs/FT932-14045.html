			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / Businesses lack computer failsafe FOUR IN five British businesses and public-sector organisations do not have viable contingency plans for computer failures, a survey published yesterday revealed. In spite of the critical role computer systems play in most of the organisations surveyed, barely half had so much as a written contingency plan to cope with serious computer malfunctions. The findings come from a survey of 421 UK organisations conducted this year by Loughborough University for International Business Machines. Excluding users - notably in the financial and public-services sectors  - obliged by law to have plans, only 42 per cent were found to have adopted formal plans. One in five had an untested plan, while a further 15 per cent of plans were held to be 'doubtful' as they had not been recently updated. The researchers say: 'With the pace of technological change, it is doubtful if any plan will remain completely viable for more than six months. Yet only 27 per cent of the organisations had completed plans that recently - nearly a third of plans were more than two years old.' Ironically, computer services companies were among the worst performers  - only 39 per cent had a plan, and 14 per cent a viable one. Local authorities and research companies also performed badly - only 18 per cent of councils had a tested plan. Only in the financial services and utilities (gas, water, electricity and power generation) sectors were more than a third of plans deemed to be viable. A recent survey sponsored by the Department of Trade and Industry said British business losses through breaches in computer security and physical damage to systems were running at more than Pounds 1.6bn. More than eight in 10 of the organisations claimed to have computer insurance, but the report says cover tends to apply to hardware even though 'greater damage usually results from corruption of data or consequential losses'.

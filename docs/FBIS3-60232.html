State Councillor Song Jian and other leaders from the  central  and local governments took part in the meeting, which was  sponsored by the Environmental Protection Committee of the State  Council.    Speaking at the meeting, Xie Zhenhua, director of the State  Bureau of Environmental Protection, said that total proven coal  reserves in the adjacent area of Shanxi-Shaanxi-Inner Mongolia  now reach over 280 billion tons.    He said that reasonable exploration of coal resources in the  area is of great significance to promoting the development of  the national economy.    But, he added, natural conditions in the area are poor due  to  an overemphasis on exploration, to the detriment of  environmental protection.    As a result, the environment was seriously polluted in this  area, with much coal wasted and a large portion of topsoil  washed away, he said.    He added that the central government has paid very close  attention to environmental protection in developing natural  resources in the area.    He urged taking forceful measures to reorder coal  exploration  and strengthen supervision over environmental protection work in  this area.    In the near future, he continued, the urgent task is to  clear  out rivers to ensure that flood peaks pass safely in the coming  year.    The participants also investigated the serious soil damage  in  the area due to natural resource exploration.</p>

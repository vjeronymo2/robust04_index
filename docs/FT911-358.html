			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / Ministers unworried by idea of two-speed Emu: EC representatives start to look at the realities of economic and monetary union 'The prospect of a two-speed monetary union was raised - and no one was shocked,' said Luxembourg's finance minister, Mr Jean-Claude Juncker, after he finished chairing an informal meeting on Saturday of EC finance ministers. This indeed was the weekend - at the probable half-way point in the EC's negotiations on economic and monetary union (Emu) - that realities of various kinds set in: The reality that there has been far more talk than action in getting the Twelve's economies to converge on sound budgetary principles. The reality that, even with crash adjustment programmes in weaker EC economies, the Twelve will not be able by the late 1990s to move in perfect unison to a single currency. The reality that there is little practical difference in granting a grace period to a country (Britain) which is for the moment politically unwilling to join Emu and granting one to countries which are economically unable to do so for a while. The reality that Germany has monetary might, and perhaps right, on its side in arguing against setting up a fully-fledged European Central Bank until it has a real job (running a single currency) to do. Mr Jacques Delors said Saturday's meeting was 'the best discussion we have ever had on convergence'. He was referring to the general endorsement that ministers gave to the idea that the Community should soon start designing specific 'adjustment' plans for countries with chronic spending deficits and/or double digit inflation. The EC's monetary committee has suggested three candidates - Italy, Greece and Portugal - for adjustment programmes. Mr Delors played down this innovation, noting that Greece had already submitted itself to EC scrutiny in return for an EC balance of payments loan, while Portugal and Ireland had called on Brussels for technical help in setting budget policy. But introducing specific EC surveillance, well before the planned 1994 start of the formal Emu transition phase, and extending it to all Twelve (as France and Spain suggested), is sure to stir controversy. Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor of the exchequer, said that, even after 1994, the necessary deficit-pruning and anti-inflation measures should be left to individual governments. As a form of monetary convergence, Mr Anders Rasmussen, the Danish finance minister, suggested that from 1994 on, the fluctuations in the narrow EMS band should be reduced from 2.25 to 1.5 per cent, and that in 1996 the wider 6 per cent band (within which sterling and the peseta currently gyrate) should disappear altogether. But for all such adjustment programmes, ministers generally recognised that a two- or multi-speed move to Emu was inevitable, a forecast that many of them and Mr Delors himself had earlier decried when it came from the lips of Mr Karl Otto Pohl, the Bundesbank president. It was important to 'de-mystify' a two-speed Emu, Mr Delors said. The likelihood, he said, was that a majority of countries would assume the Ecu as their single currency in the late 1990s, and that those countries staying outside the Emu for a time would have their currencies linked to the Ecu, by something similar to today's European Monetary System. After Saturday's meeting, the Commission president refused to elaborate on his idea, hinting indeed that he might have been precipitate in raising it so long before the expected wrap-up of Emu negotiations in the autumn. Signalling clearly the likelihood that the UK would sign the Emu treaty could still cause the Major government problems with diehard anti-EC Tories in the run-up to the UK general election that could also come this autumn. Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the French finance minister, echoed Mr Delors, saying: 'The treaty must be written so that it does not pre-empt a UK decision, while at the same time allowing the Emu process to go ahead.' Mr Philippe Maystadt, finance minister of Belgium, which like France wants fast movement to Emu, described as the Delors idea as interesting. But Mr Carlos Solchaga, the Spanish finance minister, said he thought 'it could create more problems that it would solve'. He appeared to worry that if the UK got its let-out clause, it would leave Spain more isolated in the negotiations. For economic reasons, Spain wants a relatively lengthy transition to Emu, but for political reasons does not want to be lumped with the likes of Greece in getting a special grace period. On the vexed issue of when the European Central Bank (ECB) should be set up, Mr Beregovoy sought to smooth over differences with Germany, with his officials talking only of an institution 'pre-figuring' the ECB being set up in 1994. Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, remained as firm as ever in insisting that the ECB should only be established on the eve of a single currency, and that calling any lesser institution the ECB would be dangerously misleading. 'Wrong labels can lead to wrong behaviour,' Mr Waigel said.</p>

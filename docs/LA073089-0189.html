			<p><P> July 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AUTO GRAPHS  </P> <P> My lady and I recently toured Spain by car and had reserved a budget-econobox,  a Ford Escort 1.3, from Hertz in Madrid. The first surprise was being told that  particular car would not be available for our rental: Hertz quietly upgraded us  to a larger, faster, four-door 1.6 liter model at no extra charge. The second  surprise was receiving the bill based on Hertz Affordable Europe rate: We had  the car for 16 days, drove 1,800 miles, yet the total came to only $430.  </P> <P> This week I received the following letter from Hertz:  </P> <P> "A review of our records indicates that the currency exchange rate applied on  your rental was incorrectly computed at the time of check-in.  </P> <P> "Recomputing the exchange rate allows us to credit your account $5.71. A refund  check will be sent within two to three weeks. Please accept our apology for  this error."  </P> <P> If Hertz has a favorite charity, it has just earned $5.71.  </P> <P> If Hertz is interested in rental loyalty for a lifetime, it has mine.  </P> <P> PAUL DEAN  </P> <P> Woodland Hills  </P></p>

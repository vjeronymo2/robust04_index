			<p>Language: <F P=105> Vietnamese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] As of today, 24 January 1994, the midterm national  party conference had gone through five days of intensive and  boisterous work with a high sense of reponsibility to the party  and the people.    This conference is an important political event in the  political life of our party and people. The conference is  designed to review the actual situation to continue to step up  the renovation process -- a process that is being undertaken in  a changing and complex world situation.    The conference vociferously debated the Seventh Communist  Party of Vietnam [CPV] Central Committee's political report  presented by Comrade General Secretary Do Muoi at the conference.    Following the sixth party congress, the seventh party  congress [as heard] has, over the past few years, substantiated  and further perfected the renovation policy through its  political platform and its socioeconomic development strategy  which chart the course for the renovation to be carried out in a  more extensive, harmonious, and steadier fashion along the  socialist path. However, the renovation process, which is  something new to us, is carried out at a time when the world  situation is developing in a complex manner and when there are  many new arising problems to be resolved promptly.    Over the past few days, during their debates -- either in  group debates or collective debates -- and during their  refreshment breaks, the delegates enthusiastically discussed and  unanimously agreed with those essential matters cited in the  political report, ranging from the review of the implementation  of the seventh party congress resolution to the summming up of  the actual situation of the renovation process, and the  determination of major policies and measures aimed at firmly  defending the country under all circumstances to successfully  implement the seventh party congress resolution.    The delegates unanimously noted the three major achievements  scored by our country, the most important being the fact that we  have been able to overcome by a very important step the state of  socioeconomic crisis, continue to maintain and consolidate  political stability, broaden foreign relations, improve our  country's prestige and position in the world, and thereby create  a favorable international environment for our national  construction and defense.    Against a background of a complicatedly changing world and a  domestic situation plagued with difficulties, what has been  achieved by us attests to the correctness of the party's policy  and the appropriateness of its steps. Our national revolution  has been and is being carried out in the right direction along  the path of consolidating national independence and building  socialism -- the path chosen by our Uncle Ho, our party, and our  people.    These great achievements have generated new stature and  strengths and new opportunities for us to gradually shift to a  new stage of development where we can further accelerate our  national industrialization and modernization. Besides these  opportunities, the Vietnamese revolution is also facing new  challenges, new deficiences, and new problems. Generally  speaking, all the delegates unanimously agreed with various  points summed up by the party Central Committee in its political  report. These points are:    -- Although having achieved some economic development, our  country remains one of the world's poorest countries.    -- Despite its faster pace of economic growth, there is the  danger of being left further behind economically compared to  nearby countries.    -- While we want peace and development, hostile forces are  resorting to various schemes and tricks aimed at realizing their  peaceful evolution strategy. We must always heighten our  vigilance against this.    -- Our socioeconomic development, though guided along the  renovation process, has given rise to many problems to be  correctly dealt with if we are to keep our country from straying  off the socialist path.    -- Corruption and other social ills, which have not been  dispelled, are causing serious losses economically and a drop in  the people's confidence.    All these are challenges to be overcome on the road toward  development. Though not too optimistic, all the delegates firmly  believed in the success of the renovation process. This is  because we have, over the years, drawn on many useful lessons  from objective realities. These lessons call for firmly  maintaining the socialist course during the renovation process,  linking the persistence in principles and revolutionary strategy  with the flexibility in tactics, and remaining sensitive to  acquire new things. While regarding as necessary the carrying  out of the renovation in a comprehensive and uniform fashion, we  must adopt appropritate steps, forms, and methods. We must also  maintain the party leadership and state management in carrying  out the commodity-based multisectoral economic development. We  must develop socialist democracy, discover and correctly resolve  those problems newly arising in renovation process. We must pay  attention to reviewing realities, constantly supplement and  gradually perfect our theory about the path toward buidling  socialism.    The delegates unanimously agreed that although the  renovation is an unprecedentedly difficult process, we have  boldly found a way out, bravely marched forward, and scored very  important successes. The most basic and most decisive factors  are that our party has held a ruling role, that we do not accept  pluralism and a multiparty system, that we have upheld a sense  of independence, sovereignty, and creativity, that we have  adopted a policy and line in conformity with the pattern of  activity and the realities of Vietnam and that we have been able  to develop the integrated strengths of the all-people great  solidarity bloc and to broaden our international relations.    With a high sense of responsibility, all the delegates,  whatever their field of activity, have expressed their sympathy  for and contributed their views to unfailingly achieving the  orientations and tasks for the period ahead as outlined in the  political report, which calls for spurring a change in the  econonomic mechanism along the direction of industrialization  and modernization, consistently implementing the multisectoral  economic development policy, and creating a driving force and  more favorable environment for various economic components and  various forms of enterprises to develop quickly and to achieve  high results. We must harmoniously build the market system  under the state management along socialist direction.    The delegates contributed numerous views on the tasks of  caring for, fostering, and developing the human factor as a  driving force and a goal of the revolution. The most prominent  issues discussed consist of achieving social justice, improving  intellectual standards, ameliorating the society, and preserving  and developing the identity of folk culture.    Fighting corruption -- a present burning and pressing issue  -- was also given attention by the delegates who unanimously  agreed that the fight against corruption must be carried out in  a resolute and drastic fashion in our entire working apparatus  covering various echelons and sectors from the central down to  local levels.    Not only was the national security and defense issue given  attention by delegates from the armed forces but it also  received the views of almost all the participants who called for  maintaining political stability, fighting the enemy's peaceful  evolution strategy, and preventing social negativism.    Most of the delegates also paid attention to the  party-buiding and mass motivation tasks, especially the task  regarding cadre organization. Some believed that we must have a  consistent cadre organization policy that calls for not only  gathering and propagating the younger generation of  officially-trained party cadres and members but also for  rallying the generation of party cadres and members with good  records and experiences. They said that not much has been done  in the spreading of propaganda on the party, especially among  the younger generation, and that theoretical studies, especially  the study of the theory on socialist construction, has not met  requirements for attractiveness and for ideological guidance and  actions among society.    Many delegates also analyzed the role of grass-roots party  organizations at the village and ward levels, especially those  in the rural areas and in mountain regions and those belong to  state-, state-private, and privately-run economic  establishments. They stressed the need to establish order and  discipline within party organizations, improve daily party  activities, both in terms of format and contents, to increase  leadership skills, militancy, and the ability to fulfill the  duties of the entire party and of each party echelon.    Delegates noted those results obtained in mass motivation in  the past and pointed out the need to continue to strengthen  leadership and guidance in a more practical fashion for the  activities of various mass organizations, regarding this as an  important factor to contribute to increasing the militancy and  leadership skills of the party. As clearly outlined in the  political report delivered by Comrade General Secretary Do Muoi,  lying ahead of us is a new stage with promising prospects and  great challanges that must be definitely overcome by us, and  with opportunities that must be fully exploited. All of our  party, Army, and people must be of the same heart and minds and  must be united as one, trying to struggle to bring the  renovation forward so as to score even-greater successes.    After four days of debates held in the form of both group  debates and collective debates, the CPV Central Committee's  political report delivered by Comrade General Secretary Do Muoi,  today, 25 January 1994, delegates to the midterm national party  conference held group debates, discussing and exchanging views  in preparation for a by-election of members to the Seventh Party  Central Committee.    Tomorrow, 25 January, the conference will be in plenary  session at the conference hall.</p>

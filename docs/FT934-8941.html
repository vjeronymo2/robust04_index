			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / International Company News: Air Canada turnround continues in quarter A LEANER, more competitive Air Canada continued its turnround in the third quarter despite slow economic recovery and slack operating revenues. It reported third-quarter operating revenues of CDollars 1.03bn (USDollars 795m), up 2 per cent from a year earlier, and operating income of CDollars 94m, against CDollars 39m. It was the fourth consecutive year-to-year gain at the operating level and an improvement over the June quarter. Final net profit was CDollars 43m, or 56 cents a share (fully diluted), against a loss of CDollars 14m, or 19 cents. For the nine months, revenues rose slightly to CDollars 2.73bn and operating income was CDollars 82m, against a loss of CDollars 97m. After restructuring and financial charges, the net loss was CDollars 236m, or CDollars 3.20, against a loss of CDollars 307m or CDollars 4.14. Air Canada has raised about CDollars 200m with the issue of 35m units at CDollars 5.75 per unit to an underwriting group led by RBC Dominion Securities. Each unit comprises one new common share and one half a warrant. A full warrant will allow the holder to buy one Air Canada share for CDollars 6.25 over the next two years.</p>

			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / International Company News: Merck buys into generic drugs sector Merck AG has become the latest German pharmaceuticals concern to buy into the generic drugs business. It said yesterday it would buy 51 per cent of the capital of Amerpharm, a generic drugs manufacturer controlled from the Netherlands. The price of the deal was not revealed. Merck said Amerpharm had sales of Dollars 104m in 1993 and earnings before interest and taxes of Dollars 15m. Generics manufacturers specialise in launching products whose patents have expired. The business is growing quickly because of the number of big-selling drugs whose patents are running out. Mr Hans Langmann, Merck executive management president, said the company might have to finance the acquisition through capital markets or 'equity-linked measures'. Merck will be taking control of Amerpharm from the South African Tabatznic family, which has a long association with the generics business. The family would continue to hold a significant stake in the operation, said Merck.</p>

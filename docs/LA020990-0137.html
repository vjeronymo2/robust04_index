			<p><P> February 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HAYES, BING, MONROE IN HALL OF FAME;  </P> <P> BASKETBALL: NEIL JOHNSTON, A SCORING CHAMPION IN THE 1950S, IS ALSO SELECTED  FOR MAY 15 INDUCTION.  </P> <P> Elvin Hayes, Dave Bing and Earl (The Pearl) Monroe were elected to the  Basketball Hall of Fame on Thursday.  </P> <P> Also chosen was the late Neil Johnston, the Philadelphia Warriors' hook-shot  artist who led the NBA in scoring for three consecutive seasons in the early  1950s. All will be inducted on May 15.  </P> <P> Hayes, who starred at the University of Houston in the late '60s and ended his  16-year NBA career as the league's third-leading all-time scorer, said making  the Hall of Fame is a dream come true.  </P> <P> "It's just unreal," Hayes said. "It's just like winning your first high school  basketball championship or your first NBA championship. It's just one of those  feelings. You work so hard and have your dreams and then it happens."  </P> <P> Hayes, who played for the Rockets in San Diego and Houston, and the Bullets in  Baltimore and Washington, was the NBA rookie of the year in 1969, when he led  the league with 28.4 points a game.  </P> <P> He averaged 21 points and nearly 12.5 rebounds a game for his career and was  named to 12 All-Star teams. He was the league's top rebounder in 1970 and 1974.  </P> <P> Monroe, rookie of the year for Baltimore in 1967-68, averaged 18.8 points in 12  seasons with the Bullets and New York Knicks, who he helped to the 1973 NBA  title.  </P> <P> Bing was rookie of the year in 1966-67 with the Detroit Pistons. He led the  league in scoring, averaging 27 points a game the next season. He averaged 20  points and nearly six assists during his 12-year career with Detroit,  Washington and Boston.  </P> <P> During eight seasons with Philadelphia, Johnston led the NBA in scoring in  1952-53 and 1953-54 and in both scoring and rebounding in 1954-55. He was named  to six All-Star teams before a knee injury ended his career in 1959.  </P></p>

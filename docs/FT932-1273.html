			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / UK and US react angrily to annulment of Nigerian election NIGERIA'S political crisis deepened last night as Britain and the US responded angrily to General Ibrahim Babangida's decision to annul the presidential poll held earlier this month. The move, announced by Nigeria's military ruler yesterday morning, makes the promised August 27 handover to civilian rule most unlikely and has left the country in a political limbo. Strongly worded statements from the Foreign Office and State Department made clear that London and Washington have lost patience with Gen Babangida, who has put back the handover date on three previous occasions. The US described his move as 'outrageous' given that the elections were considered 'free from any serious irregularities'. Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, said the decision was 'bound to have serious implications for Nigeria's relations with the international community and the UK will have no option but to reassess its own bilateral relations with that country'. Gen Babangida's action is likely to have caused a loss of support for Nigeria's efforts to reschedule its Dollars 30bn (Pounds 20bn) external debt, and the country's already grave economic plight is likely to deteriorate. Gen Babangida did not disclose the government's next move, but he is expected to broadcast his plans to the nation later this week. There was no official reaction from the Social Democratic party (SDP) or its candidate, Mr Moshood Abiola, who is generally acknowledged to have beaten his rival, Mr Bashir Tofa of the National Republican Convention (NRC), by a clear majority in the poll on June 12. The SDP's supporters in their Yoruba stronghold in the south-west will be especially upset. Power has resided in the mainly Moslem and Hausa-dominated north of Nigeria for most of its 33 years of independence and many Christians and southerners - the driving force of the economy - saw the polls as their chance to move the balance of power. Gen Babangida's motives remain obscure, but many Nigerians believe he never intended to stand down. The statement from his office says that the decision was made 'to preserve the honour and esteem of the judicial system', which ended last week in confusion. A shadowy group calling itself the Association for a Better Nigeria, which called on Gen Babangida to stay in office until 1997, won a court order last week that halted counting. The chairman of the electoral commission initially invoked a decree that made it possible to override the judiciary in the election process. But in an about-turn last Wednesday, the chairman accepted the court's ruling, which had been contradicted in two other federal courts, and refused to announce the winner.

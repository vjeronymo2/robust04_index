			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Gay Bekhor and Aluf Ben] </F>   [Excerpt] In an interview with HA'ARETZ on 21 February,  Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa reacted to the various publications  which have been saying that Mubarak's regime is under a threat:  "This is idle talk, an interpretation based on wrong  assumptions, a serious exaggeration, a misunderstanding of the  reality in Egypt, and a significant deviation from the truth."    This is the first reaction by an Egyptian official to  reports  published in the British weekly SUNDAY TIMES according to which  U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that there is a real  chance that President Mubarak will not be able to hold on to his  position due to the pressure of Islamic terror.    Foreign Minister Musa rejected these reports outright. "This  is not Islamic extremism, but instead extremism in the name of  Islam. These extremists have nothing to do with Islam." Lashing  out at religious terror elements in Egypt several days ago,  Husni Mubarak made similar remarks.    Asked for the best way to handle Islamic terror in his  country, Musa said: "The only way is to have terrorism curbed  by the government and the security forces, which they are doing.  At the same time, the reasons for this extremism are known.  The long-term economic reform plan will take care of the  extremism."    During the interview Minister Musa asked if we would use the  term "terror activity," and not "Islamic terror activity." He  explained that "the government is now taking very powerful steps  on the ground in terms of security and maintaining public order.  I believe, therefore, that terror activity will diminish."    Musa did not specify the number of supporters of the  Egyptian  terror and the extent of their influence, but said: "I believe  the figures are on the decline because the reforms and the  determined activities against those gangs will clearly diminish  their abilities."    Answering a question on who is behind terror activity in  Egypt and who should be blamed for it, he said: "Many domestic  and external elements are behind the terror. I would rather not  elaborate." When asked whether it is Iran, he said he would not  mention names. He repeated that "the claim that the activities  of the terror gangs in Egypt might destabilize the very  existence of the current regime is definitely an exaggerated  interpretation."    U.S. evaluation elements have estimated that Mubarak's  regime  is in danger, but amended their assessment and now believe that  the Egyptian administration is stable enough and has managed to  develop the appropriate tools for dealing with fundamentalist  terror.    A report received in Jerusalem several days ago says that  the  updated assessments of the U.S. evaluation elements indicates  that the Egyptian regime is basically stable and able to deal  with crises. The evaluation also says that Egypt has a long  tradition of and broad support for the government which has  managed to absorb shocks in the past, such as after the death of  President 'Abd-al-Nasir in 1970 and the murder of President  Anwar al-Sadat in 1981.    According to the U.S. evaluation, the Egyptian regime will  endure even if Mubarak personally loses power.    The evaluation elements disagree on whether fundamentalism  is  a different phenomenon in each Middle East country or whether  there exists a "domino effect" and mutual influence of  fundamentalist Islam acts in Algiers, Egypt, Jordan, and the  Gaza Strip.    The annual intelligence report, presented to the government  some four weeks ago by Major General Uri Sagi, head of the  Israel Defense Forces Intelligence Branch, says that  fundamentalism would be a source of concern in the long run if  it succeeds in toppling the regime of one of the neighboring  countries such as Egypt or Jordan. At the same time it does not  pose an immediate threat. The report states that there is no  danger that the Egyptian Government would fall this year.    Israeli analysts are following the situation in Egypt and  have recently presented the political echelons with reports on  the Muslim movements there, but did not find that the Egyptian  Government is in danger.

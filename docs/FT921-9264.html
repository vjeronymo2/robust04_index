			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / Business Law: Gulf war aftermath highlights risks of performance bonds The economic fall-out from the Gulf war has emphasised the inherent risks in performance bonds which are used in international trade. These bonds were designed to be easy to call on - but there is always the corresponding danger that banks and British suppliers may have to honour calls for repayment which are based on false statements made by purchasers. Once a bond is in place, the law can do little or nothing to prevent payment, no matter how unfair this may seem. The current political situation in the Gulf, combined with the number of British companies supplying goods to Iraq and involved in the ambitious Iraqi building programme before war broke out, make it likely that a disproportionately large amount of capricious claims will emerge from Iraq. After the invasion of Kuwait the UK government, along with the European Community and the US, imposed sanctions on Iraq, and these included the prohibition of payment under performance bonds to Iraqi residents. Many British suppliers must have been relieved: those who had failed to meet commitments as a result of the Gulf war would not have to fund payment under the bond as long as sanctions were in place. However, once the sanctions are lifted, the banks will have to pay if they receive a demand that meets the requirements of the bond, whatever the circumstances. For this reason, banks must continue to safeguard their right to claim a counter-indemnity from suppliers. Suppliers have therefore found to their cost that banks are, quite legitimately, not releasing security while there is a possibility that they may have to make a payment under a bond. This possibility will remain unless a demand under the bond is withdrawn or - and this is most unlikely - unless the UK enacts further legislation to absolve suppliers and their banks from liability to Iraqi banks and purchasers, in appropriate circumstances. Current sanctions prevent all payments under performance bonds with Iraq - even those called justifiably, in connection with events or defaults by suppliers before the hostilities. Once sanctions are lifted, suppliers who defaulted prior to hostilities will clearly not have grounds for complaint when payment has to be made. But more worryingly, some suppliers are bound to be victims of unjustifiable calls; in addition, suppliers who are unable to meet their contracts because of the hostilities will nevertheless be expected to pay if they receive a call. In order to understand the potential weaknesses of performance bonds more fully, and to consider how to avoid capricious calls, it is necessary to consider how the bonds work. As a rule, a bond is issued by a bank at the request of its customer - the supplier - who is selling goods or services to a purchaser, usually based in another country. The bond is normally issued in favour of a purchaser's local bank, so that he can pursue any claim in his home country. The supplier agrees to indemnify his bank against any payment it might have to make as a result of the bond. The supplier's bank then asks the local bank to issue the bond and provides it with a similar indemnity. This contract between the two banks may contain a pitfall for suppliers: depending on how the bond is negotiated, the contract may be governed by the law of the local bank. This is to be avoided if possible, as it may leave suppliers uncertain as to how any dispute might be resolved. The underlying contract between supplier and purchaser will almost certainly provide that, if the supplier defaults, the purchaser can call on the bond. He can do this by making a simple demand for repayment and, if required, by producing relevant documents. It is important to bear in mind that the purchaser does not need to prove any allegation of default. When the purchaser makes a demand, this sets off a chain of indemnity. The local bank is obliged to pay the purchaser, triggering the local bank's call on the supplier's bank, and the supplier's bank's call on the supplier. The banks are not concerned with any dispute as to whether the supplier is in breach of his agreement with the purchaser. A bank which fails to pay without good cause can suffer immense damage to its international reputation. The purchaser is not usually required to give reasons for his demand, apart from, in some cases, a statement that the supplier is in breach of obligations to the purchaser, or that the purchaser has asserted such a breach. This means that unscrupulous purchasers can demand payments from the bank or local bank, even if there has been no breach of the underlying contract. Indeed, some purchasers regard the calling of performance bonds as a legitimate way to obtain a discount. To avoid being outmanoeuvred in this way, suppliers should ask their banks to include wording that requires the purchaser to substantiate his complaint. However, some purchasers and local banks make an outright refusal to accept anything other than the traditional wording. Ideally, purchasers should be required to make a series of detailed statements and to produce documents in a given form. This should discourage some from making false statements. Those not so deterred will at least be committed to a stated position which may be of use to the supplier in any subsequent legal dispute. However, the use of a fuller demand still does not require banks to check the truth of the statements or to refuse payment because they might be false. The sole exception occurs in all cases when the bank has manifest evidence of fraud - but such evidence is hardly ever available and the bank cannot be expected to adjudicate between the parties. If sanctions against Iraq are lifted, it is most unlikely that a supplier will be able to enlist help from the English courts to prevent payment under the bond, even if he cannot now perform his side of the underlying agreement because of the Gulf war. Some have suggested that a supplier could invoke the legal doctrine of frustration by claiming that the Gulf war had made it impossible for him to fulfil the underlying contract, thereby discharging the obligation between himself and his bank, or between his bank and the local bank. This ploy is unlikely to work, however. As a matter of law, the doctrine of frustration is not invoked by hardship, inconvenience or material loss. Instead, it focuses on any change in the significance of a contractual obligation. Since the obligations under the bond are independent of the contract, it would be irrelevant to argue that the contract itself had been frustrated by the hostilities. It is difficult to see any circumstances in which the obligations imposed by the bond could be avoided by frustration or otherwise as a result of the Gulf war. It is even more difficult to say whether the government should consider further measures to absolve suppliers and their banks from all liability in appropriate cases. There would be practical difficulties, especially where obligations between the supplier's British bank and the Iraqi local bank are governed by Iraqi law and/or by an Iraqi exclusive jurisdiction clause. In such cases, any pronouncement by the UK is unlikely to affect the liability of the supplier's bank to the local bank. If the supplier's obligations under the bond were cancelled by English law, this would leave his bank potentially out of pocket through meeting a call under the bond from the Iraqis, without being able to claim counter-indemnity from the supplier. There is also the wider concern that London should continue to be seen as a world financial centre in which bonds will be honoured, come what may, without government interference. If obligations under bonds to Iraq were discharged - albeit due to what we might consider to be exceptional circumstances - this reputation would be tarnished. The lesson to be drawn for the future is that suppliers whose customers ask them to take out a bond should consider the ramifications carefully and take good advice. Those who already have bonds in place with Iraq can only hope for the continued protection of sanctions. It is interesting to note that current sanctions against South Africa apply only to trade in military equipment, broadly speaking. It is unlikely that payment under performance bonds will be singled out for special treatment and continue to be prohibited, if the government should choose to modify its objective of preventing the inflow of capital to Iraq.

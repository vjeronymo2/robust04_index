			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "U.S. Sees Reason"] </F>   [Text] "My experience in public life suggests that there is  far more value to keeping my mouth shut at times than to  speaking" was Republican senator, Mr Hank Brown's riposte to  Assistant Secretary of State, Ms Robin L. Raphel, during the  U.S. senate foreign policy panel hearing on South Asian affairs.  The season of reason seems to have just dawned on Washington  politics. The American flip-flop on strategic issues, especially  issues concerning the sub-continent never ceases to amaze policy  watchers. India is one day a primitive, human rights abuser and  becomes a non-cooperative nuclear nation another day, all thanks  to the benevolence and quirkiness of Washington ditherers. Till  yesterday, President Bill Clinton was testing his writing skills  on the Punjab issue and trying his vocal chords on the Kashmir  absurdities. As if to prove the promptness of his administration  in dealing with strategic issues with immediacy, his staff was  very prompt in responding to dubious organisations and painted  India as a country of primitive inhabitants bent upon killing  each other. Today, suddenly, the Clinton administration comes  across precious evidence that India is a very big country, that  there is a thriving democracy which has over a long period of  time evolved democratic institutions and is in the process of  addressing human rights abuses and adhering to international  human rights standards. One is certain many Indian hearts swell  with pride at hearing such pious outpourings by the greatest  democracy on earth. But what explains for the American policy of  yesterday? Did policy makers in Washington not realise that  India with its continental dimensions, inhabited by different  ethnic, religious and language groups, surrounded on one side by  a country bent upon stoking the fires of terrorism and  separatism, remain incident-free, trouble-free and  violence-free? Why has it taken the Yanks so long to realise  that the Government of India was doing its best to come to grips  with an extremely volatile situation in a manner that at the  same time did not lead to much loss of life? Why did it not  recognise that the thousands of humans who sacrificed their  lives to bring peace to the Punjab were policemen, who became  common fodder to the terrorist bullets? Should a developing  country spend enormous amounts of money and hire American  lobbyists to open the eyes of lords in Washington to see home  truths about India? It is pathetic to see a super power which is  so indecisive. One only hopes that it does not chance upon some  new evidence, suitable to its needs, and change its policy  tomorrow. The loser would not be India, for, international  community knows by now, the human rights record of India. It is  the United States of America that will lose its face. In its own  self-interest, the United States needs to evolve a realistic,  long-term strategy for the sub-continent.</p>

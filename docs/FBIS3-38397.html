			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "rmc."/DW: "FDP Advocates Dividing </F> Bundeswehr Into Two Parts"]    [Text] Bonn -- Defense experts of the Free Democratic Party  of Germany [FDP] and the Social Democratic Party of Germany  [SPD] have called on FRG Defense Minister Volker Ruehe  (Christian Democratic Union -- CDU) immediately to present a new  concept for the army. When a "position paper on the Bundeswehr  after the year 2000" was presented yesterday, FDP security  politician Guenter Nolting reproached Ruehe for a "thought ban,"  which is virtually in force in his ministry. Apparently,  Chancellor Helmut Kohl (CDU) is only marginally interested in  security policy and does not use his authority for guidelines.  The FDP is concerned over the fact that the "lack of political  targets set for the Armed Forces by the responsible ministry has  led to inactivity without concepts."    SPD Defense Expert Andreas von Buelow also talked of a  thought ban in the Defense Ministry. The Hardthoehe [seat of  the Defense Ministry] rejected the reproaches as unfounded.  Defense Minister Ruehe will publish "conceptual guidelines for  the Bundeswehr" in April, a spokesman said.    In Nolting's opinion, the Bundeswehr has to play an  important  role within the framework of a joint foreign and security policy  of the European Union (EU). During the presentation of the  position paper, Nolting took the view that a European foreign  and security policy "also has to represent European interests  all over the world" in coordination with NATO. It is  conceivable that the Bundeswehr then will also be confronted  with new tasks. The FDP politician proposed dividing the  Bundeswehr into two parts -- that is, into "national defense  forces" with a training organization where draftees are trained  in basic military service of "less than 12 months" and into  "combat-ready armed forces" consisting of professional soldiers,  long-term servicemen, and draftees serving a longer time (up to  23 months). Buelow advocated reducing the basic military  service to half a year and a troop of 100,000 professional  soldiers.</p>

			<p><P> March 30, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH, COSTA MESA;  </P> <P> THIRD-GRADERS GET ARBOR DAY TREES  </P> <P> The Rotary Club of Newport-Balboa has distributed 1,800 seedling trees to  third-graders in 28 public and private schools and special educational programs  in Newport Beach and Costa Mesa.  </P> <P> This is the 22nd year in which the club has delivered trees to celebrate Arbor  Day, according to Donal C. Noonan, Arbor Day committee chairman.  </P> <P> National Arbor Day falls on April 27, while California Arbor Day was earlier  this month.  </P> <P> "We chose third-graders because they have reached the age of reason, if you  will," said Noonan. "They are old enough to adopt a tree and nurture it. As  they would grow, so would the tree."  </P> <P> Each year, the Rotary Club chooses a different species and purchases the trees  from an Irvine nursery. This year's selection was the star pine, a native of  Norfolk Island in the South Pacific.  </P> <P> "We explain to the children that we are living on a coastal desert plain," said  Noonan. "There are no trees here that weren't planted by man or a  third-grader." LESLIE HERZOG  </P></p>

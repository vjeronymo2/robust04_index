Estonian Defense Minister Indrek Kannik said at a news  conference Thursday that the mission members discussed with  Estonian officials ways to step up the country's cooperation  with NATO, in particular the setting up of a consulting  mechanism which would work in crisis situations, joint military  exercises and training of Estonian officers. They also  discussed what Estonia could offer NATO.    Hermann von Richthoff, the mission head, emphasized that  Partnership for Peace was not hostile to any country. He said  that joint exercises with NATO could be staged in Estonia in  1993 [as received].    General K.-T. Steinkopf, a mission member, said that NATO  could not sell weapons to countries that were not its members  but Baltic states could buy them from NATO members in bilateral  deals.    The NATO team has left for Latvia from where it will go on  to  Ukraine and Moldova.</p>

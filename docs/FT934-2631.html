			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Tax credits hit service industry Sir, Martin Feldstein (Personal View, December 10) presented the opportunity to boost jobs at no cost through the use of investment tax credits (ITC). Basic economic theory should alert us to being offered a free lunch, and in this case some of the consequences of ITCs were not spelled out. Broadly speaking, the 'benefit' of an ITC is a tax incentive for the companies making approved investments. The cost is higher taxation on all companies not making approved investments. Professor Feldstein suggests that approved investments would be money spent on equipment and possibly construction. The government is in no position to be the best judge of whether to encourage expenditure by companies on investment as opposed to anything else, or an arbiter of which types of investment are better than others. Inevitably, ITC schemes have been used effectively to subsidise manufacturing investment at the expense of service industry. Policymakers should resist the temptation to meddle further in the allocation of resources and concentrate on reducing the distortions within the current taxation system instead.

			<p><P> January 16, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> An ex-Israeli intelligence officer blamed a Palestinian faction for blowing up  a Pan Am passenger jet over the Scottish village of Lockerbie last month and  killing 270 people. Raphael Eitan, a former high-ranking officer in the Mossad,  Israel's intelligence agency, told Scotland's Sunday Post that those  responsible "belong to a little-known Palestinian faction calling themselves  May 15. The man responsible is Abu Ibrahim." A British Foreign Office spokesman  gave little credence to the report. Meanwhile, The Sunday Express newspaper in  London said a member of the U.S. armed forces may have been duped into taking a  bomb on board. The story followed reports that U.S. troops in West Germany had  been offered money to take packages of diamonds to New York.  </P></p>

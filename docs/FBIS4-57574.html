			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Alfonso Malespin Jiron] </F>   [Text] Yesterday, Presidency Minister Antonio Lacayo  virtually proclaimed his presidential candidacy for the 1996  elections. He did so on Radio Ya when speaking in favor of an  organization he called "Democratic Convergence."    During his extended interview, he said the political right  "is trying to glamorize former President Daniel Ortega so he,  who is politically depleted, will run in the 1996 elections and  lose and they, the right, will win. But," he cautioned, "they  are forgetting about us -- the Democratic Center."    The announcement was made when Carlos Guadamuz, director of  that radio station, asked Lacayo if he will run as the head of  the convergence, to which Lacayo also refers as the Center. The  minister answered: "One word to the wise is sufficient."  Lacayo said: If this Convergence "believes I am the person  who has led the country's economy down a good road" and decides  to nominate me, "I will not evade this task."    He then noted that what is important is that the political  center win. He positioned the government of Violeta Chamorro,  who does not belong to any party, in this center. The Chamorro  administration was born of a 14-party alliance.    Lacayo said the political center will "choose the best  Nicaraguan for the 1996 candidacy" and that as long as there is  a centrist government, the right does not stand a chance of  winning the 1996 elections."    Lacayo noted, as he did two weeks ago in Mateare, that the  people do not want "the liberal-Somozist option" or the  Sandinists to win the elections because the country would be  polarized. The presidency minister said that a centrist  government is necessary to "control the extreme right and the  extreme left."    According to Lacayo, Democratic Convergence must not  function  on the basis of personalities, "as this would generate division  and jealousy and because the work must not favor any particular  candidate, even if the candidate is Antonio Lacayo."</p>

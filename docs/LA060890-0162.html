			<p><P> June 8, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SMALL BUSINESS / JANE APPLEGATE: HOW UPSTART FIRM CAN OUTSMART A GIANT  </P> <P> The fact that more people around the world use toothbrushes than any other  consumer product inspired the founders of Healthgard to develop a new  toothbrush-sanitizing solution.  </P> <P> But because they couldn't compete head-on with the giants of the oral hygiene  market, they started selling Brushgard in health food stores. Brushgard, a  stable form of hydrogen peroxide, comes in a bottle that acts as a toothbrush  holder. Each bottle lasts for about 10 days and costs $1.39.  </P> <P> Entrepreneurs competing nose-to-nose against the Goliaths in their industries  say the only way to succeed is to figure out an innovative way to sell your  product. Since you can't outspend a big corporation, you have to outsmart it.  </P> <P> Inglewood-based Healthgard and Pro-Dentec of Batesville, Ark., share the  personal products arena with Colgate-Palmolive, Procter &amp; Gamble and Bausch  &amp; Lomb. You won't see ads for Brushgard on television or in magazines.  </P> <P> "I was looking for the path of least resistance," Jim Grant, Healthgard's  marketing director and an officer of the company, said of the decision to sell  Brushgard in 1,800 health-food stores.  </P> <P> He originally planned to introduce Brushgard to hotel guests concerned about  bathroom cleanliness. He changed his mind when he met a woman who worked for a  natural food chain. She thought Brushgard's sales pitch -- "Fact: Toothbrush  bacteria can make you sick!" -- might appeal to health-conscious shoppers.  </P> <P> So far, the strategy is working. Managers at several health food stores said  customer interest in Brushgard is growing and sales are picking up.  </P> <P> Healthgard Chairman Allen Gelbard said a group of his friends dared each other  to come up with the most lucrative consumer product. Seeking guidance from a  computer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Gelbard discovered that  the toothbrush was the most universal consumer item.  </P> <P> "Toothbrushes cross over all ethnic barriers," said Gelbard, who previously  produced movies and worked in the telecommunications business.  </P> <P> Since the toothbrush and toothpaste market was glutted, he worked with dental  researchers to create a related product.  </P> <P> To raise capital, Healthgard recently merged with a public company called  American Water Resources. The move brought in about $1 million cash.  </P> <P> While Healthgard is busy cleaning toothbrushes, Pro-Dentec is busy cleaning  teeth with Rota-dent, a device that uses a variety of circular brushes to do  its job. Pro-Dentec also came up with a creative marketing solution. The  company decided to sell Rota-dents directly to dentists after realizing that  dental product distributors, which push 2,200 products, could not aggressively  sell their line. But selling directly to dentists is not easy.  </P> <P> "The problem is, most dentists think it's unprofessional to sell things out of  their office," said Bill Evans, Pro-Dentec's executive vice president and  marketing director.  </P> <P> To gain credibility in the dental community, Pro-Dentec sponsors about 100  continuing education seminars for dentists and dental hygienists around the  country each year.  </P> <P> "We are selling Rota-dents to one dentist at a time," said Evans. Evans said  dentists, who used to spend most of their time filling cavities, are now  focusing on helping patients keep their teeth and gums healthy. The change in  direction is a result of widespread use of fluoride treatment -- a development  that has nearly eliminated cavities.  </P> <P> Pro-Dentec brought Rota-dent to the United States six years ago under a  licensing agreement with a Danish company. Dentists charge $90 to $125 for the  sleek, hand-held cleaner. The cost includes at least one lesson on how to use  the device.  </P> <P> Rota-dent's closest competitor is the Interplak tooth cleaner, which was  acquired by Bausch &amp; Lomb in 1988 and is sold through a variety of retail  outlets.  </P> <P> At first, Evans said, the Copenhagen-made Rota-dents experienced terrible  quality control problems. To solve the problem, Pro-Dentec acquired the  manufacturing rights and moved the factory to Arkansas.  </P> <P> So far, about a million Rota-dents have been sold worldwide, 800,000 in the  United States. Pro-Dentec, which has about 150 employees, posted sales of $6.9  million for the first six months of this year.  </P> <P> Each week, the company sends out thousands of brochures to dentists. Its sales  team is on the phone to dentists every day. If dentists express interest in the  product, they are sent audiotapes or videotapes produced in the company's  in-house studios.  </P> <P> Evans recommends that small-business owners develop their own marketing plan  before hiring an advertising agency.  </P> <P> "Save your money until you figure out how to sell it first," said Evans, who  laughs when he recalls the first time he pitched the Rota-dent to dentists.  </P> <P> Hearing that a group of dentists were attending a charity golf tournament at  the Lake of the Ozarks Country Club, he and a colleague raced out to the golf  course. "I sold 200 toothbrushes from a golf cart that day," he recalled.  </P> <P> </P> <P> MARKETING BOOKS  </P> <P> There are several good marketing books to help small-business owners gain a  competitive edge:  </P> <P> "Big Marketing Ideas for Small Service Businesses," by Marilyn and Tom Rose.  </P> <P> This comprehensive book includes direct mail tips, advertising campaigns and  ways to generate free publicity.

It is published by John Wiley &amp; Sons, 605 3rd Ave., New  York, N.Y. 10158. $14.95.  </P> <P> "The Marketing Sourcebook for Small Business," by Jeffrey P.

			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> KENNEDY WINS SOCCER TITLE IN MATCH HALTED BY OFFICIALS  </P> <P> Officials stopped a soccer match at Kennedy High on Wednesday when the ejection  of a San Fernando player caused teammates and spectators to rush onto the  field. Kennedy won, 2-1, to clinch the Mid-Valley League title.  </P> <P> Problems began after a disputed penalty kick by Brian Singer provided Kennedy  with its winning margin with less than 10 minutes to play.  </P> <P> San Fernando's Jose Ochoa was given a yellow card for arguing the call. Minutes  later, teammate Enrique Moreno was ejected. San Fernando players and spectators  then came onto the field and the game was stopped.  </P> <P> An official was kicked but was not injured. There were no confrontations  between opposing players.  </P> <P> "Bad officiating let the game get out of hand," San Fernando Coach Arturo  Vasquez said. "The referee didn't let the kids express themselves. He ejected  (Moreno) for no reason at all."  </P> <P> Kennedy (12-2-1, 8-2) opened the scoring in the early minutes on a breakaway  goal by Jeff Abrams. San Fernando tied the score late in the first half on  Ricardo Coyt's penalty kick from 15 yards.  </P></p>

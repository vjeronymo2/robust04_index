			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TRAFFIC SNARLED, 1 TREATED IN SULFUR SPILL  </P> <P> A truck-trailer rig carrying bags of sulfur dumped part of its load across  three lanes of the eastbound Riverside Freeway on Wednesday, prompting a  shutdown of the eastbound lanes and causing major delays for rush-hour  commuters.  </P> <P> More than 1,200 pounds of powdery sulfur in 50-pound sacks tumbled from the  truck's rear trailer and spilled onto the freeway, creating an irritating  pungent cloud and sending one motorist to the hospital.  </P> <P> The accident occurred just east of the Santa Ana Freeway at 3:05 p.m., said  Angel Johnson, a California Highway Patrol spokeswoman.  </P> <P> Eastbound traffic was stopped for more than six hours, causing "major"  congestion on nearby surface streets as CHP officers rerouted motorists to the  Santa Ana Freeway, Johnson said. Scores of other motorists were stranded behind  the spilled load.  </P> <P> Joyce Bourcier of Anaheim, who lives about a block and a half from the accident  scene, said she heard about it on her way home from Long Beach and got off the  freeway earlier than usual -- but to no avail. The surface streets were  clogged, too.  </P> <P> "It still took me forever to get home," she said.  </P> <P> Firefighters used water hoses to decontaminate two motorists and the  tractor-trailer's driver, Paul Leroy Miller, 42, of Corvallis, Ore. Their  vehicles also were hosed down.  </P> <P> Miller, who was hauling 150 50-pound bags of sulfur he had just picked up at a  Buena Park chemical company, drives for Nix Transportation Inc. of Albany, Ore.  He was cited for the spilled load, Johnson said. She said Miller was headed for  Northwest Retreaders Co., in Portland, which uses the sulfur in a compound to  retread tires.  </P> <P> Miller told officers he was traveling about 45 m.p.h. on the connector from the  Santa Ana to the Riverside Freeway when he noticed one bag falling, followed by  nearly two dozen others.  </P> <P> As the bags hit the pavement they burst open, sending up a cloud of sulfur that  obscured the vision of Manoutchehi Ahmadi, 51, of Anaheim, who was following  Miller's rig. Ahmadi braked after his air conditioning system filled the  interior of his sedan with fine, yellow sulfur dust, Johnson said.  </P> <P> Ahmadi's car was then struck from behind by a pickup driven by Jeff Potter, 27,  of Mira Loma, who told CHP officers his tires lost traction as they passed over  the slick sulfur.  </P> <P> Ahmadi was taken to Martin Luther Hospital in Anaheim for observation after he  complained of breathing difficulties.  </P> <P> Sulfur in powder form can cause eye and skin irritation and is highly  flammable.  </P> <P> "It could have caught fire just from the exhaust from (passing) cars because it  ignites with heat," said Buena Park Fire Capt. Ed Endemano.  </P> <P> The sulfur was swept into barrels and hauled away by a hazardous-materials  company, which was dispatched by California Department of Transportation  officials.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Riverside Freeway Traffic Tie-Up  </P> <P> Truck dumped sulfur across three lanes of the eastbound Riverside Freeway  </P></p>

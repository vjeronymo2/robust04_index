			<p>930903 FT  03 SEP 93 / Arts: Three hotels - Theatre THREE HOTELS at the Tricycle Theatre, Kilburn is an import by Jon Robin Baitz originally written for the American Playhouse series on public television in America. It is a fine example of what television can give back to the theatre by enriching its style, and how theatre can take from television by adopting its acting techniques. There are two actors and three monologues: it makes compulsive viewing. The scale of the Tricycle Theatre supports detailed acting. Lindsay Duncan (GBH) and Peter Egan (Paradise Postponed) who play the married couple in Three Hotels are fine TV and film performers. The director Jack Gold is also much more famous in television. Remember the advice to Clint Eastwood: 'Don't just do something, stand there.' Everything is quiet and subtle. They deliver a pair of fine, focused performances. Their linked monologues have the same level quality as Alan Bennett's Talking Heads plays for TV in 1987. The plot settles in three hotels in Tangier, the Virgin Islands and Mexico. First, Ken Hoyle, Vice President of Iris &amp; Rose, baby formula producers, has jetted in to Tangier to redeploy the sales force: 'Fire 'em all and start from scratch.' He looks the part: the button-down shirt, grey suit and red striped tie make him the American Executive abroad, comfortable on the road: 'I came of age in hotels, I draw comfort from them.' But he has qualms about selling milk supplements in developing countries: 'How do you go to work every day when everyone disapproves?' In the second monologue, Ken's wife, Barbara has just addressed a meeting of company wives ('They like to be called girls', she confides) about expatriate life. Getting beyond pancake lessons for the maid, she speaks of her son's death in Brazil and of her husband's spiritual death: 'Be careful the company does not turn your husband into something unrecognisable.' Predictably, in the third monologue, Ken has been fired after Barbara's outburst to the company wives. But now he is in Mexico, that ideal alternative America everywhere from Carlos Fuentes to Paul Simon and James Taylor. It is Ken's honeymoon hotel, his wife has left him, and he is waiting for her to come back. Here it is easiest to believe that no one, looking back, wishes they had spent more time in the office. However, one cavil. The evening exposes a general problem with British actors using American accents. Another example was on show this week in another American two-hander, David Mamet's Oleanna (directed by Harold Pinter at the Oxford Playhouse). Accents seem to come either from Texas or Brooklyn. The America of Baitz and Mamet has escaped the ear of the dialect coaches. Tricycle Theatre, London, Until 25 September. Box Office 071-328-1000</p>

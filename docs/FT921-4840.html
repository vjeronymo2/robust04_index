			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: ASX returns to profit with ADollars 1.1m net THE Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) yesterday reported a net profit of ADollars 1.1m for the six months to December 31, Reuter reports from Sydney. It said higher revenue and a fall in expenditure had helped it return to profit from last year's loss of ADollars 4.1m. Revenue rose to ADollars 41.15 from ADollars 36.78m a year earlier while expenditure fell to ADollars 36.84m from ADollars 41.28m. The rise in revenue reflected increases from settlement fees, membership charges and listing and company fees, Mr Laurie Cox, chairman, said. The reduction in expenditure came from staff cuts and savings on equipment costs. The ASX said market capitalisation grew to ADollars 261bn during the period from ADollars 196bn a year earlier. It said the strength of the market was reflected in equity capital raisings which amounted to ADollars 5.5bn in the six months, up from ADollars 3bn. The largest capital raising was a partial float of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia which raised ADollars 1.3bn. A rights issue by the National Australia Bank raised ADollars 1bn. The ASX said 111 main board companies had been delisted in the six months but 17 had been listed.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [APS article: "May Day: Associations Join in a March Against </F> Terrorism"]    [Text] Professional trade unions and sociocultural  associations met yesterday at Press Headquarters in Algiers in  order to organize a national march against terrorism for May Day.    The chairman of the organizing committee, Mr. Mahmoudi,  stated that this national march would be one of "all workers and  citizens who are opposed to terrorism" and "are for civil  peace." The route for the march, it was said, goes from Martyrs  Square to May Day Square.    "Eighty-seven (87) associations have joined in this  initiative, which is of a nongovernmental, nonpartisan nature,"  said members of the organizing committee, which is made up of  the UFCA (Union of Algerian Financiers and Accountants), the AJA  (Association of Algerian Journalists), the AAA (Association of  Algerian Architects), the association of imams, the national  association of telecommunications engineers, the Association in  Memory of Mohamed Boudiaf, and the national coordinating board  of womens' associations. The organizing committee is also in  contact with the UGTA (General Union of Algerian Workers) so as  to link the main trade union organization with this initiative,  it was added.    Furthermore the committee anticipates launching an  international caravan including artists and cultural figures who  will give talks to make international opinion more aware of the  situation in Algeria, and in the future sponsoring charitable  events to bring in gifts to benefit families which have been  victims of terrorism.    The caravan will go, it is hoped, if sufficient means are  collected, to Brussels, Paris, Rome, Montreal, Washington, and  Tunis.    The committee will also speak with the ENTV and the ENRS  (television and radio) to organize a May Day telethon to assist  families that have been victims of terrorism.</p>

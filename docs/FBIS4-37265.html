			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by "an official source at the Defense </F> Ministry in the Democratic Republic of Yemen"; place and date  not given]    [Text] The city of Aden was subjected this evening to a  surface to surface missile attack. The forces of the military  regime ruling in Sanaa launched three surface to surface  missiles toward the capital city of Aden. Our air defense  systems confronted them and shot down two of them in mid-air  while the third missile fell into the sea.    This failed savage missiles attack on the city of Aden falls  within the framework of the flagrant defiance of the Arab and  international will by the military savage regime in Sanaa.    The Defense Ministry of the Democratic Republic of Yemen,  while still exercising self-restraint, will not stand with hands  tied amid the killing and destruction inflicted on our people by  the adventurous gang of Al al-Ahmar.</p>

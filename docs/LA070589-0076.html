			<p><P> July 5, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> British Gold Reserve Tapped: The British government used up 5% of Britain's  gold and foreign currency reserves last month in its attempt to prevent the  pound's weakness from turning into a full-scale sterling crisis. Figures  released by the British Treasury showed that the underlying level of the  reserves fell by $2.236 billion in June -- the biggest drop ever and an  indication of the scale of the Bank of England's intervention in the foreign  exchanges. With inflation already running at above 8%, the government was  forced to act, since a lower pound leads to more expensive imports and  eventually higher prices.  </P></p>

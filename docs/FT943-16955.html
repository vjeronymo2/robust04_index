			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / ABF reorganisation runs into Charity Commission hurdle The Charity Commission has intervened in the proposed reorganisation of Associated British Foods, the milling, baking and food products group, in a move that could scupper the plan. ABF said yesterday it had agreed with the commission that it would seek High Court guidance on whether it could proceed with its proposals, which were announced in May. The plan involves restructuring the highly complex ownership of ABF, which is held through a series of Weston family trusts and charitable foundations. The reorganisation is designed to improve the family's tax planning. ABF's minority shareholders would be offered equivalent shares in a newly quoted company and a 10p special dividend. Mr Garry Weston is chairman of ABF and about 40 members of the family work for the company. The Garfield Weston Foundation, ultimate controller of ABF, would have increased its indirect stake in the company from 36 to 40 per cent. ABF said it had sought legal and financial advice on the reorganisation. It had been told by its lawyers at Slaughter &amp; May and Herbert Smith that there was no need to seek approval from the courts or the Charity Commission. The commission confirmed yesterday that it had spotted the proposed reorganisation and raised the matter with the trustees as part of a more active approach to monitoring charities. It has questioned whether approval of the proposals would be 'expedient in the interests of' the foundation. The phrase refers to trustee law dating back as far as 1925. 'We have so far not been able to satisfy ourselves on this and have agreed that the matter should be resolved by the court as the trustees have requested,' the Commission said. ABF must first seek formal approval from the commission to go to the High Court, and then make an application to the court to resolve the legal principle. It said the foundation's trustees were 'confident of their position'.</p>

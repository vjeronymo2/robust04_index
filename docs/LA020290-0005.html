			<p><P> February 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SECORD GETS PROBATION  </P> <P> That my fellow Air Commando Assn. member Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord opted to  cop a plea rather than stand and fight as did Lt. Col. Oliver L. North is  regrettable ("Secord Gets Probation, Calls Reagan Cowardly," Part A, Jan. 25).  The Iran-Contra affair ("scandal" as The Times persists on calling it), was no  more than a witch hunt conducted by congressional Democrats ably abetted by the  news media with the intent to smear and, if possible, impeach President Ronald  Reagan.  </P> <P> To this extent, the congressional Democrats and the media failed because Reagan  never admitted to any knowledge of providing weapons to Iran to achieve the  release of our hostages, nor any knowledge of the use of the money gained from  the sale of arms to Iran to be passed on to the Nicaraguan Freedom Fighters.  Unless former President Reagan's classified papers and/or tapes are made  available to the defense counsels, or if the former President himself is not  called to the witness stand to testify under oath, it will never be known just  how much Reagan knew and when he knew it and if he did not sanction this  operation. That is why I deeply regret that Secord did not stand and fight  instead of copping a plea and prostrating himself before the court in  contrition. This is not how a man fights injustice.  </P> <P> Men and women who engage in covert operations on behalf of their government,  especially when they believe that such operations have been ordered by the  commander in chief, are obligated to keep the secrets even if this means lying  to persons who do not possess the need to know. This is particularly true when  they are hauled before a congressional panel determined to subvert the  President's constitutional prerogative of conducting the foreign policy of the  U.S.  </P> <P> With this in mind, Secord should have challenged the allegations made against  him just as did North and, I would hope, Admiral John Poindexter.  </P> <P> Because constitutional questions are involved, I believe that it is necessary  that the findings of the lower courts be challenged to the Supreme Court and  that President Reagan (and his wife) be ordered to testify and to produce any  and all documents and tapes that bear upon this case.  </P> <P> EDWIN O. LEARNARD  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

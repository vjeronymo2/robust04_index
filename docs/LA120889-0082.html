			<p><P> December 8, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STUART KARL BACK IN HOME VIDEO AFTER BANKRUPTCY  </P> <P> Video entrepreneur Stuart Karl, who achieved fame and fortune with the Jane  Fonda workout tapes and then suffered a series of reversals including a felony  conviction and bankruptcy, has returned to the video business as president of a  fledgling Los Angeles production company.  </P> <P> Karl was named president of NAC Home Video, a unit of the closely held  television production and record company Gold 'N M Communications. Gold 'N M  Chairman Michael E. Marcovsky, himself a successful television and cellular  telephone entrepreneur, said he hired Karl because of his "tremendous track  record," referring to him as "Mr. Home Video."  </P> <P> Karl, who has been a consultant for NAC for several months, will head the  company's non-movie production efforts, such as a home videocassette of  Thursday night's Sugar Ray Leonard-Roberto Duran prizefight.  </P> <P> Marcovsky said he was unperturbed by Karl's ongoing legal and financial  difficulties. Karl pleaded guilty last year to making $185,000 in illegal  contributions to the political campaigns of presidential candidate Gary Hart  and six congressmen, and was sentenced to three years probation and fined  $60,000.  </P> <P> In July, Karl filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, just as the Internal  Revenue Service was preparing to auction off his 15,000-square-foot Newport  Beach home for non-payment of $717,701 in federal taxes. Karl listed $3.9  million in debts in the bankruptcy petition and no income or significant assets  other than the home.  </P> <P> Documents in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Santa Ana indicate that the Chapter 11  petition, which protects a debtor from creditors while a repayment plan is  being worked out, was converted to Chapter 7 bankruptcy last month. Chapter 7  normally requires liquidation of assets to repay creditors, and the court has  given permission for the home to be put on the market for $1.75 million.  </P> <P> Neither Karl nor his bankruptcy attorney could be reached for comment.  </P> <P> Karl, 37, achieved his first business success with a collection of trade  magazines and then achieved a spectacular coup in the budding home video  business in 1984 when he persuaded Jane Fonda to record her workouts for sale  on videocassette. The Fonda tapes were considered a landmark product in the  then-undeveloped home video market, and they remain the best-selling non-movie  tapes ever made. JONATHAN WEBER  </P></p>

			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / Nadir adviser proves a friend in deed: Andrew Jack talks to the PR man who canvassed politicians on behalf of the ex-Polly Peck chief THE MAN at the centre of the row over the political intervention by senior Conservative MPs in connection with Mr Asil Nadir said yesterday he would continue to work for the fugitive businessman. Mr Christopher Morgan, head of the public relations firm Morgan &amp; Rogerson, said: 'I'm not giving up.' He refused to make judgments about Mr Nadir's guilt and stressed the issue of Mr Nadir's treatment by the Serious Fraud Office. He said he started working for him because 'I didn't think there was a flat playing field'. Mr Morgan was at Mr Nadir's side when he gave his first conference in northern Cyprus after jumping bail last month. Yet Mr Morgan insists he has never been paid by Mr Nadir, who has been bankrupt throughout their business relationship. 'We were just doing a job. What remuneration was quite irrelevant,' he said. Questions have been raised about Mr Morgan's credibility, but he denied suggestions that he had misled newspapers over his attempts to involve Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, in the Nadir case. His partner Mr Mark Rogerson was the constituent who nominally made contact with Mr Michael Mates, the Northern Ireland minister, but it is Mr Morgan who best knows Mr Mates. Several years ago Mr Mates hosted a 50th birthday party for Mr Morgan at the Commons. As well as contacting ministers, Mr Morgan has been in contact with BBC Television's Panorama programme, which has been preparing a story on Mr Nadir over several months. Mr Harry Dean, one of the series' two deputy editors and the one responsible for the programme, said last night: 'We are still very actively considering broadcasting it.' Mr Morgan is the person most involved in contacting MPs on Mr Nadir's behalf. He contacted Mr Peter Brooke, national heritage secretary, as Mr Nadir's constituency MP, and claims to have known Mr Heseltine socially for several years. He said he spoke to him in an 'informal and confidential' meeting. Mr Morgan said he raised the concerns of Mr Nadir's legal advisers about the administration of his case by the Serious Fraud Office. Mr Morgan said he had met Mr Nadir 'fleetingly' over several years but only started working for him in the past two after referral from a mutual friend. He said he liked Mr Nadir personally and added: 'I would have been intrigued to have been his PR adviser before the crash (of Polly Peck).' Like Mr Nadir, Mr Morgan has led a colourful and somewhat cosmopolitan life. He speaks French and lives in Vaucluse in the Provence countryside. He commutes to London where he stays at the Reform Club. Mr Morgan is also a regular visitor to Spain, and says he has often attended the bull-racing festival at Pamplona. Yesterday he did not want to name other current clients or to provide details of his firm. Morgan &amp; Rogerson has existed for about a year and focuses on financially oriented marketing and public relations. Mr Morgan has carried out some exotic contracts in the past. He said his past clients had included the Spanish government - for which he promoted Rioja wine in the UK - and Cuba Tobacco, for which he promoted the Havana cigar in this country. One of his more high-profile cases was as an adviser to Lloyds Merchant Bank in connection with the Westland helicopter affair, the time at which he met Mr Heseltine. He worked as an adviser to the London International Financial Futures Exchange, the Chicago Board of Trade and the French Bond Market. More recently he worked with the consortium bidding for the Olympic Games to be held in Manchester in the year 2000.</p>

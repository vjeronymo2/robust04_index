			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> The New York state Board of Parole said Bernhard H. Goetz must serve the full  one-year prison sentence he got for illegally carrying the gun he used to shoot  four teen-agers on a New York City subway in 1984. Releasing Goetz after just  two months in jail "would deprecate the seriousness of the crime and undermine  respect for the law," the board said in Albany. Monday was the earliest Goetz  could have been released. Edward Elwin, the board's executive director, said  the decision meant Goetz would have to serve his full one-year sentence, minus  any time off for good behavior, unless he can persuade a court to overturn the  board's ruling. Goetz, 41, was convicted on the gun charge but acquitted of  attempted murder, assault and reckless endangerment charges. He began serving  his sentence Jan. 13 .  </P></p>

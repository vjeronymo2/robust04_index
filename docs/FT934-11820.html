			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / People: RTZ's Australian swap shop The question of whether RTZ Corporation, the UK-based biggest mining company in the world, controls CRA, one of Australia's leading natural resources groups in which it has a 49 per cent stake, is a touchy subject, particularly in Australia. Nevertheless, there is an increasing movement of senior executives between the two. The latest involves Leigh Clifford who will join RTZ on secondment from CRA as an executive director in May next year. At CRA, Clifford, a 46-year-old mining engineer, is responsible for the group's investments in energy, including the coal operations and the most recent acquisition, Coal and Allied. RTZ has so far this year spent a net Dollars 480m on buying coal assets in the US and says it has ambitions to acquire more; with Clifford on the board it is likely that this strategy would be vigorously pursued. Clifford is a graduate of Melbourne University and has been with CRA since 1970. Until his 1988 appointment as a group executive, he worked principally in the lead/zinc operations. His arrival at RTZ coincides with the return to CRA of Leon Davis who has been on secondment to the UK company's board. His main task was to reorganise the combined worldwide exploration activities after RTZ bought most of British Petroleum's mining and metals assets for Dollars 3.7bn in 1989. Davis returns next May as CRA's managing director and chief executive designate.</p>

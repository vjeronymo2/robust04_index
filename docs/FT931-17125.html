			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / Concern raised over South Georgia deal A REPORT to the cabinet raised concerns that a whaling deal could lead to the south Atlantic island of South Georgia becoming populated entirely by Japanese. The government felt it could not interfere in a commercial transaction. Housing was becoming a 'lively political issue' because of a shortage of private rented homes and high interest rates. Mr Rab Butler, the home secretary, warned of the risk of a 'big explosion' of racial conflict if the government was not seen to take action after a series of fascist meetings were broken up violently. Rapid growth of office employment worried the home secretary. He feared the concentration of offices in inner cities could lead to land shortages, increased homelessness, traffic congestion and high travel costs.</p>

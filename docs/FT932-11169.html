			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / Survey of Bulgaria (14): Tobacco industry seeks greater incentives BULGARIAN tobacco industry executives want the government to offer better incentives to newly privatised producers and potential foreign investors to revive what is traditionally one of the country's best earners, writes Theodor Troev. International tobacco companies Rothmans and Reynolds have indicated their readiness to invest heavily in Bulgaria. However, Bulgarian tobacco growers face short-term difficulties if agrarian reform does not stimulate production from fields that have newly been returned to private owners. Last year, production was only half what it was in the early 1980s when Bulgaria was thebiggest tobacco producer in Europe with a 19 per cent market share and was the world's seventh largest producer. Now the country produces only 10 per cent of Europe's tobacco, and ranks 14th in the world. Bulgartabac, the state-owned tobacco monopoly, was once the world's biggest exporter of cigarettes and the second largest tobacco exporter. Tobacco and cigarettes accounted for half of Bulgaria's exported processed agricultural products. But the US overtook Bulgaria in the 1980s and now exports more than twice as much tobacco. The loss of former Soviet and Comecon markets in recent years has crippled export sales. Bulgar- tabac's exports to the CIS last year were only 76 per cent of those to the Soviet Union in 1991. Exports to Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia also fell after customs duties went up to protect their industries. Bulgartabac officials complain that the Bulgarian government did just the opposite last year when it cut customs duties from 80 to 40 per cent. As a result cigarette imports rose to 6.5m kg in 1992, equal to the annual production of 10,000 Bulgarian farmers, according to the Union of Tobacco Producers. Meanwhile, farmers complain that the prices paid for their tobacco by the state monopoly cover under 70 per cent of production costs. The UTP claims that, given the incentive of higher prices, tobacco production could leap to 100m kg. As it is, Bulgaria's 12 tobacco-processing plants and nine cigarette-producing factories operated at only 60 per cent of capacity last year.</p>

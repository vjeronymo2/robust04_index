			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa has stated that the  situation in Yemen is regrettable. He added that no good will  come of the military action, either in the near or distant  future. He noted that the situation of Yemen is still on the  agenda of the Arab League, adding that the Arab League Council's  emergency session is still in session. Everybody, he said, is  following the developments and events there.    Regarding the Syrian-Israeli peace track, the foreign  minister said that diplomatic action will continue in the coming  days to narrow the differences between Syria and Israel. He  pointed out that U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's  talks in Cairo showed that differences do exist between the two  sides. The talks also showed the feasibility of continuing  efforts to bridge the gap as much as possible, he added.    Answering a question on Egypt's stand on the situation in  Somalia, Musa said that Egypt is ready to intervene once again  to reconcile the parties in Somalia in view of Egypt's status,  role, and connections in consolidating unity in Somalia.    [Cairo MENA in Arabic at 1445 GMT on 19 May carries a  further  report on Musa's statement, which adds:    ["Asked about the disagreement between the Palestinians and  Israelis over Palestinian president Yasir 'Arafat's remarks in  Johannesburg in which he called for a jihad for the sake of  Jerusalem, Musa said: There are many statements from both  sides. The important thing, he added, is for these statements  to serve what has been achieved and prepare the ground for the  coming stages of negotiations between the two sides. He  stressed that the Palestinian efforts, which we are all behind,  must be directed toward giving momentum to a fruitful  negotiation process to restore full Palestinian rights as part  of the land for peace principle."]</p>

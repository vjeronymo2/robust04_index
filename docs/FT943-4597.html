			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / Government to survey industry on research The Cabinet Office will start this week to send 8,000 detailed questionnaires to industrialists, scientists and engineers. It is the next stage of Technology Foresight, the government's programme to draw up research priorities for the next 10 to 20 years. Each of the 15 Technology Foresight panels has drawn up a questionnaire for its industrial sector, asking about 80 questions covering the market opportunities that will be most important to the UK and the scientific and technological advances that will underpin them. The financial services questionnaire asks for opinions about statements ranging from 'DNA identification is socially acceptable as a universal authenticator of transactions' to 'computer programs regularly outperform human managers in portfolio management'. The questionnaire is the first stage of the survey. The second stage, starting in November, will give respondents the opportunity to revise their views in the light of opinions expressed in the first phase. Sir William Stewart, the government's chief scientist, told the British Association that the findings from the questionnaires, with the results of autumn regional workshops around Britain, 'will be drawn together to guide long-term priorities for government-funded science and for research and development in the private sector.' The ultimate purpose of Technology Foresight, Sir William said, was 'about developing a longer-term vision. The vision should not be developed by bureaucrats . . . it has to be developed by the scientific community, by academia, marketing people'. Sir William reassured academic researchers that 'we cannot leave our scientific infrastructure solely to the market'.</p>

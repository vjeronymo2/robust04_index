			<p><P> July 9, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GOLF RANGE VS. THE GROWING NEEDS OF ONE COMMUNITY  </P> <P> After reading the article on the successful, productive community gardens at  Leisure World (June 26), a letter regarding the organic community garden at  Golden West College is in order. Golden West's garden has been in existence for  over 10 years. During the last six months, the gardeners at the college have  been actively working toward the preservation of this community amenity.  </P> <P> In December, 1988, we were sent a letter that the garden was to be closed as  early as June but by Sept. 1, 1989, for certain. They were only allowing those  enrolled in the fall 1988 semester to continue until the closure. This was the  first any of us knew of the plan. Golden West College officials would like to  see the area converted into a golf driving range. There already exist three  golf driving ranges within five miles of Golden West College. In an even larger  area, there exist no community gardens.  </P> <P> I believe that the college deviates from its mission when it additionally  suggests that not only will it develop a golf driving range, but is also  considering apartment buildings or a commercial center at the southwest corner  of the campus. What is happening to the community college system? Aren't these  campuses sacred from the overwhelming need to cover every inch of open space  with concrete structures? Similar proposals have been initiated by Orange Coast  College in Costa Mesa.  </P> <P> At the heart of the matter, as the June 26 article reiterated, is the fact that  the community gardening is beneficial in many ways to those who participate.  Participants who have no other place to garden gain exercise, healthy fruits  and vegetables, opportunities to socialize that may not be available otherwise  and general mental renewal from the act of gardening. Time after time the  National Gardening Assn. surveys find that gardening is the most popular  leisure-time activity.  </P> <P> Our immediate goal has been to reopen the garden to everyone on a  semester-by-semester basis, to use the garden to the fullest until this  development plan is actually formulated. As of this writing, the college is  uncertain about how it will develop the campus, however it refuses to reopen  the garden to everyone. It will allow the few who were not scared off by the  closure letter to remain but will not let others partake in this renewing,  ever-popular activity.  </P> <P> I thought community colleges had a responsibility to serve the needs in their  community. I am disappointed in the lack of the community college district to  address the full range of community needs. Without forward-thinking planning  for the whole community, urban life will continue to produce symptoms which are  even more expensive to repair than the buildings at Golden West College, which  is the cited motivation for these development plans.  </P> <P> SUZANNE F.

			<p><P> February 18, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> SWEETNESS GETS A BIT GOOEY IN LOVELAND  </P> <P> This town, known as Colorado's Sweetheart City, had a little more sweetness  than it could handle Friday.  </P> <P> A molasses storage tank sprang a leak before dawn, spilling its gooey contents  onto city streets and an industrial park.  </P> <P> The molasses, stiffened by near-zero temperatures, flowed slowly and more than  a foot deep about one-half mile down a city street. City officials estimated  that about 100,000 gallons spilled from the tank, which was at an old sugar  factory.  </P></p>

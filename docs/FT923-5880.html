			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading TRADING IN the futures market moved to a quieter pitch as the spotlight turned away from sterling and on to more technical issues, writes Christopher Price. The FT-SE contract for September delivery opened firmer at 2,310 and immediately started a slow climb as optimism pervaded the market. A bright overnight Wall Street and sparkling Tokyo performance provided the impetus, and the feeling that the falls of the last few days had been overdone helped the momentum. Among the houses reported to be busy in the market was Goldman Sachs, said to have been a big buyer in early morning trading. September's move forward accelerated around midday with a spurious story that Germany had cut its interest rates, sending the contract to a high for the day of 2,334. Buyer interest faded during the latter part of the session, and sentiment was not helped by a rumour that Italian rates had been put up. September closed at 2,318, up 26 on the day and about a point above fair value of around 5.5. Volume came to 9,449 lots. Dealings also slackened in the traded options market. BTR was the top traded stock option with 2,427 contracts dealt out of a total of 24,801.</p>

			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Probe of Mexican group widened The office of Mexico's attorney-general has widened its investigation into Grupo Financiero Havre, a financial services group in Mexico City, for alleged embezzlement of more than Dollars 100m (Pounds 65m) from state development banks. The government alleges that Havre set up more than 70 phantom companies which illegally borrowed more than Dollars 100m (some in pesos, some in foreign exchange) from Nafinsa and Bancomext, two state development banks. The money was alleged to have been diverted into other companies owned by the family of Mr Julio Mariscal, the Havre chairman. He is one of Mexico's most prominent businessmen. In addition to controlling Havre, he owns the Mexican concession to sell General Motors cars. In 1992, Mr Mariscal bought the brokerage Casa de Bolsa Mexico for about Dollars 60m. Havre is Mexico's 18th largest financial services group, with insurance, brokerage, factoring and leasing subsidiaries. Government officials have now assumed supervision of the group. Last month, Havre's insurance arm was accused by the finance ministry and the national banking commission, a regulatory body, of failing to report financial information, of alteration of financial records and over-reporting its level of capitalisation. The attorney-general is taking legal action against at least 24 Havre executives, including Mr Mariscal, his son, the company's top legal officer, Mr Ricardo Nevarez, the vice-chairman of the insurance arm, Mr Jose Antonio Aguilar, and the company's entire board of directors. Mr Mariscal is reported to be in hospital in the US, with proceedings under way to extradite him to Mexico, while Mr Nevarez has is reported as having disappeared.</p>

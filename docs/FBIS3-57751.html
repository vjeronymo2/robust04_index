			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Nikita Yermakov and Konstantin </F> Pribytkov]    [Text] Davos (Switzerland), 30 Jan -- All the talk about a  change in the reform course in Russia is premature, and in the  West it is also too emotional, Dmitriy Ryurikov, the Russian  Federation president's adviser on international affairs, told an  ITAR-TASS correspondent; Ryurikov is taking part in the World  Economic Forum under way here.    "I believe that some statesmen and journalists in the West  should deal more with facts and figures, and be more sober and  more pragmatic," he said. "The budget has not been announced,  nor has the government's program, even the composition of the  government has not been finalized, and on the whole it contains  the same people. There have been assurances from the president  and there have been assurances from the prime minister. What  else do you need?"    Ryurikov believes that the main foreign aid to Russia would  be the opening of markets to Russian goods. The effectiveness  of such a measure was evident last year. If this tendency  continues that will be the best aid. As to assistance from  international financial bodies, it should be directed at support  for specific projects, preferably unconnected with government  structures, and, preferably, in the regions.    Russia had and has its place in the world economy, said the  president's adviser said. I think that now it must make this  place more advantageous, and, by changing itself, change its  stand in the world. Precisely this will be the subject at all  the talks related to Russia's participation in the Naples G-7  meeting.    Dmitriy Ryurikov considers that the discussions at the Davos  forum, in which heads of states, leaders of world business and  eminent scientists are participating, are useful. According to  him, the forum is useful, it allows to detect the mood of  business people and foreign government circles in respect to  Russia, permits to find out what interests them in our country.  And, in turn, it gives us the opportunity to voice our  questions, to talk about our concerns.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Pedro Paris Montesinos, president of </F> Venezuela's Democratic Action, AD, by Carlos Fernandez, host of  the program "24 Hours," at the network's studio in Caracas --  live]    [Text] [Fernandez] Yesterday, we learned of the general  guidelines of the economic strategy President Rafael Caldera's  government will apparently adopt. Initiatives that will dictate  the government's actions in the next five years were outlined.  That will be the first topic up for discussion with AD President  Dr. Pedro Paris Montesinos. What is your initial opinion about  what was learned yesterday and the promulgation of the law on  concessions to which the Venezuelan president gave great  importance and relevance? We welcome Dr. Pedro Paris Montesinos,  and let us hear his opinion about this and many other topics.    [Paris] Thank you, Carlos. I am very pleased to be back on  your program after being away for several months. We are here,  and, as usual, we are prepared to answer your questions, which  are always intelligently formulated, in fact, we briefly  reviewed, on the government's behalf, the preliminary ideas  outlined by Dr. Berend Roosen [chairman of the National Council  for Commerce and Services] concerning a logical plan to resolve  the country's prevailing financial crisis. We asked a party  technical committee to make a thorough, reflective, and  objective analysis of these proposals so we may officially issue  our opinion on this matter. The committee is working, and I  believe the CEN [National Executive Council] will receive a  report from its members next week.    I believe it is timely and advisable for the government to  define a coherent line of action, and I have said this to the  media. We should have no contradictions on the decisions we  adopt, because--far from helping to create confidence and  dispelling the prevailing doubts and confusion among the  Venezuelan people about this and other issues--we believe it  would be positive to define all this.    [Fernandez] We might say some steps are being taken: the  overall tax reforms and the Congress-approved laws the president  of the Republic must now promulgate.    [Paris] Exactly. It was....    [Fernandez, interrupting] Also, what the economy minister  announced yesterday.    [Paris] Exactly. It was an AD initiative, meaning, to  propose  in Congress that the president of the Republic be given special  powers so he could adopt emergency economic measures. This was  defined through the government's own plan, and the government  should issue those laws within this period, which is relatively  brief, 30 days.    I was quite pleased to witness the signing of the document  for the promulgation of the decree on concessions. It is quite  thorough, and its outlook is very positive. The Concessions Law  that was issued in the past and was still in effect mostly  granted concessions on finished works, meaning, to manage what  was already built rather than to build them, which is what the  goal sought by a true concessions law should be.    I think the government's guidelines show it is fully aware  of  the country's needs. Because it lacks the resources to build  these large-scale works on its own, it can facilitate things so  they are built through concessions. For example, I have  information the national railroad plan, which has an  extraordinary outlook for the country's economic and social  sectors, has received offers from qualified enterprises in the  country and abroad to build different portions of the railroad  in various regions of the country; in other words, they consider  this as a very good opportunity to invest and make a good deal,  not to mention the fact this would give the country what it has  needed for more than 100 years--a railroad network.    [Fernandez] That is a good example of how the Concessions  Law  can be fully implemented. You talked about the need for harmony,  the need to maintain firm, coherent criteria concerning the  government's economic strategy to prevent contradictions in the  future. This happened to Carlos Perez's government, whose  ministerial team worked on its own and provoked contradictions  with AD's sensibility and perception. I do not think the same  thing will happen with the Caldera administration. There is a  consensus within the National Convergence on its democratic  actions, and the same goes for MAS [Movement Toward Socialism];  nevertheless, what is your opinion on a possible negotiation  with Congress?    [Paris] Those negotiations would be difficult no matter how  much goodwill to fully cooperate there is at Congress, as I  believe there is. Negotiations would not be easy because  political issues will, naturally, play a decisive role, and this  somehow exerts an influence on any decision that may be adopted.    Pertaining to the AD, we have decided to follow a strategy  which, although we will continue to oppose President Caldera's  government, will allow the development of plans that benefit the  country because we have always believed national interests are  more important than the political interests of any party,  institution, or group which would try to interfere in our  economic and social development. We have said we are an  opposition party, and we are proving that very objectively but  very seriously. I believe Venezuela's situation is in no  condition to be playing negative, petty politics that deny all  the values....    [Fernandez, interrupting] That is very important because one  of the most fundamental issues now is the stabilization of the  Venezuelan economy. By achieving good economic stability, we  will obviously have political stability.    [Paris] Yes, if we do not resolve the country's economic  situation, I believe the stability of the democratic system and  the survival of democracy are in serious danger.    [Fernandez] AD is very clear on this issue and is willing to  cooperate, of course, without losing its political or  ideological principles or future electoral interests.    [Paris] Yes. I believe the party's leadership is aware of  what we have on our hands. We know that if we do not act  seriously and responsibly we run a very serious risk, including  our party's survival, because the first decision a de facto  government would make would be to disband all parties, as has  always been the case. I do not believe there are any military  coups that do not result in cruel dictatorships as has occurred  in the past and worldwide.  [Fernandez] Now that you are mentioning the electoral issue,  elections were held recently in April. Elections were held in  Lara State on 10 April, and there were also elections on 24  April. The results were favorable for AD, thus ratifying  confidence, either partial or whatever, in the party handling  administrative chores. That did not occur in the mayoral race in  San Cristobal, but that is another matter and another situation.  How does your party feel about these victories?    [Paris] First, we regret we had to repeat an electoral  process that AD had won in 1992. Due to things that occur in  Venezuelan politics, the Supreme Court annulled the elections in  Nueva Esparta and Lara and forced us to go through the process.  We proved once again the AD is still a strong political force  that will not disappear. No one can make it disappear because it  is a result of a reality in this country. AD is a feeling that  has been ingrained in the Venezuelan people for many years,  since its founding. Be that as it may, despite so many attacks  on AD and the errors AD has committed in various opportunities  in the government, despite all these facts that might look  negative, the result AD presents to the Venezuelan people is  always positive.    [Fernandez] It is also important for an internal change to  take place, not within the parameters of mere rhetoric, but,  rather, a real change, because the victory in Lara, or Nueva  Esparta, or any other victory merely as a result of a political  situation does not mean AD is experiencing a new high or  anything like that.    [Paris] We are definitely experiencing our best moment as a  party, and we are suffering the results of so many things that  have recently occurred and that in some way have undoubtedly  affected AD's prestige and good image. We need to solve our  problems. We have internal problems, and it would be silly to  deny it, and these problems cannot be solved through shady deals  or settlements.    I believe it is necessary to let the party rank and file  state its views very clearly, very cleanly, without any  interference, as to what it wants to do with AD, in what  direction AD should go. I think it is advisable to carry out an  ideological renewal, a revision of what we have done for the  country, what we have done wrong and what we have done right, to  gain the necessary experience that will allow us to redefine the  party's future actions, as I believe we are going to, because  internal elections should be held this year.    [Fernandez] Precisely. There are questions from our  television viewers in Caricuao and Tucupido, Guarico State, who  called our telephone numbers 793-1845 and 793-1634 to comment on  this issue; that is, internal elections.    [Paris] I do not believe anyone in the party would dare  propose at this time that we postpone the elections forever.  They must be held this year because this term of the board of  directors ends in November. The party's secretary general, Mr.  Luis Alfaro, has said he wants to feel the satisfaction of  having the party renew itself, change its board of directors for  the first time when the board's term is up. Hopefully this will  be carried out in....    [Fernandez, interrupting] Claudio Fermin has already  announced his plans.    [Paris] Claudio Fermin has already announced his plans,  rightfully so, and other candidates may possibly arise. Other  candidates may convince the rank and file of the need to change  the party so it may truly become an instrument of change.    I think we have to organize the party's activities at the  municipal level because it is from there, from the rank and  file, from the local committees, from the Venezuelan  neighborhoods and rural homes, where a movement for AD's renewal  and change can arise. I sincerely believe in this and hope we do  it this year to the satisfaction of the many party activists who  are demanding it and who will not allow any further postponement  of this issue.</p>

			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NORTHROP TO SELL CENTURY CITY OFFICES TO REDUCE ITS DEBT  </P> <P> Northrop Corp., whose value on the New York Stock Exchange has tumbled below  that of the real estate it owns, plans to sell its tony headquarters complex in  Century City, company officials said.  </P> <P> "In order to reduce our debt, we're actively looking at the sale of our  non-operating assets," spokesman Tony Cantafio said in an interview published  today.  </P> <P> Northrop is not the first aerospace company to try to cash in on real estate  recently as prospects for defense work have dimmed. Last month, F-14 maker  Grumman Corp. said it would redevelop nearly half its 500-acre headquarters on  Long Island, N.Y., with a hotel, shopping center and offices.  </P> <P> Northrop sent information packages to 10 prospective buyers on its two Century  Park East buildings about a month ago, asking $247.5 million for them, Mike  DeSantis, a vice president of the Cushman &amp; Wakefield real estate  brokerage, was quoted by Copley Los Angeles Newspapers as saying.  </P> <P> However, DeSantis said today that he had never estimated a price for the  buildings.  </P></p>

			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / US Mid-term Elections - November 8: California's immigration campaign tests its strength - A ballot proposing a crackdown on illegal immigrants leaves even conservatives uncomfortable The motorist heading south towards the Mexican border blinks twice and slows down to make sure the eyes are not playing tricks. But a few hundred yards on there is another one and then another. It is a road sign, all right, but very different from the familiar walking stick figure that warns of frequent pedestrian crossings. Instead, there are three figures, a man, a woman and a child, bent low and running. It is a road sign which, in theory, would be made redundant if Proposition 187 is approved by the voters of California on November 8, as all the polls now suggest it will. For this measure, known by its proponents as 'save our state', is explicitly designed not merely to discourage illegal newcomers but expose those already here. The proposition would render 'undocumented aliens' ineligible for state education and non-emergency health care. It would also require schools and hospitals to check in advance the immigration status of those seeking education or hospital treatment and to report to the state each case in which even 'suspected' illegal residence exists. The California initiative process - whereby citizens can initiate a state referendum on particular issues - frequently produces controversy and sometimes sets national trends. In 1978, Proposition 13, which passed, cut property taxes deeply, setting the stage for the Reagan administration; in 1990 the environmental movement finally overreached itself with its 'big green' initiative, which lost. Proposition 187 is of potentially comparable importance on several counts, including US relations with its southern neighbour. Mexico's foreign ministry last month complained of 'racist and xenophobic' overtones in the California debate and warned that the improvement in commercial and economic relations brought about by the North American free trade agreement could be at risk. But its most immediate impact is domestic. Politically, it is yet another test of the strength of the resurgent and populist 'America first' movement, fed up to the back teeth with almost everything, especially government, and looking for scapegoats, of which the foreign-born almost everywhere have been a tempting target. It has become a cause fanned by rightwing talk show hosts and hitherto obscure organisations like the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), whose larger goal often appears to be to keep out everybody. Some conservatives, however, are rendered uncomfortable. This week Mr Jack Kemp and Mr Bill Bennett, formerly in the Bush cabinet, condemned the proposition's 'constitutionally questionable solutions which are not consonant with our history'. In California, it pits the federal government, which opposes it, against Governor Pete Wilson, the moderate Republican who, yet again, has shifted to the right in an election campaign. His support for it, initially reluctant but now full-throated, has clearly helped his surge to the front against Ms Kathleen Brown, his Democrat opponent. Yet Mr Wilson's strongest constituency, the state business and professional establishment, is openly nervous about the proposition's consequences. Typical was an editorial in the conservative Union-Tribune of San Diego, whose city supervisors last month voted 'an immigrant state of emergency'. It concluded: 'Before buying into its false promises, voters should take a good look at the fine print.' These fears may derive from self-interest, since Californian business, notably agriculture, has long relied on immigrant labour and has often not been too particular about documentation. But the fine print was carefully examined this summer in a report from the office of the legislative analyst in Sacramento, a non-partisan state agency. It calculated that more than Dollars 15bn a year of federal health and education funding to California would be put at risk because of Proposition 187's violation of federal laws. This far exceeded estimated annual savings of a mere Dollars 200m from reduced public services and even this was partly offset by the extra cost of verifying residency status, put at 'at least Dollars 100m' in the first year and 'tens of millions' thereafter, primarily chargeable to the counties and school districts least able to bear it. The legal problems are not to be dismissed. A 1982 Supreme Court ruling requires states to admit the children of illegal immigrants to public (state) schools under the equal protection amendment to the constitution. Also, an act of congress orders the severance of federal funds to any school disclosing confidential information without written parental consent. The latest salvo against the proposition has come from the medical profession. A study published on Tuesday by the University of Southern California saw a real risk to the general population from the spread of communicable diseases, such as tuberculosis, syphilis and Aids, if fear of being reported deters illegal immigrants from seeking medical treatment. But expert and moral opinion cannot hide under the rug the real and perceived problem of illegal immigration, especially in California. The Immigration and Naturalisation Service estimated in April that there were about 1.6m illegal immigrants in the state, a third of whom had simply outstayed their tourist and student visas, and that 125,000 more were arriving each year, mostly from Mexico. These numbers would have been nothing when California's economic horizons were limitless, but the state is only now emerging haltingly from the deepest recession in 60 years. The popular perception, shared, according to polls, by 50 per cent of legal Hispanic residents, is that scarce resources are being spent on those who have no right to be here in the first place. Mr Wilson claims that nearly a tenth (about Dollars 3bn) of the state budget is now eaten up by the costs of providing healthcare to illegal immigrants and of educating their 300,000 children. This is why, along with the governors of Florida and Texas, both also up for re-election, he is suing Washington to foot the bill. But he concedes that the constitutionality of Proposition 187, assuming it passes, is bound to be tested in the courts. There are, of course, other approaches to the problem, including tighter policing of the border, reinforced again in the past month, and tougher penalties on companies who knowingly hire illegal immigrants. In August a federal advisory commission went so far as to recommend a national computerised employment registry to verify the status of immigrant job applicants, but was given short shrift by the Clinton administration. But Proposition 187 offers the public a first crack at the issue. Ironically, it all began when Mr Ron Prince, a southern Californian accountant, was enraged after being defrauded by a builder who was an illegal immigrant. His movement caught fire but somehow lost in the smoke was one simple fact. The contractor was a Canadian.</p>

			<p><P> November 22, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MATTER OF BELIEFS  </P> <P> On the front page (Nov.17) were the following two headlines: "Six Jesuit  Priests Slain in Salvador" and "Pro-Choice Lawmaker Is Barred From Church  Rite." I'm sure I'm not the only person to notice the incredible irony of the  situation.  </P> <P> On one hand, we see dedicated Jesuit priests willing to die for their beliefs,  one of which is their concept of freedom. On the other hand, we have a priest  withholding a sacrament because an elected official has used her freedom to  disagree with the church. What's wrong with this picture?  </P> <P> KATHYRN J.

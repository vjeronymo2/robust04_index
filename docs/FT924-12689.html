			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Big rise in Russian minimum wage likely THE Russian finance ministry is planning to more than double the minimum monthly wage from the start of next year, Itar-Tass news agency said yesterday, Reuter reports. The agency, quoting what it said was a well-informed source, said the ministry would soon propose the minimum wage be increased from Rbs900 (Pounds 1.54) to Rbs2,250, at an extra cost of Rbs230bn a month. This will worsen the budget deficit, set to hit Rbs950bn this year.</p>

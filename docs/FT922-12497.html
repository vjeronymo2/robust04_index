			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / Brussels warns on Greek economy THE European Commission has issued a strong warning on the problems of the deficit-plagued Greek economy, and called for new revenue-raising measures to be implemented immediately. A confidential Commission report proposes the introduction of two economic packages to raise Dr1,000bn (Pounds 2.9bn) in extra income by the end of 1993. This would offset projected losses resulting from income tax reform and deferred interest payments on the rapidly growing public debt. The economy ministry took the unusual step of making the report available to journalists, in what appeared to be an effort to heighten Greeks' awareness of their economic predicament. The report said that if Greece was to participate in European monetary union, 'a very substantial, vigorous and effective adjustment package is needed immediately, and must be followed by further continuous and sustained measures'. The report suggested that a Dr312bn revenue package be launched next month. Mr Stefanos Manos, economy minister, has been considering further spending cuts. But he faces objections from other cabinet ministers who fear the political cost of fresh austerity measures. The government's popularity is already at low ebb because of a public sector pay freeze, imposed with inflation above 18 per cent. Greece last year failed to meet most targets set under a medium-term economic stabilisation programme launched in return for an Ecu2.2bn (Pounds 1.54bn) loan by the EC. The government's net borrowing requirement fell more slowly than forecast, in 1991, to 14.1 per cent of gross domestic product, compared with a target of 10.4 per cent. Also, the government was unable to service the public debt fully, because of a Dr238bn shortfall in tax revenues. Greece has shown some reluctance in the past to follow the advice of Commission officials monitoring the economy. Commission officials have also expressed doubts about the accuracy of Greek government departmental figures, according to economy ministry officials. The report noted that forecasts for 1992 appeared 'overly optimistic' and pointed out that net borrowing requirements had been understated last year.</p>

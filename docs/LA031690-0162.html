			<p><P> March 16, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> CATERWAUL SHOW WASHES OUT MYSTERY  </P> <P> Caterwaul makes music that thrives in the dark -- hypnotic, impressionistic  waves of sound that can conjure some interesting dream images and nocturnal  landscapes.  </P> <P> It is hard to fathom why a band whose whole method is mystery would want to  play a show with the house lights on, but that's what Caterwaul did Wednesday  as it headlined the weekly Club Tangent alternative-rock night at the Marquee.  </P> <P> Watching Caterwaul from under the glow of red-coated electric bulbs was like  trick-or-treating at noon -- the light washed all the mystery out of the  experience. Any images the songs and sounds might have conjured were expunged  like snapshots in a popped-open camera.  </P> <P> The only conceivable excuse for keeping a nightclub lit like a cafeteria might  be a band's intention to turn a concert into a communal experience. But singer  Betsy Martin made only tentative attempts to connect with a sparse audience of  perhaps 100 people. Caterwaul's four members performed in self-contained  fashion, wrapped in their own reveries, or perhaps in their own cocoons of  boredom.  </P> <P> It's not that the Los Angeles band played badly. Guitarist Mark Schafer and  bassist Fred Cross set up the basic moody soundscape -- Schafer with echoing  sheets of distorted sound, and Cross with a steady thrum (the bassist played in  a hunched-over position that would instill high hopes in the heart of any  business-starved chiropractor).  </P> <P> Martin had no trouble reproducing the strange, incantational singing that is  the focus of Caterwaul's two albums, "Pin &amp; Web" and the newly released  "Portent Hue." She has a rangy voice that can move with sure pitch and control  from a cracked, cronelike husk to a disembodied Appalachian falsetto. On record  it is evocative. In this uninspired concert it was merely unusual.  </P> <P> Unusual, but not unique. Martin's tone recalls Marianne Faithfull's memorable  wreck of a voice and the frayed, nervous charge in the singing of Throwing  Muses' Kristin Hersh. Unlike Faithfull and Hersh, whose material fully supports  their pained vocal contortions, it is sometimes hard to detect the reasons for  Caterwaul's wailing. Martin's songs obviously are set at emotional extremes,  but the lyrics offer few hints as to why. In concert, Martin's occasional  dancer's whirls and tosses of a full blond mane of curls weren't enough to  illuminate the cryptic codes in her music.  </P> <P> It would have helped if Caterwaul, which originated in Phoenix, had  concentrated on its best material. But, with the exception of one folk-style  ballad and the charging set-closing rocker "Stumped," it stayed with more  shapeless, mid-tempo mood pieces that devolved into sameness. Playing a stingy  50-minute set, Caterwaul couldn't be bothered to play stronger numbers like  "Manna and Quail," leaving it to the club disc jockey to toss that tune on  after the show was over.  </P> <P> The second-billed Pivot Foots are a local band whose album, "Wingless Birds of  Flight" is full of intelligent, wryly written songs and enjoyable stylistic  dabbling. But the Long Beach trio hasn't yet found its footing as a stage band.  There are plenty of punch lines and comic observations in the songs written by  brothers Brent and Blair Walker, but Blair's harsh, husky voice was blunt and  straining when nuance and control would have served the songs better. To pull  it off live, the Pivot Foots will have to establish more confident vocal and  instrumental chops so they can concentrate freely on projecting the personality  that abounds in their songs.  </P> <P> Opening band Naked Soul showed some of the virtues and vices of the  Replacements. The four-member band had a raw, edgy attack, and singer Mike  Conley achieved an Angst-ridden emotionalism reminiscent of the Replacements'  Paul Westerberg. Like the Replacements, Naked Soul also showed an inclination  to indulge itself in sloppy, amateurish clowning. Unlike the Replacements, who  have largely renounced those old ways, Naked Soul is totally unproven and can't  afford to waste its listeners' time.  </P></p>

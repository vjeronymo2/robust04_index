			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Early Morning" newscast] </F>   [Text] Commissioner for Peace and Reconciliation Manuel  Camacho Solis has presented to President Carlos Salinas de  Gortari his resignation from the commission that led the peace  negotiations in Chiapas.    Camacho thus announced his withdrawal from public life and  politics during the present administration to devote himself to  his family.    [Begin Camacho recording] I am leaving the administration  after having held responsible posts in times of tension. I have  the peace of mind of having respected citizens' rights for  social organizations, labor unions, and opposition groups, while  defending at all times the government's institutions and public  interests.    Now, just when I had achieved a bilateral truce for Chiapas,  with the government's full support, there have been expressions  of criticism regarding my job. Every resource at hand has been  used to spread that criticism and to portray it as the  government's position. [end recording]    In a letter, Camacho Solis suggested to President Salinas  that the peace negotiations in Chiapas be partially taken over  by Chiapas Governor Javier Lopez Moreno and also by the  secretaries of finance, government and foreign affairs.    [Begin Camacho recording] To achieve new progress in the  peace process, it is necessary at this time to unite the  military, to prevent an exacerbation of social conflicts in  Chiapas, to conduct extremely careful proselytism activities in  the Chiapas electoral campaign, and to design a strategy for a  new phase of negotiations. [end recording]    Camacho Solis also commented on recent remarks by PRI  [Institutional Revolutionary Party] presidential candidate  Ernesto Zedillo concerning the Chiapas issue.    [Begin Camacho recording] His assertions regarding the  Chiapas conflict have weakened the political negotiations and  the role I could have played in taking new steps toward peace.  [end recording]    Camacho Solis emphasized that the truce agreed on in Chiapas  has not failed, and it is a mistake to compare it to a delay in  armed actions. He concluded by saying there are two options in  this case: the achievement of peace through agreements or  through war, whereby victory would be achieved through the use  of weapons.    President Salinas accepted Peace Commissioner Camacho's  resignation. A communique states that the president  acknowledged that Camacho Solis has always carried out the  duties entrusted to him with honesty, skill, and political  conviction. He thanked Camacho for his efforts and  determination to consolidate peace in Chiapas, adding that the  San Cristobal talks were an important phase in the effort to  achieve a political solution of this conflict. Salinas de  Gortari said that henceforth the negotiations will be  coordinated by the Executive Committee directed by the governor  of Chiapas.</p>

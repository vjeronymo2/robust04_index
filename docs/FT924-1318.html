			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Bromsgrove advances 25% but remains cautious on outlook BROMSGROVE Industries, the Birmingham-based specialist engineering group, increased pre-tax profits by 25 per cent on the back of recent acquisitions but remained cautious about its immediate prospects. The increase to Pounds 4m (Pounds 3.2m) for the six months to September 30 came on turnover ahead to Pounds 54.1m (Pounds 39.4m). Earnings per share, on capital enlarged last March by a 1-for-4 rights issue, were 4.07p against 5.41p. The interim dividend goes up 10 per cent to 1.65p; Mr Bijan Sedghi, chairman, said the group would 'look to an increase in the final dividend.' Although Mr Sedghi described Bromsgrove's medium to long-term performance as 'a sound prospect', he observed that the short term depended 'upon there being no interruptions to customer schedules.' Bromsgrove is already experiencing sharp fluctuations in the schedules of automotive customers like Ford and GM. Mr Sedghi would go no further in predicting the second half's outcome than saying 'we aim to be cash generative, more profitable.' The acquisition of Thornton, a precision forgings company, and of companies to form an environmental engineering division at the end of the 1991-92 financial year contributed Pounds 1.6m to the first half outcome. Businesses owned by the group at the end of last year's first half reported pre-tax profits 15 per cent lower. Of the group's other five divisions, automotive and industrial reported a downturn in first half profits compared with 1991-92, while there were increases from aerospace, marine and offshore and, especially, from plastics where the Trisport subsidiary introduced with great success into the US a new range of systems for golf footwear.</p>

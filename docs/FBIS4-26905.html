			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Reporter Zhao Jingyun (6392 7231 0061): "The </F> Construction of the New-Tech Industrial Development Experimental  Zone, the Beijing Economic and Technological Development Zone,  and the District and County Small Industrial Zones Has  Preliminarily Taken Shape"]    [Excerpts] Reporter learned of the fact from the foreign  capital work conference of the new-tech industrial development  experimental zone, the Beijing economic and technological  development zone, and the district and county small industrial  zones that the construction of these "three zones" has  preliminarily taken shape, and these three zones will become new  growing points, sources of radiation, and productive forces for  urban and rural economic development.    The development and construction of these "three zones" are  a  major strategic policy decision for deepening reform and  expanding the scale of opening up, a key way for realizing the  overall urban and rural plan and accelerating the readjustment  of the overall urban and rural arrangement, and a key way for  coordinating urban areas with rural ones and reducing the  differences between urban and rural areas; and will play an  extremely important role in readjusting the industrial structure  and the product mix. At present, the municipality has had a  state-level new-tech industrial development experimental zone, a  municipal-level economic and technological development zone, and  22 district- and county-level small industrial zones; and an  open-typed economic development pattern characterized by urban  areas and rural areas' combination, rational distribution,  mutual reliance, and coordinate development has preliminarily  taken shape. Last year, the total industrial output value of  the "three zones" surpassed 4.5 billion yuan. Thus, the "three  zones" play an increasingly more noticeable role in the  municipality's economic construction. [passage omitted]    At the time of firmly grasping the construction of  infrastructural facilities, the "three zones," being popular  areas with investment by internationally trans-national  companies, have positively opened for business and introduced  capital. So far, more than 5,000 enterprises have entered the  zones. Of this, there are about 1,100 foreign-funded  enterprises of three types, and nearly $1 billion foreign  capital have been introduced according to agreements. Some 6.9  square kilometers of land, valued at 2 billion yuan, have been  transferred to the enterprises that have entered the "three  zones." More than 20 internationally famous trans-national  companies built plants in these "three zones." More than 10  large trans-national companies are holding talks with the zones.

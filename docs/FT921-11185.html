			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Air passenger traffic down 4% in 1991 RECESSION and the Gulf War made 1991 a financial disaster for airlines, the International Air Transport Association (Iata) said yesterday, writes Daniel Green. Iata confirmed predictions it made last year by saying that 1991 saw a fall in world air passenger traffic of 4 per cent. 'Traffic in 1991 was very disappointing for the airlines," said Mr Gunter Eser, Iata's director-general. 'Although we do not yet have final details, we know that the year was a disaster financially.' Passenger load factor - how full the aircraft were on international scheduled services - was 65 per cent in December and 67 per cent for the whole year. In 1990 it was 68.6 per cent. On Thursday, the Association of European Airlines said that its members had suffered a decline of 7 per cent in passenger numbers last year. The European Community and the US failed to agree yesterday in what circumstances they should allow state subsidies to the aircraft industry, EC officials said, Reuter reports from Brussels.</p>

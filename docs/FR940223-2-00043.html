In determining whether a proposed activity is closely related to banking for purposes of the BHC Act, the Board considers,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> inter alia <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , the matters set forth in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> National Courier Association v. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 516 F.2d 1229 (D.C. Cir. 1975). These considerations are <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Whether banks generally have in fact provided the proposed services, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Whether banks generally provide services that are operationally or functionally so similar to the proposed services as to equip them particularly well to provide the proposed services, and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Whether banks generally provide services that are so integrally related to the proposed services as to require their provision in a specialized form.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  516 F.2d at 1237. In addition, the Board may consider any other basis that may demonstrate that the activity has a reasonable or close relationship to banking or managing or controlling banks.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Board Statement Regarding Regulation Y <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 49 FR 806 (1984). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applicant states that the Board previously has determined by regulation that certain of the proposed activities, when conducted within the limitations established by the Board in its regulations and in related interpretations and orders, are closely related to banking for purposes of section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  12 CFR 225.25(b)(1) (making, acquiring, and servicing loans and other extensions of credit); 12 CFR 225.25(b)(4) and (15) (certain investment and financial advisory services and discount and full-service brokerage activities); and 12 CFR 225.25(b)(18) and (19) (certain FCM services and related advisory activities). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applicant also maintains that the Board previously has determined by order that several of the other proposed activities, when conducted within the limitations established by the Board in its previous orders, are closely related to banking, and, where applicable, consistent with section 20 of the Glass-Steagall Act (12 U.S.C. 377).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See, e.g., J.P.

Applicant maintains, however, that all of these proposed activities are closely related to banking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to the proposal for Company to trade for its own account in various futures, options, and options on futures transactions based on certificates of deposit and other money market instruments eligible for investment by national banks, Applicant maintains that the Board has previously determined that trading in derivative instruments which represent the right to purchase or sell bank-eligible securities is closely related to banking. See Swiss Bank Corporation, 77 Federal Reserve Bulletin 759 (1991) (approving such trading for instruments based on U.S. government securities and certain money market instruments).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applicant also proposes that Company trade for its own account, for purposes other than hedging, in futures, options, and options on futures contracts based on commodity prices and stock, bond, and commodity indexes. With respect to this aspect of the proposal, Applicant maintains that the New York State Banking Department (NYSBD) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) have permitted banks under their respective jurisdictions to engage in these activities, subject to certain limitations. In this regard, Applicant also states that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> over-the-counter options contracts entered into by Company would represent a form of financial intermediation of the type in which banks have traditionally engaged. Applicant also maintains that Company's portfolio-wide hedging methodology is consistent with the limitations the NYSBD and the OCC have placed upon trading in exchange-traded derivative instruments. Applicant also argues,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> inter alia <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , that Company needs to be able to trade in these contracts in order to manage commodity-based risks that may arise from its dealing in securities of issuers with commodity price exposure. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to the swap-related activities that have not previously been determined to be closely related to banking, Applicant states that the NYSBD and the OCC have permitted banks under their respective jurisdictions to engage in commodity-based swap activities, and that the NYSBD has permitted banks to offer swaps linked to financial or economic indexes. Applicant also states that the Board has recognized, in an interpretation of the Board's Regulation H, that banks are engaged as principal or broker in swap transactions based on commodity prices, stock and bond indexes, and hybrids of such indexes and interest rates.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  12 CFR 208.128. In addition, Applicant maintains that these types of swap transactions, like interest rate and currency swaps, are a form of the financial intermediation services traditionally offered by banks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applicant also proposes that Company and SBC Derivatives engage in FCM activities and provide related advisory services with respect to futures contracts and options on futures contracts based on commodity prices, bonds, and stock and bond indexes. Applicant states that the Board has previously determined by order that offering FCM and related advisory services with respect to certain futures contracts and options on futures contracts based on bonds and stock and bond indexes is an activity closely related to banking. See generally SR Letter No. 93-27 (FIS) (May 21, 1993) (listing various futures, options, and options on futures contracts previously approved by order or regulation for FCM services and related advisory activities). Applicant maintains that the bond- and index-based futures contracts and options on futures contracts in this proposal which have not previously been approved by the Board are substantially similar to those which have been so approved. With respect to the proposed instruments based on commodity prices, Applicant states that the OCC has permitted national banks to execute and clear such contracts. Applicant also maintains that the reasons justifying Company's trading in such contracts for its own account should apply equally to Company's and SBC Derivatives' engaging in execution, clearance, and advisory activities with respect to such contracts. Applicant further states that providing these services with respect to commodity-based contracts is functionally equivalent to providing such services with respect to financial futures and options on futures contracts. Applicant also notes that the clearing function of an FCM is a form of extending credit, a primary banking function.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to its proposal that Company trade for its own account in platinum coin and bullion, Applicant states that the NYSBD and the OCC have approved this activity for banks under their respective jurisdictions. Applicant also maintains that the Board has approved under section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act the purchase and sale of platinum coins, under limited circumstances.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See Standard Chartered PLC <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 76 Federal Reserve Bulletin 681 (1990). Applicant also states that the Board has approved, under Regulation K (12 CFR part 211), trading in platinum by bank holding company subsidiaries located outside the United States.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. Incorporated <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 76 Federal Reserve Bulletin 552 (1990).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Proper Incident to Banking Standard <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In order to approve the proposal, the Board must determine that the proposed activities to be conducted by Company ``can reasonably be expected to produce benefits to the public, such as greater convenience, increased competition, or gains in efficiency, that outweigh possible adverse effects, such as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interests, or unsound banking practices.'' 12 U.S.C. 1843(c)(8). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applicant believes that the proposal will produce public benefits that outweigh any potential adverse effects. In particular, Applicant maintains that the proposal will enhance competition and enable Company to offer its customers a broader range of products. In addition, Applicant states that the proposed activities will not result in adverse effects such as an undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interest, or unsound banking practices. In publishing the proposal for comment, the Board does not take a position on issues raised by the proposal. Notice of the proposal is published solely in order to seek the views of interested persons on the issues presented by the application, and does not represent a determination by the Board that the proposal meets or is likely to meet the standards of the BHC Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any comments or requests for hearing should be submitted in writing and received by William W. Wiles, Secretary, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, D.C. 20551, not later than March 14, 1994.

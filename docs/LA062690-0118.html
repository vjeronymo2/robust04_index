			<p><P> June 26, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BLAST ROCKS LONDON CLUB FREQUENTED BY TORIES  </P> <P> A bomb exploded Monday evening in an exclusive social club in downtown London  frequented by members of the ruling Conservative Party. Nine people were  injured, one seriously, authorities said.  </P> <P> The victims of the blast at the Carlton Club included Lord Kaberry, 82, a  member of the House of Lords, his wife said. Two tourists from New York,  Alexander Kahan, 62, and his wife, Jane, 49, suffered minor cuts from flying  glass.  </P> <P> "Two seconds further along the road and we could have been killed," Kahan said.  </P> <P> The bomb, containing 10 to 15 pounds of high explosives, was planted just  inside the door of the 158-year-old club, said George Churchill-Coleman, head  of Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist squad. The club has long been considered one  of the most venerable symbols of the British Establishment.  </P> <P> There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but suspicion fell on the Irish  Republican Army, which has been waging a new terror campaign to end British  rule in Northern Ireland.  </P> <P> "It brings a new dimension to the campaign, and I must warn the public in  general that these people are determined to cause injury and maim," said  Churchill-Coleman, clearly alluding to the IRA. "Everyone must be on their  guard."  </P> <P> The bombers struck at one of the most popular meeting places for Cabinet  ministers, lawmakers and other members of the governing Conservative Party.  </P> <P> Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, an honorary member of the exclusive men's  club, called the attack "one more outrage in a catalog of terrorist  inhumanity."  </P> <P> "Whoever is responsible stands condemned of total and callous disregard for  human life, both within the club and among passers-by," she said in Dublin,  Ireland, where she was attending a European Community summit. "These people are  prepared to bomb and maim others indiscriminately for their own perverted  satisfaction."  </P> <P> It was the worst attack on a Conservative Party target since 1984, when an IRA  bomb narrowly missed Thatcher in a hotel in the seaside resort of Brighton.  </P> <P> The explosion occurred at 8:40 p.m. on the first floor of the club, which is  near Trafalgar Square and a few hundred yards from Buckingham Palace  </P></p>

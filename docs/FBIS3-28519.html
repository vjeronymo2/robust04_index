			<p>Language: <F P=105> Cambodian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] People have asked this question: The United States  has set itself up as the defender of human rights. Why then  does the U.S. Government embrace the puppet of the Vietnamese  communists named Sin Song, great murderer and criminal, and let  him go to the United States?    It has been reported that the U.S. State Department has  issued a visa to Vietnamese communist puppet Sin Song to travel  to the United States. This report, picked up from Western  foreign news agencies, says that Sin Song is a murderer. He  killed over 400 members of various political parties and  arrested over 3,000 others during the May 1993 pre-election  period. The Cambodian nation and people still clearly remember  that before the May 1993 elections, puppet Sin Sing was the  security chief of Vietnam's puppets. He has mistreated,  arrested, and executed hundreds of people and members of various  political parties. Furthermore, in July 1993 puppet Sin Song  led the movement of seven eastern provinces to secede from  Cambodia and opposed the national reconciliation plan offered by  the prince father [Sihanouk].    The Cambodian nation and people have condemned the  Vietnamese  communist puppet Sin Song as a great criminal and murderer, who  kills the Cambodian nation and people, and as a traitor. The  way the United States has embraced the puppet Sin Song has made  people ask this question: The United States have set themselves  up as defenders of human rights. Why then does the U.S.  Government issue a visa to the Vietnamese communist puppet Sin  Song, great criminal and murderer, to travel to the United  States?</p>

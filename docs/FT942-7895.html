			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / Economic Watch: Italian inflation disappoints Italian financial markets reacted badly yesterday to preliminary figures which indicated that inflation was not coming down as quickly as expected. Preliminary figures for May, based on data collected from nine Italian cities, indicated that retail prices would show an increase of 0.4 per cent for this month, compared with the previous year, giving an annual inflation rate of 4.1 per cent. The data, prepared by the municipality of Bologna, is normally confirmed by the state statistical institute after the end of the month. Economic analysts had expected the April increase of 0.3 per cent to be confirmed, which would have suggested an annual inflation rate of 4 per cent. Equity investors, positive about the stock market since the election of a right-wing government in Italy in March, used the news as an excuse to take profits yesterday morning. Andrew Hill, Milan. Figures issued by the Bank of Italy revealed that the public sector deficit narrowed to L41,690bn (Pounds 17.4bn) in the first three months of the year, compared with L50,810bn in the first quarter of 1993. Italy's industrial wholesale sales index rose a real 7.8 per cent in January from a year earlier, the state statistical Institute, Istat, said yesterday. The January figure compared with a 5.7 per cent year-on-year increase in December 1993. The Spanish insurance sector's combined premiums issued in 1993 were 10 per cent higher than the previous year at Pta2,660bn (Pounds 12.9bn), according to provisional figures released yesterday by the central government's Directorate General of Insurance.</p>

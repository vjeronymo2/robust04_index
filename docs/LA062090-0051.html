			<p><P> June 20, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SAN FRANCISCO;  </P> <P> FIREFIGHTERS GET BIAS SETTLEMENT  </P> <P> Civic leaders have agreed to pay more than $500,000 to 13 black firefighters to  settle claims that they suffered from racist attitudes and abuse during the  1980s.  </P> <P> The 13 charged they were the target of physical and verbal harassment by some  white firefighters who hassled their black peers with gorilla noises and by  posting abusive materials in lockers. "What's truly frightening is the failure  of the fire administration at the time to intervene in these embarrassing  incidents of racial harassment," county Supervisor Harry Britt said. The  settlements, involving actions that occurred between 1981 and 1988, ranged from  $10,000 to $85,000.  </P></p>

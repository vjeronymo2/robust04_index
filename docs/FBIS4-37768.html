			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Nizar Daw-al-Na'im and Kamal Hamid: "Sudan: Ummah </F> Party Threatens To Resort to Armed Action"]    [Excerpts] London, Khartoum -- The Sudanese opposition  Ummah Party warned yesterday that it will resort to armed action  against President 'Umar al-Bashir's regime if the party's  leader, former prime minister al-Sadiq al-Mahdi, and two of the  party's other leaders arrested on charges of planning to carry  out bombings and political assassination are subjected to  "violence" or if "the regime resorts to bloody [physical]  liquidation." The party stressed that it "it has not taken any  decision to resort to military action and it is still committed  to a peaceful solution. However, it is leaving the door open to  the option of replying to aggression."    In a press conference they held in London yesterday,  attended  by some leaders of the other parties who stressed their parties'  solidarity and condemned al-Mahdi's arrest, Ummah Party leaders  said that "the Ummah Party's principled position is against  assassinations and bombings, which the Sudanese scene has never  witnessed before and which conflicts with Sudanese ethics."    Mubarak al-Fadil al-Mahdi, head of the party's Executive  Bureau and official in charge of external action, said: "We  chose political struggle as a means to oppose that military  regime without seeking to shed blood or request foreign  intervention. Historically, we resorted to armed struggle  against aggression twice: once against colonialism and once  against (former President Ja'far) Numayri after he destroyed the  strongholds of Ansar al-Mahdi [followers of Imam al-Mahdi] and  killed their imam." He said: "While we adhere to the peaceful  struggle option, we keep our other options open. And if the  ruling (National Islamic) Front resorts to violence and to  bloody liquidation and opens the door of aggression, our party  will leave the door open to the resumption of armed action."  [passage omitted]    Dr. 'Umar Nur-al-Da'im, secretary general of the Ummah  Party,  also spoke at the conference, stressing that "the political and  economic crises the regime is experiencing, as well as the  crises in its relations with the world, prompted the fabrication  of accusations against the party's leaders. The fabrication of  this kind of theatrical ploy is characteristic of military  regimes, because they are based on conspiracy and have no  legitimacy." He said that al-Bashir's regime "has been  tyrannical for five years and lacks constitutional legitimacy,  as it has done the opposite of what it promised in its first  statement."    He pointed out that "the rejection of the regime has begun  to  increase while popular and regional support for it has declined,  and there is now a general belief that the regime is about to  collapse."    He said that the recent accusations against al-Mahdi are  made  "because he managed to set up a leadership for the Democratic  National Grouping inside the country and to establish strong  opposition committed to civil resistance." He added that  "al-Mahdi insists on this line despite the the great pressures  put on him to engage in an armed battle with the regime." He  said that the Ummah Party does not want a military  confrontation, "because the loser will be the people of Sudan  and those representing them, not the small (Islamic) Front  organization." He said that an armed confrontation would mean  turning Sudan into a situation similar to the one Rwanda is  currently experiencing.    He believes that leveling accusations at the Ummah Party "is  a trick designed to avoid the scandals that the defendants being  tried in the Ansar al-Sunnah Mosque massacre case could reveal."    He stressed that "the political and economic siege,  corruption, the regime's isolation, and international  condemnations of it have caused the regime to behave  hysterically. And we will confront the Front if it persists in  its behavior. We are optimistic that the regime is about to  collapse, and its actions will change nothing in the situation.  We are against violence and have not yet decided on the armed  action option. But if physical liquidations begin, we will have  to reply to that aggression." [passage omitted]</p>

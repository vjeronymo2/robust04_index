			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Communique issued by the National Directorate of the </F> Sandinist National Liberation Front on 22 March; place not given]    [Text] The FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation Front]  National Directorate [DN] hereby voices its full moral support  for the sensible attitude of Army Chief General Humberto Ortega,  who went with a constructive spirit before a court of justice to  give a deposition.    The DN agrees with all of the points in the letter made  public yesterday by the army chief, who said there is an  organized political manipulation over the sorrowful death of  young Jean Paul Genie.    The DN expresses its solidarity with the Sandinist People's  Army [EPS] in the face of an attempt to ruin the EPS' prestige  and eliminate it through a campaign orchestrated by  ultrarightist sectors from Nicaragua and the United States.    The EPS has been fundamentally an instrument of defense of  sovereignty and self-determination, peace and reconciliation,  and our people admit that. The Army has shown a high spirit of  institutional discipline, and it is a solid guarantee for the  stability of Nicaragua.    The government, the justice courts, civilian society, and  the  FSLN are obligated to consolidate that role. The FSLN hereby  makes an appeal that tragic events such as the case of Jean Paul  Genie not to be manipulated or politicized and that justice be  expedited for the satisfaction of all Nicaraguans.  Free fatherland or death. FSLN DN.</p>

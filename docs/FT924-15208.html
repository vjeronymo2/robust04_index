			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / Arts: Tippett and Strauss Richard Strauss was 77 when he composed Capriccio, his last opera, and there was only a little 'late Strauss' still to come - notably, of course, the Four Last Songs. When Sir Michael Tippett wrote his Triple Concerto more than a dozen years ago he was 74, but even now there seems to be no swansong in the offing. Piece after piece comes from him still, often vigorous and always idiosyncratic. The Triple Concerto, which Andre Previn conducted with the London Symphony at the Barbican on Sunday, is among the most splendid of his late works. The orchestral invention is rich and telling, the solo roles - for violin, viola and cello - dramatically contrasted and eloquent. Evidently those roles are full of rewards; they seem to inspire the players who take them up. Here they were the orchestra's leader, Alexander Barantschik, and its (co-)principal viola and cello, Edward Vanderspar and Moray Welsh. In that sense, they are an experienced trio. Their dialogues sang with arching passion, not forgetting Tippett's characteristic flicks of mischief. Previn's gift for achieving a lucid balance in the tricky Barbican acoustic was well-found: the orchestra never sounded throttled, but every solo line came through intact. This entirely gripping performance followed a tamer one of Mozart's Symphony no. 39 (gracious and sensible, untouched by recent experiments in lighter, leaner 'period' style), and was itself followed by Capriccio excerpts: the 'moonlight' interlude, and Kiri te Kanawa in the Countess's closing monologue. The interlude began grumpily, with a first horn who seemed to have left his legato at home somewhere, and the music failed to make its best silvery effect. Dame Kiri's soprano was silvery enough, and lovely. Impossible not to surrender to it, in this ravishing Straussery; impossible also, though, not to regret the words, which were all but lost. This is one of Strauss's most inspired operatic monologues, and its shape - its calculated dramatic form - needs more pointed attention to verbal sense than Dame Kiri cared to give it. It was naughty of the programme-book to suppress the major-domo's closing line, even if it wasn't to be sung here. As the Countess's last rhetorical question hangs in the air - 'Is there no ending to this opera that wouldn't be trivial?' - he announces: 'Countess, supper is served.'

The reforms authorize the Executive  Branch to revoke the passports of persons involved in the Banco  Latino debacle.    The reforms, which were approved by the Council of  Ministers,  include seven basic points and modify 17 articles. Among the  most important reforms are the Executive Branch's authority to  revoke passports; to have control over Fogade [Deposit Guarantee  Fund] assistance to institutions; to regulate operations related  to the purchase of Banco Latino's debts; to modify legal  conditions to encourage the participation of foreign banks in  the process; and to [word indistinct] the bidding, delayed  payment, and bankruptcy procedures currently hindering the  government's action. The reforms also included the stipulation  that the Supreme Court's political and administrative court has  to be informed of any amparo proceedings related to the Banco  Latino case.

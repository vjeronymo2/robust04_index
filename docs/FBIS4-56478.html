			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Closing address by President Fidel Castro at the special </F> session of the National Assembly of the People's Government,  ANPP, at the Havana Convention Center on 2 May -- recorded]    [Text] I am going to speak very briefly. Yesterday, I  expressed some essential ideas on this issue. Today, we heard a  brilliant exposition by Comrade Alarcon that should be  considered a summary of what we have discussed here. I believe  that now the most difficult part begins: the implementation of  the recommendations and duties the National Assembly of the  People's Government [ANPP] has entrusted to the government.    I believe that what was agreed to here is coherent and it  provides a broad, extremely broad, framework in which to make  the most appropriate decisions. Logically, the most difficult  part is the implementation. As I mentioned yesterday, all this  requires a plan and time. Time does not mean that this will be  left up to the Greek calendar, but a minimal time. Some of the  practical applications of the measures discussed are  complicated. Almost every organization involved in the  implementation of these measures needs time. Even the comrades  from the electric service, once it is decided whether to  implement the principle of increasing electric rates, will need  some time to implement them.    Anything having to do with the change of currency is a  complex issue. This requires a lot of imagination, original  thinking in order to implement any measures of this kind in the  most frugal way possible.    This accord has the advantage of flexibility and a broad  scope to allow the government to analyze and consult in order to  take these measures -- not only the measures recommended here  but also those whose adoption might be considered appropriate  within these principles. We have to analyze well which measures  from the relatively long list divulged by Comrade [Finance  Minister] Jose Luis Rodriguez are truly appropriate .    I must repeat what I said yesterday: We have to act so we do  not stop halfway down the road. We have to act decisively. We  have to act so the problem is solved. The worst thing would be  to leave things half solved. We must solve it completely, not  only to guarantee recovery from the excess currency, but also to  ensure progressive improvement in the situation until a time  when we can say: This is it, the moment when we can be sure the  problem is not going to replicate. It would serve nothing to  have to meet here again, in one or two years, to say that we  have a similar situation.    We have to figure out how to avoid that. Therefore, the  measures taken ought to guarantee it. This is of the utmost  importance. It is decisive. We must act serenely, thoughtfully,  speedily; assume responsibility; be courageous; work, explain,  and divulge.    I believe everything discussed here, without exception,  ought  to be divulged through radio, newspapers, and television in  order to attain the people's understanding, or the greater  possible understanding, of what has been said here by several  comrades, and to continue explaining. The media have to help in  explaining the importance of taking all these measures. The  population has to understand. I am convinced the people are  going to understand.    I believe the fact that many aspects of Cuba's history are  well-known, or supposedly well-known, is no reason not to  disseminate as widely as possible Comrade Alarcon's words before  the recess. What he said, with great accuracy and clarity, is  part of the ideological struggle we are waging. They want to  bring capitalist prescriptions to Cuba. There are no such  prescriptions: Even the developed capitalist countries have many  problems they have not solved. What is reported in that magazine  from Florida is evidence of that. Similar things can be said of  the wealthiest capitalists countries. Their unemployment  problems are appalling. They have a special situation where the  economy is growing and the number of jobs, dropping. They cannot  boast of being models to the world when that is the model they  parade before the world.    We have the great merit of resisting and have time in our  favor. We also know what is happening in the rest of the world,  particularly in the Third World, and the dire crises into which  neoliberal theories are dragging those countries. We do not have  a smidgen of neoliberalism or capitalism. We are truly facing a  world completely ruled by neoliberalism and capitalism. This  does not mean that we are going to surrender. This means that we  have to adapt many things to the reality of that world. That we  are doing, but with much equanimity, without relinquishing our  ideals, our goals.    I ask that you have complete trust in what the party and  government do. They are defending, to the last atom, socialist  ideas, principles, and goals. Even if we have to it under  conditions as difficult as these.    I want to tell you that the world is in the hands of the  multinational corporations; the world is entirely in the hands  of capitalism, and it will last a relatively long time; and a  revolution as pure as ours, as firm and committed as ours, is  forced to take those realities and factors into account.    At times, I have talked about the fuel situation, where for  us to be able to explore for fuel, to be able to use it -- if we  find it -- we need to make agreements with multinational  corporations, and we have to adjust ourselves to the interests  of those enterprises, combining them with our own interests. But  these are things that we would not have done if we had had the  capital and technology to exploit those resources.    In other words, even though we have had to make concessions,  we make the conditions... [pauses] the concessions that are  unavoidable in order to survive and to be able to develop  ourselves. Because we are not only talking about living in a  world dominated and hegemonigized by capitalism and imperialism;  we are talking about a world in which our country is blockaded  by the world's most powerful economic, political, and military  power. It carries out any action it wishes to block our economic  work.    Despite this, I must also add, the number of foreign  companies interested in dealing with Cuba increases. These firms  are interested in Cuba's security and stability. I should also  mention that we occupy one of the [pauses] an important place on  the list of countries considered safe for foreign investments.  The number of firms, I repeat, interested in dealing with Cuba  is growing, despite enormous pressure by the United States.    Comrades, I must also say that our problems are not limited  only to internal finances, excess currency, and the problems  that this brings to our daily work. We must constantly face a  great scarcity of resources, the problem involving the purchase  of food for the population, the problem involving the purchase  of medicine for the population, the purchase of fuel for our  economy, the purchase of spare parts and all types of materials,  so that our economy can remain in operation and so our plans can  advance.    A comrade spoke of the very real situation we have, even  with  agricultural tools like plows. He was right when he said our  industry can make plows. That is true. But each one of those  plows requires a certain amount of steel of very different types  that must be purchased for hard currency on the world market. We  have been working without fertilizers. Many times we have been  working without pesticides. Guaranteeing the fuel needed each  day for transportation and agriculture is an agony.    With this I want to say to you that we are working under  very  difficult conditions. But we are not discouraged. We continue to  struggle, invent, and work. We look for solutions. I can assure  you that our country is facing these difficulties, which are not  discussed every day, in an exemplary manner.    We could also say that many times our cane cutters have had  to work barefooted. Many workers have had to carry out their  tasks without proper clothing. The food that is given to the  workers does not always supply the nutrition they need for the  tasks they perform, despite the effort being made to increase  food production and self-sufficiency. We cannot, for a single  minute, forget the extraordinarily difficult conditions under  which we are working.    I believe there was a reason that Alarcon mentioned  Guaymaro.  This is not only Guaymaro; this is the 10-year war in which we  are trying, despite the many shortages and difficulties, to keep  the population from being in need; to see that the population  never lacks even recreation, when it is possible; that children  and their mothers never lack essentials.    I believe our people are truly writing a page in history. I  believe that what we have agreed to here is an example of  courage, of awareness, of how we, without ignoring all the other  things, dedicate ourselves to solving these problems because  solving them helps us continue our struggle. We must keep all  these things in mind. The enemy tries to plant discouragement  and tries to dishearten our people. We must wage a parallel  struggle to encourage, to strengthen them morally, to lift their  spirit of combat.    Just look at the news we hear from all around the world on  the magnitude of the ceremonies marking 1 May. There are places  where, I was told, more than 100,000 people gathered to  celebrate this day. We considered it an appropriate arrangement,  instead of making the great mobilization of all these years and  continuing the style of the 26 July festivities, to meet here  and discuss these problems with which we are giving tribute to  the working class because this is the Revolution of the working  class.    We have met here precisely to adopt all those measures that  will help save the Revolution of the working class. This does  not mean that we will never again meet at the Plaza of the  Revolution to participate in parades. As soon as circumstances  allow, we will parade with even greater enthusiasm than ever.    I believe today we are doing the things that we should do  and  that we are doing them in the way that we should. The comrades  of the government will not rest a single minute in drafting and  implementing all the measures. They will not be able to do all  of them at the same time, I repeat once again. It will have to  be one measure today, another tomorrow, and then another, etc.  We must follow the order of the simplest, then the more complex.    And the first one is going to come out, I believe, this very  week. It is a Council of State decree-law regarding the  confiscation of ill-gotten wealth. [applause].    That decree-law has already been drafted and is being  distributed to the members of the Council of State. It is that  simple. It is seen as an expeditious method, without many  complicated formalities. Now, I do not know where these money  hoarders are going to put what they have because I do not think  they will be able to get away so easily; they who have so  notably and scandalously become rich from the people's sacrifice.    This reminds us of the first years of the Revolution, when a  law was established to confiscate the ill-gotten goods of those  who had grown rich during the tyranny. Later, each of the prices  will have to be analyzed; they will be applied as soon as  possible because calculations must be based on availability and  different formulas.    There will always be doubts, one way or another, as to  whether it would have been better to do it this way or some  other. Because we must also act with a political criterion. We  must also be tactful. Some things are not so difficult [pauses]  so easy to apply.    When cigarette prices are changed, because we must change  them...[pauses] Cigarettes can be one of the main sources for  collecting money. We must consider how many we have; how many  are in production; what do we will do about people with the  standing quota, who are probably the older ones -- I believe  they are 38 and older; and what we will do about those who have  the new quota.    The treatment is not the same today, and it can it be the  same. We must take into account what we will do with the amount  that remains available. We must consider whether all the  consequences would be greater or fewer if we liberate that  product. We must look at it from the political standpoint. We  must figure out the numbers. The collection will not always be  exact. It could happen that, at a set price, those figures are  not met because there was not enough money to purchase them  among those interested in buying them.    That is why some of these decisions about what to do are  unquestionably more complicated and there will always be  opinions: some who will say it was better to do it this way, and  others who will say it was better to do it another way.    It would be nice if a set price were later to be reduced.  But  all these phenomena must be studied because one must also  consider the political sense of each of the things done. We must  also consider salaries, incomes, and the salaries of retired  workers, which usually is not too much. All these factors must  be considered when a decision is going to be made on setting a  price.    There are some areas where there is no alternative. For  electricity, there is no alternative. Because consumption has  increased tremendously. In Havana City it has increased 24  percent. Comrade Marcos Portal explained this very well in great  detail during his television interview. Many people have had to  use electric stoves because we have lacked other types of fuel.  Efforts are being made to find ways to redistribute the  resources in such a way that they can use other fuels that would  make that enormous use of electricity unnecessary.    A quota was established for the use of electricity. It was  met, basically; but a moment came when it was no longer  possible. Portal explained the problems we had with plants and  maintenance. A special effort has been made and continues to be  made and will continue to be made to increase production,  improve maintenance, increase capacities in a way  that...[pauses] But there is no way to satisfy a demand that  increases 24 percent. I believe we can improve in some aspects.    We have gone through tremendous times of outages. Even  broadcasts have been affected. One cannot be sure whether people  are hearing them. They have to be repeated. If you want  something to be heard, you have to broadcast it on Monday, and  then maybe on Wednesday, and then maybe even on Sunday. Our most  important sources of information are television and radio. But  when there are outages, two or three times a week and sometimes  even more, one cannot watch television. Often the radio cannot  be used because there are no batteries. The newspapers are not  enough. Communication today is a problem under the current  conditions.    But I can assure you that no one rests a single moment in  the  search for solutions, economic solutions, in increasing exports  and in the development of all the high priority areas despite  the difficult conditions and the blockade. We are very aware of  how difficult these times are.    These measures that we studied are precisely to help  overcome  these difficult times. That is what we should be doing. I am  sure that is the way that the people of Guaymaro acted. Those  who we know were not there did not hesitate to become combatants  of the 10-Year War. If I am going to compare our current stage  with anything, I will compare it with the 10-Year War. When I  see all that the people...[pauses] Many of these people even had  to fight barefoot, with scarcely any clothing. This does not  mean that we expect people to cut cane barefoot or without  clothes. We must do whatever is possible to [word indistinct]  those resources among the workers.    We could even say that during that war Cubans fought without  weapons. I am sure that those who have a great appreciation for  the great merits of the people and the great value of history  will agree with me when I can say that this struggle does not  remind us of the Sierra Maestra or the Granma expedition; this  struggle reminds us of the 10-Year War. It may be that, in the  future, historians will find this epic as great as that one,  because today we are confronting the hegemony of imperialism on  the world level and the hegemony of capitalism on the world  level. And under those difficult conditions we fight, defending  our ideals, our cause, and our dreams.    We have demonstrated what many thought impossible. After the  collapse of the socialist block and the Soviet Union, almost  four years later, Cuba remains. The country they once called a  satellite has today become a star of heroism, courage,  independence, and light, capable of making history. When history  is written, many will admire how this small country, here in the  Caribbean, only 90 miles from the United States and with a naval  base on its territory, had the courage, the integrity, and the  spirit to wave the banners of independence and the Revolution.    After all these years of experience, we have the conviction  that those banners will continue to wave and will be carried to  victory. In conclusion, that is the reason I can say that some  day, Alarcon, future generations will talk about this assembly  as you spoke of Guaymaro and they will talk about our people as  we have spoken here of the historic Mambis of the War of 1968.  Thank you very much. [applause]</p>

The Korean people will sharply watch the campaign with high  vigilance. We warn the Japanese reactionaries not to act rashly.    This warning is served by today's issue of MINJU CHOSON, the  organ of the DPRK Government.    The author of the commentary titled "Don't act rashly" says:    The Japanese reactionaries have defined the DPRK as  "potential enemy no.1" and "most dangerous country" and declared  that Japan would involve itself in an emergency on the Korean  peninsula, should it arise. This is an open revelation of their  hostile policy.    They raised again the "nuclear issue" and "missile threat"  from the beginning of the year in an attempt to justify their  military power buildup and nuclear armament on that pretext and  realise their ambition for overseas aggrandizement.    The DPRK and the United States have recently agreed to solve  the problems for a fundamental solution of the nuclear issue on  the Korean peninsula in a package deal at the third round of  talks. So Japan is not requested to obtrusively make a fuss  over the "nuclear issue" of the DPRK.    Japan must not take issue with the peaceloving DPRK but make  a sincere apology and compensation to the Korean people for its  past crimes and refrain from further acts obstructive to peace  and peaceful reunification of Korea.</p>

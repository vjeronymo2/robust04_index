			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Storing up long-term doubts: Why it is so hard to put a price on decommissioning THE estimate that it will cost Pounds 18bn to dismantle Britain's civil nuclear facilities begs one main question: the ultimate destination of the radioactive waste. Environmentalists are criticising the NAO report on decommissioning, which is published today, for the 'absurdity' of projecting the costs of decommissioning when the method and timing are still unclear. Mr Simon Roberts of Friends of the Earth, the pressure group, said: 'With no nuclear waste disposal facility in place and no detailed case for safe decommissioning presented to regulators, Pounds 18bn is definitely an opening bid for the cost of the nuclear legacy.' The NAO said yesterday: 'We took the industry's figures for decommissioning costs - we did not recalculate them - but we have pointed out all the uncertainties.' Nuclear facilities generally have a life of several decades, and the process of dismantling them begins immediately they are closed. The cost of decommissioning is high because of the need to shield workers from radioactivity, which requires remote-control machinery, and the need to store the radioactive waste safely, sometimes for centuries, until radioactivity levels have fallen. However, the timescale makes the costs difficult to project. On present plans, decommissioning would carry on for at least 100 years after a plant was closed. As the NAO points out: 'No large-scale reactor has yet been fully decommissioned, either in this country or elsewhere.' The office argued yesterday that the uncertainty of the final destination of the waste did not undermine the industry figures because the cost of storage makes up a third or less of the total figure. However the nuclear companies have made two controversial assumptions about future storage: that an underground repository will be built below Sellafield in Cumbria for medium-level waste, and that British Nuclear Fuels' Thorp reprocessing plant for high-level waste at Sellafield will get the go-ahead. Low-level waste, such as staff's contaminated overshoes and clothing, will continue to go to British Nuclear Fuels' present storage at Sellafield, they assume. The assumptions are controversial because plans for the proposed Nirex store below the ground at Sellafield have stalled and its costs are unknown. The government's Radioactive Waste Management Advisory Committee warned in its annual report last month that the timetable for opening this store was 'unrealistic' and that it might be difficult to get 'unequivocal evidence' that the geological conditions were suitable. The report also leaves open the thorny question of the timing of decommissioning. The NAO has assumed that reactors would be razed to greenfield sites within 100 years and fuel treatment plants within 50 years. But the industry wants to spread the costs over at least 135 years. That would need an extra step - building a concrete shell around a decommissioned plant while waiting for radioactivity levels to fall. The total costs would be higher, but when discounted to allow for the fact that the money would not be spent for years, the sum in today's money would be lower. On industry estimates, the delay could reduce the cost of decommissioning a Magnox reactor from Pounds 500m to Pounds 300m in today's money values. Observer, Page 19</p>

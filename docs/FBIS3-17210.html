			<p>Language: <F P=105> Belarusian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mikhail Rutkowski] </F>   [Excerpt] Businesslike friendly relations between the  Republic of Belarus and the United States in the military sphere  have been developing since 1992. Military specialists from the  Belarusian and U.S. sides are discussing the primary directions  of military cooperation, including such problems as conversion,  control over exporting radioactive materials, training of  servicemen, and creation of working groups for coordinating  military cooperation. Today, the honored U.S. visitor [Defense  Secretary Perry] was received by Belarusian Defense Minister  Pavel Kazlowski and Council of Ministers Chairman Vyacheslav  Kebich. In the afternoon, the defense secretary visited the  Belarusian Supreme Soviet. During William Perry's visit, U.S.  experts and managers of the largest industrial enterprises in  Belarus worked on the issues of conversion. First Deputy  Defense Minister Alyaksandr Tyshynski, leader of the working  group's Belarusian team announced the results of the joint  activities.    [Begin recording] [Tyshynski, in Russian] Esteemed U.S.  Minister [as heard] Perry, esteemed Pavel Pavlavych [Kazlowski]!  At today's meeting, we exchanged opinions on many aspects of  cooperation. We heard detailed reports by Mr. Barry Carter and  Mr. Pugachev, who is chief of the Defense Ministry  Scientific-Technical Committee. To many questions asked by the  representatives of industries.... [pauses] Today, one-third of  the largest enterprises are present here, those at which  conversion is beginning. Those are the Belarusian optics and  mechanical amalgamation Belomo headed by General Manager Hurski,  the production amalgamation of computing equipment headed by  General Manager Kharlap, and the production amalgamation  Integral headed by its Chief Engineer Kaloshin. We heard short  reports and answers to many questions asked by [words  indistinct] enterprises. It was interesting for the Belarusian  side to hear about the possibilities for expanding cooperation  in many other directions (?including) the Nunn-Lugar direction.  It would now be very important and appropriate to form a  committee for the conversion of defense industries that would  accelerate the implementation of those projects that have been  set up almost two years ago and will enable expansion of  conversion of [word indistinct] enterprises. Let me give the  floor to Belarusian Defense Minister Pavel Pavlavych Kazlowski.    [Kazlowski, in Russian] Esteemed defense minister,  gentlemen. I am happy to realize that between the Republic of  Belarus and the United States, between our armies and nations  stable businesslike relations are developing. The declaration  which we are going to sign on the principles of the Joint  Committee for Conversion of the Enterprises of Defense  Industries confirms the mutual [word indistinct] striving of the  sides for peace, and orienting the defense complex toward the  needs of a civilian society. The problems of conversion are  just one of the components of the developing cooperation, and  today, we talked about many elements of this cooperation. This  is a demonstration of peaceful trends inherent in our state.  The rather high activity of meetings and negotiations at  different levels between the Ministries of Defense is a  demonstration of mutual interest, necessity, and the long-range  nature of our relations. In its domestic policy, Belarus has  chosen the path of social peace and accord, and the development  of human rights and freedoms. Their priority character has been  certified by our Republic's legal acts. Belarus has proclaimed  its non-nuclear status, its striving to become a neutral state,  and is continuously and unconditionally observing its  commitments. We are grateful to you, Mr. Minister for your  understanding of the problems of the Belarusian people, your  readiness to cooperate and assistance in [words indistinct]. I  would like you to pass our best wishes of wealth, happiness, and  prosperity to the people and the President of the United States.  [end recording]    The ceremony of signing the agreement on principles of the  joint committee for conversion has started. The floor was then  given to U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry.

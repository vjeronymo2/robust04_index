			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Arts: A hard act to follow - It is almost exactly a year since Jacques Toubon took over from Jack Lang as French arts minister. Alice Rawsthorn reports on his progress On paper, he has one of the best jobs around. There is the office, one of the prettiest in Paris, set in the 18th century splendour of the Palais Royal. There is the avalanche of A-list invitations. And then there is the arts budget, one of the largest in Europe, with lots of charming Gallic artists to help to spend it. Yet when Jacques Toubon was appointed French arts minister after the conservatives' victory in last spring's elections, the problems of his new portfolio almost outweighed its attractions. The French recession was deepening. Edouard Balladur, the new premier, had told his ministers to trim their budgets and the arts, under past right-wing governments, had been a prime target for cuts. To make matters worse the new minister had a very hard act to follow. Jack Lang, his predecessor, was one of the most popular and powerful members of the socialist cabinet who, in nearly a decade at the arts ministry, had doubled its budget and spent it in spectacular style on the Grands Projets, his modern architectural monuments. His successor faced the unenviable task of trying to erase the Lang legacy and stamp his own personality over the arts scene at a time when expenditure was under attack. It is now almost exactly a year since Jacques Toubon moved into Jack Lang's old office. The new minister spent his first few months battling to save his budget from cuts: only to plunge headlong into the Gatt controversy as chef-de-combat of the Gallic assault against US 'cultural imperialism'. He is now dodging the jokes over his lobby to protect the French language from the encroaching anglicisms of franglais that has earned him a new nickname from France's satirists - Mr Allgood. 'It's certainly been an eventful year,' he says. 'We won the battle for the budget. It hasn't been cut and I'm very pleased about that. I'd count the Gatt campaign as another success. As for la loi Toubon, it is too soon to say. But when I hear them making those jokes about me on the radio at least I know that people are thinking about the issues.' The Gatt affray and the franglais affair have been interpreted rather differently outside France, where they confirmed the worst suspicions of the French as cultural chauvinists. But such slights have been overshadowed in France itself by the new minister's success at defending the arts budget, now frozen at FFr13.45bn for 1994. Toubon's achievement on the financial front is all the more laudable given his precarious position in the cabinet. Jack Lang had considerable clout among the socialists, as deputy prime minister and a confidant of President Francois Mitterrand. Jacques Toubon risked relegation to a secondary role in the Balladur administration as an ally of Jacques Chirac, the Paris mayor and head of the RPR party who is Balladur's arch-rival for the right-wing candidacy in next year's presidential elections. Whereas Balladur, who comes from a privileged background, represents the paternalistic strand of French conservatism, Jacques Toubon is a self-made man in the Chirac mould. He was born in Nice, the son of a casino croupier who worked his way up to become a manager. After swotting his way through the French education system, the young Toubon reached the Ecole Nationale de l'Administration, the breeding ground for France's political elite. Despite their differences Toubon has forged a rapport with Balladur. He has also won over the sceptics in the French arts community who, having dreaded the arrival of an axe-wielding conservative philistine at the arts ministry, have been impressed by his enthusiasm for his brief. His taste may not be quite as eclectic as that of Lang, who prided himself on his ability to rattle off the titles of the latest rap releases as well as lines from Rabelais. Toubon's interests run from 'old American movies' and '1960s and 1970s jazz', to modern drama 'Ionesco, Beckett and Pinter'. He is also a keen collector of contemporary art, aided and abetted by Lise, his second wife who has been dubbed 'Hillary' by the ministry's staff for her assiduous attendance at the A-list parties. Catholic taste and an affable manner, however, have not been quite enough to slay the ghost of Lang. Toubon's chief challenge is to define a new direction for French arts policy in the 1990s after the gauche glamour of the Grands Projets. Toubon sees populism as his main aim. 'Thirty years ago only 10 per cent of the French public participated in the arts,' he says. 'The percentage is still the same today - despite all the money that's been spent over the past decade. What's more they're the same sort of people. We've got to change that.' One strand of his strategy has been to improve the quality of cultural activity in the regions: by offering special grants for drama groups with touring companies and improving resources for music teaching in schools. But the dominant theme in his new policies - and the leitmotif of the Gatt and franglais campaigns - is conservation: a concept that fuses neatly with the avuncular culture of the Balladur regime and marks a stark contrast with the uncompromising modernism of Lang. Toubon has already unveiled renovation plans for some of Paris's dilapidated monuments: the opulent old Garnier opera house and the Pompidou arts centre, which was built in the early 1970s but is in dire need of repair after two decades of tourists trudging through it. The next candidates will be the crumbling churches and chateaux in the provinces followed by the Maisons de la Culture, the regional arts centres created by Andre Malraux, the French novelist who was De Gaulle's arts minister in the 1960s. 'We've got to get away from this idea of the arts being the preserve of the intellectual elite,' he says. 'It might seem more exciting to the avant-garde to talk about flinging up new buildings, rather than preserving churches and chateaux. But they're popular, they're accessible and they're part of our heritage. What's wrong with that?'</p>

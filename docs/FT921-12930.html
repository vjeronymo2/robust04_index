			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Half a million men sign up for Ukraine's army UKRAINIAN defence officials said yesterday they had made great advances towards creating their own army but had not yet settled several contentious issues over the division of the Black Sea Fleet. Lt-Gen Ivan Bizhan, the deputy minister of defence, said 270,000 soldiers had sworn allegiance to Ukraine, about a quarter of the 1.3m Soviet military personnel stationed in Ukraine. Another 240,000 officers and men of Ukrainian descent serving outside Ukraine had said they wanted to be moved to Ukraine. He said three meetings between Ukrainian and Commonwealth military authorities had largely resolved the prickly question of what constituted the strategic forces which should remain under Commonwealth control. The minister said that by 1994 all strategic nuclear weapons would be removed from Ukraine and no strategic Commonwealth forces would be stationed there. However, he said there had been no agreement on the division of the Black Sea fleet and there was still some dispute about parachute divisions, military academies, military sanatoriums and dachas and food supplies stored in Ukraine.</p>

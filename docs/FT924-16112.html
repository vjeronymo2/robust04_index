			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Hughes of US wins Dollars 258m Arab satellite contract HUGHES Communications International of the US, part of General Motors, yesterday won a Dollars 258m (Pounds 150.8m) Arab satellite contract, officials from the Arabsat consortium said. The decision is a blow to the two losers, British Aerospace and Aerospatiale of France. The contract was the only commercial deal left on BAe's prospective orders book, while Aerospatiale had won the previous Arabsat contract, still the only satellite built for a non-European buyer by a European supplier. The deal consolidates Hughes' position as the dominant supplier in the world satellite communications market. The company has about two thirds of the market and an order book worth about Dollars 3bn. Mr Saad bin Abdul-Aziz al-Bedna, Arabsat's director-general, said Hughes had won the contract after agreeing to lower its asking price to Dollars 258m from Dollars 267m and extend the operational life of the satellite to 15 years instead of 10. The Arabsat board had requested the price cut late on Tuesday, Hughes said. The two Arabsat-2 satellites will be used for telephony, TV and data communications. They are likely to be launched in the mid-1990s on the Ariane rocket made by the French-led European consortium Arianespace.</p>

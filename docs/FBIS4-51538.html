			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 25 KYODO -- Japan's exports to China  via the Sea of Japan swelled but its two-way trade with South  Korea slumped in 1993, the Japan External Trade Organization  (Jetro) said Monday [25 April].    Jetro said China-bound exports from 14 Japanese prefectures  facing the Japan sea jumped 36.5 percent in value to 106.5  billion yen last year due chiefly to strong demand for  Japanese-made machinery.    Imports from China which arrived in the 14 prefectures,  however, declined 4 percent to 162.0 billion yen as growing  domestic energy demand there resulted in fewer exports of crude  oil and petroleum products to Japan.    The Jetro report also said exports to and imports from South  Korea, the biggest trading partner for the 14 prefectures,  dropped 8.3 percent and 6.6 percent, respectively, reflecting  Japan's economic recession.    As a result, the regions' exports to four countries on the  other side of the sea -- China, South Korea, North Korea and  Russia -- increased a paltry 1.7 percent to 404.4 billion yen,  while their imports from these nations were down 4 percent to  697.7 billion yen.    Of the 14 prefectures, Fukuoka Prefecture in western Japan  is  the biggest exporter for the four countries, followed by  Yamaguchi Prefecture, also in western Japan, and Hokkaido.    Yamaguchi was atop the other 13 prefectures in terms of  value  of imports, trailed by Fukuoka and Hokkaido, according to Jetro.</p>

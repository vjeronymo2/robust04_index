			<p><P> November 20, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> CAVE-IN CLAIMS NO VICTIMS  </P> <P> Officials today found no victims at the site of a spectacular overnight cave-in  at a construction site four blocks from the White House that forced evacuation  of the adjacent building that houses United Press International.  </P> <P> "We don't think (anyone is there), but we just want to make sure," Fire  Department spokesman Ambrose Murphy said.  </P> <P> The sudden collapse swallowed several construction trailers, part of an  adjoining alley and a light pole. Witnesses said the accident caused an  explosion that lit the night sky.  </P> <P> UPI spokesman Milt Capps said the news service was able to restore service  quickly to its clients by switching some operations to other bureaus. For  example, he said, the Los Angeles bureau was temporarily filing the agency's  main domestic news wire.  </P></p>

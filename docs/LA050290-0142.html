			<p><P> May 2, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FASHION;  </P> <P> A SPECIAL REPORT: SPRING INTO FALL;  </P> <P> PACIFIC CURRENTS;  </P> <P> UNDER 5-FOOT-5;  </P> <P> DESIGNERS CREATE MORE STYLES IN THE SMALLEST OF THE SMALL SIZES TO GIVE PETITE  ASIAN-AMERICAN SHOPPERS A BETTER FIT  </P> <P> The petite fashion market, for women 5 feet, 4 inches tall and under, has  become one the busiest in the business. And local retailers say California's  ever-growing Asian-American population is a major factor.  </P> <P> In 1980, Asians composed about 6.1% of Los Angeles County's ethnic population;  in 1986, the figure rose to 8.6%, according to a University of Southern  California study, "A Human Mosaic," by David M. Heer and Pini Herman.  </P> <P> Many Asian women are 5-foot-4 and under, and retailers classify them as  petites. Stores that cater to the Asian woman who wears designer labels say  they have a clear sense of her priorities.  </P> <P> I. Magnin's Southern California stores cater to that clientele in virtually  every department, says Lily Taylor, vice president for the Southwestern region.  In addition to stocking a wealth of petite clothing, even furs, upscale  designer departments such as Chanel carry extra-small sizes 2 and 4 in some  stores. Taylor says the I. Magnin stores frequented by Asian women include  those in Newport Beach, Costa Mesa, Woodland Hills, Sherman Oaks, Palos Verdes  and La Jolla.  </P> <P> Asians also have had an impact on Robinson's petite departments, says Chris  Serafin, vice president and divisional merchandise manager of Pacesetter and  Petite Sportswear.  </P> <P> "Stores centered in Asian-populated areas have a stronger petite business than  neighborhoods that don't," says Serafin, citing Robinson's in Costa Mesa,  Westminster and Cerritos as examples. Among the most popular labels in  Robinson's petite departments: Liz Claiborne and Jones New York, especially its  suits and career looks.  </P> <P> Southern California has one of the largest petite markets in the country, says  Jo Lawley, senior vice president of marketing for The Broadway's Southern  California stores.  </P> <P> According to Sandy Altman, national petite sales manager for Ellen Tracy,  shipments sent to the firm's West Coast vendors contain a heavy concentration  of the smallest petite sizes. Other areas of the country receive a more  balanced, standard range of sizes.  </P> <P> While retailers are still learning about the needs and desires of their Asian  clientele, they have noted two main aspects of the fashion look Asian women  prefer. "Conservative styling is key, and a precision fit is paramount,"  Serafin says.  </P> <P> Avoiding alterations is what leads one customer, Donna Kato, to the petite  department. Kato, a Japanese-American journalist formerly based in Los Angeles,  has recently been traveling in Japan. She says she buys the bulk of her working  wardrobe in U.S. stores' petite departments.  </P> <P> She believes the influx of Asian-Americans has influenced the petite market.  Along with Los Angeles, she says, San Francisco is a good city for petite  shoppers.  </P> <P> Despite the expanded selection of smaller-size petite clothes here, many Asian  women believe there is room for improvement.  </P> <P> "There are more petite clothes around now than there was when I was in high  school," says Karen Nakakihara, a Size 2 who lives in Cerritos and works in the  Norwalk district attorney's office. "But the section should still be expanded."  </P> <P> "Finding dress clothes in my size is a pain," says Kim Chan, 20, a part-time  model and student at the University of California, Irvine. Chan, a Size 3, says  that when she finds a style she likes, it is either sold out, or is not  available in her size. Though she can order some things, it isn't always  possible. She hopes stores will continue to increase the number of tiny petite  sizes.  </P> <P> "I'm sure I must be competing with many other Asian petites who wear the same  sizes," sighs Chan, "but if I'm constantly looking for clothes, others like me  must be in need, too."  </P></p>

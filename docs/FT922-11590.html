			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (21): 'No results, no fee' for the investors' first-aider - Hindsight / Too many Fimbra members give bad advice, claims Toby Micklethwait, whose organisation tries to help savers who have lost money to pursue compensation TOBY MICKLETHWAIT's life changed when a friend of his lost Pounds 50,000 through dealing with a Fimbra member. Fimbra is the acronym for Financial Intermediaries, Managers and Brokers Regulatory Association - the regulatory body for independent financial advisers. A chartered accountant, who had been a finance director in business, Mr Micklethwait set about trying to obtain compensation for his friend. That led to the formation of the Association of Investors, a loose organisation which consists of professionals who are engaged in trying to help those fighting for compensation from the financial services industry, and the team leaders of groups of investors who have lost money. 'Our aims,' says Mr Micklethwait, 'are to see the quality of advice improve dramatically, and not be wrongly motivated; to ensure that compensation system operates quickly and fairly; and to see a reduction in the quantity of thefts.' Those who attended the association's first conference, in October 1991, included solicitors Alexander Tatham, Hewson Clark, Hodkinsons and J Keith Park; also the Consumers' Association, Age Concern, the Association of Lloyds Names, and Paul Cooper, a financial journalist who campaigns in this field. To earn a living, Mr Micklethwait asks for a percentage of the compensation received, and works on a 'no-results, no-fee' basis, rather like an American lawyer. The fee can vary between 10 and 30 per cent, depending on the prospects of achieving success. However, he says: 'This is not a race in which it is particularly pleasant to be the leader. Cash flow is a problem. It can take years to get a result.' A further difficulty can occur after compensation has been secured. Investors who readily agreed to pay a percentage when hope of compensation seemed small, may then turn round and say with hindsight: 'It wasn't so difficult.' Nevertheless, Mr Micklethwait says he believes that contingent fees are very advantageous. 'Many of these people have no money for legal fees, and cannot get legal aid,' he says. Questioned about how future problems for investors can be avoided, he is forthright: 'Fimbra is a very bad profession. There are no proper entry controls; no exams; anyone can become a member. It is very slow to throw people out. Far too many Fimbra members give very bad advice.' Most advisers are paid by the commission system, under which insurance companies reward intermediaries through a percentage of the premiums paid by the consumer. Mr Micklethwait thinks this system is unacceptable. 'Good advice does not mix with commission being paid by the supplier of the product.' he says. 'We must stop Fimbra members taking commission. 'We need a huge publicity campaign to make people very uncomfortable with the concept of free advice. SIB (the Securities and Investments Board), rather than sitting helplessly, could ask for money to mount a campaign. Fimbra and Lautro are not going to stop commissions on their own.' He doubts the efficacy of the various warning notes which regulators have placed in documentation. 'People can't go through life reading the small print.' The alternative system to commission is for the consumer to pay a fee to the adviser direct, based normally on an hourly rate for work done. Many advisers say that they cannot persuade consumers to pay a fee, and that they would go out of business without commissions. 'I don't care,' says Mr Micklethwait. 'It seems to me that accountants can handle the whole business of financial advice; they have exams and strict entry procedures.' What has the association achieved though its campaigning? Mr Micklethwait claims some successes, such as the Dale Greaves investors who had bought fake bonds. Many, but not all, have now been paid compensation. His original friend now has a fighting chance of repayment; the Fimbra member has been declared in default, the first step towards obtaining compensation. Another achievement is that a number of campaigners, including Mr Micklethwait, have succeeded in getting Aylesbury Associates declared in default. Aylesbury was one of many companies selling home-income plans, which have proved the bane of many elderly investors. The aim of these plans was to unlock the capital tied up in the homes of old people. The biggest problems have arisen with schemes which involved insurance bonds. In essence, the schemes involved the investors remortgaging their houses and using the proceeds of the loan to buy a bond. That bond was supposed to provide them with enough income to meet the interest payments and with further income on top. Rising house prices would, meanwhile, reduce the significance of the mortgage. Instead, the values of the bonds and of the houses fell. Interest rates rose and the income from the bonds could not keep up. The investors found their position steadily worsening, with the mortgage assuming a greater and greater proportion of their homes' value. Mr Micklethwait thinks that nearly all those who have been involved in what he calls 'home gambling' schemes will have to sell their homes. Half of those who entered an Aylesbury scheme already had a mortgage - that alone, says Mr Micklethwait, scuppers their financial positions. Many of those people who were involved in home-income plans are still fighting for compensation, and a number of victim support groups have been established. Although he says he obviously has a conflict of interest, Mr Micklethwait feels that those pursuing claims against financial companies should sign up with professionals such as himself. Clients need a great deal of help on day one, he says: often they have not heard of the investors' compensation scheme.

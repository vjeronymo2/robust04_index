Over the last four years, the Movement for Rights and  Freedoms [DPS] has successfully followed this tactic of  maneuvering, avoiding every hazard in its way. Those hazards  included the attacks of the nationalists, the Constitutional  Court doubts, the suspicion of the parliamentary forces, and the  mass media's critical attitude. Throughout that period, the DPS  succeeded in fulfilling, to a large extent, its election  promises without directly committing itself to the executive  power.    The situation in the DPS now is far from rosy. Its  commitment within the framework of the governmental mandate did  not bring anything positive to its voters and evoked the  inevitable struggle in the leadership, where mutual accusations  of cooperating with the State Security and participating in the  "revival process" were exchanged.    The meeting between Zhan Videnov and Filip Dimitrov created  a  sense of insecurity in the DPS on anything related to raising  the electoral threshold, something that could leave the party  outside the parliament.    Finally, the DPS also dissociated itself from President  Zhelev. Otherwise, it would not have been so concerned with the  creation of the notorious Military Office at the Presidency, and  Ahmed Dogan would not have missed the opportunity to participate  in the festive dinner in honor of Ms. Albright.    The DPS' isolation is increasing, and it could hardly be  called a "Splendid Isolation."</p>

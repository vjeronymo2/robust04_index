			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / County Hall plan angers Tory peer A former Tory leader of the Greater London Council protested yesterday against new plans for its former headquarters, County Hall, saying the building was in danger of being turned into 'an eastern bazaar'. Lord Plummer urged ministers at Lords question time to ensure that the redevelopment was carried out in accordance with its planning permission. The original proposals from the building's owners, the Japanese property company Shirayama, included provision - recently abandoned - for a 600-bedroom hotel. It is now planned to turn the building into a Pacific Asia centre. Lord Plummer, GLC leader from 1967-73, said: 'County Hall occupies a prime location in the heart of the capital and should not be allowed to lapse into an eastern bazaar.' Lord Inglewood, for the government, said it was for Lambeth council, not ministers, to ensure that the planning rules were observed. But he added that English Heritage was satisfied that the works accorded with the planning consents. Tory Lord Beloff said it would have been far better if the building had been taken over by the London School of Economics.</p>

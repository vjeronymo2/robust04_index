			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Capital Spending (17): Not so obscure objects of desire - Trunks There are some products which command a loyalty, a reverence which is out of all proportion to their usefulness. These are the ones that somewhere along the line have achieved cult status, that are recognised from Kuala Lumpur to Fifth Avenue, from San Francisco to Tokyo. Each has something to offer which is above and beyond any rational assessment of their worth. NOBODY buys a Louis Vuitton steamer trunk for sensible reasons. If all you are looking for is something to keep your belongings safe and dry, then there are a hundred cheaper, less exalted solutions. No, those who buy a steamer trunk are after more than a practical solution to luggage dilemmas: they are yearning for the golden age of the travelling classes, the years of the transatlantic steamers and the early days of motoring, when travellers were embarking on feats of derring-do. With your steamer trunk you, too, could be heading for Arabian deserts or the African bush, for with the trunk comes the invisible aura of all those long-gone travellers who would never have set off without one - the Empress Eugenie with her voluminous crinolines (they emerged without the tiniest crease) and the Congo explorer Savorgnan de Brazza for whom Vuitton made a trunk that opened into a bed. The steamer trunk was introduced in 1858 when Louis Vuitton saw the way travel was heading. Stage-coaches were doomed. Steamers and railways were the coming thing. Instead of the dome-shaped, cumbersome trunks so appropriate for stage-coaches, flat-topped trunks that could be stacked on top of each other would be much more practical. They are still made by hand. Each takes up to 60 hours; the inside is lined with padded cotton; craftsmen tap in the nails one by one; and all have a five-lever pick-proof brass lock invented by Vuitton in 1896. Today, even at between Pounds 4,200 and Pounds 13,000 a time they are as sought-after as ever. They don't always find their way on to aeroplanes or trains but sit happily at home, chic repositories of books and drinks - and dreams.</p>

The wagons, the first of its kind ever bought from China by  this South Asian country, were manufactured by the Beijing  February 7th rollingstock works, according to Wang Yanping,  marketing manager of the works.    The factory, a major wagons builder in China, has adopted  international standards in manufacturing these wagons valued  more than 2 million U.S. dollars, Wang said.    Local officials in charge of the matter said that the  introduction of the wagons will largely strengthen local  railways' cargo transporting capacity.    Bangladesh, suffering from traffic jams everywhere, is eager  to improve its railway network, and many foreign companies  including some from China are competing one another to enter the  potential market.    Besides cargo wagons, Bangladesh needs to import more  locomotives and passenger compartments.</p>

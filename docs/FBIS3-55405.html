Whether it will be the presidents of three or two  states who will affix their signatures to the documents,  however, is anybody's guess. Still, according to THE WASHINGTON  POST, "the United States, Russia, and Ukraine have stepped up  talks on dismantling Ukraine's nuclear potential in the hope of  signing a corresponding agreement in Moscow next week."  Intensive negotiations are under way in the U.S. capital  attended, aside from Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Georgiy  Mamedov, by his Ukrainian counterpart, Valeriy Shmarov.    Still, it seems unlikely that Leonid Kravchuk will arrive in  Moscow. Giving up nuclear missiles together with going hat in  hand to big brother would have become too good a trump card in  the hands of his domestic opponents, who would not miss an  opportunity to accuse the Ukrainian president of a lack of  "genuinely national thinking." Nonetheless, squandering a  chance to give himself a 60th birthday present of meeting with  the U.S. President would be unforgivable from a purely human  point of view. This is why reports that Kravchuk invited  Clinton to pay a visit to Kiev -- although, to all appearances,  the American side seems to be thinking that a trip to the U.S.  capital was quite enough for the Ukrainian president -- are  hardly credible.    It is well known that by giving up Belarus' nuclear  potential, Shushkevich earned warm thanks from the U.S. leader,  consequently Minsk has firmly reserved a slot on the itinerary  of Clinton's European tour. At the same time, being the CIS'  head office, it may just as well offer to play host to a summit  of the U.S. and Ukrainian Presidents. All the more so, because  in this event the meeting will be devoid of the "Moskal"  [derogatory Ukrainian word for "Russian"] accent. [passage  omitted]</p>

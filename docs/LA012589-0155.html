			<p><P> January 25, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> BENGAL KRUMRIE MAY RETURN IN JULY  </P> <P> Cincinnati Bengals nose tackle Tim Krumrie, who shattered his leg before a  national television audience during the Super Bowl, may be back with the team  when it begins practice in July, his surgeons said.  </P> <P> Krumrie, who underwent surgery Tuesday to pin the bones back together, broke  his left leg in three places in Sunday's game with the San Francisco 49ers.  </P> <P> Doctors inserted a rod into his tibia to stabilize it while it healed, said  hospital spokeswoman Gail Myers. The rod runs the length of the bone and is  being held in place with screws.  </P> <P> Krumrie will not need a cast, and team doctor Robert Heidt Jr. said he expects  to let him move his knee and ankle within a few days.  </P> <P> Krumrie broke his tibia in two places, and the smaller fibula, which runs down  the outside of the lower leg, in one.  </P> <P> Krumrie broke his leg while tackling 49ers running back Roger Craig. Krumrie  planted his left foot, and when Craig twisted around, Krumrie's body went with  him. His foot stayed planted, however, snapping both bones in his lower leg.  </P></p>

			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / Regulator seeks more connections: Andrew Adonis meets Oftel's chief as the organisation enters its second decade Oftel, the telecommunications regulator, is about to celebrate its 10th birthday. But Mr Don Cruickshank, its second director-general, believes its task of promoting competition in the UK's Pounds 15bn telecoms market is still in its infancy. He said in an interview yesterday that many of the central planks of the regulatory structure were up for review. Yet by no means all the reforms on his agenda, particularly his ideas for the future of the price cap on British Telecommunications, would harm the former state utility - which still commands about 85 per cent of UK telecoms spending a decade after abolition of its monopoly. Mr Cruickshank, a former director of Mr Richard Branson's Virgin Group, feels for the 'small guy' up against a former monopoly giant. He acknowledges that his job is to fix the nuts and bolts of a competitive telecoms regime, based on the foundations laid by Sir Bryan Carsberg, his predecessor. 'Apart from Mercury, new competitors are only beginning to make an impact,' Mr Cruickshank said. The policy framework was 'substantially right', but he had no doubt that the BT/Mercury duopoly until 1991 held up the process of establishing a fully competitive regime. The cornerstones of the regime are the prices competitors have to pay BT for using its network, and the price cap on BT's charges - which also largely dictates the prices charged by its competitors. Mr Cruickshank is open-minded on the future of both. The first - interconnection - is so arcane that it might as well be discussed in Latin. It comes down to two issues: Whether competitors should have to compensate BT for its losses its local network, caused by the fact BT's rental and connection charges do not cover the associated costs. The basis on which competitors should pay BT for inter-connection. Mercury is crying foul on both counts. Mr Cruickshank clearly regrets that it has taken Oftel to court. 'We mustn't allow (interconnection) issues to be determined in the courts - a recipe for the confusion.' He cited the US judge-created telecoms regime, where 'no-one - regulators or industry - knows what is or isn't allowed, and that is clearly hampering innovation and investment. They look with some envy at the way in which our framework is right and is not hampered by litigation.' Mr Cruickshank is, however, 'carefully considering' the case for changes and will publish a paper this autumn on the future of the interconnection regime. In particular, it is likely to deal with the future of 'access deficit contributions' - the payments to BT to which Mercury objects. He is examining the case for continuing to base the contributions on BT's fully allocated costs, rather than on marginal or incremental costs. He gives the car as an analogy - the number of times one weighs the fully allocated cost of a journey before taking it out of the garage are 'extremely few'. A change to marginal or incremental costs could make a big medium-term difference to costs faced by competitors. This autumn's paper will deal with other issues, including the future of BT's universal service obligation and the basis on which interconnection is charged. Amendments to BT's licence may be proposed, which could lead to a Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry if BT objects. Perhaps more important for BT is the future of the cap on its prices, which expires in 1997. Mr Cruickshank said that the 'favourite' remained a new version of the cap - which constrains BT's prices to a percentage increase lower than the rate of inflation. Two other options are on the table. The first is a cap on BT's network profits or prices - leaving BT, like other operators, unconstrained in fixing retail prices. The second option is for a hybrid arrangement, leaving BT free to price in sectors judged to be sufficiently competitive - such as international calls  -but restrained in less competitive fields. The latter two options are problematic. 'I am not satisfied that we in Oftel have sufficient understanding of market segmentation as yet,' Mr Cruickshank said. He believes that by 1996 the position might be different, and he is impressed by the degree to which BT has separated its network from its retail divisions in response to competition. The issue of European telecoms regulation is to the fore, with European Union-wide telephone competition set to become a reality by 1998. Mr Cruickshank said: 'What we need is Europe-wide agreement to key principles.' These were: Open licensing. Competing infrastructure, including at a local level. Interconnection to ensure non-discrimination. Independent regulators within each country. 'I would definitely not go further than that,' he said, although he sees a role for the European Commission's competition directorate in policing the telecoms market. Mr Cruickshank has no doubt that Oftel is here to stay. 'We will always be regulating and investigating the behaviour of dominant players.'</p>

			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / Private View: The diplomat who turned green A LITTLE versatility is admired. Too much arouses suspicion. But a person who is versatile intellectually is feared: which is why, no doubt, Sir Crispin Tickell, warden of Green College, Oxford, has been described by a Tory MP as an 'eco-terrorist'. Sir Crispin has been, among other things, Britain's ambassador to the United Nations and to Mexico, permanent secretary to the UK's overseas aid ministry and chef de cabinet to a European Commission president. He is an amateur climatologist and palaeohistorian. He is better known as a green propagandist who advises the British Prime Minister. The name of Sir Crispin's college is accidentally ecological. It comes from the benefactors, Cecil and Ida Green, founders of Texas Instruments. The heatwave was still in progress when I went to Green College in search of illumination about the UN Conference on Environment and Development, the Earth summit, in Rio de Janeiro next week. I asked Sir Crispin if he was (as MP Teresa Gorman had said) an eco-terrorist. His pale blue eyes narrowed. 'She's an absurd woman.' It is not only her, I said. You are often described in the Press as a doom-monger. 'Yes. Because I think it's easier to sell papers if you call someone a doomster. In fact I very carefully always put the other point of view. The truth is people like to hear prophecies of doom but suggestions as to what might be done are much less popular.' But you are a pessimist? 'It's very hard to be precise. I'm a pessimist about the ability of human beings to do very much about these problems in the short term. I'm an optimist in the sense that the needs are so great that people will do something before too long. You have said it takes a catastrophe before people act. 'Therefore one's best hope is that it's a very small catastrophe - the little earthquake in Chile, if you see what I mean.' He meant that accidents such as the 1988 drought in the US mid-West, which might or might not have anything to do with global warming, at least made governments sit up. What about the dreadful weather we have been having? Sir Crispin ignored this attempt at irony and explained that heatwaves and droughts could be ascribed to natural climatic variability. 'The truth is we don't fully understand how the climatic system works. We know in general terms. Little variations in it don't necessarily signify.' So people like yourself could be overstating the case. 'I would think so if I were only looking at climate. In fact I don't think the climate is the biggest environmental hazard. I think human multiplication is. So if I'm a doomster - I don't like that word, obviously  -it relates much more to the complex of environmental issues of which climate change is only one.' Crispin Tickell had the orthodox education of the British mandarin: scholarships to Westminster School and Oxford and a First in modern history. Like many of his public school generation, he was taught no science whatever. In his thirties he started to read physics and biology textbooks at bedtime. His interest in what he now calls 'the downside of the Industrial Revolution' really began with a year at Harvard in 1975. Instead of picking a subject he was familiar with he plumped for climatology. You wanted a hot potato? 'Yes. I chose in fact what looked like a cold political potato but turned out to be relatively hot.' I asked him why he started reading physics textbooks. 'I just found it so interesting.' He laughed. 'I think it's ridiculous. We live in a society in which we are wholly dependent on science and yet there are people who actually enjoy defying what in some respects is the most critical thing that's going on around us. Understanding is the least you can do, even if you aren't going to contribute.' While Tickell was at the UN, Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait forcing Tickell to postpone a trip to Montana in search of fossilised dinosaur eggs. I supposed his interest in the past gave him a longer perspective than most. Do you think about the end of the human race, for example? 'One of my less agreeable daydream-cum-nightmares is what would happen to the world if human beings were extinguished by some virus. I wonder how long it would take before the world would produce something comparable to ourselves - if it ever did. Sir Crispin was alive to the dangers of the Cuba missile crisis of 1963 but said he did not really believe in the nuclear holocaust. He seems more impressed by the possibility of an asteroid hitting the earth; in the 1960s he urged arms negotiators to ensure that an impact like the one in Siberia in 1908 would not be read as a nuclear attack. Are our leaders were competent to deal with climatic and population problems? 'I fear that the human mind is geared to the short term. Because I am experienced in the ways of the world I know how slow people are to take action. But when a new model of the world becomes imprinted in their minds, their action often accelerates.' Sir Crispin is alarmed by the lack of communication between scientists and politicians. He is creating a consultancy at his college to help turn the predictions of the former into action by the latter. Are scientists to blame for failing to explain that they can offer only probabilities, not certainties? 'That's quite true. They are reluctant to draw general conclusions from their ideas because they don't wish to be wrong. They are also bad at communicating their ideas in language everyone can understand.' Do you agree that politicians are not capable of making policy judgments because they are scientifically illiterate? 'I do. Politicians don't often understand the workings of science and think things are much more concrete than they are. They often don't have the fundamental intellectual training which enables them to make judgments. But they are not the short-term people they are often presented as being. They can recognise the importance of a long-term problem as well as anyone.' You think former ambassadors are better at it? 'I think former ambassadors can have a go because they often, like lawyers, have to reduce briefs to their bones.' Even if their own scientific training is . . . ? ' . . . is zero. Yes I think so. I wish that people were a bit more brave, and perhaps foolhardy, in venturing into subjects where they don't necessarily have all the professional qualifications.' You must be seen as the effortless mandarin, I said, the generalist with the first-class mind who's dabbling in areas where he shouldn't be going. 'That's what the experts would like to say, because experts defend their fields as trade unions defend the closed shop. But in fact I think we all agree it's very good to try and create a sort of bridge between these different disciplines. Of course it's dangerous for anyone who's outside the field to venture into it but I feel l can, having thought about climatology for 15 years. I think I know what the problems are. 'It's not that I claim to understand things better than others. It is that I'm sure the sort of thinking that goes on in science and technology should be part of everyone's heritage. So, far from being the sort of generalist you're talking about, I go back to a much earlier generalism, the kind that was favoured in the very beginning of the Renaissance when it was natural for Leonardo or Michelangelo to want to be interested in engineeering. It seems to me you can't be a whole person unless you're capable of being interested in a great many things.' What would constitute success at Rio, and what failure? 'What I think would constitute a success would be the building of foundations on which environmental action can later be taken.' That's rather vague, isn't it? 'Not as vague as you might think. A failure at Rio would be a failure to agree upon anything, a failure to recognise the gravity of the problem and a failure to recognise that something needs to be done.' 'If you turn what I have said into practical language it means this: if we can draw up a convention which consecrates a consensus and suggests what might be done in the future as the consensus takes more practical form, then I think that's success. 'I actually never believed that the Rio summit would emerge with a lot of specific agreements. But it has served a number of excellent purposes: to focus the minds of politicians and bureaucrats and their civil servants. It brings people up against the problems in rather a painful way. It will, I believe, put a consensus together.' Some might say you are a sort of socialist in disguise, that you're just anti-growth. Sir Crispin smiled. 'There are those who would call me an eco-terrorist and those who would accuse me of having sold out to the Establishment becaues I don't want instant changes that will turn our society upside down. 'When you say socialism, capitalism and all that, let me make myself perfectly clear. These terms have long ceased to have precise meaning. Every government sets the ground rules for the operation of the free market. I'm a believer in the role of the market in judging scarcities and in generating wealth. All I am really saying is: let the market operate, but change the ground rules. 'Then you mentioned growth. Growth and development are often confused. Growth to my mind means the accretion of existing resources whereas development means using the potentiality to increase wealth in much more diverse ways. Growth can be a good thing, but it can also be a very bad thing.' It sounds like we're going to have to make do with less. 'I prefer to say 'differently'. It's much more a question of changing living standards. It's also changing aspirations. If all the world was to live as Americans and Europeans do now, then we really are hellbent on disaster.' So it's a question of asking what wealth creation is all for? 'Yes it is. What's it for? And then you find a living standard which is sustainable for every generation.'</p>

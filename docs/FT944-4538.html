			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Counting cost of bankruptcy: Taxpayers will be angry at the officials who got the county into trouble and at the firms which profited The bankruptcy on Tuesday of California's Orange County is without parallel in the history of American local government. One of the wealthiest counties in the US, with a population of 2.6m and an annual budget of Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 961m), has been forced into default through a game of double or quits in the financial markets. In time, the outraged taxpayers of Orange County will want their revenge. It may extend not merely to the officials who lost Dollars 1.5bn of their money, but to the Wall Street firms which profited by helping them. The immediate effects on life in Orange County may be minor. Under the provisions of Chapter 9 - the type of bankruptcy applying to municipalities  -the county cannot pay outstanding bills to suppliers or back wages to its employees, at least until a reorganisation plan has been worked out over coming months. In the meantime, though, it can pay wages or other bills incurred since the bankruptcy. The longer-term effects are another matter. While in bankruptcy, the county cannot pay income on its bonds. Its credit in the bond markets is thus badly damaged. Even when it can re-enter the markets, it will have to pay more for its money. A hint of what this might mean came yesterday from the county's transportation authority, which has Dollars 1.1bn invested in the loss-making central fund. It has assembled a team of specialists 'to address debt service, payroll and other obligations'. Its planned mass transit programme, the authority said, should still be able to go ahead: 'However, it may not be on the same timetable.' The treasurer of the town of Huntington Beach, which has Dollars 69m invested in the fund, said yesterday that while the city should be able to maintain its police and fire services, it would put all non-essential spending on hold. Meanwhile, the financial markets are desperately grappling with the event's complexities. One central point is at issue: whether the banks that hold securities against Orange County's debts are constrained by its bankruptcy from selling them. The whole point of the bankruptcy was to stop holders of the county's reverse repurchase agreements from liquidating their positions. Yesterday some banks started selling anyway. If order can be restored, the Dollars 1.5bn loss so far reported on Orange County's Dollars 7.5bn fund may remain at least partly on paper. If all the banks join the stampede, the losses will be crystallised and very possibly increased. In that case, Orange County will be seen to have made a disastrous miscalculation. Bankruptcy was an extreme measure, which will greatly damage the county's financial reputation. If it did not even succeed in its object, it will have been worse than useless. Either way, Wall Street will not look good in the public eye. It is already being pointed out that the broker Merrill Lynch, in particular, was instrumental in helping county treasurer Mr Robert Citron play the markets. The company rebutted this vigorously yesterday. Chairman Daniel Tully said: 'We do not believe that we have any legal liability whatsoever, and we would vigorously contest any such action.' The firm could doubtless also argue that it is not its job to warn a client, merely to transact on his behalf. Whether that will carry weight in the heated aftermath of the Orange County fiasco remains to be seen.</p>

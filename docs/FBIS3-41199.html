			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Police Seize 100k of Heroin"] </F>   [Text] Milan, 3 Feb (ANSA) -- Milan police today seized one  quintal [100 kg] of pure heroin with a street value of close to  five million dollars and arrested a suspected 'Ndrangheta  organized crime figure to conclude an operation which began over  the year-end holiday period when the automobile owned by the  alleged courier was secretly fitted with an electronic tracking  device.    Police here, who worked with the Criminalpol branch and the  special narcotics squad, said Vincenzo Mobilio, 38, was stopped  today at a toll booth east of Milan leading off the Venice-Milan  expressway where they found 100k [kg] of uncut heroin in the  boot of his car. He had been under close surveillance since  Tuesday afternoon [1 February] when he left Milan for Venice.    The suspect is from a town in the southern Calabria region  and now lives in Milan with his wife and three children. He is  thought by investigators to be on the payroll of the  Calabria-based 'Ndrangheta.    A police spokesman said the heroin had been "professionally  packaged" in one-kilogram insulated bags "with a technique of  great precision, something new for us." The goods could have  been cut seven times, seven kilograms for retailing for each  kilogram of the Turkish-produced drug.    Milan Police Chief Achille Serra reported that the haul was  the biggest since November 1985 when a shipment of 114k [kg] was  seized here. He also explained that the wholesale price of this  type of heroin has doubled over the past year, to nearly 50,000  dollars per kilogram, because traffickers have been experiencing  increasing difficulty in laying hands on the Turkish goods.</p>

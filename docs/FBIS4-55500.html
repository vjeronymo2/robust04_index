			<p>BFN     [Text] In Warsaw today, Poland's and Sweden's defense  ministers, Piotr Kolodziejczyk and Anders Bjorck, signed an  intergovernment agreement on defense issues. It covers the  exchange of information, military training, and cooperation  between arms-manufacturing companies. Following the good  experience of collaboration between the Mesko Engineering Works  and the Swedish Bofors, both sides are hoping that Swedish  participation in modernizing our Iryda and Skorpion aircraft, as  well as military vehicles and warships, will be similarly  successful .    Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk referred to the fine  cooperation  traditions, especially from the interwar period.    [Begin Kolodziejczyk recording] Now we are going back to  renewing these traditions. This refers also, or perhaps above  all, to cooperation in the arms-manufacturing industry. Both  sides are interested in this cooperation--Sweden and Poland  equally. Our industry needs an injection of new technologies.  It will thus be able to make use of its far-from-negligible  intellectual and production potential. Sweden is agreeing to  partnerlike cooperation--that is, not to the selling and buying  of consumables but to investing their technologies in our  industries. I hope the cooperation is going to be mutually  beneficial. The first experiences, involving such well-known  companies as Bofors and Ericsson, are behind us. These  experiences were positive. [end recording]    [Announcer] Minister Andres Bjorck emphasized that Poland  was  the first postcommunist country with which Sweden has signed an  agreement on cooperation in the military field.    [Begin Bjorck recording, English with superimposed  translation into Polish] Poland is the first country of the  former Warsaw Treaty, and we had no doubts that that is how it  was going to be--first, because your country is leading in  making democratic changes in this part of the region, and,  second, both our countries, which are neighbors across the  Baltic, are interested in maintaining peace and stability in the  region. Sweden believes peace will not come by itself. It is  raising its spending for defense purposes that could serve our  cooperation. It is also important to give content to  Partnership for Peace, in which our countries are participating.  [end recording]    [Announcer] Andres Bjorck also expressed the hope that  Russia  would join Partnership for Peace and would not be guided by  particular interests.    The Swedish minister was received by President Lech Walesa  and Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak.</p>

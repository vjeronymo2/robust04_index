			<p>940415 FT  15 APR 94 / Survey of Turkey (12): On the last lap to a customs union - John Murray Brown assesses a move that will have a great impact on the country's economy After 20 years of fitful progress, Turkey and the European Union seem finally to have embarked on the last lap to a customs union. The visit to Ankara in early February of Sir Leon Brittan, the EU external affairs commissioner, has given a new momentum to the project. If all goes to plan, the trade barriers are scheduled to be lifted in 1995, marking the most important change in Turkey's business environment, and a further milestone in its bid for full EU membership. Considerable adjustment is required not just to Turkey's budget but also to the trade balance with the EU and to those sectors of industry most vulnerable to import competition. Implementing a customs union is difficult at the best of times, but Turkey is trying to do so with its own domestic economy in turmoil. Recent turbulence in Turkish currency markets has forced the government to devalue the lira by 12 per cent. Commission officials believe the crisis has made it all the more urgent that Turkey address the structural problems of its economy before lowering its guard to its EU competition. On many counts  -inflation, interest rates and the public sector deficit - Turkey diverges from the European norms. Some Turks wonder whether the attempt to integrate the country's economy with the EU is too ambitious. Nevertheless, Sir Leon asserts that customs union will have a stimulative effect. However, he warns that without underpinning the recent devaluation with an austerity programme, Turkey is in danger of dissipating the gains that might accrue from customs union. Turkey might make a better case for financial adjustment funds to help ease the process of economic integration. The Turks point out that they will be the only country to enter a customs union without first being a full member. As long as Greece continues to use its veto to block the flow of Ecus, Turkey could soon be 'the only country between the Straits of Gibraltar and the Sea of Japan not to get EC aid,' as one official once put it. Currently the only assistance available is under the EU's renovated Mediterranean policy, a regional assistance programme framed in the late 1980s less with Turkey in mind than to counter the growing threat of large-scale migration from the Maghreb countries of North Africa. Yet, despite the inevitable pain of transition to a more deregulated economy, Turkey's commitment to trade liberalisation has always been motivated more by political than economic imperatives. Unlike some of the Nordic countries, Turkey's political parties, with the exception of the Moslem-backed Refah or Welfare party, all support the objective of closer ties with Europe. Though Turkey's application for full EU membership was politely shelved in 1989, western officials believe there is little realistic prospect of accession in the foreseeable future. But Ankara is all too aware that any slip-up in its customs union timetable in 1995 would damage even those distant ambitions, at a time when Turkey is already losing ground to a queue of eastern and central European countries. In some sectors, convergence is already happening. In financial services, for example, Turkey has already adopted many of the EU banking directives. As the number of foreign companies setting up joint ventures with local partners picks up, national brand names are giving way to international products. Both Turkey and the EU have compelling reasons for seeing the negotiations through to a successful conclusion. For the EU, customs union will mark a further deepening of trade relations. Turkey is a dynamic regional trade hub. With a population of 60m, the country is already the EU's ninth largest export market. What is more, over the past decade the Turkish economy has enjoyed average growth of more than 6 per cent, higher than any member of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Last year, two-way trade exceeded Dollars 20bn. In Brussels, Turkey is viewed as a vital partner in the newly emerging economies of the Black Sea and central Asia. If there is to be a permanent solution to the Arab-Israeli dispute, then here too Turkey will play a big role, controlling as it does much of the region's vital water resources. The move to a customs union will not be easy. The World Bank, in an article in its Economic Review last year, suggested a customs union would 'have little beneficial effect on welfare'. The impact of trade reform seems certain to exacerbate the already wide disparities of income between Turkey's prosperous western seaboard and the poverty-stricken eastern provinces. The economic case for trade liberalisation is that it will stimulate efficiencies, deepen Turkey's industrial base and encourage foreign capital investment in sectors where Turkey has real comparative advantage, such as processed foods, retailing and light industries such as vehicle components. However, the exercise presents a big challenge for the Turkish economy. Treasury officials estimate that the move to lower tariffs could reduce tax revenues by as much as Dollars 3bn a year. As the barriers come down, imports are set to rise by a further Dollars 1.5bn to Dollars 2bn, adding to the trade account deficit, which in 1993 was already at a record Dollars 14bn. In the current financial environment, it has been hard for Turkish companies to make the sort of long-term investments in upgrading technology needed to weather the increased foreign competition. For foreign investors too, the customs union is forcing a rethink of strategies. Until now, most foreign companies have been attracted to Turkey because of the size of its market, its large population and, most important, because of the protection offered to an investor. With customs union, the market share of local producers is likely to come under pressure from imports. Moreover, until the government tackles the problem of inflation, which is as high as 70 per cent, and real interest costs of 30 per cent, the occasions where it pays to site plant in Turkey rather than to import will remain rare. Just to complete the administrative workload Turkey faces an awesome agenda. The urgency is underlined by the fact that all of this has to be completed by November, when a ministerial meeting of the Turkish-EU association council is due to set a final date for completion. Several problems remain to be ironed out. Further reductions are needed to arrive at a zero tariff for EU goods and the adoption of the common external tariff (CET) applied to all incoming goods - the fact which distinguishes a customs union from a free trade agreement. From a sample of 501 industrial items, the commission estimates that the effective protection levied against EU goods is still about 15 per cent. The Union, since 1973, has provided duty-free access for all Turkish industrial goods, except textiles which remain restricted by quota. There are issues in the political arena, too. Real doubts remain that the Turkish parliament, given its poor record of passing legislation, can meet the legislative timetable to bring trade and industrial policy into line with that of the EU on issues that range from intellectual property rights to competition and state aid policy. The commission insists that until the necessary legislation has been approved and actually implemented, the customs union will not be fully working. Both sides are giving renewed impetus to the process through the EU-Turkish parliamentary group - normally the forum for European attacks on Turkey's human rights record. But the main obstacle is likely to come from Turkey's large protected industries including cars and consumer electronics. Having prospered behind high tariff barriers for so long, these are understandably reluctant to lose their privileges and confront the cold blast of import competition. In the car industry - Turkey assembles locally-made Fiats and Renaults - protection levels are still around 30 per cent. A report commissioned by the car manufacturers' association suggested that Turkey would need another five years of protection to recover the cost of investments in new models now being undertaken, in expectation of the increased competition. Paradoxically, the threat to the car industry is not so much from EU imports as from eastern and central Europe, with the Czech Skoda and the Russian Lada already making inroads, and likely to penetrate further once the 10 per cent CET for cars from third countries is adopted. The commission's position is that if the car industry wins a delay in the timetable past 1995, then European textile manufacturers will almost certainly argue for the retention of quotas. 'What's sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander,' as Sir Leon Brittan put it. The narrow victory won by Mrs Tansu Ciller, the prime minister, in last month's local elections has given the government a breathing space. But the commission is certainly under no illusions as to the difficulties in bringing Turkey into a customs union.</p>

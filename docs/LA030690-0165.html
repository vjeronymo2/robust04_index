			<p><P> March 6, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MCMARTIN PROSECUTORS REFILE ONLY 8 UNDECIDED COUNTS AGAINST BUCKEY  </P> <P> Prosecutors in the once-massive McMartin Pre-School molestation trial refiled  only eight of the 13 remaining undecided counts against former teacher Ray  Buckey today.  </P> <P> "We are unable to proceed on those (other) counts," Deputy Dist. Atty. Pamela  Ann Ferrero said of the three molestation charges and one conspiracy count.  Only three of the five children tentatively scheduled to testify are willing to  go forward, prosecutors said.  </P> <P> Three girls -- including one new witness who did not testify at the first trial  of Buckey and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey -- are expected to take the  stand.  </P> <P> The Buckeys were acquitted in January of 52 molestation counts after a  three-year-long trial. But the jury deadlocked on 13 counts, all against Ray  Buckey. The jurors had leaned toward acquittal but were unable to agree. After  two weeks of public outcry, Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner decided  to retry Buckey.  </P> <P> Defense attorney Danny Davis filed a motion today asking that Reiner's office  be disqualified from handling the case, claiming that the decision to retry the  case was politically motivated and that Reiner is prejudiced against his  client.  </P> <P> "It is my conviction that we need an independent, impartial, neutral and  evenhanded evaluation of this case," he said. Society, not just the defense,  has become "a pawn" in the case, which has broken records for the length and  cost of the criminal proceeding.  </P> <P> Davis also asked Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Stanley Weisberg not to drop  one count which involved the boy whose allegations triggered the case nearly  seven years ago. He said the move would prevent him from presenting evidence  about the origins of the case.  </P> <P> The defense request "seems a bit strange," said Weisberg, who is replacing  Judge William R. Pounders as the trial judge. But he agreed to hear arguments  this afternoon. Davis has said that the boy also implicated his own father in  molestations and that his mother, who had a history of mental illness and  alcoholism, accused several others before her death in 1986.  </P> <P> Jury selection is scheduled to begin Friday.  </P> <P> The case began in 1983 with the arrest of Buckey. In early 1984 he and six  other teachers at his family's Manhattan Beach nursery school were charged with  hundreds of molestation counts and ordered to stand trial after a lengthy  preliminary hearing. Reiner, however, proceeded against only Buckey and his  mother, calling the evidence against the others "incredibly weak."  </P> <P> The new trial -- dramatically reduced in scope -- is expected to last about six  months.  </P></p>

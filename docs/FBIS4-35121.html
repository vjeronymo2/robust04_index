			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Beatriz Abreu and Sandra Sato] </F>   [Text] Brasilia, 27 Jun (AE) -- State-owned companies may  not grant real salary increases (above the inflation rate) or  salary advances during the "critical stage" of the  implementation of the new economic program. They will also have  to limit their investments to the revised ceiling of $7.6  billion established in this year's budget. Finance Minister  Rubens Ricupero and Planning Minister Beni Veras today  officially conveyed this decision to the officials of major  state-owned companies -- Petrobras [Brazilian Petroleum  Corporation], Eletrobras [Brazilian Electric Power Company,  Inc.], Telebras [Brazilian Telecommunications, Inc.], and the  Rio Doce Valley Company (CVRD). The two ministers have thus  defined the scope of action of these companies to prevent them  from jeopardizing the implementation of the real. Ricupero  said: "While state-owned companies are usually regarded as the  adversary, we would like them to have an active participation in  implementing the new plan."    Ricupero and Veras installed the Interministerial Board, a  body that will be charged with monitoring the expenditures of  state-owned companies. The board, which will be of a temporary  nature, will convene once a week to monitor spending by  state-owned companies. Today Veras presided over the first  meeting, at which he emphasized the need for state-owned  companies to control their expenditures so as not to hurt the  implementation of the economic plan. The most controversial  topic was the government's reaffirmation that President Itamar  Franco will veto any attempt at changing the investment ceiling  established in the budget.    Raul Jungmann, executive secretary of the Planning Ministry,  said: "If a state-owned company obtains a budget amendment to  increase its investments, the government will veto it." None of  the company officials uttered any complaint at the meeting.  Telebras President Adyr Silva avoided a direct criticism of the  government's restriction, but noted that he will have to spend  $2.5 billion just to fulfill President Franco's request to  expand private and public telephone lines. This amount alone  almost absorbs the total of $2.9 billion allocated for Telebras  this year.    The government is also concerned about negotiating with CVRD  the need to control its budget spending and the salaries of its  workers. The CVRD signed a management agreement with the  government whereby it has autonomy over its administration.  Speaking after the meeting, Jungmann said: "I am absolutely  convinced that the CVRD, as well as the other state-owned  companies, will comply with the revised budget allocations for  1994." The Special Secretariat for State Enterprises [Sest]  estimates that this year, CVRD will spend a maximum of $225  million; Petrobras, $2.1 billion; Telebras, $2.9 billion;  Eletrobras, $1.4 billion; ports, $187 million; Itaipu, $82  million; and other companies, $213 million.    The installation of the board opens a new stage in the  control of state-owned companies. A provisional measure  reorganizing Sest and transforming the Committee for the Control  of State Enterprises [CCE] into a council linked to Sest was  published today in the DIARIO OFICIAL. The old CCE no longer  exists, and Ledir de Paula Reis, former chief of the  International Reserves Operations Department, has been appointed  to head Sest.    As a result of the structural changes introduced to Sest and  CCE, the government has gained more power to control state-owned  companies. Jungmann notes that the former structure was based  on presidential decrees, while the current structure is based on  a law. Sest will now perform the role of the Department for  Coordination of State Enterprises. The former CCE, which in the  past was not linked to any organization, has now been placed  under the basic structure of the Planning Secretariat. The CCE  will consist of the finance and planning ministers, the Sest  secretary, and the secretary for economic policy of the Finance  Ministry. The two executive secretaries will no longer serve on  the CCE.</p>

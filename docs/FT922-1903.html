			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / Head of Guinness family dies at 55 LORD Iveagh, head of the Guinness brewing family, died in London yesterday aged 55 after a short illness. His death came three weeks after he left the Guinness board - leaving it for the first time without a descendant of Mr Arthur Guinness, who founded the Dublin stout brewery in 1759. He was chairman of the company from 1962 until 1986 when he was succeeded by Mr Ernest Saunders, later jailed for his part in the takeover of the Distillers drinks group. Lord Iveagh then became company president until last month, when he decided not to seek re-election to his position or to the board. Last night night Sir Anthony Tennant, Guinness chairman, said: 'I am very sad to have lost a valued friend and colleague, who gave Guinness tremendous service over very many years.' Lord Iveagh, known to his friends as Ben, had joined the board in 1958 as Viscount Elveden. The following year he became assistant managing director in charge of the Park Royal brewery in London. From 1960 his responsibility - still as assistant managing director - included Dublin as well as London. He succeeded to the Iveagh title, created in 1919, when his grandfather, the second earl, died in 1967. His father, then Viscount Elveden, was killed in action in 1945. The earldom passes to his elder son Viscount Elveden, 22. He leaves another son, Rory, 17, and two daughters, Lady Emma, 18, and Lady Louisa, 15.</p>

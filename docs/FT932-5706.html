			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Peruvian mine sale attracts keen international interest JULY'S SALE of one of Peru's prime copper deposits, Cerro Verde, is attracting keen interest from a variety of international mining concerns. By late May seven US, Canadian and Japanese companies had already visited the mine and plants while a total of 14 had pre-qualified to bid. Conditions for bidding should be published this week and the privatisation committee will announce a base price in late June. The slight delay has resulted from the need for a government decree assuming all Dollars 420m of the debts of Mineroperu - the state mining concern which owns Cerro Verde - prior to its sale. Cerro Verde is the first, and perhaps the most attractive, of Mineroperu's four production units - and its only operational mine - scheduled for auction in coming months. Last December, Anglo American bought for Dollars 12m through its Chilean subsidiary Mantos Blancos the unexploited copper deposit of Quellaveco, one of a number of Mineroperu concessions that have been extensively explored but, for lack of financing, never developed. Cerro Verde is a a different league, however. Constructed by Wright Engineers in association with British Smelter Construction, it was inaugurated in 1977. The mine's plant can - and did until 1984 - produce 33,000 tonnes of 99.97 per cent pure copper cathodes a year, treating oxide ores by pad leaching, solvent extraction and electrowinning. Oxides were largely exhausted by 1985. A small pilot concentrator plant with capacity for 3,000 tonnes a day was built to treat secondary sulphide ores, but financing for expansion was never forthcoming. Output has gradually declined as leaching of sulphides is inefficient. The deposit itself is perhaps one of the best documented in the world. On site, a huge warehouse holds 83,000 km of drill samples all boxed and labelled. 'The geologists from abroad who've visited are amazed and delighted,' says Mr Miguel Gomez, the mine's chief engineer. 'It's a treasure-house of information for the whole site.' The Cerro Verde ore body is huge, five km by 1.5 km (three miles by nearly one mile), and eventually the opencast pit could be larger than Chile's Chuquicamata. Proven reserves total almost 800m tonnes at 0.68 per cent copper at a 0.45 per cent cut-off - almost 50 years of raw material for a 40,000-tonnes-a-day concentrator. Mineroperu managers who, like Mr Mauro Serpa, have worked at Cerro Verde for 15 years or more welcome privatisation. Too often, expansion plans have been frustrated for lack of cash. Now, hopes for the projected Dollars 200m, concentrator plant hang on big names like Cyprus, Phelps Dodge, Mitsui or Marubeni, which have all made extended visits. Cerro Verde is located just 30 km outside Arequipa, one of Peru's loveliest and most civilised cities, while port facilities are only 100 km away. The mine has no need for the camp and ancillary facilities essential in remote mining areas. And the ground is fully prepared - pits and plants have been maintained with obvious pride and professionalism. Several hours away by road is another Mineroperu offer, the Ilo copper refinery. Built in 1975 by a Japanese consortium at a cost of Dollars 56m, the complex of anode, anodic sludge and electrolytic plants had design capacity to produce 150,000 tonnes a year of cathode copper. Ingenious shoestring modifications have pushed output up by about 20 per cent. In addition, useful quantities of gold, silver, selenium and nickel sulphate are recovered.</p>

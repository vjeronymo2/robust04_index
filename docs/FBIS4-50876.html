			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Jim Cheung] </F>   [Text] Governor Chris Patten flew to London last night  where he will consult the government on the possible setting-up  of an independent human rights commission in the territory.  China has pledged to disband such a body. During the week-long  visit, his third in five months, Mr Patten will also respond to  fears raised recently by the British parliament's Foreign  Affairs Committee over Hong Kong's future.    The row between Britain and China over a human rights  commission peaked earlier this month when Beijing's most senior  official in charge of the territory, Lu Ping, vowed to disband  any such commission after 1997. The Executive Council has  already had a broad discussion on the proposal and will make a  final decision next month, according to the Governor.    While in London, Mr Patten will meet Prime Minister John  Major, Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd and the minister with  special responsibility for Hong Kong, Alastair Goodlad. He will  once again press for UK citizenship to be granted to the wives  and widows of British ex-servicemen and ethnic minorities living  in the territory.    Meanwhile, Mr Patten has hit out at two former governors,  Lord MacLehose and Lord Wilson, who have criticised his  constitutional reforms for provoking confrontation with China in  the runup to 1997. The criticisms were made during a House of  Lords debate on Hong Kong on Wednesday [18 May] night.    Mr Patten accused the two men of being out of touch with  today's Hong Kong. "What may have been suitable and appropriate  in the 1970s, I am not sure is as appropriate in the 1990s," he  said. "This is a community which does have political  aspirations." He maintained his political reform had been  endorsed by the Foreign Affairs Committee and Britain's  political parties.    Mr Patten has also criticised some of the proposed  amendments  to the remainder of his political blueprint, which will be  debated in the Legislative Council next month. He said they  were contrary to the interests of the public. "We believe that  our bill is the best one...and is in the best interests of Hong  Kong."    Mr Patten said the government had not blocked independent  legislator Emily Lau's ambitious amendment for fully direct  elections in the Legislative Council, which was ruled out of  order by council President John Swaine on Thursday. During his  visit to Britain, the Governor will fulfil a number of  engagements, including addressing a parliamentary group on Hong  Kong and the Conservative Party's backbench committee on foreign  affairs. He will also meet Hong Kong communities living in the  northwest of England.</p>

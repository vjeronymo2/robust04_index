			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / Los Angeles repairs fabric but fails to heal wounds LOS ANGELES has wasted no time sweeping away the debris of the riots that racked the city nine months ago, leaving 42 dead and Dollars 1bn worth of damage. On almost every corner of Crenshaw Boulevard, running through a predominantly black district west of the city centre, shops were looted and burned during last spring's rioting. Today, many have reopened in newly constructed or refurbished premises. Other buildings are under construction, and even those plots where nothing is being done are tidied and neatly fenced. Many in Los Angeles express concern, however, that little has changed in their city, and also frustration that government at city, state and federal level has failed to respond to the challenge posed by riots on the scale seen last year. 'The Los Angeles riots were supposed to be a wake-up call. I am beginning to be afraid that people have put it on snooze control,' says Ms Dolly Gee, a labour lawyer active in the Asian-American community. Many Angelenos acknowledge a degree of tension as a second trial gets under way for the police officers whose acquittal last year on charges of assaulting Mr Rodney King sparked off the rioting, and the first cases resulting from the riots themselves also come to court. Relations between the city's African-American, Anglo, Latino and Asian-American communities are still often tense, with particular friction between blacks and Korean grocery store owners, who bore the brunt of last year's destruction. But there is also considerable irritation at a media portrait of inner Los Angeles as a powder keg waiting to explode once again as soon as the verdicts are returned in the police beating case, tried this time in a federal court. 'I am not prepared to say that tensions are rising. In fact, I think that generally speaking when you do have a riot a lot of energy is ventilated, and maybe you are not going to have a riot again in the same place,' says the Reverend James Lawson, pastor of the Holman United Methodist Church. The verdict in the second King trial, whether guilty or innocent, is unlikely to be greeted with as much surprise as the first acquittal, which appeared to fly in the face of the clear evidence of a videotape of the incident widely shown on television. However, many blacks in Los Angeles resent what they see as the contrast between the leniency accorded the police, and the much harsher treatment of the black youths accused of beating a white lorry driver during the riots whose trial is also getting under way. Many Angelenos, ordinary citizens as well as community activists and businessmen, express growing frustration at the lack of political leaders with any kind of vision, beyond short-term riot prevention, for a new Los Angeles equipped to deal with its variegated patterns of wealth, poverty, race and culture. 'We do feel government shouldn't abdicate its role, and to some extent it has,' said Mr Barry Sanders, a senior partner with the law firm of Latham &amp; Watkins and co-chair of Rebuild LA, a task force set up in the wake of the riots to try to bring economic development back to the city's more depressed areas. With no fewer than 52 candidates scrambling to take the place of retiring Mayor Tom Bradley, that vacuum seems unlikely to be filled in the near future.</p>

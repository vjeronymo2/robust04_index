			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, 31 Jan (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- An article  in the 87th edition of ZHONGHUA YINGCAI [CHINESE TALENT]  bimonthly, due out tomorrow, reveals for the first time the life  story and family background of Wu Jianmin, the ninth spokesman  of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs.    Born in 1939 in Chongqing, Sichuan, Wu was the son of a  driver. He moved to Nanjing with the family. His mother was a  housewife all her life, raising all of her eight children with  her own hands.    After graduating from Nanjing No. 2 secondary school in  1955,  Wu enrolled in the French Department of the Beijing Institute of  Foreign Languages, and was sent to Budapest by the Communist  Youth League Central Committee in 1961 as a French interpreter  for China's resident delegates at the World Youth Federation of  Democracy. He returned to the country in 1965.    Wu Jianmin spent one third of his more than 30-year  diplomatic career at the UN Headquarters in New York. Twice he  worked with China's permanent UN delegation, first in the early  seventies as the official in charge of the Middle East and  southern Africa affairs. During this period he was promoted from  3d secretary to 2d secretary. When the UN Assembly was in  session, Wu would represent China in various political panel  discussions. The second time was in the mid eighties, when he  worked as a political affairs attache.    In 1979, Wu Jianmin was transferred to the Chinese People's  Institute of Foreign Affairs to take charge of its European  affairs. His main duty, however, was in protocol work. Four  years later he returned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to  work at its political studies section.    His first "exposure" to the world occurred on 21 March 1991  at a Ministry of Foreign Affairs' routine weekly press  conference at the Beijing International Club. In the ensuing  two and a half years, until 21 October 1993, he presided over  122 press conferences.    Wu said being a spokesman was a "most challenging job."  "Each time he felt the enormous weight of responsibility," "for  sitting there on the podium represents the interests of our  country and countrymen." That is why each time he was "very  careful and serious, as if walking on thin ice..." People close  to Wu from the diplomatic circles described him as being able to  conduct himself very well at live press conferences, quick in  mind, and fast in reaction. Many foreign reporters give him a  thumbs-up for his brilliant performance. But Wu said: "I have  never been totally satisfied with any of my press conferences.  I always feel there is something to improve on."    Shi Yanhua, Wu Jianmin's wife, is now head of the Foreign  Affairs Ministry Translation Department. She graduated from the  English Department of the Beijing Institute of Foreign Languages  and was assigned to work at the Foreign Affairs Ministry  Education Office. In her 15-year career as a translator, Shi  participated in many party and state leaders' meetings with  foreign guests, and attended many important international  conferences as a member of the entourages of Deng Xiaoping, Li  Xiannian, and others during their visits. From the late  seventies and early eighties, Shi was the translator for Deng  Xiaoping in all his meetings with U.S. officials and political  leaders.    Wu Jianmin and Shi Yanhua have a daughter, who graduated  from  the Beijing Economics and Trade University and is working.</p>

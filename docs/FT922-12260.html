			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / The Queen's Awards 1992 (9): How the human ear copes with Wogan - British Broadcasting Corporation THE AWARD for developing the Nicam digital stereo sound system is the fifth to be won by the British Broadcasting Corporation's engineers. The Nicam system, already available to around three-quarters of the UK, allows the transmission of two high quality digital sound signals within the existing UHF television channel as well as the normal mono sound signal. The two extra signals can be used to provide stereophonic sound or even a dual-language service. The technology reduces the amount of digital information that has to be transmitted by sampling the stream of sound 1,000 times a second and cutting out unneeded information or frequencies that the human ear cannot cope with. The signal is conveyed on a new carrier using phase modulation and there is no interference with either the picture or the mono sound. The Nicam specification was accepted as the UK standard in 1986 and recommended by the European Broadcasting Union as the European standard for digital sound with television a year later. The standard is in use in other parts of the world - Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Spain, Belgium, New Zealand, Singapore and Hong Kong. But Germany has produced a rival non-digital standard. 'This award demonstrates the BBC's continuing continuing commitment to technical innovation,' Mr Marmaduke Hussey, chairman of the BBC, says. The origin of the Nicam work goes back to the 1960s when BBC engineers at the Kingswood Warren research centre were looking at how to deliver stereo sound to the FM transmitter network. The result is that compact disc quality sound is now available with television and the public are starting to buy the necessary reception equipment in growing numbers. Last year more than 900,000 Nicam stereo television sets were bought in the UK and around 550,000 Nicam video recorders. All the signs are that before too long digital stereo sound will simply be accepted as the normal sound standard for television programmes and recordings. Nicam was first developed to carry digital stereo sound for television in 1984 and was introduced experimentally on the BBC's transmitters at Crystal Palace in south London in the summer of 1986. The full service began at the end of August last year. Wogan holds the record for the longest running BBC Television stereo programme. It was first produced in stereo on August 11 1987. The first Queen's Award to BBC Engineering came as long ago as 1969 for creating a sophisticated system of standards conversion so that American television programmes could be easily coverted for showing on the UK's PAL television sets without loss of picture quality. In 1983 the BBC jointly won an award with the Independent Broadcasting Authority for the development of teletext. The award comes as the BBC is looking at every aspect of its future role in advance of the re-negotiation of its Royal Charter which runs out at the end of 1996. The task force on BBC technology identifies the impact of technical innovation on broadcasting as one of the key factors of which the BBC will have to take into account in the 1990s. It recommends the creation of a new Advanced Engineering Centre and a Technical Development Board, with strong programming representation to organise the BBC's future policy in the area. And, perhaps, also to win further Queen's Awards for Technological Achievement.</p>

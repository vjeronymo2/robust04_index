			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Ingenuity - The FT Engineering Review (11): The wheel at its heart - Case Study / Munters / A factory blaze in Sweden proved a blessing in disguise IN April 1991 fire destroyed virtually all the equipment at a factory in Tobo, Sweden, where Munters, part of the Incentive industrial group, makes rotor wheels for its dehumidifiers and related equipment. The blaze proved a blessing in disguise, says Mr Robin Howe, European regional president of Munters. The company's move from a labour-intensive manual method of making rotor wheels to a semi-automated process had gone badly wrong. The unique manufacturing process meant the whole production system had to be built from scratch. But, says Mr Howe: 'We moved too fast, and had a lot of technical problems with specialist equipment that we had to design ourselves.' Over five months, Munters rebuilt its factory production line, incorporating all the design change ideas that the previous year's experience had taught it. The system is now working, but Mr Howe is not yet satisfied. A new programme, Prod 93, has been introduced to address the perception that the factory still suffers from four problems: low product quality, high manufacturing costs and overheads, unreliable delivery service, and lack of customer orientation. The project covers everything from block optimisation - getting the most out of the rectangular blocks from which the wheels are cut - to personnel development but the objectives are clear: All products shall have perfect quality as specified beforehand and agreed by their customers - which more often than not are other Munters companies. Delivery precision will be 100 per cent, as defined by customers' demands. Accompanying these improvements will be a major reduction in raw materials, work in progress and in finished goods. The rotor wheel is the heart of Munters' dehumidifiers. Its honeycomb structure of tiny corrugations makes it possible to pack an enormous surface area into a relatively small volume, giving the wheel its high capacity for adsorbing moisture from the passing air stream. Consequently, understanding the need to get manufacturing of the rotor wheel right, by improving productivity and profit at Tobo, goes right to the top at Munters. 'The wheel is the key,' says Mr Anders Jagraeus, the company's hard-driving president. 'Our ambition is to drive the cost of the wheel down and to be the leader in wheel development.' Munters is world leader in dehumidification equipment, which accounts for about 70 per cent of its SKr1.25bn in annual revenues. But in the late 1980s it was in a fix: sales were rising but margins were being squeezed. The product range lacked coherence. 'We had a lot to learn,' says Mr Jagraeus, who took over in 1991. After a study last year by consultants from McKinsey, Munters has been reorganised to focus on the growth opportunities in dehumidification equipment and services, its two big markets. 'Our most important tasks were to standardise our products and reduce our costs,' says Mr Jagraeus. 'Gradually, we have grown more market-oriented and we are much more aggressive in the market place.' The refocusing has already begun to pay off. Heavy write-offs in 1991 produced substantial losses but last year Munters rebounded into profit. But continuous improvement is needed to offset the impact of recession. The Prod (for productivity) 93 plan at Tobo will build on what Mr Howe has already achieved since he took charge of the fragmented and disorganised dehumidification business area three years ago. Internal efficiency to reduce costs has combined with targeted marketing to boost sales. Manufacturing, which formerly took place in an unco-ordinated way at several sites in Europe, has been concentrated at two plants, with everything monitored from Huntingdon in the UK. Over the past two years, Tobo has reduced operating overheads by SKr5m. Lead times have been cut from 15-16 weeks under the old handmade process for rotor wheels to between three and four weeks. But Mr Howe's growth strategy for Europe will call for twice as much rotor wheel material in five years, from roughly the same manufacturing infrastructure as today - a few more people but no more equipment. This means a further halving of lead times. Working with the management team at Tobo-based Munters Component, Mr Howe set targets for improvements in four critical areas: quality, block optimisation, productivity and logistics. The aim is to double operating profits for rotor wheel manufacturing from this year to SKr10m by 1995. With only 22 people directly employed in rotor manufacture, - and that will fall to 18 or 19 - the key to the successful implementation of such targets is individual and team commitment. The target for block usage, for example, is already being exceeded because of one employee's dedication. Yield from each block has been increased from 65 to 78 per cent this year. Management meets employees every week to discuss the Prod 93 programme and its implementation, and a timetable for reaching the targets is checked every month. 'We've been a little too ambitious for this year,' says Mr Howe, but it was necessary to give the project a strong start. The last thing Mr Howe wants is to have to employ a third shift. Delivery precision has been 100 per cent for the last 16 weeks and purchased raw material prices have been reduced by 8 per cent since January due to more active procurement practices. The situation which the Tobo team envisages at the end of the process may seem a little Utopian - inventory and finished products, for example, will in principle not exist. Lead times will be so short and throughput so rapid that work in progress and finished goods stock will, in effect, be eliminated. It is early days yet, but the changes are crucial to the European growth strategy. Mr Howe sees much of the increase in rotor output going to new markets and applications. Throughout the factory improving quality, cost effectiveness and 'listening to the customer' must prevail.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 16 KYODO -- Japan considers it to be  "too early" for Russia to become a full member of the Group of  Seven (G-7) economic powers, Vice Foreign Minister Kunihiko  Saito said Monday [16 May].    Saito told a press conference that Tokyo considers it too  soon to include Russia in all discussions at G-7 summits because  Japan does not yet have a peace treaty with Russia and because  Russia still does not have the same status as other G-7 nations  despite its reform efforts.    Other G-7 nations also share the same view, Saito said.    Saito said, however, the "sherpa" or personal  representatives  of G-7 leaders, are currently discussing ways to hold dialogue  with Russia during the G-7 summit talks.    The prevailing view in the sherpa meeting is that it is  necessary to include Russia, at least partially, in discussions  on political topics to which Russia has some connections, such  as the problems in the former Yugoslavia, Middle East and  Eastern Europe, Saito said.    But the sherpas are negative on including Russia in  discussions on economic matters because although Russia is  making reform efforts, it is still a recipient of economic and  financial aid, he said.</p>

			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / OECD endorses Swiss policies Swiss authorities have been given a fairly strong - if grudging - endorsement from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development for their recent management of the Swiss economy. Switzerland is recovering from three years of mild recession and the OECD, in its latest annual assessment, forecasts 1.5 per cent real growth this year and 2.5 per cent next year with low inflation. But it predicts that a further round of public spending cuts and tax increases will be needed to eliminate a relatively high budget deficit, and 'stepped up' efforts should be made to liberalise many economic sectors and align standards with those of the EU.</p>

He cut off links  with Golboddin's militia and joined [words indistinct] in  Baghlan Province along with 500 people and 50 pieces of heavy  weapons. Mulla Abdurrahim, commander Abdol Wali, commander  Jalal, commander Mirza Rahim and commander Abdol Hanan are among  those who have joined the jihad. These commanders have severed  their links with Golboddin's militia and play their Islamic role  on the side of the Islamic army's forces and mojahedin in the  war of right against wrong. As many as 100 armed men of Unit  10 under the command of Mohammadollah Nader in Poza-e Eshan in  Baghlan Province have joined Jihadi Division 20. According to a  report by correspondent of Bakhtar Information Agency, the unit  was associated with Brigade 4 of the anti-Islamic Movement of  Kamal-Dostam militia. They have joined the Islamic army  voluntarily in order to take part in the crushing of the enemies  of Islam. Mohammadollah Nader, commander of the unit, in a  speech said: For the independence of the country and for jihad  and campaign against the enemies of Islam, Karmal, Dostam and  Golboddin, we are ready for self-sacrifice.

The minister remarked that this subject needs to be  explained  and clarified in detail in view of the conspiracies and intrigue  which the enemies of Iraq and Arabdom have woven around it.    The minister said: Let me begin by pointing out very briefly  that Resolution (687) was passed on 3 April 1991 after being  submitted by the henchmen of the imperialist powers. There were  16 drafts before the resolution was finally put to a vote. Some  12 member states voted for the resolution. Cuba, which was  daring and courageous, voted against it. Two other  non-permanent member states; Ecuador and Yemen, abstained. Some  member states, such as China and others, gave their vote for the  resolution, but they also explained their position on it and  contested some of its provisions.    The minister added: The resolution has a preamble and 34  operative paragraphs. It is a long, complicated resolution and  its operative paragraphs are purposely divided into 9 sections,  of which Section (C) is the axis. The leader president had  dealt with this section in his [13 March] speech. The  resolution was passed on 3 April, and on 6 April Iraq nofied the  Security Council of its frank and clear position on it in a  long, precise message based on the principles of international  law and the UN Charter. Iraq dealt with all those paragraphs,  explaining how they conflicted with the principles of  international law. Iraq concluded its message -- and it is  important that I mention this -- by citing the words of its then  Foreign Minister Professor Ahmad Husayn: "While recording these  principled, legal, and legitimate observations, Iraq appeals to  men of free conscience among the members of the international  community and world public opinion to understand the truth as it  is and to support justice as they should. Iraq has found itself  faced with one choice only, which is to accept this resolution."  We then requested that our message be distributed as a document  of the Security Council, and this was done.    The minister added: The purpose was to establish our legal  and legitimate position which was based on the UN Charter and  the principles of international law so that our rights would not  be lost even if we had to accept the resolution under the  existing circumstances.    Al-Sahhaf said: The second remark I would like to make --  and this is very important also -- is that on line three of its  preamble, Resolution (687) affirms the member states' commitment  to defending Iraq's sovereignty, territorial integrity, and  political independence. But no sooner had they mentioned this  sentence than they went about violating it in several paragraphs  of the same resolution. Several paragraphs conflict with this  basic principle on which international society is founded.    Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf pointed out that he had to make  this  remark so people will fully comprehend the unfair general  blockade which is being imposed on Iraq. The minister said:  Resolution (661), which was issued on 6 August 1990, explained  why the unjust blockade was imposed. It was imposed because  Iraq did not approve Resolution (660) which was issued on 2  August 1990. What does Resolution (660) say? Resolution (660)  has two paragraphs providing for Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait,  calling on Iraq and Kuwait to sit together to solve their  problems, and noting that the Security Council welcomed all  efforts being exerted, including those of the Arab League, to  achieve this aim.    The minister said: Later, Iraq approved all the resolutions;  namely, 660, 661, and so forth. Still, the Security Council did  not fulfill its obligations. So they came and drafted this  resolution [687], thus "swallowing up" all their previous  resolutions on the one hand, and producing new conditions and a  new situation which only exposes the real aims of the whole  aggression against Iraq.    The minister added: Everyone in our society must know how  matters were twisted at every stage and the purpose behind doing  so. Resolution (687) has 34 operative paragraphs. The preamble  refers to Iraq's political independence, sovereignty, and  territorial integrity only as a formality. The preamble also  includes certain principles which were carefully selected by  those who drafted the resolution in order to serve as a  background and a basis for the operative paragraphs which, in  themselves, are a gross violation of international law and the  UN Charter in particular.    The minister said: The key point of Resolution (687), to  which the leader president referred in his speech, is Section  (C). This section includes Paragraphs (7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and  13). Paragraph (14) is an explanation saying if Paragraphs 7-13  are applied successfully to Iraq, it would the beginning of  their application to the entire Middle East to turn it into a  zone free of weapons of mass destruction. They have not yet  done anything on this score.    The minister said: Regarding Section (C), which includes the  paragraphs I just mentioned, they said: We know that you Iraqis  have weapons of mass destruction. These weapons exist in the  following fields: the nuclear field, the chemical field, the  biological field, and the delivery systems field; that is  missiles. They also said: We have Paragraphs 7, 8, 9, 10, 11,  12, and 13 to apply and we will set up a UN Special Commission  for that. There is also the International Agency for Atomic  Energy, which specializes in these matters. The Special  Commission and the agency have been instructed to work out a  plan with you. You will tell them the weapons and missiles you  have. Teams from the Special Commission and the agency will  come to inspect them, and the existing arsenal will be  destroyed. We will inspect the sites where you manufactured and  installed the machines and plants which produce these weapons.  We will remove parts of these machines so that they would no  longer be able to produce chemical weapons or missiles with a  range of more than 150 km.    The minister added: They wanted us to reveal all that we had  and to destroy it. They wanted us to destroy the weapons, which  were banned under the provisions of this resolution, and also  the machines and factories connected with their production.  Once these steps were taken, Iraq would have nothing left and  would be in no position to produce anything.    The minister said: They said: But in order to make sure that  you Iraqis -- and we know you are a clever and dynamic people --  will not go back to producing these weapons, we will set up a  future monitoring system. They mentioned in Section (C) of  Resolution (687) that the monitoring system would last for one  year.    The minister said: Since they accepted the resolution, one  would presume that based their acceptance on the principles of  law, international relations, and the UN Charter, meaning,  first, that whatever they requested under Section (C) would not  prejudice Iraq's national sovereignty and independence, its  ability for development, and its right to self-determination,  which are basic for any society and country. We presumed that  our dealing began on the basis of the provisions and principles  I mentioned.    The minister added: We have been following Section (C) since  the cease-fire in 1991. The leader president said: Tell us  what you want so we can sit together, discuss it, and destroy  some machines and plants to make them unserviceable. And in  order to reassure everyone we will also set up a monitoring  system. This has been going on since 1991. We did more than we  promised. For the sake of precision and to prove to our people,  I will mention some of the documents which we deposited with the  United Nations and which are now considered documents of the  Security Council. They asked us to begin with the nuclear field  first, and we did. They said we want Iraq to announce its  commitment to the Nonproliferation Treaty, we said: Fine, we  have the following: six letters which were sent by the foreign  minister containing Iraq's adherence to the Treaty on the  Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons, 16 messages and statements  confirming that Iraq does not possess nuclear weapons and that  it does not produce these weapons or any substance that goes  into their production, 62 letters containing Iraqi declarations  on nuclear positions, and 23 nuclear teams. Then they said:  Tell us about the components of the Iraqi nuclear program. We  told them what we had: 547 tonnes of natural uranium [yuraniyum  tabi'i] and 50 kgs of highly enriched fuel. They took them and  transported them outside Iraq. We said also that we had 1,850  kgs of a fairly enriched uranium, 6 kgs of plutonium for  scientific research, and 6 tonnes of uranium waste. That was  all.    They carried out a thorough inspection. Then, they said:  We want to know the stages of your nuclear program. So, we  told them that our stages are as follows: Extraction of uranium  from ore and its transformation into uranium compounds. We have  electromagnetics, chemicals, and central [word indistinct]. All  this is for research. We also process fuels. This framework,  as you can see, is very normal. We have nuclear reactors we  bought from you. We have an electro-nuclear power project,  plants to retrieve depleted (wasted) nuclear fuel, and a plant  for the treatment of radioactive waste. We have scientific  research efforts that are connected to the program. Our  position is the same as that of any other nation or state that  is conducting research. It is all scientific research for use  in medicine and agriculture, as part of the development  programs. Finally, we have agricultural and medical  applications, to which we have already referred. Of course, we  have a nuclear safety system, nuclear safety measures, and the  engineering support for them.    The minister said: They saw and thoroughly inspected what we  had. Talks with [UN chief inspector] Ekeus began in July 1993.  They continued in September, October, and November of that year,  and in New York, as well. In his capacity as the representative  of the International Agency for Atomic Energy, he wrote -- we  have the document because it is a now Security Council document  -- saying: There are no more secrets in the Iraqi program. Iraq  has approved Resolution 715 concerning permanent monitoring. We  believe Iraq has fulfilled all its obligations.    The minister said: Regarding the chemical field, we followed  the same line. We told them what we have. I will mention some  figures, because we have them in our records and they are also  documented with the Security Council.    The minister continued: Some 12 large chemical inspection  teams came, under Paragraph 9 of Section C, to see the records,  visit the sites, and obtain samples. We detailed our stockpile:  10,780 pieces of missile hardware ['atad sawarikh] for 122-mm  missiles, 1,776 shells [qanbarah], 12,634 artillery shells, 30  al-Husayn missile warheads and 2,000 mortar shells. We said you  can visit the sites where this hardware is produced, and the  development laboratories, as well. They inspected them. Then  they asked: Where are the simple materials [al-mawad  al-basitah]? We told them that the stockpile of active  materials [al-mawad al-'awamil] is 280 tonnes, and the simple  materials stockpile is 75 tonnes. They asked to see the  canisters. We told them here are 45,000 canisters for 122-mm  missiles and 5,000 shells for 250-mm missiles, and here are the  24,000 that were destroyed in the bombing. They were all  destroyed in the bombing. They saw it all, including the scrap  metal. Then, they began inspecting. Later, they said: We want  to see the documents.    The minister added: We gave them the nuclear documents,  which totaled more than 60,000 pages. Then they asked for the  documents on chemical weapons. We told them they were destroyed  in the bombing. Then they told us: We want you to remember  everything and write it down on paper. Iraqi experts exerted  great efforts and wrote down everything in order to eliminate  any excuse. Ekeus wrote on a piece of paper: I find this to be  satisfactory, meeting all requirements. Ekeus then heard the  statements by the official in charge of the Iraqi and Gulf  Section in the U.S. State Department and by the U.S. National  Security Council adviser. He became suspicious after hearing  these statements, although we had a signed document between us  in which he said that what he saw was satisfactory and met all  requirements.    When he heard those people speaking in this way, he decided  that he wanted more information and that what we had given him  was not enough. Some 12 large chemical teams came. They left  nothing unearthed. They analyzed water and soil. They carried  out air inspections. They were very provocative, but the Iraqis  restrained themselves and remained very patient. The behavior  of the others was really bad and provocative.    The minister said: Iraq did not have anything in the  biological field. Actually, what we had was just scientific  research. We did not have any secrets. The so-called  reinforced microbes [mikrubat mujahhadah] were purchased from  the United States for purely scientific research, not for  biochemical weapons. Several experts came and saw them. Then  they said: We want to see the laboratories, even in those in  Iraqi universities. They also asked if there were any private  sector laboratories.    Regarding the missiles, we told them: This is what we have.  Here are the al-Husayn missiles. Here are the Scuds we got from  the Russians. We gave them details. During this period, they  brought in 21 teams, if not more, consisting of missile  specialists.    The minister said: The United States continued to play the  same tune, i.e., that Iraq hid some missiles. So, they launched  a new search campaign. I call it a search campaign, not an  inspection campaign. They brought in helicopters and gamma ray  spectrometers to discover what Iraq might have hidden  underground. They then toured the country. They stayed for  several weeks. The American lie was exposed.    The minister added: Finally, they asked for the records  about the disposal of missiles. We gave them the records. Then  they said: We want to see if these documents are original or  recent. They brought in a team to inspect the documents. Then  they said: The documents are original, but we will take them to  Europe for further inspection by more sensitive instruments,  although we are sure they are original. We will take them to  inspect them. We patiently said: Take them. Then we said:  Fine, we have covered all fields under Paragraphs 7, 8, 9, 10,  11, 12, and 13 of Section C. Nothing has been left uninspected.    I will now mention how far they have gone in their behavior.  They said: We want to go to the southern marshlands, because we  received information about possible leftover chemical weapons  that were used there. We said: This is very ridiculous. They  said: Still, we must go. We took them to the south. They wore  protective suits against chemical weapons. They were flat on  the ground while helicopters hovered over their heads. They  located an object stuck into ground. They walked over  cautiously, tied a rope round it, fearing it might explode.  When they pulled it out it turned out to be used mortar shell.  I still remember how some of them shook their heads shamefully,  and others said: These people -- meaning the Americans -- are  making a mockery of us.    The minister said: We knew right from the start that it was  an intentional thing. This was one of hundreds, if not  thousands, of examples that Iraqis have patiently endured since  1991.    The minister added: You may not have heard some of the  remarks made about the Ministry of Agriculture, which turned out  to be theatrical, since they did not find any of the things they  claimed were inside the Ministry. Actually, there was nothing  in the Ministry. But since they had nothing to say, they wrote  in their report: We found in one of the rooms "a scratch" on a  wall caused by a chair. Apparently, the employee using this  particular chair placed it against the wall, causing the  scratch. They said in the report: We saw the chair but its  back was not as high as the scratch. So, it was not the chair  that caused scratch. This means the chair that made the scratch  was replaced. They included that in the report as evidence.  The report was referred to the UN Security Council. You know  how tense relations were with the Security Council, which wanted  any justification in order to deceive the world about the  aggressive threats being made by peoples' hangmen.    The minister said: As you can see, I am only citing examples  and completely avoiding any personal comment. I dealt with this  person, Ekeus, right from the start. I recall that during our  meeting together during his last visit here in February 1994, we  asked him certain specific questions. I asked him: Why this  delay? What more is asked of us? We explained what we have.  You also know what we destroyed. I also gave you figures.  Then they said they wanted whatever we mentioned in writing.  They said: Actually, we saw the destroyed ammunition, and the  picture you presented to us was clear, but please remember  everything and put it down in writing. They wanted us to sit  down, remember everything, and commit it to writing. We had to  think and remember what happened in a certain month or a certain  year, what empty shell, magazine, or simple weapon was used, and  for what purpose.    The minister said: Iraqi technicians sat down and very  patiently searched their brains so as to eliminate any excuse.  They produced a full record for Ekeus. He was astonished by  the results. He said: What you have written down from memory is  sufficient and meets the purpose. We recorded it in our joint  minutes. But the Western henchmen said it was not enough. We  could not accept their haphazard remarks. We told Ekeus: Sit  down. You said the record was sufficient and met the purpose.  Therefore, this change in attitude is politically motivated in  order to prolong the blockade of Iraq. Some Western henchmen  say this is not enough. To be honest, most members in the  Security Council are against the extension of the blockade on  Iraq, because they have begun to see the irrefutable facts. But  the Americans are known for influencing and blackmailing others,  and Ekeus knows that. During the last meeting in February  regarding the monitoring, Gart [name as transliterated] produced  a chart and reminded me of Resolution 706, which provides for  exporting oil worth $1.6 billion. The world knows only that oil  is to be exported. But it does not know the traps and snares  inherent in this resolution designed to shackle Iraq. All these  traps and snares are actually intended to make us approve the  monitoring system details.    The minister said: Fine, you have worked out everything.  Ekeus said: Well, I cannot say that. I said: Fine, why don't  you find out? You have the Special Commission and the  experience. You have used everything, including espionage  aircraft. And now you say you do not know anything. How can  that be? He said: We do not have the capability. I said:  Fine, when the Americans wanted to support Iranian claims that  Iraq used chemical weapons in the Gulf, you made a big uproar.  A working team was immediately dispatched to the south. Fine,  let us talk about monitoring. Iraq and its people have been  very patient with you since 1991. Yet, you now say that you do  not have the capability. This is unacceptable. We ask you, in  fact, it is our right -- or, to be more precise, it is our  minimum right -- to work out a timetable to apply to what  remains, if you have something new to be monitored. Practically  speaking, the monitoring began in December 1993, it is in  progress, and the inspection cameras have been mounted at  missile sites and nuclear establishments. The inspection teams  also continue to operate in the factories. They even marked  some machines with tape, saying they must not be used. Ekeus  came to us saying: There are machines in some factories that  must not be used until the monitoring system has been installed.  So, he produced some tape and stuck it on the machines,  although they are ordinary commercial machines that the Iraqi  could have used for months. Tape was stuck on machines, cameras  were installed in two places, to inspect missile engines and in  the nuclear sector. Iraqi laboratories are under inspection and  all the monitoring measures have been taken, yet Ekeus comes and  says: But our capabilities are limited. This is an obvious  lie. Its purpose is to waste time and to continue the blockade  of the Iraqi people. We told Ekeus in February: This is our  minimum right. We have been patient with you until now.    The minister said: We said let us work out a timetable. He  evaded the subject. We pressed him. We held three meetings  that continued for hours. But he prevaricated like a fox in the  forest, as the leader president said. He said: We must have a  protocol, or a record, for each factory specifying the type of  monitoring being conducted in it. We should also set up logs.  Although this was completely unacceptable, we told him: Let it  be, although we are not 100-percent convinced that you have the  capability. We know what your capabilities are. We know what  the Americans have placed at your disposal. We ask you: How  many Iraqi engineers and experts do you want? Two hundred?  Take 200. They will help you accomplish your work quickly,  according to this timetable. As far as we are concerned, we  believe monitoring began in December 1993. Ekeus said: If I  agreed to that, they would say I was cooperating with the  Iraqis. What a weak excuse! So, he completely avoided  committing himself to a timetable, which is our minimum right.    The minister said: The announcement should have been made  in December 1993. But now that we are in this phase, let us  respond to the one who brought up the fabrication, although the  resolution clearly says that once Iraq has fulfilled its  obligations in these fields there can be nothing left against  it. It was Ekeus who came up with this prevarication. We do  not know where he got it from. Monitoring began in December  1993. The six-month period is a baseless fabrication. The  resolution itself, as we have heard, spoke of one year. The  leader president has proved this. The game has become only too  clear, not just to the politicians, but to any citizen,  observer, or anyone with an ordinary interest in this subject.  He can see very clearly that there is a treacherous game that  goes beyond this resolution. No matter what anyone might say,  this resolution violates the entire UN Charter and the  fundamentals of international law. The game has been completely  exposed. Ekeus wanted to maintain the blockade on Iraq, so he  looked for any excuse to avoid his obligations. That is quite  obvious.    The minister added: As soon as the inspection teams began  their work, we should have said that there was nothing left  unfavorable to our country. But the mean, mean game has  continued ever since. We have been very patient. I say this  because we have, indeed, been very patient; in fact, too  patient, about the enemy's own standards, assumptions, and  violations of our sovereignty. These people are aggressors who  resorted to any feeble excuse to implement the resolution their  way. All these steps could have taken in the spring of 1992,  but they wanted to continue injuring the Iraqi people, because  they are the only people who said "no" to the entire  imperialist-Zionist game. So, they have continued to play the  fox in the forest to this day. Even now, they insist on what  they are doing. I will mention some figures. You all recall  the U.S. spy David Kay. He fabricated a crisis. Therefore,  they issued Resolution 707, that included several paragraphs  violating Iraq's sovereignty and independence. I will cite some  of the provisions in this resolution. The provisions say the  inspection teams have the right to intercept any car, ship, or  plane; enter any house or place; storm any building; and  completely freeze Iraqi rights, even with regard to medicine.  Even isotopes needed for medicine were withheld from us. Yet,  they say all Security Council states uphold Iraq's sovereignty,  territorial integrity, and political independence.    The minister continued: They imposed the no-fly zone in the  South on 28 August. Before that, they imposed the no-fly zone  in the North. From 28 August to 31 December 1993, the Americans  violated Iraqi sovereignty, territorial integrity, and political  independence 25,534 times; that is more than 10 times daily.  There were days when there were 80 violations. This is in  addition to dropping flares on fields from low-flying aircraft.  Thousands of Iraqi women suffered abortions. Several diseases  were caused. Many people's interests were disrupted. This was  just during that period. But what did those who imposed this  situation do? What did those who included in the resolution the  sentence about member states upholding Iraq's independence,  territorial integrity, and political independence do? They  committed scores of violations daily. We have recorded  everything. They have all been documented with the United  Nations and even the Arab League. Let us now restrict our  discussion to the Security Council and Paragraph 22 of  Resolution 687, which represents the minimum Iraqi rights. As I  said, the picture now in the Security Council is as follows:  Those renegades who want continuation of the blockade on the  Iraqi people are a minority in the council. The majority in the  council, without mentioning names, call for the need to speed up  the implementation of Paragraph 22. The majority includes some  of the permanent members of the UN Security Council. They are  also a majority within the five big powers; in fact, three of  the big powers. What is taking place in the Security Council is  a reflection of the international situation. I believe that to  a large extent these changes are an expression of an  international awakening, albeit slowly, to the big plot planned  in the eighties and carried out against Iraq. The so-called new  world order was aimed at Iraq and the world. The changes taking  place in the Security Council are an expression of this  comparatively slow awakening. We might be able to expedite this  awakening.    The minister added: Tangible changes are definitely taking  place in the Security Council. The reason is that Iraq has  fulfilled all its obligations under this resolution, despite its  unfairness. The so-called new world order has also been  exposed. Iraqi blood was shed, but the Iraqis remained patient  all this time. When the evil directed against Iraq began to  affect others, the changes started. Everyone said: God help  the Iraqis and give them patience. Yes, when the spark of fire  began to reach others, they started asking questions: What is  going on? They could not stand it. What can we say about the  Iraqis who had to endure this for four years; who were hit by  the equivalent of seven nuclear bombs? Iraq will soon enter the  fourth year of the blockade. Indeed, the change has started.    The minister said: The leader president, may God preserve  him, spoke about the nature of the mission of Deputy Prime  Minister Tariq 'Aziz. I have just spoken about general climate  of this mission, which is very clear, documented, and founded on  a basis that any sensible and logical person can understand and  come to the same conclusion as the leader president, i.e., that  the game has been exposed and Iraq is only demanding its rights  under Paragraph 22; rights that should have been applied in the  spring of 1992. The international situation now -- actually the  change became evident in the last quarter of 1993 -- is very  different from what it was on 3 April 1991. The resoluton was  issued at an inadvertent moment in history, within the game, or  plot, of the so-called new world order. They tried to establish  something that conflicted with the nature of things in all parts  of the world. So, their plans were deadlocked in 1992 and 1993  and began to be exposed after the last quarter of 1993.    The minister explained: The international atmosphere now is  clearly in favor of Iraqi rights. This inclination exists in  the Security Council. As I said, the majority in the Security  Council are demanding implementation of Paragraph 22. Their  conscience is burdened by the Iraqi people's sufferings as a  result of this despicable crime committed against them since the  imposition of the blockade; in fact, since the issuance of  Resolution 661 on 6 August 1990. The majority is making  demands. There are divisions in the minority and even inside  the United States itself.    The minister said: Actually, a significant debate took  place within one of the subcommittees of the Congressional  Foreign Relations Committee. The debate was between Committee  Chairman Lee Hamilton, a Democrat and a Clinton supporter, and  Assistant Secretary of State Pelletreau. The latter was U.S.  ambassador to Tunisia during the initial contacts with the PLO.  He was then transferred to the State Department. Pelletreau  was summoned to testify before the committee. Hamilton himself  put the questions to Pelletreau. He asked him: Tell me, what  do you want from Iraq? Pelletreau tried to dodge the question,  but Hamilton kept coming back with the same question, saying:  You are not making it clear to me. I want you to say exactly  what you want from Iraq. What is it that Iraq has not fulfilled  and must fulfill before the blockade is lifted? Pelletreau  replied: I believe it will be wise if I do not answer your  question. The question was repeated ten times, but Pelletreau  remained evasive. Hamilton then told him: Go now and come back  after one or two weeks with a written reply.    The minister said: This shows that even inside the enemy map  the atmosphere is no longer the same as the one they fabricated  and presented in 1991. Yes, the situation is changing and will  continue to change. We have all seen how world nations changed  their attitude when spark from the fire that hit Iraq and the  Iraqi people began reaching them. They stood up and said: This  is unacceptable.    The foreign minister said: Iraqi rights will definitely be  achieved. The arguments, evidence, and documents we have just  outlined will silence the largest of them. Who will continue to  be stubborn once he has been exposed? I believe justice will  prevail and that Iraqi rights will triumph. No one has been as  patient as the Iraqi people. No one has withstood such a savage  onslaught as our people. I believe our people will remain  steadfast until they hold final victory in their hand and regain  their rights, God willing.    [Badawi] Are there any other implicit conditions set by the  United States before lifting the blockade on Iraq, even  partially? Are there conditions related to Iraq's internal  situation?    [Salih] The resolution itself does not include any  conditions, except those I have just mentioned, i.e., the  application of the clauses related to Iraq. But outside the  resolution, there are proposals. Yes, there are proposals,  including, for example, the issue of human rights and respect  for human rights. The issue is completely reversed. It is not  the Government of Iraq that violates human rights. It is the  U.S. Government and some officials in the United States and  Britain that violate human rights in Iraq. They are interfering  in Iraq's domestic affairs in violation of the UN Charter. They  imposed two no-fly zones on the official forces, apart from the  Security Council's resolutions. There is no Security Council  resolution in this regard. These pretexts have become weak.  These justifications are unfounded.    [Badawi] Mr. Sa'di Mahdi Salih, it has been noticed that  differences surfaced during the recent Security Council debate  on Iraq, especially among France, Russia, and the PRC on one  hand and the United State and Britain on the other, and on the  position to be adopted regarding the assessment of Iraq's  efforts to handle and respond to the international resolutions.  The Security Council's members differed. They were unable to  agree on a statement praising Iraq, for example, for making  progress regarding disarmament. How do you assess and interpret  these differences, as well as the French, Russian, and PRC  positions?    [Salih] The facts at present have imposed those differences  because it is wrong to renew the blockade automatically and  without any discussion or without considering Iraq's measures to  implement the relevant Security Council resolutions. Here, any  objective and fair person will certainly raise his voice and  call for a pause to discuss the reason why they decide  automatically, without discussion. Raising such a question will  lead to differences between the two sides, because some want to  renew the sanctions without giving convincing reasons and others  call for discussing and seeing if the reasons that made them  impose the blockade on Iraq are still there. The answer will  be: No, none of the reasons are there. Therefore, there will  be a demand for lifting the blockade. So, the United States and  Britain are trying to prevent such a trend.    [Badawi] There have been Iraqi threats to take some certain  measure if a settlement was not reached regarding the oil  embargo on Baghdad, but Tariq 'Aziz did not disclose the nature  of that measure. What do you mean by a certain measure,  especially since your demand for lifting the oil embargo was not  met?    [Salih] Let us ask any world state, whose people are placed  under a comprehensive and firm blockade for four years, what it  would do when it sees its people dying slowly in a genocide-like  situation, when its officials and doctors see children dying  before their eyes without being able to do anything because they  do not have medicine, and when it sees its people hungry and  their health affected. What would that state do in such a case?  It will take measures to protect the people. We should not go  too far to hint that we will launch a new war. No, we will do  our utmost to lift that blockade. Our forefathers said:  Poverty amounts to infidelity. When people starve and are  naked, they have the right to do everything.    If we have managed to restrain our people and prevent them  from doing things that violate the international will, or can be  considered a departure from the prevailing concepts, then I  believe that if our people do something in the future, we will  not be able to tell to them stop, as we did and continue to do.    [Badawi] In other words, is it possible to expect a popular  Iraqi move?    [Salih] I cannot define a certain formula. This might happen  on the spur of the moment. I cannot now define the formula by  which we will respond to the injustice our people have suffered.  However, the wronged have the right to do anything.    [Badawi] There is also the question of recognizing Kuwait,  which was raised again during the debates. Tariq 'Aziz promised  that if the embargo against Iraq is lifted, then Baghdad might  reconsider its stand on Kuwait.    [Salih] In case the embargo is lifted, then everything can  be  discussed. Tariq 'Aziz's answer was clear. I have nothing to  add to that answer.    [Badawi] How can the question of reconsidering the issue of  Kuwait be interpreted? A final recognition of borders, for  example?    [Salih] Until 2 August 1990, we considered Kuwait a state.  We dealt with Amir Jabir as a head of state. During his  meetings with Amir Jabir, President Saddam Husayn dealt with him  as such. Therefore, when we accepted Resolution 660, I think  that implicitly meant recognition. But, if we are asked, after  all that happened to our people, to be lenient to our people's  enemies -- who insist on harming us -- of course, this puts us  in an embarrassing position. What will we tell our citizens if  we keep silent when we see them or their family members die or  get sick without finding medicine? What will we tell him? What  will we do?    [Badawi] Mr. Sa'di Mahdi Salih, you are taking part in the  Interparliamentary Union [IPU] meeting in Paris. In accordance  with an IPU spokesman, a proposal to discuss a request to lift  the economic sanctions against Iraq has been rejected. In your  view, does this stand reflect the support of most international  parliamentarians for the continued sanctions against Baghdad?    [Salih] After the disappearance of the role of the former  Soviet Union, the world now is controlled by a sole superpower,  the United States. Therefore, all that is prevailing in  international politics does not reflect the true state of  affairs. Some fear for their interests, and some even fear  their own safety. Therefore, the real stands are unclear now.  Yet, there is broad international sympathy for the Iraqi  people. This is because the issue is a human issue. Besides,  the proposal was an extra item. It was not a basic item.  Therefore, it could be that...    [Badawi, interrupting] Yes, but it was rejected. Does this  reflect a certain orientation, or are your contacts...    [Salih, interrupting] No, I do not think it reflects  reality.  For the first time, the proposal was put to the vote on the  first day, while such a thing would usually happen three or four  days after the opening of the conference. Of course, this seems  to be a game by the presidency of the conference.    [Badawi] The presidency of the conference?    [Salih] The traditional presidency of the conference. I do  not mean the French. The president, I believe, is British.    [Badawi] Contacts were recently noted between Baghdad and  France, Russia, and even Turkey. Turkish President Demirel  recently called for either toppling the Baghdad regime or  permitting Ankara to play a role or embark on meditation between  the Iraqi Government and the Kurds. What is your comment on  this talk?    [Salih] We and Turkey are linked by old and broad relations.  However, the Iraqi-Turkish relationship was affected by the Gulf  war. As was the case with several other states, Turkey  sustained much damage as a result of the blockade. We  understand what Demirel meant. Demirel meant to say: Enough.  You are wagering on the possibility that the Iraqi regime will  fall due to the continued blockade, but this lengthy blockade  has resulted in nothing to this effect, so you should lift the  blockade.    [Badawi] Mr. Sa'di Mahdi Salih: The Turkish position was  accompanied by information about Iraqi troop concentrations in  northern Iraq and a plan to reopen the northern road leading to  Turkey. Is this true?    [Salih] I have no such information.    [Badawi] Is there not an intention to reopen the Baghdad-  Ankara road in order to facilitate exchanges, export, or  import...    [Salih, interrupting] The Baghdad-Ankara road would have  been open if hadn't been for the Hammer Force and for the U.S.  and British interference that prevented free movement. This  road is passable. There are no obstacles on it.    [Badawi] But, at present, this road lies in the Kurdish  region ...    [Salih, interrupting] I believe, however, that if there was  approval of movement, such movement would take place.    [Badawi] So, an international green light is awaited.    [Salih] Yes, we are awaiting the departure of the Hammer  Force. It is illegitimate. This force represents flagrant  interference in the affairs of an independent state and a UN  member state.    [Badawi] Within this context, Mas'ud Barzani has accused the  Iraqi authorities of taking revenge on the Kurds for the  extension of the economic embargo on Baghdad by halting fuel  supplies to the Kurds.    [Salih] Iraq is besieged. We told you we suffer much due to  this blockade, in many forms, including food, medicine, and  fuel. There is strict rationing of all these materials. The  Kurds receive their rations. But, if the Kurds compare their  rations to the pre- war period, the rations will naturally seem  very small. However, this is the ration Iraq can provide at  this time. When the blockade of Iraq is lifted, you will find  that the blockade on the Kurds will consequently and  simultaneously be lifted.    [Badawi] Hence, this measure is linked to ...    [Salih, interrupting] It is linked to the main blockade [on  Iraq].    [Badawi] So, Barzani is right.    [Salih] No, he is not right, because he accuses the Iraqi  Government. But where can the Iraqi Government get additional  rations? It cannot give to a Kurd twice the ration of an Arab.  It gives the Kurd the ration mentioned in the ration card. We  are not responsible for the Kurds' failure to control the  disbursement and delivery process because we do not have any  employees there. As a result of the interference in our  internal affairs, we do not have any authority in that region.  We deliver the supplies to certain points, and they receive  them. If they do not deliver the supplies, it is their own  responsibility. If they sell fuel to Iran for hard currency and  dispose of fuel as individuals, it is their own responsibility.    [Badawi] It is reported that Iraqi oil is being exported to  Pakistan and Afghanistan via Iran. How true is this?    [Salih, laughing] How can oil be exported across borders?  You know oil is exported in pipelines and requires large  investments before this can take place. This is not available  at present.    [Badawi] Then, these reports are incorrect.    [Salih] Yes, incorrect.    [Badawi] Regarding the domestic situation, the opposition is  talking about the expansion and exacerbation of tension,  particularly on the security level, in Baghdad and elsewhere in  Iraq.    [Salih] My answer to such utterances is that we welcome  anyone, even the one who calls himself the opposition, who wants  to find out or be sure of the true situation. The country is  opening its doors to all -- to newsmen, politicians, and  parliamentarians -- to see for themselves in full freedom and to  become closely acquainted with the situation. I can say in  advance that they will discover that what they said was wrong  and does not represent the truth. Security is prevailing all  over Iraq, except for the area outside state authority, which is  called the Kurdish area. This area consists of the three  Governorates of Dahuk, Irbil, and al-Sulaymaniyah.    [Badawi] What about the situation in the south?    [Salih] The situation in the south is no different from the  situation in Baghdad. Both are the same. Stability is complete  and overwhelming.    [Badawi] Mr. Sa'di Mahdi Salih: In the aftermath of the  second Gulf war, promises were made that there would be reforms  on the political level, toward democracy, pluralism, and so  forth. Negotiations and dialogues were held with the Kurds.  Afterward, we heard nothing in this regard. How long will the  suspension of dialogue between authority and other political  factions, including the opposition and others, continue?    [Salih] We embarked on what you termed political reform at  the end of the war with Iran. We were expecting to implement  all that was required by the end of 1990. This included the  endorsement of a new constitution for the country through a  referendum and the election of a National Assembly, a Shura  Council, and the president of the state. These steps were  expected to be taken at that stage. However, things happened.  Now, the situation of Iraq is as follows: It is besieged. Part  of its territory is in one way or another under the control of  international forces, particularly the United States and  Britain. Accordingly, these steps are now suspended, but not  forever. We will implement them as soon as the present  extraordinary circumstances come to a conclusion. Still, the  National Assembly discussed and ratified a new party law, which  is currently valid. Any Iraqis wishing to engage in politics,  in Iraq or abroad, can apply according to this law. Thus, this  is a pledge that was not imposed on us but stems from our creed,  from our conviction that democracy is the right path to run the  affairs of our country.    [Badawi] What about the federation proposal called for by  the  opposition factions as a final solution for the Iraqi issue?    [Salih] I think there was an answer that was also proposed  during the dialogue: There is nothing beyond autonomy. We will  not accept a formula beyond autonomy. We believe this autonomy  fulfills the aspirations and demands of the Kurdish sons of our  people. These people enjoyed these rights before their brothers  in other countries -- Turkey, Syria, and Iran -- did. These  countries did not give the Kurds what Iraq gave them. But it is  the game of politics. Iraq wants to build a progressive,  developed, and cultural system with a sound scientific method.  Some international powers, however, do not want this.  Therefore, problems are created. This is one of the problems  that were first created by Britain and now pursued by the United  States, to keep Iraq weak and backward.    [Badawi] A last word about the future. How do you view it  from besieged Baghdad?    [Salih] The future is for Iraq. The present circumstances  are extraordinary and temporary. The day will come when the  world will discover it has wronged Iraq. Many will come to help  Iraq continue its march because it pursues a sound course. The  whole question is that we do not want anyone to interfere in our  internal affairs. Therefore, we respect those who respect us and  cooperate with them to the end. Iraqi-French relations and the  previous Iraqi-Soviet relations, and Iraqi-Chinese relations,  serve as good examples of this. We established good relations,  even with the United States, but we are very sensitive to any  interference in our internal affairs. I am sure that future is  for Iraq.    [Badawi] Thank you, Mr. Sa'di Mahdi Salih, speaker of the  Iraqi National Assembly.    [Salih] Thank you.</p>

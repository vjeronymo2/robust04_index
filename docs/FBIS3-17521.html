Niyazov pointed out that Turkmenia [Turkmenistan] will  cooperate with Russia on an equal basis whatever the power in  Moscow. In his opinion, Turkmenia should select five or six  states for having close relations with them. According to  Niyazov, all states neighboring Turkmenia can be chosen.    Niyazov expressed surprise that Western countries continue  to  accuse Turkmenia of violating human rights and democracy. He  said that there is not a single political prisoner in the  Republic and anybody can organize a party "with its regulations,  program, supporters and which acts within the framework of the  Constitution and the law."    "We are building an open society in which all human rights  will be respected. Everybody can express his/her opinion, but  when a majority takes a decision, a minority should follow,"  Niyazov said.</p>

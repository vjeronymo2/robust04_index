			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / Australian opposition reshuffle Mr John Hewson, Australia's beleaguered coalition opposition leader, yesterday made space in his shadow cabinet for Ms Bronwyn Bishop, the high-profile New South Wales senator who is widely seen as a potential challenger for Mr Hewson's job, writes Nikki Tait in Sydney. Ms Bishop will become the opposition spokesperson for urban and regional strategy. The move triggered a minor reshuffle of opposition roles. Among the more significant changes, Mr Peter Reith, spokesperson on native title legislation, adds defence to his responsibilities. Opposition senate leader Robert Hill loses defence but becomes head of the opposition's policy review committee. Ms Bishop regularly tops Mr Hewson, and other Liberal party politicians, as the preferred leader of the opposition in public opinion polls.</p>

			<p><P> March 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEWS;  </P> <P> IT'S ALL IN THE TIMING  </P> <P> Another weekend, another set of new series.  </P> <P> The newcomers this time are dramas: ABC's "Men," at 10 tonight on Channels 7,  3, 10 and 42, and NBC's "Quantum Leap," which gets a two-hour introduction at 9  p.m. Sunday on Channels 4, 36 and 39, and then moves into its regular 9 p.m.  slot on Friday.  </P> <P> The premise for "Quantum Leap" is proven and ever appealing. Only the execution  remains a question.  </P> <P> "Quantum Leap" aspires to be "The Time Machine," "Twilight Zone" and "Back to  the Future" rolled into one. A malfunctioning scientific experiment sends Sam  Beckett (Scott Bakula) bounding back in time through his own life span,  intermittently accompanied by an holographic observer named Albert (Dean  Stockwell).  </P> <P> In the two-hour premiere, Beckett awakens in the body of an Air Force test  pilot in 1956 and faces an immediate crisis because he doesn't know how to fly.  He'll make two other time stops before the final commercial, allowing us to use  his experiences to chart our own lives.  </P> <P> As written by executive producer Donald P. Bellisario, "Quantum Leap" for the  most part is so excruciatingly slow and laborious that you wonder if director  David Hemmings was trapped in his own time warp. Yet Bakula does nicely, and  the story ultimately accelerates and even yields some very affecting moments as  Beckett intrudes on his own past.  </P> <P> Freed of the burden of filling two hours, "Quantum Leap" may work better and  surely will move faster as a weekly series. It is amazing that a show about  time, however, would have no concept of it.  </P> <P> "Men," meanwhile, makes a sort of quantum leap from "thirtysomething" to  malesomething -- very promisingly throughout much of tonight's premiere, only  to disintegrate next Saturday. After Episode One, you want to know more about  the mid-to-late 30-ish characters in "Men." After Episode Two, you want to know  less.  </P> <P> Although the filming is in Toronto, the setting is supposedly Baltimore, where  Steven the bachelor surgeon (Ted Wass), Paul the divorced newspaper columnist  (Saul Rubinek), Charlie the married lawyer (Ving Rhames and Danny the single  cop (Tom O'Brien) are old buddies who hang out and have weekly poker games  together.  </P> <P> The death of Danny's older brother, who is also a member of the group, has a  traumatic effect on the men, feeding already existing tensions between Danny  and Charlie and intensifying the relationships among the characters.  </P> <P> Written by co-executive producer Steve Brown and directed by co-executive  producer Peter Werner, this is very compelling work -- stylish, textured and  interesting -- buoyed by nice performances all around. That the story's  tensions are too easily resolved, however, is unfortunately an omen of what  awaits in next Saturday's hour, when "Men" softens its edges in a twist toward  silly farce.  </P> <P> This will be one of those series with no memory, apparently. No longer the  grieving, angry young man of Episode One, Danny next week is a sort of comic  pit stop, exceeded in buffoonery only by the clowning Paul (this character is  really hard to take), who has the hots for the mother of the runaway who has  the hots for Steven. Got it?  </P> <P> The women are all trivial, but so are the men. The result is a clumsy rendition  of the kind of breezy, romping nonsense that "Moonlighting" used to pull off so  deftly. Some of the style is there, but the characters aren't worthy of it.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 5, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> WOO WANTS TO SEE PLANS BEFORE BLOCK IS RAZED  </P> <P> Los Angeles City Councilman Michael Woo has called for an environmental impact  report on a Ventura Boulevard shopping center project that he said could create  an "out-of-scale development" in Sherman Oaks.  </P> <P> In a letter released Friday by homeowner groups, Woo asked Building and Safety  Director Warren O'Brien to order the center's applicant, Jacky Gamiel of Jama  Enterprises, to address the effects of the development being planned for the  13600 block of Ventura Boulevard.  </P> <P> The request came just two weeks after Los Angeles officials denied Gamiel's  application for a permit to tear down stores on the block, including the former  home of Scene of the Crime, a popular mystery bookstore. Woo said the  demolition permit would be withheld indefinitely until the developer revealed  specifics about the project.  </P> <P> Gamiel evicted the Scene of the Crime and other tenants of the 46-year-old row  of one-story storefronts this year. Only one tenant remains -- the restaurant  Mary's Lamb.  </P> <P> Woo told O'Brien in the letter that he understood the project would total up to  100,000 square feet in a "very sensitive area of Sherman Oaks." He said a  project of that size could have a negative effect on traffic, air quality and  the neighboring residential neighborhood.  </P> <P> "The possibility of out-of-scale development which might harm the community is  very real," Woo wrote.  </P> <P> Jama attorney Benjamin M. Reznik criticized Woo's request. "How can he be  demanding an environmental impact report on a project he knows nothing about?"  he said. "The only thing we've asked the city for so far is to demolish the  buildings."  </P> <P> Although he said there were no specific plans, he added that the project under  consideration is about 80,000 square feet.  </P> <P> Reznik said he had written the city Building and Safety Department asking for a  demolition permit or "a written explanation on why it's being denied."  </P> <P> Residents of Sherman Oaks have said they plan to ask Los Angeles officials to  award landmark status to the 1940s-era storefronts. Such a designation would  stall the proposed development.  </P></p>

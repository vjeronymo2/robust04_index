			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Plan for largest union agreed: Nalgo, Nupe and Cohse would create 1.4m-strong body THE FINISHING touches will today be put to a plan which would create Britain's largest, and potentially most influential, trade union. At the end of an election campaign in which the Conservative party has tried to win votes over the issue of trade union power, Nalgo, Nupe and Cohse announced yesterday that their executives had agreed to the proposals for a 1.4m-strong public sector union to be called Unison. The endorsement means members are likely to accept the plans later this year. Employers believe Unison will give workers in sectors including local government and the health service greater power in collective bargaining. In the final two days of the election campaign the Conservatives may seek to make capital by claiming that the new union would exercise a stronger influence on a Labour government than would the three organisations acting independently. Although Unison would not be formed until July next year, it is likely that the three unions will seek to co-ordinate their policies on a range of issues, including public sector pay. The Labour party has said it will seek fairer and more rational ways of determining public sector pay and halt the deterioration of pay and conditions for many public sector workers. However, policies still to be decided include the need, if any, to reform pay determination mechanisms, and whether to proceed with Tory plans to extend performance pay schemes opposed by unions. As Nupe general secretary, Mr Rodney Bickerstaffe was influential in the Labour leadership's adoption of plans for a minimum wage, a controversial issue in the election. Under the merger plans Mr Bickerstaffe, 47, is likely to be sole general secretary from 1995. Initially he will be one of three joint general secretaries, with Mr Hector MacKenzie of Cohse, and Mr Alan Jinkinson, of Nalgo, who will act as a 'first among equals' until he retires in three years time. The unions' three executives have indicated they will support Mr Bickerstaffe in the election to succeed Mr Jinkinson, 57. The merger plans open up the possibility that more members will affiliate to Labour through the union. Although Nupe and Cohse are affiliated to the party, Nalgo is not. The proposals would mean that, after 1995, all members would be able to contribute to a general political fund or a fund used for Labour party affiliations, or neither. Union leaders are confident members will vote for the merger but opposition remains. Some Nalgo members are concerned about a potential clash of cultures between their predominantly white collar union and what they see as the mainly blue collar Nupe and Cohse. However, at Monday's Nalgo executive meeting only a handful of the 75 members voted against the document.</p>

			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Council cleaning overspend revealed More than half the local authorities in Britain are paying a total of Pounds 170m too much each year for their office cleaning, a study published today concludes. About three quarters of the councils have awarded their building cleaning contracts, which are subject to compulsory competitive tendering, to in-house Direct Service Organisations (DSOs). Dr Stefan Szymanski of the Imperial College Management School, who carried out the survey for CDC, the local government research organisation, said the best explanation for the overspending was that in a large number of cases the competitive tendering process for local authorities' building cleaning contracts had not been properly implemented. The findings are in line with an earlier study by Dr Szymanski into local authorities' contracting out of refuse collection. This found that councils which retained the services of DSOs tended to have higher costs. Dr Szymanski said: 'My findings show that competitive tendering, in a significant number of local authorities, is little more than a fiction.' His report says that the annual cost of local authority building cleaning, excluding schools, is Pounds 500m, producing an average annual cost for each council-tax household of Pounds 20. Dr Szymanski compared the cleaning contracts of 232 local authorities with bids by 40 private-sector cleaning companies for a contract to clean 1,000 sq m offices. The bids for this fictitious contract ranged from Pounds 5 to Pounds 11 a sq m annually - the so-called 'competitive benchmark'. The survey estimated that more than half the 232 councils have awarded contracts costing more than Pounds 11 a sq m, and of these 75 per cent are held by DSOs. It also found that fewer than half the contracts awarded within the competitive benchmark had been awarded to DSOs.</p>

			<p><P> May 13, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> DEAL TO SELL PTL NETWORK TO ORAL ROBERTS UNIV. TOLD  </P> <P> A court-appointed trustee says he will sell Jim Bakker's former satellite  network to Oral Roberts University for $6 million at the end of the month  unless he finds a buyer for the entire PTL complex.  </P> <P> "I do have a firm deal with Oral Roberts University.  </P> <P> However, in the contract, I expressly reserved the right to sell all the assets  until the point of approval of the sale of just the network," the trustee,  lawyer Dennis Shedd, said last week.  </P> <P> The 500-acre Heritage USA Christian retreat founded by Bakker and 1,700 acres  of undeveloped PTL land in South Carolina have been for sale along with PTL's  broadcasting holdings since 1988.  </P> <P> The Roberts ministry has been plagued by tight finances in the last few years.  </P> <P> In September, Oral Roberts, a 72-year-old faith healer, closed his City of  Faith hospital and medical school in Tulsa, Okla., and put his home and other  ministry-owned property on the market to repay $25 million in debts.  </P> <P> Roberts' son, Richard, said God told his father, "in what my dad believes is  his last major charge from God, to create a 24-hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week  global Christian, charismatic healing network."  </P> <P> Richard Roberts said the university raised the $1 million down payment from  longtime backers.  </P> <P> Mark Swadener, chief financial officer for the ministries, said he thought the  network could provide a vital source of revenue for the university. He called  the plan to purchase the network "an act of faith."  </P> <P> The ministry also was seeking guaranteed access to the airwaves at a time when  secular networks are displacing evangelists on Sunday mornings in favor of news  shows and cartoons.  </P> <P> Bakker was convicted last fall of fraudulently raising $158 million from PTL  contributors and is serving a 45-year prison sentence in a federal prison in  Minnesota.  </P></p>

			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / Market-Testing in Whitehall: Government seeks to clarify rights of employees in transfers THE government acted yesterday to remove uncertainty about whether regulations concerning the rights of employees when a business is transferred still apply if public services are contracted out. Mr William Waldegrave, the public service minister, used the launch of the Citizen's Charter white paper to dismiss the discussion about the application of the regulations as 'a complete red herring', and argued that savings from contracting out to the private sector would still be achieved. The uncertainty appeared to threaten the programme of market-testing Whitehall services and the contracting out of local-government services. The confusion stemmed from the EC Acquired Rights directive, intended to secure the pay and conditions of workers who change employers in, for example, acquisitions and mergers. Unions and some lawyers argued that the directive applied when work was contracted out. A recent ruling in the European Court of Justice indicated that UK regulations putting the directive into practice were wrong to restrict protection to workers in 'commercial ventures'. The threat of infringement proceedings by the Commission prompted the Employment Department to amend UK legislation to make clear that they applied to non-commercial undertakings. The government's efficiency unit last week wrote to departments and agencies, denying reports that the Foreign Office had suspended its market-testing programme. The letter said the regulations had always covered the public sector and that organisations tendering for public-sector work had to take account of their possible effects. Mr Waldegrave said the regulations applied only when an undertaking was transferred. Whether they applied when delivery of a government service was awarded to a private-sector tender or when a local-authority service was contracted out would depend on the facts of the case.</p>

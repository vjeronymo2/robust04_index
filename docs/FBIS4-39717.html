			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Boris Mainayev] </F>   [Text] Bishkek 9 June TASS -- Indian Minister of State for  External Affairs Salman Khurshid expressed satisfaction with the  results of his working visit to Kirghizia [Kyrgyzstan].    The minister said that all agreements, which are to be  signed  during Indian Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao's forthcoming  official visit to Kirghizia, are almost ready or in the final  stage of completion. The Indian premier is scheduled to visit  the Republic in the first half of July. The agreements will  cover a wide range of bilateral relations between the two  countries, from trade, economic, cultural ties to working out  fast coordinated actions in fight against international  terrorism and drug trafficking.    A group of Indian businessmen, who are accompanying the  minister, finalized their priorities in cooperation with their  Kirghiz counterparts. The Indians are interested in the  possibility of setting up joint enterprises to produce medicine,  process agricultural produce, dress leather, manufacture paper,  extract minerals and create infra-structure and  telecommunications networks.    Salman Khurshid said that the two sides have almost agreed  to  allot a supply quota of mercury, antimony, rare-earth metals and  dressed leather and pelts to India. According to the minister,  India intends to review the agreement's clauses about making  investments in Kirghizia and crediting specific branches of its  economy. This is being done to find a compromise and satisfy  both parties, he said.</p>

"A drafting committee (on military issues) has started to  write down the subjects on which we agree and the security  questions on which differences remain," Israel delegation  spokesman Colonel Ami Gluska told AFP.    "The delegation head to the committee on civilian issues are  doing the same," he added.    The military committee, made up of a jurist and a military  officer from either side, met in a ninth floor suite of the  Hilton hotel at the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Taba where  negotiations resumed on Monday.    Foreign ministry legal adviser Yoel Singer and General David  Agmon, a chief-of-staff adviser on the intifadah, were drafting  a document with Camille Mansur, an international law professor,  and Palestine Liberation Army General 'Abd-al-Raziq al-Yahya.    The four face the main issues which have delayed application  of the September 13 autonomy deal -- the size of the Jericho  enclave and the control of borders and crossings between the  autonomous areas and Jordan and Egypt.    Israeli General Gadi Zohar, head of the military  administration in the West Bank, and Palestinian businessman  Jamil Tarifi, met to draw up a list for the civilian committee  which covers the transfer of powers to the Palestinian authority  for health, education, direct taxation, social welfare and  tourism.    The decision to draft a list of points was taken by Israeli  deputy chief-of-staff General Amnon Shahaq and the PLO's Nabil  Sha'th during a lengthy tete-a-tete in Taba on Tuesday morning.    It followed the suspension of negotiations on December 29  when the PLO denied an Israeli claim that a written  understanding had been reached in Cairo on border crossings and  Jericho.    Menawhile the Palestinians continued to demand an access to  the Dead Sea and several religious sites south of the Jericho  enclave.    "We are no longer talking about square kilometres for  Jericho," Palestinian spokesman Hasan 'Asfur said.    "We are demanding that certain positions in the region be  under Palestinian control, such as religious sites, access to  the Dead Sea, private land and areas inhabited by Palestinians,"  he said.    Iasraeli spokesman Gluska told AFP there was "no agreement  with the Palestinians on the boundaries of the Jericho territory  because there is nothing new in the PLO proposals."

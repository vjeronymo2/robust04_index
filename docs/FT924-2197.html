			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / International Company News: Pacific Telesis to split itself into two PACIFIC Telesis, the California-based local telephone company, is to split itself in two under plans to spin off the company's wireless communications business. The move, a unique departure by a 'Baby Bell' regional telephone company, is aimed at taking advantage of the increasingly competitive US and international telecommunications markets. Mr Sam Ginn, chairman of the group, told the Financial Times that the move signalled the company 'intends to be a world competitor in wireless telecommunications,' taking advantage of global privatisation trends. Pacific Telesis is to spin off its wireless business, which has annual sales of around Dollars 1bn, into a company separate from its local telephone operations, which serve most of California and large parts of neighbouring Nevada and have a turnover around Dollars 9bn. The US local telephone market is slow growing, highly regulated and, while still essentially a monopoly, subject to increasing competition for business customers. The wireless communications market is lightly regulated and growing extremely rapidly, both in the US and other developed countries. Pacific Telesis is one of the largest providers of cellular telephone services in the US and also has a sizeable paging business and a fledgling vehicle tracking operation. It has cellular operations in Germany, Portugal and Japan, and other wireless interests in France, Spain, Thailand and South Korea. The spin-off, expected to take about a year, is the biggest structural change by one of the seven 'Baby Bells' since their creation in 1984, when AT&amp;T was forced to spin off its local operations in a court-ordered anti-trust settlement. Mr Ginn said the creation of two separately traded companies should mean better value for shareholders, since financial markets tended to place a higher value on single focus organisations. The wireless company will be known as Pactel Corp and will raise about Dollars 750m of new equity during the spin off, which will involve a tax-free distribution of the parent company's stake to existing shareholders. Pactel will be headed by 55-year-old Mr Ginn, while the new chairman of Pacific Telesis will be Mr Phil Quigley, 50, president of its Californian phone company, Pacific Bell. Mr Ginn said the split would give Pactel greater ability to raise capital and attract partners in overseas ventures. It may also give it a greater chance to acquire licences in the US for a second generation of mobile telephones, known as personal communications services, which the US government intends to license over the next few year. The Federal Communications Commission has indicated a bias against giving these licences to companies which already hold cellular licences in a particular area. Mr Ginn said Pactel could enter the long-distance market itself or contract for the services of existing suppliers. AT&amp;T, the leading US long-distance carrier, itself underlined the growing links between the two markets last month when it announced plans to take a 33 per cent stake in McCaw Cellular, the largest US cellular carrier. Mr Ginn added that while Pactel had no manufacturing ambitions, it may wish to take an equity stake in an equipment company as part of the development of its services.</p>

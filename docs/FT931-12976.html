			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / The Economy: Builders set to lose 50,000 jobs A FURTHER 50,000 jobs are expected to be shed by the construction industry this year, taking the total to 500,000 since 1989, according to a survey published yesterday. Sir Brian Hill, president of the Building Employers Confederation, said the industry had lost the equivalent of almost 600 jobs every working day since summer 1989. The confederation questioned more than 500 building companies about the outlook for output and employment during the next 12 months. Just under half of those questioned said they expected to announce more job losses by the end of March. Almost a fifth of companies reported that they were working at less than half capacity. Two thirds said they had enough work to last only six months. Sir Brian said the findings of the confederation's latest quarterly workload survey showed that the industry remained in deep recession in spite of a few brighter signs. These included a rise in the number of visitors to houses for sale, and more than a quarter of companies recording an increase in inquiries for work from potential customers against 21 per cent reporting a fall. This is the first positive balance since the second quarter of 1989. The rise in inquiries and visitors still had to be translated into sales, however. As a result the industry was forecasting a further fall in output of 2 per cent this year, following declines of 6 per cent last year and 9 per cent in 1991. 'Whatever is happening in other sectors of industry it is clear from these results that construction remains in serious recession,' Sir Brian said. 'The key indicators of output and employment are still pointing firmly downwards and we have to face the appalling prospect that the construction jobless total will reach the half-a-million mark during 1993.' This would mean a 30 per cent cut in the industry's labour force since summer 1989. More than 20,000 construction companies had failed since then, half of them in the past 12 months. The confederation appealed to the chancellor to help construction by cutting interest rates further, reducing value added tax for house improvements, and abolishing stamp duty in the March Budget. It also wants the government to extend the period for which it will allow 20 per cent capital allowances on industrial and agricultural buildings ordered before October 31 this year. Sir Brian said the industry was enduring the worst recession in living memory: 'Assuming we have confidence returning, then by the end of 1993, and one hopes in 1994, construction will show recovery.'</p>

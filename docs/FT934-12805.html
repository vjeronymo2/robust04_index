			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Reporting reminiscent of an Eisenstein movie Sir, As a new subscriber to the FT in Akashi City, Japan, I was rendered breathless upon receiving my first issues containing the riveting articles by Mr John Lloyd about the clash resulting from the commandeering of the Russian parliament building by foes of President Boris Yeltsin. Mr Lloyd's vivid writing, reminiscent of an Eisenstein movie, conveyed dramatically the exhilaration to pandemonium to terror to despondency which must have been felt by the participants. What also emerged clearly in the articles was the considerable danger to which Mr Lloyd must surely have exposed himself in order to bring us these closely observed stories - passing blood-splattered bodies in smoke-engulfed hallways as people run wildly around, and the like. He deserves a nice tranquil assignment writing about interest rates. Bruce Feldman, Clover House, Apt. 210, 16-5 Higashi Hitomaru-cho, Akashi City, Hyogo-ken 673, Japan</p>

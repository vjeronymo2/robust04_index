			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ergun Aksoy: "Heavy Blow to Hezbollah"] </F>   [Text] Security forces reportedly arrested 22 militants of  the "Menzil" branch of Hezbollah, including its "jihad director"  Emin Teysi, in an operation against the "Menzil" and "Ilim"  branches of Hezbollah. Diyarbakir State Security Court (DGM)  noted that the suspects interrogated were responsible for  carrying out more than 30 perpetrator-unknown killings. The  leader of the Menzil branch, which aims to establish an  independent Kurdish state based on Islamic principles, is wanted  in Istanbul, it was announced.    In the southeast, where approximately 1,600 unresolved  killings have been committed since 1990, the operation is  reportedly continuing against Hezbollah, called "Contra-Hezbol"  by some. The Menzil branch of Hezbollah has reportedly been  largely wiped out as a result of the operations concentrated in  Diyarbakir, Batman, Silvan, and Van. Twenty-two of the  organization's militants were arrested along with the head of  its military wing (jihad director) Emin Teysi. Twelve weapons  used in actions were also seized along with the militants, and  more than 30 unresolved killings were cleared on discovering  that the suspects were responsible for them, it was stated. Emin  Teysi and the 22 militants are now under interrogation at the  Diyarbakir DGM. The investigation will reportedly be completed  this week.  <H5>  Mumcu, Ucok, Aksu </H5>   Speaking to CUMHURIYET, Diyarbakir DGM authorities said that  the militants' activities were concentrated in the southeast.  "They have no connection with the well-known murders of Ugur  Mumcu, Bahriye Ucok, Muammer Aksoy, Mehmet Sincar, and Musa  Anter. The organization has two leaders, but they have not been  apprehended yet. We sent wanted notices for these two persons to  all units. They are most likely in hiding in Istanbul."  Authorities pointed out they were unable to establish any link  between the Menzil members and Iran and said that the  organization's goal is "to establish an independent Kurdish  state based on Islamic principles" in the southeast. Authorities  said:    "We can describe the Menzil branch as a splinter group  broken  off from the Ilim group, but there is not much information about  the reasons for the split. These two groups are still fighting.  Many of the killings committed by the Menzil members are  directed at Ilim members. Actions against the PKK [Workers Party  of Kurdistan] and PKK sympathizers are relatively few. The  Menzil is a new movement. They presented themselves to the  public as an antiviolence movement when they first emerged.  However, they have changed their policies in the past year and  become defenders of violence. They want to get their own forces  accepted instead of the Ilim branch. They want to be sole  leaders of the organization."  <H5>  Ilim Branch </H5>   The Ilim branch of the Hezbollah which has defended armed  struggle since its origin reportedly has its headquarters in  Diyarbakir. Huseyin Velioglu, a native of Batman who is said to  be the leader of the Ilims, who meet near the Ilim Library,  reportedly has connections with Iran. It was noted that security  forces do not have much information about the Ilims, whose  organization resembles Iranian Hezbollah. Diyarbakir DGM  authorities said the following in relation to the Ilim branch of  Hezbollah:    "Ilim is a more dangerous movement than Menzil. Members of  the Ilim group have been arrested, but we cannot get a breakdown  of the organizational structure because they are only from the  ranks. Hezbollah is called the `Party of God,' but we have no  information as to whether Ilim and Menzil are connected with the  true Hezbollah in Iran and Lebanon. However, we have heard that  the Ilim group is close to the Iranian Hezbollah and its  militants are trained in Iran. It is difficult to draw an  organization chart as long as no top level administrators can be  apprehended."</p>

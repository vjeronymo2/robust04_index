Hwang sang chun, chairman of the State Environmental  Commission, and representatives of various strata took the floor.    The speakers branded the South Korean rulers' nuclear waste  dumping in the sea as an anti-national, anti-human crime that  can be committed only by those indifferent to the existence of  the nation and international law and as a never-to-be-condoned  crime in cutting the lifeline of the nation.    The South Korean puppets dumped as much as 11,000 trillion  bequerel of nuclear waste in the sea in the 1986-1992 period.    In South Korea, even the Raktong River has been contaminated  with radioactive material, causing a big public stir.    The speakers said due to the South Korean puppets' nuclear  waste dumping, fishes in South Korean waters have disappeared,  the haul of myongthae has diminished to ten percent, undaria  pinnatifida and other sea resources have been exterminated and  women often give birth to deformed babies.    They pointed out that the nuclear waste dumping is getting  more grave and dangerous with the nuclear arms development  promoted in secrecy in South Korea.    The South Korean puppets started to develop nuclear weapons  under the "nuclear umbrella" of U.S. imperialism long ago and  now they are promoting nuclear arms development, possessed of  reprocessing facilities.    The traitor Kim Yong-sam unilaterally scrapped the joint  declaration on the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.    The speakers denounced the Kim Yong-sam group for massively  shipping Patriot and other means of nuclear war to South Korea  and desperately working to unleash a war while crying for an  "international cooperation system" and "military countermove"  over the faked-up "nuclear issue" of the North.    They demanded that the South Korean puppet clique  unconditionally stop the nuclear arms development, discard the  intention of igniting a new war in collusion with outside forces  and step down without delay.</p>

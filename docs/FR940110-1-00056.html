			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition, as set forth in the Board's proposed amendment,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;960.1 of this proposed rule defines ``very low-income household''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as a household which has an income of 50 percent or less of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> median income for the area, as adjusted and published by HUD,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> except in areas where the Secretary adjusts this figure downward  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because of prevailing construction costs, low housing costs, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unusually high household incomes. For areas where the Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> makes this downward adjustment, ``very low-income household'' would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be defined to mean a household which has an income of 50 percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or less of the median income for the area, as published by HUD,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with adjustment for household size, but without the adjustments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> made by the Secretary for prevailing construction costs, low  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> housing costs, or unusually high household incomes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While HUD publishes tables with adjusted income information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that incorporates the adjustments for family size, prevailing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> construction costs, low housing costs, and unusually high family  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incomes, it does not publish tables with income information that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjusts only for family size and not these other factors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, as set forth in the Board's proposed amendment, &sect;960.1  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of this proposed rule adds a definition of ``adjustment for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> household size'' in order to provide additional guidance in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calculating this adjustment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An adjustment for household size is made by taking a specified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percentage of the income limit of a four-person household for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particular area, according to the following scale:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 2,L2,tp0,i1,s50,r50 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> &blank; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1No. persons <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Percent adjustment <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 70. 2 <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 80. 3 <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 90. 4 <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> Base. 5 <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 108. 6 <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 116. 7 <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 124. 8 <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 132. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </TABLE>  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For each person in excess of eight, eight percent of the four-person household base income limit should be added to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> income limit for an eight-person household for the area. These  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjustment factors are the same as those used by HUD in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administering its housing programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 960.1 of the proposed rule retains the definition of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``area'' from the Board's existing AHP regulation. See 12 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 960.1(c). ``Area'' means, for purposes of defining ``median income  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the area,'' a metropolitan statistical area, a county, or a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonmetropolitan area, as established by the U.S. Office of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Management and Budget. Consistent with the proposed amendment,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;960.1 of this proposed rule does not include a definition of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``median income'' because it is included in the proposed definitions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of ``very low-income household'' and ``low- or moderate-income  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> household.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Definition of ``income''. The Act is silent on how to define the term ``income,''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> what are eligible sources of household income that should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered in determining whether the household satisfies the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definition of ``low- or moderate-income household'' or ``very  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> low-income household.'' The Board has determined not to define the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> term ``income'' in the proposed rule. Homeownership projects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> typically involve the participation of a lender which provides  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permanent financing for the homeowner over an extended period of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time. The lender generally verifies a household's income prior to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issuing a financing commitment during the underwriting of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> loan. Eligible sources of income are identified by the lender  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during the mortgage underwriting process. Identifying eligible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sources of income in the rule could cause inconsistency with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lenders' customary and usual underwriting practices, or with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards applied by the entity providing the major source of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financing for the project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Rental housing units.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 960.5(a)(1) of the proposed rule provides generally that at least 20 percent of the rental housing units in a project financed under the AHP with subsidized advances or direct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subsidies shall remain affordable for and occupied by very  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> low-income households for a minimum period of 30 years or, at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> election of the sponsor, the remaining useful life of such units.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

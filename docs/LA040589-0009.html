			<p><P> April 5, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MISSILE TEST  </P> <P> I sure hope that all the reader's of the Los Angeles Times enjoyed that  spectacular front-page photo (March 22) of the fizzled Trident 2 missile doing  cartwheels off the coast of Cape Canaveral.  </P> <P> A magnificent sight to behold as our taxes to the tune of $23.7 million went up  in smoke. It's no wonder the folks at the IRS find it hard to deal with the  natives in this country on April 15th!  </P> <P> ARTHUR J. BREZAE  </P> <P> Chatsworth  </P></p>

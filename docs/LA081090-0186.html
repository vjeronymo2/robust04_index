			<p><P> August 10, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MIAMI'S HOLT OUT FOR YEAR BUT HAPPY HE'LL PLAY AGAIN  </P> <P> Miami Dolphins rookie fullback Leroy Holt will miss the 1990 season with a  fractured vertebra at the base of his neck, but he says the injury could have  been worse.  </P> <P> "I feel like a blessed man," said the 5-10, 224-pounder from USC.  </P> <P> "Doctors told me I would have been paralyzed if I was a little scrawny guy. I  had a big (spinal-cord) canal. Thank God."  </P> <P> The hairline fracture, between Holt's fourth and fifth vertebra, is such that  doctors Thursday assured him his career has not ended.  </P> <P> "I can play again," he said. "I had prepared for the worst."  </P> <P> Holt was injured July 31 when he clashed head-on with linebacker John Offerdahl  during a drill.  </P> <P> For the next three months, Holt will wear a bulky collar-brace that extends up  the back of his head.  </P> <P> The Dolphins' fifth-round draft pick had earned praise from Coach Don Shula  during training camp and appeared likely to make the final roster.  </P></p>

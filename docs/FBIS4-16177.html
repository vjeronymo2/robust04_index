			<p>BFN     [Text] In an interview with Interfax and RIA news agencies  on Wednesday evening President Boris Yeltsin summed up the main  results of his first official visit to Spain.    "The main thing is that the visit was fruitful. The  foundation for active cooperation between Russia and Spain was  laid", the president said. He pointed to the significance of  the friendship and cooperation treaty as well as several other  key agreements signed in Madrid.    He also attached great importance to personal relations with  the Spanish leaders and politicians, which he described as very  good.    "I felt that Spaniards were as attracted to Russia as  Russians to Spain. Nothing separates us, while Europe, European  affairs, common security and concerns about economic stability  in both Russia and Spain unite use", Yeltsin said.    The president spoke of the importance of the Spanish  experience of the transition from dictatorship to democracy. He  said Russians should draw useful conclusions from this  experience.    Yeltsin again spoke for signing a cooperation agreement  between Russia and the European Union in the nearest future.    On Russia's membership in the NATO Partnership for Peace  program Yeltsin said the country will gradually prepare for  signing such an agreement, but will not hurry.</p>

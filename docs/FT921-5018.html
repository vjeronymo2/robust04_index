			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / Arts: Cruel master of martyrdoms / Review of the pitch dark world of Jusepe de Ribera In Poussin's 'St Erasmus' the saint's entrails are slowly being winched out of his stomach, but the sky is still blue and martyrdom seems no more troublesome than a visit to the dentist. In Jusepe de Ribera the prospect of death is not so agreeable. His saints inhabit an urgent, brutal and pitch-dark world in which raking light is the only sign of salvation, and colour is courtesy of burning coals and flayed flesh. Counter Reformation art was fond of celebrating the sacrifices of the saints, and gory mythologies were common in Renaissance art. In Ribera, as in Titian and Rembrandt, what disturbs is that the protagonists are real people. Ribera's executioners particularly relish their tasks. In his 'Martyrdom of St Bartholomew' the colluding grins of the executioners draw one into the mob, which is stringing up the wasted body of the aged Bartholomew, and into the terrifying confusion and crush where snatches of action and disembodied faces loom out of the night. The painting is a tour de force of unsettling diagonal rhythms and of sagging, dry and wrinkled flesh produced by dragging a bristly brush through richly impasted pigment. It is also informed by an unusual intelligence. Ribera has selected the essential moment of bloodlust. Bartholomew has refused to worship the pagan idol; as it falls to the floor the order is out for him to be flayed alive and the henchmen are busy tying his legs with rope. As all torturers know, the anticipation of what is to come is their most effective implement. Caravaggio offers blood-and-guts violence; Ribera, his closest follower in Naples, has an unmistakable strain of cruelty. Was the savagery of his martyrdoms simply a relection of the violence of life in 17th-century Naples, or an indication of a darker, essentially Spanish psychology? Jusepe de Ribera, known as 'lo Spagnoletto' - the little Spaniard - is a problematic artist in many ways. Born in Valencia, he lived most of his adult life in Naples, then under the dominion of the Spanish viceroys. His painting, however, is very much part of the Italian tradition. Precious little is known of his early life or oeuvre, and the range and virtuosity of his mature work is surprisingly unfamiliar to a general public. His relative neglect stems from the fact that he is either renegade or foreigner to these national schools of painting. His reputation has suffered too from the numerous copies and imitations of his work made during his lifetime, and by the capacity of his vast, tenebrous narratives to defy reproduction. An opportunity for reappraisal comes at last in the form of an ambitious all-embracing loan exhibition of paintings, drawings and etchings, conceived to mark the 400th anniversary of his birth in 1591. Planned to open in Madrid last October, it instead takes its first bow in the massive 16th-century Castel Sant'Elmo in Naples. The Prado show, which opens in May, is designed to present the 'pure' Ribera to the Spaniards, drawing together work primarily from Spanish religious foundations and collections. In contrast, the Naples show includes school and attributed works which makes it more experimental, contentious and, above all, thrilling. Ribera unfolds along a sequence of the fortress's imposing stone vaulted spaces, the pictures theatrically set against brilliant scarlet cloth. There are peculiarities in chronology perhaps, and some unlikely candidates for the hand of Ribera. Unevenness is also due to the spotlighting and to the dramatically varying states of preservation (or lack of) and restoration of the canvases. Nonetheless, the impact of the scale and conception of Ribera at his best is astounding. There is the compellingly grotesque 2.29m wide 'Drunken Silenus' where the gross Silenus is lying surrounded by a motley band of horribly naturalistic satyrs and the goat-horned Pan, and the blood-curdling Apollo flaying Marsyas. Tityus and Prometheus, both in monstrous scale (their poses, like that of St Bartholomew, derive from the Antique statue known as the Dying Gaul) suffer agonies as their innards are torn out by an eagle and a vulture. From the Prado comes a great Trinity, a Martyrdom of St Philip and The Dream of Jacob. Ribera has a startling gift of characterisation whether painting saints or villains. Humanity is well observed and detail is ever convincing (another St Bartholomew's assassin holds his knife between his teeth as he uses both hands to tear flesh). The show reveals that there is far more to Ribera than martyrdoms and mythologies. It presents series of half-length Apostles and Philosophers, and genres illustrating the five senses. There are a few splendid formal portraits, such as the proudly bespectacled Knight of the Order of Santiago. Perhaps more unexpected is the tenderness, pure colour and classical repose of the majestic late 'Mystic Marriage of St Catherine'. Ribera's elaborate signatures sought to make it clear that he was a Spaniard rather than a native Neapolitan, his nationality encouraging lucrative commissions from the ruling elite. By the 1620s he was in effect the arbiter of taste in Naples. He worked for a succession of viceroys and for the increasingly wealthy church. It was a position he had worked for and aimed to maintain. Along with his friends he operated a sort of artistic Camorra whereby no painter could work in Naples without their consent, and anyone who proved too proficient was hounded from the city. Guido Reni fled after his assistant was wounded in 1621, Domenichino was tormented and finally died, his wife convinced that he had been poisoned. Annibale Carracci was also reputed to have died as an indirect result of the harassment of this cabal. When Stanzione painted a much admired Dead Christ for the Certosa di San Martino, Ribera persuaded the monks to let him lighten it and in so doing ruined it with corrosive liquid. The clergy had no qualms about employing Caravaggio, a murderer, and any number of artists who were known criminals or of ill-repute. There was no correlation between sacred art and the piety of the patrons or painters. It is tempting to see in Ribera's essentially Italian art a Spanish predilection for horrific martyrdoms, oddities, and for a certain religious sentiment. On the instruction of one of the viceroys, the Duca di Alcala, Ribera painted his most extraordinary picture, a portrait of Magdalena Ventura with her bemused husband and son. Nothing strange about that one might say until one notices the Signora's long black beard. Ribera's inscription tells us that she is 52, and was 37 when she 'began to become hairy', and had borne three sons. The artist has made the image as sensational as possible, depicting Magdalena nursing her child and exposing a floppy brown breast of a kind never found in any Madonna. The Naples venue has an additional advantage of the neighbouring Certosa di San Martino, with its great Pieta by Ribera and series of newly restored frescoes. There is also access to the Chapel of St Januarius in the Cathedral. The show continues in Naples until March 12, the Spanish version is at the Prado Museum in Madrid, May 30-August 25. A much reduced version of that show goes to the Metropolitan Museum in New York, Septembre 16-November 22.</p>

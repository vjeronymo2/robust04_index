			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Lima, 25 Feb (DPA) -- A massive gathering in Lima  this evening repudiated the "impunity" which prevailed  concerning the assassination of 10 persons, given a military  court's decision not to punish the people who reportedly planned  the massacre.    The gathering occurred on the same day the European Union  stated in a letter to the Peruvian Government its concern about  the way in which the case had been handled -- a concern that has  already been stated by the United States.    Today's event, held at San Martin Square in downtown Lima,  was convoked by relatives of the 10 victims in the so-called "La  Cantuta Case," and it received the support of human rights  groups, student associations, professional colleges, and popular  organizations. Gisela Ortiz, spokesperson of the victims'  relatives, said the event was a protest against the "complicity"  of the government, which created the conditions so the case  could be handled by a military court rather than a civilian  court, as hoped by relatives, the opposition, and independent  observers.    The different speakers who addressed hundreds of  demonstrators agreed in demanding the annulment of the  controversial law which allowed a military court to handle the  case and the subsequent annulment of the military trial which  ended this week with sentences for nine of the people involved  in the case.    Ortiz also said the relatives will continue to "stand  around"  indefinitely in front of the Justice Palace one and a half hours  every Wednesday to protest against what has happened.    Today's event, which was carried out peacefully, was limited  to a gathering at San Martin Square because the organizers could  not get a permit to march from the 2 May Square to the Justice  Palace, which was their goal.    Following a verbal trial which barely lasted four days, on  Monday a military court passed sentences ranging between 15 and  20 years for two Army majors and four NCO's, who, according to  the evidence, actively participated in the event. It handed down  sentences ranging between one and five years for three officers  who were charged with negligence. The ruling, currently being  reviewed by the Supreme Military Justice Court's examiner board  because all the defendants appealed the sentence, was rejected  by the victims' relatives and various groups because it fails to  punish the people who planned the massacre and it states that  the assassins acted on their own.    The massacre was perpetrated on 18 July 1992 by military  personnel who seized the student residences at the state-owned  La Cantuta University and kidnapped a professor and nine  students. They were later assassinated and buried on the city's  outskirts.    Prosecutor Victor Cubas, who was in charge of the case until  the controversial law turned the case over to a military court,  confirmed today that the operation had included the  participation of at least 45 military personnel. Therefore, he  cannot understand why sentences were only given to six persons.</p>

			<p><P> November 21, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WATER DISTRICT UNVEILS PLAN TO FIGHT  DROUGHT  </P> <P> The Metropolitan Water District, which serves about 15 million people in  Southern California, unveiled a plan Tuesday to deal with the on-going drought.  </P> <P> The first phase of the plan will go into effect Dec. 1 and involves cash  incentives and disincentives and improvements in storage and management, said  Carl Boronkay, general manager of the Los Angeles based utility.  </P> <P> The 27 public agencies making up the district's membership will be asked to  voluntarily reduce their monthly usage. Subsequent phases will involve planned  use of regional reservoir and ground water reserves and surcharges to agencies  that exceed assigned monthly quotas.  </P> <P> "Four consecutive dry years have created a threat to our water supplies never  before experienced by Southern California," Boronkay said. "In light of  precariously low water levels in State Water Project storage reservoirs and the  potential for reduced diversions from the Colorado River, this plan is  necessary if we are to minimize hardships in our homes and businesses."  </P></p>

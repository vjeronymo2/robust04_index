			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Sanaa--Some of the principal political powers in  Yemen are in the midst of a fierce and foreboding debate  concerning the significance of the awakening of the Bakil tribe  and the extent of the connection of this rising to any of the  governing political parties. The United Bakil Council concluded  the business of its first general conference, which was held in  the region of the Anisi tribes, the day before yesterday, amidst  opposition to it and its rejection by some of the political and  tribal symbols of Anisi, and especially those belonging to the  Popular General People's Congress, the leader of which is the  Yemeni president 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih.    While these same mentioned that the conference was plagued  with failure because of their refusal to receive it in their  regions, Shaykh Muhammad 'Ali Abu Luhum confirmed in a telephone  call to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the conference was crowned by  success and was attended by about 40,000 people from among the  men of the Bakil tribes and various governorates.    He confirmed the error of those who portrayed the Bakil  conference as putting forth a call for disunion, when it is  exactly the opposite. Likewise, he rejects any process of  political or partisan polarization.    He referred to the decisions and recommendations that the  conference issued at the end of its business and which the  closing statement contained. They concentrated on the handling  of the internal issues of the Bakil tribes first, and on the  presentation of a group of special and general issues in various  spheres, the most important of which is working to display the  civilized side of the Bakil tribes, the effective participation  in building the Yemeni state, the preservation of unity and  democracy, the accomplishments of the revolution, the doing away  with any differences in the Bakil framework, and the striving to  end all differences between it and the other tribes.    The Bakil conference confirmed its devotion to unity and  democracy as an irrevocable choice, and the working towards  sovereignty of the law and the system. It demanded the "sound  rebuilding of the security organizations nationally, and the  reformation of the armed forces so that they protect the country  and its sovereignty and are not a heavy weight on the nation or  a protector or friend of the people in power or in the parties."    The Bakil tribes demanded to be made a participant, through  their United Council, in any arrangements relating to  state-building issues. [They also demanded] the acceptance of  the Bakil Council's opinion, the necessity of giving the Bakil  people and all the ordinary people an equal opportunity in  public service, including the armed forces and security forces,  without reservation, in the same manner as others from among the  tribes, and the taking of an interest in the rights of all the  families of the martyrs.    Likewise, the Bakil Council demanded the necessity of  completing the centralization and the granting of full powers to  the people of the governorates and districts, which enables them  to serve their regions according to the system of local  governing. [They also demanded] the rebuilding of the state  organizations, and for the end of the double standard, and  giving the qualified individuals and cadres the positions that  they deserve. They demanded the hastening of the end of the  present crisis, which is on the verge of threatening the unity  of the country, and the necessity of requiring all the political  powers, and especially those within the framework of the  governing coalition, to refrain from all the practices that tend  to cause disunion inside society.    The statement also demanded that all the parties refrain  from  political provocation that leads to breach of security and  violation of the national constants and hinders the movement of  life. Regarding the army and security, it demanded purging both  of them of the elements whose failure has been proved and which  had a role in frustrating the responsibilities of this  institution, and then replacing them with new elements that are  capable of undertaking their role free and clear of  subordination to people or parties or to the influential people  in power.    It demanded working to withdraw the armed forces from inside  the cities, doing away with the subordination of the armed  forces to the sections of power, and opening the door of service  to all ordinary people. Likewise, it demanded the changing of  the heads of the armed forces in the various military units who  belong to any one of the sections of power, or those who belong  to one region, and taking another look at the appointment of  these leaders, on the condition that the retirement law be  applied, and the process of blind conscription be stopped.    In the economic sphere, the statement pointed to the need to  require the government to maintain public funds and to paralyze  the hands tinkering with them, to observe the activity of the  revenue-related institutions and the central bank, to not  monopolize the public funds in the hands of an individual or  party who uses them to buy protections and party and political  loyalties, and [the need] to prevent the administering of the  public funds for anything except what is in agreement with the  regulations and laws, in the framework of what the public budget  of the state establishes.    It demanded the hastening of putting plans and reform and  growth programs into place, the limiting of luxury government  spending, the checking of the process of issuing money, the  abolishing of what is called invisible clauses and the  application of the principle of financial protection, and the  putting into operation of the principle of "Where did you get  this?"    Likewise, it demanded the limitation of the number of  workers  in the state institutions, including the army and the security  forces, the opening of the door of compulsory retirement for the  people in high positions of responsibility, the hastening to  finish the establishment of the free economic and trade zone in  the capital, Aden, and the directing of oil revenues towards  what produces a push to the production process and the building  of an agricultural renaissance. The statement touched on the  demand for various services and the treatment of problems of  revenge, and the new manifestations of crime and drugs and the  like.    The statement concluded with the Bakil Council's assurance  that these demands express the concerns and aspirations of all  the ordinary people, and not just the Bakil people. However, the  Council takes the presentation of these demands upon itself  within the scope of its comprehensive national directives.</p>

In this way, Tietmeyer alluded  to the Bundesbank's opportunities within the framework of its  open-market policy.    "We have been using all our room for maneuver on stability  policies and we will continue to do so," the Bundesbank  president said. However, the Bundesbank also must not fail to  see the risks that still threaten stability. In this respect,  the Association for the Protection of Savers is right with its  statement that the war against inflationary forces has not yet  been won. However, progress has been made on the road to  greater stability. February inflation is still clearly above 3  percent, but without the gasoline-tax increase there would  already be a 2 before the decimal point, Tietmeyer said.  However, a considerable part of this improvement is due to  lower import prices and thus not earned in Germany.    The Bundesbank president also assessed the latest collective  agreements as a positive signal for future monetary stability.  After some wrong tracks in the past, the parties to collective  agreements have now turned into the road of reason, he said.  However, the Bundesbank is concerned about the strong expansion  of the money supply. The M3 value, which increased by more than  20 percent in January, is the value for one month calculated on  a yearly basis, and it is distorted by special factors.  However, the liquidation effect resulting from the new tax  regulation may not disappear in the short term, all the more so  since the latest wait-and-see attitude on the capital markets  has not yet been overcome. The money supply continues to be an  important indicator for the bank, he said.    However, the money supply is a yearly and not a monthly  target, Tietmeyer stressed. Moreover, it is only an  intermediate target on the road to the actual objective of price  stability. At any rate, the latest development on the  international capital markets has little to do with the  development of the money supply in Germany and even less with  the Bundesbank's policy. This is shown not least by  developments on the foreign exchange market.    Referring to the criticism of the trend of earnings of  German  banks, Tietmeyer said that it is precisely in periods of  economic weakness that well-founded and highly profitable banks  are important for the economy as a whole. They are a  stabilizing factor in an altogether difficult and insecure  environment. However, the Bundesbank president also added: "Of  course, this does not mean that the ability to pass on relief  from the Bundesbank is already being fully utilized by all  banks."    In the efforts to improve the efficiency of Germany as a  financial location, the introduced reorganization and reduction  of minimum reserves by the Bundesbank fits the new scene very  well. "However, the reduction of minimum reserves is not the  first step toward their abolition," the Bundesbank president  stressed. The Bundesbank thinks that the instrument of minimum  reserves continues to be indispensable, and it will advocate  that minimum reserves will also become one of the monetary  policy instruments of the future European Central Bank.    In his speech, FRG Finance Minister Theo Waigel made it  clear  that the FRG Government wants to continue to support the  development of Germany as a financial location. However, when  Waigel said that the tax on interest income is the best  decision, he met with a clear response in the hall. Waigel  countered by saying that the tax on interest income was  developed with the participation of a representative of the  association and he told the bankers present: "I will gladly pass  on your annoyance to Karlsruhe, but you cannot vent it on the  finance minister here in Bonn."</p>

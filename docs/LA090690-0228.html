			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW WAVES, NEW TACK FOR BEACH BOYS;  </P> <P> SAILING: POP GROUP WILL RAISE MONEY FOR AN AMERICA'S CUP SYNDICATE. THEY AIM AT  '92 CHALLENGE.  </P> <P> Let's go sailin' now, everybody's learnin' how . . .  </P> <P> Those natty cats in blue blazers who run the America's Cup nearly fell off  their deck chairs a couple of months ago, when a 1939 Ford Woody with  surfboards on top pulled up in front of the yacht club. Five men jumped out,  kicked the sand off their feet and asked where they could go to enter the race.  </P> <P> Well, it wasn't quite like that, but the imagery plays well.  </P> <P> We're talking fantasy here, and after all, much of what the rest of the world  knows about California was influenced from the early 1960s, when the Beach  Boys' recorded musical hits started rolling in like the waves at Huntington  Beach.  </P> <P> Surfing was the craze, now the Boys can slide gracefully into middle age and  their natural transition: sailing. Change a word here, a beat there and it's  all the same warm sun and salty air:  </P> <P> Everybody's gone sailin', Sailin' USA . . .  </P> <P> The Beach Boys' USA syndicate is one of three groups hoping to win the right to  defend the Cup for the San Diego Yacht Club in trials scheduled to start in  January 1992. There were four until Peter Isler's team dropped out Aug. 29, and  the remainder -- Dennis Conner, Larry Klein and the Beach Boys -- each must  show a $6-million stack of chips by Oct. 1 to stay in the game. Eventually,  each will need about $15 million to play in this terribly expensive game.  </P> <P> Conner already has his $6 million, and it wouldn't seem to be a serious order  for one of the most successful musical groups ever, except that the Boys don't  have a royalty of their own invested in the project. They won't even help sail  the boat -- that's John Bertrand's job -- let alone clean the bottom.  </P> <P> What they Beach Boys are contributing is their good name and space for sponsors  on a concert tour, most of it scheduled for next year. The campaign will get a  boost from a sold-out concert Sunday at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium.  </P> <P> Syndicate Chairman David Lowry said the 1991 tour will do a minimum of 125  dates in 75 cities, including 50 "major markets."  </P> <P> "It's not Abilene, Kan.," Lowry said. "When you see what the Beach Boys are  throwing in, it's staggering."  </P> <P> For sponsorship packages of $1 1/2 million, $3 million or $5 million, Lowry  said, "A corporate sponsor, in addition to everything they get on the boats,  gets signing on all handouts of the concerts, signing above the stage,  corporate display booths at the concerts, large amounts of tickets to the  concerts, backstage passes for the VIPs, photo sessions with the band, hats . .  .  </P> <P> "A year before the America's Cup even takes place, our corporate sponsors are  being blasted all over America. The bang you get for a buck with us doesn't  compare to any other syndicate worldwide . . . actually for less money than  what Dennis is offering."  </P> <P> The idea was born on all the impulse of a horn honking at the curb and a shout,  "Surf's up!"  </P> <P> Bertrand and boat designers Doug Peterson, John Reichel and Jim Pugh were  sitting around itching to jump into the America's Cup game. They had the  credentials. All they needed was the $15 million.  </P> <P> Peterson knew Lowry, who is a member of the San Diego Yacht Club and a neighbor  of Elliott Lott, who is the president of the Beach Boys.  </P> <P> "I've known him many years," Lowry said. "Doug Peterson called me and was  frustrated that he and Jim Pugh and John Reichel and John Bertrand had all this  talent and weren't tied into any syndicate, and said: 'Why don't you put a  syndicate together?'  </P> <P> "I laughed at him. I said, 'I'm not that foolish' -- plus you need a special  hook. With the money that's necessary, trying to do a Dennis Conner-lookalike  campaign isn't going to work.  </P> <P> That was early June.  </P> <P> "I was lying in bed that night and I saw on the side of the boat the Beach Boys  with palm trees," Lowry said. "I called Elliott about 11 at night and said,  'I've got this crazy idea.' He called me back the next day and said, 'I like  it, let's talk about it.'  </P> <P> "Within a week, we put the concept together, and the next day we went to meet  with the (America's Cup) Organizing Committee. They looked at us and thought we  were crazy, but the more they thought about it, the more they liked it.  </P> <P> "We said, 'We'll come back in 30 days and tell you if we're a go or not.' We  came back in 30 days. That was the day we announced, and the next day they  accepted us as a (potential) defender."  </P> <P> Bertrand said: "We really didn't want to announce at that time and be lumped in  with those groups that weren't that serious. But we were forced to show our  hand, and that was probably good. What we've accomplished in three months is  quite amazing."  </P> <P>  Catch a wave and you're sittin' on top of the world . . .  </P> <P> Bertrand has been there. In 1984, the Newport Beach resident earned an Olympic  silver medal in the Finn class, and last year, he sailed Longobarda to the  world maxi championship. He also was tactician aboard Courageous in the 1983  America's Cup campaign and on America II off Fremantle, Australia, in 1986-87.  </P> <P> He learned two lessons from working with skipper John Kolius in the latter  campaign -- pace and dealing with pressure.  </P> <P> America II, which represented the New York Yacht Club, was the best funded of  six American challengers; it pursued an energetic, three-boat development  program, and it enjoyed early apparent success, but ran out of steam and failed  to qualify for the challenger semifinals. While Conner's Sail America team  continued to refine its boat, America II went, almost literally, dead in the  water.  </P> <P> The Beach Boys' team doesn't even plan to compete in next May's world  championship for the new America's Cup class boats, but will build up slowly to  a big finish.  </P> <P> "I don't want to be in the worlds," Lowry said. "I want to be watching other  people's (boats). I don't want them looking at mine. We don't have any  intention of having a boat in the water until the end of July next year. We do  not need to build a boat for marketing purposes. Dennis (Conner) felt that he  needed to build a boat. It was important for fund-raising."  </P> <P> Bertrand said: "The America's Cup is a race of technology, and toward the end  of the trials, the development accelerates."  </P> <P> Even before going to Australia, Kolius, given too heavy a load, all but  collapsed under the pressures.  </P> <P> "What I learned from that campaign was there are going to be pressures you have  to deal with," Bertrand said. "By surrounding yourself with the right  individuals and giving them a lot of responsibility, you don't have the risk of  one individual falling apart. Then the whole program is weakened.  </P> <P> "With John, there is no better teacher out there. I had the opportunity to  learn from the best. He may ask Kolius to join him on the Beach Boys' boat.  </P> <P> Reichel and Pugh also designed Abracadabra, which leads the International  50-foot circuit, and Mitch Rouse's Taxi Dancer, perhaps the best all-round boat  among the West Coast ultralight 70s. Nobody knows what they'll come up with for  '92.  </P> <P> We'll have fun, fun, fun till our daddy takes the T-bill away . . .  </P> <P> Times researcher Lauri Ferguson contributed to this story.  </P></p>

			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Finance and the Family: The Week Ahead ON TUESDAY, Sears, the retail group, is expected to announce to interim profits of about Pounds 30m, after exceptional costs relating to the closure of ter Meulen Post, the Dutch mail order business. That compares with losses of Pounds 8.8m, though that included an exceptional charge of Pounds 32.5m. Analysts are looking for a strong recovery from British Shoe, but the performance of the rest of the group is expected to be patchy. Dorling Kindersley, the publisher of reference books floated last October, is expected to report annual profits of about Pounds 9.5m on Tuesday. Analysts downgraded to that level in March, when the group warned of tougher competition for children's books in the US. Redland, the construction materials group, reports its interim results on Thursday and is expected to lift pre-tax profits to about the Pounds 100m mark, against Pounds 88.5m last time. Forte, the hotels and restaurants group, also reports interim profits on Thursday, with expectations of pre-tax profits of between Pounds 42m and Pounds 45m. News of the progress of the London hotels will be closely noted.</p>

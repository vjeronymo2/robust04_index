			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / People: Bodies politic Laurie Slade has been promoted to become insurance ombudsman after the controversial resignation of Julian Farrand earlier this month. Farrand, who is to become pensions ombudsman later this year, said he was disillusioned over the future of the office. The establishment of the Personal Investment Authority, the new watchdog set up to protect the private investor, was undermining the ombudsman's position, he said. Slade, 50, who has been Farrand's deputy for the past six years, is a barrister and a Fellow of the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators. Yesterday he appeared to have accepted the diminishing role of the Insurance Ombudsman's office: 'We have to effect an orderly transition to the PIA ombudsman of investment complaints against insurers and fulfil whatever residual role remains for us in this field.' Bryan Austin, 59, who retired last year from WH Smith, has been appointed a member of the Gaming Board. Austin, whose term runs for two years from September 1994, takes over from Michael Hogan, a former secretary of the Gaming Board who joined the five-strong board in March 1986. Austin was employed by WH Smith from 1971 until his retirement in 1993 and held the post of group director, business planning and development from 1988 to 1993. He was previously employed by United Biscuits, Dorland Advertising and Atwood Statistics. The Home Secretary makes all appointments to the Gaming Board, which was established by the Gaming Act 1968 with two functions, namely to keep under review the extent, character and location of gaming facilities in Great Britain and to regulate the conduct of casinos and other establishments where gaming takes place. It is chaired by Lady Littler.</p>

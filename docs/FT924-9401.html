			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Molybdenum mine to close temporarily CYPRUS MINERALS Company will temporarily shut its Thompson Creek primary molybdenum mine in Idaho because of weak demand for steel, reports Reuter from Denver. The company said the mine's sales had fallen in 1992. It will reopen the mine when it sees improvement in molybdenum prices, which have remained at a 20-year low. Cyprus said during the shutdown it would meet molybdenum demand from by-product output at its Sierrita and Bagdad copper mines in Arizona.</p>

			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / International Company News: Banco de Colombia sold for Dollars 500m Colombia's biggest privatisation was completed this week with the sale of 75 per cent of the Banco de Colombia to Bancol, the Cali-based business group. Including smaller packages of shares bought by employees and other investors, the bank was sold for around Dollars 500m. Banco de Colombia, originally part of the Grupo Grancolombiano which collapsed in the mid-1980s, was nationalised and rehabilitated by the government. It is one of the biggest banks in Colombia, with about 12 per cent of the total assets of the country's financial system, 11 per cent of local branches and majority holdings in several subsidiaries. Bancol, owned by the Gilinski family, offered about Dollars 360m for 75 per cent of the shares. The government has been trying to prevent drug money from filtering into the financial system through privatisation deals. The Gilinski family owns several small industries as well as the Banco Andino, which has about 1.5 per cent of the local market. Banco de Colombia has a subsidiary in Panama and owns the Eagle National Bank of Miami. An offering of Dollars 220m notes exchangeable into shares is also being made internationally through Deutsche Bank and its Morgan Grenfell subsidiary in London. Renault, the French state-owned vehicle company, is selling control of its Colombian subsidiary to the Santo Domingo Group, one of the country's largest business concerns, John Ridding adds from Paris. The move is the final step in Renault's policy of reducing its exposure to financial and political risks in Latin America, while maintaining its commercial presence.</p>

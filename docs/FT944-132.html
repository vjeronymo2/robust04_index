			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Mattress the safest option? Sir, If 'Private pensions are no better safeguard' (Letters, December 21), can Professor Buiter please suggest a viable alternative. Having just bailed out of a disastrous personal equity plan with a view to topping up my pension, I am beginning to wonder whether the proceeds might not be safer under the mattress.

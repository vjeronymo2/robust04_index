			<p><P> June 25, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: TREAT FOR 'DEAD' HEADS  </P> <P> Those carnivorous zombies from the 1968 cult classic, "Night of the Living  Dead," will return to Pittsburgh this fall, when film maker George Romero  mounts a remake to be financed by Menahem Golan's 21st Century Film Corp.  Romero has "updated" the script and will produce, but not direct again -- that  chore now goes to makeup and effects artist Tom Savini.  </P> <P> "The only major change planned is to film in color," Romero told us. He said he  reluctantly became involved in a remake "to have a hand in maintaining the  film's integrity."  </P> <P> Another motivator, he admitted: the opportunity to cash in on the film's  undying popularity, since those most closely involved with the original have  seen only a fraction of its profits.  </P> <P> "It's hardly an uncommon story," Romero added, alluding to widespread  bootlegging. "There probably isn't a week that goes by that the original isn't  playing somewhere in the world, and I can tell you that I have no idea who's  seeing that revenue." Leonard Klady  </P></p>

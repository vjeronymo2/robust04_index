However, we learned that  the humanitarian fuel will be distributed free to public  hospitals and sold at $1.20 per gallon to the private  institutions in Port-au-Prince.    Thus, the fuel crisis continues to claim victims in the  country's institutions. This week, it is the health sector that  is threatened. Saint-Francois De Salle Hospital has decided to  close its admission service and surgery unit. The hemodialysis  section has also stopped working. This unit, the only center now  available for hemodialysis which purifies the blood of patients  suffering from kidney failure, can no longer operate because of  the shortage of fuel. At the Saint-Francois De Salle Hospital,  activities were extremely slow on 24 January. This 100-bed  center is facing some extremely difficult moments according to  its director, Doctor Sainphar Bontemps. [passage omitted]    The French hospital continues to offer full services to  patients. The director, however, pointed out to us that its oil  stock could be depleted by the end of the week. [passage  omitted]. Mr. Martineau advised us that the French hospital  intends to extend its admissions of deprived people.    At the Canape-Vert Hospital, services are being maintained.  The manager of this 48-bed center says the hospital is affected  by the shortage of fuel. Jean Craan states that he had to help  colleagues who were facing urgent fuel problems this week. The  director explained that the Canape-Vert Hospital could not in  any event receive all the patients in Port-au-Prince in case the  crisis worsens in the other hospitals. Jean Craan expresses the  solidarity of the Canape-Vert Hospital with other health centers  in difficulty. [passage omitted]    Questioned as to reports regarding a possible  disqualification of the Canape-Vert Hospital in receiving  humanitarian fuel because of the social class of its patients,  Craan asserts that it would be a great mistake. He made a point  of clarifying that the doors of the hospital are open to  patients of differing social classes and that the hospital is  approved by the state.    The hospital of the State University of Haiti is also  affected by the shortage of fuel. The General Hospital is  working with a reduced staff and oil products are being  purchased at high prices while waiting for the humanitarian  fuel, according to Director General Jean Boirond.

This was a decision made easier  by the Senate's adoption, during a general foreign policy  debate, of a recommendation that this should be done, supported  in particular by veterans and former prisoners of war from both  parties.    The President needed all the help he could get on this  sensitive subject: The organizations representing families of  soldiers reported "missing in action" (MIA's) during the Vietnam  War reject this additional step toward the normalization of  relations between the former enemies, with, in particular, the  opening of American Government offices in Hanoi. [passage  omitted]    It is therefore easy to understand that the President should  start by expressing his conviction that his decision would make  a full search possible: The progress in cooperation with  Vietnam is tangible, he said, and the United States itself is  devoting more effort to this question than at any other time in  its history, the President said, citing the practical results  obtained since he came to office. His decision was the result  of careful consideration, he added, and was supported by all the  experts inside and outside the White House: Vietnam's  cooperation would be more effectively guaranteed by a policy of  "involvement," but without going as far as "normalization," than  by any continuation of the country's isolation.    Is this really the end of the famous "Vietnam syndrome?"  Many  people in the White House, the Capitol, and the country, hope  so. It is not completely certain, as demonstrated by the  hostility which the President encountered last year when he paid  his respects at the "wall," the memorial to the people who died  in that war. As the President himself admitted, a whole  generation is obsessed by the desire to know what happened to  the soldiers who never came back, after the last repatriation of  prisoners under the Nixon administration. However, over the  years, this feeling has gradually given way to the desire to "be  reconciled" with the past. [passage omitted]    For American firms, the time to rush into this market, now  described as "enormous," has certainly arrived: The big  business lobby and oil companies at Westinghouse had been  waiting impatiently for months. Forced to go through  intermediaries, they saw their competitors, especially European  competitors, establishing themselves and cleaning out this new  country in which, they note in passing, 60 percent of the  population was not born when the conflict was raging. The  Democrats' new policy, aside from a less "automatic" link  between humanitarian and commercial questions than campaign  speeches suggested, is focused on economic recovery, and hence  encouraging exports. Although President Clinton's personal  position was bound to be extremely uncomfortable in this  specific case, his decision is consistent with his priorities:  To unite the country, and in particular to heal once and for  all the emotional wounds of the Vietnam War, and to ensure  economic recovery.</p>

			<p><P> December 8, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> LOYOLA WILL FACE A TOUGH TEST AGAINST RESTED SANTA BARBARA  </P> <P> On the heels of the shoot-out Thursday with U.S. International, the Loyola  Marymount basketball team could get its toughest test since Nevada Las Vegas  when UC Santa Barbara comes to town at 7:30 p.m. Saturday.  </P> <P> Santa Barbara, off to a 3-1 start and coming off a week's rest, has found its  way into some Top 20s and has lost only to Iowa at Iowa. The Gauchos' victories  include a 23-point manhandling of Pepperdine, a 17-point win over the  University of San Diego and a 26-point blowout of Bradley. The loss to Iowa was  by six points in the championship of the Amana Classic.  </P> <P> The Gauchos defeated Loyola a year ago in Santa Barbara, 95-94.  </P> <P> Lions guard Jeff Fryer is hoping to get medical clearance to play Saturday. His  shooting hand, which has a broken bone, remains in a cast and will be  re-examined today.  </P> <P> In his absence, Hank Gathers and Bo Kimble continue to carry the scoring load,  averaging 29 and 27.5 points, and Coach Paul Westhead has gotten production  from the bench. Supersub Tom Peabody has been filling in as the starter -- as  he did much of last season when Kimble was hurt -- and Terrell Lowery is  scoring in double figures and leading the conference in assists.  </P> <P> Up front, sophomore John O'Connell has earned Coach Paul Westhead's respect,  and when O'Connell injured an ankle last week sophomore center Chris Knight  stepped up with his best performance at Loyola, scoring 12 points and hitting  several clutch shots against Jacksonville.  </P> <P> Despite the ankle injury, O'Connell played a few minutes last weekend against  Jacksonville and has practiced all week. "He was hurt badly enough to go to the  hospital for X-rays, but before the game (the next day) he told me, 'I'm ready  to go,' " Westhead said of his fellow Philadelphia native, O'Connell. "Monday  we had a hard two-hour practice and then ran some sprints, and he was the  winner in his row in every sprint. It goes to show what determination can do.  He's an old-school player. He's a Philly player from the late '60s, not the  late '80s."  </P> <P> Peabody and Lowery have been so steady off the bench that Westhead said the  team doesn't miss a beat with them in. "Lowery and Peabody have been excellent  off the bench, but we expect that," Westhead said. "It reminds me of two years  ago when we had Fryer and Enoch Simmons coming off the bench."  </P> <P> Santa Barbara, which gave UNLV a run for the Big West title two years ago and  may do so again, has a veteran lineup featuring shot-blocking forward Eric  MacArthur (12.9 points, 10.5 rebounds) and shooting guard Carrick DeHart (20.3  points, 54% on three-pointers). The other starters are forwards Lucius Davis  and Gary Gray (15 points per game) and guard Paul Johnson. DeHart, the former  Santa Monica High star, was named Big West Player of the Week after hitting a  school-record eight three-pointers against Iowa.  </P> <P> Coach Jerry Pimm uses a nine-man rotation including freshman guard Idris Jones,  the highest scorer off the bench (5.3).  </P> <P> The Loyola women will play Division II power Cal Poly Pomona at 5 p.m.  Saturday, preceding the men's game. The Loyola women, 2-2, lost two games last  weekend in New York after opening the season with two victories at home.  </P> <P> Guards Kristen Bruich and Lynn Flanagan lead the Lions in scoring, combining  for 27 points per game. Bruich averages 4.5 assists. Center Tricia Gibson is  averaging 9.8 points and 8.3 rebounds.  </P> <P> Pomona, 4-0 entering the week, is led by 6-foot-2 All-American forward Niki  Bracken (23.5 points, 9.3 rebounds), 6-1 center Marcine Edmonds and guard  Carrie Egan. Point guard Stephanie Coons, 5-11, is averaging 13.5 points and  4.8 assists.  </P></p>

Japan pledged the amount at a U.N.-sponsored meeting in  Nairobi on the establishment of an organization to coordinate  assistance to Somalia, the ministry said.    The government will provide the assistance considering the  urgent need to reconstruct Somalia's police and judicial system  and establish a system to maintain public order and restore  peace by the Somali people themselves, it said.    The U.N. Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM II), currently  deployed  to maintain the public order and secure safety of humanitarian  assistance activities, announced last October a program to  reconstruct the local police and judicial system.    The U.N. is calling on member countries to cooperate in the  program, the ministry said.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Enes Musovic from Gorazde] </F>   [Text] This morning at 0730 some 300 citizens of  (Cazagici) and (Hudjer), districts within 3 km of the Gorazde  center, started off by themselves toward their properties and  homes. As they said, they could no longer bear to listen to  daily misinformation about the chetniks having withdrawn from  their homes. They could no longer wait for someone else to  solve their problems, particularly as the UN Protection Forces  [UNPROFOR] has not tried to do this in the only correct way.    However, they were stopped in front of the (Cazagici)  district by a group of chetniks armed with machine guns, Osa and  Zolja portable rocket launchers, and hand grenades, who started  to abuse and provoke them while at the same time cocking their  guns. Very soon UNPROFOR positioned in Gorazde intervened with  transporters and a large number of soldiers, thus barring the  citizens of (Hudjer) and (Cazagici) from reaching their homes.  The situation turned very tense, but the [word indistinct]  authorities prevented the unarmed people at the last moment from  charging at the chetnik barrels.    It is obvious to everyone in Gorazde that the zone of three  km from the city center has not been cleared, that the Serbian  civilians are in fact Serb soldiers, and that they have remained  in all their positions within this zone. All in all, the  situation here is very tense and the likelihood of incidents and  bloodshed seems to be increasing by the minute.    Victor Andreyev, chief of the UNPROFOR civilian section in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, was informed about this on 7 June when he  visited Gorazde. However, UNPROFOR has done nothing about it,  and is still deceiving the world with tales that the Serbian  soldiers, Serbian police, and Serbian civilians have left the  3-km zone from the center of Gorazde.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The U.S. carriers covered by the Part 234 requirements are those generating at least 1 percent of the U.S. domestic scheduled-passenger revenues on a yearly basis. Currently, there are ten carriers reporting the data. They are Alaska Airlines, Inc. (Alaska), America West Airlines, Inc. (America West), American Airlines, Inc. (American), Continental Air Lines, Inc. (Continental), Delta Air Lines, Inc. (Delta), Northwest Airlines, Inc. (Northwest), Southwest Airlines Co. (Southwest), Trans World Airlines, Inc. (TWA), United Air Lines, Inc. (United) and USAir, Inc. (USAir). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Reportable airports are those airports in the contiguous 48 states generating at least 1 percent of the domestic scheduled-passenger enplanements on an annual basis. There are 29 reportable airports in 1994. In practice, all reporting carriers are voluntarily submitting data for their entire domestic scheduled-passenger operations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One of the main purposes of the rule is to create a market-based incentive for airlines to improve their service quality and schedule reliability for consumers. The public availability of comparative data on airline service quality creates this market-based carrier incentive. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The addition of wheels-off and wheels-on times, and the identification of aircraft by tail number, will enable the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to analyze air traffic operations and create system models for use in reducing enroute and ramp delays. Air traffic delays cost the public and the industry an estimated $8.5 billion in 1990, according to the FAA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Public Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Comments on the NPRM were received from Alaska, American, Delta, Northwest, Southwest, the Air Transport Association of America (ATA), The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (Port Authority), and America West which filed comments along with a motion for leave to file late comments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ATA is an airline trade association with 17 U.S. carrier members and two Canadian air carrier associate members. Of the ten carriers currently reporting on-time flight performance data, America West is the only non-ATA member. The ATA stated that Alaska, Northwest and Southwest did not join in ATA's comments to the NPRM. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The comments address safety, alternative data sources, the proprietary nature of aircraft tail number data, elimination of the rule in its entirety, the addition of new data items and definition changes. Each of these subjects is addressed under a separate caption. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Safety <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Northwest, Southwest and America West opposed the elimination of the mechanical exclusion. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Northwest believes the existing rule balances the need for consumer information with safety, and gives carriers an incentive to engage in realistic scheduling. Northwest states it has placed a high priority on improving its on-time performance, and has developed a comprehensive system which includes employee training to assure flights are dispatched on time. However, Northwest also states that it has, and always will place safety ahead of on-time flight performance. Consequently, it has instructed its employees to ignore on-time flight performance when safety is an issue. Northwest believes the proposed change will make on-time flight performance an issue that employees may wrongly consider when making decisions that have major safety implications. Northwest states it does not want its employees to feel pressure to choose between safety and on-time flight performance. Northwest believes the current rule is an unqualified success, and should not be amended to include mechanical delays and mechanical cancellations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Southwest believes the policy of each air carrier is ``safety first.'' However, Southwest feels a carrier cannot guarantee that an employee's commitment to safety will not be affected by a desire to see the carrier do well in its on-time flight performance. Southwest contends including mechanical delays in the reported flight records will intensify the conflict between safety and on-time performance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Southwest states the Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA) did not reveal any need for the proposed change in the treatment of mechanical delays, other than the Inspector General's (IG) audit report which found minor discrepancies in some nonreported flights. After the IG audit, RSPA issued an accounting and reporting directive on the subject of nonreported mechanical delays and mechanical cancellations. Southwest asserts a follow-up audit has not been conducted, and concludes that there is no evidence that the problem continues to exist. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

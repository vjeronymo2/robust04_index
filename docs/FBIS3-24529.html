Transformation  of E. coli with plasmid pMAL-C bearing the mst-1 gene yielded  approximately 40 mg of recombinant metastasin from 5 g of wet  cells. The recombinant product was longer than the native  peptide by an additional 13 amino acid residues on the  N-terminal end. However, its ability to bind calcium ions was  not affected. Thus, the tertiary structure of the recombinant  metastasin appears to differ little from the native protein and  should be suitable for biological investigations, including the  generation of poly- and monoclonal antibodies.

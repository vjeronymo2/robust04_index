			<p><P> February 1, 1990, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> AFTER 20 YEARS, WOMAN SQUATTER FACES EVICTION  </P> <P> A judge on Wednesday ordered the eviction of a 72-year-old woman who has been  living for nearly 20 years in a ramshackle homestead on the proposed site of a  state park.  </P> <P> Doris Gagnon was granted an automatic 20-day stay, and Superior Court Judge  Karen Sequino said it is likely the woman will be found eligible for a stay of  up to nine months.  </P> <P> During a hearing Tuesday, Gagnon said she preferred to live with dozens of  animals at her makeshift home on state property than move to senior citizen  housing.  </P> <P> Gagnon has been fighting the state since the mid-1960s, when efforts began to  establish a park on the 200-acre site along Long Island Sound. Her cottage was  demolished in 1971, but she refused to leave the area.  </P></p>

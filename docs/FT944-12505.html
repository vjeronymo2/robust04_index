			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Inspirations to launch own airline next spring Inspirations, the tour operator which floated on the Unlisted Securities Market last December, is to launch its own airline next spring. The airline, to be called International Airways, will be run by Mr Eamonn Mullaney, former managing director of Caledonian Airways, British Airways' charter airline. International Airways is to lease three new Airbus A320 aircraft, to be delivered in April 1995. Mr Vic Fatah, Inspirations' chief executive, said the launch of the airline posed no threat to the company's future. He said other airlines which had run into trouble, such as Laker Airways, Air Europe and Dan-Air, had done so because of problems with scheduled services. International Airways will operate only in the charter market. Mr Fatah said Inspirations had decided to launch the airline because the price of chartering other companies' aircraft had risen in recent months. He did not think the increases were a temporary phenomenon. The company said the three aircraft would accommodate nearly all Inspirations' winter customers. Mr Mullaney said, however, that the aircraft would give Inspirations slightly more capacity than it needed for its own summer customers. The reason for the disparity was that winter flying involved using the aircraft to reach long-haul destinations such as India. Summer flights were to destinations such as Palma in Majorca, which is near enough for one aircraft to make the same journey several times in a day. The company would have no difficulty selling the excess summer seats to other tour operators, said Mr Mullaney. The new airline would not be dependent on rival tour operators to fill excess capacity on its winter flights as all seats could, if necessary, be taken up by Inspirations' customers. Mr Fatah said that Inspirations was on target to fulfil its flotation undertaking that it would acquire or start up 50 travel agency outlets in its first year. He said the company had 47 retail outlets so far, which were being run by the travel agency chain AT Mays.</p>

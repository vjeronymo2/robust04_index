			<p>Language: <F P=105> Latvian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Janis Kulmanis: "Prime Ministers See Danger for </F> the Baltic States"]    [Text] Riga, 19 Jan -- The words uttered on Tuesday [18  January] by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev regarding  "serious interests" in the former Soviet republics and partial  retention of Russian troops in some of those republics have  received sharp criticism. During their meeting in Jurmala  today, the Baltic prime ministers made a statement concluding  that Kozyrev's declaration means that "the very essence of the  `Partnership for Peace' plan proposed by the United States and  accepted at the NATO summit in Brussels, as well as the building  of new structures for European safety, have become questionable."    The prime ministers voiced the opinion that this "new  attitude" toward relations with the Baltic States will  complicate the negotiations on Russian withdrawal from Latvia  and Estonia. "Such statements by Russia regarding foreign and  military policy are aimed directly against the sovereignty of  the Baltic states," reads the declaration signed by the Baltic  prime ministers. The statement also includes a demand that  Russia keep its promise to withdraw its military units from  Latvia and Estonia by 31 August 1994.    As was admitted at a press conference by Maris Riekstins,  state secretary of the Latvian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the  statements on Tuesday by A. Kozyrev might be regarded as his  characteristic style. M. Riekstins recalled the end of 1992,  when A. Kozyrev presented a scenario in Stockholm of what would  happen if nationalist radicals assumed power in Russia. These  statements were later disavowed. M. Riekstins said that the  Foreign Ministry is in possession of information about several  Russian Foreign Ministry officials who, in expressing their own  opinions, have tried to counteract Kozyrev's statement. M.  Riekstins assumed that what Kozyrev said was his own view of  last week's summit of NATO leaders. It "did not solve the  acceptance of different countries in East Europe into this  organization." The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is not in  possession of the precise text of Kozyrev's speech; officials  will probably have it on Thursday.    Anxiety in connection with A. Kozyrev's speech was also  expressed by the Lithuanian Foreign Ministry, as reported by  BNS. "There is an impression that Russia has not resolved to  give up its military influence in the Baltic states. It is odd  that this statement has been made after the meeting of the  presidents of the United States and Russia, and at the same time  the new Russian parliament is beginning its work," reads a  statement issued by the Lithuanian Foreign Ministry. A member  of the Lithuanian Seimas [parliament], Romualds Ozols, expressed  the view that Lithuania should declare strictly that it does not  intend to cooperate with Russia in the military field. Anxiety  over Kozyrev's speech was also expressed by the Estonian Foreign  Ministry.    Already on Tuesday, an assumption was expressed that the  recent conduct of Russia, which contradicts the previous policy  towards the Baltic states, might be connected with the latest  meeting of the Russian and U.S. presidents, as well as the  possible agreement on this question, therefore an official  statement from the United States regarding Kozyrev's statement  was impatiently awaited. Today, the U.S. State Department  declared: "The statement by Minister Kozyrev contradicts what  was said at the meeting of the two presidents in Moscow." The  statement says that during his meeting with Russian President  Boris Yeltsin, U.S. President Bill Clinton stressed the  immediate and complete withdrawal of Russian troops from Latvia  and Estonia. M. Riekstins said at a press conference that the  U.S. State Department has requested a formal explanation of A.  Kozyrev's speech.    The head of Latvia's delegation to withdrawal negotiations  with Russia, Martins Virsis, said at the press conference that  it is difficult to foretell how this statement might affect the  talks between Latvia and Russia. "If this radical conceptual  attitude is maintained, Latvia will apparently be forced to  think the whole situation over and possibly change its  position." M. Virsis refused further comment on the subject.</p>

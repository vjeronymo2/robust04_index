			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANYTHING FOR A PAL;  </P> <P> THE LION AT THE DOOR BY NEWTON THORNBURG (WILLIAM MORROW: $18.95; 288 PP.;  0-688-08820-1)  </P> <P> In Newton Thornburg's latest suspense novel, big, strong, decent Tom Kohl sits  in a Seattle bar with his cousin, Ken, and Ken's girlfriend, Diane. They are  enjoying a light moment in the midst of darkening tragedy. Ken, driving drunk,  has run over a pedestrian and fled rather than notify the police. The victim  has turned out to be a gangster.  </P> <P> Kohl has gone along with the cover-up out of loyalty to Ken, a childhood  playmate who took him in after Kohl's parents died and he lost the family farm  in Illinois. Now, in the bar, Ken tells Diane jokingly about how Kohl, on a  high school football team called the Lions, was twice named Most Valuable Lion,  and we hear an unexpected note:  </P> <P> "As (Kohl) remembered those brisk Friday nights under the lights, there was  only one lion out on that field, and it was fear: fear of the coach and the  crowd, fear of failure, and fear of success -- fear of life finally."  </P> <P> Later, when the bodies -- including Ken's -- have begun to pile up, we hear it  again:  </P> <P> "(Kohl) was only now beginning to understand what Ken's death meant for him. .  . . There was no one left now who really knew him. . . . (He realized) how  totally alone he was, how bereft of his own life, his own past. . . . And he  suddenly understood the old men who sat in bars talking at each other, never  listening, pathetically trying to unburden themselves of histories known only  to them, tales they would have to take to their graves."  </P> <P> Such sensitivity and insight don't usually come in the same package with a guy  who can harvest corn, build houses, overhaul diesel engines, pilot a boat and  single-handedly dismantle an underworld empire, but the combination isn't new  for Thornburg, who demonstrates again what good reading can be found on the  border between genre literature and the real thing.  </P> <P> Thornburg's specialty is to have a relatively innocent person stumble across a  crime. In "To Die in California," a farmer refused to accept that his son's  death was an accident. In "Cutter and Bone," a bitter Vietnam veteran and his  womanizing pal pushed their pursuit of a murder suspect to the point of  obsession, tainting themselves in the process. Elements of both plots are  recycled in "The Lion at the Door."  </P> <P> For most of this novel, Thornburg's border-straddling pays off. Along with the  swift prose and guaranteed action of the suspense genre, he gives us vivid  descriptions of Seattle and the Midwest and some acute and nasty commentary on  how blue-collar workers went broke during the '80s while yuppies flourished. He  has a good ear, too: Rural tycoons, black go-go dancers and Mafiosi all speak  in convincing voices.  </P> <P> The major characters are satisfyingly complex. If Ken weren't handsome but  weak; if Diane weren't smart but cold; if Bobbi, the cocktail waitress who  witnessed the cover-up, weren't flaky but country-shrewd -- in fact, if the  bumpers on Kohl's pickup truck weren't extra stout -- the plot couldn't advance  as it does. Yet everyone has valid personal reasons for his behavior, so that  plot seems to grow out of character as much as the other way around.  </P> <P> Only toward the end does this balance wobble. If Kohl weren't decent, he  wouldn't stick by Ken; if he weren't big and strong, he wouldn't be able to  avenge him. But even the beefiest ex-farmers aren't likely to win repeatedly in  hand-to-hand combat with professional thugs. It isn't Kohl's down-home grit  that propels him through his final heroics, but the runaway machinery of the  plot.  </P> <P> This may be a sign that Thornburg is getting bored with his specialty, careless  about its demands or impatient with its limitations. Kohl is too nice a guy for  the bloody task he is given; the price we pay for the excitement of the genre  is to have him turn into a fantasy figure for a while.  </P> <P> It's not a high price, in a novel as skillful and intelligent as this one. But  it does make us wonder which side of the border Thornburg is going to work on  next time.  </P></p>

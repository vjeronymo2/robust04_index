			<p><P> December 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOVIET TV TO MARK CHRISTMAS EVE WITH A SERMON TAPED BY SCHULLER  </P> <P> The Rev. Robert H. Schuller said Saturday that the "high point" of his life  came when he heard that a 15-minute sermon he taped earlier this month in  Moscow would be aired on Soviet television tonight -- Christmas Eve.  </P> <P> The broadcast by the Garden Grove televangelist will be the first of its kind  to be shown to the 200 million viewers of state-owned Soviet television on a  Christian holiday.  </P> <P> Schuller said he received a telephone call early Saturday morning from Valentin  Lazutkin, deputy chief of Gostelradio, the state television agency, informing  him that the 15-minute sermon he videotaped during a three-day visit to Moscow  in early December would be aired tonight at 10 p.m. in Moscow.  </P> <P> "I don't think anything will happen in my life that will top this -- this will  be the high point," said Schuller, pastor at the Crystal Cathedral in Garden  Grove. "This makes me feel so good I could cry with joy."  </P> <P> Because of the time difference, the Soviet broadcast will begin just as today's  first service at the Crystal Cathedral is ending, and a moment of prayer will  be offered for the Soviet viewers, he said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 6, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OFFSHORE DRILLING AND OIL TANKERS  </P> <P> Your editorial ("More Preventable Spills," June 27) on oil spills rightly  emphasized prevention as the first line of defense against spills. However, you  incorrectly suggested that oil companies are neglecting preventive measures in  favor of spill containment.  </P> <P> To the contrary, we view prevention as critical in reducing pollution from  tankers. The industry's new $250 million oil spill program places a heavy  emphasis on avoiding tanker accidents through recommended changes in our own  tanker operations and in government activities regarding tankers.  </P> <P> Our proposals include a preventive step that you recommend: mandatory  participation in the Coast Guard advisory vessel traffic systems and the  possible expansion of these systems into ports and harbors that need them. We  also are calling for study of alternative tanker designs such as double  bottoms, double sides and smaller tanks for vessels by an independent body such  as the National Academy of Sciences. We are proposing other preventive measures  including requiring maneuvering assistance from tugboats where extraordinary  navigation hazards exist, stricter pilot standards, better training for tanker  personnel and drug and alcohol testing.  </P> <P> The industry also is creating a new spill response organization for U.S. waters  -- designed particularly for major spills but on call for any spill -- and it  will fund $30 million to $35 million worth of research in prevention and  cleanup over the next five years.  </P> <P> V.

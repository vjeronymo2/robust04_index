			<p><P> January 21, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HOMEOWNERS, CHARITY AND SHARE OUR SELVES  </P> <P> There were 1,000 "unselfish" people at the SOS rally on Jan. 13. I'm sure most  of those people are for keeping SOS at the Rea Community Center in West Side  Costa Mesa. It draws the homeless, the parolees and alcoholics away from their  safe, quiet and "unselfish" neighborhoods.  </P> <P> We, in our small, "selfish" little neighborhood, are but a small voice trying  to be heard over the great uproar of the richer who employ many West Side  residents; the many Orange County churches involved; the tilted media coverage;  and Jean Forbath and other SOS directors -- the most "unselfish" of all, of  course.  </P> <P> It seems to me that if some of these other more "unselfish" areas of the county  had not closed their facilities or would put their action and money where their  mouth and heart literally are, at home, we in our "selfish" little neighborhood  would not be so desperate to be heard.  </P> <P> I'm for keeping this type of organization out of all those "unselfish"  residential neighborhoods, fearing they may become "selfish." We know how  quickly the Mesa Verde neighborhood of Costa Mesa seemed almost to act  "selfish" when mention was made to move there. That is Forbath's own  neighborhood -- forbid!  </P> <P> A man signed our petition Saturday who did not live in West Side Costa Mesa. He  thought maybe he should not. I asked if he was for residential neighborhoods  being safe and quiet. He was! I told him that he could sign, that perhaps SOS  might have some signatures from outside West Side Costa Mesa also.  </P> <P> I would like to commend this "heartless" Costa Mesa City Council and citizenry  for listening with wisdom and compassion to fellow citizens and not bowing to  outside financial, religious and "unselfish" pressure.  </P> <P> Everyone says the homeless will not go away. I believe this also. I just want  them to disperse from in front of my home and allow the whole country to show  how "unselfish" it is.  </P> <P> LEE LITTRELL  </P> <P> Costa Mesa  </P></p>

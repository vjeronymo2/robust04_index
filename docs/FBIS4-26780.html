			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Zhou Lixian (0719 4539 2009)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 21 Jun (XINHUA) -- Ren Jianxin, member of  the CPC Central Committee Secretariat and chairman of the  Central Committee on Politics and Law, said here today that it  is necessary to treat the campaign for publicizing and educating  people on the legal system's importance as a long-term task and  be persistent in carrying it out. He also said that further  efforts should be made to strengthen the publicity campaign to  enhance people's common knowledge about various legal aspects  and continuously achieve more solid effects so as to keep step  with the development of legal system construction in China.    Ren Jianxin's comments came in a speech at a forum marking  the first anniversary of the "Educational Corps for Assisting  the State's Middle- and High-Ranking Cadres To Study Law." Ren  Jianxin said: The effort to publicize and educate people on the  legal system's importance is a basic task in China's legal  system construction. It is also a major characteristic of our  legal system construction. The corps was formed at a time when  China is accelerating its pace to establish a socialist market  economy. The corps is a good way to promote the campaign for  publicizing and educating people on the legal system's  importance, help the broad masses of cadres, and particularly  middle- and high-ranking cadres, enhance their legal sense of  the market economy's importance. The work, which is organized  by the Propaganda Department, the Justice Ministry, and the  China Law Society, is of great significance.    Ren Jianxin pointed out: During the course of establishing  and perfecting a socialist economic system, we should popularize  legal knowledge about the market economy, enhance people's legal  sense of importance about the market economy, maintain social  stability, and guarantee proper order of the market economy. It  is an important task to publicize and educate people on the  legal system's importance. The task will remain so for a long  time to come. Extensive efforts should be made to instill the  idea of the legal system into the minds of citizens, and  particularly leading cadres, so that leading cadres at all  levels will foster the legal system idea for a socialist market  economy. Practice proves that whether or not leading cadres at  all levels have a sense of importance about the legal system and  their ability to make decisions and carry out their duties in  accordance with the law play an important role in promoting  socialist modernization. It is impossible for a leader who does  not understand the law or who has never used legal means to  manage economic and social affairs to become a good and  conscientious leader. He expressed his hopes that, through  conducting classes on the legal system, the teachers of the  corps will not only help leaders of the organs of the CPC  Central Committee and the state as well as leaders at  provincial, municipal, and autonomous regional levels master  legal knowledge but also further foster an idea of the market  economy. It is imperative to let leading cadres at all levels  have a better understanding of the fact that a sound legal  system is needed to guarantee the establishment and perfection  of a socialist market system. In an attempt to establish and  develop a socialist market economy, all leading cadres must take  a lead in studying law, using law, and carrying out duties in  accordance with the law.    It was learned that, since the corps' establishment, 13  senior lecturers have given more than 10 lectures on the legal  system to leading cadres of the CPC Central Committee and state  organs, including the Geology and Mineral Resources Ministry and  the State Meteorological Bureau, as well as to major responsible  comrades of Jiangsu, Guangzhou, Nanjing, and other localities.  These lectures include corporate law, regulations on the change  of operating mechanisms in state-owned industrial enterprises,  amendments to the Constitution, and stocks and bonds. On top of  that, another 11 senior lecturers have recorded 13 video  lectures on the legal system regarding the market economy. The  videotaped lectures have been released to 27 provinces,  autonomous regions, and municipalities across the country.    The forum was jointly sponsored by the Propaganda  Department,  the Justice Ministry, and the China Law Society. China Law  Society Chairman Zou Yu presided over the meeting. Justice  Minister Xiao Yang also spoke at the meeting. Some members of  the corps also expressed their opinions and suggestions about  improving the campaign.</p>

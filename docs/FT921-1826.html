			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Viewers left cold by heated polemic - Paul Cheeseright pays his second visit to the Martins, a family in the west Midlands. When the campaign started, they had not decided who they would vote for THE FIRST week of the campaign has done nothing to clarify the issues and the Martins one way or the other. If anything, the question has been made more complicated by the heat of polemics and by the rush of contrary promises. But the parties' portrayal of themselves and their personalities through television has been reaching Lyn and Tony and their son Russell, who is voting for the first time. The Liberal Democrats' attempt to push Mr Ashdown forward as a civilising political influence clearly attracted Russell. 'He's the thinking man's politician.' And Mr Major has come across just as intended: the man who somehow understands. 'I like the man because he's been there and done it. He's seen life on the streets,' said Russell. Yet they like Mr Kinnock more than previously. 'Neil Kinnock has changed his image in the last few days', said Tony. 'He got a bad press early on. He's mellowed his attitude.' 'He's talking to you instead of at you,' noted Lyn, with implied approval of the pitch that the party is not just Neil, but Neil heading the team. And because the Martins want to be talked to, to be reasoned with, they are getting pretty fed up with the hectoring of the campaign. 'Some of the programmes that have been on the TV. Ridiculous,' snorted Tony. 'They're just slagging each other off.' 'All one is concerned about is knocking the other one,' added Lyn, with particular reference to the televised confrontation between Mr Roy Hattersley and Mr Michael Howard on Central TV last Monday, with Mr Tom McNally of the Liberal Democrats stuck in the middle. Monday was also the day of Labour's alternative Budget. The Martins had been dismissive of Mr Lamont's real one and they were not much more complimentary about Mr Smith's effort. 'Both parties are doing something about the taxes,' Lyn acknowledged. But, comparing the two, 'there wasn't a lot in it as to how it would work out for us'. That is largely because, with a gross income of around Pounds 20,000 between them, Lyn and Tony are neither poor enough nor rich enough to be much affected by tinkering with the tax of either the low-paid or the high-paid. Russell, though, likes Labour's plan for 50 per cent tax on incomes over Pounds 40,000. 'That is a really good idea. It helps even things out a bit.' By Thursday, the concern of the Martins had swung back to schools, if only because they spent the evening at a parent-teacher meeting on behalf of Westley, 14, their second son. He goes to Lyndon School in Solihull. Lyn and Tony are very happy with both Lyndon and St Margaret's Church of England Primary where, Keeley, 10, their daughter goes. This means they are ambivalent about the changes Conservative policy might bring about. They have no problems about the core curriculum and enthuse about spending more on education. But opting out is more difficult. 'If they did want to abolish local education authorities, they'd still have to have a group to manage the schools which are left,' said Lyn. All of which bore out the general point that, as Lyn said, 'each party has a good point or a few good points.' And that led Tony to conclude, 'I think it's going to be close.'</p>

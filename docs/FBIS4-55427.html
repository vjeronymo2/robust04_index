			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Prague HOSPODARSKE NOVINY in Czech on  12 May on page 36, under the headline "Hopes of This Summer in  Croatia," carries a 1,500-word interview with Croatian Prime  Minister Nikica Valentic by Jirina Shrbena. The date of the  interview, which took place in the Croatian resort town of  Makarska, is not given. The topics discussed are solely of an  economic character.    In the introduction, the author observes that prior to his  appointment, Valentic was director general of the INA  petrochemical plant, and that, over the 14 months in office, he  managed to stabilize the economy of Croatia and launch its  fundamental transformation. Privatization has started and,  albeit with some problems, the banks are being financially  consolidated.    "For seven months now, Croatia has recorded zero growth in  consumer prices and, according to the prime minister, the annual  rate of inflation will not exceed 10 percent. Foreign currency  reserves increased from zero to $1.6 billion, and are expected  to reach $2 billion before the year is over. The prime minister  does not consider the country's foreign debt amounting to $2.8  billion to be a significant problem, especially if tourism can  be brought up to its former level. Valentic regards this year's  season to be a test of the Croation economy." While "this  year's tourism revenues are expected to exceed 2 billion German  marks [DM], they should reach the prewar level -- i.e., DM6  billion -- within a few years." Asked about the protection of  foreign investment, Valentic said that "the government provides  all the guarantees including the transfer of earnings abroad."  He emphasized the internal convertibility that will also apply  to the new monetary unit, the kuna, which will replace the dinar  on 30 May. Replying to a question regarding the restrictions  choking down business activities, Valentic said: "In order to  reduce the inflation of 50 percent per month to 10 percent per  year, we had to adopt radical measures. Rather than artificial,  these measures are based exclusively on the economic basis. It  is a combination of anti-inlationary steps in the monetary,  fiscal, and wage spheres." Valentic also emphasized that a tax  reform was launched -- the tax legislation is harmonized with  the European standard, and the rates will be gradually reduced.  Furthermore, according to him, "the orientation of the Croatian  economic policy is clear and, I believe, correct, and we do not  intend to change it."    The fact that "so far, the country managed to bear the  burden  of the conflict without any financial assistance from abroad,"  is explained by the prime minister by "the existence of small  farms working 3 million hectares of land and producing double  the amount of food Croatia consumes." Additional help is  provided by Croatia's own oil and gas covering 20 percent of the  total consumption, and the source of foreign currency in the  form of 3 million Croats living abroad, who are responsible for  an inflow of DM3 billion per year. Of course, the demand for  capital is much higher and, according to Valentic, "Croatia has  a moral right to foreign assistance." The first foreign credit  in the amount of $138 million should be obtained from the World  Bank in June, and additional credits of between $400 and $500  million from the IMF should follow before the end of the year.  Refugees are a great financial burden, but a large part of the  original 600,000 people already returned to their homes. The  prime minister considers the return of the territory occupied by  Serbs a necessary condition for solving this problem and  normalization of the situation. "The principle of inviolability  of the border must be the golden principle," he said.</p>

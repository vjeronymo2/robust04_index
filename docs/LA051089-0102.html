			<p><P> May 10, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NBC'S WEISMAN FIRED BY EBERSOL, O'NEIL NAMED EXECUTIVE PRODUCER  </P> <P> Michael Weisman, executive producer of NBC sports since 1983, was fired  Tuesday.  </P> <P> He will be replaced by Terry O'Neil, a former sports producer at both ABC and  CBS who has run his own production company the last few years. O'Neil will take  over May 30.  </P> <P> Dick Ebersol, named president of NBC sports a month ago, said he made the  change because of his 20-year association with O'Neil.  </P> <P> Ebersol said there were no other candidates for the position and that he  probably would not have made the change had O'Neil turned him down.  </P> <P> Ebersol, 41, and O'Neil, 39, worked together at ABC sports early in their  careers.  </P> <P> Said Ebersol: "I decided that my first major decision as president of NBC  sports was to form my own team. Terry and I first crossed paths early in the  '70s, when he succeeded me as a researcher for the Summer Olympics."  </P> <P> O'Neil was best known at CBS as the coordinating producer of National Football  League telecasts. John Madden's gimmick, called the CBS Chalkboard, was  O'Neil's idea.  </P> <P> Ebersol met with Weisman for about 20 minutes Tuesday afternoon to give him the  news.  </P> <P> Said Weisman: "What happened was that Dick called me into his office and said,  in effect, we haven't worked together, your work is terrific, but I decided I  need my own guy to work with. I was almost not insulted."  </P> <P> Said Ebersol: "I can't imagine anyone taking it in a more classy manner.  Michael and I are friends and I hope we can maintain a relationship with him in  much the way NBC sports has with Don Ohlmeyer (the executive producer before  Weisman)."  </P> <P> Ohlmeyer Communications produces such sports programming as the Skins Game and  the Senior Skins Game for NBC.  </P> <P> O'Neil said he got a call soon after Ebersol was named NBC sports president  April 10.  </P> <P> "At first, I wasn't sure I wanted the job," O'Neil said. "But Dick is very  persuasive."  </P> <P> Weisman has 2 1/2 years left on a contract that reportedly pays him more than  $600,000 a year.  </P> <P> Employees at NBC in New York said Weisman was visibly shaken when he left the  building.

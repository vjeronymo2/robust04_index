			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Henderson Admin 40% ahead after TR buy A LOSS OF pension fund clients failed to stop Henderson Administration Group, the fund management group, from enjoying a 40 per cent jump in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 6.55m to Pounds 9.17m in the six months to September 30. The company said client withdrawals lost it about Pounds 500m of pension fund money. This was 'partly due to the expected withdrawals following the Touche Remnant acquisition, partly due to a move to indexation by some clients but also to the residual effects of our previous period of underperformance'. However, funds under management at September 30 were Pounds 12.2bn, compared with Pounds 7.3bn at the interim stage last year. An important factor in the increase was the acquisition of Touche Remnant, which brought in Pounds 2.2bn of funds. Strong stock markets and inflows in the non-pension fund side also helped. At end-September the company had Pounds 4.4bn of pension funds under management, Pounds 3.2bn of investment trusts and about Pounds 2bn of unit trusts. After the end of the half, the group launched its first investment trust under the combined Henderson TR banner and raised Pounds 100m for a Japanese smaller companies fund. Total revenues for the first half were Pounds 30.3m, against Pounds 20.5m, which did not include a full contribution from TR. Operating expenses were Pounds 22.2m (Pounds 16.7m) but the company said the best comparison was with last year's second half figure of Pounds 21.3m, which it cited as evidence that it was controlling costs. Net interest receivable slumped to Pounds 944,000 (Pounds 2.46m) because of lower interest rates and the cost of the TR acquisition. After tax of Pounds 3.1m (Pounds 2.82m), earnings per share were 28.23p (21.38p). The interim dividend is being maintained at 12.5p.</p>

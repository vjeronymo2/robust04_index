			<p>BFN     [Text] Harare June 2 SAPA -- Sub-Saharan Africa should  reduce its dependence on foreign assistance as it has exhausted  its capacity to borrow external funds, the Global Coalition for  Africa [GCA] says in its annual report. "Sub-Saharan Africa has  low savings, low investment, falling per capita GDP and relies  heavily on foreign resources. This must change. The region has  exhausted its capacity to borrow external funds on market terms.  And concessional aid, already down from its peak, may fall even  more i? the years ahead," the Zimbabwe News Agency Ziana quoted  the GCA's 1993 report as saying.    Armed conflict had stifled development, drained resources  and  impoverished many African countries, the GCA said. Even after  conflicts ended many countries had to undertake massive  reconstruction programmes to repatriate refugees, resettle  displaced persons and demobilise and re-integrate combatants.  "The estimated 5.4 million refugees in Africa are evidence of  the suffering. Unable to lead reproductive lives in their own  countries, they burden host governments and the international  community."    GCA executive director Boubakar Daiby-Outtara emphasised the  need for Africa to mobilise its own resources to compliment  those received from abroad. "African countries should clearly  see the need to take charge of their own priorities."</p>

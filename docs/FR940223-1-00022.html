 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) Multiply the butter price by the yield factor used under the Price Support Program for determining the butterfat component of the whey value in the cheese price computation; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) Subtract from the edible whey price the processing cost used under the Price Support Program for edible whey and multiply any positive difference by the yield factor used under the Price Support Program for edible whey.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The gross value of milk used to manufacture butter-nonfat dry milk shall be the sum of the following computations:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) Multiply the butter price by the yield factor used under the Price Support Program for butter; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) Multiply the nonfat dry milk price by the yield factor used under the Price Support Program for nonfat dry milk.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Determine the amounts by which the gross value per hundredweight of milk used to manufacture cheddar cheese and the gross value per hundredweight of milk used to manufacture butter-nonfat dry milk for the first 15 days of the preceding month exceed or are less than the respective gross values for the first 15 days of the second preceding month.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Compute weighting factors to be applied to the changes in gross values determined pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section by determining the relative proportion that the data included in each of the following paragraphs is of the total of the data represented in paragraphs (b)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Combine the total American cheese production for the States of Minnesota and Wisconsin, as reported by the Statistical Reporting Service of the Department for the most recent preceding period, and divide by the yield factor used under the Price Support Program for cheddar cheese to determine the quantity of milk used in the production of American cheddar cheese; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Combine the total nonfat dry milk production for the States of Minnesota and Wisconsin, as reported by the Statistical Reporting Service of the Department for the most recent preceding period, and divide by the yield factor used under the Price Support Program for nonfat dry milk to determine the quantity of milk used in the production of butter-nonfat dry milk.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Compute a weighted average of the changes in gross values per hundredweight of milk determined pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section in accordance with the relative proportions of milk determined pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;1124.51a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> [Removed]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 13.

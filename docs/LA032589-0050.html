A controversial politician, Vanden Boeynants was prime minister from 1966  to 1968 and again from 1978 to 1979.  </P> <P> The spokesman said there were three elements which led to Vander Elst's arrest.  </P> <P> He had seen some of the suspected kidnapers after they had rented a villa in  the northern French resort of Le Touquet, where Vanden Boeynants was manacled  to a wall during his captivity. The lawyer had also received phone calls from  public booths in Le Touquet.  </P> <P> In addition his fingerprints were found in a Brussels apartment police think  the gang used when it planned the kidnaping.  </P> <P> Haemers, billed as Belgium's public enemy No. 1, has been on the run since  escaping from police custody 19 months ago.  </P></p>

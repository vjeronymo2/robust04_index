			<p><P> December 3, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> NET NOTABLES  </P> <P> South Bay prep basketball facts and figures:  </P> <P>  Bombs away: Rolling Hills guard Steve Clover ranks fourth in CIF-Southern  Section career three-point shots with 148 and second in season three-pointers  with 104 in 1988-89. Former Glendora star Tracy Murray (now at UCLA) leads both  categories with 224 and 125.  </P> <P> Chips off the old block: Miraleste's point guard, sophomore Frankie White, is  the son of former Harbor College Coach Jim White. One of the young talents in  Carson is 6-2 sophomore Rudolph Washington, son of Iowa assistant coach and  ex-USC assistant Rudy Washington.  </P> <P> Norseman's delight: It will all come together Dec. 27 when Wyking (The Viking)  Jones leads the St. Bernard Vikings in the Viking Christmas Tournament at  Valley High in Las Vegas.  </P> <P> It's about time: After 15 years as a head coach, Rich Masson of Carson finally  has a player taller than 6-5 on his team. He's 6-7 1/2 sophomore Kharey  Stanley.  </P> <P> Travelin' men: Transfers expected to make an impact this season include 6-3  senior Tony Mitchell of Morningside, the leading scorer for Marshall  Fundamental last year; 6-5 senior Adrian McCovey of Leuzinger, who played in  the strong Fremont program; and 6-3 senior Tate Seefried of El Segundo,  formerly of Spokane, Wash., and Rolling Hills.  </P> <P> Good bloodlines: Rolling Hills' sixth man, 6-2 senior Jim Butler, is the  brother of former Titan standouts Dave (ex-UC Berkeley) and Greg Butler (New  York Knicks, ex-Stanford).  </P> <P> Waiting game: Serra Coach Dwan Hurt says senior guard Kenny Davis received five  offers from Division I colleges, including Cal State Fullerton, during the  early one-week signing period, but will wait until after the season to make a  decision.  </P> <P> Torrid Tartar: Torrance guard Rick Robison ranked second in the South Bay last  season with a 28.6-point average and 94 three-point shots, including nine in  one game.  </P> <P> Don't ask: San Pedro Coach Jack Kordich on the academic ineligibility of 6-6,  240-pound junior Sean Goodwin, a highly touted transfer from Miraleste: "If you  think about it, it just makes you sick. It just tears you apart. I can't think  about it."  </P> <P> Winning Warren: In four seasons at Rolling Hills, Coach Cliff Warren has  records of 92-22 overall, 41-5 in the Bay League and 11-4 in the CIF playoffs.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 15, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHINA ORDERS 2 U.S. REPORTERS OUT OF COUNTRY  </P> <P> In action that further escalates tension between Washington and Beijing on  issues of human rights and national sovereignty, China issued expulsion orders  Wednesday for two U.S. correspondents on charges that they violated martial-law  restrictions on press coverage.  </P> <P> Alan W. Pessin, Beijing bureau chief of the U.S. government-funded Voice of  America, and Associated Press reporter John Pomfret were summoned to a Beijing  city office in the afternoon and told they must leave China within 72 hours.  </P> <P> The action came after several days of blistering attacks in the Chinese media  against Voice of America, which broadcasts to a huge Chinese audience in both  English and Chinese.  </P> <P> In Washington, China's ambassador, Han Xu, was summoned to the State Department  to receive a "vigorous" protest of the expulsions. However, State Department  spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said the Bush Administration had no plans to  retaliate against any of the 38 Chinese journalists working in the United  States. She said a similar protest would be delivered by the U.S. Embassy in  Beijing to the Chinese Foreign Ministry this morning.  </P> <P> She emphasized that both Pomfret and Pessin were fully accredited  correspondents with Chinese visas authorizing them to work in the country.  </P> <P> The choice of two U.S. reporters as expulsion targets seemed tied to Chinese  anger at Washington for granting refuge in the U.S. Embassy to astrophysicist  Fang Lizhi, China's most prominent pro-democracy activist, and his wife, Li  Shuxian, a Beijing University physics professor.  </P> <P> In the wake of a bloody June 3-4 crackdown on student-led pro-democracy  protests, the Chinese government has issued arrest warrants for Fang and Li,  and bitterly condemned the U.S. action as interference in China's internal  affairs.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Baker Called 'Confident'  </P> <P> A senior State Department official in Washington was quoted as saying Wednesday  that Secretary of State James A. Baker III believes "there are reasons to be  hopeful" that the United States and China can reach an agreement permitting  Fang and his wife to leave the embassy without risking arrest. The official,  who spoke to news agency correspondents on the understanding he would not be  identified by name, did not list the reasons.  </P> <P> He said that, if necessary, the embassy is prepared to shelter Fang and his  wife for an extended period. "We went into it with our eyes open," he said.  </P> <P> Since declaring martial law in Beijing on May 20, Chinese authorities have  issued a variety of press restrictions intended to limit coverage of the  violent suppression of a pro-democracy student movement that began in  mid-April.  </P> <P> The restrictions were widely ignored, however, when the Chinese army swept into  central Beijing late on June 3 and early June 4, shooting into crowds of  citizens seeking to block its way.  </P> <P> Hundreds, perhaps thousands, died in the assault. The Chinese Red Cross  initially estimated the death toll at 2,600, a figure that is still given  considerable credibility in diplomatic circles.  </P> <P> A few days after the incident, a top government spokesman asserted that only  about 300 people had died.  </P> <P> Wednesday, Chinese authorities further reduced the official death figure to  around 200.  </P> <P> The official New China News Agency carried a news release from the "Propaganda  Department" of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party  that gave a detailed account of widespread destruction of army vehicles and  said that nearly 100 soldiers and policemen were killed by  "counterrevolutionary" rioters. "Some 100 civilians" also died, the report  added.  </P> <P> The expulsions of Pessin and Pomfret came against this background.  </P> <P> Pessin, 33, was accused of "conducting illegal press coverage after martial law  was declared" and "writing news stories to distort facts, spread rumor and  incite and stir up turmoil and counterrevolutionary rebellion," the New China  News Agency reported.  </P> <P> Pessin told reporters in Beijing that he had responded to his accusers with  this statement: "We report the best, most accurate, the fairest and the  best-balanced news that we possibly can. The only motive that we have is to  tell the truth as best we can. Governments do not always like that. To say that  Voice of America is maliciously creating rumors and has ulterior motives is  itself a malicious rumor, apparently with ulterior motives."  </P> <P> VOA Director Richard Carlson told reporters that the expulsions were "a step  backward for the media in China, which over the past couple of years have  demonstrated some steps forward."  </P> <P> He added: "We think it's very unfortunate and sad, in fact, for the Chinese  people, who in the tens of millions depend on the Voice of America and the BBC  and some other outside broadcasters for what has been extremely reliable,  straightforward, factual, unbiased accounts" of the turmoil in their country.  </P> <P> Pomfret, 30, was accused of "having frequent contacts with illegal organization  leaders, passing on information to and providing shelter for them" and  "obtaining state secrets through illegal means," the New China News Agency  said.  </P> <P> Pomfret said he also was accused of giving protection to Wuer Kaixi, a key  leader of the seven-week-long pro-democracy student protests. Chinese  authorities have charged Wuer with counterrevolutionary activities and issued a  warrant for his arrest.  </P> <P> Pomfret, who speaks fluent Chinese, wrote a profile of Wuer before the  martial-law crackdown and interviewed him several times during the  demonstrations.  </P> <P> "I did my job as a journalist and I worked hard," Pomfret said. "It's a shame  that these are the results I get."  </P> <P> Louis D. Boccardi, president and general manager of the Associated Press, said  in New York: "We deplore and have protested in the strongest terms to the  Chinese government this unwarranted assault on fair and factual reporting."  </P> <P> At the White House, press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said: "We believe these  journalists were trying to print the truth of the situation in China. Actions  such as this, the harassment of journalists trying to do their jobs and  attempts to jam VOA broadcasts, will not succeed in keeping the truth about  what is going on in China from being heard in that troubled land or throughout  the world."  </P> <P> Vernon Mann, a reporter for London-based Independent Television News, was  restricted to his hotel Wednesday in the central city of Chengdu after being  detained Tuesday for recording scenes of burned out buildings and buses, an ITN  spokesman said. "His passport and papers have been confiscated and he has been  ordered to stay in his hotel and 'await punishment,' " the spokesman added.  </P> <P> Last week in Shanghai, another reporter for ITN was expelled from China for  covering demonstrations in Shanghai while on a tourist visa.  </P> <P> In Beijing on Wednesday, soldiers detained Denis Hiault, Beijing bureau chief  of Agence-France Press, for an hour and confiscated his residence card. Hiault  was accused of photographing troops.  </P> <P> The Chinese media, meanwhile, reverted further Wednesday to the use of harsh  jargon reminiscent of Mao Tse-tung's chaotic 1966-1976 Cultural Revolution.  </P> <P> A front-page commentary in the official Communist Party newspaper, the People's  Daily, said that the recent disturbances show that "in our country, class  struggle still exists within certain limits -- a small number of reactionary  elements who hate the Communist Party and hate the socialist system have never  given up their political goals."  </P> <P> Another People's Daily commentary, also published on the front page, sharply  attacked Fang, his wife and the United States.  </P> <P> "Some people overseas who are hostile to China have tried hard to flatter such  people and label them 'democratic fighters,' " the commentary said. "Their aim  . . . is . . . to plunge China into chaos, to eliminate rule by the Communist  Party and to overthrow China's socialist system. . . . "  </P> <P> The commentary noted that "some people in the United States always hate  communism. They try hard to find ways to use their bourgeois ideology and  bourgeois political system to influence some Chinese people, with the goal of  establishing a bourgeois republic in China. . . .  </P> <P> "We hope that the American side . . . will stop its interference in China's  internal affairs."  </P> <P> Beijing's relations with other industrial democracies have also suffered sharp  deterioration as a result of the June 3-4 carnage.  </P> <P> Tension is building between China and Australia in the wake of press reports  that an unidentified Chinese dissident has been granted refuge in the  Australian Embassy in Beijing. An Australian Embassy spokesman declined to make  a substantive comment on the reports, but added: "Were the situation to arise,  we would handle it with the utmost sensitivity. Were such a case to arise, it  would be considered on its merits."  </P> <P> The recent violence and ideological rigidity in Beijing have also severely  damaged public confidence in the British colony of Hong Kong, scheduled to  revert to Chinese sovereignty in 1997.  </P> <P> David Wilson, the British-appointed governor of Hong Kong, dispatched two  personal representatives to London on Wednesday to try to persuade Prime  Minister Margaret Thatcher's administration to promise ethnic Chinese born in  Hong Kong -- who number about 3.25 million out of the colony's total population  of 5.5 million -- the right to move to Britain before 1997.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Visa Sections Reopen  </P> <P> The United States on Wednesday reopened the visa-issuing sections of its  Beijing embassy and its consulates in other parts of China, which had been  closed for several days.  </P> <P> A U.S. State Department spokesman announced Tuesday that it will begin granting  larger numbers of visas to Chinese citizens for temporary visits to the United  States.  </P> <P> In both Beijing and Shanghai, fairly typical crowds of about 200 people  gathered in the morning hoping to submit visa applications. Most were students  who had received acceptances from American universities and obtained Chinese  passports before the current crisis.  </P> <P> Applicants appeared unwilling to discuss politics.  </P> <P> "All I really care about is studying and getting exposure to the latest  technology," said Cai Baoxuan, 30, a pharmacist who wants to study at the  University of Hawaii. "I don't know anything about politics."  </P> <P> Times staff writers Karl Schoenberger, in Shanghai, and Norman Kempster, in  Washington, contributed to this article.  </P> <P> STUDENTS ON THE RUN -- Once-confident protesters are now fugitives.

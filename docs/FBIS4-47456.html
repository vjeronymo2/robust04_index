Laverov: ``It Is Time To Rid </F> Ourselves of the Illusions That Someone Wants To Help Us. We  Continue the Discussion on the Problems of Basic  Science''--first paragraph is RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA introduction]    [Text] First of all about competence. Do you remember the  incident with the Armenian Nuclear Power Plant? After the  earthquake in Armenia the question of what to do with the  nuclear power plant arose. The situation was an extremely  complicated one. Serious damages, casualties, but here a nuclear  power plant was operating near by. The governmental group, which  I was charged to head, should have made a decision on the fate  of the plant.    We came to the conclusion that it must not be shut down. In  the Politburo I and Ryzhkov for half an hour defended our point  of view. This is recorded in the minutes. But all the same it  was shut down ``at the request of the working people.'' Now they  are opening it again. If the leaders of that time had found in  themselves the courage and boldness to heed the opinion of  scientists and to follow our advice, Armenia, without a doubt,  would have been spared many troubles.    The conclusion is simple: Earlier, unfortunately, they also  did not always take into account the position of scientists. And  now the situation with this is, in my opinion, simply rotten.  And the present state of science is a clear example of this. It  is impossible to build a new, developed, democratic society  without scientific support. But what is happening in our  country? Remember what the ancients said: ``While listening to  the words, look at the deeds.''    We, it seems to me, should understand that we are already  living in a different society, but are still thinking in old  categories. Here we swear at the state and demand that it give  us money. But from where is it to get it? The debt of the state  comes already to tens of trillions of rubles. If we are to give,  hence, we are to take it from someone. But we see only our own  problems. This is understandable, but, it seems to me, precisely  scientists should now begin to actively suggest means of getting  out of the crisis. Who, if not we? For it is clear to everyone  that if they give money today, tomorrow the same problem will  arise. A fundamental settlement of the question is necessary,  and I am afraid that all our corporate claims--of the  intelligentsia, the workers, the peasantry, the service  sphere--in the attempt to survive are merely aggravating the  situation.    Because of the nature of my job I regularly visit the most  different enterprises. Recently I returned from the Arkhangelsk  Lumber and Paper Combine, the largest in Russia. It is  completely idle. Ukraine owes it 6 billion rubles. It is clear  that it will never pay it them. This is hundreds of workers and  their families. Other enterprises are also idle.    Now we should ourselves make, but without any political  cunning, a truthful diagnosis. Have they collapsed completely or  now yet? If they are in a complete coma, think about that to do  under the conditions of a coma. But everyone is afraid to speak  the truth. It turns out like it did with the Armenian nuclear  plant. But we will all the same have to make this diagnosis.    I have repeatedly talked about this to members of the  government. Whereas earlier there was no policy in the state in  the area of science and technology, now everything has been  aimed at the destruction of the sphere of science. The  allocations for science have been reduced according to my  estimates by a factor of 30. But if this is not the destruction  of science, what is it?    For me it is absolutely clear, and I think it also is for  all  of you, that under the conditions of such a gigantic deficit it  is time to specify national priorities. And to speak frankly  about this to everyone. We will develop agriculture and power  engineering, because without food and light it is impossible to  live, but we will close down science. May it not suffer. But  without science it is impossible to built a bright future. Here  I would also wish that there were no illusions.    I personally believe that it is necessary by and large to  talk not only about the Academy of Sciences. It is necessary to  talk about the entire sphere of science: sectorial, VUZ, and  defense. We all represent, after all, a unified complex. We are  saving basic science, but who will convert our knowledge into  specific technologies or pass it down to future generations? We  cannot saves ourselves on our own.    There is another thought. In 1966 we developed a unit for  superdeep drilling. It reached a depth of 13 kilometers. The  Germans with their machine building, which is famous throughout  the world, cannot develop such units. I am saying this, and  there are innumerable examples, because we have in domestic  science a large number of our own priorities, which are in the  leading positions. Just as the state as a whole needs to  determine its position with priorities, so each sector and  science, in particular, needs to go through all its archives, to  analyze the state of affairs and to say both honestly and  openly: We will develop and support this. And this we will put  off to better times.    I would like particularly to emphasize the attitude toward  us  of the world community. I have a serious report of foreign  analysts, which is devoted to the state of Russian science. The  conclusions there are interesting. The main thing is: Russia is  living beyond its means, it is incapable of supporting such  science, and the RAS should be reduced by two-thirds. Applied  science should be converted completely to financing at its own  expense. This report was prepared by experts of the European  Economic Community on the order of our Ministry of Science.    Roughly speaking, it is simply suggested to us that we lie  in  a coffin and in addition independently drive the nails into its  cover. They are suggesting that we do this, with our own money,  without blinking an eye.    The conclusion is one from my numerous contacts with foreign  structures. They did not help to help us and will not. They are  calmly watching us fight in the grip of our own problems, and  are giving advice on how we are to die subsequently. The  solution lies only in reliance on ourselves. It has turned out  historically that in our country science is monolithic and  unified. We are not bound to the West. Its own advantages and  disadvantages exist here. Thus, we are obliged today to use the  advantages. It is time to rid ourselves of the illusions that  someone wants to help us. For the present it is only in words.    I want particularly to emphasize the role of the  contemporary  press in the current fate of science. Earlier in every  self-respecting newspaper and journal there was without fail its  own department of science. For better or for worse they did  their job: They educated, popularized, raised the prestige of  scientific labor, and, when necessary, criticized. There was at  least some link of science and society. Without it neither the  state nor science itself can develop normally.    Now, as far as I know, all the departments have been  eliminated. Pseudoscience: fortune tellers, clairvoyants,  astrologers, and flying saucers, have replaced science. On the  threshold of the third millennium we are rapidly sliding into  the abyss of ignorance. But this is the road to nowhere.</p>

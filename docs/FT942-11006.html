			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / International Company News: Holderbank improves as sales climb Holderbank, a leading international cement and building materials group controlled by Mr Thomas Schmidheiny, said net income rose 10 per cent last year, to SFr287m (Dollars 205m), on sales up 7.6 per cent at SFr8.4bn. The group said the sales rise was due to a widening of the consolidation, plus higher volumes and prices. Deliveries of cement and clinker rose 7.2 per cent to 46.2m tonnes, and the volume of ready-mixed concrete was up 7.5 per cent, to 14.2m cubic metres. The directors have proposed a 20 per cent rise in dividends, to SFr15 on bearer shares and SFr3 on the registered shares.</p>

			<p><P> August 6, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SURFING AT HUNTINGTON BEACH;  </P> <P> THOMAS TRIPS ANOTHER FAVORITE;  </P> <P> HE MEETS THREE-TIME CHAMPION CURREN IN SEMIFINAL  </P> <P> Marty Thomas continued to glide over the Huntington Beach surf as well as the  top seeds Saturday at the Op Pro Surfing Championships.  </P> <P> Thomas, who is seeded 12th, pulled his second upset in a row with a 69 to 68.5  quarterfinal victory against fourth-seeded Martin Potter of England, the  current world-tour points leader. Thomas upset fifth-seeded Tom Carroll of  Australia in Friday's third round.  </P> <P> He will meet defending Op Pro champion Tom Curren in the semifinals at 8 a.m.  today. The finals are scheduled for 10:30 a.m.  </P> <P> Curren, who is from Santa Barbara but has lived in France for the past five  months, advanced with an 81.0 to 72.5 victory against Mike Parsons of Laguna  Beach. Richie Collins of Newport Beach and Sunny Garcia of Waianae, Hawaii,  will meet in the other semifinal.  </P> <P> The semifinal matchup with Curren, a two-time world champion aiming for his  fourth Op Pro title, will give Thomas a chance for revenge. Curren won their  only other meeting a few years ago.  </P> <P> "I'm going to have to surf really well," said Thomas, who is from Sunset Beach,  Hawaii. "He's the best surfer in the world in my opinion. I really have nothing  to lose.  </P> <P> "It would be a dream come true to take down Tom Curren at the Op Pro."  </P> <P> Thomas held off Potter in the closing seconds to earn one of the closest  victories so far at the championships. He led by only three-tenths of a point  when Potter caught a wave with 15 seconds left.  </P> <P> Judges add the scores of the top four waves to determine a surfer's overall  total.  </P> <P> Potter scored 13.8 out of a possible 30 points, but it wasn't enough to improve  his overall score. Thomas picked up a wave just before the final horn, scoring  a 10.5 and erasing an earlier score of 10.3 to increase his lead by two-tenths.  </P> <P> "I thought about holding him off the (first) wave because I had priority,"  Thomas said. "It was a tough move. If I would have taken the first wave and  slipped up, then he could have had the second one. Fortunately, we both caught  one."  </P> <P> Thomas said he had to keep his composure in the final minute. He knew the  competition was close because he listened to the scores over the public-address  system.  </P> <P> "I get that kind of composure from golf," said Thomas, who has an 18 handicap.  "If I fluff one shot, I can always make the next one. Surfing is all about  holding your composure. That was a strong force in my success last year on the  tour."  </P> <P> Thomas, 21, jumped from 44th on the tour in 1987 to 12th last year. A four-year  pro, he hopes he can get his first victory on the tour at the Op Pro.  </P> <P> "I was fifth at the Op last year," he said. "I've always done well at events in  California."  </P> <P> So has Garcia, who beat Rob Bain of Australia, 85.1 to 82.6, in the  quarterfinals. Bain's elimination marked only the fourth time an Australian  hasn't reached the semifinal of an Assn. of Surfing Professionals event.  </P> <P> "If I would have lost, everyone would have remembered me as the guy who was  bumped out by the Australian," Garcia said. "It was a make-or-break heat."  </P> <P> Collins defeated Ted Robinson of Manhattan Beach, 90.5 to 65, to make his first  semifinal appearance at the Op Pro. Collins said he has used the Op Pro to  experiment with new maneuvers.  </P> <P> "I've been doing all different kinds," he said. "I started copying Potter  because he's been winning. I've changed my style a lot in the last eight weeks.  I'm getting more comfortable with it."  </P> <P> Garcia said he and Collins have similar styles, which should make the semifinal  interesting.  </P> <P> "He's a lot like me," Garcia said. "We're both stubborn people. We have our  moments where we don't agree on things. If we both have our butts in gear it  should be a great (semifinal)."  </P> <P> Frieda Zamba, a four-time world champion, defeated Michelle Donoghoe of  Australia, 57.5 to 37, in the women's semifinals. Zamba, of Flagler Beach,  Fla., will meet Kim Mearig of Carpinteria in the finals at 9 a.m. today. Mearig  defeated Pam Burridge of Australia, 42.5 to 34.3, in the other semifinal.  </P> <P> "The most important thing for me was to get a wave where I could do more than  one maneuver," said Zamba, the 1986 Op Pro winner. "The waves had no form when  they did come in. I wasn't picky but I had to be pretty careful. Getting one  (wave) to the beach made the difference for me."  </P> <P> Saturday's results  </P> <P> Men  </P> <P> Marty Thomas (Hawaii) def. Martin Potter (England) 69-68.5.

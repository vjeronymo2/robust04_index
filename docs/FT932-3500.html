			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / Arts: Sanctuary kept at arm's length - Aldeburgh Festival The month of June increasingly looks like Benjamin Britten month. Riding on the coat-tails of the Aldeburgh Festival, the record companies tend to save up any Britten and this year promise to excel themselves: the first ever recording of Gloriana, brand new sets of Peter Grimes and A Midsummer Night's Dream, and a re-issue of Owen Wingrave are all on the point of reaching the shops. Since Britten's death the guardians of the Aldeburgh Festival have kept its focus on new music, looking forwards rather than looking back. Any danger of the festival turning into merely a sanctuary for Britten's music has been kept at arm's length, but when one of his works threatens to become an extinct species, there is every reason to revive it. The last-named of the operas above, Owen Wingrave, is rarely seen. On Friday it formed the opening night of this year's festival. Ideally, the opera would have been staged. (One fully staged production a year, besides any other considerations, would give audiences a stronger incentive to make the journey out to the East Anglia fens.) Owen Wingrave, though written specifically as a television opera, comes across surprisingly well in the theatre, as we know from the 1973 Royal Opera production. But, for whatever reason, it was only given a concert performance here.                           *      *      * Like the original television film (recently repeated by the BBC), this opera is in black-and-white. There is none of the ambivalence between good and evil so cleverly exploited by Britten in his best works, only a confrontation between what is right (the young, pacifist Owen) and wrong (his crusty, aristocratic, military family). Where the stage production gained was in the music's powerful evocation of atmosphere, the suffocatingly musty air of the Wingrave family seat. Britten was an experienced writer for the stage by this time and knew how to compose a mood right through an opera by basing all the music on a small number of recognisable intervals and harmonies. That was lost in this concert performance. So, more crucially, was a lot of the text. The London Sinfonietta, playing from the stage, was too dominant a presence; the resonant acoustic of the Maltings did the rest. I doubt that there was much the conductor, Oliver Knussen, could have done, but it was only in the later, less heavily-scored scenes that the opera began to exert a dramatic grip. In the title-role David Wilson-Johnson made Owen a less blameless spokesman for peace than usual by introducing a touch of irresponsibility and wilful rebellion. It was good to see John Shirley-Quirk as Coyle, the only survivor here from the original cast. Otherwise the singers made an impression according to how many of the words they could get across, John Graham-Hall as Lechmere and Mary King as Kate being the most successful. Even now there are Britten premieres that the festival is managing to dig out. After Owen Wingrave the audience could drive to Aldeburgh Parish Church for a late-night recital featuring the Haffner Wind Ensemble directed by Nicholas Daniel in two movements of a youthful Britten Wind Sextet - lively music, with a fine ear for sound and echoes of various other composers' styles. The enigmatic second movement did not make it clear whether Britten regarded the piece as finished. On Saturday the main event was a piano recital by Peter Serkin at the Maltings. This was a classic Aldeburgh event. The programme preceded Bach's Goldberg Variations with a sequence of short works which the pianist has commissioned from leading contemporary composers. A time-limit of six minutes seems to have been set, but some participants - like Knussen in his Variations, Op. 24 and Alexander Goehr with ' ..in real time 1' - subdivided their allotted time into even smaller units. Both pieces were inventive, vividly-characterised; the Goehr looked a beast to play.                           *      *      * In his Rain Tree Sketch and its successor, Rain Tree Sketch II, Toru Takemitsu preferred short mood-paintings, near-Impressionist in their sensitivity and delicacy, a surface of flickering activity over a deep underlying calm. Takemitsu is the festival's featured composer this year and the programme of his music includes three film events. The festival ends on 27 June with a repeat performance of Owen Wingrave.

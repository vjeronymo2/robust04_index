			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / International Company News: AT&amp;T hits impasse in Energis negotiations Negotiations between AT&amp;T, the US telecoms group, and Energis, the UK's third long-distance telecoms carrier, have reached a stalemate. The impasse puts AT&amp;T's ambitions to enter the UK market on hold. AT&amp;T, which has a UK licence application pending, was in talks to take a one-third stake in Energis, a subsidiary of the UK's National Grid Company, which is erecting a long-distance network across Britain using the NGC's electricity pylons. Energis offered AT&amp;T the chance of by-passing a long regulatory process to gain access to the UK. Energis looked to AT&amp;T for a powerful brand name and additional funding to complete its network. However, the talks appear to have foundered on the valuation of Energis. According to a consultant, Energis was holding out for a valuation AT&amp;T regarded as 'wholly unrealistic'. National Grid is owned jointly by the 12 privatised regional electricity companies in England and Wales. The chairman of one company said: 'There was a big price difference and we have separated, but are keeping in touch.' Energis argued that the low cost of its infrastructure compared to that of rival operators, British Telecommunications and Mercury, gave it a structural cost advantage. However, AT&amp;T took a more conservative view, believing the established UK operators had significant room to cut their existing cost base. The breakdown underlines AT&amp;T's problems in gaining access to the European telecoms market ahead of the EU's liberalisation of voice services in 1998. Its talks with France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom for a strategic alliance are also stalled, and the European Commission has yet to agree the terms under which new operators can enter the EU.</p>

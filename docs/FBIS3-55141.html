			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Reports by Yuriy Kovalenko in Paris and Yevgeniy Bovkun in </F> Bonn under general heading: "Neither France Nor Germany Wants  To Let Zhirinovskiy In"]    [Text] Paris -- Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's intention to visit  France in February and to meet with its state and party leaders  has thrown the latter into some confusion.    Some time ago Vladimir Volfovich came to Paris, where Eduard  Limonov, who was great friends with him at the time, organized  for Zhirinovskiy a warm meeting with Jean-Marie Le Pen, head of  the extreme right-wing National Front, and also a news  conference attended by two French journalists and four Russian  ones.    In the opinion of certain commentators, the French have no  formal grounds for refusing the LDP [Liberal Democratic Party]  chairman a visa.    Zhirinovskiy, who claims that the LDP is closer in its views  to the ruling Rally for the Republic party than to the National  Front, would like to meet with Jacques Chirac, chairman of the  Rally for the Republic and mayor of Paris. "I am against such a  meeting, which will lend legality to someone who openly espouses  fascist views," Pierre Lelouch, National Assembly deputy and  Chirac's foreign policy adviser, declared in this regard.    A number of French public organizations have already come  out  against Zhirinovskiy's visit. The official position was  expounded most clearly by Alain Lamassoure, minister for  European affairs. France, he said, cannot tolerate the  statements which the LDP chairman has made concerning Bulgaria,  the Romanian people, Finland, Turkey, and other countries. It  is perfectly clear, the minister emphasized, that unless he  changes his position, we will hardly be able to receive him in  France. Foreign Minister Alain Juppe is of the same opinion.    This warning from Paris, however, does not seem to have had  any effect. To all appearances, Vladimir Volfovich has  energetically begun making travel arrangements. One of the  stages in his preparations was an interview with a woman  presenter for France's TF-1 television station against a  backdrop of the Kremlin. (Incidentally, the Western press writes  that Zhirinovskiy is now demanding $300 for a five-minute  newspaper interview and many times more for a television one.  At least, he asked one U.S. station for 60,000 "greenbacks").    The LDP chairman intimidated people with the war which will  break out in Russia if events develop as before, and with wars  in general -- from India to Serbia. He announced that  Chernomyrdin will be replaced as premier in March -- no, not by  Zhirinovskiy but by a more neutral figure. He behaved  aggressively -- which can hardly have pleased the French.    Bonn -- After Zhirinovskiy promised to "remove" an official  of the FRG Consular Service in Sofia, declaring that he is still  backed by the KGB and its best secret agents in Bulgaria, even  those German mass media which reacted comparatively restrainedly  to the previous threats against Germany by the "lawyer's son"  (to arrange a second Chernobyl or send back the Russian troops  being withdrawn from Germany) took an interest in him.    Even if Zhirinovskiy receives a diplomatic passport as a  parliamentarian, a government spokesman emphasized, this will  not mean he has the right of free entry to Germany, and he will  in any case have to apply for a visa.    Along with seven people accompanying him, Zhirinovskiy was  intending to spend 18 days in Germany and indicated as the  purpose of the visit participation in a "European conference"  supposedly to be held in Berlin. But all attempts by official  establishments and journalists to find the organizers of this  conference were in vain.    Nor was it possible to establish which firm had invited him  to Berlin. The name which Zhirinovskiy himself indicated in the  appropriate column of the form could equally well have applied  to at least 20 very diverse enterprises.</p>

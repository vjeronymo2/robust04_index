			<p><P> February 24, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATIONAL GOP CHIEFS CUT ALL TIES WITH EX-KLANSMAN DUKE  </P> <P> The national Republican Party leadership, spurred by chairman Lee Atwater,  today cut all ties to former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke, the newly elected  Louisiana Republican state lawmaker.  </P> <P> Party spokeswoman Leslie Goodman said 28 voting members of the party's  executive committee unanimously repudiated during a telephone vote Duke's  racist and anti-Semitic views and barred financial or other assistance for him.  </P> <P> Duke, 38, a former klan grand wizard, was elected to the Legislature Saturday  from a suburban New Orleans district in a narrow victory over builder John  Treen, 63, who was backed by President Bush and former President Ronald Reagan.  </P> <P> The resolution adopted by the national Republicans in effect "excommunicates"  Duke, according to Atwater, who said Duke is neither a Republican nor a  Democrat but "a charlatan and a faker" using Republicans to promote his racist  agenda.  </P></p>

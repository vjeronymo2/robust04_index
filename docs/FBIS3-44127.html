The delegation will be holding their 1994 Regional ambassadors'  meeting in the country.    The Prime Minister said this signifies the strong bonds of  friendship that exists between the two countries and "the trust  and confidence the government and the Republic of China and  Taiwan place on us. The friendship of our two countries dates  back when Swaziland attained her independence in 1968 and ever  since, has grown from strength to strength."    He further extended regards to the Chinese Government for  the  contributions they made towards the preservation of the  country's heritage through the building of King Sobhuza II  Memorial Hall at Lobamba. "This is a greatest gift to the Swazi  Nation, for King Sobhuza II is held in the highest esteem by the  people of this country," he said.    Furthermore, the Premier thanked the Chinese government for  the assistance rendered to the people of Swaziland and economic  co-operation existing between the two-countries. "Your  Agricultural Mission continues to play an important role in  improving the farming standard of local farmers despite the  prolonged severe drought we continue to experience," he stated.    The two governments last week signed an agreement amounting  to E[Emalangeni] 3m[million] to boost agriculture. The money  will help farmers obtain loans from the Swaziland Savings and  Development Bank.    The Premier, on behalf of the nation, thanked the Chinese  government for their generosity during the time when in dire  need. The Chinese government contributed twice to the Disaster  Relief Force to help starving victims of the ravaging drought  and again when the nation was celebrating the Silver Jubilee.  They donated financially and materially. The Premier promised  that Swaziland would continue to support the government of the  Republic of China in the international forum in search for peace.</p>

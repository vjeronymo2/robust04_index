			<p>BFN     [By Neil Lewis]    [Text] Johannesburg April 26 SAPA -- Eds: this is a partial  transcript of an interview conducted on Tuesday [26 April]  afternoon between African National Congress President Nelson  Mandela and SAPA in the Presidential Suite of a Johannesburg  hotel. The ANC avers that it is the final press interview before  the election results are released:    SAPA: What are your emotions on the eve of casting a vote?    NM: "It is a very exciting moment because it is a  realisation  of our hopes and dreams. At last, our sacrifices are bearing  fruit. (But) what makes one go through a painful period is the  fact that some of those, who made this day possible, are not  there to enjoy the fruits of their labour. I am thinking of such  eminent persons as Oliver Tambo, Chris Hani, Dr Yusuf Dadoo,  Alex la Guma and others who have sacrificed tremendously to make  this day possible. I wish I could wake up all of them so that  together we could celebrate the victory of a struggle which  lasted for more than eight decades. My feelings are a mixture of  joy because this day has come, and sadness because some of our  heroes will not be here to celebrate. But naturally the dominant  feeling is that of joy, hope and confidence for the future."    SAPA: What are the major failures of the ANC's  electioneering  campaign?    NM: "I don't think in terms of failure...I think in terms of  success and hope. But one thing is that we have not been able to  get our people to realise the importance of getting identity  documents. But (our success has been that) we have rallied  unprecedented crowds. There is no organisation that has been  able to organise, rouse such massive support from all sections  of the population -- `coloureds', Indians and Africans and a  substantial number of whites in this country. Despite the fact  that there have been some weaknesses, the dominating factor is  one of a sterling campaign which puts us in a position to win  this election if we can resolve the issue of IDs and temporary  voter cards."    SAPA: But polling began this morning (Tuesday), how do you  hope to resolve the question of IDs?    NM: "I was discussing the matter of IDs with Judge (Johann)  Kriegler (head of the Independent Electoral Commission) about 30  minutes ago. They are devising plans to deal with this  situation. They think at least they will be able to provide IDs  and voter cards for another million people. I also discussed the  matter this morning with Mr de Klerk to request that the Home  Affairs Department should not work as they do now, where they  observe office hours. They must work 24-hours a day. He (Mr de  Klerk) has undertaken to see to it that this request is  accommodated."    SAPA: What percentage of the 22.7 million voters received by  the ANC would disappoint you?    Nm: "I'm not thinking in terms of disappointment, I'm  thinking in terms of hope and excitement. There are 22 million  voters in this country...3.5-million whites, 2-million  'coloureds', 600,000 Indians. That makes up a total of 6-million  and even assuming that de Klerk -- which I don't accept -- has  the support of the majority in these groups, I think the rest of  the population of South Africa is going to vote overwhelmingly  for the ANC. In that I include 'coloured', Indians and a  substantial section of the white community."    SAPA: But if the ANC received only 51 per cent of the vote?    NM: "As long as that is the result of a free and fair  election. We have to accept the results of a democratic process,  which we have established...I would accept that."    SAPA: Which individuals across the political spectrum would  you include in your cabinet of national unity?    NM: "I wouldn't do that. It is for each organisation to  decide who should be in a cabinet of national unity. It would be  presumptious of me to identify certain people and take on to  myself a task which should be addressed by the leaders of the  various organisations that will get five per cent or more of the  total vote cast in the election. I will be satisfied with what  (the organisations) give me."    SAPA: If an organisation received less than five per cent,  but you wanted an individual from that party in your cabinet?    NM: "Well, that is a matter we will have to discuss with the  Government of National Unity. Once we have a Government of  National Unity, whatever problems arise, they are the collective  responsibility of the entire cabinet of national unity."    SAPA: You recently spoke about the church having a  constitutional role in the country. What type of role for the  church do you envisage?    NM: "Already, we have established what was originally called  a council of state -- now it is the social and economic council  -- in which various organisations, traditional leaders,  religious leaders, women and student bodies and workers will be  represented. The church and religious groups are going to be  represented in that body. What I'm stressing is that the church  is a very powerful organisation, which has played an important  role in our struggle for democratic changes and it is necessary  for us to recognise that role. And the church is committed to  high moral values...the Involvement of the church in government  will help us to raise moral standards in government -- to a new  democratic government, one of whose purposes is to wipe away  corruption and to ensure that government is clean. These are  things in which religious organisations can play a key and  pivotal role."    SAPA: Will this mean religious leaders in cabinet?    NM: "Now that will depend on how my organisation and  colleagues welcome this idea. My own view is that we should not  put in government people who have not been democratically  elected. But I am concerned with the fact that they (church  leaders) should have a positive contribution proportionate to  the role they have played and the force they are able to wield.  I don't think we can deny them the role of having an impact in  government to ensure the maintenance of high moral standards."    SAPA: The whole of Africa is watching...your comment?    NM: "I am happy to join those countries of Africa that have  sucessfully fought for their independence. We are now part of  that great fraternity and it is in that spirit that we are going  to look at the problems of Africa."    SAPA: And Europe?    NM: "The people of Europe have a lot of goodwill for us and  they have long gone through the period that we are going through  now. Their experience is going to be very valuable to us. We  would like them to share that experience with us...also to  provide us with resources so that we are able to address the  problems in our country."    SAPA: And the us of America?    NM: "The United States of America is the leader of the  democratic world and it is very good that we should remain on  friendly relations with that country. They have a tradition of  democratic government. They can also help us in ensuring that a  democratic government in our country is entrenched."</p>

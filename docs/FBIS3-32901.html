			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Ruy Fabiano: "The Military and the PT"] </F>   [Text] Regarding the article that appeared here the day  before yesterday ("PT Seeks out Military"), an important Army  officer who occupies a post at the top of the hierarchy but whom  I prefer to keep incognito (let us therefore refer to him only  as "the source") has made some enlightening remarks to this  column.    The article mentioned the efforts of the PT--the party  favored by the polls to win the presidential election--to draw  closer to the military. And it said that the greatest resistance  to the party was to be found in the upper echelons, where there  was more ideological prejudice, whereas a fair amount of  receptiveness existed among the younger officers (captains,  majors, and so on). That is not the way things are, according to  the source.    When the Cold War ended, the Armed Forces began to cultivate  a new kind of behavior with regard to the ideological issue. It  is obvious that such a change does not take place overnight.  Complete assimilation takes time, and it is natural that within  the military, the values that were a part of their training for  decades should continue to exist for some time. Meaning, in this  case, anticommunist ideology.    But, the source says, the essential point is that for all  intents and purposes, the ideological issue among the military  is no longer an institutional issue or, much less, a national  security issue. It is an individual matter to be decided by the  soldier and his own conscience as a citizen. Everyone has his  own opinion regardless of his professional duties. The  point--and this is something that the source considers important  and in conflict with what we said in this column--is that  resistance to breaking down deep-rooted ideological prejudices  is in fact greater among the younger officers.    The older officers are the ones who have shown the greatest  flexibility and understanding regarding the need for political  coexistence with pluralism. And in any case, that split between  younger and more mature officers does not in fact lead to any  duality in thinking and/or behavior. Within the military, as is  natural in any institution governed by a rigid hierarchical  system, the feeling of unity and cohesion is what prevails.    The directive from above, and it is not being challenged at  any level, is simply this: the winner of the election in  October, be it the PT, the PCdoB [Communist Party of Brazil], or  any other party, will take power and govern normally. According  to the source, that bias toward legality dates back a long way  in the Armed Forces. The source says that even the Movement of  1964 was not exclusively military. He points out that "Jango"  was deposed by Congress, which supported all of the initial  actions (including the revocation of political rights) leading  up to the election--also by the congressmen--of Castello Branco.    According to the source, the break with the process did not  come about until 1968, and then it occurred in a radicalized  context of urban guerrilla warfare. But that is another story.  Let us get back to the PT. The party today is preparing to take  power, being confident that it will win the election. The source  says that the initial dialogue has been taking place through the  more mature officers. Lula's first contact with the officer  class occurred at the start of the redemocratization process,  when he spoke to students at the Army Command and Staff School.    The source recalls that his speech was arranged by generals,  but that the generals encountered resistance precisely among the  students (majors, lieutenants, and so on). Dialogue is  continuing today, and it is not by chance that the PT is  advocating changes in the constitutional area that are pleasing  to the military. And it is prepared to quadruple the Armed  Forces budget if it wins the election. It should be emphasized  that the military have been very reserved in that dialogue.</p>

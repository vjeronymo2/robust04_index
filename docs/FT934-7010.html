			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / Forte may sell KFC stake Forte, the hotels and restaurants group, is believed to be close to an agreement to sell its stake in Kentucky Fried Chicken to Pepsico, its partner in the business. Pepsico is expected to pay Forte about Pounds 40m for its 50 per cent stake in the venture, which is responsible for 304 Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants in the UK. Of these, 84 are directly owned by the Forte/Pepsico joint venture and 220 are franchised. Forte has been keen to sell its stake for some time as part of its drive to concentrate on its core hotel and restaurants business. Kentucky Fried Chicken has suffered from price competition from other fast food outlets. Forte does not provide separate figures for Kentucky Fried Chicken, but it said last September that the chain's sales fell in the six months to July 31 this year. This was in contrast to the restaurants division as a whole, where profits grew by 18 per cent to Pounds 40m on sales up 15 per cent to Pounds 358m. In addition to Kentucky Fried Chicken, Forte owns the Welcome Break, Happy Eater and Little Chef roadside restaurant chains. Last December, it bought the Relais autoroute restaurant chain in France from Accor, the French hotel group. Forte is believed to have had less luck finding a buyer for its Harvester restaurant chain which it put up for sale earlier this year. The group had indicated that it hoped to sell the chain for more than Pounds 120m. It is believed, however, that offers received so far have been for Pounds 110m or less. It is now thought to be holding out for a higher price. The Forte airport services division, which is to be floated early next year, will be called the Alpha Airports Group. Mr Paul Harrison, managing director of the division, said: 'The name Alpha was chosen because it signifies 'beginning' in Greek and is also appropriate, being the first letter of the aviators' alphabet.'</p>

			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / International Press Review: BBC feels chill from China It would be putting it mildly to describe the present relations between the Chinese government and the British Broadcasting Corporation as ill-starred. In the nearly half a century since the Communists came to power in 1949, the atmosphere between the world's premier broadcaster and Beijing has hardly been chillier - except perhaps during the bleak days of the Cultural Revolution of the 1960's and 1970's. But in that era most international media organisations were regarded with suspicion, if not downright hostility, as purveyors of capitalist propaganda. In this latest phase, however, the BBC finds itself the object of particular displeasure for transgressions, real or imagined, against China's interests. The fact that these tensions also coincide with the continuing row between Beijing and London over Hong Kong is not helping matters. In the latest incident, China expressed outrage over a television documentary which its makers said showed hitherto unrecorded footage of the Chinese gulag, or prison camps, in China's far-west. And, perhaps more irritating from the Chinese standpoint in the days leading up to President Clinton's decision on whether to continue China's privileged trade access to the US market, the BBC also reported that prison labour was being used to make goods for export. The US administration has laid down as one of its conditions for renewal of China's Most Favoured Nation trading status an end to the export to the US of items manufactured by prisoners. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, quoted by the official Xinhua newsagency, described the BBC reports as 'sheer fabrication' and suggested darkly that 'hostile people with sinister motives have gone out of their way to smear China with fabricated stories'. That rebuttal, which was not reported by local media was supported by an unusually detailed statement from the Justice Ministry indicating more than normal official sensitivity over the BBC report. Whatever additional fallout may result from this most recent skirmishing, it cannot improve an already fractious relationship which has resulted in China-based BBC reporters being subjected to restrictions on their freedom of movement and access to officials. Visas are also being denied to BBC programmers seeking entry to China. It is not the least of ironies that at a moment when China is proclaiming its opening to the world, BBC reporters are finding to the contrary that doors are being closed. The BBC's relations with China reached a nadir last December when Beijing reacted furiously - some might say over-reacted - to the BBC's screening of a documentary on the 100th anniversary of the birth of the late Chairman Mao Zedong entitled: Chairman Mao: The Last Emperor. Beijing unsuccessfully sought to have the film withheld and then protested to Britain for what it described as the 'BBC's vicious TV programme'. China was infuriated apparently by suggestions that Mao had until fairly late in life enjoyed the company of teenage concubines, and sometimes more than one at a time. The programme also depicted the late Chinese leader as something of a tyrant who had been the cause either directly or indirectly of the deaths of millions in the mass campaigns that accompanied his idiosyncratic rule. Chinese sensitivity over the BBC's output has been heightened by vast improvements in the broadcaster's signal to China and by the advent of satellite television. China, which exerted pressure on Mr Rupert Murdoch, the Australian newspaper publisher, to drop BBC news broadcasts from his Star satellite television network may have been emboldened in its criticism of the BBC by his decision to do so ( Mr Murdoch insists the BBC was banished to make way for Chinese language programmes more relevant to Star's target audience). But World Service Radio in both Chinese and English is widely received in China, especially since a new transmitter was installed in Hong Kong in 1987 and other transmitters are operating from near China's borders in the former Soviet Union. Chinese concerns and mis-perceptions about the BBC, wilful or otherwise, were exemplified by a commentary in the official Yangcheng Wanbao (Evening News) published last year in which the paper lambasted the broadcaster's intentions over plans to increase its transmissions to China. 'The BBC's main purpose in strengthening its broadcasting to China is to speed up its all-round invasion against socialist countries both spiritually and ideologically,' the commentator said, adding: 'When we listen to the free-of-charge information others provide, we should be able to tell the truth from falsehood, the beautiful from the ugly. And furthermore, we shouldn't let counterfeit and low-grade foreign goods burst into our world.' Such sentiments may be out of step with China's modernising image, but the fact that they are fairly widely held, including, it appears, among those responsible for foreign media, does not augur well for an early end to the Sino-BBC chill.</p>

			<p><P> October 13, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> UNITED NATIONS;  </P> <P> CENTRAL AMERICAN PEACE FORCE SOUGHT  </P> <P> U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar proposed sending 625 military  and civilian personnel to Central America in the first major U.N. peacekeeping  operation in the Western Hemisphere. However, State Department spokeswoman  Margaret Tutwiler hinted at U.S. concerns about the plans and refused to say  whether Washington would support it or exercise its Security Council veto to  squash the proposal. The effectiveness of such a contingent would mean there is  agreement among the five major powers, including the United States, to cut off  aid to the Nicaraguan Contras and the insurgents in El Salvador.  </P></p>

			<p>930524 FT  24 MAY 93 / Letter: Threat posed by cuts in ECGD staffing Sir, Your story 'ECGD review' (May 20) requires some comment in order to alert UK exporters to the likelihood that recent increases in the cover available from the Export Credits Guarantee Department may prove difficult to access if trade secretary Mr Michael Heseltine's review of staffing levels results in reductions in the already overstretched workforce. The business of ECGD has recently increased, in some areas by as much as 50 per cent, and this trend is expected to continue. Yet cuts in staffing were already proposed before the launching of this new review. The fact that the review may leave ECGD so understaffed that it will be unable to provide the promised service to exporters is not the only cause for concern. Following numerous previous reviews, morale among ECGD staff is extremely low, the result being that those with the most experience will take any opportunity to leave. The impression given by your article is that the review will only concern itself with 'overheads'. This is not the case. The number of staff who directly deal with exporters will also be reviewed. Morale is worst hit in ECGD's Cardiff offices, which are now threatened with closure. Instead of announcing a further review, it would be of more assistance if Mr Heseltine provided these staff with a guarantee that ECGD's operation will remain open there. In order to ensure that the government provides a level of export credit support to UK marketers which is comparable to that available to our overseas competitors, it is not enough just to announce increases in the amount of cover offered and reductions in premium rates. The government must also motivate the staff who provide the service. A J Sharpe, chair, trades union side, ECGD Whitley Council, 2 Exchange Tower, Harbour Exchange Square, London E14 9GS</p>

			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Income dispersion is the key, not income inequality Sir, The third of your excellent series on 'Can Europe Compete' (February 28) raises some interesting questions. You title one of your graphs '. . . wage inequality grows much faster in the US and UK . . .' This contains an implicit bias. No one is in favour of inequality, but your caption seems to imply equality of outcome to be the goal, rather than equality of opportunity. As a recent OECD report has noted (Employment Outlook, June 1993): 'There is a general increase in the proportion of the workforce with higher levels of education, and a relative increase in the earnings of highly educated workers.' The OECD goes on to note that, rather than imply any political favouritism, it uses the term 'income dispersion', rather than 'income inequality'. This view has also been supported by The Economist, which notes that further controls on wages (for nothing else will make incomes more 'equal') will have the same effect as the plethora of controls already in place, namely further unemployment. You correctly point to better education as the key. But the choice we face is a simple one: do we want people in low-paid jobs while they try to increase their level of skills so as to be able to earn higher wages? Or would we prefer them to be on a government training scheme, drawing the dole, while acquiring the skills necessary to be constructively employed in today's market place?

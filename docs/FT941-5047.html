			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Survey of Credit Management (3): Prompt payment is lifeblood  -Efforts to adopt careful procedures Arthur Shaw, the builders' hardware manufacturer, paid the penalty for failing to keep a tight rein on credit management. The Midlands company, like many others in the construction industry, was forced into losses by 'exceptionally high levels' of bad debt which transformed a Pounds 267,000 profit into a pre-tax deficit of almost Pounds 300,000 in the early 1990s. Claims of weak management control culminated in a boardroom coup by rebel shareholders, who brought in new executives and strengthened credit controls. The company has since returned to profit, and Mr Lindsay Melvin, finance director, claims its has made great strides in balancing debtors against creditors. The difficulties of such companies and an increasing number of corporate failures has prompted business organisations to draw up new guidelines on credit management policy. These organisations, led by the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) representing large groups and the Forum of Private Business acting for smaller companies, are united in condemning late payments. Dr Ian Peters, head of small business at the CBI, says: 'Late payments take the lifeblood out of companies - we have to change that.' But the two groups are divided on how best to tackle the problem. The Forum of Private Business wants the government to introduce legislation to outlaw late payments. Mr Stan Mendham, chief executive, says its 21,000 members want a statutory right to claim interest on overdue invoices. Such punitive additions to late payments, he claims, would offset the costs of extending credit to debtors. The CBI is opposed to legislation. Instead, it wants more companies to embrace its Prompt Payers Code, which seeks to ensure that payment terms are agreed at the outset of a deal and that they are not extended or altered. Although more than 500 of Britain's largest companies have signed the code - including giants such as British Airways, Marks and Spencer and ICI - Mr Mendham says it is not enough. Concerned that many small businesses are kept waiting by dominant suppliers, the forum has drawn up a 'profit builder' check sheet for members trying to reduce late payment costs. It urges businesses to track late payment trends and calculate the number of days during which it extended credit to late paying customers. Companies are also advised to consider building the cost of credit into their prices or, alternatively, offering discounts to customers able to pay on time. The check list also includes straightforward recommendations to ensure business survival. These include: Having one person responsible for debt collections; Establishing a credit worthiness procedure for new customers; Implementing a follow-up practice to chase overdue bills. Mr Mendham says such measures are vital. 'More than 80 per cent of our members say this is a critical issue. The problem is dominant customers holding up payments. Nobody dares challenge them - because if they do, they don't get the next order.' Meanwhile, the CBI has established a working party to draw up a new policy on credit management and respond to the Department of Trade and Industry's consultative document on the problems of commercial debt. The working party will expand the CBI's existing two-pronged strategy of encouraging good payment practice and awareness of credit management techniques. It is also expected to demand a British Standard for payment practice, but stop short of backing legislation. 'You can't have a law just to stop late payments,' says Dr Peters. 'It could be seen as interfering in commercial affairs.' He points out that the courts can penalise late payers with additional interest charges, and claims that any statutory rate would have to be fixed at a very high level to dissuade companies from regarding their suppliers as alternative sources of credit. Faced with differing recommendations and conflicting advice from business organisations, many companies have turned to credit management training services and factors - usually banks - which undertake to collect debts on the company's behalf and also make an advance to the company of a percentage of the money it is owed. Such help does not come cheap. For example, one day's training by specialists from Dun &amp; Bradstreet International, the business information group, can cost Pounds 1,200. For that, companies have their debt collection techniques minutely scrutinised and new programmes introduced. Ms Judith de Jong, manager of Dun &amp; Bradstreet's business education services, says a growing number of clients now want their salesforce trained in debt collection. 'We are training them to act as collectors as well as sellers. They need to understand the importance of late payments on the balance sheet.' That initiative has been taken up by Griffin Factors, the Midland Bank subsidiary. It has produced a guide to financial management which warns sales executives that 'a business with the finest product, an excellent sales record and the most efficient workforce will perish if it doesn't get paid'. It urges companies to build credit management policies around cash flow forecasts. Griffin identifies the 'debt turn' as one of the most important components of such forecasts. This figure - the number of debtor days outstanding - is calculated by dividing the value of outstanding invoices by total annual sales, and then multiplying by 365. 'It can provide early warning of any deterioration in customer payment performance and your cash flow,' says Griffin. The factor also warns suppliers to agree payment terms in advance and check customers credit with their bankers. They offer a guide to banking jargon - this ranges from good references to the awful, usually signalled by the phrase 'resources fully committed'. Guides to company credit worthiness come in all shapes and sizes. One of the most up-to-date services is offered by CCN Business Information, which lays claim to the UK's largest credit and financial information database. Mr Peter Brooker, director of CCN, say that unlike bank references, it can offer information on a particular executive's track record - a useful resource when there are few other details on a potential customer's probity. The Leeds-based group also offers on-line details about trading and credit activity of UK companies and a risk index, which calculates a credit score of businesses based on shareholder funds, liquidity and profitability. Such services are 'part of the armoury used by credit managers to minimise the risk to their companies', says Mr Brooker. All the business organisations, however, agree on the point of no return: if all else fails, go to court. Legal action, however, is usually expensive and, fully pursued, may only result in a winding up order against the customer and still no guarantee of payment. At the CBI, Dr Ian Peters admits: 'It's a long costly process and despite assurances from the Lord Chancellor's department, there is no evidence that it's getting better. 'The best way to avoid it is to plan ahead. That's the essence of good credit management.'</p>

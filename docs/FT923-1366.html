			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Norish moves ahead 11% to IPounds 1m Norish, the Co Monaghan-based food services group, reported pre-tax profits of IPounds 1m (Pounds 1m) for the six months to June 30 - a rise of some 11 per cent on the comparable IPounds 903,000. Despite the recession, the UK stores - which are now almost entirely consumer goods based - achieved high occupancy and good returns; the group was actively seeking to expand in the UK, directors said. Turnover fell to IPounds 4.87m against IPounds 7m last time, which included a contribution from the now-sold trading assets of the distribution business. The interim dividend is held at 4.47p, payable from earnings of 7.95p (7p) per share.</p>

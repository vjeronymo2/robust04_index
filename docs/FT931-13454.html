			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Letter: Welcome criticism of leases that cause pain and expense Sir, The Bank of England's criticism of the structure of English commercial leases is more than welcome, but indeed some decades too late ('Commercial lease provisions criticised by Bank', January 21). Upward only rent reviews, and the legal jargon in which lengthy leases are couched, have proved to be a blank cheque for both agents and solicitors for many years past, while rents are reviewed and argued and lease addenda are prepared, both nearly always at the expense and pain of the tenant. Surely the time has come for England to learn very quickly from its younger overseas cousins where commercial leases consist of a four-page preprinted form (blank spaces to be filled in) written in readily understandable plain layman's English. Commercial leases can be for any agreed period but usually three years, with renewals thereafter at agreed market rentals for whatever extension period is agreed between the landlord and tenant. UK developers, landlords, agents and solicitors have had it too good for too long milking the business community. The time is ripe for commercial property tenants to say 'enough is enough'] Peter Cormack, Cleary Court, Church Street East, Woking, Surrey</p>

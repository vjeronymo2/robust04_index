			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Carlo Pizzati: "Italian-U.S. Fisheries War"] </F>   [Excerpts] Enzo Maiorca is furious. For three weeks he has  been trying to get his colleagues in the National Alliance to  understand the importance and the seriousness for our economy of  a letter which he has received from the U.S. Embassy: Italy  risks a billion-dollar embargo if it does not give up fishing  swordfish with nets which are more than 2.5 kilometers long.  But no one apparently wants to listen to him.    Gregory Dunne, scientific attache at the U.S. Embassy in  Rome, in a letter sent on 27 May to the senator, who is already  the world skin diving record holder, was clear: If Agriculture  Minister Adriana Poli Bortone (National Alliance) does not  withdraw her intention to legalize the increase in the length of  the nets used for fishing swordfish from 2.5 kilometers to 9  kilometers, Italy risks a commercial embargo on all fishery  products in an amount of $1 billion or some 1,600 billion lire a  year. [passage omitted]    "The American Government," Dunne writes in his letter, "is  constrained by law to impose commercial sanctions on countries  which fail to respect international directives." Adding on a  more conciliatory note: "Both our countries wish to avoid such  commercial damage and a pointless diplomatic dispute." And in  any event the United States had already requested tighter  controls on swordfish fishing, even before Minister Poli  Bortone's intervention. What we have here is not interference in  domestic affairs, the diplomat seems to be wanting to say, but  sanctions which the United States are bound to apply under a  very precise law, approved two years ago, against those  countries which use methods which are damaging to the marine  ecosystem.

			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / Move on PSA sell-off expected THE SALE of the Property Services Agency's projects division, one of Britain's biggest construction organisations, is expected to be announced today by the government. Tarmac, the country's largest construction and building materials group, is favourite to take over the division, which designs and constructs buildings for government and other public-sector bodies. Many of the division's 2,000 employees are expected to be made redundant. Construction groups traditionally sub-contract most building work. The purchaser will also want to merge management teams and make other cost savings by rationalising the businesses. The need for any purchaser to fund redundancies and provide guarantees for work previously completed or undertaken means that the government is unlikely to raise any cash from the sale. There have even been suggestions that the government may have to make a cash payment to the purchaser. The division, which last year had a turnover of Pounds 190m, has wide experience of building offices, courts, prisons, laboratories and civil and military airports. Its experience of public-sector building requirements and strong links with government departments has meant that it has continued to win a large share of public-sector work even though most contracts are now subject to competitive tender. About 60 companies originally expressed interest in acquiring the division.</p>

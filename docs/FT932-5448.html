			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report This week's retreat in the precious metals market yesterday took the GOLD price to the lowest level since the middle of last month. After seeing the metal slip to Dollars 370.25 a troy ounce, adding Dollars 5 to Tuesday's Dollars 4.50 fall, some traders were suggesting that a test of support in the Dollars 366 area might be on the cards. 'It all depends on New York,' one dealer said. PLATINUM found the going even tougher and surrendered Dollars 14 to reach Dollars 382 an ounce at the afternoon fixing. Some analysts, seeing this as an overdue technical correction, prompted by the failure on Tuesday to push through resistance at Dollars 400 an ounce, expected the upward trend to be resumed soon. SILVER ended 19 cents lower at Dollars 4.41 an ounce, but some dealers saw that as a surprisingly robust performance. They had expected support at Dollars 4.35 to give way, allowing the price to slide to about Dollars 4.10 an ounce. At the London Metal Exchange sterling's weakness helped the COPPER market to rally and the cash position closed Pounds 19 higher at Pounds 1,166.50 a tonne. Higher-than-expected US housing start figures also encouraged buyers. Compiled from Reuters</p>

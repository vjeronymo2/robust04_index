			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Ankara -- Erdal Kabatepe, the chairman of the  Turkish-American Businessmen's Association said Wednesday [9  March] that he and his colleagues had launched a new movement  called the Liberal Movement.    At a press conference, Kabatepe, speaking on behalf of the  organizing committee, said that the Liberal Movement had been  created on the grounds that the existing parties and politicians  had failed to meet the people's expectations. He said that the  Liberal Movement would complete its organizing by June and would  establish a party to take part in the first general election  after that time. he said there was no liberal party in Turkey  and that no consensus existed between the Liberal Movement and  the current parties. He stressed that he and his friends had  launched the new movement in the belief that the ossified  structures of political parties did not allow them to put their  principles into practise.    Among the principles of the Liberal Movement are the removal  of the political ban on students and university lecturers  through an amendment in the Constitution, and holding a  referendum on the presidential system at the time of the next  presidential election. Stressing that the terrorism of the  outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) should be separated from  the Kurdish problem, the movement's principles urge active  struggle against terrorism and complete observance of human  rights.    Kabatepe said that the Kurdish issue could be solved through  "national consensus." Stressing that the terrorists should be  treated the way they deserved, Kabatepe said that it should not,  however, be forgotten that those who lived in Turkey's Southeast  Anatolia region were Turkish citizens.    "They also have the right to live in peace like everyone  else. Dialogue is a must. However dialogue is only meaningful  in an up- to-date democratic system in which every one is  represented," he said.    He went on to say that he and his colleagues did not think  that the removal of the legislative immunity of six Kurdish  based Democracy Party (DEP) deputies and two other independent  deputies was appropriate.    "Freedom of expression should be made a genuine right in  Turkey," he said. "There should be no need for lifting immunity  for freely expressed opinions. There should be no difference  between the members of parliament and the ordinary citizens."  Emphasizing that the main principle of the Liberal Movement was  to reduce state interference in the economy to a minimum,  Kabatepe said that the state should only assume a guiding role.    He said while the state should be very active in the fields  of security, defense, justice and social assistance, it should  play a lesser role in the fields of infrastructure, education,  health and social security. He also said that the and his  colleagues believed in the complete autonomy of the Central  Bank. Kabatepe claimed that Turkey was missing important  opportunities to become stronger in a world that would no longer  have super-powers but where a balance of powers would prevail.  In this situation, Turkey had a major part to play.    He declared that Turkey, which has not yet been accepted  into  the European Union, would not become a full member in the near  future. NATO had entrusted Turkey with the role of "guard" in  the Middle East, while it remained a mere spectator itself to  the real danger emerging in the north. Even, he said, it was  giving its support to Russia's expansionism.    He said Turkey should review its policy regarding the Turkic  republics and reinforce its commercial and economic cooperation  with those countries.    Emphasizing that the new balances in the Middle East should  be carefully assessed, Kabatepe said Turkey should both  reinforce its relations with Arab countries and improve its  commercial ties with Israel, while giving its support to  international initiatives for peace in the region.    Kabatepe said that no one should rely on Turkey becoming a  member of the EU, but that all efforts should be made to improve  living standards and democratic rights in the country. As far  as relations with the United States were concerned, priority  should be given to economic and commercial cooperation rather  than to military issues.</p>

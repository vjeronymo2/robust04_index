			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Unemployment will dominate G7 meeting THE PROBLEMS of rising unemployment in the industrialised world and the sharp economic downturn in Germany and other continental European countries are set to dominate today's informal meeting of Group of Seven finance ministers in London. According to officials who have prepared the meeting, the talks are expected to see some tough questioning of Germany's tight monetary policy, Japan's sharply rising trade surplus and the US attitude to trade and currencies in an attempt to iron out obstacles to world economic growth. Although Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor of the exchequer and G7 host, is satisfied that UK monetary and fiscal policies are contributing to global growth, a Canadian government official yesterday said that the UK would be warned against allowing its public sector borrowing requirement to continue rising sharply. 'He has got to act on the fiscal side,' the official said. But Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US treasury secretary, will be the centre of most attention when the ministers and central bank governors from the US, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada begin their discussions. The US wants its allies to give priority to growth, is anxious to revive G7 co-operation and wants a discussion of Russia's economic problems. It believes that it will have more leverage in the talks following President Bill Clinton's plan to cut the US budget deficit. 'I think the US will be in a substantially stronger position than it has been in many years because it is putting its house in order, it is responding to pressure from abroad, and its own economy is picking up,' a US treasury official said shortly before leaving Washington. For their part, America's allies want assurances that the Clinton administration is not protectionist and that it will support the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks. The impasse in the trade talks is regarded by some G7 officials as an important factor that has undermined the group's credibility as a forum for international co-operation. The Japanese government will be seeking an explanation of Mr Bentsen's recent comments in favour of a strong yen, which have been largely responsible for the yen's sharp rise against the dollar over the past week. Yesterday it signalled its mounting frustration with the US administration's failure to clarify the remarks. Speaking to the Japanese parliament, Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, warned that a rapid appreciation of the yen against the dollar could 'derange' the Japanese economy by hitting exporters. Mr Yoshiro Mori, the outspoken minister of trade and industry, warned that the yen's appreciation threatened to choke off what little growth was left in the flagging Japanese economy. Yesterday it appeared that the US would try to smooth over the row. Before leaving Washington one of Mr Bentsen's officials called his comment 'an off-hand remark'. He added that Mr Bentsen 'explicitly rejected a strategy of driving down the dollar'.</p>

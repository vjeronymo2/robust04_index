			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / Court review for Guinness case: Appeal to reconsider convictions after allegations of evidence being withheld The Home Office has asked the Court of Appeal to review the convictions of the four original Guinness trial defendants because of allegations that material evidence was withheld from the defence. The appeal will consider whether to quash the convictions against former Guinness chief executive Mr Ernest Saunders, the property tycoon Mr Gerald Ronson, the former stockbroker Mr Tony Parnes and Mr Jack Lyons, the financier. Mr Saunders, Mr Ronson and Mr Parnes were all jailed. Mr Lyons, a friend of former prime minister, Baroness Thatcher, was spared going to jail because of ill-health, but was stripped of his knighthood. The appeal, expected to be heard in the next six weeks, relates to a claim that the Serious Fraud Office withheld material evidence from the four defendants in the case, which ran from February to August in 1990. Mr Keith Oliver, a solicitor acting for Mr Parnes, said the alleged evidence showed that share support operations, of the kind practised in the Guinness case, were common City practice in the 1980s. It is alleged that this evidence was in the hands of the Serious Fraud Office, which prosecuted the case, before the trial began. This alleged evidence relates to at least six other cases of indemnified share support operations - where payments are made to individuals or institutions for buying shares - being used at about the same time as Guinness's Pounds 2.6bn takeover bid for Distillers in January 1986. Details of other such operations were given to the Department of Trade and Industry by directors of TWH/NV, a licensed share-dealing firm, during a separate investigation and then passed to the SFO. Part of the evidence was disclosed during a case held by a City of London tribunal in December 1988 on whether TWH/NV should be allowed to keep its licence to deal in securities, which TWH/NV won. But this evidence was not made available to the defence during the original Guinness trial. The Home Office said: 'Representations were made to the secretary of state that evidence had come to light of documents which were not disclosed either at trial or at appeal.' The SFO said it would strongly contest the appeal: 'What has come to light is not new evidence. It is unused material which was not regarded as relevant at the time (of the trial of the original defendants).' The future of the SFO, set up in the late 1980s to handle cases of complex financial crime, is currently under review by the government because a number of its high-profile prosecutions have collapsed in embarrassing circumstances. The Guinness convictions were always held up by the SFO as an example of its success. A former government official, Mr Rex Davie, is completing a report for the attorney-general, Sir Nicholas Lyell, on whether the SFO should lose its independence and be put under the aegis of the Crown Prosecution Service. If the appeal is successful, the four businessmen men convicted in the case are likely to ask for compensation running to millions of pounds. A friend of Mr Lyons said he would ask for the return of his knighthood.</p>

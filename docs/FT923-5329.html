			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Moslem victims locked up in cattle sheds: Lara Marlowe visits two Serb prison camps in Bosnia with a CSCE delegation OVER the next few days, a delegation from the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, will report back after an inquiry into human rights in Bosnia-Hercegovina. Led by Sir John Thomson, a former British ambassador to the United Nations, it visited prison camps set up by the Serbs in Bosnia. The Serbian authorities claim the camps at Manjaca and Trnopolje, both visited by Sir John's delegation, are the only ones left in north-western Bosnia. However, relief officials suspect thousands of Moslem women and children - the families of the men imprisoned in the other two camps - may be held at Duboj, north of the republic. Most are victims of the 'ethnic cleansing' of the Kozarac community near Prijedor, where 22,000 people have been expelled from their homes. Serbian officials want to exchange prisoners for Serbs held by Moslems. They expressed anger at the international outcry over the camps and told the CSCE delegation that 6,000 Serbs allegedly held in Croatian and Moslem-run camps had been ignored. At Manjaca, high in the mountains near Banja Luka, 3,640 male prisoners are housed in the cattle sheds a former dairy farm surrounded by barbed wire, Alsatian guard dogs, watch-towers and minefields. Lt Col Bozidar Popovic, the camp commander, claimed to Sir John that all the inmates were military POWs. But humanitarian aid officials who have interviewed them concluded that all but four of the internees - including 390 men under the age of 16 or over the age of 60 - are civilian victims of 'ethnic cleansing'. Although some have gained 20 kilos since food improved with visits to the camp, many still appear emaciated. Col Popovic, who shouts at all times and frequently cites the Geneva Convention, is apparently trying to blackmail the Bosnian government, led by President Alija Izetbegovic, and relief officials by refusing to make preparations for winter, saying that he hopes 'humanism will prevail on the other side'. The transfer of Manjaca's Moslem prisoners to the Moslem-held area of Bosnia might alleviate the men's suffering and in some cases allow them to be reunited with their families. But it would also aid the Serbs in achieving their goal of an 'ethnically pure' Serbian Bosnia. The 2,000 inhabitants of the Trnopolje 'open reception centre' in north-western Bosnia, live just a few km from their former homes in Kozarac and can see the minaret of their mosque from the carpark where they sit shirtless in the hot sun under makeshift tents. The prisoners say that more than 5,000 Moslems from Kozarac were killed by Serbian militiamen when the town was 'cleansed' late in May. As Sir John discovered, some are allowed to walk to their plundered and dynamited houses to pick fruit from their gardens. Serbian refugees have moved into the few homes that were left standing. In theory, the Moslems are free to leave, but they have no homes to return to - in most cases, they have been completely destroyed - and Serbian gunmen near the camp fire shots at night to intimidate prisoners. Mr Milomir Stakic, the mayor of Prijedor, told the CSCE delegation that the Serbs were fighting 'Moslem extremists' in Kozarac, and that Moslem survivors of the fighting there continue to attack Serbian forces from the nearby Kozara Mountains - once a Serbian stronghold against the Germans. But the Moslems, indistinguishable from their fellow south Slavs, are secular. Even in the few Mosques still standing, there is not the slightest hint of fundamentalism, either in dress or ritual. In regions which have not yet been completely ethnically cleansed, Moslem households are required to fly a white flag to show they have no weapons in their house, and 'as a sign of our loyalty', says the local Imam in the village of Cela, about 15km from Trnopolje. The white flag on the Cela mosque did not stop drunken Serbian soldiers from setting fire to it in August, killing an old Moslem man and throwing his body into a well. Fifteen men were arrested and held for several days for 'interrogation'. One never returned. Another has been sent to the Manjaca prison camp. The Imam has stopped making prayer calls from the minaret, and villagers have promised not to hold any meetings. A Serbian policeman stands outside the mosque each Friday, presumably to monitor sermons. Villagers are afraid to travel into Prijedor. 'We have made a deal with the local Serb authorities. We will not oppose them, and they will not harm us and they will protect us,' the Imam told Sir John and his fellow delegates who are to draft a report on their visit when they return to London at the weekend. 'Until now they have kept their word. But we don't know about the future.' Back in neighbouring Croatia, western diplomats have little hope in the implementation of the London Conference. Few believe that even if Bosnia's Serbs give back a tiny percentage of the territory they have seized, they will allow the Moslems to return.</p>

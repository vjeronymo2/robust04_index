			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pretoria Feb 17 SAPA--At face value the government  and African National Congress' [ANC] latest constitutional  proposals seemed good, but it could be a smoke screen to gain  the moral high ground and reinforce the Afrikaner Volksfront's  [National Front -- AVF] image as "spoilers", AVF sources said on  Thursday [17 February].    Approached for comment the sources however stressed that the  proposals were still being studied and that comment was  premature. The package seemed to be a reformulation of the  initial proposals which had led to the deadlock in trilateral  talks, they said. "We cannot understand why it is so difficult  to insert a clause that there `shall' be a volkstaat [homeland].  It would be difficult to sell a vague concept or a promise to  our constituents in this volatile political climate." This  created the impression that the government and the ANC were not  totally serious, they said.</p>

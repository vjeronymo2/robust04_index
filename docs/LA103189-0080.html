			<p><P> October 31, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 400 PROTEST SUSPENSION OF DEAN OF STUDENTS  </P> <P> About 400 students at Dominguez High School in Compton staged a four-hour  walkout Monday that was so peaceful the principal lent them his sound system  and, at his request, the protesters picked up their trash before returning to  class.  </P> <P> The crowd of mostly juniors and seniors at the 1,800-student school was  protesting the suspension last week of the dean of students, Cornelia Davis.  The reason for the suspension was unclear.  </P> <P> School district officials said Davis has been suspended without pay pending an  investigation by the school board. They declined to comment further, saying it  was a personnel matter.  </P> <P> The students assembled on the front lawn of the school at 9:30 a.m. and  returned to classes at 1:30 p.m., shortly after student leaders met with  Principal Ernie Roy.  </P> <P> Davis could not be reached for comment. She was described by several protesting  students as a mother figure at the school. "She's like a motivator to all of  us," said senior Kimberly Wilson, Dominguez's liaison to the Compton Unified  School District Board of Trustees.  </P></p>

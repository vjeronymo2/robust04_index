			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> TOUR LEVIES HEAVY FINES ON EDBERG, LENDL, AGASSI FOR FAILURE TO PLAY  </P> <P> Stefan Edberg, Ivan Lendl and Andre Agassi were fined substantial amounts by  the ATP Tour today for failing to play in the required number of tournaments  this year.  </P> <P> Edberg, the world's top-ranked player, was fined a minimum of $115,496.  </P> <P> Lendl, ranked third, was fined a minimum $95,443 and the fifth-ranked Agassi  was fined a minimum of $85,042.  </P> <P> Greg Sharko, an ATP Tour spokesman, said the amount of the fines would increase  proportionally to include any income the players earn during the rest of the  year.  </P> <P> "This is more than a financial penalty. I see this as an expression of  commitment to play the ATP Tour World Championship," ATP Tour Chief Executive  Officer Mark Miles said in a statement.  </P> <P> Edberg and Agassi were required to play in 11 tournaments. Lendl, because he is  a 10-year veteran, was required to play one less.  </P> <P> All three are now two tournaments short and the Paris tournament next week, in  which they all are scheduled to play, is the final event before the  season-ending ATP Tour World Championship at Frankfurt, Germany, from Nov. 13  to 18.  </P> <P> Sharko said the ATP Tour rules require a player be fined 10% of his income for  each tournament he misses. Income from Grand Slam events are not included in  the fines.  </P></p>

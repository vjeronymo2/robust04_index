			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / Arts: Elusive 'Mrs Dalloway' - Cleveland Lyric Opera Creating an opera out of Virginia Woolf's novel Mrs Dalloway is a bit like trapping a cloud in order to make ice cubes: the material is there, for sure, but the process changes it out of all recognition. And there are easier sources of water. Nevertheless, Bonnie Grice, a radio journalist, insisted that the thing could be done, and managed to persuade first Michael McConnell, the director of Cleveland Lyric Opera, then Libby Larsen, the destined composer. A few years later, with a libretto duly supplied by Ms Grice, the piece provided this small, game company with its first full-length world premiere. Of course it was impossible. Plot in Mrs Dalloway is less important than character, and character considerably less important than method. What matters in the book is the sense of the simultaneity of unrelated things - simultaneity of thoughts, events, purposes and flash moments, to all of which the narrative is mysteriously privy as it froths and bubbles on, a superior gossip. One can imagine a Mrs Dalloway symphony - the book itself seems to mimic symphonic form with its recurrent themes, distinct movements and passages of development - but not a Mrs Dalloway opera. No wonder a composer friend told Ms Larsen to steer clear. Instead she went on and did a workmanlike job. By the evidence of her output  -which includes four other operas, as well as buckets of symphonies, chamber music and choral items, all from the last two decades - she is a workmanlike composer. Ms Grice's libretto provided a sentimental reunion (that of Clarissa Dalloway and Peter Walsh), a sentimental memory (of Sally Seton) and a sentimental melodrama (the suicide of Septimus Warren Smith, while his wife is arguing with his doctor). All of these Ms Larsen dutifully set, without any particular show of enthusiasm, for soloists accompanied by a small band with prominent percussion and electronic keyboards. The right buttons were pressed: expressionism and eeriness for Septimus, waltzes for love remembered and regretted, neoclassicism for civilisation, contortions of 'God Save the Queen' for England. There was nothing wrong with any of it, and nothing right. The presence of so many reflective solos suggested that Ms Grice's conviction about the idea sprang from the misconception that a book of memory would lend itself to being told through aria. It failed to work because the pace of operatic reflection is so much slower than that of Woolf's prose, and because, without the narrative voice to rush and connect and poeticise, what these people have to say is trivial. Even the counterpointing of the two main threads - Clarissa's life of poignant recollection and Septimus's imprisonment in memories of the Great War - was trivialised by being overstated, and by being baldly cut free from the wash of other characters and incidents the book needs for its tone and its technique. The title character became a rather frail and neurotic creature, perhaps for reasons that had to do less with Mary Elizabeth Poore's performance than with the transmutation. If you have to sing to yourself about how wonderful life is, then things must be pretty bad. If you have only Ms Larsen's music with which to do it, you might as well take Septimus's escape route. In the opera, though, Septimus was a force, as musical madmen tend to be, and Gary Briggle was striking in the part: a strong lyric tenor with the rough grate of frayed emotions in his voice. Mr McConnell's first reaction to Ms Grice's importuning was to counter that the book was a film, not an opera. However, Steven Perry's set - an interior with great curves and azure paint suggesting Paris rather than Westminster - offered little opportunity for the dissolves and cross-cuttings that the words and music were trying to realise.</p>

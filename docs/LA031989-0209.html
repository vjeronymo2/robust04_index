			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFING: EVENTS IN THE NEWS THIS WEEK.  </P> <P> The Huntington Beach City Council will hold a public hearing Tuesday on whether  to change zoning from commercial to conservation on degraded wetlands  stretching along Pacific Coast Highway between Beach Boulevard and the Santa  Ana River. The area has been designated for conservation in the city's general  plan, but specific zoning of the property stalled in the Planning Commission  after threats of legal action by two private landowners.  </P> <P> One parcel between Brookhurst Street and the Santa Ana River, known as the  Talbert Marsh, is already undergoing restoration under the auspices of the  private Huntington Beach Wetlands Conservancy. Last month, tidal flow was  restored to the 24-acre parcel.  </P></p>

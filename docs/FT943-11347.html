			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Dollar strength gives support to the continent The US played a major factor in lifting sentiment across the continent yesterday. FRANKFURT closed the official session with a 1 per cent gain in the Dax index, but was barely changed on the week. The index ended up 23.83 at 2,146.64. In the after market the Ibis moved ahead to 2,152.19. There have been additions to those brokers turning positive on the German market. Mr Eckhard Frahm of Merck Finck is hopeful of a summer rally, noting that the market made a 6 per cent gain during July, while Mr Julian Callow at Kleinwort Benson looks at a discount rate of 4 per cent by the end of the year, helped by favourable inflation and monetary data. Sector rises were seen in those areas which have been strong over the past week, including Deutsche Bank, up DM3 at DM731.50, which led the way with results on Tuesday. Lehman Brothers, although confident about the bank, thought that there was greater upside to be seen elsewhere, particularly in Dresdner which 'commands a price to cash flow multiple of 3.9, compared with 4.8 at Deutsche'. Consequently, Lehman maintained its neutral, low risk rating. The vehicle sector improved further: Daimler up DM18.50 at DM*02.50, BMW up DM4 at DM867.00 and Volkswagen DM5 firmer at DM502. James Capel recommended a switch out of Daimler into BMW, but maintained its strong position on VW. MILAN found some reassurance in the day's political developments and shares recouped part of the sharp losses seen earlier in the week. The announcement that Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister, planned to separate his political and business roles, together with news that his brother had turned himself in to magistrates both helped to calm the nervous market. The Comit index rose 13.97 or 2 per cent to 709.76, but was still 2.9 per cent lower on the week, reflecting the sharp falls on Tuesday and Wednesday. Industrial stocks lead a broad-based upswing, with Fiat adding L150 to L6,940 and Pirelli adding L80 to L2,885. Mr Nicholas Potter at Credito Italiano International commented that Fiat was benefiting from its positive performance in its home market and joint ventures abroad while there appeared to be a fundamental review taking place of Pirelli's prospects, which included its commanding position in the fast growing Brazilian market. 'The strong performance of corporate Italy is a welcome diversion from the market turbulence seen this week, which clearly came about through broader issues regarding the control of public finances,' he said. PARIS was a late closing beneficiary of the US currency. The CAC-40 index increased 21.56 or 1 per cent to 2,074.99, up 1 per cent on the day and 1.6 per cent on the week. Roussel Uclaf was a strong performer, the shares up FFr32 to FFr603 following results which came out after the close on Thursday. Commenting on the data Goldman Sachs said that the first half figures were better than expected and highlighted the positive fundamentals which supported that company - strong underlying pharmaceutical growth, significant restructuring benefits, potential synergies with Hoechst, the parent company, strong financials and considerable overall scope for margin expansion. Eurotunnel rose FFr1.35 to FFr26.95, with some unconfirmed reports suggesting that a limited and restricted allocation passenger service might start later in the summer. ZURICH was helped ahead by the firm dollar and prices received a further boost during the afternoon from the positive reaction of US markets to the the day's GDP figures. The SMI index rose 20.2 to 2,579.5, but was 0.7 per cent lower on the week. Investors continued to display a cautious approach to the banks, ahead of half year details from Credit Suisse which came after the market had closed. CS Holding bearers, however, still added SFr6 to SFr571 while UBS, reporting half year figures next week, also rose SFr6 to SFr1,181. Roche certificates picked up SFr30 of recent losses to SFr5,320. Cyclicals put in a strong performance with Brown Boveri adding SFr16 to SFr1,229, Sulzer putting on SFr11 to SFr965 and Alusuisse rising SFr17 to SFr702. Ares-Serono bearers put on another SFr30 to SFr730 after Thursday's 16.5 per cent surge which followed news from Biogen, the US group, of positive prospects for its beta interferon treatment for multiple sclerosis. Ares is developing its own beta interferon treatment and also has the patent for the production process. AMSTERDAM made forward progress helped by late strength in the dollar, leading the AEX index up 2.99 to 408.21 on the day and 1.2 per cent on the week. There were further gains among the cyclicals with DSM and Akzo Nobel again featuring among the most heavily traded issues. Both groups are expected to announce generally encouraging results next week, helped by an improvement in the chemical sector overall. DSM put on Fl 1.40 to Fl 142.90 and Akzo made Fl 1.90 to Fl 214.40. A solid rise was seen in Hoogovens, the metals company, again on the likelihood that earnings will be boosted by prospects for economic recovery. The shares closed at a new year's high of Fl 79.50, up Fl 2.30. STOCKHOLM was lifted by declining interest rates and confidence on the outlook for corporate earnings. The Affarsvarlden General index rose 1.1 per cent to 1,464.2, little changed on the week. Volvo was a favourite among investors, up SKr15 to SKr760. MADRID posted a 1.3 per cent rise with the lower than expected US GDP data bringing a rush of demand during the afternoon. The general index rose 4.16 to 313.70 in solid turnover of Pta29.7bn. Electrical stocks were the strongest sector with Endesa rising 3 per cent to Pta6,130.

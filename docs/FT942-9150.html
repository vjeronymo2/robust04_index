			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / International Company News: Mead plans to divest on-line services unit Mead, the US paper, wood products and packaging group, plans to divest Mead Data Central, the electronic information division best known for its Lexis/Nexis on-line services, Reuter reports from Dayton, Ohio. According to analysts, Mead should get about Dollars 1bn for the division and will probably sell it to a communications group with which it has an alliance. The Mead Data unit was acquired for Dollars 6m in 1968. It said it is the world's largest provider of on-line information services for legal, news and financial information and a leading force in the electronic publishing market. The legal publishing market is worth Dollars 3bn and Mead Data had revenues of Dollars 551m in 1993. The on-line services, legal print and CD-ROM products, electronic publishing software, and productivity software are widely used.</p>

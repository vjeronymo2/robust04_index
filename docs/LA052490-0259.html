BRIEFING;  </P> <P> LLOYD'S LOOKS TO SOVIET MARKET  </P> <P> The Soviet Union presents huge opportunities for foreign insurers if it  succeeds in reforming its economy, the chairman of the Lloyd's of London  insurance market said today.  </P> <P> "We have to be optimistic and take the view that they're going to become part  of the modern world in which case there has to be a colossal opportunity,"  Murray Lawrence told a wire service.  </P> <P> Lawrence is heading a Lloyd's team in Moscow for talks with Soviet state  insurance companies to see what role the world's largest insurance market could  play in the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> Lloyd's was already considering approaches from Soviet international insurer  Ingosstrakh to help cover commercial space satellite launches, 10 of which are  planned for 1992.  </P></p>

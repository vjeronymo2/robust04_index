			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Bush responds to Japanese work ethic jibe PRESIDENT George Bush yesterday defended the US work ethic against disparaging Japanese comments and his economic recovery package against domestic congressional criticisms, saying that growth and determination would help propel the world into 'the next American century.' He avoided a direct attack on Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, who earlier in the day apologised for the 'misunderstanding' he had caused by a parliamentary answer on Monday. Mr Miyazawa had told a Diet committee that he had felt for a long time that Americans 'may have lacked the work ethic'. The remarks had been condemned by the White House in Washington as 'not helpful'. Mr Bush, addressing a convention of 5,000 food store executives in Orlando, Florida, said: 'We'll combine our common sense, our work ethic and our determination with pro-growth policies,' adding: 'Day-by-day and step-by-step we're going to get ourselves moving' out of the recession. Rejecting criticisms from Democrats and Mr Jack Kemp, his housing secretary, that the plan outlined last week in his State of the Union message and national budget was filled with 'gimmicks', the president said: 'I'm going to just keep challenging the Congress to get this economy on the move. We've got a good sound, stimulative package. And this is no time for political carping.' The exchanges between Tokyo and Washington highlighted the increase in bilateral tension since Mr Bush visited Japan last month. Mr Richard Gephardt, House majority leader, called Mr Miyazawa's remarks an 'ignorant expression of Japanese racism'. He added: 'The Japanese prime minister is wrong. Americans work hard every day, and our productivity is higher than Japan's' Yesterday Mr Miyazawa said he had intended to criticise an over-emphasis on speculative financial activities in Japan as well as in the US, and not to criticise Americans. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs added that the phrase 'work ethic' meant 'philosophy of work'. The elaborate explanations offered indicate how sensitive Japanese officials are about antagonising the US.</p>

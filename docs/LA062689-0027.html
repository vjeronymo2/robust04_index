			<p><P> June 26, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: NUTS MAY AVERT HEART DISEASE  </P> <P> A handful of nuts a day may keep heart attack away, according to a group of  researchers at Loma Linda University. A six-year study of diet and fatal  coronary heart disease among 34,000 California members of the Seventh-day  Adventist Church found that nuts were the only food item listed with a  statistically significant protection against heart-attack death.  </P> <P> "Compared to a person who never ate nuts, a person who ate them at least once a  day had only 47% of the risk" of fatal heart attack, said Dr. Gary E. Fraser,  co-author of a study presented last week at the Second International Conference  of Preventive Cardiology in Washington.  </P> <P> Fraser said the data was collected through questionnaires mailed between 1976  and 1982. In a follow-up study, the researchers found that there had been 260  fatal heart attacks among those surveyed earlier. The scientists then compared  answers on the dietary questionnaires to determine what foods, if any, tended  to suggest protection against heart disease.  </P> <P> Fraser said nuts appeared to be the major common food that protected against  heart disease. Peanuts were the most commonly consumed nut -- chosen by about  60% of those questioned.  </P> <P> Fraser said it is not now known what in nuts can provide protection from heart  attack, but he speculated that it could be the types of polyunsaturated  vegetable fats.  </P></p>

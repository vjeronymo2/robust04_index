			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / Observer: They toil not So, fresh from a relaxing sojourn at his Normandy holiday home, Peter Lilley has agreed to reappear in support of Britain's Tory government in its European election campaign. It seems the secretary of state for social security will now show up in Bradford, bolstering the hopeless cause of the Conservative candidate in that town's by-election. A hastily arranged programme - to persuade us his absence in no way reflected his disdain for the European Union - will also see Lilley visiting a factory in Leeds, as well as on walkabout in Huddersfield. Tory central office is deeply embarrassed at Euro-sceptic Lilley's preference for a relaxing holiday over supporting the prime minister on the stump. Not everyone shares that chagrin. 'We are better off without him,' says one of Major's unhappy band of pro-European ministers.</p>

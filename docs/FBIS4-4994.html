			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From MAINICHI SHIMBUN 5 April Evening Edition] </F>   [Text] At a news conference held after the cabinet meeting  on 5 April, Director General of the Defense Agency Kazuo Aichi  stated: "Each cabinet has a role to play. The Tanaka cabinet  dealt with the restoration of diplomatic relations between Japan  and China, and the Takeshita cabinet with consumption taxes.  The Hosokawa cabinet has accomplished its mission of political  reform. It will naturally have to change its character and set  its next goal. Depending on what the goal will be, the question  of whether the present framework is good enough may arise." He  indicated that in order to facilitate the implementation of tax  reform, which is expected to follow the passage of the fiscal  1994 budget, there may be changes in the composition of the  coalition.    Among the ruling coalition parties, Komeito Secretary  General  Yuichi Ichikawa has proposed a "council on basic issues" for the  ruling parties to discuss policies, while the Social Democratic  Party of Japan and Sakigake [Harbinger] are suspicious of this  proposal. Under the circumstances, Aichi's remark is expected  to create a stir.</p>

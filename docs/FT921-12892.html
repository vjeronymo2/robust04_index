			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Letter: A hazardous view of women Sir, What was the reason for using the triangular road sign denoting a warning, signposted with 'Women at work', to accompany the article, 'Priestess of the black art' (January 22)? The potential implication that the Financial Times endorses the view that women are a hazard in the work place is of great concern to me. Lynn Soper, Garden Flat, 29 Pembroke Road, London W8 6DP</p>

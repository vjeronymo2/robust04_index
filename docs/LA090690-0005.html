			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONTROVERSY OVER HAYDEN AND 'BIG GREEN'  </P> <P> I am one voter who will try to keep my prejudices from coloring my vote on  Proposition 128.  </P> <P> What remains of our environment is too precious to allow my personal bias to  bleach Big Green into Grungy Gray.  </P> <P> Besides, I am always suspicious of writers of anonymous letters or of anonymous  radio advertisements. Are the writers of the advertisements too ashamed to  acknowledge authorship and to obey the law which requires identification of the  sponsors of political ads?  </P> <P> MARGARET LORENZ ROMANI  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

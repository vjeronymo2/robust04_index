			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / Jazz Services tours for 1992 Jazz Services tours for the 1991/92 autumn and spring seasons feature major artists from all areas of the British jazz scene. For its programme Jazz Services is touring five bands and began last November with the Frank Williams African Jazz Quartet. This programme is being followed in February by the Tommy Chase Quartet and Henry Lowther's 'Still Waters', by Laka Daisical's 'Slav to the Rhythm' and in March by the Stan Tracey Octet, performing an Arts Council commission, Portraits. This commission comprises four pieces inspired by musicians who have given Tracey great pleasure over the years - Duke Ellington, Thelonious Monk, Sonny Rollins and Gil Evans. In April, the Bheki Mseleku band embarks on a tour with an entirely new suite of pieces commissioned with the assistance of funds from the Arts Council. Further details are available from Jazz Services, 5 Dryden Street, London, WC2 9NW. Tel (071) 829 8352.</p>

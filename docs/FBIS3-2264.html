			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Most-Favored-Nation Treatment Must Not Be </F> Linked With Human Rights"]    [Text] U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher said  yesterday that the human rights issue was the most important  topic of discussion in his visit to China next week.    The Chinese Government welcomes discussions on the human  rights issue. In fact, China's human rights situation is  continuously improving, and its human rights situation is better  than that of the United States in many areas. China's human  rights are of a broad, fair, and authentic nature. China places  itself in the lowest position in the world in criminal rate  terms. China goes ahead of the United States in approving and  carrying out the human rights treaties. Beginning in 1980, the  Chinese Government signed, approved, and participated in seven  international human rights treaties and has strictly and  conscientiously carried out its own obligations. The United  States participated in just one treaty, however, and refused to  accept the others because they were not "in conformity with"  U.S. interests. If the U.S. Secretary of State discusses "human  rights" so as to jointly safeguard and improve human rights and  the development of bilateral relations, naturally, this would be  worth welcoming. If he wants to link MFN treatment with human  rights and achieve political objectives by using "human rights"  as a weapon, he is bound to run into a stone wall.    A few days ago, Christopher said: Since September of last  year, U.S.-Chinese relations have entered a new stage. The  talks in Seattle between President Bill Clinton and President  Jiang Zemin were the most important proof of the new relations.  Following the meeting of Qian Qichen, vice premier of the  Chinese State Council and concurrently minister of foreign  Affairs and the U.S. Secretary of State Christopher, there were  a series of talks between senior officials of the two countries.  The governments of the two countries must have had broad  discussions and actively developed bilateral relations --  particularly economic and trade relations -- under such as a  good atmosphere and foundation. This is the wish of the peoples  of the two countries and is in their interest.    Over the past two years, major advances have been made in  economic and trade relations between China and the United  States. Large numbers of big U.S. enterprises have vied with one  another in investing in China. Hence, U.S. investment in China  has exceeded Japanese investment. More and more American people  have come to realize that "human rights" should not be a  condition and man-made barriers should not be erected in the  development of economic and trade with China, because the MFN  treatment that China and the United States grant one another is  a reciprocal preferential arrangement rather than a favor given  to one side by the other. Vice Premier Zhu Rongji was being  forthright when he said: MFN treatment is the foundation of  normal trade between China and the United States. If the  foundation is shaken, both sides will suffer. In fact, the  United States will be hurt more, not China. According to an  estimate, if China's MFN treatment is abolished, the American  consumers will have to spend an additional $14 billion a year;  the United States will lose 160,000 jobs; and the country's  aircraft industry will possibly lose $10 to 15 billion in  business over the next 10 years. Restricting economic and trade  relations between China and the United States by using "human  rights" criteria will make some Americans jobless and will  infringe upon their right to subsistence, which is the human  right of principal importance. This way of doing things, which  is formerly aimed at harming others, will end in  self-destruction.    The linkage of MFN treatment with human rights is a  violation  of the principle of respecting other countries' sovereignty that  is stipulated in the "United Nations Charter." Clause 7 of  Article 2 stipulates: "Nothing contained in the present Charter  shall authorize the United Nations to intervene in matters which  are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state."  Although the human rights issue has an international component,  it is a matter which is essentially within the domestic  jurisdiction of a state. The attempt of any country to impose  sanctions against other countries, to make indiscreet remarks or  criticism of the domestic matters which other countries handle  independently and state-to-state affairs, or to compel other  countries to relinquish their sovereignty to accept its values,  ideology, political standards, and development pattern by making  use of human rights is an act which violates human rights.    We strongly endorse the following view: Human rights first  of all represent the right to subsistence, and, in order to  secure the right to subsistence, a country must first of all  fight for the right of independence. This rule has been proven  time and again by the history of many countries. If a country  is deprived of its sovereignty, its people's personal rights  cannot possibly be safeguarded.    It seems difficult to understand why the United States,  while  posing as a "fighter for human rights," refuses to sign some  international conventions on human rights and has joined a  relatively small number of such conventions, claiming that in so  doing it wants "to vigorously defend the sovereignty of the  United States of America." On the other hand, however, the  United States is demanding that those conventions it has signed  be subordinate to the U.S. Constitution and laws. It also seems  difficult to understand why this country, while reproaching  other countries for their "poor human rights conditions," has  done its utmost to support some cases of massive and outrageous  infringements upon human rights. In fact, this only indicates  that the United States, in pursuing "human rights diplomacy,"  definitely does not mean to fight for human rights for other  countries or for some people, but to make use of the "human  rights" issue to interfere in others' internal affairs and sell  its own values, ideology, political standards, and development  mode. These deeds have of course been boycotted and condemned  by many countries.    What must be pointed out is that a small number of Chinese  who have been preaching human rights are groveling at the feet  of the westerners and begging foreign governments to impose  sanctions on their own country and deprive their own country of  sovereignty. Some people speaking at forums in the United States  have called for imposing conditions related to "human rights" on  the offer of MFN status to China. Some people speaking before  U.S. officials have urged the United States "not to extend  China's MFN status before substantial improvements are made in  mainland China's human rights record." Still others who have  been vigorously defending colonial rule and opposing China's  resumption of exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong are  criticizing the human rights condition in China by citing some  cases of judiciary actions that China has carried out in  accordance with the law. These people have abandoned even the  minimum standard for being considered Chinese, and they are  absolutely not qualified to talk of human rights! In preaching  "human rights" they are putting up a false front, concealing  their real motives. We should never lower our guard against  these people.</p>

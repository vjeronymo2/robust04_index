			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sulayman Nimr] </F>   [Text] Riyadh, April 2 (AFP) -- Saudi Arabia on Saturday  urged its Gulf allies to toe the line against Baghdad and  prevent it sowing division in the region, criticizing Qatar and  Oman for their rapprochement with Iraq.    Foreign Minister Prince Sa'ud al-Faysal said Iraq was  "working to divide the GCC" and was "still a threat to security  and stability in the region."    He urged the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) to "restate the  member nations' joint position on Iraq, to block any attempts"  to drive a wedge between Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab  Emirates (UAE), Oman, Bahrain and Qatar.    Observers said Prince al-Faysal, in his opening address to a  two-day GCC foreign ministers meeting in Riyadh, was implicitly  criticizing Baghdad's links with Oman and Qatar.    Oman was the only GCC country to maintain relations with  Baghdad after Iraqi troops invaded Kuwait in August 1990.    Qatar has also drawn closer to Iraq in the past few months,  arousing deep concern in Kuwait, which was liberated by a US-led  multinational coalition in February 1991.    In Cairo last weekend, the Omani and Qatari foreign  ministers  held talks with their Iraqi counterpart Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf  on the sidelines of an Arab League ministerial meeting,  officials said.    Al-Sahhaf described Iraq's relations with Oman, Qatar and  Bahrain as "good" at the meeting, they added.    The GCC session was also expected to cover the Middle East  peace talks, notably the multilateral track in which the Gulf is  involved. Qatar and Oman are to host Israeli delegations for  meetings of multilateral working groups.    Likewise on the agenda was Iran's territorial dispute with  the UAE, the official Emirates news agency WAM said.    In Cairo, the 22-member Arab League reaffirmed support for  the UAE in its dispute with Iran over three strategic islands in  the southern Gulf.    The UAE has warned it could resort to international  arbitration to resolve the dispute with Iran over the islands of  Abu Musa, Tunb al-Kubra, and Tunb al-Sughra. Iran insists the  problem must be tackled through direct dialogue.    The UAE and Iran had strong political and economic links  until the dormant dispute flared anew in 1992 following  accusations that Tehran had annexed the UAE part of Abu Musa and  expelled some of its residents.    The GCC defence, political and economic alliance was created  in May 1981 during the Iran-Iraq war.</p>

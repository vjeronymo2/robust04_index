			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / Chinese 'smash records' on dog stew and turtle BEIJING'S credibility as the host city for the Olympic Games in the year 2000 seemed undermined yesterday as much of the world athletics community cast doubt on the validity of a series of astonishing results by female Chinese athletes. Said one senior British athletic official: 'The Chinese may think this sort of result supports their claim to host the games. But the scale of the improvement is so good it arouses suspicions they are not observing the Olympic ethos.' Long-distance athletes have broken world records for 1,500m, 3,000m and 10,000m at the Chinese national games in the last week. The 10,000m record was slashed by 42 seconds. The results, achieved in front of 12 visiting members of the International Olympic Committee, came after Chinese women made a clean sweep of the medals last month at the world championships in Stuttgart. The committee makes its decision on September 23. Mr Alan Storey, general manager of the NutraSweet London Marathon, who coached in China during the 1980s, said: 'The Chinese must have been pleased by Stuttgart, but the recent world records detract from the bid because nobody believes they were achieved legally.' No evidence existed that the records were drug-assisted. Ma Junren, the athletes' trainer, dismisses accusations the results were helped by banned substances. He claims that high-altitude training and a special diet help the athletes prepare. Some are running 170 miles a week, equal to more than seven marathons in seven days. The diet includes caterpillar fungus tonic, dog stew, chicken soup, a paste made from berries, and soft-shell turtle. He also bases the women's running action on those of ostriches and deer. Dr Peter Radford, professor of sports medicine at the University of Glasgow, and chairman of the British Athletic Association, said: 'None of us know anything about the athletes, their histories or their training. And I don't have the foggiest about the diet'.</p>

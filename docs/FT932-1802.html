			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Amberley upturn in second half AMBERLEY, the USM-traded building preservation business with operations in France and Belgium, finished the year to March 31 with a pre-tax loss of Pounds 91,000, against a Pounds 73,000 profit. There was, however, a significant upturn in the second half, said Mr James Leek, chairman. An operating profit of Pounds 48,000 was recorded prior to exceptional costs of Pounds 60,000 relating to the resignation of Mr Dennis Buckley, the former chairman. In March, Mr Buckley and Mr Mark Pye, then managing director, sold the majority of their shares to Mr Robert Healy and Mr Brian Meddings, who became chief executive and finance director respectively. Mr Pye remains as managing director of the French and Belgian operations. Mr Leek became chairman in April; the same month Peter Cox placed its holding of 29.99 per cent of Amberley with institutions and with Mr Leek and his family. Turnover was Pounds 3.82m (Pounds 3.18m). Losses per share were 1.71p (earnings 0.46p) but the dividend is again 1p.</p>

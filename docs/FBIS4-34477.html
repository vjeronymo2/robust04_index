			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Elsy Fors: "Conference on Business With Cuba </F> Exceeds Expectations"]    [Text] Havana, 16 Jun (PL) -- It was reported today that  Cuba's image as an attractive destination for business, and  investment has been confirmed by the 125 businessmen expected  here beginning tomorrow to participate in a conference organized  by the British magazine THE ECONOMIST.    The information provided by Octavio Castilla, vice minister  for foreign investments and economic cooperation, indicated the  Cuban Government has been invited to present its proposals for  foreign investment and trade at this conference, which will be  held at the Nacional Hotel on 20 to 22 June.    The participants include Former Spanish Economics Minister  Carlos Solchaga; Cristine Stewart, Canadian minister of state  for Latin America and Africa; and six executives from the  Canadian Sherrit Company, which is cosponsoring the meeting. The  Canadian company is also an important investor in Cuba's  petroleum sector.    The organizers' original list of approximately 60 people has  doubled. They indicated that the reason for the event is the  dramatic changes in the Cuban economy, especially Cuba's policy  of opening up to foreign investment and its efforts to diversify  its foreign markets.    The introductory program distributed by THE ECONOMIST stated  that Cuba's current severe difficulties present enormous  challenges to the companies interested in the small Caribbean  nation. But far from detracting interest, this situation seems  to add incentives, judging from the participation in the  conference for which THE ECONOMIST set a registration fee of  $1,500.    Great Britain heads the list of participants with 29  businessmen, Canada follows with 28, Spain with 16, Germany with  13, Italy with seven, the Netherlands with five, and the United  States with 10, including two Cuban-Americans. Latin America  will participate with, among others, four delegates from  Colombia, three from Mexico, and three from Venezuela.    The program calls for an analysis of Cuba's current economic  situation and its outlook, international relations and regional  integration, monetary policy and banking system, trade policy,  industrialization strategy, incentives for foreign investment,  and testimony by investors in Cuba.    According to the organizers, the meeting, which is called  "Second Round Table With the Cuban Government," will enable  international investors and corporate executives to familiarize  themselves with and debate the aspects of Cuba that are of most  interest to them. The meeting will also include panels of  businessmen who are experienced in business dealings with Cuba.  These include Bert Denkers, general manager of the ING bank of  the Netherlands, and Michihiro Sindo, president of Daisin  International of Japan. As part of the round table, there will  also be workshops on key sectors of the Cuban economy, such as  the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, tourism, and  energy and mines.    Castilla said the participants include seven mining firms,  five tourism companies, five automobile industry  representatives, five consultants, and a similar number from the  academic sphere -- university researchers on Cuba. The Cuban  vice minister indicated that similar events were held in 1992  and 1993. They were organized by the British Euromoney  publishing house and successfully made known business and  investment opportunities in Cuba.    On this occasion, the meeting is enhanced by the promising  discovery of petroleum on the island -- precisely with the  participation of Sherritt from Canada -- and the profitable  operation of other firms involved in the tourism sector and  nickel mining, as well as the process of economic reforms whose  most recent chapter involved financial reorganization measures.    Official Cuban sources commented that an additional draw for  the participants is the on-site analysis of the limitations and  the cracks in the U.S. blockade against Cuba.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Paris, Jan 20 (AFP) -- Norwegian Prime Minister Gro  Harlem Brundtland discussed Norway's bid to join the European  Community during a meeting with French President Francois  Mitterrand on Thursday [20 January].    In a half-hour meeting with Mitterrand, Brundtland stressed  the need to find solutions to problems brought up in  negotiations over Norway's possible membership in the EC.    Addressing European Parliament deputies in Strasbourg  earlier  Thursday, Brundtland said negotiations over the expansion of the  EC could be concluded by March 1.    "This is an ambitious target, but if the political will is  there, it is feasible," she said.    The main obstacles to Norway's EC membership remain  agriculture and fishing, the prime minister said.    As for agriculture, Norway is seeking "some special  arrangements adapted to our climate and topographic situation,"  Brundtland said.    Oslo is also requesting "creative reflection" to solve the  problem of the management of northern Norwegian fishing areas,  she added.    "So far we have achieved encouraging results related to  energy and also regarding environmental standards. We have also  met a constructive approach to regional policy," she said.    The EC has fixed February 28 as the deadline for concluding  negotiations on EC membership with Norway, Austria, Finland and  Sweden, so that these countries may join the community in early  1995.    Speaking in Strasbourg Wednesday, Greek European Affairs  Minister Theodoros Pangalos, whose country currently holds the  rotating EC presidency, did not rule out that this deadline  could be extended.</p>

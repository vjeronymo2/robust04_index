			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets: European tyre makers face a flat future  -The sector may be heading for a period of underperformance Shares in European tyre companies could soon come off the boil if worsening conditions in the UK tyre replacement market spread to other markets, potentially endangering the sector's anticipated earnings recovery. Shares in Kwik-Fit, the UK tyre and exhaust fitter, have more than halved to 98p since the start of June; brokers cut their 1992 earnings forecasts following news from the company that tyre replacement sales had fallen in May, June and July, even although it had maintained its market share. Analysts were also told that customers were opting for cheaper tyre brands. The best performance since the start of the year has been produced by Michelin of France, which has the largest slice of the global tyre market. Its shares had outperformed the CAC-40 index by 74 per cent by July 31. Continental of Germany had outpaced the DAX index by 23.4 per cent by the same date; and Pirelli Tyre NV, the Dutch tyre subsidiary of Pirelli SpA of Italy, had outperformed the CBS General index by 37 per cent by June 3, although the gain was subsequently eroded to 28 per cent. The outperformance of Pirelli SpA against the Comit index fell, similarly, from 47 per cent on May 20 to 37 per cent. Mr Bob Barber at James Capel says that the rush to buy European tyre stocks was prompted by two separate price increases, the first last August and the second in April. 'Profits in the tyre industry are rising because of the better pricing and some improvement in the US, but share prices are well up with events,' he says. He expresses concern, however, that the recent news from Kwik Fit is not consistent with the news coming out of the tyre companies themselves. 'Any doubt about the pace of earnings coming through will have an impact on the share price,' he warns. Another worry is that the recent tyre price increases may not stick if worsening conditions in the tyre replacement market prompt increased competitiveness. There are two other reasons why the European tyre sector could be heading for a period of underperformance: the speculative fizz has evaporated, for the near future at least, following the a setback in Pirelli SpA's attempt to take over Continental; secondly, Michelin and Continental have made it known that they intend to have big rights issues, as and when their share prices permit. The failure of Pirelli SpA, for the second time, to remove shareholder voting restrictions at Continental's annual meeting in early July has left it with virtually no control over its investment. The Italian company has 5 per cent of its German target and options on a further 33.4 per cent. Furthermore, Continental's decision to pass the dividend on 1991 results means that Pirelli SpA will not be getting any return from its investment. 'Unless Pirelli finds the cash it will be difficult to achieve control of Conti,' says Mr Robert Willis at Hoare Govett. Even if the Italian company does succeed in finding enough money, it will be obliged to pay a big premium which, in his view, Continental's shares do not justify. Mr Willis says there have been vague notions that Pirelli might sell its stake in Continental to its Japanese rivals - both Yokohama Rubber and Toyo Tire already have links with the German company. But there is little evidence that this is about to happen. Mr Barber agrees that the takeover prospects have dimmed for now, but he is confident that eventually, 'something will be done'. He notes that, for instance, Pirelli succeeded in blocking Continental's application to shareholders for permission to increase its nominal share capital, as a prelude to a rights issue. Both Continental and Michelin need rights issues to strengthen their balance sheets, Pirelli SpA having tapped the market already earlier this year. Continental now has to consider other measure to raise funds, such as listing its Contitech subsidiary on the German stock market. But Michelin has no obstructions, and analysts believe that it will have a relatively heavy 1-for-5 rights issue with the new shares priced around FFr200. Michelin's primary need is to reduce its gearing which is currently running at about 260 per cent and a rights issue would cut that to around 150 per cent. Michelin also needs funds for its decision to introduce a new automated process which, it is claimed, could cut most production space to just 10 per cent of its present level.</p>

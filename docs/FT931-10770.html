			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Hambros wins Norwegian case HAS THE ghost of Hilmar Reksten, the 'Norwegian Onassis' whose bankruptcy in the 1970s nearly broke Hambros, the merchant bank, finally been laid? 'I sincerely hope so,' said Mr Christopher Sporborg, deputy chairman of Hambros, with some feeling. Yesterday Hambros won a court case in Oslo which it hopes will mark the end of an affair dating back to the 1973-74 oil shock and the shipping crisis that followed. Hambros was being sued for Pounds 200m, plus interest on that amount since 1989, by the Norwegian Guarantee Institute, which had guaranteed Mr Reksten's loans, and by the trustees of Mr Reksten's estate. Mr Reksten died in 1980. The plaintiffs had claimed that Hambros had known about a fortune Mr Reksten had allegedly secretly salted away in overseas tax havens to avoid Norwegian tax. Mr Sporborg said yesterday, 'if he had, we never got our hands on it'. As though Mr Reksten's shade could not resist a last laugh, Hambros shares were in turmoil yesterday as news of the bank's legal triumph took more than half an hour to filter through to the stock market. Hambros shares opened at 298p and moved little until at 12.01 the bank announced that judgment in the case had been issued in Oslo and a further announcement would be made. Fearing the worst, and that the bank might be made to pay the Pounds 200m plus sum, the shares plunged to 240p in the next few minutes. It was 12.34 before a statement saying the court found in Hambros' favour appeared on the Stock Exchange screens. The problem was that the 200-page judgment was in Norwegian. As soon as Hambros' lawyer in Oslo reached the word 'acquitted' in the document the message was passed to Hambros and on to the Stock Exchange. After that Hambros shares rapidly returned to the opening level and then gained another 15p to close at 313p. Mr Sporborg said that he expected another claim against the bank to be dropped now. Hambros has had to bear its own costs in the case. Hambros had lent 'hundreds of millions' to Mr Reksten, who owned a fleet of oil tankers, and Norwegian shipping owners generally in the 1970s, Mr Sporborg said. After the oil shock the tanker market collapsed and the Norwegian government set up the Guarantee Institute to help Norwegian shipping companies by guaranteeing their loans. After Mr Reksten's death Hambros came to a 'full and final settlement' in 1982 with the Institute and the trustees, which involved Hambros paying a substantial sum. Hambros had thought that was the end of the matter, but in 1989 the plaintiffs started proceedings against Hambros, saying new evidence had come to light that Hambros had concealed information. The court yesterday found that there was no new evidence and the 1982 agreement should stand.</p>

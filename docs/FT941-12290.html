			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Re-energising Magnet - Berisford's conglomerate plans Berisford International is quietly confident that this afternoon its shareholders will give the go-ahead for its proposed reverse takeover of Magnet, the kitchen and joinery manufacturer and retailer. It will be the first step in Berisford's planned transformation into a conglomerate. But now Mr Alan Bowkett, chief executive, has another worry. He fears that some brokers have been too eager to talk up the group's shares. With Berisford buying Pounds 138m of assets for a net Pounds 26m it is easy for outsiders to get carried away with the deal. The shares were suspended at 128p just before the announcement of the deal. They start trading again tomorrow. Kleinwort Benson, the securities house, has recommended clients to buy them up to 240p. A sweep organised among the company and its advisers for tomorrow's closing price has produced a more cautious range from 131p to 210p. Mr Bowkett has stressed his strategy is a long term one. He emphasises the difference between what he plans for Berisford in the 1990s and what he calls the 1980s style of conglomerates - get the share price up, do more deals on the back of a high rating, and use acquisition accounting to make them look good. In the 1990s, he says, conglomerates will not have asset price inflation and acquisition accounting to bale them out. Instead Berisford and its like will have to rely on 'real things' such as consistent unit cost reduction and differentiation through quality. Berisford, he says, will aim to take the best of Anglo-Saxon commercial attitudes and Japanese attention to detail and quality and apply them to basic industries. In the short term he lists three priorities. Bedding down Magnet is the first, with the continuing liquidation of the old Berisford assets - which might yield Pounds 30m in calendar 1994 - a close second. Then he wants to start the search for a US acquisition which he reckons will take a year. As for Magnet, Mr Bowkett has detailed plans for the business which have been developed over the last few months of due diligence investigations. This work has identified a number of areas where costs can be cut. For instance, Magnet's division of the business into trade and retail has produced two buying departments, each purchasing the same goods from the same suppliers. Put the two together and there should be cost savings and perhaps larger discounts. Another aim is to take advantage of the strong operational gearing of the business so that even without any recovery in its markets, sales and profits can be expanded by, for example, the introduction of new products. Magnet has segregated the trade customer from the retail, Mr Bowkett says, to the detriment of sales. Different kitchen ranges aimed at the two types of buyer has caused confusion. All that Mr Bowkett asks is that shareholders be prepared to take a medium-term view rather than look for a quick return. If the Magnet deal completes in March, he thinks it will take until September, Berisford's financial year-end, to start seeing an improvement. The clock starts ticking on October 1, he says, and he is willing to be judged on the 1994-95 results. See Observer</p>

			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Rational debate succumbs to party line - Political Notebook THE FIRST casualty of elections is rational debate. Between now and April 9 ministers and their shadows have a single priority: they must stick to what the respective party leaderships decree is the 'line'. The political imperative is that all the prominent figures speak with precisely the same voice. The content of their pronouncements becomes of secondary significance. There must be no splits, wobbles or divisions. For the next eight weeks party strategists and journalists will do little but scan every spoken and written word for such gaffes. Labour is most obviously vulnerable. The Conservative assault on its tax and spending policies took off because some of Mr John Smith's colleagues were heard playing slightly different tunes to those of the shadow chancellor. Mr Smith would prefer a Trappist silence - at least until after the Budget on March 10. His strategy has not won universal approval in the shadow cabinet. In any event neither he nor his colleagues can escape the questioning of the media. Inevitably, variations show up in the textual analysis. This was underlined again this week by Mr Roy Hattersley's comments on the top rate of tax. Differences of emphasis become behind-the-scenes rows and personality clashes. Party strategists argue for more rehearsals. Mr Smith is under pressure to simplify Labour's tax and spending pledges and re-issue them on a single sheet of paper. Discussion on the Labour front bench about possible changes to the way public borrowing is treated in the national accounts has been similarly troublesome. There is a perfectly good argument for adjustments to the present conventions. No private company could treat the receipts from asset sales as negative current spending, as the government does. But senior Labour strategists have decided that however coherent the case for change, it is better to try to suppress the debate. They find it too easy to see the headlines: 'Labour plans to fiddle the books.' The Conservatives have proved more adept at keeping to one line. The daily co-ordination exercise between the five ministerial musketeers led by Mr Richard Ryder is repaying its initial investment. Ministers anyway are more practised than their shadows. The day-to-day business of government inculcates the habit of sticking to the line. But the musketeers have decided that there are some debates in which they must not engage. Scotland provides the most obvious example. In private, ministers readily confess that the upsurge of nationalist sentiment north of the border may require a radically different approach after the election. But that must not even be hinted at in public before polling day. Until then the line must be that the only choice is between independence and the Union. That way the Scottish National party may take votes from Labour and in the process save some of the remaining Conservative seats. Mr John Major has not been immune from the pressures which have boxed in Mr Neil Kinnock over taxation. He has been obliged to give unequivocal commitments - not to increase value added tax, not to abolish the ceiling on National Insurance contributions - which foreclose perfectly rational options. Tacit collusion has so far allowed the two main parties to avoid the same trap on the environment. Neither seem ready to make it an election issue. Only the Liberal Democrats are willing to discuss the sharp increase in the price of fossil fuels which every politician with an interest in the subject regards as inevitable. As one minister puts it: 'We all know that in the end we will have to introduce some form of carbon tax. But for God's sake don't quote me.' It is not hard to imagine that the question will be put directly to Mr Major and Mr Kinnock over the next few weeks; or that both will answer that they would not dream of increasing domestic heating bills or, like the Liberal Democrats, putting 50p on the price of a gallon of petrol. So who loses from this widening gap between private reality and public pledges? In the first instance it is the voter, who is denied the rational debate. But perhaps the bigger loser is the winner of the election. Mr Major and Mr Kinnock are busy making their own straitjackets.</p>

			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Letter: The best bet that France can make Sir, John Plender's article, 'Le doomsday machine' (March 26), claims that France should abandon its franc fort policy mainly because of probable bank losses in property. The choice is easy: for all Frenchmen to lose overnight, say, 20 per cent of their purchasing power, measured in D-Marks, Swiss francs, dollars, yen. In addition is the certainty of increasing inflation versus property losses by the banks. Property losses by the banks will teach them that they should be more open to invest in the risky business of industry rather than in what they have imagined so far to be the no risk property market. Low inflation is guaranteed to lead to industrial investment, competitiveness, and increasing employment, with admittedly an unpredictable time lag. Devaluation is guaranteed to lead to inflation, wealth reduction and, at best, short-term competitive gain. The choice is easy. Long-term wealth] Furthermore, few things are as damaging to an exporting manufacturer as that his export profits can disappear overnight through currency fluctuations. Almost nothing will do more to facilitate trade than fixed exchange rates. Whether the French will succeed to maintain the parity between the D-Mark is a gamble, but is probably one of the best bets France can make - for France and for Europe including Britain.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, May 9 (TANJUG) -- President of the Bosnian  Serb Republic (R.S.) Radovan Karadzic's visit to Moscow has been  postponed probably until early next week, as he has not received  the necessary travel papers from the U.N. sanctions committee,  TANJUG learned here on Thursday.    The U.N. Security Council imposed in late May 1992 the  comprehensive and mandatory sanctions on the Federal Republic of  Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro) for its alleged involvement in  the civil war in neighbouring Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Grigoriy Karasin, senior official of the Russian Foreign  Ministry, said on Thursday that Karadzic's visit to Moscow would  be private, but he did not rule out the possibility of the R.S.  president's meeting with officials. He is coming to Moscow to  receive the `Mikhail Sholokhov' award for literature, but the  posssibility is not ruled out that he might meet with some  officials. This will depend also on the schedule of the  officials with whom Karadzic wants to hold talks, said Karasin.    In Moscow, Karadzic is to receive the award which was  conferred on him by the Russian Writers' Association in  acknowledgment of his literary work. The `Mikhail Sholokhov'  award was instituted two years ago at the initiative of the  Russian Writers' Association and the Russian writers' STMCK  Company.    Karadzic is the first foreigner to receive the award which  has so far gone to six Russian writers.</p>

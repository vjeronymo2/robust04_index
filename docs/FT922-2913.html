			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / Survey of Greece (3): Government is looking somewhat shaky - Politics THE longevity of Greek political leaders is such that young parliamentarians who aspire to high office must have more than the usual quota of patience. Retirement is something that the old party chieftains do not like to contemplate. Considering that the same three personalities have played leading roles in public life for the past 30 years, it is not surprising that the Greeks are less passionate about politics these days. When Mr Constantine Karamanlis, the elderly head of state, was rushed to London for a check-up recently, there was no debate over whether he should consider stepping down for health reasons. In fact, his presence is seen as a prop to political stability, although the job is merely ceremonial. Halfway through its four-year term, the conservative government of Mr Constantine Mitsotakis is looking somewhat shaky. His New Democracy (ND) party has only a one-seat majority in parliament now that Mr Mikis Theodorakis, the composer, has given up his cabinet post and decided to sit as an independent. It is important for Mr Mitsotakis that Mr Karamanlis should remain in office. As the founder of ND, he is thought to have a moderating influence on the conservative barons who might feel tempted to unseat the 73-year-old prime minister. At this point there are more prominent ND personalities outside the cabinet than in it - the result both of leading conservatives wanting to distance themselves from unpopular government policies and of Mr Mitsotakis's growing impatience with ministers who step out of line. Furthermore, if Mr Karamanlis were to depart, it would be almost impossible for the conservatives and socialists to agree on a new presidential candidate. Failure by parliament to elect a new president by a two-thirds majority on its third attempt would mean an immediate election. Despite their ideological differences, some socialists find the patriarchal Mr Karamanlis a reassuring figure. For all the protestations of Mr Andreas Papandreou, also 73, that he is in good enough shape to serve as prime minister again, several senior members of Pasok say they are happy to sit out a full term in opposition. This is a polite way of saying that Mr Papandreou, whose health has been in doubt since he underwent open-heart surgery four years ago, is no longer Pasok's undisputed leader. There are now even more candidates to succeed him than there are conservatives stalking Mr Mitsotakis. Yet Mr Papandreou's position was strengthened as a result of his acquittal by a special court of corruption charges connected with the 1988 Bank of Crete embezzlement scandal. Now that parliament has decided against pressing charges in another case, in which the former prime minister was accused of ordering illegal phone-taps of political colleagues and opponents, the socialists are well placed to take the offensive. The conservatives will be especially vulnerable in the next few months as they launch further spending cuts and debate extra revenue-raising measures while putting together the Greek plan for economic convergence with the rest of the EC. Mr Mitsotakis may even consider going to the country in search of a new mandate to pursue the radical reforms that will be needed. However, the socialists have not yet come up with an alternative economic policy. There is no shortage of competent economists in Pasok, but suspicions between rival factions run so deep that a coherent programme is unlikely to emerge. Instead, the party organisers have reverted to their old tactic of sloganeering. One deterrent to conservative thoughts of holding an early election is an irrevocable split in the left, pointing to increased support for Pasok in the future as dissatisfied leftwingers change sides. The communist-led Left Alliance, which participated in a brief coalition government with the conservatives in 1989, has broken up after a bitter ideological dispute in the Greek communist party (KKE). The Stalinist faction remained in control of the KKE - and of its extensive financial resources - while the reformists joined the moderate non-communist wing of the Alliance. Ironically, the split produced two much younger party leaders, both women. But with the opinion polls showing a sharp decline in support for both leftwing parties, neither Mrs Maria Damanaki of the Alliance or Mrs Aleca Papariga of the KKE seems likely to build a fresh image for her party. The division in the left has also upset the conservatives' electoral arithmetic. A new electoral law was passed in 1990 which favours both the front-runner and the third-placed party under Greece's complicated proportional voting system. But with the new political realities, either of the left-wing parties could have trouble winning the 3 per cent of the vote needed to secure representation in parliament.</p>

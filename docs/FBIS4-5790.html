			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 14 KYODO -- Japan condemned Thursday  [14 April] a bus bombing the previous day in Hadera, northern  Israel, which killed at least six people and wounded about 30.    The Foreign Ministry said in a statement that the Japanese  Government "strongly regrets" that civilians were victims in the  attack and offered its sympathies to their families.    "Japan strongly condemns this kind of terrorism by some  extremists, which is aimed at obstructing the peace process,"  the statement said.    Japan also regrets that Israel and the Palestine Liberation  Organization (PLO) have not yet agreed on the withdrawal of  Israeli troops from the Gaza Strip and West Bank town of Jericho  despite an historic declaration on principles on self-rule last  September in Washington.    The declaration stipulated the deadline for completion of  the  withdrawal as April 13.    Japan will continue to support the peace process, the  statement said.</p>

Bruho has banked $138,225 from  four wins, one second and one third in eight starts this year.  </P> <P> Trainer Yves Seguin gave Mr. Bolg two months off after the El Cajon Stakes  because of a minor foot injury suffered early in the race. The bay colt by  Bolger made a triumphant return in an overnight stakes at Santa Anita on Nov.  9. Mr. Bolg won the seven-furlong Messenger of Song Stakes by 6 1/2 lengths in  1:21.0.  </P> <P> In 10 starts this year, Mr. Bolg has earned slightly less than Bruho, with  $132,881 from three wins, two seconds and one third for owners H. and T. G.  Rael Jr. Eddie Delahoussaye, who guided him to victories in the Real Good Deal  and the Messenger of Song, retains the mount.  </P> <P> High weight in the field is Ken Qvale's Variety Road at 120 pounds.

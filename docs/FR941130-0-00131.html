			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The ANPRM sought comment on whether the rule should ban last-minute or post-departure price increases for admission to the event, one of the problems that allegedly occurred on the 1994 Rose Bowl tours. All commenters who offered an opinion on this subject felt that last-minute price increases should be regulated in some manner. The RG Travel Companies, NACA, the NCAA, ASTA, the Wisconsin Attorney General and Mr. Donald Hamilton stated that last-minute price increases should be banned. FBA and the Pasadena Tournament of Roses said that price increases at any time following purchase should be prohibited unless the consumer receives written notice that the operator reserves this right. The Pasadena Tournament of Roses also suggested that participants who cancel within a few days of notification of a price increase be entitled to a full refund. The Wisconsin Attorney General commented that on tours to special events, ``last-minute or post-departure price increases are common and are tantamount to extortion'' because other options may be sold out.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NHL stated that, in general, price increases should be banned unless the face value of the ticket has been increased subsequent to departure of the tour. However, for events with short lead times such as the Stanley Cup playoffs, the NHL said that the rule should permit tours on which participants are required to agree to purchase event tickets at the yet-unknown face price plus a service fee, as long as the consumer is given prominent notice of this fact.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some tours are promoted in conjunction with a special event, but do not include, and do not represent that they include, admission to the event. For example, there have been tours to the Super Bowl host city during the Super Bowl weekend that prominently feature ``Super Bowl'' in the headline of advertisements and flyers, but which do not include game tickets. The ANPRM asked whether the new rule should ban this practice, or require affirmative, prominent disclosure that admission to the event is not included.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All of the commenters that expressed an opinion on this issue felt that it should be regulated in some manner. The RG Travel Companies stated that they favored either banning the practice or requiring disclosure. The NCAA urged affirmative, prominent disclosure, ``if such tours are to be allowed at all.'' All others who commented on this point recommended prominent disclosure. The NHL and Pasadena Tournament of Roses submitted specific suggestions for minimum required typeface size for advertisements for such tours.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ANPRM solicited comment on the economic burdens of such a rule, and asked whether it would be impractical for events where the participants are known only a week in advance, e.g. the NCAA Final Four.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All of the parties that commented on this issue agreed that the rule can and should apply to events in which the participants are not known until shortly before the event. The RG Travel Companies commented that commitments centering around a particular team could be made contingent on that team qualifying for the event. The NHL stated that the rule may be burdensome for organizers of short-lead-time tours, but that this is justified by the benefit to consumers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ASTA, like NACA, said that the degree of advance notice is not relevant, and that an operator who markets an event-oriented tour before the participants are known should simply disclose that event tickets are not included in the advertised price. FBA commented that participating teams in college bowl games are generally known at least a month in advance, and also that any experience the Department has had with Super Bowl tours would be instructive, as the competing teams in that game are sometimes determined only a week before the game.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters pointed out that even though the participating teams in the NCAA Final Four (the example given in the ANPRM) are determined only the weekend before, the tickets are sold out months beforehand. Thus, the fact that the participants are not known until the final week has minimal impact on the availability of tickets and the feasibility of tours. The Pasadena Tournament of Roses asserted that any economic burden resulting from this rule would fall on ticket brokers and tour operators who buy event tickets from individuals in order to resell them. The Wisconsin Attorney General stated that consumer protection may be even more important in cases where event participants are determined at the last minute, because consumers have less time to investigate their options.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Air Transport Association (ATA, an association of large scheduled airlines) filed a comment stating that it expressed no opinion about whether, or to what extent, the current Super Bowl rules should be made applicable to tours to other special events. However, ATA said that DOT should not make air carriers responsible for assuring that tour operators comply with the new rule. NACA echoed this view, stating that carriers should not be made the guarantors of tour operators.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> The NPRM  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in this proceeding on October 6, 1994 (published October 13, 1994; 59 FR 51881). The proposed rule was very similar to that described in the ANPRM, which in turn closely tracks the existing rules for Super Bowl tours.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

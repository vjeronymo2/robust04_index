			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Public welcomes Clinton plan: Republicans say tax rises too high and spending cuts not enough PRESIDENT Bill Clinton and his cabinet yesterday embarked on the task of turning his four-year, Dollars 500bn (Pounds 352bn) package of tax increases and spending cuts into reality lifted by favourable public reaction, but facing hostility from Republicans. Overnight opinion polls, although narrowly based, suggested that three quarters of those who heard the speech approved of its proposals, 60 per cent of them enthusiastically. But Republicans attacked the package for raising taxes too much and cutting spending too little. They also questioned whether the efforts to reduce the budget deficit, which are concentrated in the later years of the four-year plan, would ever see the light of day. 'You hang your hat on what's going to happen three years from now. I'm sorry but people don't believe that in America and on Wall Street,' said Mr John Kasich, the senior Republican on the House of Representatives budget committee. This could spell difficulty for President Clinton's efforts to push his economic plan through Congress in a budget bill, which congressional leaders hope to complete before the August recess. Mr Dan Rostenkowski, however, who as chairman of the House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee is one of those with the most control over the package's legislative fate, said that voters might be well ahead of their representatives in recognising the need for sacrifice to deal with the federal budget deficit. 'I honestly believe that the people, generally, are more willing than the Congress to move in this area,' he said. Mr Clinton is hoping to capitalise on this sentiment with a series of public meetings across the country, appealing directly to voters to back his proposals. While Republicans are lining up en bloc against the bill, some Democrats, anxious not to be associated too closely with higher taxes before the 1994 elections, could also desert their president. Senator David Boren, a conservative Democrat from Oklahoma, yesterday urged Mr Clinton not to press the short-term stimulus component of his plan before he has won agreement on his broader deficit reduction proposals. 'That's getting the cart before the horse,' he said. If US voters react more favourably to the package, members of congress might be emboldened. After extending an olive branch to the Republicans in his speech to Congress on Wednesday night, Mr Clinton yesterday sharpened his criticism of their economic policies in a book: 'A vision of change for America.' In Congress, Mr Leon Panetta, the budget director, took the battle to his opponents in a sharp exchange with Mr Kasich. 'The problem is that we have had gridlock in the Congress because Republicans have always taken the position that you can't increase taxes on the wealthy and Democrats have always said you can't cut any programmes, and that produces gridlock. And you are now the perfect example through your arguments of the kind of gridlock that I think people are tired of,' Mr Panetta said. While the Clinton package is projected by the White House to reduce the budget deficit from Dollars 332bn this year to Dollars 206bn in 1997, administration officials yesterday warned that the deficit would start to climb again from 1998 unless healthcare costs are brought under control.

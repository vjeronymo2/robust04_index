The meeting is a followup to previous efforts  that were crystallized at the Tehran meeting of 7 June 1993,  which produced important positive results strengthenbing  cooperation and mutual understanding and tackling conditions in  the border areas with Iraq.    In this regard, the conferees attached special importance to  the situation in northern and southern Iraq, affirming their  countries' commitment to the unity and safety of Iraqi  territories for the sake of the region's peace and stability,  and also in order to get rid of the negative effects of the  Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, which not only caused great damage to  Iraq and Kuwait, but also adversely affected neighboring  countries.    Iraq, including both the northern and southern parts, is  still going through an anomalous, unstable situation due to its  invasion of Kuwait and the subsequent burdens -- hence the call  of the foreign ministers of the three countries urging the Iraqi  Government to cancel all restrictions and measures against Iraqi  citizens, which would help the return to a normal situation of  security, stability, and peace. It would also help foil all  plans and efforts to divide Iraq and disintegrate its unity.    It is understood that the unity of Iraqi territories and the  necessity to safeguard it from any divisions or disintegration  constitute a major factor, in fact, an indispensable condition,  for the security, peace, and stability of the region as well as  the unity of Iraqi territories. Above all, it is a national and  pan- Arab necessity dictated by the interests of the Iraqi  people and the entire Arab nation. Disintegration or division,  as often affirmed by Syria, has never been the method to resolve  any problem no matter how complicated on the regional level.    Therefore, the Iraqi people, despite all the circumstances  they are going through, are called upon to affirm the unity and  integrity of their territories. This is a general popular  desire on Iraqi, Arab, and regional levels. As noted in the  statement issued by the Istanbul meeting, the future of Iraq  will be determined by the free will of the Iraqis on the basis  of equality, democracy, and good neighborly relations.</p>

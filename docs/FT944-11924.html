			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Jamaica sells banana farms The Jamaican government has divested two of the island's largest banana farms to Fyffes of the UK and Producers Group, a local company. The companies, which market all of Jamaica's export bananas, paid USDollars 6m for a 95 per cent interest in the two farms, with Fyffes being the minority partner. The government is expecting improved production of bananas with the divestment. Mr Seymour Mullings, the agriculture minister, said exports of the fruit next year should reach 105,000 tonnes, which is the island's quota to the European Union. This year's exports are projected at 85,000 tonnes. Meanwhile, the marketing of bananas produced in the Windward Islands is being restructured with the creation of a new marketing company.</p>

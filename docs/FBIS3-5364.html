The Supreme Commander Comrade Kim Chong-il said to vividly  show the soldiers' life, as did in the show, is a very important  question in creative works and pointed out that the  entertainment group should well describe the lofty spiritual  world of the soldiers of the People's Army and how they  struggle, including their loyalty toward the party and the  leader, their spirit of devotion to serve the fatherland and the  people, indomitable revolutionary spirit, and revolutionary  comradely love.

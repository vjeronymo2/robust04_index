			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Appraisal by staff urged for chiefs Part of the pay of chief executives should be determined by employee appraisal, the MSF technical union says in a report today. It suggests that chief executives who expect employees to have part of their pay related to performance should put their own performance and pay to the same sort of test. A survey of MSF representatives in 472 organisations found that three-quarters wanted to be involved in the appraisal of their managers. The survey found that before the introduction of techniques such as human resource management and total quality management, 88 per cent of representatives were ambivalent to them. After they were introduced the proportion opposed to them doubled to 24 per cent. The report says that while new techniques such as empowerment promised greater employee control, only a tenth of those questioned thought this had actually happened. New Management: An MSF Guide.

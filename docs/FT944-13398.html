			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Survey of Morocco (10): Protection by the king - The Jewish community King Hassan's role as a bridge-builder in the Arab-Israel conflict is one which, for one generation, deeply angered many of his Arab peers and often puzzled western observers. Ten years ago the Moroccan Jewish community hosted a conference on Maimonides, the 12th century Jewish scholar who wrote his famous Guide to the Perplexed in Arabic. It was the first such Jewish conference in an Arab country for decades and Jews came from around the world, including Israel. Some Labour and Likud members of parliament who had been born in the kingdom attended, and a banquet to welcome the delegates was hosted by Sidi Mohammed, the Moroccan crown prince. While re-asserting support for the Palestinian cause, the king reiterated his country's long-standing policy of protecting its Jewish citizens and offered to mediate on talks between Israel, Arab nations and the Palestinians. Syria promptly withdrew its ambassador to Morocco but the event was a gesture to the Jewish community, a demonstration that Jews and Arabs could sit down and talk to each other. In the context of the Arab world the conference undercut hardline Arab states such as Syria and Algeria and bolstered the moderate camp led by Egypt, which in 1978 had signed the Camp David agreement, recognising Israel. Those familiar with Jewish history in Morocco were less surprised by the move, though still impressed. Most of Morocco's Jewish community - which has declined from 300,000 40 years ago to 8,000 today - descend from families which fled the Spanish inquisition after the Christian reconquest of Granada in southern Spain in 1492. They are regarded as 'dhimmi', ie protected persons but first and foremost as tribute bearers. Christians laboured under the same status at the time in all Muslim states. The Koran clearly states that non-Muslims are to be humbled. In the imperial cities of Morocco this injunction was respected for many centuries. The sumptuary laws were generally enforced. In addition to distinguishing garments and restrictions on mounts, Jews had to walk barefoot in some towns, in others only when passing in front of mosques. They were often forced to do odious tasks as corvee labourers. In the 16th century Leo Africanus, the travel writer, bears ample witness to the contempt in which Jews in the cities were generally held. It would be wrong, however, to conclude that they suffered more than the Christians and much more than the rest of the population - most ordinary citizens were frequent victims of pillage and rapine. However, as elsewhere in north Africa, there is no obsession with the Jews comparable to that found in medieval European literature, nor has there ever been the persecution seen in Europe in modern times. Most traditional Moroccan stereotypes of Jews may have been negative, but they were also peripheral. The mellahs, or Jewish ghettos, were usually built next to royal palaces to make them easier to protect and the sultans frequently turned to the Jewish community to help raise funds for projects or to negotiate treaties with foreign powers. This role as 'tujjar al sultan' was a corollary of the knowledge of foreign languages that many Jews had and their network of relations in the wider world. Such links were of particular importance in a country which for centuries turned its back on the Holy See and forced the ambassadors of foreign powers to reside in the port of Tangiers, on the strait of Gibraltar, summoning them to the courts in Fez or Marrakesh only when their presence was required. King Mohammed V, father of the present monarch, refused to give the Vichy authorities a census list of Jews during the second world war. He ensured that in those difficult years his Jewish subjects did not go unprotected. After independence, for a brief while the government boasted a Jewish minister. That is true again today, since the appointment nearly two years ago of Mr Serge Berdujo, who heads the Jewish community in Morocco, as minister of tourism. Other Jews play an important role, none more so that Mr Andre Azoulay, whose career includes co-founding the newspaper Maroc Information after independence in 1956 (it was closed by the authorities three years later), and a long spell in a senior position at Banque Paribas in Paris. He was the founder of 'Identity and Dialogue', a group of intellectuals which did much in the 1970s to bring together Jews of Moroccan origin who had emigrated to France, Canada and Israel, thus initiating better understanding of the 2,000-year history of the Moroccan Jewish community. Since 1991 Mr Azoulay has been King Hassan's adviser for economic and financial affairs. Born in Essaouira, the port town from which the family of Lord Hore-Belisha, the British politician, originated, Mr Azoulay has acted as the king's 'sherpa' for the conference which, later this month, will bring together Mr Itzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister; Mr Yasser Arafat, head of the Palestinian authority and hundreds of western and Arab businessmen. From 'tujjar al sultan' to 'sherpa', the connection is quite obvious, as trade links are publicly established between Israel and Morocco instead of the discreet bonds that have existed for many years. The extraordinary diversity of Jewish life that existed in Morocco for centuries, with Jewish communities differing among themselves even more than the Muslims, may never return. The spectrum ranged from the citizens of a coastal town who benefited from the protection of a foreign power to Berber-speaking Jewish cobblers settled in the midst of a dissident Berber tribe, from the prestigious descendants of refugees from Spain to inhabitants of mellahs in remote towns of the Berber heartland of Morocco in which chieftancies were elective. Important Israeli businessmen, such as Mr Amiran Sivan, president of Bank Hapoalim; Mr Eytan Chichinski, president of Koor, Israeli's leading industrial group; Mr Michael Freedman, president of the Dan hotel chain and Mr Itzhak Lendsmann, president of Tnuva, one of Israel's largest dairy producers, have started to pay visits to Morocco to discuss trade and investment opportunities. Mr Raphael Edery, the vice-president of the Knesset and Labour MP, is another recently visitor. The Omnium Nord Africain, Morocco's largest private group which is run by Mr Fouad Filali, the king's son-in-law and son of the prime minister, has set up Salam 2000 with the Spanish Banesto Bank, Koor and the Palestinian national fund. The group has a capital of USDollars 60m and aims to invest in the Palestinian homeland. Israeli irrigation specialists are already working in southern Morocco and 10,000 Israelis of Moroccan origin visit the kingdom every year. Direct air links are expected to follow soon. Whatever the future holds, the 10 years since Mr Rabin came secretly to Morocco to visit the king and the conference now being held in Casablanca have added an extraordinary dimension to nearly 2,000 years of relations between Jews and the Moroccan people.</p>

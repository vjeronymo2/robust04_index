			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Bock aims to make Lonrho interests his priority Dieter Bock, the German financier who on Thursday won his year-long battle to persuade Mr Tiny Rowland to quit the Lonrho board, last night pledged to sell all his outside business interests 'within at least two years'. He did this to allay widespread concerns that he might lack both the time and financial resources to take a long-term approach to the reorganisation of Lonrho. 'I will be involved only in Lonrho,' he said in his first interview since his victory against Mr Rowland. 'I have the firm intention in a controlled way to get rid of all my outside interests. That is completable in two years but it might not take as long as that.' However, he denied rumours that his private businesses are under financial pressure. He also stressed that he had 'no intention' of selling any of his 18.8 per cent Lonrho holding, which was last night worth Pounds 207m, compared with the Pounds 90m bank loan he took out to finance the purchase two years ago. His main private interest is Advanta, a German property company. He also has extensive property interests in South Africa and a joint venture with Lord Palumbo, the former Arts Council chairman, to develop the Mansion House site in London. He did not give details of how he intended to withdraw from the controversial London scheme. The value of his interests is difficult to assess, because he holds them through companies in the UK, Germany and the Netherlands. Mr Bock gave his priorities for Lonrho over the coming months: He wants to resume negotiations with Gencor, the South African mining conglomerate, to achieve a fusion of both companies' platinum interests, a deal which could create the biggest platinum group in the world; He plans to cut head office costs by more than Pounds 10m a year; He will dispose of any Lonrho interest which does not belong in either the mining, hotels, agricultural or trading divisions. He said he was also likely to consider whether to redevelop the group's headquarters, in the City of London's Cheapside. Lonrho's share price rose 12p yesterday to close at 144.5p. Mr Bock said he was relieved that the battle with Mr Rowland was at an end: 'It will take some time to really relax and move forward without the burden of having someone on my back.' He was not afraid of reprisals from Mr Rowland, the dominant force in the company for 33 years: 'He may try to hurt me with words, but I can cope with that.' No time to put his feet up, Page 9</p>

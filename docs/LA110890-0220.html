			<p><P> November 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARCHITECTURE;  </P> <P> BUILDING ON A COMPLEX PARTNERSHIP  </P> <P> Most architects find their clients by referral or through social connections,  but Eric Moss met Frederick Smith -- the man who was to become his most  important patron -- purely by chance.  </P> <P> "Back in 1987, I rented studio space in Culver City in a run-down industrial  structure owned by Fred's father," Moss recalled. "Fred and I got to talking,  and discovered we had many interests in common. One thing led to another, and  we ended up working together to transform a whole complex of old Culver City  buildings, that could take us the rest of the decade to complete."  </P> <P> The complex developed by Smith and designed by Moss already has won several  architectural awards, including a recent merit citation from the Los Angles  chapter of the American Institute of Architects. But it is only one of several  rundown Culver City properties that Smith and Moss are upgrading.  </P> <P> Through their collaboration, an untidy collection of industrial structures is  being converted into upscale office space for a wide variety of professional  and commercial tenants, from designers to insurance agents.  </P> <P> Though their meeting was accidental, Smith described his choice of Moss, one of  Los Angeles' leading avant-garde architects, as "somehow inevitable."  </P> <P> "Ben Smith, my father, had a simple rule I always follow: Work with people who  are as good or better than you are," Smith said. "When we met Eric, we knew he  was our man."  </P> <P> Despite the common ground Smith and Moss established early on, it took some  time for the developer and his architect to overcome the adversarial attitudes  that often charge the client-designer relationship.  </P> <P> "Fred's father was a tough guy," Moss said. "He made his priorities known  upfront and that meant a strict accounting of costs as well as a plan to create  something memorable out of the raw material of the old buildings.  </P> <P> "In the beginning, there was a lot of mutual tension and apprehension. But as  Ben, Fred and I got to know one another, our egos meshed and things began to go  more smoothly."  </P> <P> The Smiths had a vision that fused a shrewd financial investment with a desire  to create a work of architectural art.  </P> <P> Ben Smith, who died last year, had told his son he was "after an artist" with  the imagination to transform the decaying district next to the old Culver  Studios into an attractive office environment, without betraying its muscular  character.  </P> <P> The Smiths' financial vision foresaw that as studio space for smaller design  and professional firms became expensive in nearby Venice and Santa Monica,  Culver City would offer an affordable and accessible alternative. They  understood that to attract such image-conscious tenants, the architecture would  have to be special.  </P> <P> The Culver City properties are composed of two groups of industrial buildings  dating from the 1930s and '40s. One group on Ince Boulevard consists of the old  Paramount Laundry, the Lindblade Tower that houses Moss' studio, and a complex  of renovated offices for the Gary Group, an international public relations  firm.  </P> <P> The second cluster of buildings on National Boulevard consists of about 300,000  square feet of old workshops and warehouses that Moss is converting into small  studios and offices.  </P> <P> Described by Architectural Record magazine as "a choreographic tour de force,"  the National Boulevard complex epitomizes the way in which Moss has transformed  the simple sheds into a series of sophisticated spaces without betraying their  workday character.  </P> <P> In the L-shaped main gallery that Moss carved out of the old factory buildings,  the original rough timber posts and trusses remain intact, flanked by new white  walls. Wide skylights and internal glass walls are energized by architectural  extravaganzas, including a series of formal rotundas that help visitors find  their way through the jumble.  </P> <P> "On National and on Ince, we found a direct and affordable way to galvanize a  ramshackle bunch of old buildings," Moss said. "We did this by carefully  judging where we should add something spectacular -- like the rotundas -- and  where we should leave well enough alone. Fred's contribution is to have found a  way to make all this financially compute."  </P> <P> "My role is to create the practical context for Eric to do his thing," Smith  said. "As we've come to know and trust and like one another, the boundaries  between what he does and what I do becomes blurred. The collaboration is now  more or less seamless."  </P> <P> Fred Smith, who had never worked with an architect like Moss before, said he  quickly came to respect him. Despite Moss' reputation as a quirky architect  prone to such eccentric gestures as the use of angled sewer pipes as structural  columns, Smith found him to be "thoroughly practical" in his approach.  </P> <P> "My only regret is that we can't allow Eric to be as creative as he could be,"  Smith said. "The complex financial and social ecology of development such as  this is so fragile, an extra butterfly could unbalance it. My job is to see  that doesn't happen, without killing the creativity."  </P> <P> Smith attributes his sensitivity to art and artists to his mother, a noted Los  Angeles collector. Before her death, Dorothy Smith supported the work of  avant-garde painters and sculptors long before they were famous.  </P> <P> As a young man, Smith discussed the interaction of art and architecture with  his parents at the family dinner table.  </P> <P> "When I met Eric, it was the ideas my mother had expressed that made it easy  for me to sympathize with his aspirations," Smith said.  </P> <P> Now in his 50s, Smith has a halo of gray hair and a soft face dominated by  brown eyes. After a restless youth traveling in Europe and the United States,  he joined his father's development firm. His lifestyle, still unconventional,  includes a dislike of neckties and a fondness for the weathered 1974 Cadillac  De Ville that is his mobile office.  </P> <P> Moss, 46, is craggy and awkwardly eloquent. He described his hope that people  who visit or work in the Culver City spaces he is creating would feel "like  somebody punched a hole in the sky." He talks passionately of creating  "insights into the idea that things are discoverable," and sees his approach to  architecture as similar to James Joyce's way with language in "Ulysses."  </P> <P> "Joyce took an ancient, Homeric form and transformed it into a modern idiom by  revitalizing the language," Moss said. "He both honored Homer and recreated his  epic style by creating a very contemporary sense of discontinuity. . . ."  </P> <P> Hearing this, Smith smiles. "We often have chats like that," he said. "In fact,  I think Eric is more articulate about books than about buildings. Architecture  is too close to his heart for him to be entirely lucid about it."  </P> <P> Both men are deeply engaged in what they see as a vital act of urban  recolonization with their conversion of derelict buildings into thriving work  environments.  </P> <P> "We've learned a lot from one another, and from the hard lessons of the project  itself," Moss said. "I guess we've both learned how to make art within the  demands of the market without compromising one or the other, and without  antagonism."  </P> <P> As the years pass, Moss said, he and his client have become more and more  compatible.  </P> <P> "Fred's become part of me, and I've become part of him. It's a true marriage of  minds."  </P></p>

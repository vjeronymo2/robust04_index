			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / International Company News: Tighter cable rules hit Comcast Comcast Corporation, the cable and cellular telephone group which this month agreed to merge with the QVC home shopping channel, recorded a net loss of Dollars 12.9m, or 5 cents a share, for the three months to June 30, The figures, which compare with a net loss of Dollars 17.1m, or 8 cents, in the same period last year, reflect the impact of tighter federal regulation of cable services, in spite of healthy consumer demand for cellular services. Mr Brian Roberts, Comcast's president, reported that 'subscriber growth in cable and cellular businesses continued at a very healthy pace during the second quarter'. However, revenues were static at Dollars 340.6m, compared with Dollars 340.1m, and operating cashflow fell by 6.9 per cent to Dollars 148.6m following moves by the Federal Communications Commission to curb the prices charged by cable operators. Consumer demand for cellular services provided some compensation and during the second quarter 'subscriber additions proceeded at the vigorous pace' of the preceding six months, Mr Roberts said. The results contributed to a half-year loss of Dollars 40.2m for the six months to June 30, against a net loss of Dollars 783.7m in the first half of last year. The 1993 six-month loss was struck after a one-off charge of Dollars 742.7m following a change in accounting for taxes and employee benefits. Operating cashflow of Dollars 290m for the six months fell by 5.2 per cent. The dividend is unchanged at 2.3 cents a share for the quarter, making an unchanged 4.7 cents for the half year. Earlier this month Comcast and Liberty Media Corporate agreed to acquire QVC as part of plans to improve Comcast's programming capability. That followed Comcast's agreement in June to buy the US cable TV businesses of Maclean Hunter for Dollars 1.3bn. Comcast estimates the Maclean deal will make it the US's third largest cable operator.</p>

			<p><P> January 10, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUPREME COURT TO RULE ON 'DIAL-A-PORN'  </P> <P> The Supreme Court said Monday that it will decide whether Congress may outlaw  so-called "dial-a-porn" messages, the sexually explicit telephone recordings  that callers can reach through the 976 exchange.  </P> <P> The high court said that it will review a ruling, issued in Los Angeles in July  by U.S. District Judge A. Wallace Tashima, on the Telephone Decency Act of  1987, which makes it a crime to offer "by means of telephone . . . any obscene  or indecent communication for commercial purposes to any person."  </P> <P> In his split ruling, Tashima upheld the part of the law banning "obscene"  messages, but he struck down the ban on less explicit "indecent" messages.  </P> <P> Both the Los Angeles company that challenged the law, Sable Communications of  California, and the Federal Communications Commission appealed Tashima's ruling  (Sable vs. FCC, 88-515, and FCC vs. Sable, 88-525).  </P> <P> Despite many past court rulings, both "obscenity" and "indecency" are somewhat  hazy legal concepts. Nevertheless, the high court has made it clear that a  local community, through a jury, can decide what is obscene.  </P> <P> Lawyers for Sable, which sells dial-a-porn services, contend that the law  violates the free speech clause of the First Amendment. They say that Tashima's  ruling would permit federal prosecutors to file suit in a "less tolerant" city  such as Salt Lake City, charging that its dial-a-porn messages were obscene.  That could have the effect, they say, of forcing adults in Los Angeles to live  by standards set in a far more conservative community.  </P> <P> U.S. attorneys maintain that the government has the right to protect children  from indecency and there is no way to stop minors from calling dial-a-porn  services.  </P> <P> In the past, the justices have struck down most government attempts to regulate  sexually explicit books, magazines or movies. But in 1978, the court took a  different tack regarding television and radio. These broadcasts are "pervasive"  in the home and children have easy access to them, the court said.  </P> <P> The dial-a-porn cases, to be argued in April, require the justices to decide  whether telephone services can be regulated like television, because children  can be exposed to them, or like a movie, because they require an individual to  seek out and pay for the service.  </P> <P> Begun in the early 1980s as telephone companies offered new for-pay services,  the pre-recorded sexual messages, which usually cost $2 in addition to any  toll, have become a big business. By 1984, dial-a-porn services averaged  800,000 calls a day, prompting the move in Congress to ban the business  entirely.  </P></p>

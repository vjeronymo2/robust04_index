			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Letter: Why Lamont's removal from office was just (1) Sir, In his article, 'Hounded out by fiction and foes' (June 4), Bill Robinson asked: 'Why did we keep on reading that the City had lost all confidence in the chancellor?' and then basically fails to provide an answer except by reference to Mr Lamont's numerous indiscretions in his private life. The real reason why the financial community 'gave up' on Mr Lamont, and is close to doing the same on the prime minister, is that both men, having pursued an economic policy which was clearly not in the country's best interests, were only forced to change tack following the UK's brutal ejection from the exchange rate mechanism. Like the Bourbons they seemed incapable of learning from their mistakes and, if Mr Lamont's removal from office was the result of pressure from the media, then the reporters concerned have done the country a considerable service.

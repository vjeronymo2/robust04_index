			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many commenters believed that the proposed rule was so broadly worded that it could be understood to apply to every situation where the extra time and the intermediate sanctions did not produce compliance. These commenters asked that we revise the regulation to use the continuation of payment during remediation provision in only in the most egregious situations where the Secretary disagrees with the State survey agency regarding termination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Sections 1819(h)(2)(C) and 1919(h)(3)(D) of the Act do not provide any flexibility about the seriousness of a deficiency in applying the continuation of payment during remediation provision. Indeed because the statute in both places makes reference to the payment limitations being triggered if a facility is ``not in compliance with  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> a <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  requirement of subsections (b), (c), or (d)'' (emphasis added), we believe that the Congress was focusing on any deficiency that might cause a facility to not be in substantial compliance, not just cases of egregious noncompliance. Therefore, we cannot accept the commenter's request.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter recommended that we add the following sentence at the end of proposed &sect;488.232(a)(1)(i): ``In considering whether it is more appropriate to impose alternative remedies than to terminate the facility, the State shall take into account the relative effects on the facility's residents of relocation and remaining in the facility, including the availability of suitable alternative placements for them.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We are not adopting this recommendation because there may be instances when termination is necessary despite the fact that it will cause some hardship to residents. As noted earlier, usually, HCFA and the State will impose alternative remedies prior to terminating a facility; however, there may be instances where this is not possible. For example, a facility could refuse to allow access to the surveyors, or could refuse to submit a plan of correction. A facility might also remain out of substantial compliance with requirements after an up to 6-month period allowed for correction, at which time the Act would require termination despite hardships to the residents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters urged us to delete the provision at paragraph (a)(2) that HCFA or the State may terminate the SNF or NF agreement before the end of a 6-month correction period if the criteria in paragraph (a)(1) of this section are not met. Commenters believed that the Act does not authorize HCFA or the State to terminate a provider agreement if a facility does not meet the threshold criteria (that is, the State survey agency finds that it is more appropriate to impose an alternative remedy than to terminate the facility; the State has submitted a plan and timetable for correction approved by HCFA; and the facility, in the case of a Medicare SNF, or the State, in the case of a Medicaid NF, agrees to repay the Federal government payments received if corrective action is not taken in accordance with the approved plan of correction). Commenters believed that once a determination is made to invoke the continuation of payment provision, a facility should not be terminated or have its Federal funding discontinued unless it is found on a subsequent survey to present immediate jeopardy, or the 6 months expire and the originally cited deficiencies have not been corrected. On the other hand, a few commenters recommended that we change the section to read ``HCFA or the State must terminate'' rather than ``may terminate'' as it was proposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We disagree with these commenters. First, on its face, the statute does not limit the authority of the Secretary to deny further payments to facilities or States under these provisions to only those cases where deficiencies pose immediate jeopardy. Rather, the statute speaks to all providers which do not meet ``a'' requirement of the Act. Second, the States and the Secretary have plenary authority to terminate provider agreements any time there is facility noncompliance, and sections 1819(h)(2)(C) and 1919(h)(3)((D) pose no limitation on that authority. If the State survey agency does not prefer an alternative remedy in lieu of termination to remedy noncompliance, the Act compels the Secretary to cease payments to the facility under Medicare or the State under Medicaid. If the State survey agency prefers an alternative remedy in lieu of termination and the other two criteria are not met, the Secretary does not have authority to continue payments under either program. However, if the State survey agency prefers termination, we cannot preclude a State from imposing additional remedies while the termination is pending, which can be up to six months from the last day of the survey. Therefore, we are not accepting the commenter's suggestion that we should continue Federal funding unless we found on a subsequent survey that deficiencies present immediate jeopardy, or the 6 months have expired and the facility has not corrected the originally cited deficiencies. To do so would be clearly inconsistent with the Act, as we have discussed above. Neither immediate jeopardy nor a full 6 months of noncompliance have to have occurred in order for the State or HCFA to terminate a provider agreement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

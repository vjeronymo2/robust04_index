			<p><P> June 13, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> OCTD PUTS 67 REPAIRED BUSES BACK INTO SERVICE  </P> <P> All 67 Orange County Transit District buses recalled on May 4 for repair of  cracked suspensions were back in service as of Monday, with transit officials  planning to fine the manufacturer $145,700.  </P> <P> OCTD spokeswoman Joanne Curran said the buses were phased back into service  gradually rather than all at once, with most back in service last week.  </P> <P> "There was no loss of service, and we anticipate no loss in revenue to the  district," said Curran. However, she said, OCTD maintenance crews worked an  undetermined amount of overtime to keep other buses rolling, and the district  will absorb that expense.  </P> <P> Curran said Hayward-based Gillig Corp. paid for reinforcing a bracket  underneath the rear suspension of the buses, although the district does not  know how much the repairs cost.  </P> <P> Curran said the fine of $145,700 was based on a rate of $100 per day for each  bus that was out of service. The bill has not been mailed yet, she said.  </P> <P> Gillig Corp. officials could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> The buses were pulled out of service after two rate rear-end suspension  collapses with passengers aboard. The passengers were transferred to other  vehicles while the damaged buses were towed away.  </P></p>

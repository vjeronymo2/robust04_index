The document notes that there was an in-depth exchange of  opinions on a broad range of issues of mutual interest during  the course of the talks with Russian President Boris Yeltsin and  conversations with other Russian officials. Particular  attention was focused on questions regarding the further  strengthening of bilateral ties and cooperation in the spirit of  the points of the treaty of friendship, cooperation, and mutual  assistance of 25 May 1992 between the Russian Federation and the  Republic of Kazakhstan.    The sides expressed satisfaction at the dynamic development  of Russian-Kazakh relations and noted their positive role in  solving complex problems during the period of transition that  both countries are experiencing, as well as in strengthening the  Commonwealth of Independent States, and in ensuring stability in  the Euro-Asian region.    An agreement was reached on new forms of economic  cooperation, in particular on the setting up of transnational  production and other corporations and of joint  financial-industrial groups.    An important part in the talks was taken up by questions of  interaction in ensuring reliable security within the framework  of a common military-strategic space. Agreements were reached  on various aspects of military and military-technical  cooperation.    The Russian side welcomed Kazakhstan's joining the treaty on  the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons as a state that does  not possess nuclear weapons, and it considers this step to be an  important contribution to the strengthening of global stability  and universal peace. President Nazarbayev handed the document  on the Republic of Kazakhstan's joining of this treaty to  President Yeltsin as head of the depository state.    Agreements were reached regarding a practical solution to  questions of the dismantling of nuclear weapons on the territory  of Kazakhstan and on the use of their components.    The sides expressed satisfaction at the conclusion of an  agreement on the Baykonur cosmodrome, in which fundamental  questions were resolved on the use of this complex in the  interests of the civil and space defense programs of the Russian  Federation, the Republic of Kazakhstan, and other countries of  the CIS. They intend to complete in the near future the working  out of specific accords on the practical implementation of this  agreement.</p>

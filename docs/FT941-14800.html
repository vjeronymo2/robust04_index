			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / Russians to stay in Baltics, says Kozyrev Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, indicated yesterday that Russian troops would stay in the Baltics in spite of commitments, repeated at the US-Russian summit last week, to withdraw them as soon as possible. Mr Kozyrev told a conference on Russian policy towards the countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States and the Baltic states that complete withdrawal of troops 'from this region' would be against Russia's interests  -because it would create a security vacuum and because it would leave ethnic Russians undefended. Both Tass and Interfax news agencies indicated that Mr Kozyrev had included the Baltic countries in his remarks on the troop pull-out. 'We should not withdraw from these regions which have been in the sphere of Russian interests for centuries and we should not fear these words,' Tass quoted him as saying. In Washington, a State Department spokesman said clarification might be sought as the remarks were at odds with statements by President Boris Yeltsin during President Bill Clinton's recent visit to Moscow. The remarks, if confirmed as applying to the Baltic states of Estonia and Latvia (Russian troops have already left Lithuania), will stir alarm in those countries. They have long warned that Russian commitments to pull out troops were hostage to political shifts in Moscow. The remarks are surprising from a liberal minister like Mr Kozyrev. In identifying the protection of ethnic Russians in the former Soviet states as 'one of Moscow's main strategic interests', he is stealing some of the rhetoric of Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky's Liberal Democratic party and delivering a pointed warning to Estonia and Latvia, where citizenship laws have withheld voting rights from non-ethnic Balts until language and other criteria are met. Russia has military bases in all former Soviet states except Lithuania and Azerbaijan. Areas of tension apart from the Baltics include Moldova, where the 14th Army under General Lebed guards the Russian-speaking population in the Trans Dnestr region, and Ukraine, where ownership of the Black Sea fleet in its Crimean bases is in contention between Russia and Ukraine - a contention which would be increased by the election of a president of Crimea who favours union with Russia, as now seems likely.</p>

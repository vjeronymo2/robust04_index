			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / Fatal work accidents lowest ever Fatal accidents at work are at a record low level, the Health and Safety Commission (HSC) said yesterday. Provisional figures in the HSC annual report for 1993-94 said that 379 people were killed at work during the year, compared with 452 in 1992-93. Recorded injuries which caused three or more days' absence from work fell by over 8,000 to 134,000 - but the real figure, including unreported accidents, is believed to be three times greater, which Mr Frank Davies, HSC chairman, said was 'disgracefully high'. Mr Davies said the UK had been free of large injury accidents in recent years though there had been a few 'near big ones', including a fire in February at Associated Octel in Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, and an explosion at Texaco's refinery in Milford Haven in July. Welcoming the accident reductions, the Trades Union Congress calculated that HSE measures could have saved the economy more than Pounds 200m last year, including Pounds 70.5m in output because of a reduction in the number of reportable injuries. Mr John Rimington, director general of the HSE, highlighted asbestosis-related diseases which, he said, were causing three times as many deaths as workplace accidents every year. He said: 'Demolition and construction workers are still exposed to this fibre which is one of the biggest killers in society.' The number of people claiming compensation for occupational asbestosis, he said, had increased threefold since 1981 and would continue to rise. He added: 'Thousands of tonnes of asbestos insulation and board remain in buildings. It is not easily identified.' The HSE, he said, was planning an asbestos awareness campaign within the construction industry in the New Year.

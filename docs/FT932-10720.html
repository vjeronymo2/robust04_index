			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Arts: Today's Television 'Well no, I was not actually there, but spiritually I was.' If missing soixante-huit is one of the regrets of your life, you will need no urging to listen to Mai (Radio 3, 10.45). Dig out your faded T-shirt of Herbert Marcuse and open a packet of Gitanes. This programme promises to be a highly evocative sound-picture of that heady, never to be forgotten, month in Paris. Radio 3's 1968 season continues with Midnight Oil (11.30), featuring survivors such as Pink Floyd. In comparison, TV is pretty dire. If you do not look remotely like Dad, beware of watching Public Eye (BBC 2, 8.00). Apparently, thousands of Britons are not their fathers' children. Their putative fathers were infertile and sperm was provided by anonymous donors. Popular culture in France will face lean times if the new government drops the subsidy to rap artists and rock bands. Europe Express (Channel 4, 8.00), visits a subsidised school for rock managers. It also reports on Berlin, where the Bulgarian artist Christo has come up against Chancellor Kohl. The former is a wrap artist who wants to wrap up the Reichstag. Mr Kohl fails to see the point.</p>

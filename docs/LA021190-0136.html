			<p><P> February 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE BASKETBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> SYRACUSE'S QUICK START FINISHES CONNECTICUT WIN STREAK  </P> <P> Syracuse got off to a quick start and Connecticut finished strong, but the  sixth-ranked Orangemen emerged from Saturday's Big East Conference game with a  90-86 victory at Syracuse, N.Y., before a Carrier Dome record crowd of 32,820.  </P> <P> Forward Derrick Coleman scored a career-high 29 points as Syracuse avenged last  month's 70-59 loss in Hartford, Conn. The Orangemen, who ended the Huskies'  10-game winning streak, have won six consecutive games.  </P> <P> "We really got out to a good start and that's what we had to do against this  team," said Syracuse forward Stephen Thompson, who added 19 points. "Last time  we came out slow and we never did get going. This time we wanted to come out  fired up and do the job right."  </P> <P> Billy Owens, who scored 21 points for Syracuse, said: "I think we kind of  shocked them a little bit. We wanted to get out to a big start on them early,  because when we get that kind of jump early, it's hard for anybody to catch up  to us."  </P> <P> But No. 8 Connecticut almost did.  </P> <P> Syracuse led, 81-71, with 2:10 to play, but the Huskies chipped away down the  stretch. Syracuse made 17 of 22 free throws over the final seven minutes.  </P> <P> "About a month ago when we beat Syracuse, people asked me what was wrong with  Syracuse," said Connecticut Coach Jim Calhoun. "I said, 'Nothing. Syracuse is a  great basketball team.' Tonight, they put us in a hole early, and they didn't  let us out of that hole. And we're not an easy team to keep in such a hole."  </P> <P> Syracuse is 18-3, 7-3 in the Big East. Connecticut (20-4, 7-3) was led by Chris  Smith's 25 points, all in the second half.  </P> <P> </P> <P> OTHER TOP 25 TEAMS  </P> <P> No. 1 Missouri 107, Nebraska 85 -- Doug Smith scored 44 points, including 12 in  a 23-9 run beginning the second half, as the Tigers won their 29th consecutive  home game.  </P> <P> Smith, a 6-foot-10 senior whose previous career high was 32, fell just two  points shy of Missouri's single-game record.  </P> <P> The Tigers (22-2, 8-1 in the Big Eight Conference), whose top ranking fell into  jeopardy Thursday night with a 65-58 loss at Kansas State, appeared listless in  the first half.  </P> <P> But Smith scored six of the first eight points in the second half to help turn  a close game into a rout. The Huskers (9-12, 2-6), who earlier in the week  snapped a 17-game road losing streak with a 91-82 victory at Colorado, were led  by Rich King with 25 points.  </P> <P> No. 2 Kansas 88, Iowa State 83 -- Kevin Pritchard scored 18 points and the  Jayhawks took advantage of a four-point play late in the game to move into  position for a return to the top of the national rankings.  </P> <P> Kansas (24-1, 7-1 in the Big Eight) had to survive a shaky final minute to  break a six-game losing streak at Iowa State.  </P> <P> Four other players scored in double figures for Kansas, which hosts Missouri on  Tuesday.  </P> <P> Iowa State (7-13 and 2-6) lost for the seventh time by five points or less.  </P> <P> Kansas was clinging to an 82-81 lead when Mark Randall was fouled by Brian  Pearson as Jeff Gueldner hit a jump shot from the top of the key. Randall made  both free throws for an 86-81 lead with 1:03 left and the Jayhawks held on.  </P> <P> Baylor 82, No. 3 Arkansas 77 -- David Wesley scored eight of his 23 points in  the final two minutes at Waco, Tex., as the Bears avenged an earlier 99-84  loss.  </P> <P> Baylor's victory also snapped a 12-game Arkansas winning streak and handed the  Razorbacks their first loss in the Southwest Conference.  </P> <P> Wesley, who missed 11 games because of a stress fracture of the right leg  before returning on Wednesday against Texas, hit six free throws and got a  basket off a steal in the closing minutes. For the game, Wesley hit 12 of 12  free throws.  </P> <P> The game was tied, 70-70, before Wesley took charge. The Hogs scored only two  baskets in the final 3:07.  </P> <P> Arkansas was led by Lee Mayberry, who had 16 points. Todd Day, who was  averaging 20 points, was held to nine.  </P> <P> Arkansas dropped to 20-3 and 11-1 in the SWC. Baylor is 13-9 and 5-6.  </P> <P> No. 4 Duke 114, Maryland 111 -- Phil Henderson scored nine of his 26 points in  overtime after the Blue Devils had to rally from an 11-point deficit in the  final five minutes of regulation at College Park, Md.  </P> <P> Duke (18-4, 8-2 in the Atlantic Coast Conference) came back from a 103-102  deficit in overtime with seven consecutive points, four by Henderson and three  by Alaa Abelnaby, with 1:16 remaining.  </P> <P> After Jerrod Mustaf, who scored a career-high 35 points for Maryland, converted  a three-point play eight seconds later, Christian Laettner hit the front end of  a one-and-one free throw opportunity to give Duke a 110-106 lead with 42  seconds left.  </P> <P> Laettner led Duke with 26 points.  </P> <P> Evers Burns then made a layin with 31 seconds left to get Maryland within  110-108, but Henderson made two free throws two seconds later and Bobby Hurley  sank two more to clinch the victory.  </P> <P> Maryland, which lost for the 11th time in 12 games to Duke, dropped to 13-10  and 3-6.  </P> <P> No. 5 Georgetown 56, Florida 40 -- Alonzo Mourning scored 10 of his 14 points  during a 16-1 first-half run to lead the Hoyas in a nonconference game at  Landover, Md.  </P> <P> Georgetown (19-2) has won four consecutive games. Undermanned and undersized  Florida (6-13) has not won since Jan. 13, dropping eight in a row.  </P> <P> Georgetown trailed 9-1 and 15-10 before rallying behind Mourning to take a  26-16 halftime lead. The Hoyas, who got 15 points from Mark Tillmon, never let  the lead slip below nine points in the second half.  </P> <P> Stacey Poole scored 12 points for Florida.  </P> <P> No. 11 Louisiana State 119, Tennessee 113 -- Chris Jackson scored 49 points at  Knoxville, Tenn., including 10 three-point baskets, as the Tigers took over  first place in the Southeastern Conference.  </P> <P> Jackson scored 17 points in a 31-13 run midway through the second half as LSU  (19-4, 9-3) broke away from a 61-61 tie to take a 92-74 lead.  </P> <P> Allan Houston scored 43 points for Tennessee (12-9, 7-5). The Volunteers fought  back to within 112-106 on a three-point basket by Greg Bell with 1:49 to play,  but could get no closer.  </P> <P> No. 14 La Salle 99, Manhattan 78 -- Lionel Simmons scored a career-high 40  points and moved past Elvin Hayes into eighth place on the NCAA scoring list in  a Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference game at New York.  </P> <P> La Salle (19-1, 10-0) never trailed in opening a 45-38 halftime lead. The  Explorers pulled away with 16 consecutive points, seven by Simmons, that made  the score 66-42 with 13:43 to play. Manhattan dropped to 9-13 and 5-6.  </P> <P> No. 16 Georgia Tech 94, No. 15 Louisville 84 -- Kenny Anderson scored four  points and had four assists in a 17-7 run to open the second half as the  visiting Yellow Jackets remained unbeaten outside the Atlantic Coast  Conference.  </P> <P> Georgia Tech (16-4) made 21 of 29 field goals in the second half (72%), after  hitting only 14 of 34 (41%) in the first half.  </P> <P> Dennis Scott led Georgia Tech with 30 points and Anderson finished with 29  points, 12 assists and eight rebounds. LaBradford Smith scored 23 points for  Louisville (18-5).  </P> <P> No. 23 Michigan State 84, Ohio State 75 -- Steve Smith scored 25 points and  Kirk Manns 24 as the Spartans hit seven consecutive field goals down the  stretch in a Big Ten Conference game at Columbus, Ohio.  </P> <P> Michigan State (19-5, 8-3) made 14 of 23 shots from the field in the second  half and finished 28 of 53 for 53%.  </P> <P> Ohio State, led by Mark Baker's 19 points, fell to 11-10 and 5-6.  </P> <P> No. 24 St. John's 83, Villanova 69 -- Boo Harvey scored 27 points for the  Redmen, who have won two consecutive games after losing three in a row.  </P> <P> Malik Sealy added 22 points for St. John's (19-6, 7-4), which has a solid grip  on fourth place in the Big East after the home victory.

Connecticut owned the Big East  single-game record with 113 points against Seton Hall in 1982. The 219 combined  points scored also was a league record.

The Drake players boycotted practice for  two days, then said they no longer would play for Abatemarco, complaining he  was too harsh with them.  </P> <P> Wisconsin 80, Iowa 71 -- Larry Hisle, Jr., and Brian Good, two low-scoring  guards, combined for 34 points as the Badgers ended a 15-game losing streak in  Iowa City, Iowa.  </P> <P> Wisconsin, which shot 77% from the field in the first half, is 12-12 and 3-9 in  the Big Ten.

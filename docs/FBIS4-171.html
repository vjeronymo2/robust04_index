			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Johannesburg SUNDAY TIMES in English on  3 April on page 8 carries a full-page advertisement for the  Democratic Party. The top two-thirds of the page contains a  picture of a white hand sticking out of a trench and waving a  white flag. The caption of the picture reads: "WHEN IT COMES TO  EFFECTIVE OPPOSITION, THE NATS HAVE SHOWN THEIR TRUE COLOURS."    Below the picture and caption is the following text:    "We all know the ANC are going to win the election. If  you're  worried what they'll do when they get in, you'll be looking for  an effective opposition party. And you really have only two  choices -- the DP [Democratic Party] or the NP [National Party].    "As you know, the NP are real flag-waving South Africans.    "Unfortunately, those flags are white ones.    "They surrendered to the ANC on the issue of Federalism, so  we're faced with an election boycott and possible civil war.  They surrendered on the issue of the Constitutional Court, so  the ANC nearly put their own judges into the highest courts (the  DP only stopped this happening at the last minute). And when  the Nats aren't giving in to the ANC, they're making deals with  them: they've released over 10,000 convicted criminals onto the  streets in secret amnesty deals, and they could release still  more.    "The implications for you are serious.    "If you don't have an effective opposition in Parliament,  you  won't have anybody to protect you if the new government goes  wrong. So vote for a party which won 5 times more issues at  negotiations than the Nats.    "Vote for the Democratic Party.    "We might be smaller, but we'll never surrender.    "DEMOCRATIC PARTY. PROTECTING YOU FROM THE ABUSE OF POWER.    "JOIN THE GROWING NUMBER OF PEOPLE MOVING ACROSS TO THE DP,  WRITE TO BOX 1475 CAPE TOWN 8000 FOR MORE INFORMATION."</p>

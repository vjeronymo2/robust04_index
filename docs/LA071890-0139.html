			<p><P> July 18, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WELLS FARGO GAINS STRENGTH IN SOUTHLAND;  </P> <P> BANKING: THE PURCHASE OF GREAT AMERICAN BANK'S 130 BRANCH OFFICES WOULD MAKE  THE STATE'S OLDEST LENDER NO. 1 IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY.  </P> <P> A year ago, Wells Fargo &amp; Co. Chairman and Chief Executive Carl E.  Reichardt put the banking industry on alert that his company would consider  buying thrifts to beef up its relatively small presence in Southern California.  </P> <P> With its planned $492-million purchase of the California branch network of  Great American Bank, a troubled but well-known savings institution in San  Diego, Wells would quickly zoom to first from seventh place among banks and  thrifts in fast-growing San Diego County.  </P> <P> Its market share of deposits there would quadruple, to 16%, surpassing the 7%  or so of both Security Pacific National Bank and Bank of America.  </P> <P> For 138-year-old Wells Fargo, California's oldest bank, the purchase is the  latest example of its dramatic shift from its historical stance as a bank  primarily for Northern California. It also signifies the growing dominance of  much more populous Southern California as a market for banking services.  </P> <P> The deal also underscores Wells' strategy of sticking to its bread-and-butter  home turf of California for expansion, rather than growing into other states or  countries. Rivals Security Pacific and Bank of America also have been expanding  their California branch networks but are making acquisitions elsewhere as well.  </P> <P> William Zuendt, vice chairman for retail banking for Wells, said he views the  deal as possibly more significant than Wells' 1986 purchase of Crocker National  Bank, which doubled the bank's presence in Southern California.  </P> <P> "This acquisition accomplishes more important growth than Crocker," Zuendt said  Tuesday after the Great American deal was announced. "We will be first in San  Diego and (essentially) tied in Orange County" with Bank of America and  Security Pacific.  </P> <P> In the last two decades, Wells has slowly built its presence in the Southland  by opening branches and buying other institutions.  </P> <P> Early this year, Wells completed purchases of the seven-branch Torrey Pines  Bank in Solana Beach, San Diego County; American National Bank, with 28  branches in the Central Valley, and the seven-office Valley National Bank,  based in Glendale.  </P> <P> Great American Bank's 130 California branch offices under familiar blue slate  roofs would give Wells Fargo a strong franchise and enable it quickly to pump  up its presence in Orange and Riverside counties. Great American has branches  as far north as Sonoma County, but most are in Southern California.  </P> <P> "It's a good way to get market share in a hurry," said Michael Abrahams, a  banking industry analyst with the investment firm of Bateman Eichler, Hill  Richards in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> This almost certainly won't be Wells' last purchase, according to Zuendt.  "Wells is obviously interested in acquiring good franchises," he said.  </P> <P> Although Security Pacific is launching a nationwide expansion bid, it recently  purchased financial institutions in San Diego, La Jolla and Valencia. It also  bought the 83-office California network of Gibraltar Savings.  </P> <P> "We're looking for good-quality acquisitions at the right price," said Terry  Perucca, senior vice president for corporate planning and acquisitions at  Security Pacific.  </P> <P> Bank of America, with a powerful retail banking network of 857 branches  throughout California, recently bought four branches of First Federal Savings  &amp; Loan in Bakersfield but consolidated three of those into its existing  seven offices in the area, for a net gain of one.  </P> <P> Bank of America also is still shopping. "We continue to review operations in  other Western states and California as well," said spokesman John Keane.  </P> <P> </P> <P> LEADING CALIFORNIA BANKS AND S&amp;Ls  </P> <P> Based on deposits as

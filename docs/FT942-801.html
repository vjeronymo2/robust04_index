			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Fresh US healthcare compromise: Senate works on latest draft that would cover 95% of population by 2000 The US Senate finance committee yesterday began work on a possible compromise bill on healthcare reform, as arguments swirled over what level of coverage would meet President Bill Clinton's demand for a universal health system. Mr Clinton has already dismissed as inadequate proposals that would have covered only 91 per cent of the population, but the White House yesterday withheld its fire from a new draft prepared by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, chairman of the Senate finance committee, that would set a target of taking care of 95 per cent of the population by the year 2000. Mr Moynihan was due to present his draft to the committee in a closed session yesterday afternoon, amid a mounting sense of alarm in Washington that time is running out for completing a bill before Congress breaks up. Like proposals floated by some moderate Republicans and conservative Democrats, the Moynihan plan would eliminate one of the most important but also most controversial components of Mr Clinton's comprehensive reform: the requirement that employers provide health insurance to all of their workers and pay for 80 per cent of its cost. This employer mandate is flatly rejected by almost all Republicans, making it virtually impossible to pass, at least in the Senate, where procedural rules allow a minority to block any action. The alternative of obliging individuals to buy health insurance, just as they must buy car insurance, arouses little enthusiasm among Republicans; many can already imagine the slogans in this autumn's election campaign: 'We wanted to make your employer provide you with health insurance, but the Republicans wanted you to pay instead.' Mr Moynihan's draft would avoid both employer and individual mandates, and instead rely on incentives to companies which do provide insurance to their workers. Low wage businesses that pay 80 per cent of their employees' health costs would receive cash subsidies from the government, while small companies paying at least 50 per cent of their employees' costs would be eligible to enrol in the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program, a flexible and generally well-regarded scheme which currently covers most government workers. This programme offers federal employees a menu of different private sector health plans, with an 'open season' once a year in which they can switch from one plan to another. In order to finesse Mr Clinton's demand for universal coverage, Mr Moynihan would establish a National Health Care Commission if 95 per cent of the population does not have insurance by the year 2000. Congress would be required to act by a specified deadline on the commission's recommendations, which would take effect automatically if Congress did nothing. Mr Moynihan's scheme is similar in many respects to a plan drafted by a group of centrist Republicans and Democrats on the finance committee, and it was welcomed by Senator John Chafee, one of the authors of that plan and one of the principal Republican spokesmen on healthcare. White House officials yesterday welcomed the Moynihan proposals as a sign of progress, and pointedly refrained from criticising its goal of 95 per cent coverage. 'We didn't put a number on it. Universal is a plan that covers everybody,' said Ms Dee Dee Myers, the White House press secretary.</p>

			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / Germany ready to defy EU on telecom liberalisation Germany may allow new telecommunications companies to open their own networks by the end of 1997, despite strong opposition from state-owned Deutsche Telekom and national operators in other European Union countries. In a surprise about-turn, Mr Wolfgang Botsch, post office minister, said Bonn would consider going it alone if the EU's council of ministers failed to fix a date for liberalising all EU networks by the end of this year. A report earlier this year by the EU's Bangemann group on the development of 'information superhighway' services said competition in the provision of networks was essential to Europe's future competitiveness with the US and Japan. The Commission is currently drafting proposals, to be published early next year, which would open telecoms network infrastructure to competition at the same time as telecoms services. Basic phone services are set to be opened to competition in January 1998 across most of the EU. That would also become the date for infrastructure competition if EU ministers support the Commission. A Commission official said Mr Botsch's statement was an 'important first step' towards persuading vested interests - notably state-owned telecoms companies - to accept the inevitability of early infrastructure competition. Mr Botsch, who had previously insisted the 12 EU states should move together and grant open access to networks one or two years after the 1998 services deadline, said Deutsche Telekom needed to be able to plan clearly. Although accepting that other member states would be defensive, he was now inclined to give up both monopolies simultaneously, he told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. However, the move is still strongly opposed by Deutsche Telekom, which is preoccupied with the privatisation of the company due to start in early 1996. Mr Rolf-Dieter Leister, chairman of Deutsche Telekom's supervisory board, told the Suddeutsche Zeitung: 'I certainly do not represent the view that Germany should become the front-runner in European telecoms liberalisation.' Mr Leister, Telekom's most senior non-executive, made plain that Telekom management, preparing for the transition to a joint stock company next January, was hampered by the need for all important decisions to be approved at the political level. Telekom's mandate had to be made clear now for the benefit of future shareholders, he said. It was especially important that the enterprise should be able to establish foreign subsidiaries and appoint top managers without Mr Botsch's having the final say. Meanwhile management needed to be clear on the scope and timing of domestic liberalisation moves: 'Will the minister license corporate networks? How will he deal with alternative networks? What will happen with broad-band cable? How will mobile telephones develop in future?' he asked. Telekom is especially anxious about pressure on the minister from power utilities who want licences to start using their internal systems in 1996 to offer data transmission services to the public and other industries, effectively breaching Telekom's network monopoly. The UK has allowed competition in telecoms infrastructure for a decade, and the Netherlands is set to follow suit following the partial privatisation of its state operator earlier this year.</p>

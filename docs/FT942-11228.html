			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Healthcall flotation price tag reduced to Pounds 58m The flotation value of Healthcall, the doctors' deputising service, has been cut to Pounds 58m from initial estimates of Pounds 70m as the new issues market continues to cool. The company is issuing fewer new shares than expected and the price is more than 10 per cent lower than hoped for last month. Mr Maurice Henchey, chief executive, said: 'Institutions liked the company, but they have been inundated with new issues. In the circumstances we did remarkably well.' He added that, with few existing shareholders selling, 'the most important thing was to allow a lot of scope in the after-market'. He said pricing had not been affected by expected government moves to reduce the out-of-hours burden on family doctors. The shares have been priced at 105p, equivalent to 14.9 times last year's earnings from the group's continued healthcare operations. The notional yield at the issue price is 4.8 per cent. Shares valued at Pounds 31m are being placed with institutions by Morgan Grenfell, of which Pounds 7.8m can be clawed back via an intermediaries offer. Applications must be received by James Capel, the stockbroker, by next Thursday, with dealings due to start on May 18. COMMENT The last minute price cut should help the shares get off to a good start, but there are some question marks over the long-term growth prospects of the core business. Healthcall already has almost half the potential duty doctor market, which has been growing strongly over the past few years. More recently, revenue has been boosted by flu epidemics and rate increases. However, the government is keen to stem the rising bill for out-of-hours calls, a fair proportion of which could be dealt with more cheaply at 24-hour health centres. Healthcall already has five such pilot centres, but a big shift away from home visits could require significant capital investment with uncertain returns. The group is well-placed to capitalise on the trend towards community-based care and has moved into new areas such as eye-care services for residential homes. But these are currently too small to offset any significant slow-down in the core business.</p>

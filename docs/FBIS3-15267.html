"This is the basis for continuing reform, an end to the  crisis through economic restructuring and creating conditions  for economic, political and social stabilisation", Chernomyrdin  said.    "We see no ground and no possibility for radical changes in  the course we are pursuing. The government will take guidance  from the programme adopted last August and approved by the  president. We shall stick to this programme and implement it no  matter how difficult it may be," Chernomyrdin said in the  meeting with ministers, leaders of state committees and other  federal executive bodies, parliament chamber speakers, faction  leaders and heads of local governments, as well as the leaders  of interregional associations and public organisations, which is  being held in the Kremlin to discuss the state and prospects for  the development of the Russian national economy and road safety  law," Chernomyrdin said.    The Russian Government is satisfied with neither the speed  nor intensivity of reforms, nor is it satisfied with the quality  of the work being done by management bodies on all levels, from  the federal to the local. The government in full shares the  president's alarm and the society's worries about the country's  economic position, Viktor Chernomyrdin stressed.    However, he noted, there are no foundations for the drawing  of hasty conclusions that a catastrophe is iminent or that  reforms have stopped and it is necessary to turn back to 1992 in  order to "renew" radical restructuring. It is permissible and  necessary to argue about what has and has not been done and why.  But it is not permissible to overlook the obvious: a market  economy already exists in Russia. Now, the premier considers,  the country needs to move on, taking into account the  fundamental differences in the economic and political situation  which has formed at the beginning of 1994, and paying attention  to the lessons contained in the government's mistakes and  programmes.    Summing up the year 1993, Chernomyrdin noted that the  country  was able to undertake significant steps towards the furthering  of reforms despite the difficult internal political situation.  The reasonably strict financial and monetary policy made it  possible to control, and towards the end of the year, seriously  lower the rate of inflation. Privatisation was carried out  dynamically, and additional measures were taken to liberalize  Russia's foreign economic activities.    Nevertheless, the country's economic situation remains  alarming. The decline in industrial production grew towards the  end of the year. We have stepped right up to the line, beyond  which lies the irreversible destruction of our scientific and  technical potential. The country's external economic position  likewise remains tense. The problem of non-payments has again  became more acute.    According to Viktor Chernomyrdin, Russia's budget was not  able to fully pay for the goods produced for government needs or  for several other obligations, including the payment of salaries  in the budget sphere. Instead of searching for additional ways  to strengthen the income base and rationalize expenses,  "emergency" measures were undertaken.    Talk about the destructive effects of nonpayments on the  financial status of enterprises, the budget, and the country as  a whole has been going on for more than a year. In the end,  there is still no full and operational account of mutual debts  in the national economy. This problem is undoubtedly very  complex, but, the premier stressed, at times the impression is  produced that neither the Finance Ministry, the Economics  Ministry, the State Property Committee, nor the Central Bank of  Russia wants to deal with the issue. In the meantime, the  situation is getting more complex every day.    Speaking about the trade ministries and departments, Viktor  Chernomyrdin emphasized that it sometimes seems that their main  goal is to wring more money and privileges for their  enterprises, as though state policy and the government's  realistic capabilities do not concern them.    Last fall, an action plan was adopted for the implementation  of the first stage of the government programme. An analysis of  the plan showed that of 88 assignments, only one half were  actually carried out. Principally important decisions have not  been put into practice, such as decisions on agricultural  co-operative societies, on the develepment of agricultural loans  and insurance, and the practical use of mortgages.    Viktor Chernomyrdin expressed his opinion that ministry and  department heads must look at the economy as a whole and carry  out truly national policies. However, he stressed, far from all  of these heads have been able to withstand the pressure from  special interest lobbies, especially when these attacks were  accompanied by a lot of noise, which contained political  implications as well. In what kind of state, the premier asked  rhetorically, are possible instances where electricity is turned  off not only for television programmes, but even for civil  flight monitoring. "democracy or no democracy, we will react to  such things in the future very severely", Viktor Chernomyrdin  noted.    The premier expressed his confidence that it is impossible  to  carry out reforms looking at the country and the people from the  top down, without explaining anything or asking for the  agreement of those, for whose sake the government is working.    Summarizing not only 1993, but the past two years connected  with reforms, Viktor Chernomyrdin emphasized that, "it is  necessary for us to first of all look at the new problems which  the Russian economy is facing today".    First of all, he noted, there is a new situation regarding  prices. Internal prices for the majority of goods and services  (excluding energy sources), have approached world levels. This,  on the one hand, has contributed to the saturation of the  market, the unhindered establishment of new economic ties, and  the development of trade and normal market relations. But, on  the other hand, more and more enterprises have been exposed as  unprofitable, ineffective, and incompetitive.    Second, the reasonably strict financial and monetary-credit  policy has nevertheless brought certain benefits, although it  was not able to stop inflation. The inflation rate, if one does  not count january 1994, has noticeably decreased. It will be no  more than 13-15 per cent in february, meaning, it will remain on  the same level as the November-December, 1994 period. However,  Viktor Chernomyrdin pointed out, the government is worried by  the asymmetric reactions of the national economy to strict  monetary policies: on the one hand, the increase in the money  supply gives inflation a strong push, but, notwithstanding  expectations, has not led to the stabilisation of production,  and holds back the much-needed proccesses of essential  restructuring in the production sphere.    At the same time, he noted, the lowering of the rate of  increase of the money supply, without significantly effecting  the level of prices, causes a sharp fall in production and  increases enterprises' financial problems. This in particular  is the result we have gotten from the tight control held over  the money supply in the June-October, 1993 period.    Third, the premier said, the production decline in 1993 and  the first months of this year has turned out to be more than was  expected. Effectiveness is falling, we are faced with the  threat of massive unemployment and the reduction of the means of  production. In several sectors, the current level of production  is no more than 50 per cent of the january, 1990 level.    The crisis has reached not only those sectors for which a  large decline in production was predicted, but also those who  produce competitve goods. In such conditions, the premier  pointed out, it is obvious that the question goes deeper than  the "more money, less money" level. Without a fairly strict  financial and monetary policy, it will be impossible to do  anything.    While we will not at all costs weaken efforts in the sphere  of financial stabilisation, Viktor Chernomyrdin noted, we must  act on the other aspects of russia's economic life no less  decisively.    The answer, according to the government's opinion, lies in  the solution of the following tasks: the strengthening of state  power and the introduction of order into all areas of the  economy and social life; the implementation of a balanced,  reasonably strict financial policy; the decisive activation of  the structural investment policy; significant changes in  privatisation policy to aim it at not just transferring state  property, but at improving the effectivene of production, at  stimulating investments, and at the activation of basic  restructuring; the use of all possibilities for the  strengtheningof social policy to make reforms answer the  people's needs and to neutralize the basic sources of  dissatisfaction among the people; the consolidation of all the  healthy forces in society to resolve the tasks of the new stage  in refroms and to achieve national accord on that platform.    A special concern of the government remains the  strengthening  of the legal guarantees of market reforms, in connection with  which the Cabinet of Ministers has sent the State Duma more than  60 bills.    Turning to the problems faced by the agricultulral sector,  the prime minister admitted that, "subsidies to agricultural  producers are necessary, but now they are a burden on the budget  and often ineffective". At the same time, he emphasized that  agricultural subsidies create a threat to the other sectors of  the economy.    Viktor Chernomyrdin refuted press reports alleging that he  is  planning to give the farmers 34 trillion roubles in credits.  "There is no such plan, and there will not be", he announced.  Support of the agrarian sector will remain at the same level in  1994 as it was at in 1993, and money will be handed out only  when results are guaranteed and the purpose is completely clear,  the head of the Cabinet of Ministers assured.    Then Chernomyrdin turned to the tasks which demand solutions  in the next two or three months. The most important is the  "creation of a mechanism for the resolution of the mutual  non-payments problem in the national economy". Several means of  battling this problem were named, including the compulsive  registration and calculation of all the accounts of a given  enterprise, including its foreign accounts, and stricter  administrative and financial responsibility for the concealment  of income sources. The introduction of a practical bankruptcy  mechanism for those enterprises which cannot pay their debts is  also envisaged.    The premier expressed his opinion that the economic  situation  requires "the decisive strengthening of the effectiveness of  financial policy: we cannot afford the luxury of living a second  year without an approved budget".    As work on the draft budget for 1994 is being wrapped up,  the  main task remains that of not allowing the budget deficit to  grow. However, Viktor Chernomyrdin named a different figure  approximating inflation at the end of the year than President  Yeltsin did in his introductory address. While Boris Yeltsin  named an orientation figure of 5 per cent, the premier brought  forward 7-9 per cent. In doing so, Viktor Chernomyrdin hedged  his words by saying that the government intends to conduct an  active search for reserves, "which would allow us to  consistently approach the 3-5 orientation figure for inflation  at the end of the year, which was mentioned in the president's  address".    Financial stabilisation is impossible to achieve without an  effective tax system, the speaker declared. Among its top  priority jobs, the government is bent on simplifying and  organizing the tax collection procedure, refusing enterprises  and districts in their requests for individual privileges, and  strengthening the tax collection service. At the same time as  these measures are being carried out, the tax regulations will  be perfected.    Reporting that the federal budget in 1993 did not recieve  7.5  trillion roubles, or about 30 per cent of the income which it  had forecast for itself, Chernomyrdin demanded that the internal  revenue personnel, which number 135 thousand, improve the  effectiveness of their work.    Viktor Chernomyrdin paid special attention to the  fundamental  reorganization of mutual budget relations between the center and  the regions. At the base of the new system of budget federalism  will lie common rules on the allocation of state expenditure and  income between the federal budget and the budgets of the Russian  Federation's many component parts. The main principles and  purposes of the budget relations reform were defined in the  president's state-of-the-federation address and his order from  December 23, 1993.    The 1994 budget will be based on the actual state of  affairs.  "Our choice is fairly limited", the premier noted, "if we let  inflation have its head, we will end up in a spiral fall which  we will not be able to get out of. If we stop production, we  will end up with a seething country, collapse, and chaos.  Today's most important question is to walk literally along the  edge of a razor, without falling to one side or the other".    Structural investment policy was named as one of the  priorities of economic reform. Chernomyrdin noted that the  government is going to adopt a radical re-allocation of budget  means, increasing the amount of government investments. They  should amount to three per cent of the gross national product.  Three-quarters of the over-all budget means ear-marked for  capital investments are proposed to transfer to the financing of  the construction of federally-important projects envisaged in  current government programmes.    Taking this into account, the government is correcting its  investment programme for 1994. Of the 86 federal programmes  which have already been approved and presented to the  government, about 40 will be implemented. The mechanism of  extending subsidies and credits is also being reviewed. Their  share as a percentage of all budget allocations will be lowered  from 9 per cent to 7.4 per cent.    The government is beginning to get tough on ineffective  businesses, many of which will have to be shut down. Along with  these steps, the government will assist the implementation of  large-scale investment projects which have importance for the  future of the Russian economy and are being carried out with the  help of foreign capital.    According to Chernomyrdin, government money will bring the  most profit if it is allocated on a commercial basis through  banks and other financial institutions.    The government head urged entrepreneurs, bankers, and the  heads of large joint stock companies to increase their  participation in investment projects and attract more capital to  the Russian market.    Chernomyrdin called privatization one of the most important  methods of fundamentally restructuring the economy. He noted  that the voucher privatization programme must be finished by the  first of July. A new stage in the government's privatization  policy is due to begin in the second half of this year. Its  basic form will be commercial and investment competitions with  strict regulations which are to ensure the reorganization and  restructuring of enterprises and the inflow of investments,  including from abroad. In 1994 privatization should become a  sort of locomotive of reforms on the local level.    Viktor Chernomyrdin called social policy the weakest part of  the government's work. The government has recently been working  hard on the formation of a more active social policy. First of  all, direct aid to the needy will be increased and and the  financial base of the corresponding funds will be reinforced.    From April first, the amount paid out in existing pensions  will be recalculated. The next step will be a new pension law,  the draft of which will be presented for discussion to the  Federal Assembly.    Speaking about the gradual restoration of citizens' savings,  Viktor Chernomyrdin stressed that this will be done first of all  for veterans. Part of their savings will be restored by the  transfer of pieces of state property, such as stocks in state  enterprises or land.    The premier judged that unemployment has begun to make  itself  felt. Open unemployment is still not very large, but already  almost four million people are being forced to work on a  part-time basis. He said it is now necessary to think about the  organization of social projects, such as the construction of  living accomodations, roads, bridges, and other socially  important things.    Touching upon the question of the activation of income  policy, Chernomyrdin stressed, "we are going to begin a stricter  progressive tax policy on high and extra-high incomes, require  the declaration of incomes when making large purchases, and  change the real estate tax policy". The regulations concerning  enterprises' expenditure on wages are also changing, he said.  One more step will be the introduction by the government of an  official minimum living standard, to which will be tied the  minimal wage and minimal pensions.    Chernomyrdin called the sharp increase in housing a  nation-wide task. He reported that the government has already  adopted a packet of regulations on the development of the credit  system in the housing sphere and on subsidies for the  construction and purchase of living quarters. The subsidies  would go to those who have been waiting in state lines for  years, military personnel, and other "privileged people".  Non-budget ways of financing housing construction are also to  be developed.    Chernomyrdin admitted that the government cannot afford to  give the sciences, education, and culture all the finances from  the federal budget which these spheres deserve. The science and  higher education systems cannot survive without rationalising  their activities, wisely redistributing their resources, and  getting rid of extra organizations.    The premier said the government is worried about the battle  against crime. He reported that there are still very few  concrete, effective measures which would decrease the tension  around the growing threats to society and peoples' safety. The  government is determined to undertake severe steps towards  freeing state structures from the influence of mafia elements,  organized crime, and corrupt people, no matter what position the  suspect holds.    As far as the political aspects of Russian society's life  go,  Chernomyrdin expressed his hope that the political amnesty will  "all the same become a step towards reconciliation and not  towards a new round of confrontation and destabilization". "The  president and government will act as sure guarantors so that  events do not take such a turn", the prime minister announced.    Chernomyrdin sharply condemned exaggerated rumours about his  presidential aspirations. "I am not one of those handymen who  are ready to go right from manager to minister and then to  president", he said. He considers it "unethical to carry on any  conversations on the presidential theme while the current  president is still functioning".    In his conclusion, Viktor Chernomyrdin called for all the  branches of power to reach an agreement, which would be helped  by the new constitution and the basic conceptions of national  security as expressed in the president's address. Russia has a  parliament and a government, and it has, finally, the general  desire of its peoples to restore their country to its status as  a great, powerful, and prosperous state, the head of the Cabinet  of Ministers emphasized.</p>

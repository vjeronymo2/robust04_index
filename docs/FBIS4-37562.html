			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Al-'Attas Tells AL-HAYAH: Dialogue </F> Is Impossible Before Cease-Fire and Disengagement of Forces"]    [Text] London, AL-HAYAH -- Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, prime  minister of the Democratic Republic of Yemen [DRY], has denied  the statements made by Yemeni Planning Minister Dr.  'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani about Gulf states' intervention in the  Yemeni conflict and their supply of arms to Aden. Al-'Attas  hailed the results of his visit to Saudi Arabia, concluded  yesterday. He said: "On the two visits I recently made to  Saudi Arabia I found the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King  Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz and all the brother Saudi officials very  understanding. I can say that on this visit I am more  optimistic about the future." Praising the Saudi position, he  said: "The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia stands with all its  capabilities [willing] to help our people in their current  plight." He expressed the southern leadership's readiness for  dialogue, but after a cease-fire and the disengagement of  forces. He affirmed his rejection of the revivial of the  military committee formed before the war broke out.    He urged regional and international organizations "to  quickly  provide urgent humanitarian aid for the Yemeni people in the  Aden Governorate and surrounding governorates which are  suffering from an acute shortage of medical supplies, food, and  services as a result of the continuous shelling by the north  Yemeni forces."    He called on the military command in Sanaa to "submit to the  resolutions of the international community and to international  legitimacy by stopping the fighting and implementing Security  Council resolution 924." He stressed the need for  "international forces to separate the warring forces if Sanaa  does not comply with the Security Council resolution." He  reaffirmed the unity of the south Yemeni leadership, the Yemeni  Socialist Party [YSP] leadership, and their alliance with the  patriotic forces in the south."    He said that "the Sanaa regime has, since the beginning of  unity, tried to divide the southern leadership and the YSP  leadership. It failed in the past and it will fail now and in  the future." He noted in this connection that "perhaps there  are some people or some individuals with special circumstances,  and, because of these circumstances, they take certain stands  with the Sanaa regime."    On the question of international recogntion of the DRY,  al-'Attas said: "Our efforts are geared to stopping the war  first. There is great sympathy with our efforts. That sympathy  reflects recognition of the reality imposed by the circumstances  of the war. After a cease-fire is achieved and consolidated we  will turn to the international matter of recognition." He also  spoke about the "sympathy of some Arab states with Sanaa." He  said that "some very few states sympathize with the other side  without knowing the real situation. Some of them perhaps take  that attitude because of special circumstances relating to them,  but one day they will know the truth and will take the position  they should be taking."    He expressed "satisfaction" with the U.S. position on the  Yemeni war. He said that "the U.S. position is balanced and  does not at all condone this war. It is against this war and  does not approve of the imposition of unity by force. We are in  contact with the United States and are explaining our views  continuously. We believe that the U.S. position is balanced and  helps toward the achievement of results that would, first and  foremost, stop this war and consolidate the cease-fire so that  we could move to the next phase, which is dialogue concerning  the political situation in Yemen. That cause also concerns us,  and we are ready for that phase which should come after the  cease-fire, its consolidation, the cessation of the war, and the  disengagement of the warring forces. Then we would be able to  have an open-minded dialogue on the political situation,  solutions, and ways out. [no closing quotation mark] Referring  to his meeting in Jeddah with [the UN secretary general's envoy]  Lakhdar Brahimi last Thursday evening, he said: "We resumed  discussion of his mission based on our meetings with him in  al-Mukalla last week. Brahimi had conveyed to us a proposal  from the brothers in Sanaa regarding a military committee to  supervise the cease-fire, but that proposal referred to an old  committee formed before the war. It is clear that the war  torpedoed all the insitutions which existed before and created a  new situation. That is why we expressed complete willingness to  search for an appropriate mechanism for the consolidation of the  cease-fire and the monitoring of any violations which might  occur, and that is in accordance with UN Security Council  resolution 924. We explained to brother Lakhdar Brahimi our  position, which included the following points:    "1. Willingness to discuss, with whoever is assigned by  Sanaa, this matter...of finding a mechanism for the observance  and consolidation of the cease-fire, provided the meeting is  held in Cairo.    "2. That team (to discuss the cease-fire) should be formed  in  the context of implementation of Security Council resolution 924.    "3. The meeting of representatives of the south and  representatives of the north should be held under the  chairmanship or the supervision of Brother Lakhdar Brahimi,  envoy of the UN secretary general.    "4. The meeting to be held in Cairo should be preceded by an  effective cease-fire.    "We gave brother Lakhdar Brahimi the names of our  representatives for that meeting. They are: Brother Muhsin  Muhammad Bin-Farid, Brother Qasim 'Abd-al-Rabb, and Brother  'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Bakri. We await the reply of the brothers in  Sanaa."    He reaffirmed that the military committee was invalid at the  present time. He said: "The old military committee is invalid.  It was formed in certain circumstances before the war, and it  was formed by an administrative decision and included brothers  from some Arab states, that is from Jordan and Oman in addition  to the U.S. and French military attaches, but the new  developments and the war situation require something else."    He added: "We do not object to the old committee being part  of the new committee to be formed, but the circle of  participation must be enlarged to include the Arab League, the  United Nations, and other states. We suggest participation of  the rest of the Security Council members in the committee, and  we suggest that a team of observers from states to be agreed on  be attached to that committee. So, we are in favor of having  this new committee, to be the new mechanism for the  implementation of the Security Council resolution and to be  attached to the representative of the UN secretary general."</p>

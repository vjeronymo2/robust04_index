			<p>BFN     [Text] San Jose, 14 May (ACAN - EFE) -- A violent clash  between police and workers of the Geest Caribbean banana company  in Sarapiqui, 130 km north of San Jose, left over 35 people  injured on 13 May. Strikers threw stones at policemen, injuring  16 of them. The police returned fire and wounded 19 workers,  three of them seriously. The police also arrested 33 workers in  the clash, which began when they evicted the workers from the  farms where they had been on strike for a week.    Approximately 1,000 Geest Caribbean company workers were  preventing the police from clearing roadblocks on the roads  leading to the banana farms. The workers hurled rocks to repel  the police's attack, who returned fire with guns and tear gas.    Security Minister Juan Diego Castro justified the police  action and said he gave the workers a deadline to lift the  roadblocks before the police would evict them, but "all efforts  to convince them were in vain." A correspondent for the daily  LA NACION, who witnessed the incident, said 150 workers clashed  with approximately 200 riot police "marching in closed formation  toward a roadblock erected by the workers."    "The police loaded their M-16 rifles and got the tear gas  grenades ready while the strikers awaited the troop's advance,  rubbing together in their hands the stones they would later hurl  at the police, the daily reported. [no closing quotation mark as  received]    Union spokesman Jorge Barboza told ACAN-EFE that the labor  unrest at Geest Caribbean began in April when the company cut  wages up to 50 percent in some cases and then dismissed over 200  workers of the Union of Agricultural, Livestock, and Related  Trades Workers of Heredia (Sitagah), a union the company does  not recognize. Barboza added that the strike, which has entered  its eighth day, is intended to recover wages and achieve the  reinstatement of 200 workers fired by the company, "which was  preparing to dismiss a similar number of union workers."    The Geest Caribbean company issued a communique stating that  "the strike is an unjust protest" and explained that it does not  recognize Sitagah, which heads the strike, "since it is not a  registered union, therefore the company cannot negotiate with  people who do not represent the interests of Geest workers."  The company granted the workers' representation to an  association of blue-and white-collar workers, which, according  to the communique "groups 65 percent of the company's workers."    Barboza said "the workers have decided that the union will  represent them, and the company must accept that decision." He  also announced that they are preparing, with support from the  International Labor Organization, a labor rights violation  complaint. Barboza noted that all the dismissed workers belong  to Sitagah and said the company intents to "rid" itself of  unionized personnel. He added that the workers are ready to  negotiate a solution to the conflict.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cape Town May 23 SAPA -- President Nelson Mandela on  Monday expressed his satisfaction following discussions on the  KwaZulu land transfer with the minister of home affairs, Chief  Mangosuthu Buthelezi. The two men met at Westbrooke, the  president's official residence, for about one-and-a-half hours.    "I am happy with the candid and harmonious manner in which  we  addressed this issue. We are discussing it as a very important  and sensitive issue. I'm sure that with the good relationship  between ourselves, we can address the matter to the satisfaction  of all," Mr Mandela said.    President Mandela said both he and Chief Buthelezi would now  refer the matter to their respective organisations for any  decision. "I am satisfied with the progress which we have made.  It now depends of our organisations," he said.    Chief Buthelezi said he had explained to Mr Mandela that the  land in question had been transferred to the KwaZulu government  three years ago. The government had then decided to transfer  the land to different Zulu tribes living in the area as communal  land. "There is nothing new in this. There is no hanky panky.  It is insulting to suggest that the land was given to the  king." He accused the media of "trying to drive a wedge between  the ANC and the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party]".    The two leaders also discussed the allocation of cabinet  portfolios to the IFP and the siting of the KwaZulu/Natal  provincial capital. Chief Buthelezi said the location of the  capital should be put to the people of the province in a  referendum.    He said the IFP accepted the fact that it would not get the  health portfolio as initially indicated. The ANC's Dr Nkosazana  Zuma has been appointed minister of health.    The chief, who was accompanied by deputy minister of  security  services Joe Matthews and Prince Gideon Zulu of the Zulu royal  house, responded angrily when a journalist asked whether the  land transfer may be repealed. "It seems to me you don't want  peace in South Africa," he said.</p>

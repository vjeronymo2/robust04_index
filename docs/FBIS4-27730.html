			<p>BFN     [Text] Information Minister Harmoko has stated that  President Suharto will not issue a presidential decree on  foreign investment in mass media although such investment is  permitted under Government Regulation No. 20/1994. Speaking to  reporters after meeting the president at Merdeka Palace this  afternoon, the information minister urged the general public to  stop making a fuss over the matter because the president's  policy is clear. Harmoko subsequently urged the general public  to stop questioning Government Regulation No. 20, particularly  the clause on possible foreign investment in mass media through  joint ventures.    He also informed the head of state of the indefinite  postponement of the Islamic Conference Organization information  ministers conference.</p>

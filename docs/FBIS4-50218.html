			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Gao Anming: "Ending Residence Registration"] </F>   [Text] The Chinese Government is expected to scrap the  36-year-old residence registration system next month so farmers  can live legally in small cities.    Han Jun, a researcher with the Institute of Rural  Development  under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said the plan will  open the gates of cities at and below the county level to  peasants who have been denied permanent urban residence since  the late 1950s.    China had 517 official cities by the end of 1992, 323 at the  county level. Above the county level were 191 prefectural level  cities and three municipalities. There were a total of 2,171  counties.    Han, who has been widely quoted in the Chinese press  recently  for his study of the household registration system, welcomed the  scheduled move as a breakthrough.    By the end of 1992, 78 per cent of the population, or 919  million Chinese citizens, were classified as rural residents.    Frustrated by low income from farming and few job  opportunities due to the dearth of arable land, some 50 to 60  million farmers have left their hometowns. At least half have  moved into cities despite the fact they have no legal status  there.    This has been possible because urban reforms have  increasingly commercialized employment, the supply of housing,  food and other basic commodities, as well as welfare and social  securities, which were distributed administratively in the past  under the traditional command economy.    The old system is no longer effective in holding back the  city-bound population flow following the disintegration of  "people's communes" and the compulsory government procurement of  all farm products.    Household registration has become detrimental to further  economic development, Han said in an interview with China Daily.    The scholar described farmers who have entered the cities as  "amphibians."    Not acknowledged by urban authorities as permanent  residents,  they are not permitted to take some city jobs. So to be safe,  they hold on to their contracted land at home, though they never  actually cultivate it.    A rural labourer is entitled to 0.31 hectares of land in the  countryside. Even with basic equipment, they can complete a  year's worth of farm work in a few months. This explains why  many have the time to look for jobs in cities.    However, as cities close their doors to rural workers, most  surplus rural labour is forced to seek jobs in the countryside  -- explaining why 80 per cent of China's rural non-agricultural  businesses are located in villages, whereas a mere 1 per cent  are in county seats and cities.    Scattered companies have caused inefficiency in land use and  infrastructure construction, difficulties in pollution treatment  and sluggish development of the tertiary industry.    The permanent residence system has also caused social  problems, Han said.    Transient rural labourers face problems in registering for  marriage, sending children to nurseries and schools, looking for  housing and buying social security.    They are also left in an administrative vacuum as they are  no  longer governed by the authorities of their hometowns. City  governments, on the other hand, do not regulate them either  because farmers do not have residence. As a result, the number  of crimes has risen sharply among transient workers in cities.  The percentage of criminal offences committed by transients has  nearly doubled to 41 per cent from 1990 to 1993 in Beijing. In  Shenzhen, cases involving transients jumped from 26 per cent of  total criminal cases in 1980 to 93 per cent last year.    Han said the reform will break the division between rural  and  urban residents and remove the various privileges those in the  city get so the two groups may be placed on a more equal footing.    Answering worries among urbanites, Han said the reform  should  not hurt them much if it is carried out step by step.    Farmers should not flood cities if the restrictions are  lifted, he said, as has been the case in Brazil, Mexico and  India. In Brazil, for example, most farmers have lost their  land to large landlords, who carry out farming with modern  machines. Farmers thus flock to cities to make a living.    In China, however, each farmer is entitled to a piece of  land  of largely the same size. Most of them would probably remain on  the land.    The expected commercialization of welfare and social  security  following the end of the residence system also would increase  the cost of moving to cities.    Han said the reform would invariably intensify employment  competition between urbanites and rural workers and increase  unemployment in some areas. But this should not be an excuse to  keep the mandatory registration system. Latest statistics show  that there are many more unemployed people in the countryside  than in cities.    Han noted that most transient labourers take up blue-collar  jobs shunned by their urban counterparts, such as selling  vegetables, making clothes and building houses. They are  helping city residents more than seizing opportunities from  them, and have created as many new jobs as they have taken, Han  said.    The rural population's lower educational standards also hurt  them in their job hunting efforts in the city.    To minimize the risks of the reform, the government should  establish a national market to regulate the labour flow and let  farmers know about the opportunities and risks in cities.    In cities, the hidden subsidies employees receive in medical  care and housing should be substituted with cash wages. At the  same time, a socialized welfalre and securities system open to  all residents should be introduced so that urban residence cards  do not mean additional benefits.    Han said the reform should begin in small cities because  most  privileges for city residents there have already been  eliminated, thus making the transition easier.    People who apply for permanent urban residence would be  required to transfer their land to others so that those still in  the countryside could be given larger plots.    New city recruits would no longer enjoy previous privileges,  and the government would encourage farmers to pool funds to  build cities of their own, Han said.</p>

			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Shanks &amp; McEwan Shareholders in Shanks &amp; McEwan need strong stomachs. The 1991 profits warning, around which revolved the recent insider dealing case involving Mr Thorold Mackie, put paid to the fancy rating - over 40 times historic earnings at the peak. Since then it has been downhill almost all the way. The company had underperformed the market by 30 per cent this year before yesterday's surprise announcement of provisions on the construction side. Since the shares barely flinched, though, one might reasonably wonder whether Shanks has bottomed. The Pounds 19m provision against a construction business which turned over Pounds 48m last year looks prudent. Since a good portion covers doubtful payments for public sector construction work, with the Scottish Office the ultimate customer, there must be a chance of write-backs in future years. Even so, it is questionable whether maintaining a presence in construction is worth the expense. If forecast profits before provisions of Pounds 29m last year survive the auditors' scrutiny, the waste side will have held up better. But waste management is far from being the recession-proof business touted at the end of the 1980s. With new government licensing arrangements again postponed, big landfill operators like Shanks will find it hard to raise prices immediately. A price earnings ratio close to the market average, even after the recent de-rating, demands no more nasty shocks on the downside and some pleasant surprises on the way up.</p>

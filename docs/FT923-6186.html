			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / Institute of Directors sees sharp fall in economic confidence CONFIDENCE IN Britain's economic prospects has plunged in the past two months, according to the Institute of Directors. The institute's latest survey of business opinion, published today, shows that only 13 per cent of company directors are more optimistic about the economy, against 50 per cent in response to the same question in June. But the institute says directors tend to be less gloomy about prospects for their own companies than for the whole economy. A third remain optimistic about the outlook for their businesses, while the number of companies doing badly is the lowest for 16 months. According to the 325 directors replying to the survey, two thirds of companies are doing well - a level that has been constant for 18 months. The institute concludes that the pattern reflects a crisis of confidence much more than of substance. Business volume and orders have remained steady this month while the upward trend in investment - concentrated on machinery and equipment - has continued. The institute says that the main concern among directors is insufficient demand for products, whereas cashflow had been identified as the biggest problem earlier in the summer - suggesting that a recovery might then have been under way. Mr Peter Morgan, director-general of the institute, said the survey 'shows a great gulf between, on the one hand, directors' perception of the economy and their business prospects and, on the other, the actual performance of their companies. 'What we have at present is stable business performance but at a low level of economic activity. The situation is fragile and a crisis of confidence could easily be translated into a real downturn.' The Finance and Leasing Association yesterday reported a 1 per cent increase during the second quarter of the year over the first quarter in consumer lending and business finance, David Barchard writes. However, the association said the rise in new consumer-sector lending was in line with the same period of 1991 and did not reflect a return of consumer confidence. Total consumer credit loans reached Pounds 16.9bn and total business finance sector lending Pounds 38.7bn. Motor vehicle finance dropped by 1.3 per cent to Pounds 11.6bn. New lending to the consumer sector rose by 5 per cent to Pounds 2.5bn, largely as a result of a 12 per cent rise in unsecured personal loans and a 9 per cent rise in borrowing on store cards.

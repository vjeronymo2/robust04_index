			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FLORES SEEKS TO CLOSE SCRAP YARD  </P> <P> Los Angeles Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores has asked city zoning officials to  consider declaring a San Pedro scrap yard a nuisance and eventually move for  its closure, unless steps are taken to reduce noise, traffic and debris.  </P> <P> In a letter to Zoning Administrator Bob Janovici, Flores said the action  against Hiuka America Corp. follows four years of complaints about its  operations from community residents and business leaders. The 20-acre yard,  which opened in 1986, is at 2100 N. Gaffey St., just off the Harbor Freeway.  </P> <P> Flores' action follows months of talks with company officials, who have argued  that Hiuka has done all it can to reduce noise, traffic and other effects,  while searching for a more suitable location.  </P></p>

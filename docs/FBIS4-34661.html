			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Zenaida Costales for the "National Radio News"] </F>   [Text] For over 34 years, Cubans have witnessed the U.S.  increased encouragement of illegal emigrations. Accounts of  diplomatic mission violations, departures by sea, temporary  trips without return, and Guantanamo Base infiltrations followed.    Experts on the subject say that the absence of a real U.S.  immigration policy has been obvious for more than 30 years and  the Cuban case evidently receives preferential status.    [Begin Antonio Aja, assistant director of Havana  University's  Center of Studies and Political Alternatives, recording] Unlike  other immigrants who arrive on the Florida coast and are  deported to their countries, this does not happen in the case of  Cubans. Why? Because there is a U.S. law that functions parallel  to the normal general immigration law -- the Cuban Quota  Adjustment Law, which dates back to 1966. This legislation  categorizes Cubans arriving on the Florida coasts, or the U.S.  coasts in general, as political refugees, whether or not they  are political refugees. As we have discussed in this regard, if  these people basically have an economic or social motivation, or  if their goal is a family reunion, they do not qualify as  political refugees. Furthermore, they have no... [end recording]    The U.S. immigration policy toward Cuba is closely linked to  a vast propaganda campaign supported by the media, which  manipulates public opinion and, in many cases, magnifies the  events.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified speaker] The U.S. Coast  Guard  has reported that 37 Cubans were rescued in the Gulf as they  approached Florida. Arturo Cobo, director of the Stock Island  Refugee Center, gives some of the newly arrived persons' names.  [passage indistinct]    [Aja] Floridian press and radio stations refer to the topic  of the rafters, the human problem involved. It is true that they  publish the number of people who arrive; it is also true that  they give weather reports and sea conditions for navigation on  the coast. It is also true that they talk about Hands to the  Rescue, an organization that reportedly exists to rescue those  who try to illegally emigrate by sea. In other words, a series  of subliminal messages are sent from Florida by the press and  radio; and logically, this.... [end recording]    Aja's opinion and this reporter's information are not  enough.  It is also necessary to include the views of those who leave  their lives to fate and decide to embark on the sea adventure. A  northwest-bound floating craft leaves under cover of darkness.  Who are they? No one knows. Their goal? To go beyond the 90-mile  barrier and reach the United States.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified speaker] We leave the coast  behind. We are tense. We think of nothing. We are tense because  we do not know what might happen. We row all night long [words  indistinct]. Dawn comes and we are far away. We can see the  shore by then.    [Costales] Did not you think about your family and their  concern about you?    [Unidentified speaker] Yes, of course. I left here without  saying where I was going. Later, when we were rowing, we were  tense and looking around in case something was coming, or  someone was coming to rescue us. I decided to leave on the spur  of the moment. Later, I realized [words indistinct]. Also, I did  not feel good here. There is no hope, there is no future. [end  recording]    The Cuban Government has been receptive and has implemented  a  process that renders emigration laws more flexible. The United  States, however, continues to close its doors to legal  immigrations, but is willing to maintain a flow of illegal  immigrations as an argument to maintain its stance against Cuba.</p>

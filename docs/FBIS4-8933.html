			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Meciar, chairman of the Movement </F> for a Democratic Slovakia, by Viera Urbanova; place and date not  given: "Scandals Surrounding the President Are Deepening the  Moral Crisis; Former Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar on the  Political and Economic Aspects of the Provisional Government's  Policy Statement"]    [Text] On Wednesday [13 April], coalition deputies  expressed support for their government by approving its policy  statement, which came about at lightning speed. Although an  economy cannot be taken over from one day to the next, the  broad-coalition government has presented its policy statement as  a way out of a crisis into which society had been led by the  Meciar government. Former Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar  regards the Moravcik Cabinet's philosophy of economic reform as  an irreparable historical error. According to the former prime  minister, Slovakia will not be able to cope with a third change  in economic reform. He warns against the treacherous form of  privatization [envisaged by the present government] and voices  apprehensions about the development of democracy in Slovakia.    [Urbanova] How do you evaluate the concept of the  provisional government's policy statement?    [Meciar] The policy statement is full of contradictions.  Its contents do not express a cohesive philosophy of  development; it is more or less a descriptive document. Given  the term of office that the government has ahead of itself, the  statement should literally have had the form of a schedule. It  should have been subdivided into days and assignments that need  to be resolved in every period of time. I assess the concept of  the policy statement negatively. The building of the state and  the building of the state administration have come to a halt.  The policy statement does not address these issues at all. It  envisages the third change of economic reform in Slovakia.  Slovakia cannot cope with that. It cannot start anew for the  third time in 14 months. Our concept of economic development  and the revenue part of the budget was based on the philosophy  of recovery. The provisional government's concept is based on  the philosophy of restrictions. To survive, it will transfer to  the state budget more than 5 billion korunas' worth of resources  from the National Property Fund initially designated for  structural changes in the economy. The crisis in society will  deepen, but it will not be resolved.    A change in the perception of social relations is making  itself felt. The principle of egalitarianism and down-leveling  is appearing in many respects, and the development of social  policy is again acquiring a consumer character, in lieu of a  balanced and differentiated interest [sentence as published].  Those who worked hard in the mines or steel mills for 20 years  and those who stole and were in prison for 20 years will be  equally well off in their retirement. The merit principle will  be erased.    [Urbanova] Privatization will represent a key aspect [of the  new government's policy]. To what extent has the new government  deflected from the path on which you embarked?    [Meciar] The concept of the new government contains a  treacherously hidden change of the whole process of  privatization. Outwardly, the concept appears to be very liberal  because they want to offer up to 50 percent of state-owned  property to the citizens. In reality, however, the citizens will  be robbed. A huge capital surplus will be created on the market  so the value of the property will drop steeply. When this  happens, the citizens will accept the offer to sell their  shares, but at considerably lower prices than the value the  shares would have a few years later. Two effects are being  pursued in this way. The actual execution of ownership rights  will be concentrated in the hands of [investment] funds and not  in the hands of holders of investment coupons. And these shares  will be quickly bought up, also with respect to the funds'  holders. Our government's effort to create a strong middle and  capital-owning class in Slovakia will be slowed down or  indefinitely postponed. The function of the National Property  Fund in relation to the budget will change, as well, because  privatization revenue will no longer represent a supplementary  source of budget revenue. Essentially, property will be given  away. Whereas we have been criticized for selling some things  cheaply (but someone always had to pay for it), now there will  not be any payment at all. The reasoning behind this is that  the Christian Democrats have a relatively strong position in  investment funds, and they therefore suppose that, with their  help, they will get hold of the economy more quickly.    [Urbanova] The policy statement is the product of an  agreement arrived at by members of a broad coalition. Is this  an indication that even political entities as diverse as those  that constitute the government can reach a consensus?    [Meciar] The right-left or, if you want, left-right  coalition has worked out a mechanism of negotiations that does  not permit any dynamism of development. Everything is being  halted and indefinitely postponed on which the government  entities do not have identical programs. It is apparent that  the importance of the Hungarian political parties, which hold  the balance of power, is growing. The Moravcik government is  thus compelled to make concessions to them and is therefore  afraid of making public all of the agreements it has concluded  with them. One of the agreements is to recall Ivan Gasparovic,  chairman of the parliament, in late April and to replace him  with Peter Weiss. There have already been coalition talks on  this issue. At every step, democracy is being violated. The  moral crisis in society is being deepened by efforts to seize  power without regard for the democratic principles and by the  growing scandals surrounding the president. Not all of them  have been made public.    [Urbanova] Some of your deputies claim that the provisional  government's policy statement copies, for the most part, your  own policy statement....    [Meciar] Rhetorically it does. They quote many parts from  our own program but, because these parts are isolated, they say  nothing. The minister of education's rhetoric, for example, is  not bad, but he has no money to implement it. Even though they  have adopted elements from our program, these elements are not  connected by any underlying philosophy and do not represent an  economically substantiated whole. The entire philosophy of  economic reform represented by [Deputy Prime Minister] Mrs.  Schmognerova and others is a historically irreparable error.  The citizen will have to pay a social and political price for  it, but entrepreneurs, too, who could have constituted a real  and competitive social class, will have to bear the consequences.    [Urbanova] What is your view of the crusade against  REPUBLIKA?    [Meciar] I protest against the steps being taken against  REPUBLIKA and TA SR, and against the planned changes in  television and radio. We never did anything like this. This is  no longer a question of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia  but one of whether we will be a democratic state. If the idea  of parliamentarianism, the right of citizens to express their  views in a referendum, and the right to express one's views  freely are ignored, it is impossible to keep silent.</p>

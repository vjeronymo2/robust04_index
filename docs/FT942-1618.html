			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Shanks &amp; McEwan cuts dividend Shanks &amp; McEwan, the waste management company, yesterday cut its dividend by 43 per cent and warned that uncertainty over government plans for bans on imported hazardous waste could lead to further disappointment in its Rechem business. Mr Gordon Waddell, chairman, was announcing the group's plunge into the red with pre-tax losses of Pounds 6m (Pounds 10.2m profits) for the year to March 26. The swing into loss was the result of a Pounds 20m exceptional charge, which was flagged in a letter to shareholders in March, for losses on construction contracts and rationalisation. Sales were down by 9 per cent to Pounds 120m, largely due to declines in the construction division and Rechem, the hazardous waste business. Mr Waddell said Rechem's results had been disappointing, with lower waste tonnages and technical problems in the plants. This division would continue to be plagued by uncertainty until it became clear whether the government would ban imports of hazardous waste. The UK incineration industry faces a difficult period over the next few years. Currently the government can ban hazardous waste imports, on which the group increasingly relies for revenue, but regulations to stop the dumping of treated hazardous waste into landfill sites are not expected for some time. The dumping ban is widely expected to prompt a surge in demand for incineration. Mr Waddell welcomed a recent government comment that incineration of imported waste could continue in limited quantities for up to three years. This was not enough, however. 'Until we get some clarity, we are in serious trouble,' he said. To reflect this uncertainty, the final dividend is cut from 3.44p to 1p, for a total of 3.24p (5.68p). Losses per share were 5p against earnings of 4.1p last time. The other businesses were doing well, Mr Waddell said. The solid waste division had pushed through price increases of up to 15 per cent in the south of England without any reduction in volume. COMMENT Mr Waddell's blunt warning on the regulatory risks surrounding the high margin hazardous waste business overshadows a further problem - volumes are falling as well. While this may be offset by rationalisation and an improved performance from landfill and construction, the shares will almost certainly reflect the above difficulties. Forecasts are equally uncertain, ranging from Pounds 13.9m to Pounds 19m for this year. A prospective multiple of 12.5 on the most optimistic forecast might just attract high risk/high reward investors.</p>

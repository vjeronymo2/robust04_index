			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / Water group refuses to recognise union SOUTH WEST WATER, one of the 10 privatised water services companies, has refused to recognise Unison, Britain's biggest union created this year by the merger of three public services unions. The decision not to recog-nise Unison is the second in the water industry - Wessex took similar action earlier this year. The move affects nearly 800 of the company's 2,200 employees and is in part a consequence of the unions' merger. South West Water said the merger meant that Unison had moved more firmly into the public sector and this was no longer appropriate for the company. The company continues to recognise the TGWU and GMB general unions for craft and industrial workers but proposed a new staff council for white-collar workers.</p>

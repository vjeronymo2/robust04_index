			<p><P> August 23, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> INNOVATIVE FACILITY;  </P> <P> OPERATOR FOR OCEANSIDE HOMELESS CENTER SELECTED  </P> <P> The Women's Resource Center of Oceanside was selected Tuesday to manage the  city's innovative trailer park for homeless families.  </P> <P> The Oceanside City Council members, sitting as the Community Development  Commission, voted unanimously and without discussion to award the contract to  the women's center. City Housing Committee members Councilwomen Lucy Chavez and  Melba Bishop, had previously recommended that the center be given the contract  based on its successful nine-year track record as manager of the Oceanside  Battered Women's Shelter.  </P> <P> The Escondido-based North County Interfaith Council had also submitted a  proposal to run the homeless shelter, which will consist of 15 trailers  situated on a 22-acre site on the grounds of the San Luis Rey Mission. Families  whose members have been screened for substance abuse, criminal records and  psychiatric problems will be eligible to stay in the shelter for up to 60 days.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'More in Tune'  </P> <P> After the meeting, Chavez said that she and Bishop had chosen the Women's  Resource Center because "they seem to be more in tune with the type of shelter  and the type of occupants we intended." Chavez said they felt the center's  staff had gained experience, through working with battered women and children,  with many of the similar problems that might arise with homeless families.  </P> <P> "We're determined to make this work and to make it as non-offensive as possible  to the surrounding neighborhood," Bishop said. "It's a prototype for all  others. . . . If this doesn't work, there won't be another."  </P> <P> The experimental program is limited to three years, which is the duration of  the lease on the mission site, which will open this fall. But members of  Oceanside's Task Force for the Homeless, which conceived the plan, hope that,  if all goes well, the community will recognize the need to contribute land and  money for a permanent facility.  </P> <P> The city has allocated $300,000 for the shelter's operation, but City Housing  Director Richard Goodman estimated that it will cost up to $450,000 to  effectively run the program for three years. Women's Resource Center  spokeswoman Sharon Newcomb said Tuesday that the agency is prepared to raise  the rest of the money needed through government grants and community donations.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Recruitment of Staff  </P> <P> One of the agency's first tasks will be to recruit personnel to staff the  homeless shelter, Newcomb said. The center will seek a full-time shelter  administrator who will have overall responsibility for the project, a project  supervisor to handle day-to-day operations, and five caseworkers with  experience in providing counseling, support and dealing with domestic disputes.  </P> <P> Newcomb said the focus of the program will be to teach homeless families how to  function in the world around them and to make use of available services. "Our  goal is not to make an insulated community out of this but help them  reintegrate into the community," she said. "We feel it's real important the  clients make their own decisions and take action for themselves."  </P> <P> Among the highlights of the program is a class in "survival skills" that will  be offered free by MiraCosta College. The daily class will include instruction  on nutrition, budget and home management, balancing checking accounts and  utilizing community resources.  </P> <P> Case workers will review each family's situation with them, and try to pinpoint  the factors that contributed to their homelessness and recommend courses of  action to avoid those problems, according to the proposal. Weekly classes on  landlord-tenant rights and responsibilities, including instruction on "tenant  etiquette" will be offered at the center, as well as job evaluations and  referrals.  </P> <P> A child-care system will be set up among the residents, and school-age children  will attend classes in the Oceanside Unified School District. Under the  proposal, the staff of the Women's Resource Center also will provide training  to teachers to heighten their sensitivity to the traumas and insecurities that  homeless children experience.  </P></p>

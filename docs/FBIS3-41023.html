			<p>Language: <F P=105> Latvian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A delegation from the Latvian Saeima, consisting of  representatives of all the groups, has returned from a visit to  the United States of America. Deputy Andrejs Pantelejevs today  told a news conference that the aim of the visit was to discuss  the issues of Latvian national security.    The delegation was also received by U.S. President Bill  Clinton and Secretary of State Warren Christopher. It became  clear during the talks that the United States of America viewed  the withdrawal of the Russian Army not only as Latvia's internal  issue, but rather as a problem of all-European and American  security systems.    One of the most complicated issues is the fate of the  Skrunda  radar station. Russia has expressed the wish to use it for  another four years and after that, it will scrap it within 18  months. In that case, Russia would withdraw all the troops from  Latvia by 31 August this year. That is the best option which  Latvia would have to accept, said Deputy Jevgenijs Zoscerinskis.  Such a compromise would satisfy all the European countries.    Deputy Maris Grinblats for his part assessed the results of  the visit very briefly -- they tried to persuade us that the  world would be glad if we give in on this issue.</p>

			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Arts: Schreker's grand magic opera - Andrew Clark on two rare revivals in Bielefeld and Zurich THOSE WHO know Franz Schreker's music only from Die Gezeichneten, Der ferne Klang or Der Schatzgraber would be intrigued by Der Schmied von Gent, currently enjoying a persuasive revival at Bielefeld. The three operas which shot Schreker to fame immediately before and after the First World War (and now forming the basis of the Schreker renaissance) are a hothouse of sound and feeling, expertly orchestrated but shrouded in empty symbolism. Der Schmied von Gent is altogether more straightforward and entertaining. Premiered in Berlin in 1932 less than two years before Schreker's premature death, it suggests the direction his music might have taken if he had not fallen foul of the Nazis. Gone is the trademark richness of style which by the mid-1920s was already out of fashion. In its place comes a dry, contrapuntal language not unlike Hindemith and Weill. What is most striking is its simplicity  - the way Schreker uses a few ideas with imagination - and his ability to pull off such a radical transformation. Only in scenes of great sentiment do we hear his more familiar self. A 'grand magic opera' in three acts, Der Schmied von Gent is based on an old Flemish fairy tale about a blacksmith who sells his soul to the devil in return for seven years of prosperity. When his time is up, he outwits the devil and scrapes into heaven. Smee the smith and his wife are an operatic Mr and Mrs Bloggs - dreaming of the better life, God-fearing when it suits, decidedly unheroic. A single act of kind-heartedness to a destitute refugee couple and their baby (Joseph, Mary and the Christ child) saves Smee's soul - a prescient touch to a German opera of the 1930s, even more so in the light of Germany's current preoccupation with xenophobia. Schreker respects the primitive naivety of the tale, but sprinkles it with comic and ironic touches. As a result, Der Schmied von Gent communicates well: it is an opera of the common man. That, at least, was the impression left by this production. John Dew's staging, with cartoon-like fluorescent decor by Thomas Gruber and plain modern costumes by Wolfgang Kalk, focused on clear visual symbols. Set-pieces such as the Wife's prayer and the skeletons' Dance of Death had an appealing directness. The finale at the pearly gates was a parody of Everyman's view of paradise: three camp angels prancing about in feathered wings, St Peter resembling a bouncer and Joseph presiding like a benevolent televangelist. In the bass-baritone title role, Erling Onsager gave a solid performance, and there were some characterful cameos in the smaller parts. But Krystyna Michalowska made a prosaic, off-pitch Wife and Rainer Koch's conducting left too many gaps between pit and stage. Running parallel to this popular Bielefeld production was Die Gezeichneten (The Branded) at the Zurich Opera House. Here the old doubts about Schreker resurfaced. For all its cinematic colour, the score is constantly promising melodies which never materialise. The plot revolves around neurotic, over-sexed aristocrats (too many male voices), none of whom does anything to earn our sympathy. Was this really the same steamy pot-boiler which the Frankfurt and Dusseldorf stagings of the 1980s so convincingly brought to life? Jonathan Miller's Zurich production updated the work to the early 20th century and drained it of dramatic contrast. Peter Davison's single set consisted of colourless facades, the Act three Elysium looking more like a shell-shocked military hospital than a den of vice. Dressed in Jon Morrell's stiff costumes, the cast resembled frigid members of the haute-bourgeoisie, an impression reinforced by the torpid stage direction. The Zurich public must have wondered where Dr Miller earned his reputation. There was some compensation in Eliahu Inbal's powerful, purposeful conducting and a well-matched cast. Roland Hermann made a tall, blue-blooded Tamare, Alfred Muff a stalwart Duke Adorno. Gabriele Lechner turned the artist Carlotta into a majestic dilettante: she knows how to act with her eyes and voice, and made the most of her soaring lines in the big Act one duet. The weak point was Alviano, the physically repellant Genoese nobleman around whom the plot revolves: Jyrki Niskanen, a plausible-sounding tenor, spent most of the evening searching for his cues.</p>

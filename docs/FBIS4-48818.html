			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By political correspondent Pierre Claassen] </F>   [Text] National Assembly May 26 SAPA -- The first political  blows between the ANC and NP [National Party] partners in the  new government of national unity were exchanged on Thursday,  leaving members booing and hissing at the podium. Speaking from  it, and attacking ANC Housing Minister Mr Joe Slovo, was the  National Party's Mr Piet Coetzer -- called "a National Party hit  man" by a subsequent speaker.    Mr Coetzer started off by commenting on what he called a  "honeymoon debate" filed with non-confrontational maiden  speeches. An air of unreality prevailed while the tough debate  lay ahead, he predicted.    He then turned on Mr Slovo as having broken with tradition  in  his maiden speech and said:    "If you don't behave like a maiden, don't expect to be  treated as one."    Mr Slovo, he said, had attacked Deputy President F W de  Klerk  (his party leader) for distorting the past about the delivery  and payment of services. "There is a gap between his (Mr  Slovo's) interpretation and the truth of the past," Mr Coetzer  said.    Mr Coetzer then quoted statistics of serviced sites  delivered  by the Transvaal Provincial Administration. It far exceeded the  25,000 units a year Mr Slovo had referred to, he said.    Furthermore, if Mr Slovo wanted to apportion blame, he  himself would have to admit to the ANC's share or his dreams for  housing would blow up in his face. "While local authorities were  trying, the ANC was promoting a policy of making the country  ungovernable. It must now accept responsibility for boycotts and  non-payment of services," he said.    Despite an agreement between Mr de Klerk and President  Nelson  Mandela in January this year that the rent boycott would stop,  income from services had continued to drop to a national average  of 20 percent. In Soweto it was far below 10 percent. The  monthly income there was R[Rand]900,000 whereas the annual water  bill alone was R4 million.    In central Witwatersrand alone R400 million of regional  services council funds had been spent on running costs instead  of the infrastructural expenditure it was intended for.    "If this culture is not reversed, you will not succeed in  realising this (housing) dream," Mr Coetzer said.    He wanted to plead with the state president not to try and  convert the country into a welfare state, but rather to create  conditions under which people could improve their own  circumstances.    As Mr Coetzer finished many boo's and hisses came from ANC  members.    Next speaker was ANC member Mr Jannie Momberg -- like Mr  Coetzer a carry-over from the previous Parliament. He said he  wanted to inform his new colleagues that in the past, when the  National Party was in trouble, "they used to send in Piet  Coetzer as their hit man".    "At this stage, I did not think the NP was in trouble," he  remarked, to mirth.    He reminded the assembly that today, May 26, was the  anniversary of the National Party takeover of power in 1948.    "On that day a few hundred thousand people gained their  freedom from English dominance at the cost of 40 million (sic)."    Now 40 million people had gained their freedom at the cost  of  no-one.</p>

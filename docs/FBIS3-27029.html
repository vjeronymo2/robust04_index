Last year 35 civilian  conflicts and armed disputes took place, leaving eight dead and  causing direct economic losses of 140,000 yuan, a decrease of  respectively 66 percent, 62 percent, and 79 percent as compared  with the previous year. In preventing civilian conflicts and  armed disputes, all levels of the departments were firm in  implementing the central and provincial arrangements, were quick  to act, and were efficient in their measures.    Early last year, the provincial government signed agreements  with the relevant prefectural, city, and provincial departments  on preventing and mediating civilian conflicts and armed  disputes. They organized personnel to mediate and resolve 29  cases of civilian conflicts. Ganzhou, Jian, and Jingdezhen  authorities conducted a no-armed-dispute campaign this year, and  they were successful.</p>

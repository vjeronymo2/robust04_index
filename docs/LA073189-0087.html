			<p><P> July 31, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ISRAEL PROPOSES TRADING PRISONERS WITH SHIITES  </P> <P> Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel today proposed trading all his  country's Shiite Muslim captives for all captured Israeli soldiers and foreign  hostages held by Shiite groups in Lebanon.  </P> <P> Israeli officials said they had received no immediate confirmation of a claim  from a Shiite group that it executed a U.S. Marine hostage to retaliate for  Israel's abduction of a Shiite cleric.  </P> <P> But they reiterated Rabin's offer, made earlier in the day.  </P> <P> "Israel repeats its call for the release of Israeli and other hostages held by  Shiite groups in Lebanon. Israel is offering to trade prisoners, detainees and  hostages," Rabin told reporters in Tel Aviv.  </P> <P> His statement, read from a prepared text, was also broadcast on state-run  Israel radio. Avi Pazner, spokesman for Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, said the  offer was made on behalf of the government.  </P> <P> "According to this proposal, all the Israeli prisoners and foreign hostages  held by Shiite groups in Lebanon would be swapped for all the Shiite prisoners  kept by Israel, including Sheik Abdel Karim Obeid, Jawad Kasfi and others," he  said. "The exchange would be conducted through the International Red Cross  according to the procedures accepted in such cases."  </P> <P> Obeid is an influential Shiite Muslim cleric kidnaped by Israeli commandos  Friday in south Lebanon, and Kasfi is another Lebanese Shiite seized by Israeli  forces in Lebanon last December.  </P> <P> Security sources estimate 50 to 60 Shiite Muslims from Lebanon are held in  Israeli prisons.  </P> <P> The Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army militia, which helps patrol Israel's  self-declared security zone in south Lebanon, holds about 300 Shiites in a  prison at Khiam in south Lebanon. It was not immediately clear if this group  would be part of the deal.  </P> <P> Deputy Prime Minister Shimon Peres said earlier today that Israeli officials  hoped that Obeid can be swapped for three Israeli soldiers missing in Lebanon  since 1986.  </P></p>

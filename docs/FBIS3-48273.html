The meeting, which began at 2 P.M.,  is to be followed by a meeting of Bentsen and Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa at the premier's official residence at 4 P.M.    Greeting Bentsen at his office in the presence of reporters,  the finance minister said he recognized that the defeat of the  government's political reform bills "has caused you concern" and  said he would explain the matter. The rejection of the bills  Friday in the House of Councillors is expected to complicate  Hosokawa's efforts to introduce economic stimulus measures in  time for a February 11 summit between Hosokawa and President  Bill Clinton in Washington.    Bentsen stopped over in Tokyo on Saturday night on his way  home from a tour of Russia and Asia. His talks with Hosokawa  and Fujii are expected to focus on efforts to reach an agreement  in bilateral trade talks in time for the summit.</p>

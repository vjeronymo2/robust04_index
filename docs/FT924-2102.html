			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Monarchy targeted in Benn proposal PENSIONING off the royal family, disestablishing the Church of England and abolishing the House of Lords were proposed by Mr Tony Benn yesterday in an attempt to push the case for republicanism after the Queen's self-confessed 'annus horribilis'. The Labour MP for Chesterfield's Commonwealth of Britain Bill was presented to the Commons for the second time with its author able to claim that one provision was already in place: the prime minister has announced that the Queen will pay income tax from next year. Mr Benn said that if the Maastricht treaty was ratified, the Queen's status would be further undermined. She would, in effect, become a citizen of Europe, able to vote in European elections. It would make a further mockery of Britain's constitution based on 'a network of oaths of allegiance,' he said. Mr Benn - an opponent of Maastricht - said that 'to have an oath of allegiance to another citizen in a European union is quite a big change, much bigger than I'm proposing.' He first presented the bill in the last parliament, when it was not even discussed by MPs. But Mr Benn said it has provoked debate and had become a set text for some students. Moreover, in the past few weeks, with the separation of the Prince and Princess of Wales, 'the magic and mystery' had disappeared from the monarchy. His bill proposes the transfer of royal palaces to the state and stripping all power from the monarch but giving her a state pension and accommodation. Mr Benn's bill would set up a House of Commons and a House of the People. There would be an elected president, national parliaments for England, Scotland and Wales, and a charter of rights. Britain would withdraw from Northern Ireland. The bill is extremely unlikely to be debated.</p>

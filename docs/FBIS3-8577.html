"I will accept the Sejm's decision with full understanding  and respect, and with the hope that the tribunal will be  impartial, honest and just," said the general who introduced  martial law in Poland on 13 December, 1981 after 16 months of a  political showdown between the solidarity trade union and the  communist authorities.    Today's session of the Sejm Committee for Constitutional  Accountability was the first in a series of sessions during  which Jaruzelski and other former politicians accused of  implementing martial law will answer questions from MP's.</p>

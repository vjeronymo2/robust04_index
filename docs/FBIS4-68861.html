			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Heorhiy Kopchynskyy, former first deputy </F> chairman, Derzhkomnahlyad (State Committee on Nuclear Power  Oversight), by A. Panov, correspondent: "Nuclear Power  Engineering Has No Right To Exist if It Is Unsafe for People's  Lives!"; place and date not given]    [Text]    [Panov] You and I have known each other for a long time,  since 1974--when you came to work at the Technical  Administration of the Ukrainian Ministry of Energy and  Electrification. And later all I heard about you concerned your  precipitous upward flight to the country's highest echelon of  power--the CPSU Central Committee and the USSR Council of  Ministers.    [Kopchynskyy] I started out at the Physics Institute of the  Ukrainian SSR Academy of Sciences, then I moved to the Ministry  of Energy and Electrification, and in 1976 I was sent to the  Chernobyl AES, at first in the post of deputy chief engineer for  scientific matters, and then--for operations. I took part in the  start-up of the first units there. Then I worked for three years  as director of the Smolensk AES, and in 1983 I was transferred  to the post of chief of the Nuclear Power Engineering Sector  under the Department of Heavy Industry and Power Engineering  within the CPSU Central Committee. After M. Gorbachev did away  with the sectorial departments within the CPSU Central  Committee, I moved over to the post of chief of the Department  of Nuclear Power Engineering and Industry under the USSR Council  of Ministers. My sphere of competence there encompassed all the  facilities engaged in nuclear power engineering, including the  gigantic centers of the USSR Ministry of Medium Machine Building  and the USSR Academy of Sciences. In 1991 I returned to Kiev.  This decision took a long time to ripen within me, but with the  disintegration of the Soviet Union made it final.    [Panov] Did you know about the activity of the "Greens" in  Ukraine?    [Kopchynskyy] I certainly did. This was one of the reasons  why I began to devote more time and effort to studying safety  problems at AES's. The principal reason was, of course, the  Chernobyl catastrophe, as well as the continued, conscious  yearning to develop nuclear power construction at any price. If  you recall, even after the Chernobyl disaster and the shutting  down of the Crimean, Odessa, and Kharkov AES's, the people at  the State Plan insisted on a figure of 36 million kilowatts of  nuclear capacity in Ukraine. A group of scientists at the  Ukrainian SSR Academy of Sciences headed up by B. Paton  requested that this figure be lowered to 28 million; whereas the  "Greens" insisted on a moratorium. The then deputy chairman of  the Ukrainian SSR Council of Ministers, V. Hladush, the minister  of energy and electrification, V. Sklyarov, and I endeavored to  persuade the people at the State Plan that it could not ignore  public opinion and that this could lead to unforeseen  consequences. Unfortunately, most of the highly placed persons  in Moscow failed to understand this; they behaved incorrectly in  their relations with people, and this simply caused an outcry.  The habit of a command style, secrecy, and a certain conscious  exclusivity could not be overcome even by Chernobyl. Nobody  wanted to consciously acknowledge that the nuclear power people  were to blame for Chernobyl and that exerting pressure on public  opinion had no future prospects.    [Panov] Today the president of Ukraine has signed an Edict  on  the development of nuclear power engineering without a public  discussion on the matter; it even bears the designation "Not for  Press Release." Doesn't it seem to you that this is a return to  the old days?....    [Kopchynskyy] I don't think that this was done on the  president's initiative. More likely it was activated by certain  departmental structures with the active support of certain  officials from the apparatus of the Cabinet of Ministers. But as  to a return to the old days, this situation certainly is very  reminiscent of the pre-perestroyka period, when safety problems  were put on the back burner. What was put on the front burner  was kilowatt-hours. Come on, come on, let's have more and  more.... There was a demand for increasing capacity no matter  what the price. And this tendency is now manifesting itself in  Ukraine--all nuclear matters are to be gathered into one pair of  hands, everything kept behind a curtain of secrecy, decisions  made without coordination or reconciliation with specialists and  with the general public. I have observed this tendency over the  course of a year, and the decision with regard to Chernobyl was  a serious argument for submitting my resignation.    [Panov] It's a well-known fact that construction of the  Chernobyl AES was carried out at an intensive pace: The builders  were hounded, and the units had to be started up as soon as  possible. And so how do you assess the quality of this  construction?    [Kopchynskyy] Of course, there were problems, but the  quality  of the construction at the Chernobyl AES was far from ranking  last in comparison with certain other nuclear power stations.  The construction chief, A. Klyzyma, was a wonderful leader, and  V. Bryukhanov was a high-principled director; he was not afraid  to argue with his superiors. But the RBMK [uranium-graphite,  heterogenous, single-loop, boiling-water reactor] units  themselves were too heavy from the viewpoint of physics,  thermohydraulics, and dynamics. The construction of the safety  systems in the design of these facilities was inferior. The  safety and control systems were solved in an academically  incorrect manner. On the whole, the level of safety standards  here in our country is significantly lower than in the West.  Nowhere abroad is there such a cavalier-type attitude toward the  positive effect of the capacity to react in a timely and  eficient manner as there is in our country.    [Panov] But how did it happen that--when the Supreme Council  adopted the decision to lift the moratorium and continue  operations at the Chernobyl AES--there were essentially no  opponents, nor was there a principled approach to this matter on  the part of the Derzhatomnahlyad?    [Kopchynskyy] The fact of the matter was that we were not  even forewarned that such a decision was about to be taken, and  at the previous session of the Supreme Council Presidium nobody  spoke except for Derzhatom. Neither the Derzhatomnahlyad, nor  the Ministry of Environmental Protection, nor the Ministry of  Health. There was a tendency.... And at the session of the  Supreme Council itself nobody was interested in listening to  opponents. There was a clamor, and that was all there was to it.    We submitted several notes to the Cabinet of Ministers and  to  the president in which we expressed our opinion. It boiled down  to this: During the wintertime maximum utilization of power it  was impossible to shut Chernobyl down, but after the winter this  must be done. It should be done gradually, as other, alternative  capacities come on line. But when the motion was made to revive  Unit No. 2 at the Chernobyl AES, this became utterly  incomprehensible. Why was it necessary to do so? This unit is an  old one, and the safety systems are insufficient. Furthermore,  we have no problems of power-generating capacities at present.  There is no need for additional electric power because the  economy is in a state of crisis. All this attests to the fact  that what is a work here is a consciously extered pressure; the  government is returning to its old-time procedures.    [Panov] Heorhiy Oleksiyovych, here in Kiev you held a solid  post as first deputy chief of the Derzhatomnahlyad. Just what  was it--after all--that made you leave it?    [Kopchynskyy] That's a long story, Anatoliy Mykhaylovych,  and  quite a complicated one. When the USSR Derzhatomnahlyad was  created in 1984, there were many obstacles from various  quarters. We had to struggle and to prove that such a committee  was necessary. Because, you know, prior to this there had been  only departmental monitoring controls; the attitude toward the  problems of nuclear safety was--to put it mildly--cavalierish. I  was badly bruised along this path and was frequently in  conflict-type situations. Then the Chernobyl catastrophe  occurred, and after that--after the initial shock had worn  off--the leading officials of the Union-level departments again  manifested the same old tendency to belittle safety problems; it  became evident that there was a return to the old ways. I  decided to move to Ukraine and to attempt to accomplish  something here. The chief of the Ukrainian Derzhatomnahlyad, M.  Shetynberg, and I reached a mutual understanding, and we set to  work. We prepared draft laws on radiation protection and the use  of nuclear power, a program for building up the infrastructure  of nuclear power engineering, a whole series of normative  documents, and various proposals regarding the modernization  reconstruction of AES's. In time, however, it became obvious  that the Government leaders had begun to look askance in our  direction; they were beginning to express the thought that the  main thing for Ukraine nowadays was to survive. It was evident  that that the organ for the state regulation of safety at AES's  was becoming a burden for these leaders. We ceased to be invited  to deliberations where the fate of nuclear power engineering was  being decided. All our endeavors to create a safety system based  on world approaches evoked active opposition from the  government. The final straw in this matter was the decision to  continue operations at the Chernobyl AES. I decided that I had  had enough. I don't want to remain in a 1986-type situation  anymore. I went through a great deal that year, superhuman  pressure--psychological, physical, and moral. I was hounded by  the following thoughts: What had happened and why? What must be  done to make sure that such things do not happen again?...    I don't want to remain anymore in such a situation. I don't  wish to be in the Ukrainian Derzhatomnahlyad if all the  decisions are being made without it, if these decisions  contradict that concept of safety which should prevail in  Ukraine--a country where the greatest technical-type catastrophe  in the history of humankind occurred.    We must be ensured and re-ensured against any such  catastrophes. Nuclear power engineering does not have the right  to exist if it is unsafe for people's lives.    I don't want to bear responsibility for the Supreme Council  and the Government of Ukraine. Therefore, I decided to leave.    I have never maintained that nuclear power engineering is  completely unnecessary. But I am categorically opposed to a lack  of responsibility and and a conscious lack of principles on the  part of the departments concerned.</p>

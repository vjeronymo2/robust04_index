According to the latest  press reports, not only the chief but also leading functionaries  of the North Rhine-Westphalian land association were involved  "in crimes and the covering up of crimes."    The reports are based, among other things, on a  comprehensive  dossier from the Duesseldorf Interior Ministry. According to  it, several documents seized from Republikaners prove that the  right-wing extremists "discussed" behind closed doors "the  potential origin, accomplices, or prevention of the  clarification of crimes." One North Rhine-Westphalian  functionary, among others, is suspected of having planned and,  together with others, carried out the arson attack in  Bergheim-Zieverich. In addition, the dossier reportedly also  contains indications of further "readiness for violence" of the  right-wing extremists. These include one "mock execution" by  two members of the Muehlheim district Republikaner, which caused  the death of a Turk with a heart condition.    Schoenhuber, Mr. Clean, is getting into a dubious light  because, like the land association, he reportedly knew about the  events in North Rhine-Westphalia, but did not do anything about  it. TAGESSPIEGEL bases its report on a former member of the  Republikaner, who claims to have sent corresponding minutes to  Schoenhuber and repeatedly phoned Schoenhuber's office, calling  on the party chairman to expel the accused party colleague and  contact the police. Schoenhuber denies it.    Schoenhuber's attempt to present his party as extreme right  wing but still conforming to the Constitution and to separate it  from those rightist parties that are clearly hostile to the  Constitution threatens to fail in other respects, too. Not only  parts of the German People's Union (DVU), but also the neo-Nazis  of the National List (NL) are calling for active election  support for the Republikaner. Says an NL strategy paper: "If  Schoenhuber gets about 30 deputies into the Bundestag with  perhaps 5 percent, there will be some `deviants from the right'  among them. Having only one single (autonomous)  ultra-radical-nationalist deputy there would be a similar  advantage for the `National Opposition' as Christian Democratic  Union Deputy Krause, who has changed over to the Republikaner."    In Saxony the Office for the Protection of the Constitution  now uses intelligence service means to monitor the Republikaner  and has noticed that leading Republikaner cooperate with  neo-Nazis. This was announced by CDU Interior Minister Eggert  on Wednesday [13 April]. Nine of the 16 laender are now using  intelligence service means against the Republikaner.</p>

			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / Heathrow tunnel probe focuses on design Investigators into the tunnel collapse at Heathrow Airport are concentrating their inquiries on the possibility that human error or design problems may have caused the collapse. BAA, the airport authority, confirmed yesterday that its inquiry had found nothing so far to suggest that the New Austrian Tunnelling Method being used to excavate two new underground stations beneath the airport was unsuitable for use in London clay. The investigation led by Mr David Williams, BAA's projects director, is working closely with the Health and Safety Executive which is conducting a separate inquiry into the collapse. BAA said that both investigations were 'focusing inquiries on the design, workmanship and the physical ground conditions in the area'. They will examine work being done at the base of the main concourse tunnel close to Terminal Four where an initial ground movement led to the collapse. Investigators are also likely to look at monitoring equipment and procedures used to provide early warning of ground movements. In normal circumstances these would have been expected to allow sufficient time to strengthen the tunnel and prevent a collapse. Work has halted on the two Heathrow stations - which will form part of a Pounds 300m rail link between the airport and Paddington Station in central London - pending a clear outcome of the inquiries. The preliminary findings of the BAA investigation may encourage managers of the Pounds 1.9bn Jubilee Underground line extension. Work was halted at two new stations on the extension - Waterloo and London Bridge - also being built using the Austrian method.</p>

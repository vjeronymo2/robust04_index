			<p><P> March 22, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: ART  </P> <P> "Cosimo De'Medici" by Pontormo will be auctioned at Christie's in New York on  May 31, one of the most important Old Master paintings sold in the last 30  years. The Italian Renaissance painting, depicting the young Cosimo with  halberd in hand, had been on loan to the New York Frick Collection for 19  years. Frick President Charles A. Ryskamp told the New York Times that he is  devastated by the decision to sell, adding that "the Frick is determined to do  what we can to save that painting for our collection." Chauncey Cevereaux  Stillman, a New York investor and philanthropist who owned the painting, died  Jan. 24. The painting subsequently was removed by his lawyers who said it would  be sold for the benefit of the Homeland Foundation, Stillman's charitable  organization. The painting is expected to sell for more than $20 million.  ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

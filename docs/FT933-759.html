			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / World Trade News: A Japanese lure for US carmakers TOYOTA, the Japanese carmaker, announced during the summer that it would be working with Ford of the US, a competitor, on the development of cruise control systems for use in their cars. The trans-Pacific tie-up is a first for both companies. If US trade negotiators have their way, there will be more cases of co-operation in developing components between US and Japanese carmakers. Car components, like the cruise control system Ford and Toyota will be working on, are the target of a drive by the US to reduce its trade deficit with Japan by pressing the Japanese to open specific sectors to more US-made products. Last week negotiators from the two countries met in Hawaii to discuss bilateral trade in car and car parts for the first time under a new framework for talks aimed at improving the balance of trade between the US and Japan. The US in particular is keen to see Japan buy more car parts from US manufacturers since motor vehicle products last year made up 63 per cent of the Dollars 50bn (Pounds 32.4bn) US trade deficit with Japan, according to the US Department of Commerce. After a surprise show of enthusiasm by the Japanese car industry, which last year indicated its willingness to buy Y19bn (Pounds 116.5m) worth of US-made car parts in fiscal 1994, there are moves among US officials to try to set a similar target for 1995 and 1996. Their efforts are being supported by a growing interest among US car parts makers in the Japanese market. General Motors, for example, has set up a technical centre on the outskirts of Tokyo. Although it has lagged behind GM, Ford is also beginning to extend its Japanese customer base beyond traditional business partners such as Mazda in which it has a 25 per cent stake. It is building a development centre outside Tokyo - its second in Japan - where it will develop components to supply all Japanese car makers. US companies are also becoming interested in Japan as a stepping stone into the Asian market. Their greater interest in the Japanese market has even encouraged US components makers to adapt their business practices in Japan to the Japanese way. GM, for example, has joined a number of suppliers' associations - a group of preferred suppliers which work together to serve a customer and which have been criticised by the US as a symbol of Japanese industry's exclusive business practices. In public, the Japanese vehicle industry welcomes such moves by its US competitors. 'GM and Ford's presence in Japan has made a huge difference in terms of communication,' says Mr Hisashi Kamoshida, a manager in Toyota's purchasing planning division. But officials at Japanese carmakers are at pains to stress it will take time to correct the imbalance in bilateral car components trade. For one thing there is a structural reason for that imbalance - the small number of US cars sold in Japan means there is little demand for replacement parts. The absence of US car manufacturing in Japan also means demand for US components is low whereas Japanese components are in demand from Japanese carmakers which have set up facilities in the US. It also takes at least four years to develop components for a new car. In that respect, the Japanese say they are doing what they can to improve the chances of US suppliers. 'As far as car parts go we have made efforts that go beyond normal business transactions,' says Mr Hiroyoshi Ono, deputy general manager of international public affairs at Toyota. They have held seminars for US suppliers on 'design-ins' whereby they work with their suppliers to develop parts for a specific car. Although the US argues that the yen's appreciation has made US car components more cost-competitive, Japanese car companies point out that cost is not the sole determining factor. Quality, development ability, delivery time and after-sales services are also crucial. 'We can't buy a component just because it's cheap,' says Mr Masatomo Okahara, deputy general manager of Nissan's international purchasing department. US suppliers must show that they can keep up with the development pace of Japanese car makers and quickly adapt their products to the many changes made during the development of a car, something which Japanese suppliers do well. 'We are willing to buy from US suppliers if they meet our needs,' says Mr Ono. 'But there aren't that many US parts makers that are willing to take the risk to sell to us.' If GM and Ford's moves in Japan are an indication of a trend, however, Japanese carmakers could find that reversed sooner than expected.</p>

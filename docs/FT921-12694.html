			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / International Company News: Centel sale under consideration CENTEL, a Chicago-based telephone service company, yesterday underscored the wave of consolidation sweeping through the US telecommunications industry when it announced it would be examining the possible sale of the group as part of a review of strategic options. Wall Street analysts reckon the business could be worth around Dollars 5bn. Centel, which has been through a restructuring programme to shed non-core businesses over the past two years, serves about 1.6m telephone lines in seven states and has a large cellular telephone business, operating in 44 urban areas and more than 50 rural ones. Mr John Frazee, the chairman, said it had retained investment banks Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to explore strategic options. But he added that Centel had not had any discussions or inquiries from outside parties about the sale of either all or parts of the business. He explained that Centel wanted to remain in charge of its fate while the industry was consolidating, rather than possibly ending up as a bid target. Centel stock soared by 25 per cent on the New York Stock Exchange to close up 9 1/8 at Dollars 46 1/8 . Wall Street analysts said the group was most likely to be sold off in pieces and that any of the seven 'Baby Bell' regional telephone companies might be interested in parts, together with GTE, the largest local operator in the US. The analysts reckoned its break-up value could be between Dollars 55 and Dollars 60 a share, based on eight to 10 times the cash flow of its telephone operations and Dollars 200 for each potential subscriber (or 'pop') to its cellular network. Recent cellular deals have been struck around Dollars 200 per pop. Centel already has experience of hostile investors. In 1988 it fought off an attempt to gain boardroom seats launched by Mr Asher Edelman, a New York investor, and Mr George Lindemann, chairman of cellular group Metro Mobile. Metro Mobile was sold last year to Bell Atlantic, one of the Baby Bells, for Dollars 2.5bn. Other recent telecommunications takeovers include last year's Dollars 6bn purchase of Centel by GTE. Centel's growth in telephone business has been running ahead of the industry average and its cellular business has also been growing strongly. The group's fourth quarter results showed income from continuing operations of Dollars 25.7m, or 30 cents a share, up from Dollars 10m, or 11 cents a year ago, helped by a 14 cent gain on the sale of a cellular interest.</p>

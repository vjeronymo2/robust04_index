			<p><P> February 7, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 7TH CANDIDATE JOINS SAN FERNANDO RACE  </P> <P> A seventh candidate entered the San Fernando City Council race Tuesday, just  before the filing period for the April 10 election ended.  </P> <P> Robert Villafana, a social worker who chairs the city's Parks and Recreation  Commission, returned his nomination papers Tuesday, assistant city clerk Wilma  Miller said.  </P> <P> Three of the city's five council seats will be filled in the election. The  filing period was extended until Tuesday because incumbent Councilman Evelio  Franco chose not to run.  </P> <P> Two other incumbents -- Mayor Daniel Acuna and Councilman Doude Wysbeek --  filed last week. Acuna is a real estate consultant, and Wysbeek owns a local  electric motor business.  </P> <P> Four challengers also filed papers last week: Jose Hernandez, a planning  commissioner and urban studies professor at Cal State Northridge; Linda Jauron,  a businesswoman and volunteer at the San Fernando YWCA; Gabe Rodriguez, a  retired manufacturing plant supervisor and long-time San Fernando resident; and  Mary Jane Tuomy, a planning commissioner who previously served as a parks and  recreation commissioner.  </P> <P> The council governs the 2.4-square-mile city of 20,000, located in the  northeastern San Fernando Valley.  </P></p>

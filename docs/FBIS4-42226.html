			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Manfred Brunner, chairman of the League of </F> Free Citizens, by Bettina Baeumlisberger and Herbert Weber;  place and date not given: "We Are Not a Protest Party"]    [Text] [FOCUS] Your League of Free Citizens has only been  among "the also-rans" lately. Instead of the 35 percent at  which it is aiming, your party is hardly believed to be capable  of gaining 5 percent. Is the adventure of the League of Free  Citizens (BfB) already over before it really started?    [Brunner] No, the heated stage of the European election  campaign is only beginning now -- with television and radio  spots on the planned abolition of the German mark and 20  meetings with Joerg Haider. We will concentrate on a  double-digit result.    [FOCUS] You are calling for an election that is to serve as  a lesson. However, protest parties are no longer well received  by the voters.    [Brunner] We are not a protest party. We are a programmatic  party of determination. We have a concept for Europe that  develops from the friendly concentration of diversity and  rejects standardization and egalitarianism.    [FOCUS] Proceed on the assumption that you will really get  into the Strasbourg parliament. What can you change with your  small team?    [Brunner] We are not so few. Recently a meeting of the  anti-Maastricht parties took place in Paris. They come from  almost all states of the European Union. We agreed on the  formation of a parliamentary group.    We want to reform the European Parliament from the inside  and  push through the ruling of the FRG Constitutional Court that it  is basically the national parliaments that have to legitimize  Europe democratically.    [FOCUS] The parliament is to be nothing but a debating  society? Is your objective the abolition of the parliament?    [Brunner] One of my first motions will certainly be that the  European Parliament change its name to "European Assembly."    [FOCUS] Do you think that the efforts to grant the  parliament more legislative powers are wrong?    [Brunner] Absolutely. This would only mean the transfer of  centralism from Brussels to Strasbourg.    [FOCUS] Then your first motion in Strasbourg should not be  the change of its name, but its abolition.    [Brunner] The "assembly" can be an important accompanying  factor for gradual Europeanization. However, one does not need  special deputies with their own attendance fees, but can  dispatch its members from the national parliaments.    [FOCUS] Your common interests with controversial Freedom  Party of Austria [FPOe] politician Haider are causing you  problems. People left the party. Is the BfB drifting to the  extreme right?    [Brunner] Joerg Haider was presented as a bogeyman in a  particular smart form of xenophobia. I am deploring that Erwin  Wickert and Hans Schauer left the party. They did not reproach  Haider. However, they believe that the polarization is harming  us. I see it as an advantage. One cannot win elections without  polarization.    [FOCUS] Do you declare yourself for nationalism?    [Brunner] I reject nationalism. Nationalism means for me  that a nation puts its interests above the interests of other  nations. What I declare myself for is moderate patriotism: Yes  to Europe, but not against Germany. A politician must be able  to define national interests. By the way, this is also a  prerequisite for compromise. In my speech to the British  Parliament I said that we Germans must increasingly use the  numerous agreements in substance with British politics.    It is bad for Europe and Germany that France and Germany  first agree alone on results that are presented to Great Britain  and other states. The German-French friendship has degenerated  into a policy against Great Britain, although free trade,  overall Europe, and a gradual growth of Europe are joint  German-British objectives.    [FOCUS] Will the result of the European elections have an  influence on whether the BfB will run in the Bundestag elections?    [Brunner] We will run in the Bundestag elections in any  case.    [FOCUS] ... and in the landtag elections?    [Brunner] The respective results of the European elections  in the laender will give the answer.    [FOCUS] How are you financing the election campaign?    [Brunner] By donations, above all from the medium-sized  industry. The big enterprises regard European unification as an  opportunity to outmaneuver the medium-sized enterprises. The  promotion policy of the European Community [EC] is only aimed at  the big ones. The value-added tax clearing requires special tax  administrations in the enterprises. The new EC liability  guidelines reverse the burden of proof. Law and tax departments  and expensive indemnity insurances that only big enterprises can  afford -- all that is a program that harms medium-sized  enterprises.    [FOCUS] The BfB makes propaganda for itself as a German-mark  party. Can it really save the German mark -- perhaps together  with the Christian Social Union [CSU]?    [Brunner] The CSU is the anti-German mark party as such.  Its chairman, Theo Waigel, confirmed the automatism for the  abolition of the German mark with his signature in Maastricht as  the FRG finance minister. With my complaint, I forced the FRG  Constitutional Court's ruling that rejects this automatism.</p>

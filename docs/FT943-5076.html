			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / People: Hampson powers onwards Chris Hampson, former director of Imperial Chemical Industries, is to become chairman of Yorkshire Electricity in the latest appointment of a relative outsider to one of the power industry's top jobs. He is taking over from John Tysoe, who steps down in October after nearly 30 years in electricity. Hampson's appointment follows that of Sir Bob Reid, British Rail chairman, as chair at London Electricity, and Nigel Rudd, chairman at conglomerate Williams Holdings, as chairman at East Midlands Electricity. Most chief executives at the 12 regional electricity companies have come up through the ranks, but relative newcomers include Mike Hughes at Midlands and John Devaney at Eastern. Hampson joined Yorkshire's board earlier this year as a non-executive director, after a career with ICI including spells in Canada and Australia.</p>

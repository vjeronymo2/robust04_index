			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Dumitru Popa, director general of Romanian </F> Television, by Dan Priesz; place and date not given: "Don't  Expect Me To Make Television in My Own Image and Likeness"]    [Text] The new director of Romanian Television [TVR],  Dumitru Popa, former professor in the Faculty of Journalism in  Stefan Gheorghiu Academy, former state secretary in the  Department of Information of the Government, states that he  intends of create a politically impartial TVR. This is his  promise. However, can this promise be kept by the person who  was, up to now, the chief of government propaganda?    [Priesz] Mr. Dumitru Popa, you are in a very "hot" seat. Do  you consider yourselves appointed by an interim statute or a  permanent one?    [Popa] I consider it to be a provisional position in which  the evolution of the law places me. When the law on the  organization and operation of the TVR company appears, the  election of the director general and of other persons in the  leadership will be organized in accordance with the law. My  situation, and, if you will, my luck, is that I am in a  temporary situation. I could measure my efforts and escape "with  my life" from this very difficult, but not unbearable, position.    [Priesz] What was the official mandate with which the prime  minister invested you?    [Popa] The decision of the prime minister specifies a  mandate  which lasts until the publication and application of the law.    [Priesz] After that date, would you be willing to remain  director general of TVR?    [Popa] I took the position for this period, with a contented  conscience. I believe that the interim period will probably last  a month or two. I hope that Parliament will hurry to adopt the  law. I do not think that I will continue.... Each person has his  chance. A person's chances do not depend only on hierarchies but  also on an interior life, on cultural and moral options.    [Preisz] What, do you think, are your special traits which  caused you to be preferred by the prime minister at the present  time?    [Popa] It is hard for me to talk about myself. I believe  that  I have a special trait. It could be balance. I am not a  political employee; I am not a member of any political party.  Thus, I have to say that I would like TVR to be an apolitical  and credible public service. But these issues of content take  shape with great difficulty.    [Priesz] Did you ever work in the audiovisual field?    [Popa] Not directly....    [Priesz] Don't you think this is an obstacle to  understanding  the operations of this institution?    [Popa] In the Faculty of Journalism, we had laboratories  dealing with this field. I am sure that this medium is not  absolutely foreign to me, but I cannot say that I would be able  to give precise, concrete technical guidance to my colleagues  here. Probably I would not be able to....    [Preisz] What do you think about the fact that you were  appointed from outside TVR?    [Popa] Outside TVR, but I am lucky that I am not from  outside  the press.... If you note carefully, very rarely is anyone from  the press appointed to the job. I would like to say something in  all honesty. I believe in the professionalism of the people in  TVR and in my own professionalism, in general. My work principle  will be not to do alone what I cannot resolve alone. Therefore,  I have to have some support, an adviser, an exchange of thoughts  and ideas on what we should present to the public. Professional  discussion in TVR will become a work method. When we have any  doubts, we will consult at least two or three people. This seems  to me to be normal and natural.    [Priesz] The board of directors of TVR, in its present form,  was critcized, along with the way in which Mr. Everac ran it.  What is your relationship to him, in this context?    [Popa] In all honesty, I must tell you that -- at this time  -- I do not have a full response. So far, I have met with the  members of the Board of Directors. I already knew quite a few of  them. The meeting was absolutely normal. This week I will delve  more deeply into matters and will see what the situation is. So  far, I have not seen anything which indicates disfunctionality  or disharmony on the Board. It seems to me that, up to now, what  you said was true.... I do not have complete information yet but  that moment, the moment of the resignations, was a moment like  so many others. However, I have confidence in the TVR people, in  their choices and comments, in all the areas of activity of TVR.  It will be natural for me to delve into the problems and to  receive all the comments. Do not expect me to make television in  my image and likeness, to conform to my views.    [Preisz] What is the status of resignations from the Board?    [Popa] I cannot give you a precise answer. I do not know  exactly what has happened or who has reconsidered his signature.  I will be concerned about this, if necessary. But, I believe  that it is a matter of something in the past...    [Priesz] You were a professor at Stefan Gheorghiu Academy.  Are you marked by this period?    [Popa] Up to now, I have not spoken publicly about what is  called the period as "professor at Stefan Gheorghiu". I do not  want to exonerate myself, in any way. Of course, we cannot  compare the situation in the Faculty of Journalism to that in  other faculties. However, there were some aspects of  conditioning. The most important was that there were some  students who were recruited in advance by the publications and  who received a scholarship.    [Preisz] Mr. Popa, don't forget the essential criterion! --  that of unconditional subservience to the ruling elite of the  Romanian Communist Party!    [Popa] The most rigorous political criteria were  introduced... More rigorous than those in the faculties of law  or philosophy. We had students who were simple members of the  Union of Communist Youth or party members. There was no problem.  Of course, at a given moment, a certain type of candidate was in  the majority. At least formally, it was a state faculty....    [Preisz] Recently, as head of the Government's Department of  Information, you learned about the "documentary" of the evening  of 30 December? In your official capacity in the Department,  should or shouldn't you have learned about the intention to  produce and show such a film which members of the executive  organ subsequently officially withdrew?    [Popa] I don't know anything about the 30 December  documentary. Indeed, the prime minister could never have known  about the existence of the images, about the possibility of  producing this documentary and its possible showing. There was  no official order from the government to make such a  documentary. Heaven forbid! It was said and it was explained  that, in fact, the Government Studio had the contribution since  it was made there. On the other hand, it was not necessary for  me to know about the existence of this documentary...    [Preisz] As director general of Romanian Television, have  you  been asked to show the entire film on the execution of Marshal  Antonescu?    [Popa] Currently, I do not know of any intention to show  this  documentary. I believe that such documentaries, with such an  importance and such effects in history, should be seen by  everybody. The problem is the need to put them in the given  historic context and not to charge them with political burdens  and tasks. As for the 30 December documentary, I think that,  from what I have seen of it, it has a polemical character.    [Preisz] Mr. Popa, the leadership of TVR is accused of  censorship -- by Mr. George Borcescu, producer of broadcasts in  the Social Editorial Staff of TVR -- for failing to show the  film "Punct de ruptura" [Breaking Point]. Exactly what is the  background of the last-minute withdrawal of this material?    [Popa] It is a simple problem and it should be treated this  way. I know that ROMANIA LIBERA is a newspaper which is somewhat  provocative but there was no intention to stop the showing of  this film. On Wednesday evening, President Iliescu met with the  leaders of the Romanian Democratic Convention [CDR]. This moment  put relations, political consultations, and constructive  attitudes in a different light. It was considered that a  "Special Edition," dealing with the consultations at Cotroceni,  was absolutely necessary to mark this moment.    [Preisz] But why was the "marking" of this moment done in  the  time period set for a film produced by one of the "inconvenient"  producers of TVR?    [Popa] I believe that, in the given context, such a  documentary would have produced unexpected effects and, perhaps,  disservices to the parties carrying on the dialog at Cotroceni.  I did not see this documentary but, if the description in  ROMANIA LIBERA is accurate, we can even speak about disservices  which the CDR, itself, might have brought about. However, things  have to be analyzed with lucidity. You can imagine how difficult  it is to present a broadcast in which the political stake does  not determine the commentary and the editing.... This is the  most difficult thing which I am proposing: Romanian Television  will become apolitical. Returning to the documentary, the things  written in the article about Dionisie Sincan are true. But I do  not think that Mr. Sincan deserves treatment from the censor  since the issue should be treated simply as a professional one.  We discussed the opportuneness of showing the film at this time  and not the prohibition on showing it on the television station.  It is possible that it will continue to be shown. The discussion  was not about prohibition or censorship but about timeliness.  These things happen and they are discussed in every institution  of the mass media.</p>

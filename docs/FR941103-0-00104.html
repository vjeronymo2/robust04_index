			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Commenters stated that in the general rollover damage protection requirements, in paragraph (c), the wording ``enclosed inside'' could be misunderstood to require that closures and fittings must be protected from rollover damage on all sides_front, sides, rear and top. They also suggested that the protection devices be located no more than 48 inches from the closure or fitting. RSPA never intended to require that the component being protected be fully enclosed by the protective device. Also, RSPA does not agree with adding a dimensional location requirement. Rather than dimensional controls, one of RSPA's overall objectives is to provide performance requirements when appropriate. Therefore, paragraph (c) is revised to clarify the ambiguous wording.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commenters requested that in paragraph (c)(1), the tangential design load for rollover protection be reduced from 2 ``g'' to 0.5 ``g'' or 1 ``g.'' A commenter stated that ``neither industry nor government have any data to support what this rollover protection device strength should be'', contending that MC 306 accident damage protection has performed well, even considering findings of the NTSB study of overturn accidents. A commenter provided analytical data that indicated the internal bulkheads would be overstressed under 2 ``g'' tangential loads using the current MC 306 design.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A February 4, 1992 NTSB investigation report on rollover accidents involving MC 306 and MC 312 cargo tanks recommended several actions by both RSPA and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). The NTSB report supported the earlier RSPA decision to increase the rollover design load in the horizontal plane from one-half the weight of the loaded cargo tank motor vehicle prescribed in the MC 306, MC 307 and MC 312 specifications, to twice the weight of the loaded cargo tank motor vehicle prescribed in the DOT 406, DOT 407 and DOT 412 specifications. NTSB also noted that at this time, test results are not available to support this four-fold increase, but limited testing performed under RSPA and FHWA sponsorship for studies of release from dome covers indicate forces can easily exceed 2 ``g''. Additionally, NTSB questioned whether the load specified for the DOT 406, DOT 407 and DOT 412 specifications are adequate in a typical rollover accident.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> RSPA agrees with comments that in some rollover accidents, cargo tank rotation is limited to 120 degrees or less, so that these horizontal forces do not come into play unless a roadside obstacle is struck. In such incidents, the side of the cargo tank absorbs most of the energy of the rollover. However, in other rollover incidents, cargo tank motor vehicles have rotated 180 degrees or more and rollover protection devices have failed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> RSPA performed simple calculations to estimate the forces that would be expected to bring a sliding overturned cargo tank motor vehicle to a halt, at a variety of speeds and stopping distances. From the calculations performed regarding stopping distances, RSPA concludes that the design loads should not be decreased. FHWA will initiate a study aimed at developing a more refined understanding of the forces involved in cargo tank rollover accidents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

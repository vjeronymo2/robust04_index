"Regardless of whether (the weapon) is a high-caliber  weapon,  civilians are prohibited from having high-caliber weapons in  residences," the official said.    Oswaldo Fernandez, director of the National Police, charged  on 12 January it is "illegal" for U.S. soldiers or any citizen  to have high-caliber weapons in their homes.    The PTJ director expressed concern in the wake of the  killing  and suicide that took place at the Campo Lindbergh housing area  on 8 January where a U.S. soldier shot and killed his wife with  a rifle and later committed suicide by shooting himself in the  head.    Foreign Minister Jose Raul Mulino said that if he gets a  formal request from the police director, he will speak with  Ambassador Deane Hinton to request that the Southern Command  issue regulations to its troops on the possession of weapons.    The PTJ chief explained that once a weapon is seized and an  individual is detained, he is then subject to proceedings  according to the Canal Treaties. The liaison agents are then  contacted.    Quincleiton Mora, division chief of the Arms Permit Division  of the PTJ, said it is completely illegal for U.S. military  personnel based in Panama to carry firearms outside their  respective work stations.    The PTJ official explained that the existing regulation on  the issue of firearms prohibits foreign military personnel from  carrying high-caliber weapons outside their work stations.    Mora said his office is not granting arms permits to U.S.  soldiers in the country and "especially not if it involves  weapons that can cause much destruction."    Mora said that during the electoral period the sale,  exportation, and issue of firearms will be suspended to avert  dangerous situations.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The entire Bugesera region is now in the hands of  the Rwandan Patriotic Front. However, before it came under the  control of the Rwandan Patriotic Army [RPA], the government  Army, backed by Interahamwe Republican National Movement for  Democracy and Development [MRND] militias had taken care to  exterminate the whole population of the region, especially  members of the Tutsi ethnic group as is the case in other areas  under their control. Several communal graves, which were  carefully prepared in advance, have been discovered by RPF  combatants. The natural (?cave) of (Vayanga) also contained a  large number of corpses which were thrown there by men of the  current government.    And it is sad that neither French President Francois  Mitterrand, nor UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, nor  his staff member Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh on a mission in our  country for Rwandans' sins, none of these three men [word  indistinct] makes any comment on this sheer horror. On the  contrary, the first one armed and trained the neo-Nazi killers  who have just committed an irreparable act; the second, through  the third one, withdrew UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda [UNAMIR]  forces which were protecting the unfortunate people, giving the  barbarous militias the freedom to kill. None of these three men  cares about the crimes which the militias of the current  government and the soldiers continue to perpetrate.    You have no doubt listened to the words of Mr. Theodore  Sindikubwabo, puppet president of Rwanda, a statement which he  made yesterday in Kibuye where he was on a visit to express  satisfaction over the genocide which has just been committed in  that prefecture. He thanked the killers before indicating that  the troubles had ended because the people to be killed had  indeed all been killed.    Mr. Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh is in Rwanda and does not say a  single word about these government crimes. On the contrary, the  government is encouraged by the UN secretary general's  representative and by French President Francois Mitterrand who  is trying desperately to have this government recognized. This  government is in a shaky state after having committed genocide  unprecedented on this earth.</p>

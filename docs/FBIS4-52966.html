			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] Economists and political theorists are not  truthful. They work in certain circumstances, but not in others.  This is why Western-style democracy and free market enterprises  do not harmoniously guarantee a national success. It differs  from country to country. China is one of them. As Prime  Minister Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed pointed out in Beijing,  the country has its own political and economic agenda. So far,  it has worked for the country which is grappling with a  population in excess of 1.2 billion people. Therefore, to bring  prosperity to all its people is a tall order. Absolute  democracy based on Western standards is not practical in China.  Neither is a completely free market economy. Russia is a prime  example of how capitalism after the scrapping of a centrally  planned economy has failed. China does not want to suffer a  similar fate. Its economy is a dome of a free enterprise  coupled with socialist elements. In this way, it guarantees the  distribution of wealth to the people. At the same time, the  country realizes it needs foreign markets. So, it opens its own  market to foreign enterprises while making inroads into to  others.    This is what Southeast Asian countries have a lot to gain.  China offers a huge market potential. Rather than harboring  fears about its alleged military aggression, it is time to look  to China as a valuable business partner. But China has to  reassure others that it is not bent on a military conquest. A  recent report that the country was building up its military  facilities is indeed disturbing. This is compounded by  overlapping claims on certain territories. Without doubt, flash  points do exist. But in the overall scheme of things, China,  too, has to trade with Southeast Asian countries. It is the  interdependent relationship that China would not want to  jeopardize through unwarranted military exploits. If that is all  China is keen to assert, then such a picture has been painted by  the Western powers. After all, Western powers believe  self-preservation can only be achieved through military  expansion. This is not the case in this part of the world. For  business to succeed, a country needs order. Otherwise, it will  lead to a weak government and discourage foreign investment.  That is what China has set out to do for there is a massive  potential for all through greater economic interaction. Even  without China's potential not fully exploited [as heard], the  Asia-Pacific region has emerged as the fastest growth area in  the world. What more if the huge potential in China is  harnessed? This is unimaginable given China's potentially vast  market. Most importantly, it can be the engine of growth for  this region first and perhaps the rest of the world.    Malaysia recognizes China's huge economic potential and the  vital role it can play. It has already embarked on enhancing  two-way trade and investment with China. Numerous Malaysian  companies are penetrating the huge Chinese market. In return,  many Chinese companies are looking into trade and investment in  Malaysia. Malaysia's move is, therefore, a step in the right  direction in its approach toward China. Malaysia welcomes a  wealthy and prosperous China, knowing very well its [word  indistinct] benefit would be far-reaching.</p>

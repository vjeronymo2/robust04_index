			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Biggest gold find yet reported in Venezuela CANADA'S PLACER Dome has identified 150 tonnes (about 4.8m troy ounces) of proven reserves of gold in Venezuela's traditional gold mining zone, according to a report published yesterday in Economia Hoy, a Caracas newspaper. The report, which could not be confirmed immediately, said that the newly-identified reserves lay in a mining concession called Las Cristinas that Placer Dome shared with the CVG, a large industrial and mining company owned by the Venezuelan government. The concession area is to the south of the evocatively-named town of El Dorado in the south-eastern state of Bolivar, where Venezuela's gold mining activities are concentrated. Ore in the deposit holds 1.32 grammes of gold per tonne, according to the report. The deposit is about 2km long and lies at a depth of some 200m. It was found after two years of prospecting and investment outlays of about USDollars 10m. Depending on the extraction technique used, Placer Dome could produce up to 15 tonnes a year, the report said. That would far outstrip production by the government's gold mining company, Minerven, which reached just over 2 tonnes last year. Venezuela's great potential for gold has been well known for many years, but large-scale commercial development of both subterranean and sedimentary deposits has been delayed, usually because of concerns over the legal status of concessions, outdated mining laws and tax issues, among other reasons. Shares in Samantha Gold were suspended at the company's request yesterday after the Western Australian gold mining company reported a new gold discovery at its main Higginsville prospect, to the east of Pioneer Dome, writes Nikki Tait in Sydney. Samantha said that follow-up drilling in its joint venture with Geographe Resources and Great Southern Mines was obtaining 'very significant' results. It commented that assay results indicated 'very strong values over the 80m strike length tested to date, with wide mineralisation widths'. The company added that these initial results indicated the first significant gold discovery on that side of the Pioneer Dome site. 'The drill intersections are the best that Samantha has encountered since it commenced operations at Higginsville and the new tenement areas are considered to have substantial potential for further discoveries,' it said. The company's shares are expected to start trading again today.</p>

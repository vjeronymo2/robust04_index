			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Freedom Front leader General Constand </F> Viljoen by Freek Robinson on the "Agenda" program--live]    [Text] [Robinson] Good evening. The recently established  Freedom Front unveiled its election manifesto on Monday [28  March]. Tonight we have with us in the studio the leader of the  party, General Constand Viljoen, to discuss the issue. Welcome,  General. We have discussed the election manifestos of several  parties, but I see yours is rather brief, so it indicates that  you have worked quickly to get all this together. The essence  of this, as I see it, is that you desire a confederal system, an  independent homeland -- fully independent. Is that correct?    [Viljoen] What do you mean by fully independent? I do not  think you are interpreting the matter correctly. You are  correct when you say....    [Robinson, interrupting] Constitutionally speaking,  confederation means that the states are separate, but  independent.    [Viljoen] Look, if you say a confederal or a strong federal  system, if you talk about political independence, then we agree.  Economically, we cannot be fully independent. That we know. We  are economically interwoven. So we are actually concerned about  freedom. It concerns the freedom of the nations in South  Africa. It concerns a political system that prevents domination  over groups in South Africa from occurring again.    [Robinson] But do you want to establish a strong local  government -- a homeland, a strong federal state within  specified borders? Is that so?    [Viljoen] No, let us talk about the homeland issue. We have  stated this very clearly for a long time now. We know that this  homeland of ours will be economically dependent on the new South  Africa. Our farmers still want to sell their things there. We  will have to make use of the same electrical power distribution  system, and so on. Economically, we will have to work very  closely with the new South Africa, but politically we want to be  free. This means that the central authority should not be able  to dominate us, concerning political decisions.    [Robinson] But what about foreign affairs? What about  defense?    [Viljoen] I will come to that soon. By saying that we don't  want to be dominated I mean, first, we want the right to write  our own constitution, and second, we want the right to amend  that constitution. We don't want to be prescribed to on what to  include in that constitution and how to amend it. If we decide  to give the function of foreign affairs to the central  authority, that is our right. This is one of the issues we have  considered in the Volksfront [National Front], and we say that  this homeland of ours will most probably delegate its foreign  affairs function to the central authority. Certain aspects of  this -- for example, agriculture -- we think that if  agricultural attaches have to be appointed overseas then we  think that the homeland will be the one to appoint these  agricultural attaches at South African embassies overseas. That  is one of the issues. Policing is a function we believe rests  with the homeland -- territorial defense, almost like the system  in Switzerland, where the territory will have specified powers.    [Robinson] For a defense force or for a police force?    [Viljoen] No, for a territorial defense force. The central  authority, however, will have the responsibility of national  defense. This means that if southern Africa is attacked, the  central authority will establish a defense mechanism or a  defense headquarters to control the more sophisticated, the more  professional parts of the defense force, and who will then ask  for the various states to supply manpower to carry out the real  task at national level. In other words, what I want to tell  you....    [Robinson, interrupting] But why do you want the local  force?    [Viljoen] This is extremely important in South Africa in the  future, so that we do not give communities the perception that  they will be defenseless in the new South Africa. For this  reason it is important for the Afrikaner to preserve its  commando system for a considerable period after the 27 April, so  that the Afrikaner does not feel he is completely defenseless.  You know, the commando system is an absolutely integral part of  our culture. In this respect it is important that we not give  the Afrikaner a culture shock, and that we ensure the continued  existence of the commando system, since it will form the nucleus  of the future territorial defense force for the homeland.    [Robinson] But then, General, one could argue that one would  have different states, each with its own territorial force, as  you say, a sort of defense force.    [Viljoen] Yes, why not?    [Robinson] But then it could happen that they will be  constant conflict with each other, that they will fight against  each other.    [Viljoen] No, such a force serves as a deterrent and if it  is  responsibly applied then it is actually a force that ensures  peace. There is an old saying: If you want peace, prepare for  war. Now in South Africa's future, it would lead to chaos if  you create a situation where either the central authority or  other provinces are able to act against, the homeland for  example, without the homeland having the ability to defend  itself. We must accept that in the future there will be a need  for such a force. I call it a balancing of forces -- through  the creation of forces to serve as a deterrent and as a  guarantee --to provide a feeling of security for the Afrikaners  in that area.    [Robinson] General, but it is stated in newspapers that  your involvement in the Bophuthatswana debacle was not  necessarily a success, that you did not exercise the necessary  authority, and that the army was not impressive.    [Viljoen] let me tell you a little about the Bophuthatswana  issue. I challenge another organization to mobilize 2,000  troops virtually overnight and to move into a given area, under  the leadership of the Bophuthatswana Defense Force, in support  of the Bophuthatswana Defense Force, at their request. They  were to have supplied the weapons. We had an agreement. What  was the purpose? The purpose was to assist President Mangope to  survive over the weekend, until that Monday, so that a  parliamentary session could take place on Tuesday in which they  could make decisions without any form of intimidation --  decisions forced upon them following a coup.    [Robinson] General, I don't really want to discuss  Bophuthatswana. All that I want to discuss is the issue of the  army, that that entire episode was an indication that a private  army, or the territorial army you envisage for the future, could  create problems and that there will not necessarily be the  required discipline.    [Viljoen] Look, if you are talking about discipline, we know  that there are certain levels of discipline. That is well  known. It's a pity that that incident took place because the  lack of discipline was responsible for the failure of that  exercise. If we had acted correctly, that operation would have  been successful. President Mangope's party would still be in  power today, and most probably Mr. Khoza's party would also not  have been powerless. This process has led to the elimination of  at least two other political parties, and the third political  party, the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party], is now on the way to  being eliminated, now three or four weeks before the election.    [Robinson] Let me link this discussion to another issue. If  in your homeland you delegate certain functions to the central  government, such as foreign affairs and defense, there must be  another law -- the constitution as such must be applicable to  you, for example, the Human Rights Charter -- in which there is  a fundamental principle of no discrimination. Would this, for  example, apply to your state?    [Viljoen] Freek, without doubt, we will have to do this. Can  I add that I believe that the Afrikaner -- although we are  chiefly interested in the homeland's constitution -- that the  Afrikaner will not be able to divorce himself from politics, and  especially from the constitution to be adopted by the rest of  South Africa, for the simple reason that economically, we will  have to work with those people.    [Robinson] What people?    [Viljoen] The new South Africa. Secondly, we are faced with  the problem of 50 percent, at least, of our own people, our own  Afrikaners, who will be situated outside the homeland. We  cannot desert those people and say: We have a homeland. We are  going to build that homeland and not pay attention to the others.    [Robinson] How will you pay attention to them?    [Viljoen] There is a very interesting development in  negotiations at the moment. Initially we concentrated on the  idea of a homeland. It was difficult to sell the homeland  philosophy to people. We have succeeded. It was also difficult  to convince the people about the practicality of the homeland.  I think we have succeeded in that also. There are still a few  questions concerning that, but the new development is that we  want to link the homeland to certain concentrations of  Afrikaners in the rest of the country. We could call them  community councils. The idea, for example, is to investigate  this and we are busy with final negotiations in this regard --  to investigate the possibility of linking community councils  outside the homeland, through representatives, to the people's  council of the homeland, so that the homeland's council also  ensures certain functions for the Afrikaner in the rest of South  Africa, so that we can ensure the cultural survival of the  Afrikaner. The homeland and the people's council, settled in  that area dominated by Afrikaners, will have an influence inside  and outside the area, through which we can determine the future  of the Afrikaner. This is what we want. Self-determination  means the right to determine your own future.    [Robinson] I also asked you about the whole issue of the  Human Rights Charter, discrimination. What about those people  inside such a homeland who do not want to be there?    [Viljoen] About the people who do want to be part of the  homeland -- I have often explained that we want to create a  situation where there is Afrikaner dominance. In South Africa  there is an area where Zulus dominate. There is an area where  Xhosas dominate, but there is no area where Afrikaners dominate,  for specific reasons. Research indicates the fault dates back  to 1910, and the effect of the separate development policy  actually denied Afrikaners the right to certain areas. You have  already heard the argument on the peace of Versailles -- when a  delegation of blacks and a delegation of Boers came together,  and both asked to have a say in the new South Africa. The Boers  wanted to reclaim the old Boer Republic, and the blacks asked to  be accommodated in one way or another in the constitution. Both  were rejected. We are asking now, after this election, for  certain issues concerning the Afrikaner as a nation to be  rectified. We have a right to ask for this, and defining the  area is our problem. Together with the Zulus we can ask for  self-determination, but the Afrikaner does not have an area, and  in an attempt to define these borders we will have to use the  polls to prove sufficient support and to ensure that we can  implement a people's council and also that we can determine the  distribution of Afrikaner support to put the borders of the  Afrikaner homeland down on paper.    [Robinson] I want to come back to the issue of the homeland  borders, but I want to repeat my question -- very directly. If I  am a colored and I live near Lydenburg, where you yourself live,  and I find myself as part of this homeland, will I have voting  rights? Will I have equal educational opportunities? Will  there be equal employment opportunities? Will I, as a person,  have equal legal access and the same human rights?    [Viljoen] Yes, Freek, it is no longer possible in South  Africa or the world to have a homeland or state where you do not  give people certain rights. We are busy negotiating the details  of the homeland. These issues you have referred to are actually  issues that will be referred to the homeland council, to be  negotiated on a bilateral or trilateral basis, or with the  future constitutional bodies of the new South Africa. These are  important issues. We gladly want to give those people what we  ourselves are asking for, but we do not want to create a system  where people will again oust the Afrikaner -- through squatting,  for example.    [Robinson] So you actually want them away from those areas?    [Viljoen] No, we don't want them away from those areas. We  say that we will not have any forced removal of people. If  people want to leave themselves, then they can leave. What we  actually envisage is to resettle Afrikaners in those areas, to  offer those Afrikaners who have lost their jobs through this  so-called affirmative action, an opportunity to come back to  Afrikanerdom and to build a homeland through hard labor. That  is what we have in mind.    [Robinson] I have a lot of follow-up questions, but let us  leave that for the moment. I just want to ask you the following  question. Do you approve of the map unveiled by Dr. Hartzenberg  over the weekend?    [Viljoen] This map unveiled by Dr. Hartzenberg is a  so-called  discussion map. In other words, it takes into account the  historical demands of the Afrikaner. In this regard it is  correct. Dr. Hartzenberg himself said that this is not the final  map but that it is subject to negotiation.    [Robinson] Do you accept this?    [Viljoen] On the issue of further negotiation, yes, I  definitely agree with that.    [Robinson] That this be used as a basis for negotiation?    [Viljoen] Yes, I think it can serve as basis for  negotiation.  Let me tell you this: If we look at what the Afrikaner wants --  self-determination in an independent area, in a homeland, as  well as the right to negotiate self-determination for its  people, as far as possible, in the rest of South Africa -- then  there is one more thing the Afrikaner must remember, and that is  that our demand is a reasonable one, but it must also be a  practical one. The dear Lord placed us in this country together  with other people. Those other people have certain rights, and  we also have rights.    [Robinson] The same rights or not?    [Viljoen] We say that the rights of nations, the rights we  grant to ourselves, should also be granted to others. All that  we must do now is to sort out the constitutional mess South  Africa finds itself in, to rearrange this, taking into account  all the different population groups, including the Afrikaner  nation and the other nations, as well as other people living in  the Afrikaner nation's area, people who have lived there for a  long time -- to give them these rights so that we can coexist  peacefully alongside each other in the future.    [Robinson] Do you want to say then that you will also fight  for the rights of others in this election? Will you, for  example, try to get the Inkatha vote?    [Viljoen] No, that is not want I want to do. What I want to  tell you is that the Freedom Front undertook to fight for  freedom.    [Robinson] Just for the Afrikaner?    [Viljoen] No, no. Freedom is a concept that should not only  be seen in the political context. Freedom in the true sense of  the word, and freedom which especially excludes domination.    [Robinson] But would you want blacks to vote for you?    [Viljoen] If we want....    [Robinson, interrupting] No, answer the question. Would you  want blacks to vote for you?    [Viljoen] At the moment I can't.... [pauses] I will explain  in a minute. Constitutional clause 34, says specifically that a  community should prove that they want self-determination. If I  campaign, for example, for the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] to  vote for me, then the constitutional court could turn around  after the election and say this proven support is not accurate  enough.    [Robinson] What is proven support? What number would qualify  as proven support for you?    [Viljoen] Look, if one includes a constitutional clause in a  constitution, then that clause should not only apply to the  Afrikaner but also to all other nations who want it. In other  words, we cannot say that if 500,000 people vote for a homeland  then that is proven support, because if the Indians come and say  they want self-determination then we are speaking about  different numbers.    [Robinson] But one has to arrive at some figure.    [Viljoen] If we talk about support, majority support, then  the constitutional clause would have said majority support --  that is, more than 50 percent.    [Robinson] Of Afrikaners?    [Viljoen] Of Afrikaners, yes. Of the community asking for  self-determination. If there is sufficient support then I would  say ....    [Robinson, interrupting] More than 50 percent of Afrikaners?    [Viljoen] No, more than 50 percent would be a majority of  Afrikaners. If we say sufficient support, then we would say  there should be close to 50 percent, or more than 50 percent,  but it should not be so small that it becomes laughable. Let us  say that a court might rule -- and here I don't want to predict  want a court will say -- that 30 percent or less would be  unsuitable. So one doesn't want to put forward a precise  definition of this, but I think the court will be guided by  circumstances that will surely include the size of the community  asking for self-determination, and, of those communities, how  many voted for or against the idea.    [Robinson] General, in conclusion, you were in a partnership  with several other people in right-wing politics. There were  harsh words between you and some of those people, especially  from their side. Is there division in Afrikaner ranks?    [Viljoen] Look, the Afrikaner is undivided in his struggle  for his goal. We are undivided in our struggle. We are  targeting the same eventual goal. We only differ about the  method. It is a question of, for example, of driving to  Bloemfontein via either the Kimberley route or the Kroonstad  route. It does not matter. If we differ, we have agreed to  differ, and we said we will accept the two-stream policy. We  said that we would not oppose each other because we believe that  both groups are equally honest and equally serious about the  manner in which they want to achieve self- determination.  Eventually, before reaching our goal, we will take hands again  and we will stand together again. I, for example, am still a  member of the Volksfront. I am still strongly linked to the  defense mechanisms of the Volksfront and as such, I still  associate myself with the Volksfront, but I had to establish the  Freedom Front to bring about this specific alternative and  strategy, so that there would not be any setback to the  development of a homeland, but to ensure that we can secure a  homeland as soon as possible after the 27 April.    [Robinson] General, thank you very much for your  contribution  tonight.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Charles Miller, PRESS ASSOCIATION defence correspondent] </F>   [Text] Former SAS [Special Air Service] chief Lieutenant  General Sir Mike Rose is to take command of United Nations  forces in Bosnia. He will replace Belgian Lieutenant General  Francis Briquemont, who asked to be relieved of his duties after  criticising the UN handling of the crisis. A formal UN  announcement was expected later today, said the Ministry of  Defence.    Gen Briquemont, 58, who has led the UN protection force  [UNPROFOR] since last July, has repeatedly expressed frustration  with his mandate and the lack of support. He attacked the UN  Security Council last week for setting lofty goals while failing  to send adequate numbers of troops to carry them out. "There is  a fantastic gap between all these Security Council resolutions  and the means available to execute them," he said.    He stressed that he needed at least 10,000 fresh troops to  carry out resolutions, including one to set up "safe areas"  around Muslim enclaves threatened by Bosnian Serb forces.    Gen Rose, 53, will command some 12,000 troops from a dozen  different nations in a humanitarian operation that has become  increasingly difficult to maintain because of the attitude of  all three warring factions.    Aid convoys have been deliberately halted and both the  British and French Governments have hinted they might pull out  this spring if peace is not reached.    Gen Rose, who is currently commander of the UK Field Army,  will be based at the UNPROFOR headquarters at Kiseljak midway  between Sarajevo and the main UK base at Vitez. He will be  responsible to the overall commander of UN forces across the  former Yugoslavia, French General Jean Cot.    Gen Rose, who was commissioned into the Coldstream Guards in  1964, takes over command at a time when the British are  represented by the Coldstreams. The general has spent a  significant part of his Army career working undercover with the  elite SAS. He commanded 22 SAS Regiment from 1979 to 1982  through the Iranian Embassy siege crisis and the Falklands  conflict. He masterminded the daring SAS behind-the-lines  operations in the Falklands and played a key role in negotiating  an end to the fighting with Argentine commanders. For more than  a week before the Argentine surrender, he directed a vital  operation to set up direct lines of communication with the  Argentine commander General Menendez and his staff. Once the  Argentines agreed to lay down their arms, he flew by helicopter  into Port Stanley for final negotiations with Gen Menendez.    Gen Rose's SAS experience included operations in Northern  Ireland and two years after the Falklands conflict he was  appointed to the command of 39 Infantry Brigade in Belfast. He  was then appointed Director Special Forces as the overall head  of the SAS and the Royal Marines' maritime equivalent the  Special Boat Service.    On promotion to general, he took command of the Army's  North-East District and 2nd Infantry Division. He was most  recently commandant of the Army Staff College in Camberley,  Surrey, before taking up his current appointment as commander of  the UK Field Army.</p>

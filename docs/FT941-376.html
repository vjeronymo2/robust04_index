			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Alexon warns of slower recovery Alexon shares tumbled 22 per cent to 47p as the struggling women's wear group warned that recovery would take longer than expected. Mr John Osborn, the chief executive appointed last year following a shareholders' rebellion and two profits warnings, said sales had been affected by the current economic climate and 'the sheer volume of older stock that we have sold at discounted levels'. The group had also made fewer than expected savings on overheads, reducing costs by Pounds 2m against a target of Pounds 3m. Mr Osborn said Alexon aimed to make a further Pounds 5m in overhead savings this year. The chief executive was confident, however, that the group was now on a 'much sounder footing' after a year of reorganisation and the Pounds 16.4m rights issue in August. Pre-tax losses were cut by Pounds 200,000 to Pounds 12m, on sales 3 per cent higher to Pounds 111m for the year to January 29. The deficit included exceptional charges of Pounds 4.35m (Pounds 12.1m) for rationalisation and operating losses of Pounds 2.35m from the now closed North American business. Continuing businesses returned operating losses of Pounds 8.25m, against Pounds 9.59m last time. There was no dividend and losses per share fell from 53.9p to 30.38p. Mr Osborn stressed the group's progress on reducing the stock burden, which precipitated last year's profits warnings and management reshuffle. Stocks had been cut through heavy discounting by Pounds 11m to Pounds 23.6m. Net debt had also fallen from Pounds 23m to Pounds 10.7m, representing 48 per cent of shareholders' funds. Mr Osborn said the launch of the Ann Harvey range of 16+ clothes had been successful. The brand had been extended from 20 to 38 shops as of last month. The Alexon brand had increased sales modestly, although the outlook was more difficult than had been envisaged. Eastex had performed satisfactorily.</p>

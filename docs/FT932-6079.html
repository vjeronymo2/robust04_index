			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Finance and the Family: Lloyd's plan for change sends mixed signals - Richard Lapper finds both plus and minus aspects in the insurance market's attempt to put itself back on to a profitable path WEALTHY American investors and pension fund managers alike are falling over each other to get a piece of action at Lloyd's of London - at least, that is the impression some senior managers at the troubled insurance market like to give following publication of its new business plan last month. Certainly, Lloyd's should be a more attractive home for corporate capital if  -and it remains a big if - the market's management is able to implement all the plan's main recommendations. Cost-cutting and an overhaul of management systems and structures should improve profitability. In particular, an ambitious new re-insurance scheme called NewCo is designed to seal off future investors from old US asbestosis and pollution liabilities running into billions of pounds. But what about the market's existing capital base - the 19,700 individual Names - and should individual investors who have shunned Lloyd's begin to reconsider their opposition? First, the bad news. The plan contains little to cheer several thousand Names hit so badly by losses that they have resigned already or are likely to do so later this year. Lloyd's is persisting with its efforts to negotiate an out-of-court settlement to more than a dozen legal actions and announced this week that Sir Jeremy Morse, the former chairman of Lloyds Bank, and Sir Michael Kerr, a former high court judge, had agreed to oversee preliminary work. But when Sir Michael and Sir Jeremy report in September, the odds are that the amounts on offer - which will come mainly from the errors and omissions insurance policies which cover agents against the cost of legal awards - will not be enough to dissuade some of the worst-hit Names from going to law. The plan also has some recommendations that could worry Names wealthy enough to continue, and the new re-insurance plan could prove to be costly for some of them, too. Before NewCo is established, Lloyd's will review the adequacy of reserves set aside by syndicates over the years and, where deficiencies are identified, Names could be asked for more cash. In many other respects, however, the plan contains better news. Names trading in 1993 are to be allowed to use part of their premium trust fund - into which premiums are paid - to settle past losses or use as credit for the annual solvency test, which measures the assets of Names against their liabilities. The credits or cash transferred from the trust funds will be limited to 5 per cent of Names' allocated premium limit in 1993. With 1990 losses scheduled to reach between Pounds 2.5bn and Pounds 2.8bn when Lloyd's reports its results in June, that could be an important concession. An average Name underwriting Pounds 450,000 could, therefore, set aside Pounds 22,500 from 1993 income to pay 1990 losses or meet solvency shortfalls, for example. 'It doesn't help the worst-hurt Names but it is a clever solution for those who are able to trade on,' says Robert Saunders, a Lloyd's adviser with Smith &amp; Williamson, the private bank. Looking further ahead, Lloyd's looks a much less risky investment than it has been traditionally. Already, it has modified its traditional principle of unlimited liability whereby Names are responsible for meeting all their losses, even if it means selling their homes and personal possessions. A scheme introduced last year means that the losses of all Names trading in 1993 are capped (at an amount equivalent to 80 per cent of premium limit over a four-year period). Above that limit, losses are met by Lloyd's as a whole although, if the market were to fail, liability would return to the individual Names. The business plan has modified these arrangements by allowing future Names more flexibility in choosing exactly what balance of risk and reward they want at Lloyd's. Individual Names can continue to participate on the same basis as they do now, placing 30 per cent of the amount of premium income they accept in any given year as a deposit. Names who want to place a more certain limit on any potential losses can incorporate. But they would pay a higher deposit (50 per cent of the amount they underwrite) and a higher entry fee (1.5 per cent of stamp capacity rather than 0.6 per cent) than standard Names. Since incorporated Names need a minimum capital of Pounds 1.5m, all but the most wealthy would need to join with others to form limited liability companies. Alternatively, Names can reduce their risks by taking part in a greater number of syndicates - spreading their risks through schemes known as members' agency pooling arrangments (or Mapas). In this way, Names would avoid very heavy exposure to individual syndicates performing exceptionally badly. Equally, though, 'Mapa-only' Names would miss out if a single syndicate performed especially well. Mapa-only Names need deposit only 25 rather than 30 per cent of their premium income. Very wealthy Names also have a new option. Those with liquid assets of at least Pounds 500,000 and income above a specified level can trade as high-liquidity Names, depositing only 20 per cent of their stamp capacity with Lloyd's.</p>

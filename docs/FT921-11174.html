			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Major hails UN's preventive role MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday hailed the future role of the United Nations in preventive diplomacy, as the security council approved new commitments on non-proliferation. The British prime minister also stepped up the pressure for help for the Russian economy, making it clear that in his view significant financial assistance would be needed. Mr Major said the UK and the US believed that Russian membership of the International Monetary Fund should come about as soon as possible, preferably before April, as the necessary preliminary to giving the Russians access to advice and financial assistance. He highlighted the need for a tougher stance on preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, as he announced that the UK would strengthen its own controls on materials that could be exported and used in biological warfare. The change, which will require legislation, will recast in specific terms of biological agents and toxins the present, generally phased controls. The UK team expressed particular satisfaction that the commitment in the security council declaration to members working to prevent the spread of technology related to nuclear, biological and chemical weapons. They also welcomed the commitment to take action if notified that non-proliferation safeguards had been violated, and a renewed emphasis on human rights, including the ending of apartheid. Speaking after the meeting, Mr Major emphasised that while the declaration was couched in diplomatic language it contained 'a hard cutting edge', which would enable it to be used effectively against those who failed in their obligations. 'We need to be more active in crisis prevention,' Mr Major said. 'That is just as important - if not more so - than perfecting our skills at crisis management.' In his closing speech, Mr Major warned that the world should not forget 'we need economic development and prosperity in order to achieve lasting peace and stability'.</p>

			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / Heseltine warns Tory factions over risk of split MR MICHAEL HESELTINE, trade and industry secretary, warned yesterday that the Conservative party might split if either the left or the right was allowed to feel it could dominate. His warning came as Baroness Thatcher's memoirs reopened old divides among ministers. The former prime minister's criticism of Mr John Major, in the book's official serialisation which began yesterday, is more muted then unofficial extracts had suggested. She does, however, say of his time as chancellor that 'intellectually he was drifting with the tide'. Her fiercest words are reserved for Lord Lawson, her long-serving former chancellor, and Lord Howe, her long-standing close colleague. As former ministers leapt to defend themselves against the charges, Mr Heseltine expressed regret at the nature of recent political memoirs, saying that they reflected most severely on their authors. His intervention in the debate about the future of the party came after a Conservative conference at which rightwing views seemed to be in the ascendant. Speaking on BBC Television's On The Record programme - his first interview since his heart attack in June - Mr Heseltine said that every party was a coalition of different interest groups. 'If ever you get to a stage where the left of the party or the right of the party feel they have got such power that they can pull the whole thing their way, the danger is that the bits at the other end will snap,' he warned. He also made a strong attack on a few backbench Tory MPs who were, he said, outside the mainstream of the party and far too ready to rebel against the government over any difficult decision. While sounding relaxed about the strongly Euro-sceptic tone adopted by ministers during the past week, Mr Heseltine re-emphasised the importance that must be attached to the economic and trading relationship with the rest of Europe. He also expressed opposition to the changes suggested by Lady Thatcher to prevent a sitting Conservative prime minister being challenged for the party leadership. A serious contest was forced only in extreme circumstances, he said. Lord Lawson said on BBC Radio yesterday that Lady Thatcher's failure to come to terms with her fall fuelled her search for scapegoats. He denied that he had 'taken his eye off the ball'. Lord Howe said there were many errors of fact and judgment in the extracts from the memoirs, which he would seek to correct.</p>

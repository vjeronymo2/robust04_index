			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / Boeing and Airbus partners agree to super jumbo study BOEING, the world's largest commercial jet manufacturer, and the four European Airbus consortium partners yesterday agreed to carry out a 12-month study into joint development of an 800-seat super jumbo airliner. If the feasibility study is successful, it could lead to a significant realignment in the world commercial aircraft industry and usher in a new era of air travel. But the agreement between Boeing and the four partners - Aerospatiale of France, Deutsche Aerospace, British Aerospace and Casa of Spain - is also widely regarded as a manoeuvre by both sides to ensure a leading role in any super jumbo project. Boeing and the European companies will study the demand for a double-deck airliner capable of carrying between 550 and 800 passengers over a range of 7,000 to 10,000 nautical miles. They will also examine the possibility of forming a consortium to develop and produce the super jumbo, whose research and development costs alone are expected to exceed Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.5bn). Boeing and the Airbus consortium have been studying the possibility of developing such an aircraft for three years. They agree there will not be sufficient demand to make rival super jumbo projects viable. 'Based on preliminary research, we currently believe that such a project would be too big for any one manufacturer,' Mr John Hayhurst, head of large aircraft development at Boeing, said in Seattle yesterday. 'Studies indicate there may be a need for a larger airplane around the turn of the century, but the market for such an airplane is limited,' he added. Mr Jurgen Schrempp, head of Deutsche Aerospace which has led the negotiations with Boeing, said the development of a super jumbo needed 'global collaboration'. Mr Hayhurst said Boeing was entering the feasibility study 'with a clear hope of making it a success'. It reflected a new way of doing business for Boeing which in the past has tended to adopt a do-it-alone attitude. But there is still suspicion in the European camp that Boeing is seeking to pre-empt Airbus's own plans for a super jumbo which would make further inroads into the dominance Boeing exerts in the large aircraft market with its 747 jumbo. Airbus is not part of the study. One reason widely suggested for excluding Airbus as an entity was to avoid any eventual US anti-trust objections since it is the world's second-biggest airliner manufacturer after Boeing. Another reason put forward by aerospace industry analysts is that Boeing is likely to want to retain leadership of any super jumbo project and believes this would be easier to achieve by collaborating with the individual Airbus partners rather than the European consortium itself. In spite of yesterday's agreement, Airbus and Boeing will pursue their own large aircraft studies. KLM in talks on accord with three European airlines, Page 23 USAir losses deepen, Page 26</p>

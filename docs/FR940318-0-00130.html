			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> d.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Availability of new information during review period. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  If critical new information becomes available during the review period that may influence the Agency's evaluation of a substitute, the submitter must notify the Agency about the existence of such information within ten days of receiving such data. The submitter must also inform the Agency of new studies under way, even if the results will not be available within the 90-day review period. The Agency may extend or suspend the review period depending on the type of information at issue and the stage of review. Again, this will not affect a manufacturer's ability to market a substitute 90 days after initial notification to the Agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> e.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Completion of detailed review. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Once the submission is found to be supported by adequate data, the Agency will commence a detailed evaluation of the notice. As this review proceeds, EPA may contact the submitter for additional scientific and technical information to assist in the evaluation. This will ensure that the review is completed quickly and that it reflects the best available information. Final decisions will be based on detailed analysis completed during this stage of review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> f. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  Vendor lists. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  As part of EPA's outreach and clearinghouse under SNAP, the Agency will use the SNAP determinations to compile a list of vendors for the convenience of potential users. Companies could then ask EPA to review their specific substitute, to ensure that it is covered by the listing decisions on acceptable substitutes, and to add the company to the vendor list. The Agency believes that specific information on vendors of acceptable substitutes would be useful to companies switching out of class I and II compounds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> g. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  Communication of SNAP determination. (1) SNAP determinations on 90-Day notifications. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  EPA's determinations on SNAP submissions that come as a result of the 90-day advance notification requirement will take the form of either adding substances to the list of acceptable substitutes or by proposing to add them to one of the following lists: acceptable subject to use conditions, acceptable subject to narrowed use limits, or unacceptable substitutes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Communication of SNAP determination to the submitter. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Once Agency review has been completed, the submitter will be notified in writing of the determination under SNAP. At this time, the submitter will also be informed if any restrictions are attached to the acceptability of a substitute. Following the expiration of 90 days after submitting advance notification to EPA, companies may begin sale or manufacture of a new substitute. They may continue to sell or manufacture an existing substitute through the review period, unless and until the Agency places such substitute on the list of unacceptable substitutes as a result of rulemaking. Sale or manufacture may begin and continue even if the Agency fails to reach a decision or notify the submitter of that decision within 90 days of advance notification of EPA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Communication of SNAP determination to the public. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (a) Federal Register notice. To provide the public with updated information on SNAP determinations, the Agency will publish in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  a complete list of the acceptable and unacceptable alternatives reviewed to date. This list will be published four times each year and will include recent decisions made under the SNAP program. In addition to the quarterly publications, the Agency will communicate decisions through a clearinghouse and outreach program, as discussed in the next section, as well as through the Stratospheric Ozone Protection hotline.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Outreach and clearinghouse. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Section 612(b)(4) requires the Agency to maintain a public clearinghouse of alternative chemicals, product substitutes, and alternative manufacturing processes that are available as replacements for class I and II chemicals. The clearinghouse will distribute information on substitutes that are acceptable under the SNAP program. For the convenience of companies wishing to identify substitutes, the Agency will maintain a list of vendors selling substitutes as discussed in section VII.A.3.f.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the Agency will enter data on substitutes into the Pollution Prevention Information Exchange System (PPIES) database, which is maintained by EPA's Office of Research and Development. This database contains information on numerous pollution prevention options for a wide variety of industrial sectors and chemicals. PPIES can also be accessed from a variety of other pollution prevention databases maintained by other federal agencies and industry.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Decision-Making Framework  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Decisions by substitute and use. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  As required by section 612(c), the Agency must publish a list of substitutes unacceptable under the SNAP program and a list of acceptable alternatives for specific uses. Given that environmental exposure and risk profiles can change significantly from one end-use to the next, it is essential to evaluate and list substitutes in the context of their intended use. The Agency identified a number of end-uses in each sector by which to list substitutes, and section IX provides risk management decisions for many existing substitutes in each of the principal sectors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency will be as specific as possible in listing substitutes by providing exact chemical names of substitutes. For most substitutes, a broad chemical classification (e.g., aromatic hydrocarbons, or HCFCs) is not specific enough because of differences among chemicals belonging to each of these groups. Thus, where appropriate, EPA will provide a more specific description of the substitute by application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / People: A future on other side of turf war After drifting for two years without a permanent helmsman, the agency which supervises the rapidly growing and often controversial derivatives industry in the US has now found a well-qualified new head-in-waiting. President Clinton last week said he intends to nominate 38-year-old Mary Schapiro as chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, writes Laurie Morse in Chicago. Schapiro was most recently a commissioner of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and hence on the other side of the turf wars that erupt between the rival agencies at frequent intervals. But she has also had a cosy association with the derivatives industry for most of her 14-year career. Having started an enforcement attorney for the CFTC, she quickly became executive assistant to the chairman. The bulk of her time - 9 years - was then spent as a lobbyist for the industry in her capacity as general counsel for the Futures Industry Association in Washington. And though she left the FIA in 1988, appointed by Ronald Reagan to the SEC, she has maintained her personal ties to the FIA. The relationship has served her well; her candidacy for the CFTC chair was actively encouraged by futures practitioners, who heaved a collective sigh of relief last week. Given the intense criticism aimed at the whole field recently, it might seem surprising Clinton picked an industry advocate to become its chief watchdog. But Schapiro's supporters, including Arthur Levitt, SEC chairman, argue that a detailed grasp of this dynamic corner of the financial world is essential for the position, and that Schapiro's broad experience with the SEC and CFTC will benefit the inter-agency co-operation now seen as critical for derivatives regulation. Schapiro intends to stay at the SEC until she is formally nominated to the CFTC and has Congressional confirmation to the post.</p>

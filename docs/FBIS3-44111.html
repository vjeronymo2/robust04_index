The embassies  were also evacuating non-essential staff across the border to  neighboring South Africa after fierce gunfire and mortar  exchanges yesterday between the rebel army factions. Scores of  expatriates and local families were seen fleeing Maseru. The  Education Ministry ordered schools closed today.    While life returned to relative calm in the streets after  yesterday's skirmishes, many people heeded a warning to remain  indoors broadcast over Radio Lesotho. Loyalist soldiers grouped  at Makoanyane Military Base on a hill overlooking Maseru were  seen today positioning armored vehicles on the hillside.</p>

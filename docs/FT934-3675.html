			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Stress at work 'rising sharply' Stress at work is increasing sharply and should be recognised officially as a health and safety issue, a report urged yesterday. Professor Tom Cox of Nottingham University, who prepared the report for the Health and Safety Executive, said the problem needed government recognition if employers were to tackle it effectively. The report, published ahead of HSE guidelines due out next year to help employers manage stress at work, recommended further research into the problem, along with training for employers. Recent Manchester University research showed that 90m working days a year were being lost in the UK through stress. The recommendations come as growing numbers of employees are seeking compensation from their companies for stress-related illnesses. Several test cases are due before the courts. In one, a former City worker alleges that her 10- to 15-hour day caused a mental breakdown. Another employee claims stress through overwork led to a gynaecological disorder, while a production manager says staff shortages led to illness through overwork. According to one of Britain's leading stress counsellors, the problem is growing more acute as companies emerge from recession with smaller workforces and leaner managements. Mr Alistair Anderson, managing director of Personal Performance Consultants UK, said he had noticed a disturbing number of suicides involving work pressures.</p>

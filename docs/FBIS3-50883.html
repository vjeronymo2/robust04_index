			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Mexico City, 9 Jan (AFP) -- Mexican journalist  Julio Scherer, director of the PROCESO weekly, today declined an  invitation from the Zapatista National Liberation Army (EZLN) to  mediate an eventual dialogue with the government.    In today's edition of PROCESO, Scherer said: "I appreciate  the inclusion of my name with those of Bishop Samuel Ruiz and  Ms. Rigoberta Menchu," the other two persons proposed by the  EZLN.    "However, as a journalist I am committed to impartiality,  which would be difficult for me to maintain in a double role as  mediator and reporter of the events we are experiencing," said  Scherer.    "Thus I must exclusively fulfill the rules of my  profession,"  he concluded.    Today Samuel Ruiz, bishop of San Cristobal de Las Casas,  announced in his homily that he accepted the offer to try to  mediate the dialogue proposed by the EZLN, whereas the answer is  yet to come from Menchu, a Guatemalan Indian who received the  Nobel Peace Price in 1992.    In the same edition, PROCESO disclosed that the EZLN had  asked the three to "respond publicly to our proposal and, if the  response is positive, mediate in this dialogue between the  struggling poor people and their hangmen. For that purpose you  are invited to the EZLN General Command in Lacandona jungle,  where you will always be well received and protected so you can  receive our proposals in writing."    [Hamburg DPA in Spanish at 2032 GMT on 9 January 94 adds  that  Rigoberta Menchu has "confirmed today her willingness to accept  the role of mediator in the conflict, although she expressed the  need to first know the responses from Ruiz and Scherer and to  have guaranteed approval from Mexican President Carlos Salinas  de Gortari."]</p>

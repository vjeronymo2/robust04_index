			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Saunders 'has case' to fight charges Mr Ernest Saunders, the former Guinness chairman convicted of fraud over the company's 1986 takeover of Distillers, has won the first round of his attempt to use European law to challenge his prosecution, John Mason writes. The European Commission on Human Rights has ruled that Mr Saunders has a partially admissible case. Mr Saunders is claiming he was denied a fair hearing at his trial because the prosecution used evidence against him which was gained from his interviews with Department of Trade and Industry inspectors. During these interviews he was compelled to answer questions. He claims the use of transcripts during his trial therefore infringed provisions in the European Convention on Human Rights which protects against self-incrimination.</p>

			<p><P> April 19, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> THE HIGH SCHOOLS;  </P> <P> BIRMINGHAM TRIES NOVEL APPROACH  </P> <P> Who says that baseball and literature don't mix?  </P> <P> They do at Birmingham High, where Coach Wayne Sink read to his team Monday at  practice.  </P> <P> Reading? At baseball practice? You'd think the only printed word on the diamond  would be the lineup card.  </P> <P> But it's not as strange as it might sound. Sink wasn't reading Shakespearean  sonnets. He was reading from David Halberstam's latest book, "The Summer of  '49," a chronicle of the pennant race between the Boston Red Sox and the New  York Yankees in 1949.  </P> <P> Of particular interest, said Sink, was a passage in which veterans of the  proud, tradition-laden Yankees browbeat 22-year-old Yogi Berra for loafing  after he hit a popup. Sink also wanted his players to hear a passage in which  an injured Joe DiMaggio, after playing both ends of a doubleheader, asked aloud  how Berra, a fresh-legged rookie, could beg out of catching the second game.  </P> <P> "There's something to be learned," Sink said. "There was an ethic there. There  was a real dedication to work."  </P> <P> With six Valley Pac-8 Conference games left and Birmingham leading the  Mid-Valley League, Sink is hoping that the spring of '90 will prove worth  chronicling in the annals of school history.  </P> <P> Timely addition: Heath McElwee, who transferred to Granada Hills from L. A.  Baptist a month ago, has been inserted into the Highlanders' pitching rotation  after a strong showing in the Holt-Goodman tournament last week.  </P> <P> In two appearances, McElwee, a sophomore, allowed one earned run in seven  innings and was three for seven at the plate.  </P> <P> Utility man: Need an explanation for Poly's 14-3 record?  </P> <P> Consider the play of Rodrigo Dorame, a runaway winner for the team's Mr.  Versatile Award if they choose to give one.  </P> <P> Dorame is leading the team with 20 runs batted in and was batting .412 with 21  hits in 51 at-bats before Wednesday's win over Reseda.  </P> <P> While those contributions might seem more than enough to please Coach Jerry  Cord, Dorame, a right fielder and designated-hitter, also is the No. 2 starting  pitcher in a two-man rotation. Dorame, a junior, is 3-0 with a 2.30 earned-run  average in 24 1/3 innings.  </P> <P> Royal watch: Edward Smith, a transfer from El Paso, Tex., made his pitching  debut for Royal last week in the Chino tournament. Smith, a 6-foot, 185-pound  senior right-hander, hadn't pitched in almost two months but allowed just five  hits in four innings.  </P> <P> "At times, he blew the ball by people," Coach Dan Maye said. "But you could  tell he was a little rusty. His pitches were barely missing."  </P> <P> Smith started Wednesday against Simi Valley, working six innings in a 6-4 loss.  He gave up seven hits and five walks but struck out six.  </P> <P> Ineligible: North Hollywood, making a run for second place in the East Valley  League, will do so without the services of starting center fielder Duane  Braxton and first baseman Craig White, both of whom are academically  ineligible.  </P> <P> Braxton was hitting .428 with a home run and five RBIs.  </P> <P> Staff writers Steve Elling, Brian Murphy and Jeff Riley contributed to this  notebook.  </P></p>

			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Observer: Own goal Sprint had better get a move on. The US long-distance phone company thought it had its eye on the ball when it sent a 24-page booklet extolling its services to journalists covering what it calls 'the world's greatest sporting event' - football's World Cup to be held in the US this summer. 'As you make your preparations,' it said, 'you may not be thinking about things as simple as phone calls. We are.' Not enough, unfortunately. Nowhere in all the bumf was there a contact phone or fax number.</p>

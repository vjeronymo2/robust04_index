			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Kingfisher hit Management changes at B&amp;Q, the home improvement subsidiary of Kingfisher, unnerved the market and shares in the parent group fell 10 to 587p. Kingfisher, denying an earlier market story that the entire B&amp;Q management had defected to the rival Do It All camp, said the three B&amp;Q directors involved had all transferred to other positions within the group as part of the group's 'normal developmental changes.' However, some analysts took the moves as a sign that all was not well at B&amp;Q amid talk of continuing tough trading in the DIY market. Sentiment was also said to be marred by disappointing French retail figures in respect of Darty, Kingfisher's electrical retail subsidiary.</p>

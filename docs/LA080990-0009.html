			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OJAI;  </P> <P> CONDITIONS PUT ON PLAN TO EXPAND  </P> <P> A business that wants to enlarge a building in downtown Ojai should be required  to build showers for cyclists, install 30 bicycle parking slots and contribute  $5,000 to the Ojai Trolley, city planners say.  </P> <P> The owners of a building in the Arcade district on Ojai Avenue want to add a  second story to the former site of a gift shop and a beauty supply store. But  because there is no vacant land nearby they can't provide parking spaces for  the traffic that added office space would generate, Planning Director William  Prince said.  </P> <P> Planners propose that the owners also pay the city $41,000, submit an employee  car-pool incentive plan and arrange workers' schedules so they do not  correspond with rush-hour traffic.  </P> <P> The conditions are open to public review through Aug. 31.  </P> <P> "We're agreeable to it," said Larry Wilde, an Ojai real estate broker and one  of three partners proposing the expansion.  </P> <P> "We feel it's time that any development in the Arcade area have some formula  for parking because parking is a real issue," Wilde said. "We're just the new  kid on the block to help the city create one."  </P> <P> Shoppers, employees and tourists now compete for the limited number of parking  spaces in downtown lots and along both sides of Ojai Avenue, a two-lane stretch  of California 150 that serves as the main street through town. The  Mission-style Arcade houses 13 shops along the avenue.  </P> <P> Prince said the city modeled its conditions on a plan Santa Barbara used to  provide parking for its new El Paseo Mall.  </P> <P> "It's an experiment with a specific project," Prince said. "But I think it's a  step forward in the direction of a more specific parking management plan for  the city."  </P> <P> Ojai is considering requiring a standard fee for commercial developments that  provide no adjacent parking, he said. The fees would go into a fund to develop  more public parking lots or other programs to reduce vehicle traffic. THIA BELL  </P></p>

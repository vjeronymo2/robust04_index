Open since 1990, these exchanges are involved in the fields  of securities, metals, chemicals, grain and edible oil, motor  vehicles, petroleum, building materials, technology, coal and  farm capital.    By updating its central computer system several times, the  Shanghai stock market is able to handle 1,800 transactions per  second at present, up from only six in the past.    Officials with the Shanghai stock exchange said that nearly  eight million U.S. dollars were spent to upgrade the whole  system, which uses optical fibre communication lines to link up  exchanges of other regions.    At present, the trading of Shanghai's stocks can be carried  out in other major cities via satellite communication channels.  A nationwide securities market is in shape.    High technology has made brisk business possible.    In only three years, the daily transaction volume of the  Shanghai stock market has jumped from the original 105,000 yuan  to an average of 900 million yuan. Now more than five million  people are holding Shanghai stocks and trading at 500 markets in  different regions.    With the help of the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges,  all leading cities in the mainland, including Lhasa, capital of  the Tibet Autonomous Region, have opened stock market.    At present, the Shanghai grain and oil and metal exchanges  are also releasing and receiving market information via  satellite communications.</p>

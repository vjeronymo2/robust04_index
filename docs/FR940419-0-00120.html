			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Background and Purpose <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Marine Plastic Pollution Research and Control Act of 1987 (the Act) (Pub. L. 100&hyph;220) implements Annex V of MARPOL 73/78. Section 2107 of the Act (33 U.S.C. 1903 (b)(2)(A)) requires that the Secretary of the Department in which the Coast Guard is operating prescribe regulations which (a) require certain U.S. ``ships'' (defined in the Act to include fixed or floating platforms, as well as vessels) to maintain refuse record books and (b) specify the ships to which the regulations apply. Refuse record books will be used to document waste discharges from the ships. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Despite implementation of other Coast Guard Annex V regulations to date, large amounts of plastic continue to wash ashore, obstruct navigation, and entangle marine life. Very likely, much of this plastic was illegally discharged as garbage from ships. According to the Coast Guard's ``MARPOL Reception Facility Study,'' an informal survey of all Annex V reception facilities on the East and Gulf coasts, less than 20 percent of the vessels calling at these ports off-load garbage at a reception facility. Yet, Coast Guard boarding officers frequently find no trace of garbage, separated plastics, or incinerated ash on ships that doubtlessly generate large quantities of garbage, such as vessels on long voyages. The evidence strongly suggests that, despite current regulations, large amounts of garbage are still being discharged overboard before plastics are separated out for later disposal ashore or incineration aboard. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Though no regulation can stop a crew member intent on violating the regulation from illegally discharging garbage, certain measures can be taken to reduce the number of intentional, as well as negligent, illegal discharges. Under 33 CFR 151.63(a), the master or person in charge of a ``ship'' is made personally responsible for all discharge or disposal operations. Therefore, a requirement for the master or person in charge to maintain detailed records of each disposal operation will promote knowledge of the discharge regulations and awareness of waste handling practices on the ship, and provide a means of verifying that masters and persons in charge are carrying out their responsibilities. These records will provide a more complete and accurate source of information for boarding officers than would the recollections, over the duration of a voyage, of the master or person in charge. The Coast Guard has already identified the benefits of records by stating in 33 CFR 151.63(b)(2) that log entries indicating discharge operations may be considered by enforcement personnel in evaluating compliance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Furthermore, the Coast Guard's ``MARPOL Reception Facility Study'' states that refuse recordkeeping is critical to strengthening enforcement efforts. It is clear that the previous regulations have failed to curtail the growing pollution problem. The waste management plans required by 33 CFR 151.57, which, it was hoped, would satisfy the statutory mandate for a refuse record book, have in and of themselves produced inadequate results. It is now believed that, in conjunction with waste management plans, refuse recordkeeping will measurably improve the management of refuse aboard ships. In addition, it will provide data for evaluating this regulatory program and its effect on the environment. Coast Guard boarding officers are noting with continued frequency that foreign vessels are maintaining refuse records in order to demonstrate that they follow proper discharge procedures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to this rulemaking, the Coast Guard is pursuing adoption of an international requirement for refuse recordkeeping through the International Maritime Organization (IMO). In this regard, the Coast Guard submitted an action paper at IMO's Marine Environment Protection Committee meeting in July 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Discussion of Comments and Changes <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> I. General Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Three comments were in favor of the regulations. Of these three, one saw no problems with the rule and the other two encouraged vigorous enforcement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Coast Guard intends to vigorously enforce these regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) One comment stated that the rule would have no effect on the discharge of garbage in the marine environment since those who illegally dump would merely falsify records and continue the practice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The recording of waste disposal will aid in enforcement by identifying those ships that do not appear to have policies and disposal methods that support the records they provide. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) One comment suggested that methods other than recordkeeping be used to reduce the amount of garbage in the marine environment. Specifically, they proposed that plastic packaging materials be banned and replaced with biodegradable materials, that ship operators be required to provide garbage handling personnel, and that on board waste processing equipment be required. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These ideas may have merit and deserve future consideration. However, they are outside of the scope of this rulemaking, which is limited to implementing 33 U.S.C. 1903(b)(2)(A). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

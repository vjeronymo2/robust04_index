			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Observer: Party time for unemployed Jacob Haugaard, a 42-year-old comic satirist, is laughing all the way to the Danish parliament. Calling for uncontroversial social goods such as a following wind on cycle tracks, he is only the second independent candidate to secure election in nearly 80 years. It's a case of seventh time lucky for Haugaard and his Party of Consciously Work-shy Elements who look forward to the day when unemployment is not a mere 12.5 per cent, as now, but 75 per cent. A familiar figure in television, cinema advertising and through his one-man shows, Haugaard grabbed 23,211 votes in his Jutland constituency of Aarhus, Denmark's second-largest city. He had hoped to pull in 25,000 votes; the shortfall he ascribes to one of his least popular proposals - less sex in school staff rooms. While Haugaard promises to treat his Folketing membership as a practical joke, establishment politicians fret as to what his election says about their profession - as well they might.</p>

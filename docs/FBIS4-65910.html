			<p>BFN     [Text] Talloires, France, May 26 (AFP) -- International  negotiators were considering presenting a take-it-or-leave-it  peace plan Thursday [26 May] to Bosnia's belligerents, who are  balking at European proposals to carve-up the country, a  diplomat close to the talks said.    The diplomat said the "contact group" of European, UN, U.S.  and Russian negotiators were ready to try to impose a  territorial solution on the warring parties, presumably by  threatening to withdraw peacekeeping forces from Bosnia if the  new plan was rejected.    The diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said  closed-door negotiations which began at this French Alpine  resort on Wednesday between the contact group and Bosnia's  Croats, Moslems and Serbs "did not bring any new elements"  despite earlier reports of progress.    "Each party is sticking to their earlier position, whereby  the idea of considering a more authoritarian approach," the  source said.    He said Wednesday's talks focussed exclusively on  constitutional issues and the territorial carve-up of Bosnia.    "There was no mention of the fighting," he said.    The contact group held separate talks with each of the  Bosnian delegations representing the country's Moslems, Croats  and Serbs, the source added.    There have been no official comments on progress, but a  member of the Croat press contingent who said he had access to  the meeting reported Wednesday that the Croats and Moslems, who  have agreed to form a federation, had dropped demands for more  territory.    He said they had agreed to negotiate on the basis of a  European Union plan backed by the contact group which would  allot 51 percent of Bosnian territory to the Moslem-Croat  federation and 49 percent to the Serbs.    The Moslems and Croats now control 30 percent of the  republic's territory and were demanding 58 percent --  corresponding to the areas which had Croat and Moslem majorities  before the two-year-old war. Bosnian Serbs control the  remaining 70 percent of the territory.    France and Britain, the main providers of troops for the UN  peacekeeping operation, have warned they might pull their  soldiers out of Bosnia by the end of the year if no serious  progress is made towards restoring peace.    The talks here were to wind up Thursday and are expected to  resume in about 10 days at a location not yet announced to  prepare a conference of foreign ministers around mid-June as a  follow-up to one in Geneva on May 13.</p>

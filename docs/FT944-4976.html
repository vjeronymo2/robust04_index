			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Government warns defeat on VAT may force tax rises The government is drawing up plans to raise taxes or cut public spending if it loses today's crucial vote on value added tax. As the rebellion by Tory backbenchers showed signs of spreading at Westminster yesterday, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, warned MPs they would look 'extremely foolish' if they blocked the government's plans to lift the rate of VAT on domestic fuel from 8 to 17.5 per cent. With the result of tonight's vote too close to call, Conservative business managers were raising the prospect of a possible increase in income tax or the general rate of VAT if the government's VAT on fuel proposals were overturned. Meanwhile, Labour attempted to raise the temperature further, claiming that the rebellion was gaining momentum. As senior Tories insisted that they expected the government to win tonight's vote, Mr David Sumberg, Conservative MP for Bury South, delivered an unexpected blow by saying he would vote for Labour's motion because it would give the country, the House and the government 'the chance to think again'. Separately, Sir James Kilfedder, the lone Ulster Popular Unionist who often supports the government, confirmed that he would vote with the opposition. With the nine Ulster Unionists also set to vote with Labour unless ministers come up with what one senior MP described as a 'very powerful argument', it looked last night as if the opposition of eight Conservatives - or 15 abstentions - would be enough to defeat the government. Its majority is 14. Last night there appeared to be at least 15 Tories, including several Eurosceptics, who might either abstain or vote against the government. They included: Sir Richard Body (Holland with Boston), Sir Andrew Bowden (Brighton Kemptown), Mr Michael Carttiss (Great Yarmouth), Mr Nicholas Fairbairn (Perth and Kinross), Mr Phil Gallie (Ayr), Mr Christopher Gill (Ludlow), Mr Paul Marland (Gloucestershire West), Mr Tony Marlow (Northampton North), Mr William Powell (Corby), Mr Richard Shepherd (Aldridge-Brownhills), Mrs Ann Winterton (Congleton), Mr Nicholas Winterton (Macclesfield) and Sir Rhodes Boyson (Brent North). Tonight's vote is on a motion to reopen the issue of VAT on domestic fuel. The government would have to be defeated once more to block the increase, unless Mr Clarke changed plans before a second vote. Speaking in Brussels, Mr Clarke said a government defeat would mean only that the 'shape of the resulting Finance Bill would change'. VAT see-saw, Page 8 Observer, Page 19</p>

			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Japanese money supply continues gentle rise JAPANESE money supply continued its gentle rise last month, but at exactly the same rate as previously, further evidence of the sluggishness of demand. The broadly defined aggregate of M2 (cash in circulation and time and demand deposits) plus certificates of deposit rose by a preliminary 1.9 per cent in October, against the same month last year, the Bank of Japan said. That was the seventh monthly increase in a row, but exactly the same as the final figure recorded in September and below most economic forecasters' expectations.</p>

			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / Judgment on King's Cross overturned ST BARTHOLOMEW'S Hosp-ital and the Church of England yesterday lost the opportunity to make windfall profits of several million pounds from the proposed Pounds 4.5bn redevelopment of land around London's King's Cross station. The Court of Appeal overturned a ruling by a High Court judge two years ago that the hospital trustees and the Church commissioners had the right to buy back from British Rail and National Carriers 52 acres of prime development land at 1850s prices. The land was compulsorily purchased to make way for rail lines. Bart's surrendered 43 acres for which it was paid Pounds 53,250. The Church commissioners sold nine acres, also under compulsory-purchase powers. The land is part of the 125-acre site north of King's Cross station which has been earmarked for development which includes the Channel tunnel rail-link terminus, offices, shops, 1,350 new homes and a 35-acre park. Under the ruling, Bart's and the Church commissioners could have purchased the land at the original price of about Pounds 1,100 per acre and then sold it at a large profit. However, the Court of Appeal yesterday allowed an appeal brought by BR and National Carriers. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith said he allowed the appeal without regret. The hospital and the Church commissioners received the full value of the land in the 1850s. Bart's and the Church commissioners are to consider an appeal to the House of Lords.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast] </F>   [Text] Answering a question from a "Vesti" correspondent on  whether the resignation of Yegor Gaydar and Boris Fedorov  affects Russia's relations with its Italian partners, the  Russian prime minister, who is on an official visit to Italy,  had the following to say:    [Chernomyrdin] Absolutely no change whatsoever; I feel  absolutely none. I think that we have normal relations.  Serious people understand that the departure of one person or  another has no significance since it is not just one person, or  even two people, who implement the policy and do the work but  the entire government. We have the president, the guarantor, and  if we even move away we have someone to put things right. This  will not affect our affairs, absolutely not. It is not just  those two who worked. Everyone carries out his duties. The  government does not consist just of two people. They had their  own specific, narrow responsibilities.</p>

			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Election 1992: Stock price index moves against victory for Major THE FINAL full week of the election campaign showed the FT Election Share Index moving against a Conservative victory as stocks that might benefit if Mr John Major returns to Downing Street did much worse than those that might benefit from a Labour win. The index, published daily during the campaign, consists of 10 stocks which might outperform in the event of a Labour victory and 10 which could benefit from a Conservative win. Its performance last week reverted to that seen in the early days of the campaign, undoing the reversal of trend seen in the previous week. The big loser of the week was BET, the businesses services group, down 11.6 per cent. It is suffering from worries specific to the company's performance as well as concern that a Labour-imposed minimum wage might raise the cost of employing BET's army of service workers. Another big loser on the Tory side was SG Warburg, the merchant bank, which has been affected by concern that a Labour government might clamp down on merger activity, and hit the bank's corporate finance revenues. Its shares fell 6.9 per cent on the week, as did those of Prudential, the UK's largest life insurer. Utilities such as National Power, British Telecom and Thames Water, which dropped heavily earlier in the campaign, appeared to have absorbed most of the bad news. Last week, their decline slowed as they dropped by between 2 per cent and 4 per cent. On the Labour side, the week's big loser was Land Securities, the UK's largest property company, which fell 6.7 per cent. Though it is regarded as the strongest in its sector, the group suffered from the bad news affecting other property companies such as Olympia &amp; York, Heron and Speyhawk. The base for the index is closing prices on the day the election was announced, Wednesday March 11. Both sections are set to 100 at that date. The index is constructed on the same basis as the FT 30-share Ordinary index  -making it highly sensitive to day-to-day movements and unsuitable for long-term performance measurement. Unlike the FT-SE 100 and FT-Actuaries All-Share indices, constituents are not weighted by the relative size of the companies concerned.  ------------------------------------------------------------------                        FT ELECTION SHARE INDEX  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Labour win/Tory defeat stocks (% change since March 11) 1.

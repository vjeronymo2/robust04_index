			<p>BFN     [Text] An agreement has been reached between the government  and Marco Pannella. The latter and his supporters will now form  part of the ruling government coalition. The news was released  during a joint news conference given by Silvio Berlusconi and  Pannella. Berlusconi said that the agreement "is a visible  signal that the government is of the center." Pannella stressed  that some points of the agreement "could bind us for the entire  legislative term."    The agreement, Berlusconi stressed, is a reply to the demand  for change expressed by the country. The agreement envisions,  among other things, a single round for elections and  establishing a UN tribunal in order to try those responsible for  crimes against humanity.</p>

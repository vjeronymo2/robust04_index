			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Public Notice and Comment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Opportunities for public review and comment on Wholesale Power Rate Schedules CBR&hyph;1&hyph;C, CSI&hyph;1&hyph;C, CEK&hyph;1&hyph;C, CC&hyph;1&hyph;D, CM&hyph;1&hyph;C, CK&hyph;1&hyph;C and CTV&hyph;1&hyph;C, proposed for use during the period July 1, 1994, through June 30, 1999, were announced by Notice published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on February 7, 1994. All customers were notified by mail. A Public Information and Comment Forum was held in Nashville, Tennessee, on March 10, 1994, and written comments were invited by the Notice through May 3, 1989. Oral comments were presented at the forum and written comments were received prior to May 10, 1994. There were twelve (12) substantive comments received and all comments were evaluated. Comments and questions from four sources were received at the Public Comment Forum held in Nashville on March 10, 1994. These are included in the Forum transcripts which are included as exhibit A&hyph;4. Written comments and questions from four sources were received by mail and facsimile during the comment period and are attached. The comments were received pursuant to  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Notice 59 F.R. 5581 dated February 7, 1994. The following substantive issues contained in the comments were considered. A summary of written comments, written responses, and the oral comments follows this discussion of the substantive issues.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 1: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The allocation of the TVA transmission credit does not recognize that the schedules to outside preference customers cannot be met without the entire TVA transmission system and fails to compensate TVA for the use of its transmission facilities for the delivery of these schedules.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Lacking its own transmission system, transmission services are required from TVA to deliver capacity and energy allocations to customers outside the TVA system. Rates that have been in effect since July 1, 1989 allocate some of the TVA transmission charge to the TVA area customers. This rate design was originally proposed in order to reallocate what Southeastern viewed as an excess transmission charge by TVA. The rate design was not contested at FERC by TVA. Southeastern's rate proposal that is effective July 1, 1994 includes a $7,000,000 credit for TVA's transmission service. TVA area customers will not pay a portion of this transmission charge and the entire amount will be paid by customers outside the TVA system. This is the amount agreed to by Southeastern and TVA after weeks of negotiations subsequent to the March 10, 1994 public information and comment forum. This issue is further discussed in the Rate Adjustment Process and Design section of the Rate Order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 2: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  TVA's customers are being charged for service provided by their own system. In effect, they are paying for a portion of the TVA system twice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The issue of paying for a portion of the TVA system twice was reconciled in the negotiated settlement. Customers outside of the TVA system bear the full amount of transmission services provided by TVA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 3: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The TVA transmission cost of $12 million which was originally proposed by TVA resulted in a rate of $2 per kilowatt per month and 1 mill per kilowatt-hour. This rate is too high, not justified, and would not pass FERC scrutiny.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The negotiated settlement between Southeastern and TVA allocated reduced the transmission cost from $12 million to $7 million.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 4: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  SEPA should not include TVA's increase in their charge for transmission services in SEPA's rates until preference customers have had ample opportunity to make comments or intervene in some way.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  This objection was addressed in the negotiated rate settlement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 5: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  TVA is overcompensated on the amount of energy they get with each KW of capacity they receive.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  This comment is understood to address the Cumberland Basin Power Marketing Policy which sets forth, among other things, capacity and energy allocations in the Cumberland Basin. The Power Marketing Policy is set forth in 58 F.R. 41702 published August 5, 1993. Cumberland Basin System marketing arrangements provide all customers with 1,500 hours of energy for each kilowatt of capacity allocated by Southeastern. TVA receives 1,500 hours of energy per KW and is also allowed to purchase any residual system energy which averages 5,000 hours per KW per year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 6: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Energy should be prorated to all customers and the rate increase should be shared among all customers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Power allocation is addressed in the power marketing policy for the Cumberland system and was not addressed in this rate filing. As the result of the negotiated settlement, the transmission charge to outside customers was reduced from $12 million to $7 million per year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 7: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  East Kentucky should not pay TVA wheeling on the portion of its capacity allocation it receives at the Laurel project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Laurel Project is located in the service territory of East Kentucky Power Cooperative. All of the output of Laurel is delivered to East Kentucky and therefore no other customer receives any benefit from this project. Even though TVA does not have an interconnection with the Laurel Project bus bar, TVA has interconnections with East Kentucky that facilitate the delivery of power from elsewhere in the system to provide firming support.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

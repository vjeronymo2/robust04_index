			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed item: "It Is Good That It Is Not as Hot in </F> Crimea as It Is Surrounding It"]    [Text] "The unprecedented flirting with separatists in  Crimea has finally reached its logical conclusion," says a  statement from the Kerch organization of the Ukrainian Civic  Congress of Crimea [UHKK], which represents the interests of the  700,000 Ukrainians of Crimea.    The Kerch organization of the UHKK asserts that "a  totalitarian dictatorship based on Russian chauvinist  principles, lightly coated with general democratic rhetoric, is  now taking shape in Crimea."    The Kerch organization of the UHKK, and the Kerch  organization of the Ukrainian Republican Party that is in  solidarity with it, are demanding that official Kiev act  immediately and decisively. Any further concessions to the  separatist rebels will not only fail to appease them, but will  rather motivate them to commit further acts to make Crimea  secede from Ukraine and join Russia, the statement emphasizes.</p>

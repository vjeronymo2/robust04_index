B. Rates for cement transportation should be established at  87 percent of the 13.5 percent established by ministerial  agreement dated 1-90 of 24 May 1990 issued by the Ministry of  Communications, Transportation, and Public Works, forcing the  issuance of the respective ministerial agreement.

We will try to restore it in a few minutes, because  there seems to be a ray of hope that in the next few hours this  problem that is already exerting heavy pressure on the people  will be settled. Thus, we call on Jorge Celis to reestablish  contact, to perhaps start this report over again, because it is  interesting news. Here at our news center we are duty-bound to  bring news to all parties involved in the problem and to report  the information as it happens. [passage omitted]    Donald Gonzalez has contacted us from another location.    [Begin relay] ...government intention to intimidate the  businessmen of the country's organized transportation sector, by  this means we urge the human rights ombudsman and the  metropolitan archbishop to be on call should this organization  or its members deem this necessary at any given time.    We clarify this because at no time have or will commercial  organizations and businesses represented by this national group  participated in acts violating the law. The principle of  freedom of industries and commerce entitles us to make our own  decisions in our activities. We know, we are sure that we can  work for our country's development as long as government  officials fulfill their obligations and meet the people's  demands. We are also the people. Article 43 of the Republic's  Constitution. [as heard]    Based on the aforementioned, the National Transportation  Coordination Board, in reply to the proposal made by the  president today, and as a goodwill gesture with the sole goal of  not hurting the Guatemalan people despite the indifference of  government officials, reports the following:    A. We agree to [word indistinct] of the value of the freight  value in the adjustment of current fuel transportation rates  plus 0.5 quetzals per gallon considered as part of the insurance  expenses for that freight [words indistinct].    B. Rates for cement transportation should be established at  87 percent of the 13.5 percent established by ministerial  agreement dated 1-90 of 24 May 1990 issued by the Ministry of  Communications, Transportation, and Public Works, forcing the  issuance of the respective ministerial agreement.    The president must immediately sign the following government  agreements:    1. Extra-urban passenger transportation.    2. Ground transportation of cargo equipment in the country  [words indistinct] shipping companies.    3. Definition of the correct interpretation of Articles 61  and 64 of the Income Tax Law, decree number 26-92 of the  Congress of the Republic to the effect that transportation  companies that issue receipts authorized by the General Internal  Revenues Directorate are not subject to the 4 percent  withholding under the category of professional service.    4. Order and control of work 24 hours a day by customs and  immigration officials at national borders and ports.    5. We clarify that we do not reject liberalization of  heavy transportation because freight transportation in the  country is regulated by commercial contracts signed by mutual  agreement among the interested parties. Thus we ask the  president to try not to confuse public opinion. Moreover, as a  private sector that provides work for more than 30,000 families  throughout the country, we are not interested in more state  controls on transportation activities.    6. We want history books to record that the current  conflict reached the magnitude it has today because during the  past seven months of government, state officials closed the  doors on the country's organized transportation sector. We do  not have political interests. We never stop being and thinking  as an integral part of the Guatemalan people, and, as such, we  continue to demand solution of our problems and those of any  other segment of the population as long as inefficiency persists  in the decisionmaking process, because they stop making such  decisions at certain times. [as heard]    This group continues to be open to dialogue and negotiation  with the sole purpose of finding solutions to national problems  together. [end relay]</p>

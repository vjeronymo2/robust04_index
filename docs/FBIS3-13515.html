			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] Zionist Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin arrived in  Washington today, Monday, on an official visit to the United  States, during which he will hold talks with U.S. President Bill  Clinton, focusing primarily on the resumption of the Middle East  peace talks and ways of ending the standoff between the Zionist  entity and the PLO.    The Israeli prime minister's visit to Washington comes on  the  heels of the Zionist government's decision yesterday to outlaw  the activities of the racist, extremist Kakh and Kahana Hay  groups.    Political observers view Rabin's reported agreement to allow  nonmilitary international observers in the occupied territories  merely as a cosmetic measure to remedy the current crisis in  Arab-Israeli negotiations.    Meanwhile the UN Security Council continues its discussions  on a prospective resolution condemning the two-week-old Zionist  criminal massacre of Palestinians in Hebron. Indications show  that the United States is seeking a resolution that will not  adversely affect the peace process and, at the same time,  refrain from accusing or condemning the Zionist entity to the  extent it deserves.    It was clear from the start that Washington and Tel Aviv  were  trying hard to suggest that the Hebron crime was an act by an  individual act to relieve Tel Aviv of responsibility for it.    Although the U.S. President showed some sensitivity about  the  slaughter of Palestinians in Hebron and condemned the crime, he  still believes that the Arab-Israeli peace process is a much  more important issue. According to political experts, his  insistence on resuming the Arab and Palestinian talks with  Israel stems from the widespread anxiety that opposition to this  bargaining is growing throughout the region.    In light of the Zionist entity's character, this question  becomes necessary: Will resuming the peace process remedy the  Palestinian security problem in the occupied territories?    Judging by the Zionist entity's acts, its  settlement-building  policy, and its arming of Jewish immigrants, the answer cannot  be yes. This is particularly true because these inhuman  activities enjoy blatant U.S. support.</p>

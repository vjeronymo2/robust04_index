			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / International Company News: Time Warner rises on shake-up SHARES IN Time Warner, the large US media group, rose sharply yesterday morning as Wall Street reacted positively to a management shake-up involving the resignation in a policy dispute of Mr Nicholas Nicholas, president and heir apparent to Mr Steven Ross, the chairman. Time Warner announced Mr Nicholas's unexpected departure late on Thursday, after the closure of the New York Stock Exchange. It said he had been replaced as president and co-chief executive by Mr Gerald Levin, the group's chief operating officer. Shares in the group, which has been dogged by controversy ever since the 1989 merger between Time, the blue-chip publishing house, and Warner Communications, a much brasher film and entertainment group, stood at Dollars 100 3/4 at lunchtime, and closed at Dollars 100 for a net gain of Dollars 2 1/8 . Mr Nicholas, aged 52, had a mixed reputation on Wall Street, where he was seen as a good manager, but possibly lacking the rapport with creative artists helpful in running a media business. Despite this, Mr Nicholas had been due to succeed Mr Ross under the terms of the 1989 merger between Time and Warner Communications. Mr Ross himself is undergoing treatment for prostate cancer. Mr Levin, who is also 52, is highly regarded by brokers' analysts, who view him as a good manager with a creative touch and understanding of the film industry. In the 1970s he was closely involved in Time's development of its Home Box Office cable television channel, which specialises in showing feature films. Although both Mr Nicholas and Mr Levin are veterans of the Time side of the business, and were both closely involved in the negotiation of the controversial 1989 merger, company executives said Mr Levin had grown much closer to Mr Ross and his ideas on the group's future. Mr Nicholas gave no details of the clashes which led to his departure. He said merely that 'for a company to fulfil its potential requires a clear strategic focus shared totally by its leadership'. There was sufficient difference between himself and the management and board that his resignation should 'enable a single and consistent view to prevail'. However, company insiders suggested there had been a series of clashes between Mr Nicholas and Mr Ross over Time Warner strategy decisions. These appear to have included the terms of an agreement last autumn, under which Time Warner sold a 12.5 per cent stake in its film and cable business to Japanese companies, Toshiba and C. Itoh, for Dollars 1bn. The group has also been looking for strategic partners in Europe. They may also have involved a decision for the highly-indebted company to raise Dollars 2.7bn last year through a controversial rights issue of shares, which had to be embarrasingly restructured when it ran into investor opposition. Mr Nicholas, 52, had a mixed reputation on Wall Street, where he was seen as a good manager, but one possibly lacking a rapport with creative artists</p>

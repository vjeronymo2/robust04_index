			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Investing for Growth): Scotia Scotia Holdings is an extraordinary one-off which has based its research on the principle that fats, as well as the proteins exploited by other companies, can be turned into drugs. More than any of its rivals, it depends on one man: founder and chairman David Horrobin, a former professor of medicine in Montreal. If, one day, he wins a Nobel prize, it will be in spite of his penchant for establishing research centres in out-of-the-way places such as Nova Scotia, Canada, and the Western Isles of Scotland and managing them on the principles of Sir Karl Popper, the late philosopher of science. The company struggled to find finance in its early days and turned to the nutritional market to pay for more serious R&amp;D. It makes evening primrose oil under the Efamol brand name. Yet, today, it has more drugs in phase 3 trials than some mainstream pharmaceuticals companies.</p>

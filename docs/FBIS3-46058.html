According to statistics, Shanghai's total value of import  and exports reached $30.93 billion in real terms last year,  representing an increase of 23 percent over the previous year,  and holding a leading position among cities nationwide.    Shanghai Customs, which is responsible for supervising and  controlling goods going to and from Shanghai's port, has played  an enormous role in promoting the functional development of  Pudong New District and the Waigaoqiao Bonded Zone, supporting  Shanghai's export trade, and expediting the construction of  municipal infrastructure facilities and the development of new  hi-tech industry. Last year, they helped over 2,200  enterprises, who took care of customs declaration work  themselves, go through the formalities of customs registration  and handle tax reduction or remission procedures for 10,000  consignments with a value of $890 million, and 2.96 billion yuan  in taxes was reduced or remitted, which represents an increase  of 257 percent over the corresponding period last year.    Using the normal practices of free trade zones overseas for  reference, Shanghai Customs has successively formulated eight  measures for managing the Waigaoqiao Bonded Zone and practiced a  new model of supervision and control, which is both simple and  flexible, in the closed area of the zone, thereby achieving the  objective of handling matters within the zone and pushing  forward the comprehensive development of business in the bonded  zone. Shanghai Customs has also taken the initiative in helping  to boost Shanghai's foreign trade and vigorously broadening the  scope of business in the bonded zone. A total of 21 new bonded  factories and 34 bonded warehouses were approved last year. At  present, Shanghai boasts eight bonded groups, 187 bonded  factories, and 297 bonded warehouses, which have initially  formed a bonded zone supervisory and management system  characterized by comprehensive categories, multiple levels, and  great adaptability.</p>

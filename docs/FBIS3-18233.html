			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Giorgio Napolitano, Italian lower house </F> speaker, by Paolo Franchi; place and date not given: "`Do Not  Superimpose Politics on Justice'"]    [Text] Rome -- "The constant succession of political  polemics and judicial affairs is spurious and devious."    Giorgio Napolitano -- speaker of the lower house and the  progressive forces' candidate for Naples -- is worried, and is  not concealing the fact: "Throughout the legislative term  parliament has worked hard to support the course of justice,  helping to establish judicially significant responsibilities.  This, without violating the guarantees provided to defend both  the function of parliament and the citizens, and without  neglecting the need -- in order to begin a new phase in the life  of the Republic -- for reforms that can come only from  parliament and obviously not from the judicial authorities.  Whether or not we have been successful in this endeavor may be  a matter for discussion, but political and judicial  considerations must not be confused."    [Franchi] The fact is that nobody seems to be very clear  about how to avert this danger of superimposition....    [Napolitano] In order to guarantee the proper and calm  conduct of the election campaign there must be a great sense of  responsibility and restraint on the part of all the state  authorities and bodies. But confusion is often also avoided by  clarifying matters.    [Franchi] You are talking about the media. The only thing  that cannot be demanded of them is not to provide information,  however.    [Napolitano] Yes. But it is extraordinary, for instance,  that the existence of the so-called register of investigatees  was discovered only a few months ago and that there has been no  explanation of what it is.    [Franchi] Have you formed an idea of the reason for this  "discovery?"    [Napolitano] I think that since the abolition of the  application for authority to proceed in the case of deputies and  senators, with the reform of parliamentary immunity -- and we  are well aware of how newsworthy every such request was -- its  place as a piece of sensational news has been taken over by  disclosures about inclusion on the register. This is irregular:  That register, which the penal code significantly assigns for  information about crimes and not investigatees, automatically  includes names of persons who subsequently may very well not  receive the notice of investigation which, however, used to be  the precondition for authorization to proceed. Therefore, a  category of suspicion that was already quite inevitably  associated with the first official stage of an investigation has  been brought forward to an entirely primal level.    [Franchi] Did you know that it is rumored that your name too  is included on the register in Naples?    [Napolitano] I did not know, and it does not interest me. In  any case, the penal code forbids any communications in this  regard. I only know that I have initiated proceedings for  slander against a certain Mr. Greco for the ridiculous  fabrications that he apparently presented to the magistrate who  questioned him, and that were denied by Deputy Pomicino, whom he  himself cited as his source.    [Franchi] Leaving judicial initiatives aside, are you not  aware of a sense of disappointment among the public? Is this  really the advance of the New?    [Napolitano] Innovation does not happen overnight; an  electoral reform -- even the best -- does not produce its  positive effects immediately. What were, and what are, people's  aspirations? On the one hand, openness, political and ethical  honesty in relations between the institutions and the country,  between representatives and represented. On the other hand, a  simplification of the debate before the voters and within the  elective assemblies, in order to permit greater government  stability and efficiency. Well, progress is possible in both  areas, both now and in the near future. But there needs to be  an effort of reflection and realism on everyone's part. It must  not be forgotten that until 1992 it proved impossible to produce  even a corrective measure to the proportional system by  introducing a threshold. Each political force remained attached  to its own more or less obsolete identity; its own political,  cultural, or government stances; resisting any possible  combination with other forces.    [Franchi] Yes. But then came the scalpel of the  first-past-the-post, single-round, single-candidate system...    [Napolitano] ...And we must not be surprised if the  alignments that this system has caused to be formed more or less  hastily are proving, to a greater or lesser extent,  controversial, artificial, and subject to successive  disruptions. I mean that a first step has been taken: All  three main alignments display a common denominator, internal  difficulties, and uncertainties about the future. It will be  necessary to work patiently and responsibly to keep united that  which can reasonably unite on the left, on the right, and in the  center.    [Franchi] The single-candidate system was sought for the  sake  of selecting a political class having connections with the  ground, with the voters. Precisely the opposite is happening,  however -- recycling, the search for safe constituencies...    [Napolitano] I am worried by the fact that the political  forces have not properly understood the rationale of the  single-candidate system. But this option is destined to endure:  Other aspects of the electoral system may be revised, but not  this. It is also extraordinary that, even before the election,  so many attacks are being made on a reform approved by the  voters themselves, instead of appreciating all its potential for  change.    [Franchi] I understand that. But there is still a strong  feeling that many expectations could be disappointed. And it is  a sense of danger.    [Napolitano] This is a traumatic transition -- even chaotic,  as [Italian Popular Party (PPI) Secretary] Martinazzoli says --  because of the terrible delay with which it was begun. We must  also understand that everywhere -- from West Europe to the  United States -- democratic systems are experiencing  difficulties that are not easy to understand or to control. The  wind of antipolitics; of intolerance; and of opposition to the  parties, politicians, and parliament is not blowing in Italy  alone. And the only democratic response lies in the  regeneration of political life and of the representative  assemblies. That is, unless...    [Franchi] Unless what?    [Napolitano] Unless the voters' choices are well pondered --  and this includes the individuals concerned, their qualities,  and their real suitability for representing and governing. As a  voter, I would urge candidates standing in my constituency to  pledge, first, to attend parliament as long as debates and votes  require.    [Franchi] Mr. Speaker, you try to keep out of the fray as  far  as possible. But I would remind you that you are competing on  behalf of the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] and the  progressive forces. To return to your idea, what could remain  "reasonably united" on the left after the election?    [Napolitano] The demarcation line with the right is very  clear. I am hoping for a civilized debate also between the  progressive forces and the "pole for freedoms," but certainly  all the components of the progressive cartel identify with  certain major principles. First, the commitment to preserve,  reappraise, and strengthen social and civil gains, which are the  fruit of action over several decades on the part of the  left-wing and progressive forces and which are essential to  further democratic development. On this basis we can and must  shoulder all the burdens necessary for the reform of public  finance, to boost the economy, for reform of the institutions,  and for the country's social and ethical rebuilding.    [Franchi] But it is precisely in these fields that the  splits  are occurring.    [Napolitano] It would of course be ridiculous to deny or to  conceal the differences concerning the prospect of government,  important aspects of economic and financial policy, and even  foreign policy: Be that as it may, the voters can express their  preferences for the various stances through their votes for the  lists for the proportional quota. After the election we will  see what possible common ground exists on the controversial  issues. But we will focus on the need to formulate consistent  and feasible proposals for an alignment that intends to shoulder  government responsibilities.</p>

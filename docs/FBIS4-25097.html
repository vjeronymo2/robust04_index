			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Ruth Mathewson in Hong Kong and Geoffrey Crothall in </F> Beijing]    [Text] Exiled mainland labour leader Han Dongfang was  centre stage at Victoria Park last night as thousands of people  held a candlelight vigil to mark the fifth anniversary of the  1989 Tiananmen Square massacre. Mr Han, prevented from  returning to China last year after being released from jail and  allowed to go to the United States for medical treatment, sat in  a sea of swaying lights to address up to 12,000 people.    "The memory of flesh and the broken bones under the tanks  still awakens me from my dreams," said Han, who was later mobbed  by autograph hunters. "It is the first time that I have joined  this function, and it is the first time I can talk about my  feelings for June 4 in public. The memory of the tanks are  still painful.    "I will always remember that I am a survivor, and a survivor  has his own dreams."    Organisers of the vigil, who claimed that up to 45,000  people  attended, strode solemnly through the crowd to lay a wreath at  the feet of a replica of the Goddess of Democracy statue that  had been the focus of the student protests in Beijing.    Legislator and chairman of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support  of the Patriotic Democratic Movement in China, Szeto Wah,  discounted rumours that his organisation was about to fold.  "The struggle must continue, especially on a piece of land  which will return to China so soon," he said.    Local trade unionist, Lee Cheuk-yan, said Hong Kong people  would always remember the dead of Tiananmen even if Beijing a  put a stop to open protests after the handover. "We are very  sure people will continue to support democracy in China even  after 1997," he said. "After five years they have not a  forgotten. They will not forget after 1997, even if the  authorities at that time do not allow us to hold this sort of  activity," he said.    A small band of protesters later moved on to the Happy  Valley  headquarters of Xinhua (the New China News Agency), setting up  an altar to democracy. Police were reported to have ordered  several people to move on.    In Beijing, the heavy security seen all last week was still  apparent, but the mood in the capital appeared more relaxed as  it became clear that the fifth anniversary of the massacre would  pass without any major incident. Uniformed and plain-clothes  police were again out in force in Tiananmen Square and the  northwestern university district, but life in the city carried  on much as it would on any other Saturday. Most of the more  than 100 police officers stationed in and around Tiananmen  Square were content to sit and watch tourists pose for  photographs.    The Monument to the People's Heroes in the centre of the  square where students made their last stand five years ago was  securely roped off to everybody, except a group of primary  school children in pristine red and white young pioneers  uniforms who formed a guard of honour on the uppermost level.  Many of the tourists from outside Beijing who visited the  square seemed unaware of the significance of the day.    All the major universities in Beijing were again closed off  to unauthorised visitors and police maintained road blocks at  key intersections around the campus of Beijing University. But  the police seemed relatively relaxed, allowing several foreign  journalists into the university district but making sure no one  went on campus. The residents of the university district, which  includes Beijing's so-called Silicon Valley, did not appear  bothered. "It's nothing to do with me, why should I care if  there are police outside my door," an employee of one computer  firm said. "It's like this every year; you get used to it after  a while."</p>

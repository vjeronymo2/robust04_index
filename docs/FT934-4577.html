			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / World Trade News: US unlikely to oppose Chile's entry to Nafta THE US sees few, if any, obstacles to Chile's accession to Nafta or a bilateral free trade accord with Washington, Mr Curtis Kamman, the US ambassador in Santiago, said yesterday. Unlike most Latin American countries, which needed to liberalise their economies and lower tariffs, 'Chile has done all that. There's not much left for it to do,' he said. There were no specific environmental or labour issues blocking an agreement, he said. The US would, however, 'watch with interest' the passage of Chile's environmental protection bill and would hope to see swift implementation of its new regulatory framework. Further talks would be necessary in the area of intellectual property rights, where Chile had made some, though insufficient, progress. In particular, US pharmaceutical companies wanted greater protection for their patented products. The US was 'serious' about concluding new trade agreements 'in the near future'. However, 'we have not yet decided whether our preferred course is additional bilateral agreements with other countries or their accession to Nafta.' He rejected arguments that the US administration would tread carefully because of 'blood on the carpet' after the Nafta debate or because it now wished to concentrate on healthcare reform. The US was quite capable of pursuing parallel domestic and foreign policies, he said. Besides, President Clinton 'made clear during the Nafta debate that he wants to extend the agreement to other countries, with Chile mentioned as the first in line.' Canada's new Liberal government announced yesterday that it would enforce Nafta after obtaining improved rules on subsidies and dumping, Reuter reports from Ottawa.</p>

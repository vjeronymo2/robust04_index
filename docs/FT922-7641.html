			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Prado to lose masterpieces: A new collection arrives, and Guernica moves JUST as Madrid prepares to receive a fabulous artistic windfall, Spain's cultural bureaucracy is pillaging the long-established Prado museum of its 20th-century masterpieces. This weekend the first of 900 paintings owned by Baron Heinrich-Hans Thyssen-Bornemisza will be packed in Lugano, Switzerland, for eventual hanging in a lavishly overhauled 18th-century building across the street from the Prado. Next week the trustees of the Prado will be told the Culture Ministry has decided to remove Pablo Picasso's Guernica and put it in an arts centre called the Reina Sofia, to be inaugurated next month. 'It is as if the Louvre was ordered to hand over its antiquities to a new archaeological museum,' says Mr Alfredo Perez-Arminan, a former director general of Fine Arts - a section of the ministry - and a prominent member of the Friends of the Prado Association. Fuelling the controversy is the fact that Picasso, who was briefly the Prado's director, had specified that, once democracy was restored to Spain, Guernica should hang in the nation's premier museum. The searing canvas, which condemns the 1937 bombing of the Basque town of the same name during the Spanish Civil War, was painted in Paris and hung in New York until 1981. Under the Culture Ministry's plans the Prado will also lose to the Reina Sofia arts centre 63 preliminary sketches that Picasso made for Guernica, and the small but strong collection of Juan Gris and Joan Miro canvases donated to the museum by the cubist art historian Douglas Cooper and by Miro's widow. Mr Perez-Arminan points out that if the ministry rides roughshod over donations made to the Prado, the museum can hardly expect to receive any more. 'Why cannot the Prado be a proper home for Picasso, Miro, Gris and other masters of our century?' asks Mr Francisco Calvo Serraller, one of Spain's most influential art critics. Laments among Prado supporters do not end there. The Thyssen-Bornemisza collection, which will remain in Madrid initially for nine years, will make the city a magnet for art-lovers. But it effectively deprives the Prado of both funds and space for a long overdue enlargement. A total of Pta9bn (Pounds 49m) was set aside from the state budget to prepare the collection's new premises and to establish a fund that will provide Baron Heinrich-Hans with an annual Pta500m for the loan of his pictures. Restoration work on the new Thyssen-Bornemisza museum was completed last week and its roomy galleries will be opened in October. The magnificent building was originally intended to house the Prado's outstanding collection of Goyas and so allow the Prado space to exhibit masterpieces, among them a unique series of Tiepolos, stored deep in its vaults. The Culture Ministry says it has no money to offer the Prado alternative accommodation. It did not skimp, however, on the main beneficiary of the Prado's losses: Pta10bn has been spent to transform the Reina Sofia, a huge 200-year-old former hospital, into a modern art museum. So much was spent on rebuilding the Reina Sofia that little was left to augment a permanent collection that, save for legacies by Miro and Dali, is judged to be indifferent. The new centre's comparative poverty is the chief reason the Culture Ministry gives for its decision to poach from the Prado. Critics say it amounts to putting icing on a non-existent cake.</p>

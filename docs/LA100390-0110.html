			<p><P> October 3, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIELDER DOWN TO LAST SWINGS AT 50  </P> <P> Cecil Fielder remained stuck at 49 home runs, popping out twice and striking  out twice as the Detroit Tigers lost, 4-1, Tuesday night to the New York  Yankees.  </P> <P> Fielder, trying to become the 11th player to hit 50 homers, went hitless in  four at-bats for the second game in a row, striking out twice. He has gone 20  at-bats since his last homer.  </P> <P> Tiger Manager Sparky Anderson moved Fielder from his usual No. 3 spot in the  lineup to second, hoping to get him an extra at-bat, but it didn't help. He was  hitless in three tries against rookie Mark Leiter, against whom Fielder hit No.  47 on Sept. 16.  </P> <P> Anderson plans to bat Fielder leadoff in tonight's finale.  </P></p>

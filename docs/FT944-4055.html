			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Dominant Republicans cloud Clinton successes President Bill Clinton yesterday signed the implementing legislation of the Uruguay Round - completing the second of three foreign and trade policy successes which were supposed to end his year on a high note. However, the Republicans, still buoyant over their takeover of Congress, have been capturing the daily headlines with their proposals. The effect has been to marginalise Mr Clinton in both domestic and foreign policy arenas. A new poll attests to Republican successes. The survey found 41 per cent of voters approved of Mr Clinton's presidency, while 47 per cent disapproved. Two-thirds of Democratic voters wanted to see the president challenged in his re-election campaign. This was not how administration planners saw the end of 1994. Mr Clinton was to set a date for regional free trade at the Asia-Pacific economic summit, win approval for Gatt, and complete an historic summit of democratically elected Latin American leaders with a strategy for hemispheric free trade. But domestic concerns have overshadowed the events. At an emotional ceremony in the ornate hall of the Organisation of American States in Washington yesterday, Mr Clinton tried to address the anxious US middle class. 'It is true that one of the reasons for stagnant wages is intense competition in our markets. . . by people who work for wages our people can't live on,' he said. However, stability could not be restored without growing exports. 'We must go into the 21st century convinced that the only way to preserve the American dream is to be involved with the rest of the world.' The Gatt ceremony was not televised and few Americans will know it took place. Instead, they were hearing from Mr Newt Gingrich, the House speaker-in-waiting. On Wednesday he slashed funding for congressional caucuses - which brought charges of 'ethnic cleansing' from the black caucus. Yesterday he proposed eliminating federal funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which provides a counterbalance to the religious right and conservative talk show hosts who hold sway over the radio airwaves.</p>

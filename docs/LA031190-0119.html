			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> KADAFI DESIGNATED SUPREME LEADER OVER ALL LIBYA  </P> <P> The General People's Congress ended an eight-day meeting by elevating Moammar  Kadafi to the status of supreme leader, giving him wide-ranging authority to  overrule virtually any decision with which he disagrees.  </P> <P> The meeting, which ended Friday night, passed a law saying that Kadafi's role  in the 1969 revolution gives him a legitimacy from which all the country's  institutions derive their authority.  </P> <P> "So instructions issued by the leader of the great revolution, brother Col.  Moammar Kadafi, are binding, and it is a duty to carry them out," a declaration  of revolutionary legitimacy said.  </P> <P> Kadafi's new status is meant to clear up ambiguities over his role after he  repeatedly threatened to withdraw from the political arena, leaving the system  to run itself.  </P> <P> But political observers said it remains unclear exactly what powers Kadafi has  been imbued with.  </P> <P> The General People's Congress failed, however, to resolve an acrimonious  dispute between the executive branch and deputies over financing the welfare  state, with neither side the clear winner.  </P></p>

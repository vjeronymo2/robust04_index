			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Simon sells waste and water side to Thames SIMON Engineering has sold its water and waste treatment business to Thames Water, the privatised utility. Thames will pay Pounds 14.2m cash and assume Pounds 6m of debt. Mr Brian Kemp, chief executive of Simon, said the sale price was in line with expectations six months ago, when the group announced it would be withdrawing from most of its environmental businesses. Mr Kemp said he expected to be able to announce the sale of the environmental consultancy division consultancy within the next few weeks. Proceeds of the disposal announced yesterday will reduce gearing which stood at 50 per cent at the last half year. The sale ends a period during which Simon acquired the heady rating of an environmental stock but subsequently fell from grace as results failed to live up to expectations. From a high of over 400p in 1990, the shares fell to 70p late last year. They closed yesterday up 11p at 121p. The Simon businesses will further reduce Thames Water's dependence on income that is covered by the water regulators. 'It is a modest deal but it is an important element of our development programme,' said Mr David Luffrum, finance director at Thames. The business will be added to PWT, a water treatment design and contracting business bought in 1989. Together they will produce sales of about Pounds 300m. The Simon businesses made sales estimated in 1992 at Pounds 54m, and is expected to have shown a small operating loss. Profit before interest and tax in the previous year was Pounds 1.7m on sales of Pounds 66.5m. At end-1991, the businesses had net assets of Pounds 9.1m. Mr Mike Hoffman, chief executive of Thames, said the acquisition completed the plan 'for full capability in water engineering activities'.</p>

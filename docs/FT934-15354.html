			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / International Company News: Singapore Telecom valued at SDollars 30bn THE Singapore government has valued Singapore Telecommunications (ST) at a minimum of SDollars 30.5bn (USDollars 19.5bn), based on the price set for the first phase of the group's privatisation. Singapore is to sell between 1.1bn and 1.9bn shares, or between 7.2 and 12.5 per cent of the company, in three tranches. The basic price of SDollars 2 per share gives Singapore Telecommunications a prospective price/earnings ratio of 27. The ratio is higher than the market average of 23, but such a premium is in line with other successful telecommunications networks in Asia. 'It's priced quite aggressively, but it's a utility stock that's well managed and it's a play on the Singapore economy,' said Mr Manu Bhaskaran of Crosby Securities in Singapore. 'I think a lot of people will pile into it.' Earlier this year, analysts were placing a much more modest value on ST, but estimates have risen sharply in the last few weeks. A recent rise in the value of the Singapore dollar has been attributed partly to an inflow of funds for the purchase of ST shares. The three-tranche allocation system for ST shares reflects the government's plans to encourage Singaporean citizens to buy shares and maintain a personal stake in their economy. Two of the tranches are for Singaporeans only. Under Group A, the 1.75m Singaporeans contributing to the compulsory Central Provident Fund pension plan will be able to buy a maximum of 600 shares each, at a 5 per cent discount (a price of SDollars 1.90) and with the benefit of a special 40 for 100 shares 'loyalty' dividend paid in stock over six years. The government has set aside 350m shares for this group, but the figure could rise to 1.05bn shares in the unlikely event that everyone applies for the maximum allocation. Under Group B, 200m shares are set aside at a price of SDollars 2 each for Singaporeans only, including 40.7m shares reserved for ST employees. Each applicant can buy a maximum of 1,000 shares. Under Group C, both Singaporeans and foreigners may bid for the remaining 550m shares on offer, subject to a minimum bid price of SDollars 2. The number of shares could be lifted by 100m to a 650m ceiling if there is sufficient demand. Brokers expect the strike price, boosted by foreign investors keen to have a stake in what will be by far the largest company on the Stock Exchange of Singapore, to be above the SDollars 2 minimum. ST's flotation will increase the market's capitalisation by nearly a quarter. 'The competition is going to be for Tranche C. I expect the issue will be more than fully subscribed,' said one broker yesterday. Bids will be received from today until October 28, and the shares can begin trading from November 1 as soon as they are issued.</p>

			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / Europe in the firing line: Problems in the company's biggest market Employees at Digital's manufacturing facility in Galway, Ireland, used to receive free turkeys at Christmas. Today, the Ballybrit hardware plant is closed, the biggest victim of a continuing and seemingly inevitable retrenchment. In the 1970s and mid-1980s, Digital spread its manufacturing across Europe: minicomputers in Galway and Ayr, in Scotland, storage products and peripheral systems at Kaufbeuren in Germany, printers and terminals at Valbonne, France, semiconductors in South Queensferry, near Edinburgh, Scotland, and network systems at Clonmel in Ireland. Today, only Ayr and South Queensferry remain big manufacturing sites. The South Queensferry site, where Digital makes the Alpha microprocessor, said to be the world's fastest, is now manufacturing chips under contract to the US company Advanced Micro Devices. There are powerful suggestions that Digital is considering selling the plant to AMD. Mr Vincenzo Damiani, Digital's European president said this week, however, that it was unlikely the semi-conductor operations would be sold. Europe is nevertheless in the firing line. The total workforce is down to about 27,000 from 29,000 last year, and Mr Damiani confirms it is on course to fall to 23,000 by December. About 1,000 redundancies will fall on Digital's bloated direct salesforce. This total does not include extra job cuts which might be demanded following the latest analysis by Mr Robert Palmer, Digital chief executive, of the imbalance between the company's revenues and the size of its workforce. The 23,000 figure for Europe, however, was calculated by project teams commissioned by Mr Damiani, as soon as he took up his position at the beginning of the year. He said yesterday that the balance between performance and resources was monitored continuously: 'If revenue growth does not come, we will have to take action accordingly.' Europe, however, performed no better than the rest of the company last quarter and it is clear that the disappointing results were due to a large extent to poor management information. 'We were unable to ship enough workstations and network servers to satisfy demand,' said Mr Damiani. 'Our ability to forecast customer requirements accurately is not adequate. Our internal processes are not yet sufficiently customer-focused.' Having diagnosed the fault lines, it will take time, perhaps up to a year, to bring the monitoring systems up to scratch. It will be a nervous period for Mr Damiani and his team. Europe is Digital Equipment's single largest market, generating about half the faltering computer giant's annual sales. By comparison, the US accounts for less than 40 per cent of annual revenues. As a result, the company has been disproportionately hit as Europe's economies slid into recession over the past three years. The outlook in the UK is getting brighter, but France and Germany are still black spots. In Germany, Digital admitted recently that it had achieved little more than access to Kienzle's customers when it spent Pounds 122m for a controlling interest in Kienzle, a struggling computer company. Mr Damiani, who joined the company after 29 years with IBM, has put in place a strategy he calls 'Go to Market', based on a three-tier approach. Digital's 500 main European accounts will be managed directly by account executives. The small and medium-sized companies will be handled by a combination of the direct salesforce and other distributors. A new executive, Mr Barry Moloney, with extensive experience in the components and peripherals business, has been appointed to manage relationships with the large computer dealers and distributors. Substantial improvements will have to be made in the company's ability to meet its customers' needs by matching supply to demand. One senior Digital executive said: 'Our management processes have been focused internally, rather than on customer issues.' Overall, Digital employees in Europe speak of a sense of frustration with the system; a sense that a company with the technology, products and expertise that Digital undoubtedly possesses should have come to such a perilous pass.</p>

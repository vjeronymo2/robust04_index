			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / Guatemala 'political killings go on' POLITICAL killings are continuing in Guatemala despite the civilian government's pledge to end them, Amnesty International said yesterday, AP reports from London. Opponents of the government of President Jorge Serrano Elias also have been tortured and some simply 'disappear,' the London-based human rights group said in a report. 'The government may have changed, but the violations go on.' Mr Serrano, who pledged to protect human rights when he took office in January 1991, 'has singularly failed to do so,' it said. Amnesty has documented 'tens of thousands' of human rights violations in Guatemala during the past 20 years. It said the number of political killings by government forces has dropped - 'but we have yet to see whether this will be a lasting improvement. 'The odds are against it. Harassment, intimidation and death threats are on the increase, violators from the past are still walking free and the repressive structures are still in place.' A few human rights violators have been convicted, Amnesty said, and a presidential commission has been set up to co-ordinate human rights policy. Victims include street children, human rights workers, journalists, indigenous peasants, academics and trade unionists, Amnesty said. Some have been killed by members of the security forces in uniform, others were murdered by 'death squads' - military personnel in plain clothes so as to 'disguise their guilt'. Yet others have been killed by civil patrols - civilian groups said to be volunteers but under military control. Amnesty said the government has tried to cover its responsibility by claiming that victims were part of armed opposition groups. 'These allegations are often made, with little or no evidence, against whole communities of indigenous peasants, for example, or against human rights workers.'</p>

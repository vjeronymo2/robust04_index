			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Construction orders fall 10% TOTAL orders received by contractors for construction work fell 10 per cent in the final quarter of last year, compared with the same period in 1991, Department of the Environment figures show. Private commercial work, mostly offices and shops, and private housing were worst affected, with orders 28 per cent and 18 per cent lower respectively. A House-Builders Federation survey, however, has found a revival in sales this year with a sharp rise in the number of buyers visiting show homes. Three quarters of builders expect to build more homes this year. Alfred McAlpine fall, Page 27</p>

			<p><P> September 24, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MARKET BEAT: TWO CAUTIOUS WINNERS  </P> <P> Yes, many individual stocks are off 20% to 40% from their 1990 highs in this  bear market. The long-term investor in stock mutual funds, however, needs to  keep those figures in perspective: You didn't buy at the high, and if you've  been in the funds all year, you're probably not doing so badly -- though you  certainly ought to be prepared for a lot worse.  </P> <P> Let's say you bought into a typical stock fund in 1988. In 1989, the average  fund jumped 24%. So far this year, the average fund is down 10.3%. So you  haven't even given back the 1989 gain.  </P> <P> Those are averages, which means your funds might be doing a lot better or  worse. But the average 10.3% stock fund decline so far this year at least  provides a good reference point: You still have time to act, if you so choose.  </P> <P> For example, say you've stuck with your funds for many years, but now expect a  severe bear market -- one that might last another year or more. You might want  to sell a portion of your holdings to raise cash for investing opportunities  later.  </P> <P> There is no crime in taking some profits, especially for investors who have  enjoyed the full ride of the 1980s bull market. There are tax considerations,  of course, but they should be secondary to your investment outlook.  </P> <P> But what is the smart outlook now? Here are the views of two stock fund  managers, both of whom have managed to beat the market so far this year, even  though their views are almost at polar opposites. One or the other might echo  the concerns of the vast majority of investors today:  </P> <P> Ted Gemlich's IDS Stock fund, based in Minneapolis, is down just 4% for the  year. Gemlich has stuck with many of the big-name consumer growth stocks, such  as Pepsico, Philip Morris and Dayton Hudson. He also has kept a heavy weighting  in energy stocks, such as Halliburton and Mobil, and in health-care stocks.  </P> <P> If there's a lesson in Gemlich's strategy, it's that diversification across  industry groups pays off -- though admittedly, you have to pick the best  industry groups. Gemlich also has built a large cash cushion -- 20% of the  fund's $1.3 billion in assets -- as a prudent hedge against a falling market.  That cash cushion may grow a little more, but for the most part Gemlich plans  to stick with his 70-some stocks, even through a recession. Having already  pruned his holdings, he says, "I wouldn't sell a lot more."  </P> <P> At the same time, he says, he isn't rushing to buy stocks right now, even  though some values look compelling. "I don't see any hurry at this point," he  says. As the bear market progresses, he figures he'll be able to buy a lot of  stocks cheaper later on.  </P> <P> On the other side of the fence is Henry Van der Eb, who runs the $260-million  Mathers stock fund in Bannockburn, Ill. Van der Eb started raising cash in 1989  and has had about 85% of the portfolio in cash since the start of the year.  Thus, he's escaped the market's plunge, and his fund is up about 7% year to  date.  </P> <P> Van der Eb figures that the debt spiral of the 1980s will have to be unwound,  and he sees it as a tough experience for the economy. "This whole debt thing  has to slow down, and it's not going to slow down just over the next month but  over the next year or two," he says. "There's going to be a lot of pain."  </P> <P> Like Gemlich, Van der Eb is content to wait for much better buying  opportunities later. There are only a handful of stocks in his portfolio now,  one of which is Torrance-based International Technology. The company performs  such tasks as assessing and decontaminating hazardous waste sites. Though  earnings were erratic in the late 1980s, the company has been on a roll since  mid-1989. It earned 42 cents a share in the year ended March 31 on revenue of  $307 million. Van der Eb thinks 60 cents is likely this year, and 80 to 85  cents the year after. "It's one of the few companies that is relatively immune  to the economy," he says.  </P> <P> International Technology's stock has run up from $4.625 in 1989 to $9 now, and  it was as high as $12.125 in July. It's traded on the New York Stock Exchange.  </P> <P> Neither Gemlich nor Van der Eb can guarantee that they'll know exactly when  it's time to start buying again, of course. But their caution says a lot about  the mood of many big investors today: If you haven't taken at least some of  your long-term profits, you should. And with the economy sinking, now is not  the time to jump head first into stocks. As more big investors come over to  that point of view -- which seems inevitable -- the bear market will become a  self-fulfilling prophecy.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Briefly: Die-hard numbers junkies may notice that the average stock fund's  10.3% year-to-date decline is worse than the New York Stock Exchange composite  index's 9.8% loss. Both figures included reinvested dividends. If the average  portfolio manager has kept at least 10% of fund assets in cash this year, it  may appear to be a real indictment of fund talent that the typical fund is  under-performing an all-stock index. However, the funds' return is after  deducting management fees, which generally run about 1%. So you can figure that  the average fund's actual performance is closer to a 9.3% loss. Whether the  funds should be doing better than that, given their cash levels, is still open  for debate.  </P> <P> </P> <P> FUNDS SCORECARD  </P> <P> How various categories of stock and bond mutual funds fared in 1989 and so far  this year, versus the average NYSE stock:  </P> <TABLE CWL="3.32IN:1.89IN:2.55IN:3.32IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="4"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL SPN="2" CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Average total return  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Category  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1989  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Year to date*  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Fixed income  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> +9.4%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> +1.1%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Growth and income  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> +23.2%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> -9.0%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Growth stocks  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> +25.4%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> -10.1%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Intl. stocks  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> +22.3%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> -11.0%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Small-company stocks  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> +23.0%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> -13.5%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Gold-oriented  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> +22.5%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> -15.5%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> NYSE  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> composite index  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> +28.0%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> -9.8%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> General stock fund  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> +24.0%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> -10.3%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> * through last Thursday  </P> <P> Source: Lipper Analytical Services  </P></p>

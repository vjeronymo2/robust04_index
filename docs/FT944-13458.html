			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / International Company News: Record earnings at Ford Motor Ford Motor, the US's second biggest carmaker, reported record after-tax profits for the third quarter. It was lifted by strong demand for new vehicles in North America and a continuing recovery in its European operations. Mr David McCammon, treasurer, said Ford's sales and profits were likely to grow for some time to come. 'Unless interest rates go way up, this recovery will be sustained for three, four, five more years,' he said. There was no sign that the rise so far seen in US interest rates had stunted demand, he added. Ford's results echo record earnings reported by Chrysler two weeks ago, though General Motors, the biggest US car and truck maker, saw its recovery falter during the three months to September. Overall, Ford's after-tax profits jumped to Dollars 1.1bn, or 2 1/2 times their level of a year ago. The biggest factor behind the increase was a Dollars 245m improvement in profits from vehicle sales in North America, which reached Dollars 529m. A 17 per cent increase in vehicle sales and lower discounts offered to customers drove the improvement. The North American results also reflected lower purchasing costs and the fact that the company's advertising spending rose less rapidly than its sales. Leaving aside losses at Jaguar, Ford earned Dollars 25m in Europe - the first time time that it has not reported a third-quarter loss for five years. The summer period, with its model change-overs, is traditionally the weakest period of the year for carmakers. 'In Europe, sales are still 1.5m (vehicles) a year below what we consider to be normal - there's lots of improvement to come,' said Mr McCammon. The company's results were lifted by record earnings in its financial services business, which climbed 34 per cent, to Dollars 523m. This partly reflected higher leasing and other financing earnings linked to the sale of more vehicles. About 16 per cent of cars sold involved retail leases, while 37 per cent in all were financed by Ford's finance subsidiaries. The financing business added Dollars 290 of profit for each vehicle Ford sold in the US during the quarter, taking the total profit per vehicle to Dollars 865. Earnings of Dollars 1.04 a share, up from 40 cents a year ago, were recorded on sales of Dollars 30.6bn, up from Dollars 24.5bn. Lex, Page 20</p>

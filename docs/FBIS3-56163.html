This document was passed to Interfax by one of his nearest  associates, who witnessed the suicide of Georgia's first  president.    "I have used all legitimate and democratic ways of regaining  power. My people, who love me, did not do everything they could  to support me. I think my death will unite the people of  Georgia. Let it be a symbol of protest for all peoples aspiring  to freedom and independence," says Gamsakhurdia's testament.    "Russia, you, too, are to blame for my death. You will be  repaid a hundredfold for your unworthy deeds. You are as much  responsible for my death as my countrymen," says Gamsakhurdia's  testament.</p>

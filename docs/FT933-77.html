			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of Japanese Companies - Financial Review (3): Caution retards growth IN THE DIZZYING days of the late 1980s, Japanese brokers scrambled to hire employees and open new branches, believing that Tokyo stock prices were irrepressible and customers would be forming ever longer queues to buy the products on offer. Large brokers took space in departments stores and railway complexes, and the second-tier brokers developed first-tier ambitions, investing in unnecessarily sophisticated computer systems or, in the case of Sanyo Securities, building a Tokyo trading room the size of a large warehouse. From finding new ways to expand, Japan's brokers are now looking for creative ideas for cost cutting. For the 10 brokers in the second-tier, that may mean challenging old notions of job security by retiring middle-aged, middle managers instead of merely reducing the graduate intake. Banks are confronting a different bubble-era legacy, a rising pile of non-performing loans to property developers or to companies which used overpriced plots of land as collateral. Banks' core profitability has soared in the past year as interest rates have fallen, creating a favourable spread, but those gains have been lost to increased provisions for non-performing loans. The 11 leading commercial banks announced an average 70 per cent increase in loan loss reserves for the financial year ended in March, and wrote off a total of Y172.8bn, an increase of 478 per cent on a year earlier, but a only small portion of their combined non-performing loans of Y8,435bn. Bank of Japan officials are concerned that the bubble era has not only left scars on institutions' balance sheets, but made them overcautious in lending, possibly retarding economic growth. In its most recent quarterly outlook, the bank referred to this concern in its understated description of 'heightened risk aversion'. One difference between the banks and brokers is that the latter do not have the same portfolios of problem loans, while both are still struggling to cut costs in an environment made more competitive by financial deregulation. In July, the Industrial Bank of Japan, the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, and Norinchukin, the central agricultural bank, opened securities subsidiaries. The openings followed a decade of debate about reform, which was welcomed during the late 1980s, when there seemed to be profit enough to allow banks a limited role in the securities industry and to enable brokers to establish banking subsidiaries. But the stock market collapse, and the accompanying collapse in brokers' profits, changed the terms of debate and encouraged the finance ministry to impose tougher than predicted limits on banks' role in the securities industry. For example, it was initially proposed that banks house their new subsidiaries at head office, but by April, when the Financial System Reform Act became effective, the rules had changed. Banks were forced to put their new subsidiaries in a separate building. Staff at the securities operation had to wear a distinctive uniform, and they were not allowed to accompany the bank's employees on calls to clients. Apart from these restrictions, the banks were excluded from dealing in stocks, though they were able to underwrite convertible and warrant bonds. These limits have not been enough to save the more vulnerable second-tier brokers. Last month, Daiwa Bank was called on to rescue Cosmo Securities, which has reported extraordinary losses of Y68.9bn from tobashi, the shuffling of stocks around client accounts in the hope of not booking losses. Other second-tier houses are still in difficulty. Unlike the Big Four, Nomura Securities, Daiwa Securities, Nikko Securities and Yamaichi Securities, seven of the ten brokers have been unable to turn the market's rise over the past year into a profit. For the first half ending this month, Sanyo Securities is expecting a pre-tax loss of Y5.7bn, Kankaku Securities Y5.6bn, and Dai-Ichi Securities Y3.2bn. Mr David Threadgold, brokers' analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Research (Japan), said some of the second-tier brokers, in order to make profits, need a daily turnover value of almost Y600bn on the Tokyo exchange, about 30 per cent higher than the average so far this year.</p>

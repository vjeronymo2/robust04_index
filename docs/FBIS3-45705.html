			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Port Louis, 21 Jan (XINHUA) -- Qian Qichen, Chinese  vice premier and foreign minister, departed here for Paris early  this evening after successfully concluding a visit to six  African nations -- Ethiopia, Eritrea, Sudan, Kenya, Madagascar,  and Mauritius. On the eve of his departure from Port Louis,  Qian Qichan discussed the situation in Africa and China's  African policy in an interview with XINHUA reporters.    Qian Qichen said: During the current African tour, he has  been deeply impressed by the African people's new sense of  awakening sparked by drastic changes in the international  situation. Many African countries, while seeking economic  development, have focused their attention on safeguarding  national stability and at the same time, strengthened regional  cooperation. Noting the establishment of security mechanisms by  OAU and the breakthrough achieved in peace in South Africa, he  pointed out that the struggle against foreign intervention and  for national independence and sovereignty is making headway. In  short, Africa is facing challenges as well as historic  opportunities and is not without hopes, he added.    He said: Under the new situation brought about by the end of  the Cold War, regions are interrelated in their endeavor for  peace and various countries have become more and more  interdependent on each other in economy. World peace is  inseparable from Africa's stability; and an underdeveloped  African economy is not conducive to the global economic  prosperity. For this reason, the international community should  show concern for Africa, and the developed nations are  duty-bound to help the African countries. Africa needs  attention, not indifference; it needs help, not intervention.    Discussing China's African policy, Qian Qichen emphasized:  To strengthen unity and cooperation with the African and other  developing countries is the basis of China's foreign policy.  China shares much common ground with the African countries as  far as the international and regional situations are concerned.  China wholly respects the social system and development mode  chosen by the African countries in light of their national  conditions, and firmly supports the African countries' struggle  to safeguard national independence and sovereignty. We support  the African countries' efforts to ensure internal unity, to  develop economy, and to improve the people's livelihood; and we  also support the series of rational proposals by African  countries for reducing and exempting debts, protecting economic  interests, and strengthening South-South cooperation and  South-North dialogue.    On China's economic and trade relations with African, Qian  Qichen said: China's economic cooperation with the African  countries symbolizes the spirit of mutual benefit and assistance  and common development. He added that although China's  assistance to African countries is limited, it is sincere and  without any political strings attached.    He pointed out: Amidst constant changes in the international  and African scenes, the friendship between China and Africa has  withstood tests of history and become more solid. China will  never forget Africa's profound sentiments of friendship in times  of needs. He reiterated that regardless of changes in the  international and African situations, China will never alter its  principle of developing unity and cooperation with the African  countries. We deeply believe that our friendship with Africa  will definitely continue to grow and strengthen in the days and  years to come; and the lasting, stable, and mutually  beneficially friendship and cooperation between China and Africa  will further solidify and develop.</p>

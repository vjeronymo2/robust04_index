			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee prices 'could fall still further' THE COFFEE market, already close to 17-year lows, could fall still further before moving higher in a few months, according to the latest report from ED &amp; F. Man. Man believes there are three factors behind the recent fall, which has left prices similar to the early 1970s in nominal terms but 60 per cent lower if adjusted for inflation. First the bullish influence of the approach of International Coffee Organisation meetings is now almost non-existent; in fact ICO talks seem to have become a negative factor. Second, New York speculators have moved from holding long positions last September to short positions. Third, hard-pressed producers simply cannot afford to hold back sales, and roasters, particularly in the US, are more concerned about aggressive competition in the retail business. 'In all sectors the sentiment seems to be that while prices may recover during the course of the year, it is too dangerous to act now on the assumption that there will be no short-run downward moves in the price of coffee,' says Man.</p>

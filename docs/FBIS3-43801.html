			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The guest of Afrique Soir is Etienne Tshisekedi, the  Zairean opposition leader who is also the prime minister  appointed by the national conference. As you know, Marshal  Mobutu announced the dissolution of his own government, that of  Faustin Birindwa, and summoned the members of the former  National Assembly and of the High Council of the Republic on  Wednesday [19 January], so that they can elect a new prime  minister. The opposition has already announced that it regards  this decision as a coup. Tshisekedi broke his silence today.  He spoke to Monique Mas:    [Begin recording] [Tshisekedi] The real reason behind the  deadlock is that I was elected prime minister by the sovereign  National Conference, whereas Mr. Mobutu does not know [as heard]  this conference; he is going back to his own Constitution, and  this is dictatorship. This is why cohabitation is impossible,  because we do not have the same source of power. This is why  there were negotiations, so that we could define a common  framework of power. Cohabitation is necessary because the law  makes provisions for it. But since this law does not exist as  far as Mr. Mobutu is concerned, this is why we cannot cohabit.    [Mas] During this long-lasting crisis, don't you have the  feeling that the Zairean people may get tired of everyone,  including the opposition and yourself?    [Tshisekedi] Just the opposite. If you were here, you would  know that the people are more determined. It is [political]  circles -- certain political circles, especially those who  supported Mr. Mobutu's dictatorship not too long ago -- who are  saying such things, that people may get tired. People cannot  get tired in their struggle for liberation. People are dealing  with a dictator who enslaved them for years. They cannot get  tired of struggling to break free from slavery. We have not  chosen the [word indistinct] of arms, but we have chosen  nonviolence, and this is also the price that has to be paid.    [Mas] Very recently, the French Minister of Cooperation Mr.  Roussin was saying that a third way between you, Mr. Tshisekedi,  and the government of the parties close to the president, would  be a solution for Zaire. What do you think of that?    [Tshisekedi] Yes, but we have got used to the position of  the  French Government lately. So, we attribute to the French  Government putting pressure on the Togolese prime minister to  put him on the side of the dictator, because for them, they  think that when you have a dictator, you should be loyal to him  rather than put yourself on the side of the people. The Zairean  people, (?and) we who are following all this maneuvering by the  French Government, you can count on us: Mr. Roussin can speak,  he has the right to speak like anyone else, but in this country  we will ignore both Mr. Roussin and everything he says.    [Mas] How do you imagine the immediate future of Zaire? How  do you expect to act in the immediate future?    [Tshisekedi] Next Wednesday, 19 January, is the day Mr.  Mobutu intends to establish his new puppet government. We have  just called on all our people, both in Kinshasa and up country,  to hold a ghost town day that day, to show him our opposition  and our discontent, and we will also use a huge number of other  strategies -- mass demonstrations, civil disobedience, and so on  -- so that Mr. Mobutu will get involved, and we know that he  will do so.

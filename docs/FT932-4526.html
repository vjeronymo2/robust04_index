			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / Ten-hour blackout points up Indian power problem THE Indian government has ordered an inquiry into a power failure which has this week left Delhi and much of northern India without electricity for periods of up to 10 hours. The worst breakdown in seven years left householders sweltering in temperatures of 45 degrees Celsius bereft of light, air conditioning and sometimes water, because pump stations stopped working. Even the power supplies to districts inhabited by politicians and other preferential customers suffered prolonged cuts. More than 30 trains stopped in northern and eastern India; passengers were left stranded without light, cooling or water. Delhi's international airport was plunged into darkness for two hours. The failure raises questions about the Indian electricity network's capacity to supply the power the country needs for economic growth. Foreign and domestic companies have frequently cited electricity shortages as a crucial obstacle to investment. The Times of India, the leading English-language newspaper, said yesterday: 'The crisis is a measure of the long-standing maladministration and negligence of the country's power sector.' The cuts started on Sunday night after a transmission line in Uttar Pradesh state in northern India overheated. Power which should have been carried by this line surged into other lines causing further failures and breakdowns of power stations and transmission lines. At one point on Sunday night, the authorities were unable to supply electricity even to Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, an unprecedented failure given the attention lavished in India on VIPs. Many people left their homes to sleep on the street. Slum-dwellers, who are given to stealing electricity by suspending wires from overhead power lines and have become accustomed to the comforts of fans and coolers, if not of air-conditioners, are also affected. The government wants to increase generation capacity of the publicly-owned network in the five years 1992-97 by 30,500MW over the 69,000MW installed by March 1992. But in the past year, less than 1,000MW have come on stream. As the building of new stations has slowed so has the growth of electricity output, which rose by just 5 per cent in the year to March 1993, compared with an annual average of 9 per cent in the 1980s. The industry suffers from chronic losses because power is supplied at uneconomic rates to privileged groups such as farmers.</p>

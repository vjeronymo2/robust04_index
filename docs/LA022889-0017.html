			<p><P> February 28, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CABLE TV FIRM EXPECTS TO MISS DEADLINE  </P> <P> A United Cable Television official predicted Monday that his company would not  meet a deadline of midnight tonight for activating all of the long-awaited East  San Fernando Valley cable TV system.  </P> <P> "We're going to be very close," said United attorney Scott Adler. But he said  the company probably cannot meet the city-imposed deadline for the entire  870-mile system.  </P> <P> United, calling in crews from as far as Denver, has activated 99% of the  system, Adler said. Activation is adding power to cable so it is capable of  providing service to homes.  </P> <P> United won the franchise in 1983 on the promise that it would complete the  system by December, 1985. In June, the City Council granted the company an  unprecedented fourth extension until today to activate the system. United faces  $186,500 in fines if it fails to meet the deadline.  </P> <P> United -- already fined $271,000 in recent years for failing to meet city  deadlines -- contends that past delays have been beyond the company's control.  </P> <P> Susan Herman, general manager of the city Department of Telecommunications,  which regulates cable in the city, did not know the status of the East Valley  system on Monday but said she will send an inspector out Wednesday to see if  United has met the deadline.  </P> <P> Adler argued that the company is "substantially in compliance" with the  completion schedule.  </P> <P> Steve Schippers, United's director of operations, refused to speculate on how  soon service would be available to all residents. United has nearly 46,000  customers. Portions of Studio City, Toluca Lake and Universal City still lack  service.  </P> <P> United's franchise area takes in the Valley east of the San Diego Freeway and  north of Ventura Boulevard, except for portions of Sylmar, Sunland-Tujunga and  Sun Valley.  </P> <P> "We are as anxious to complete the system as residents are to get cable,"  Schippers said. "It only makes good business sense. We've made an enormous  investment in this cable system. We're not going to sit by and watch that  investment sit idle."  </P></p>

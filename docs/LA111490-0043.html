			<p><P> November 14, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOS ALAMITOS;  </P> <P> WRIGHT HOPES TO PULL OFF A FAST ONE  </P> <P> Ken Wright, a gynecologist from Fresno, hopes to go party-crashing Saturday  night at Los Alamitos with Jazzing Hi in the $125,000 Breeders Championship  Classic.  </P> <P> The Championship Classic, the highlight of eight stakes during Quarter Horse  Breeders Classic Championship Day, has been billed as a showdown between  champion females See Me Do It and Dash for Speed.  </P> <P> Wright, who owns the horse with breeder Wayne Charlton, went so far as to buy  an advertisement in recent Los Alamitos programs, proclaiming: "Jazzin Hi is  the fastest horse in the world. He will prove it in the Quarter Horse Breeders  Championship on Nov. 17 at Los Alamitos."  </P> <P> And he put his money where his mouth is, supplementing the 4-year-old son of  Merridoc for $12,000 in the 440-yard race.  </P> <P> "If he wins, it won't be an upset," Wright said. "He'll have dead aim on those  ladies.  </P> <P> "I know if they get too involved with each other, he's going to sneak by and  get it. If I'm within three-quarters of a length with 200 yards to go, I'll win  it.  </P> <P> "He's as raw-talented a horse as I've ever had," said Wright of the chestnut,  who has four firsts and four seconds in 10 starts. He won the Vessels Maturity  and finished second in the Los Alamitos Championship, a half-length behind Dash  for Speed, during the summer meet.  </P> <P> "He always has to come from behind," Wright said. "He was about two lengths  behind the mare in seventh with 80 yards to go in the Championship and made up  a length and a half. I watched the tape over and over again. I called (track  announcer) Ed Burgart and asked if he had ever seen a horse move that fast. He  said no.  </P> <P> "I guarantee people will see the fastest horse in the world. I guarantee at the  end he'll be catching the leaders."  </P> <P> Wright, a former partner of Dr. Edward Allred -- now president and CEO of Los  Alamitos -- in Long Beach, shifted his practice north 14 years ago.  </P> <P> "I bought my first quarter horse in 1974," Wright said. "I bought Triple a Deck  for $3,600 at the Pomona sale, he won his first race, and I was hooked."  </P> <P> Wright enjoyed greater success as the co-owner of Charger Bar, a world  champion, and The Black Alliance, a two-time divisional champion.  </P> <P> Jazzing Hi is out of Anna High, a stakes-winning half-sister to Charger Bar.  </P> <P> "This is the first male out of the Charger Bar line to do this well," Wright  said.  </P> <P> "I had good stock from the start and just thought I was going to ride it  forever," Wright said. "But I've been in kind of a drought the last six years.  Somebody closed the door.  </P> <P> "But now I've got Jazzing Hi and a nice 3-year-old half-brother to The Black  Alliance named One Kilo Whiskey. I'm back!"  </P> <P> As a final challenge, Wright has proposed a side bet with the owners of See Me  Do It and Dash for Speed.  </P> <P> "The winner keeps his (purse) money," he said. "The losers, if they finish  second or third, donate their winnings to charity."  </P> <P> Trainer Daryn Charlton, 27, has been preparing Jazzing Hi for the last three  weeks since the horse returned from Utah.  </P> <P> "If we can stay within a half-length 200 yards away, we could pull an upset,"  Charlton said. "The mares are the ones to beat, but there are four or five in  there who could win."  </P> <P> Expected to join the three in the Classic are Heisajoy, Tee Roy Reb and Wicked  Dash.  </P> <P> Los Alamitos Notes  </P> <P> The Dream Doctor might have earned a spot in the $25,000 Breeders Sophomore  Classic after scoring a two-length victory under Eddie Garcia Saturday in the  $55,729 California Sires Cup Derby in :19.69, only :16 off Dash for Speed's  track record for 400 yards. "I thought he ran a monster," said trainer H.J.  Visscher after the gelding's fifth victory in six starts.  </P> <P> "This is the first runner owned by Kathy and Don Clift of Orange," Visscher  said. "They claimed his dam, Proud Dream, and she broke down in that race, so  they bred her. He had some problems with sickness at 2, and I got him unraced  in January."  </P> <P> Fans who bet Grammas Noisy Jet to place in the first race Saturday were the  unluckiest of non-winners. Although she crossed the wire second, a head behind  Formalities, Grammas Noisy Jet and Azure Baby Bandit, who was unplaced, were  declared non-starters. Stewards flashed the inquiry sign immediately after the  race and discovered that Gates 1 and 2, from which the pair broke, opened an  instant late. Despite starting about a length behind, Grammas Noisy Jet, a 7-1  shot, almost hit the wire first after being sixth. All money bet on the two  horses was refunded.  </P> <P> Jockey Jim Lewis equaled a career-high four winners last Tuesday, scoring with  Flow Control, Our Buddy, Little Doc Mason and Twaynas Dash. "Twaynas Dash  qualified just so-so and ran a big race that night," said the 33-year-old Utah  native. "I was glad to win two for Wayne Thompson (Twaynas Dash and Flow  Control). He's my main stable."  </P> <P> Fans at Canterbury Downs in Shakopee, Minn., bet $24,591 Friday night as it  joined the Los Alamitos off-track network and will continue to do so each  Friday.  </P> <P> ESPN will tape the Breeders Championship Classics and televise them Nov. 25 as  part of the "America's Horse" show at 10 a.m., PST. In addition to the Grade I  Championship Classic, the lineup includes the Grade I $100,000 Juvenile, the  Grade I $35,000 Sprint, the Grade I $35,000 Distaff, the Grade II $25,000  Sophomore, the Grade III $25,000 Marathon, the Grade III $15,000 Freshman and  the $40,000 Pacific Derby.  </P> <P> One of the most interesting races will pit local star Baychaino against New  Mexico invader Ferrari in the Marathon at 870 yards. "Baychaino feels a lot  better after his last win than he did after finishing second at Pomona,"  trainer Charles Treece said. "He's a good 3-year-old hooking older horses. The  other horse (Ferrari) has never run on a five-eighths mile track, but they say  good horses run anywhere."  </P> <P> The Pacific Coast Select Breeding Stock Sale will be held in conjunction with  the Breeders Classics Sale Spectacular Sunday, beginning at 11 a.m., at  Barretts adjacent to Fairplex Park in Pomona. . . . Breeders Spring Classic  threat Chingaderos won the same race here in 1988.  </P> <P> Delinquent Account, runner-up in the $304,933 3-year-old Filly Pace in the  Breeders Crown at Pompano Beach, Fla., was bred by Pico Rivera restaurateur  Bill Smith. "I sold her for $35,000 at the Fasig-Tipton yearling sale in  Kentucky," Smith said of the daughter of On the Road Again-Aldente.  </P></p>

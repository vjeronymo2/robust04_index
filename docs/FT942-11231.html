			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Capitol raising Pounds 1.5m via 3m share placing Capitol Group, the specialist security company, has placed 3.2m shares at 125p through sponsors Granville Davies; dealings in its shares will commence on May 17. The company, capitalised at Pounds 11.5m, provides a range of security services, including fraud investigation, and port and ferry security. Capitol has raised Pounds 1.5m from the placing, which will be used to fund strategic acquisitions. In addition, Mr Ken Dulieu, the founder, will receive Pounds 2m of the proceeds, reducing his shareholding from 85 per cent to 59 per cent. The shares are being issued on an adjusted p/e ratio of 15.1, based on profits of Pounds 1m for the year to March 1994. Mr Dulieu said that the port and ferry business had been the main source of earnings growth in the past two years, but this was now being overtaken by the increase in fraud investigation work, particularly in the City.</p>

			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Dirty laundry looks to its past WHILE few may remember the drudgery of the traditional Monday wash, modern washing machines are arguably not as economical, effective or environmentally friendly as a washing board and a pair of hands. But now a French invention called the Wash'ball marketed by Welcom International promises a simple but ingenious solution. When a set of the 12 black shock-resistant balls are put in the washing machine along with the dirty laundry their mechanical action compliments the stirring and shaking movements of the machine to produce the effect of 'a good, old fashioned hand scrubbing'. Using the environmentally harmless 37mm diameter balls improves stain removal and cuts by half the amount of detergent needed, thus saving money, reducing waste and extending the life of washing machine parts like hoses and filters, according to the manufacturer.

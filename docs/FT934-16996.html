			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / Clinton and Major back Yeltsin: Clinton gives full support to Yeltsin PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday threw his weight behind Russian President Boris Yeltsin and blamed the 'significant violence' in Moscow on the forces of vice-president Alexander Rutskoi and parliamentary speaker Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov. Speaking on the White House lawn, Mr Clinton said Mr Yeltsin had 'bent over backwards to avoid the use of force.' 'We cannot afford to be in the position of wavering at this moment or backing off or giving any encouragement to people who want to derail the election process,' he said, adding that he did not expect President Yeltsin 'to be deposed' since the Russian people supported the president more than the parliament. The support was echoed, albeit more slowly, in the UK where prime minister John Major said that President Yeltsin had his 'sympathies and support in dealing with a difficult situation'. He said: 'Those who mounted today's ugly attacks in Moscow have no respect for civilised and democratic behaviour,' stressing that Mr Yeltsin had received a democratic mandate. Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, is expected to urge the other European allies to follow US support for Mr Yeltsin at the meeting of the EC foreign ministers in Luxembourg today. As concern mounted yesterday about the security implications of the unrest. Mr Manfred Worner, Nato secretary general, warned that the situation was 'extraordinarily serious' and said that if the army interfered in the conflict there could be civil war. Neighbouring Finland echoed the concern, noting that the crisis was 'very, very alarming'. Mr Klaus Kinkel, German foreign minister, yesterday said he supported Mr Yeltsin and condemned the use of violence. Hesitation in the European response appeared to reflect both unease about the prospect of bloodshed in Russia and concern in some diplomatic quarters that Mr Clinton's faith in Mr Yeltsin's ability to regain control could prove unfounded. Most diplomats were still deeply fearful about the implications were President Yeltsin to lose control, and insisted that Mr Yeltsin remained the best vehicle for economic reforms.</p>

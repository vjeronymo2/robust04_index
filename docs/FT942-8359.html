			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / International Company News: Hanson to step down as chief at Calpers Mr Dale Hanson, one of the leading figures in the movement to strengthen shareholder rights, is to step down as chief executive of the California Public Employees' Retirement System (Calpers), the largest public pension fund in the US. Under Mr Hanson, Calpers has become one of the most aggressive - and because of its size, influential - members of the shareholder rights movement, which seeks to make companies more accountable to investors by improving their corporate governance. Mr Hanson, 51, became chief executive of the California fund in 1987. He was expected to announce his plans at a press conference at Calpers' headquarters in Sacramento yesterday. Mr Hanson played an important role in encouraging the nascent shareholder rights movement to focus on companies' poor financial performance and agitate for change, rather than limiting its activism to issues such as anti-takeover poison pills. He pushed hard for executive pay to be more closely linked to financial results. A study by Wilshire Associates, the pension consulting firm, suggested his approach had produced positive results: the shares of companies targetted by Calpers between 1990 and 1992 had outperformed the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index of leading stocks. However, his forthright criticism of corporate under-performers made him unpopular with some pro-business Californian politicians, and he came under pressure from Calpers' board to cut back on high-profile corporate governance work in favour of more mundane fund administration. His departure leaves uncertainty over Calpers' corporate governance strategy. Mr DeWitt Bowman, Calpers chief investment officer, left the fund recently. He has been replaced by Ms Sheryl Pressler, a former McDonnell Douglas employee benefits fund manager.</p>

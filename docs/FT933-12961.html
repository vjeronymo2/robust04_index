			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading A QUIET morning proved to be the calm before the storm in stock index futures after gloomy signs for the US economy tested investors' nerves, Christine Buckley writes. Virtually ignoring the mid-morning UK money supply figures, dealers reacted actively to pessimistic remarks from the Federal Reserve on the US inflation rate and sold the FT-SE 100 September contract down. Fears were further fuelled by speculation over the possibility of an interest rate rise in the US. Such a violent reaction proved the poor underlying state of the futures market, according to one trader, who did not expect much promise to be seen before the August bank holiday. Some market watchers fear that the underlying support level of 2,780 for the September contract may soon make an appearance in trading. The contract greeted the day at 2,858 and enjoyed a brief spell at 2,863 before slipping back. The Fed's remarks pushed it to the day's low of 2,820 at about 3.30pm. A slight rally left it closing at 2,824 after 9,933 contracts traded. It trailed its fair value premium to cash by 1.9 points. Traded options had a lacklustre day with trade edging up only slightly to 20,879 lots from Monday's total. The FT-SE 100 option took the lion's share, at 8,493 contracts. Of stock options, only British Airways deals exceeded 1,000 lots, reaching 1,261.</p>

			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / EU ministers revive single currency hope The end of recession had revived the prospects of a European single currency by the end of the century, but only greater fiscal rigour would deliver the conditions for it, European Union finance ministers warned at the weekend. Meeting informally at Lindau in southern Germany, the ministers also signalled that political considerations could loosen the criteria which the Maastricht treaty sets for convergence towards economic and monetary union (Emu). It looks increasingly likely that the rules on deficit and debt levels will be applied flexibly to Ireland, whose government debt is well over the 60 per cent of gross domestic product recommended in the treaty. This could pave the way for the inclusion of other heavily indebted states such as Belgium. The weekend meeting prepared for the first use of 'excessive deficit' proceedings when finance ministers next meet in Brussels on September 19. Under this process, the European Commission will recommend budget deficit targets for 1995 and 1996 for the 10 states (all except Luxembourg and Ireland) which are above the budget-deficit target of 3 per cent of GDP set for Emu. Germany perceptibly softened its opposition to flexibility for Ireland. Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, underlined that Dublin was well within the deficit criteria and had made 'considerable progress' in cutting its debt ratio from 116 per cent to 90 per cent. Mr Waigel, in German press interviews on Saturday and in his press release for the meeting, had said that 'we did not write the debt quota (of 60 per cent) into the treaty as a joke' and that 'special treatment' would undermine public and market confidence in a single currency. Yet after the meeting, Mr Waigel sought to defuse the Irish issue, saying merely that 'we must make sure right from the beginning that the criteria are clear-cut'. Mr Hans Tietmeyer, Bundesbank president, said the 3 per cent deficit target 'is the upper limit; it should not be taken as a yardstick to aim at'. Only Mr Edmond Alphandery, the French minister, stood up for rigidity. He said: 'If you choose a loose interpretation then we have to explain very clearly why we are doing this.' The ministers agreed in principle to publish the Commission recommendations on excessive deficits after their meeting in Luxembourg on October 10. This could help clear the fog over Ireland, but could also risk market instability for countries such as Belgium and Italy.</p>

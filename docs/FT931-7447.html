			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Admiral advances to Pounds 3.99m Admiral, the Surrey-based computing services company, returned profits before tax of Pounds 3.99m for 1992, a 15 per cent increase on the previous Pounds 3.47m, despite intensifying competition and a commercial environment showing no signs of improvement. Turnover rose from Pounds 26.1m to Pounds 30.9m. Earnings per share were 24.2p (21.9p); a final dividend of 3.7p is recommended for a total of 5.4p. Mr Clay Brendish, chairman, said the company had performed well in all its business areas, although the emphasis had changed markedly. Financial services constituted the company's largest market, accounting for 34 per cent of turnover, but the proportion of business coming from the commercial and industrial sectors doubled to 22 per cent.</p>

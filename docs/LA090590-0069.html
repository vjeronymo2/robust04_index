			<p><P> September 5, 1990, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> LAWYER FIRES BACK IN FRYMAN CANYON SUIT  </P> <P> An attorney for the proposed developer of Fryman Canyon said Tuesday that a  lawsuit filed by the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy is a bid to depress the  value of his client's 63-acre property in the hills above Studio City.  </P> <P> Attorney Ben Reznik said the long-expected lawsuit is "part of a pattern of  attempts to drive down the price of Mr. (Fred) Sahadi's property."  </P> <P> For several months, the conservancy has been negotiating to buy the entire  Fryman Canyon site, a steeply sloped area covered with oak and walnut trees and  intersected by a stream. The talks have often been tumultuous, and the two  parties have sharply disagreed over price. The state agency says the canyon is  worth $8.7 million, while Sahadi has had it appraised at $13.7 million.  </P> <P> Conservancy Executive Director Joe Edmiston denied Reznik's charges, saying the  agency's lawsuit and its negotiations to buy Fryman Canyon are "separate  questions."  </P> <P> The lawsuit names the City of Los Angeles and Sahadi as defendants. It seeks to  require Sahadi to dedicate 32 acres of the canyon to the conservancy  immediately, which would prohibit Sahadi from building a temporary road across  that land. The temporary road would provide construction access to 31 other  acres of the site, on which Sahadi wants to build 26 luxury houses.  </P> <P> Dedication of the 32 acres to the conservancy was one of the primary  requirements during the city's review of Sahadi's project, the conservancy's  lawsuit claims.  </P> <P> Reznik said the conservancy had misread the city's tract map conditions. He  said the city did not require Sahadi to deed the 32 acres to the conservancy  until after he had finished his project, which allows the use of the 32-acre  site for the road.  </P> <P> According to the suit, Sahadi offered the 32 acres to the conservancy in 1986  to satisfy one of the conditions imposed in 1982 as a prerequisite to obtaining  a major development permit, known as a final tract map. On Nov. 3, 1986, the  conservancy board accepted the offer. On March 5, 1987, a city official agreed  that Sahadi had lived up to the condition.  </P> <P> In October, 1988, the city granted Sahadi a final tract map.  </P> <P> The lawsuit claims that the city Planning Department mistakenly agreed that  Sahadi had met the open-space condition although it had "no evidence" that the  land had been transferred to the conservancy.  </P> <P> The suit was filed Friday, only days after Sahadi began minor construction work  on the site and posted no-trespassing signs to shut down the Betty B. Dearing  Trail, a hiking path that cuts across the property and that the suit said was  supposed to be dedicated for public use.  </P> <P> Recalling that the trail was first opened to the public in 1985, Edmiston told  reporters Tuesday at a news conference overlooking the canyon that "it's a sad  day when we have to file a lawsuit to regain that trail."  </P> <P> Saving the canyon from development has become a cause celebre of a band of  environmentalists and several lawmakers, including state Sen. Herschel  Rosenthal (D-Los Angeles), who attended the news conference.  </P> <P> The city is also accused of failing to notify the conservancy in 1986 that it  was considering Sahadi's request to build a temporary road across the land that  was to be dedicated to the conservancy. The road was needed for hauling 388,000  cubic yards of dirt across the canyon.  </P> <P> Construction of the road would "permanently destroy the open space," Edmiston  said.  </P> <P> The alternative to building a road on the site would be to have the trucks haul  the dirt through the winding city streets, Reznik said.  </P> <P> The conservancy's lawsuit was supported Tuesday by the filing of a second  lawsuit by two environmental groups, Urban Wilderness Coalition and Mulholland  Tomorrow. That lawsuit parallels the conservancy's charges, and disputes the  legitimacy of a city grading permit issued to Sahadi.  </P></p>

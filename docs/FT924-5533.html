			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / Arts: Huddersfield looks to Europe - Andrew Clements finds the potentially most fascinating pieces to be thoroughly dispensable festival chic Britain's leading new-music festival, its only annual new-music festival, has a lively, cosmopolitan look for 1992. In previous years the Huddersfield Festival of Contemporary Music has alighted upon a small group of composers to be surveyed and explored, with other unrelated events clustered around the thematic centres. This time the net appears to have been cast wider: the celebrations are less intensive but there are more of them, mixing the familiar mainstream with the less well known - a visit from Berio to conduct his own music, tributes to Xenakis at 70 and to the late John Cage, alongside introductions to the music of the Italian Franco Donatoni, the Swiss Klaus Huber and the French Gerard Grisey, and updates on the progress of David Bedford and Mark-Anthony Turnage. There genuinely is something for everyone during the 11 packed days, and the happy mix of audiences - London new-music groupies with students from the newly chartered Huddersfield University as well as local concert-goers - testifies to its broad appeal. This year too the festival has a glossier, more costly look, for fortified by funds from the European Arts Festival, the director Richard Steinitz has been able to import three ambitious evenings straight from the Continental festival circuit that would normally lie well outside his orbit. Next weekend will bring the British premiere of Georges Aperghis' music-theatre extravaganza H, while the festival has already experienced Grisey's Le Noir et l'etoile and the Xenakis-inspired Tale of a Faust. Both events, in prospect the most fascinating items in the Huddersfield schedule, proved substantial disappointments. Grisey is an interesting figure whose music remains relatively unexplored here; Xenakis's potential as a dramatic composer has never seemed fulfilled. But it would be hard to decide which of the shows to which their names were attached here was the more flimsy and shallow; both were expensive festival chic of a thoroughly dispensable kind. Grisey's piece at least had the merits of consistency and purpose. Performed by Les Percussions de Strasbourg before a capacity audience in the Huddersfield Sports Centre, Le Noir et l'etoile uses the sounds of two deep space pulsars as detected and transformed by radio telescopes as the numinous basis for a hour-long discourse. One of these stellar sounds arrived by high-definition BT cable direct from Jodrell Bank, the other, a Southern Hemisphere source, had been preserved on tape. The percussionists used headphones, presumably to align themselves with these heavenly clicktracks and from time to time 'windows' opened in the textures, allowing the listeners a sample of this arcane source. Yet the musical function of these pulses, other than as evocative sound objects, was never made clear and the pseudo-theatrical trappings - artily positioned canvas drapes, light show, smoke machines - added little to what was a routine display of Strasbourg virtuosity, with calls and responses across the arena, complex rhythmic assemblages and massive explosions. Grisey is a better, more thoughtful composer than he allows himself to be in this work. In Tale of a Faust, Xenakis's direct involvement was hard to establish. He certainly supplied the music, recycled from a clutch of existing pieces including the choral Nuits and Serment, the percussion Rebonds, and the baritone and percussion Kassandra. But other hands (Didier Betourne and Zoe Fachan) appear to have fashioned them, piecemeal, into this specious scenario which portrays Faust as a solo percussionist, Mephistopholes as baritone and Marguerite as a trapeze artist. The chorus wanders around looking by turns mildly interested and thoroughly bored. It is a totally pretentious and musically cosmetic piece of opportunism, relying on spectacular coups, especially some heart-stopping trapeze work from Veronique Betourne, and torrential percussion playing (from Roland Auzet) to make its effect. The relationship between Xenakis's music and what unfolded on the stage of Huddersfield Town Hall seemed pretty tenuous; it was not one of the festival's more successful forays into the dimly defined world of contemporary music theatre.</p>

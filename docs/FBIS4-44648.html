			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Jacopo Giliberto: "The Lower House Says Yes to </F> the Environmental Agency"]    [Excerpts] Rome -- Environmental policy will have an  "operational branch," a single body dealing with ecological  monitoring, technical standards, data collection, and the  promotion of research into pollution. It is the National  Environmental Agency (ANPA), the establishment of which the  lower house approved yesterday morning with 284 votes in favor,  24 against, and 11 abstentions just before the motion of  confidence in the government. ANPA will perform controls in  companies and in all environmentally hazardous situations and  will also submit proposals and advice to central and local  government concerning the accepted levels for pollutants,  standards for the quality of the air and water, and waste  treatment.    The document approved by the lower house is identical to  that  approved by the senate last December and transforms a previous  -- but very different -- government decree into law. Its  creation was "long-winded and difficult" commented the former  Green and later PSI [Italian Socialist Party] representative  Rosa Filippini, who was also one of the most fervid supporters  of the new organism. But the crucial moment for its creation  was the 18 April referendum that removed the responsibility for  health controls from the local health units. The first decree  is dated 1 August and gives the go-ahead on the bureaucratic  procedure during which the document was reviewed three times and  underwent considerable modifications.    From the structural point of view, the initial proposals --  based on overseas experience -- provided for a "light" central  organism (no more than 200-300 employees) with a widespread  presence at local level or vice versa a "heavy" central  structure with a barely noticeable local structure. A  compromise was decided upon: Provincial and regional authorities  will be required to establish their own territorial facilities  to work side by side with a large-scale national agency. The  "heart" will be ENEA's [National Agency for New Technologies,  Energy, and the Environment] DISP (with a staff of about 300),  which represents the former and now under utilized nuclear  program control body; an additional 150 people from other ENEA  departments; staff from other organisms such as the Higher  Institute of Health; ISPESL (Safety in the Workplace); the CNR  [National Research Council], and from some ministries (primarily  the environment ministry). The ANPA management will be composed  of three directors appointed by the environment minister (with a  three-year term in office) who will nominate the president. The  director general will be appointed by the prime minister, but on  the basis of proposals made by the environment minister.  [passage omitted]    In particular, the recently-approved law creates new  controls  that will supplement existing ones (which the law did not  abrogate). Here are some examples. ANPA will have jurisdiction  over regulations concerning industrial waste, as will the CNR  and the Higher Institute of Health; work safety, together with  the labor ministry; polluting emissions, which also remain the  jurisdiction of the Higher Institute of Health; the issuance of  the "green" European label (Ecolabel) and ecoauditing, for which  there are no specific organisms. It does not amend the  jurisdiction set for the CNR, the national department of  technical services (which falls under the prime minister), and  ENEA (which comes under the industry ministry).

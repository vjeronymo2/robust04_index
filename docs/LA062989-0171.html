			<p><P> June 29, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FINANCIAL MARKETS;  </P> <P> STOCK PRICES FALL SHARPLY; DOW OFF 21.63;  </P> <P> BOND MARKET RALLY FIZZLES AS TRADERS SELL TO TAKE PROFITS  </P> <P> The stock market, wavering through an up-and-down week, fell sharply Wednesday  after a surprisingly large decline in May leading economic indicators raised  fears that a sharp slowdown in the economy could lead to lower corporate  profits.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials, which had been down 20.49 on Monday and  up 14.99 on Tuesday, dropped 21.63 to 2,504.74.  </P> <P> Declining issues outnumbered advances by more than 2 to 1 in nationwide trading  of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 485 up, 997 down and 488  unchanged.  </P> <P> Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 158.47 million shares, down from  171.09 million in the previous session.  </P> <P> "Investors may have become somewhat concerned that the U.S. economy has slowed  too much, which may hurt corporate earnings," said Charles Jensen, market  analyst for MKI Securities.  </P> <P> The Commerce Department reported that the index of leading economic indicators  fell 1.2% in May, for a drop that exceeded most advance estimates on Wall  Street.  </P> <P> That provided new evidence that the pace of the economy was slowing  significantly, fulfilling a goal of the Federal Reserve.  </P> <P> But the response to the news in the credit markets was unenthusiastic. Rates on  government securities actually rose as traders cashed in some of the recent  gains in bond prices.  </P> <P> In addition, brokers said, the leading indicators were not warmly welcomed by  traders who have been worrying that a slowing economy might be setting the  stage for a recession and a slump in corporate profits.  </P> <P> Talk has also increased lately that earnings at many multinational companies  are likely to suffer before long as a higher dollar cuts into the income they  realize in foreign markets.  </P> <P> Losers among the blue chips included USX, down 1 at 35 1/2; American Telephone  &amp; Telegraph, down 1/4 at 36 1/8; Eastman Kodak, down 1/8 at 49;  International Business Machines, down 1/2 at 113 7/8, and General Electric,  down 3/8 at 53 3/8.  </P> <P> Oil service stocks extended their recent gains on hopes for a revival of  exploration and production demand. Halliburton rose 1 5/8 to 34, Schlumberger  was up 1 to 40 7/8 and Baker Hughes gained 1 to 20.  </P> <P> Technology issues were broadly lower, by contrast, in the over-the-counter  market. MCI Communications lost 1 1/2 to 37 1/2; Apple Computer slipped 7/8 to  41 3/4; Intel dropped 1 1/8 to 30 1/2, and Micron Technology fell 1 3/8 to 20.  </P> <P> Large blocks of 10,000 or more shares traded on the NYSE totaled 3,582,  compared to Tuesday's 3,722.  </P> <P> Credit  </P> <P> The credit market's powerful rally ran out of energy as traders sold to collect  profits.  </P> <P> Much of the selling involved long-term government securities, which pushed the  yield on the market's bellwether 30-year Treasury bond up to 8.13% from 8.07%  late Tuesday.  </P> <P> The price of the key bond, which moves in the opposite direction to yield,  tumbled 5/8 point, or $6.25 for every $1,000 in face value. The drop erased  more than half of Tuesday's gain.  </P> <P> Mitchell Held, an economist with Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co., pinned  the selloff on desires to cash in some winnings after the market's strong  performance lately.  </P> <P> The end of the second quarter on Friday provides an added incentive to take  profits because money managers typically adjust holdings prior to preparing  quarterly reports for clients.  </P> <P> Carl Steen, a market analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., said there was no  fundamental economic reason for the retreat. The Commerce Department's report  on the index of leading economic indicators predictably provided evidence of  slower growth.  </P> <P> Bond traders have been bidding up prices on rising optimism that weak business  activity would induce the Federal Reserve Board to pursue a more generous  credit policy and drive down interest rates.  </P> <P> Held of Smith Barney believes that the Fed might loosen its credit grip soon,  leading to a decline in interest rates.  </P> <P> Some analysts, however, doubt that the central bank is apt to relax its stance  significantly because economic growth has maintained sufficient momentum to  keep inflation rolling along at an unacceptably fast pace.  </P> <P> "The market has been thinking the Fed will ease rates to stimulate the economy  but we don't think the economy is as weak as all that," Steen said. "We think  there's still strength out there."  </P> <P> The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was  quoted late in the day at 9.563%, up from 9.438% late Tuesday.  </P> <P> Currency  </P> <P> The dollar ended higher against key foreign currencies in thin, lifeless  trading despite reports of central bank intervention.  </P> <P> Gold prices fell. Republic National Bank of New York quoted an ounce of gold at  $374.40 as of 4 p.m. EDT, down 85 cents from Tuesday's late bid.  </P> <P> Currency dealers said the dollar got a lift mainly at the expense of the  Japanese yen, following increased speculation that Prime Minister Sousuke Uno  of Japan might be forced to resign because of a sex scandal.  </P> <P> Uno's predecessor, Noboru Takeshita, announced his resignation just two months  ago in the wake of a financial scandal involving Cabinet ministers, officials  and businessmen.  </P> <P> Dealers said reports of dollar selling by the Bank of Japan and the Federal  Reserve kept the currency in a fairly narrow trading range.  </P> <P> Trading was described as very quiet prior to the Independence Day holiday; many  dealers were also apparently reluctant to do much buying or selling at the end  of the quarter.  </P> <P> London financial markets also were quiet because of a one-day rail and subway  strike that kept some dealers and investors away from their offices.  </P> <P> One British pound cost $1.5613 in London late Wednesday, cheaper for buyers  than late Tuesday's $1.5640. Sterling fetched $1.5580 later in New York, down  from $1.5660 on Tuesday.  </P> <P> In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins, the dollar  closed at 143.55 Japanese yen, up from 141.23 yen. It traded lower in London at  142.65 yen, and at 143.25 yen in New York, up from 141.75 yen late Tuesday.  </P> <P> Gold fell in London to $375.25 an ounce from $376.75 late Tuesday. The late  Zurich, Switzerland, price was $373.75, down from $375.75.  </P> <P> Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold closed at $373.55, down from $373.85.  </P> <P> Silver prices declined. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current  delivery settled at $5.282 an ounce, down from $5.306. Silver closed in London  at $5.30, down from $5.33.  </P> <P> Tables begin on Page 6  </P></p>

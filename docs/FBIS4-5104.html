			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special article" contributed by ROK Foreign Minister Han </F> Sung-chu, entitled "How Should We View the North Korean Nuclear  Issue?" --date not given]    [Text] The burden in the hearts of people hoping for a  satisfactory solution to the North Korean nuclear issue, has  grown with each passing day. At the same time, the people are  irate over the recent reckless remarks and acts of the North  Korean delegation.    The people's view of the nuclear issue is motivated by their  ardent patriotic sentiment. How then, has this situation  developed? How can we break through this situation?    The world's nations are making efforts to join a new  post-Cold War global order comprised of liberal democracy and  the market economy. However, a mere handful of nations are  spurning this trend. Unfortunately, and to our dismay, North  Korea is one such nation, and may in fact be a most extreme case.    What kind of choice did Pyongyang, isolated from the  international order, have? While the norm would be to pursue  the citizens' welfare and peace, Pyongyang chose the opposite  road. In other words, it invoked the nuclear problem. Will  Pyongyang's rash gamble be successful? North Korea's adherance  to nuclear development will ultimately lead to Pyongyang's  defeat. The North Korean economy will sour even more and North  Korea will become a helpless international orphan.    Pyongyang alone denounced the statement of the UN Security  Council President that the world supported.    What is our strategy in dealing with North Korea? When the  North Korean nuclear problem was raised, there were some who  called for procuring nuclear arms. However, we know that this  road leads to mutual destruction. The road to coexistence is to  remove the suspicion of North Korean nuclear development. Our  choice is to persuade North Korea to realize a solution to its  nuclear problem and to join an international flow which is  healthy to itself.    Only this strategy will not sabotage the peace and security  of the Korean peninsula in the course of pursuing a resolution  of the North Korean nuclear issue. This strategy will improve  North-South relations and lay a foundation for national  reunification.    In view of this strategy, our immediate goals toward the  North Korean nuclear issue become clear. First, we should  prevent North Korea from further extraction of nuclear  materials. Second, we should make efforts to place nuclear  materials already produced in North Korea under the control of  the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]. Third, we should  attempt to make North Korean nuclear facilities peaceful and  safe like our energy facilities.    During the past year, these strategies and goals of ours  were  supported by the consensus of the people. I must frankly admit,  however, that recently, public agreement on the method for  achieving such aims has not been clear. The people's consensus  on the solution method is more important now, with the North  Korean nuclear problem pending at the UN Security Council, than  ever before.    The approach we pursued during the past year for a solution  to the North Korean nuclear issue, was to first resolve the  problem through joint efforts by the North and the South, and to  rely on international strength secondly, only when our efforts  proved futile. Incentive and pressure (more commonly referred  to as carrots and sticks) were the means used to resolve the  nuclear problem. Up to the present, dialogue has been the  preferred channel for solving the problem because, at the least,  we would gain time for us to prepare the sticks. Now that the  North Korean nuclear issue has been referred to the UN Security  Council, a change began to take place in the of dialogue and  sticks, and the importance of sticks is growing.    This means that the international aspect in resolving this  issue is becoming more important. The role of the ROK and of  allies including the United States and Japan was particularly  important in the course of dialogue. However, the Chinese role  is now growing and the attitude of Russia and nonaligned  countries in the UN Security Council is also becoming important.    The number of nations looking to play a part in the  nuclear issue, not to mention the nations directly concerned, is  increasing. This means that we cannot effectively solve the  nuclear problem by merely taking North-South relations into  account. We must now be prepared for such changes in the  situation.    The most important factor in our attitude for preparations  is  precise awareness of the essence of the problem. In other  words, while keeping our strategy and goals firm, our methods  and means should neither adhere to a single-track nor be  hardline.    With the referral of the North Korean nuclear issue to the  UN  Security Council, and the apparent need for a long-range  solution, we must discriminate between the essential and the  marginal, and the more important from the less important. We  should keep a long-term perspective on the situation, rather  than going from elation to sorrow from one moment to the next  over temporary developments in the situation. We should remain  patient in applying means and methods and display wisdom in  consolidating our internal unity.    While it is true that those who harbor deep feelings and  concerns for a satisfactory solution to the North Korean nuclear  problem are more likely to harbor brighter and more ardent  expectations toward this, it is not reasonable to expect an  immediate solution. In particular, we may be inclined to view  North-South relations, which remains at its starting point, as  being in a state of competition and confrontation. However,  this viewpoint is not helpful for a solution to the nuclear  problem. Moreover, if our feelings and self-esteem are affected  by North Korea's attempts to regard a symbolic, worthless  victory in confrontation with us as a great victory, we may  easily be dragged into its psychological game, and the situation  will become more complicated.    We are indeed in a difficult situation. However, we should  recall our strategy and goals and consolidate them. It is also  important for us to wait for the right opportunity by assuming  flexible attitudes, means, and methods. This will only be  possible when we balance principles and means, have a broad view  on international affairs, and a long-term view on developments  in the situation. We should cherish, above all, a sense of  self-confidence and faith that time is on our side.</p>

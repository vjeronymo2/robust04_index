			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Chapter 2 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> RECOMMENDATIONS <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> When the Prospective Payment Assessment Commission (ProPAC) was created by the Congress in 1983, its primary responsibility was to examine issues related to the Medicare prospective payment system (PPS) and make recommendations for updating and improving it. The Congress gradually has expanded ProPAC's mandate to include payment policies for all facility services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries. Accordingly, the Commission has conducted analyses of Medicare payments for skilled nursing facility (SNF), home health agency, and endstage renal disease (ESRD) dialysis facility services. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, at the request of the Congress, the Commission has examined the adequacy of Medicaid hospital payment rates and the use of Medicare payment methods for other payers. It has also analyzed issues related to the design and implementation of a global budgeting system to restrain health care spending. ProPAC continues to devote substantial effort, however, to updating and improving payment for hospitals under PPS and for those hospitals and distinct-part units excluded from PPS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although this report is submitted to the Congress, the Secretary of Health and Human Services is required to consider ProPAC's recommendations and respond to them in the annual notice of PPS rulemaking published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The Commission is always pleased to work with the Secretary to provide additional analysis and information on its recommendations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ProPAC's recommendations reflect the collective judgment of the 17 Commissioners. By the nature of their subject, some recommendations are reviewed each year, such as the annual update factors. Others address new issues or modify previous recommendations. All incorporate recent research findings. For fiscal year 1995, the Commission's recommendations address broader issues related to Medicare and health care reform, in addition to the recommendations that relate more specifically to Medicare facility payments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Recommendations for Fiscal Year 1995 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission's recommendations center on three areas of concern: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Medicare and health care reform,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Payment updates, and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Other payment policies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ProPAC's recommendations are intended to improve the equity and effectiveness of Medicare's payments for health care services. In this report, the Commission has considered certain aspects of health care reform that may affect the Medicare program. The recommendations that address payment updates reflect the Commission's view on aggregate spending levels. Finally, other recommendations concern the distribution of Medicare payments or the equity of Medicare's payment formulas. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Medicare and Health Care Reform <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The health care industry is facing major challenges this year as legislators and policy makers struggle to control health expenditures and expand coverage to people without insurance. Several legislative proposals have been introduced to reform the health care system. Some of these focus on incremental changes that would affect the financing and delivery of health care. Others call for fundamental restructuring of the existing systems. Most include provisions affecting the Medicare program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Health Security Act introduced by the President would fundamentally change the financing and delivery of health care. Under this proposal, most people under 65 would obtain health insurance coverage through regional or corporate alliances. These alliances would negotiate with health plans to provide medical services. The health plans would compete for patients on the basis of quality and costs. This managed competition among plans is expected to control the growth in health expenditures. As a contingency, however, premium rate increases would be limited if expenditure growth were not contained. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicare would be retained as a separate program under the President's proposal, although it would be subject to a number of cost-saving measures. Reductions in hospital payment updates are proposed. The disproportionate share (DSH) adjustment would be substantially reduced; however, universal coverage may ameliorate many of the problems this adjustment is intended to address. Medicare's indirect medical education (IME) adjustment would be replaced by an Academic Health Center Account to which Medicare and the alliances would contribute. Medicare's direct medical education payments for the cost of training medical residents would also be replaced by a special account funded by all payers. Although the Act incorporates mechanisms to ensure the quality of health care provided to those enrolled through the alliances, the oversight provided by Medicare's Peer Review Organizations (PROs) would be discontinued. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission believes health care reform would have a major impact on both providers and beneficiaries. The first eight recommendations for fiscal year 1995 reflect the Commission's concerns regarding the effect of health care reform on the Medicare program, providers, and beneficiaries. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Recommendation 1: Medicare, Medicaid, and Private Payer Payment and Coverage of the Uninsured <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Health care reform will have a major effect on the Medicare and Medicaid programs and the care beneficiaries receive. The Commission believes substantial changes in program policies should be considered only with a health care reform plan that covers the uninsured and pays comparable rates for similar services. As Medicare and Medicaid have constrained payments, providers have obtained additional revenue from private payers rather than by reducing their costs. This increasing reliance on cost shifting concerns ProPAC because it is likely to have a negative effect on access to care for beneficiaries of government programs. Further, possible adverse effects on beneficiaries of slower growth in payments for hospital and other currently covered services must be carefully balanced against desirable effects of increased Medicare spending for new benefits proposed in the Health Security Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Health Security Act proposed by the President contains a number of complex features that interact and could have a major effect on the services Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries receive. The Act would slow the growth in Medicare and Medicaid spending for currently covered services, create a new prescription drug benefit, and add coverage for long-term care services for the disabled. It would also use premium limits to curb the rise in private payer spending and extend coverage to the uninsured. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicare and, more recently, Medicaid have been important sources of additional revenues for hospitals that treat a disproportionate share of the poor. Substantial reductions in payment levels, such as those proposed in the Health Security Act, could adversely affect access to care for beneficiaries in both programs. Such reductions should be considered only insofar as health reform provides coverage for the uninsured. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicare and Medicaid beneficiary access to quality care also depends on whether providers receive appropriate payments from both government programs and private payers. Proposals that would further restrain spending by public payers but that fail to narrow the gap in payment to cost ratios between public and private payers or to provide coverage for the uninsured could make it more difficult for the beneficiaries of public programs and the uninsured to obtain access to necessary care. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As both Medicare and Medicaid have constrained payments in recent years, hospitals have turned to private payers for additional revenue to offset losses, rather than reducing the increase in their expenses. Cost shifting has allowed the Medicare program to curb spending, while permitting beneficiaries to receive services at costs that exceeded payments. It has also enabled many hospitals to maintain their financial position. The ability of hospitals to cost shift, however, has reduced their financial incentive to control expenses and increased the costs for subscribers of private insurance plans. The reliance on cost shifting as a revenue source has also disadvantaged hospitals that provide services to a large share of Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries and charity care patients.Further, cost shifting has disadvantaged hospitals where private payers successfully control hospital revenues. Consequently, hospital financial condition and the availability of services increasingly are determined by payer mix rather than by efficiency. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A health care reform plan like the Health Security Act, which would constrain the growth in private payer as well as government spending, could also affect the care received by Medicare beneficiaries. Since hospitals would not be able to obtain additional revenue from private payers, they would have to limit expenses to a level consistent with revenues. The slower rise in payments for current Medicare services, however, would be accompanied by increased spending for a new prescription drug benefit and coverage of certain long-term care services. As the reform debate continues, balancing the effects of a slowdown in spending for hospital and other covered services with an increase in expenditures for new benefits is necessary to avoid untoward effects on Medicare beneficiaries. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

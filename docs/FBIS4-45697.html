			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article from Brussels EUROPE: "EU: Strong </F> Support for Technologies Which Transform Solar Energy Directly  Into Electricity at Conference"]    [Text] Amsterdam, 14 Apr 94 (AGENCE EUROPE) - The 12  European Photovoltaic Solar Energy (PV) Conference, in Amsterdam  this week under the auspices of the European Commission and  which ends on Friday, enabled some 1,200 scientists, engineers,  industrialists and politicians from some sixty countries from  throughout the world to examine how one could maximise the  methods for directly transforming solar energy into electricity.  At the centre of the debate lay the research and development  into more effective, less vulnerable and especially less  expensive photovoltaic cells. Around 600 projects of concrete  application of solar energy were presented in Amsterdam; the  European Commission presented, notably, the efforts it had made  in the field through the THERMIE programme (and THERMIE II has  just been proposed by the Commission, see yesterday's EUROPE,  p.8). The European Commission will continue to support the  development of renewable energies, said the Commission's  representatives in Amsterdam: in the 4th Research  Framework-Programme (1995-98) over Ecu 1 billion is provided for  research, development and demonstration programmes into  non-nuclear energy, of which 60% into renewable energy  sources.  Hendrik Tent of the Commission's DG XII, said that a large part  of these funds would be used for developing photovoltaic solar  energy. Wolfgang Palz (DG [Directorate General] XII), moreover,  announced that the European Commission intended to present a new  programme soon entitled "Power for the World", whose aim will  mainly be to support the implementation of photovoltaic solar  energy projects in countries of the Third World. In this  context, the Conference criticized the loan policy of  multilateral financing organizations towards Third World  countries for relying too heavily on the extension of large  conventional energy production and grid connections, without  taking account of ecological difficulties, the enormous cost of  infrastructures, etc. in these countries. Funds would be better  used for energy generated decentrally and distributed  independently: photovoltaic solar energy is considered to be a  more suitable solution, most agreed. "The efforts of the  European Union and its Member States are not enough", said the  president of the European Association for Solar Energy  (EUROSOLAR), Herman Scheer, deploring the fact that nuclear  energy still occupied a privileged place compared to alternative  energies where Community funding was concerned. The current  President of the Environmental Council of the European Union,  Greek Minister Elisabeth Papazoi deplored the fact that solar  energy was encouraged so little: "Everyone knows the answer, but  no one wants to give it. Everyone wants solar energy, but only a  few are engaged. Most agree that renewable energy deserves more  money, but funding is insignificant". The Netherlands' Economic  Minister, Dr. J.E. Andriessen, stressed the great ecological  advantage of renewable energy in which production is not  accompanied by carbon dioxide emissions or other polluting  gasses. If converting solar energy into electricity is still too  expensive to be applied on a wide scale, it should, after the  year 2010, be the most widespread form of renewable energy in  the world, said Mr. Andriessen. The Netherlands currently  produces 1,000 kilowatts in photovoltaic solar energy; in 2010,  it ought to produce 250 megawatts, he estimated. On the fringe  of the Conference, the Becquerel Award was attributed to the  American scientist Morton B. Price for his work and in  particular for the invention of the first cell with a 10%  yield  in 1954 and the Bell solar battery. EUROPE recalls that the  Becquerel Award has been awarded by the Commission since 1989 to  a person having contributed in an extraordinary way to  developing photovoltaic solar energy.</p>

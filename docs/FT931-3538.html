			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Upbeat forecast for Scots economy THE Scottish economy is forecast by Mackay Consultants, a firm of economic consultants, to resume growing in 1993 after declining in 1992. Mackay believes Scotland will benefit from the devaluation of the pound because its industries are more oriented towards exporting than the UK average. Mackay predicts that the Scottish economy will grow by 1.4 per cent in 1993. This compares with the Treasury's forecast in the 1992 Autumn Statement for the whole UK economy of 1 per cent, although the average for the UK made by independent commentators is now 1.4 per cent. Although the government's estimate for Scotland's gross domestic product only goes up to 1991, when it showed a 0.2 per cent decline, Mackay concludes that in 1992 Scottish GDP fell by 1.3 per cent, slightly worse than the UK economy as a whole which fell by 1.0 per cent, according to the Treasury. Unemployment in Scotland went below that of the UK as a whole in February 1992 for the first time in living memory. In January 1992 it was 9.9 per cent on a seasonally adjusted basis compared with the UK figure of 10.6 per cent, giving Scotland a lower unemployment rate than all regions of the UK except for the east Midlands and East Anglia. Mackay expects the large Scottish electronics industry to be one of the strongest manufacturing sectors in 1993. Prospects for the Scottish Economy in 1993.

			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Hilclare cash call as deficit is trimmed Hilclare, the USM-traded manufacturer of lighting and security products, yesterday called for Pounds 315,000 net via a rights issue and also reported reduced losses for the half year to end-September. The cash call is through the issue of up to 1.07m new shares on a 2-for-7 basis at 36p apiece. The existing shares closed 5p lower at 43p. The issue is underwritten by Wise Speke. Proceeds will be used to provide working capital and to reduce debt. The deficit for the opening half was cut from Pounds 70,000 to Pounds 45,000 pre-tax. Turnover totalled Pounds 1.18m (Pounds 1.31m). Losses per share emerged at 0.9p (1.7p). Directors said the loss reflected 'normal seasonal' influences in the core lighting business and continuing difficult trading conditions. However, the company was now benefiting from the 'seasonal upturn' in demand for lighting products which was expected to continue through the winter months. Directors expected a 'satisfactory' full year performance and said they intended to declare a dividend of not less than 0.5p (same) on the enlarged capital.</p>

The council is established to, among other things, assist the Secretary of Education in carrying out responsibilities under the Indian Education Act of 1988 (Part C, Title V, Pub. L. 100&hyph;297) and to advise Congress and the Secretary of Education with regard to federal education programs in which Indian children or adults participate or from which they can benefit and submit a list on nominees for the position of Director, Office of Indian Education. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Chairman of the National Advisory Council on Indian Education has called for a meeting of the full Council from September 20&hyph;23, 1994. On Tuesday, September 20, and Wednesday, September 21, the agenda consists of an orientation session for newly appointed members that will include: ethics training; swearing-in ceremony; discussion of current Indian education issues; and meeting with officials from the Department of Education and with representatives of Indian organizations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The closed portion of the meeting will be held on Wednesday, September 21, from 1:00 P.M. to 5:00 P.M. and will be devoted to interviewing candidates for the position of Director, Office of Indian Education. Subsequently, the Council will submit recommendations to the Secretary of Education for filling such vacancy. Interviews with the candidates and discussions held in conjunction with the selection process will involve matters which relate solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of the Council and are likely to disclose information of a personal nature where disclosure would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy if conducted in open session. Such matters are protected by exemptions (2) and (6) of section 552b(c) of the Government in the Sunshine Act (Pub. L. 94&hyph;409; 5 U.S.C. 552b(c)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The remainder of the meeting schedule on Thursday, September 22, and Friday, September 23, is open and will be a continuation of orientation activities.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Israeli human rights organization, Betzelem, has  sharply criticized the lethal gunfire used by the army to quell  Palestinian riots. At a news conference in Jerusalem today,  Betzelem said soldiers killed 21 Palestinian since the Hebron  massacre.    In response, the government said soldiers were under orders  to be restrained but found themselves in life-threatening  situations. Steve Linde reports:    [Begin recording] [Linde] Betzelem says after the mosque  massacre the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] (?streamed) large  numbers of troops into heavily populated Palestinian areas and  permitted them to use live fire against Palestinian  demonstrators. Betzelem research director Yuwal Ginbar:    [Ginbar] It was found that during less than a week 21  Palestinians and one Israeli were shot to death by Israeli  security forces. This is an extremely large number. This stems  from the fact that, right after the massacre, the army--instead  of being moderate, instead of being tolerant, instead of letting  the population express its anger and grief--went in with force  to all the population centers, used heavily live ammunition in  order to disperse crowds. And the result was the deaths, so  many deaths.    [Linde] In response, the government says soldiers opened  fire  only when their lives were threatened. Government Press Office  Director Uri Dromi:    [Dromi] Those soldiers were under danger for their life, and  they had to open fire in order to rescue themselves from the  situation. Needless to say, there were orders given to the  soldiers in the beginning to try and restrain themselves--use  the minimum fire possible--because we were all aware of the  anger and the pain and the agony of the people. But,  unfortunately, in this kind of loaded situation and strained  environment, law and order must be maintained, and it is the  duty of the army to do so.    [Linde] Betzelem called on the authorities to refrain from  augmenting forces in Palestinian population centers and  introducing troops not trained in riot control, and it urged the  government to immediately halt all forms of collective  punishment, such as curfews and closures.

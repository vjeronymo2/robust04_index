			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / International Company News: Rhone-Poulenc applies for Renault stake Rhone-Poulenc, the French pharmaceuticals and chemicals group, yesterday said it had applied to become one of a group of stable shareholders in Renault, the vehicles group which is being partially privatised. According to Rhone-Poulenc, which was sold off last year, its decision to seek an investment in Renault reflects an agreement to develop new engine emission technologies with the motor group. Under the terms of the agreement, the two companies will work on ways to reduce emissions from diesel engines. The aim is to equip vehicles with new emission systems by 2000. As part of Renault's partial privatisation, which will see the state's shareholding reduced to just over 50 per cent from 80 per cent, the government is seeking to form a group of long-term stable shareholders which will hold about 5 per cent of Renault's shares between them. In addition to Rhone-Poulenc, potential candidates include Elf-Aquitaine, the oil group; Axa, the insurance company; Lagardere group, the communications and defence company; and Banque Nationale de Paris. The decision on the composition of the shareholding group will be taken by the economy ministry in consultation with the privatisation commission, an independent body which advises the government on privatisation issues. Those companies selected as so-called 'partner shareholders' will buy their shares through a private placement and will be required to hold their shares for a specified period of time, expected to be about 18 months. The formation of a group of stable shareholders is a common element of French privatisations and flotations involving public-sector companies. It has resulted in a series of cross-shareholdings between some of France's largest industrial groups. Elf Aquitaine and Banque Nationale de Paris, for example, took stakes in each other at the time of their privatisations. 'It is a way of guaranteeing some stability in the shareholding structure following the reduced participation of the state,' said one industry observer in Paris. 'There is sometimes an industrial logic to the investment, but it is often a case of mutual support between French business groups.'</p>

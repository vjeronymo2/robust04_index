			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / Survey of Mexico (13): Trade balance still largely unchanged  -North American Free Trade Agreement Nearly a year after the North American Free Trade Agreement first came into effect, there is no giant sucking sound of jobs and factories moving from the US to Mexico. Overall, trade flows between US and Mexico have increased substantially, but not to any one country's benefit; the two way balance of trade has remained largely unchanged. Nor has integration of North America's economies moved as fast as many once predicted. Regulations governing trade and investment between Mexico and the US have, if anything, become more complex since the treaty came into effect. US companies have complained this year about new Mexican Customs requirements, delays and red-tape at the border, plus stricter enforcement of sanitary and labeling standards. At the same time, though Nafta was intended to reduce uncertainty about Mexico's political and economic future by indefinitely committing it to pro-market economic policies, foreign investors remain nervous about the country's economic and political prospects. Partly as a result of the peasant rebellion in Chiapas over the New Year, and the March assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio, the then-leading presidential candidate, Mexico's interest rates in real terms have risen since the treaty came into effect and the stockmarket has fallen, in dollar terms. Heralded by some of its supporters as a mechanism that would transform Mexico's economy, and attacked by critics in the US as an agreement that would destroy US jobs, Nafta has so far had a modest economic impact. While growth of two-way trade and investment has accelerated, and the US and Canada moved to support Mexico's currency after Mr Colosio's assassination, the treaty has played a much smaller part in shaping economic and political events on both sides of the border this year, than, for example, the rise in US interest rates. 'Trade agreements do not turn trade relationships upside down,' says Mr Jeffrey Schott, a fellow at the Institute for International Economics in Washington, DC. 'There are a lot of people whose analysis of the treaty was 'out of the ball park,' on both the positive and negative side.' While Nafta's supporters and opponents accept that Nafta has not yet lived up to some of the wilder expectations held for it, they argue that eight months is too short a time to judge its overall impact. The strongest effects - in terms of higher economic growth for Mexico, or arguably loss of US jobs - will, it is contended, be felt over the long-term as the bulk of tariff and non-tariff barriers between the two countries, and with Canada, are removed. In Mexico, the government has downplayed Nafta throughout most of the year, wary perhaps that the agreement had been given too much attention in previous years, and partly on the defensive after Zapatista rebels in Chiapas attacked it as a 'death sentence' for the country's Indian population. Indeed, the view - never very widely held - that the treaty would rapidly usher in a period of stability and prosperity has been dropped. 'It was always a dubious notion that Nafta would make Mexico's political institutions more solid and the country more stable,' said one leading ruling party figure earlier this year earlier. 'It merely establishes what are the boundaries of feasible economic policies.' Asked to point to benefits of Nafta this year, officials and many businessmen believe that the agreement has reduced the economic impact of the political shocks this year. They reckon Nafta gave investors confidence that economic policy will remain unchanged, irrespective of political developments. Mr Ernesto Zedillo, the president-elect, and the two main opposition candidates in the August election, all broadly supported the accord. 'None of the political events this year have changed the fundamentals for us,' says Urlich Sander, head of corporate communication at Vitro, one of Mexico's largest industrial companies. 'We are still on the border of the largest market in the world, and because of Nafta we are still having to prepare ourselves for full competition.' Such an argument appears partly supported by economic figures. Despite the political uncertainty, direct investment into Mexico has increased rapidly this year. Mexico's non-oil exports to the US have grown by over 20 per cent. While Nafta contributed to such flows, most economists caution that it was of an influence than the raw figures indicate. Trade and investment between Mexico and the US was growing rapidly before Nafta was in place, reflecting a long-term trend towards economic integration, independent of the agreement. With Mexico's economy sluggish, and the US's expanding strongly, Mexico's exports would have grown strongly even without an accord. In some cases, Nafta may have made trade more difficult. Many companies based in Mexico and the US have found it difficult to work what out - if any  -benefits they are due under the agreement, and how to comply with new complex regional content rules set out by the treaty. Mexico's decision to enforce trade regulations such as Spanish-language labelling and sanitary standards more tightly has led to delays at the US-Mexico border, and complaints from exporters and importers. Just as the business climate has been slow to change, critics contend that there has been no noticeable improvement in Mexico's enforcement of labour and environmental laws since Nafta came into effect. Indeed, Mr Jose Antonio Ortega, head of Radian Corporation, a large environmental consulting firm in Mexico City, says enforcement has relaxed this year, as the Mexican government no longer has had to worry about US public opinion. The three secretariats set up under Nafta to enforce the trade, labour and environment agreements are still not fully operational, with some key positions to be filled. So far, US labour unions have filed two complaints alleging that Mexico is not enforcing labour laws, but as was clear when the side agreements were made public, the process of reviewing these complaints has been long-winded and none, up to now, have been successful.</p>

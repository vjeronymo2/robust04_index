			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: Reports by </F> Diplomatic Correspondents Igor Porshnev, Vitaly Trubetskoy and  others]    [Text] Russia has joined preparations for the political  part of the Naples summit which will involve eight countries,  Interfax was told Tuesday by Deputy Russian Foreign Minister,  Sergey Lavrov, who recently returned from Rome where he took  part in the meeting of deputy foreign ministers.    He said that the political part of the summit will involve  eight countries. As to the economic part of the summit,  countries will act according to the formula "seven plus one".    Obviously, the G-7 will consider behind closed doors the  macro-economic situation in the world, for example, the currency  and financial relations.    At the meeting in line with the formula "seven plus one" the  delegates will consider the pace of cooperation in support of  the Russian reforms, he said. "We need concrete deeds and  further shifts to materialize the understandings which were  reached in the past years. I do not think we need more aid  packages or graphic figures. Now it is a matter of the quality  of cooperation, or what could be described as  non-discrimination, open markets, the lifting of artificial  obstacles on the road of Russia goods, services and capital."    Lavrov believes that one should not change the official name  for the Group of Seven. The economic part is the basis for the  group's activities. The "political eight" is a reality and the  term used during the preparations for the summit, as well as  during the correspondence between Russian President Yeltsin and  Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev with their counterparts,  he said.    The deputy foreign minister is confident that joining the  G-7  in political terms would enhance Russia's ability to exert  influence on world political processes. "Russia influences world  politics regardless of its membership in one organization or  another," Lavrov said.    He referred to the foreign ministers' conference on Bosnia  held in Geneva recently as an example. "This kind of  qualitatively new partnership, when the leading powers work out  a common attitude and seek to pursue it through different  organizations -- the U.N., the CSCE, and the like -- reflects  our influence as well as our and our partners' readiness to take  each other's interests into account and act jointly. This is  the essence of what we call the political G-8 and multilateral  strategic partnership."    "Considering the fast development of events on the world  scene, it's hard to say what will be the essence of political  statement to be issued by the summit in Naples on behalf of its  chairman, the Italian Prime Minister," said Interfax's  interviewee. "But the general topics are already evident -- the  situation in Bosnia, conflicts in Central America and in Africa,  the nuclear problem on the Korean Peninsula, human rights...,"  he said.    "Russia maintains a full-scale political dialogue, turning  or  already turned into partnership, with each of the G-7  countries," Lavrov pointed out. "Such relations have their own  specificities, of course, but this does not prevent us from  finding common approaches to international problems. There are  no fundamental differences or substantial disparities in the  approaches to international affairs -- to, say,  non-proliferation problems, peace-keeping, the efforts to  strengthen and raise the effectiveness of the U.N., regional  conflicts and crises," he said.</p>

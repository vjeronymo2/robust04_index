			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: WEST HOLLYWOOD;  </P> <P> APARTMENT OWNER FINED  </P> <P> The owner of an apartment building in West Hollywood was fined $2,350 this week  for a misdemeanor violation of the city's rent-control ordinance.  </P> <P> Aroon Buranaskorn, owner of an apartment building at 938 N. Spaulding Ave.,  entered a no-contest plea in Beverly Hills Municipal Court to one count of  violating a section of the law prohibiting landlords from soliciting  application fees from prospective tenants, a court official said.  </P> <P> The case stemmed from an October, 1989, incident in which a manager at the  apartment accepted a $2,000 "finder's fee" from the prospective tenant,  according to Richard Dorsey Muller, West Hollywood director of rent  stabilization.  </P> <P> Muller said Buranaskorn was charged with two counts of the violation after it  was disclosed that the apartment manager was acting on Buranaskorn's  instruction. The second count was dropped by Municipal Court Judge Judith O.  Stein.  </P></p>

			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Telegraph shows 9% advance to Pounds 44.3m  -Advertising income up but circulation revenue improved to 46% of total THE TELEGRAPH newspaper group, which floated last July, yesterday announced record pre-tax profits of Pounds 44.3m for 1992, an increase of 9 per cent despite the impact of the continuing recession on newspaper advertising revenues. Mr Conrad Black, chairman of the Telegraph, which publishes both the Daily Telegraph and the Sunday Telegraph, admitted that the company had been apprehensive about 1992 because the recession showed so few signs of improvement. However, group turnover rose by 8.3 per cent to Pounds 237.2m and operating profit increased by 14.7 per cent to Pounds 37.5m. The proposed final dividend is 6.5p, higher than indicated at flotation, and makes a total of 11p for the year, a 22 per cent increase. This excludes the special dividend of 10p paid before the company came to market. Earnings per share have dropped by 6.3 per cent to 23.8p because of a doubling of tax charges mainly because tax losses flowing from restructuring charges have been used up. Costs were contained during the year and advertising revenue rose by 4 per cent, but the percentage of revenue from circulation rose to 46 per cent of the total compared with 33 per cent in 1989. There was also Pounds 5.9m income from associated companies, 90 per cent of it from a 15 per cent stake in the John Fairfax group in Australia. 'Our policy has been fairly aggressive on price increases,' Mr Joe Cooke, Telegraph managing director, said yesterday. The money is then invested in promotion to try to improve the proportion of 15 to 34 year olds reading the paper. A weekly 20-page Business News section will appear for the first time this Saturday. The new sector is designed to strengthen the Saturday paper and try to lure away some Sunday Times advertising. The Telegraph will call an extraordinary meeting towards the end of next month to vote on the plan to buy a stake in Southam, the Canadian newspaper group. Hollinger, which owns 68 per cent of the Telegraph, has bought 22.6 per cent of Southam and proposes to sell half to the Telegraph. The Audit Committee of the Telegraph, which includes directors such as Lord Hartwell, Lord Swaythling and Lord Rawlinson, will decide whether to recommend the purchase to the board. COMMENT The Telegraph's performance is a real achievement in the depths of a recession, although papers such as the Daily Telegraph do engender considerable loyalty. If there is an significant upturn, particularly in classified advertising, a high proportion of the revenue will flow to the bottom line, helped by the tight cost controls. Pre-tax profits could be as high as Pounds 52m to Pounds 54m this year, giving earnings of about 27p for an unchallenging p/e of 13. Further ahead, the Southam deal, followed perhaps by US acquisitions, offer the prospect of enhanced growth.</p>

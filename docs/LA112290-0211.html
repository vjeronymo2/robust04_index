			<p><P> November 22, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA;  </P> <P> NIGHTCLUB PARKING RULES TOUGHENED  </P> <P> Despite strong opposition from Councilman John Acosta, the City Council this  week approved a new set of parking regulations for lodges, cabarets, bars and  nightclubs in the city.  </P> <P> The ordinance, which was tabled numerous times during the summer and fall, is  part of a package of stricter residential and commercial parking requirements  recently approved by the council.  </P> <P> The council's action changes parking requirements to one space for every 28  feet of public assembly area.  </P> <P> The old rules required dance halls and lodges to provide one space for every  150 square feet of floor area. Nightclubs, cabarets and bars were required to  have one space for each 35 square feet of dining or drinking area plus  additional parking spaces for each seat inside the facility, said Larry  Yenglin, associate planner.  </P> <P> "The new standards simplify everything and bring all the businesses under the  same regulations," Yenglin said.  </P> <P> Acosta, who was on the losing end of a 5-2 vote, said he opposed the new  regulations because he felt they unfairly target Mr. J's, a restaurant at 2101  E. Edinger Ave. that has been cited by the city for operating illegally as a  nightclub.  </P> <P> Although the ordinance is meant to affect only incoming businesses, Mr. J's  falls under the new rules because it is not in compliance with current city  code, city officials said. It is the only existing business affected by the new  parking standards.  </P> <P> Acosta accused city staff of a "backdoor move" meant to make that specific  property available for an auto lot.  </P> <P> City Manager David N. Ream said the city is not currently looking into that  possibility.  </P> <P> But Mayor Daniel H. Young said if an auto lot were eventually proposed for the  site, he would support the idea. "Living in that area, I'd say it's a natural,"  Young said. GREG HERNANDEZ  </P></p>

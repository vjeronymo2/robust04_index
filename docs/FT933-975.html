			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Arts: Stuff and nonsense - Malcolm Rutherford has an uncomfortable time at the theatre WATCHING a play which one dislikes intensely, while others around are manifestly enjoying it, leads to a sense of humility. This has happened twice in the last two days, so since no theatre critic can wish to deter people from going to the theatre, I shall stick mainly to description rather than comment. The two plays are wildly different. One is The Life of Stuff by Simon Donald at the Donmar Warehouse. The other is Marvin's Room by Scott McPherson which has moved to the Comedy Theatre after a successful showing at the Hampstead. Stuff takes its origins from the big bang theory of the universe. There was 'loads and loads of stuff floating about,' explains one of the characters towards the end. 'I think it was hydrogen.' Much of seems to have landed anarchically somewhere around Glasgow. The play is clearly intended as a cry of pain and possibly protest, though of the four letter word kind that one had thought had gone out in the theatre after the deposition of Margaret Thatcher as prime minister. Here is a drugs culture dominated by a local mafia. Or at least I think there is: nothing in Stuff is overt. A relatively small crime - setting fire to a van in order to claim the insurance money - turns into a larger one when it emerges that there was a body inside. It looks like murder. Meanwhile all sorts of other criminal activities have been going on. Someone has had his toes chopped off: they are presented as cocktail sausages and consumed with apparent satisfaction. There is a persistent mimicing of an affluent society. One man spends his time trying to get into a dinner jacket, but has problems with the tie. No-one else can fix it either, though someone observes that it is a mark of civilisation for a man to be allowed to touch another around the neck without intent to harm. The tie remains untied. Offstage there is said to be a Volvo with a sawn-off shotgun under the front seat, also a Mercedes. There is an endless supply of drugs and drink. Frank Sinatra is repeatedly on the record player, especially 'The Wee Small Hours of the Morning'. The economic framework is not explained; nor is the social background. Presumably deliberately, characterisation and motivation are obscure. At the end, the man assumed killed in the van comes back from the dead covered in blood and with his clothes still smoking with fire. Make of it what you will. There can be no objections to the acting nor to the set and occasionally galactic lighting designed respectively by Neil Warmington and Rick Fisher. The piece is directed by Mathew Warchus, who is also responsible for the excellent Much Ado About Nothing still playing at the Queen's Theatre in Shaftesbury Avenue. For the first 10 minutes or so, Marvin's Room looks like a pleasant surprise: a re-run of Doctor in the House transposed to Florida. There is a wonderfully bumbling doctor called Wally, played by Ian Gelder. Yet the fun for fun's sake does not last. The play is an American soap written impeccably to formula. Laughs and sobs come in almost equal proportions. A woman is dying of cancer, having nursed her sick father for over 20 years. The estranged family gather round. There are two boys, one goody, one baddy, even a trip to Disneyworld to bring the family together. Sentimentality reigns: patches of Carousel without the music. The performance by Alison Steadman as the dying woman is immaculate and I much admired Carmel McSharry as her Aunt Ruth. Directed by David Petrarca, Marvin's Room is a model of its kind made more poignant by the knowledge that the author died of Aids last year. If someone could combine the professionalism of Room with the occasional volcanic energy of Stuff, there might be a very good play.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 8 Apr (XINHUA) -- A concerned department  of the State Council today issued a circular on readjusting the  plan for launching the first "Fengyun 2" satellite. The text of  the circular is as follows:    China originally planned to use its Long-March 3 carrier  rocket to launch the first "Fengyun 2" stationary meteorological  satellite at the Xichang Satellite Launching Center in the near  future. But, because an accidental event took place in the  process of testing the satellite in the technical zone, damaging  the satellite and workshops, the launching plan has been  readjusted. China will make great efforts to complete the  follow-up work to ensure the completion of other satellite  launching plans for this year.</p>

			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / Mikhail Gorbachev now an ordinary citizen Unnoticed and unmourned by his own people, Mikhail Gorbachev was the centre of media attention yesterday when he arrived for his first day of work as an ordinary citizen after six years as the Soviet president, writes Leyla Boulton in Moscow. His first appointment could not have been more appropriate. It was with Dr Henry Kissinger, the former US secretary of state, a fellow elder statesman who helped change the face of international relations with an earlier round of superpower detente. Mr Gorbachev now plans to combine an unspecified dose of politics with public speaking, writing and research. Since he was pushed out of the Kremlin by Russian president Boris Yeltsin last month, he has moved to a three-room apartment in south-west Moscow with his wife Raisa. It is close to his new office as chairman of the so-called Gorbachev Fund, an international centre for political, social and economic research. Mr Gorbachev may still provide a few surprises. Thirteen top government officials and army commanders involved in the August coup were formally charged yesterday with conspiring to seize power. Some Russian officials have suggested that the 13 have potentially explosive material on the former Soviet leader. Newspapers have speculated that Mr Gorbachev may be prosecuted for receiving intelligence reports on his political opponents while in power.</p>

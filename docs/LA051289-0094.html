			<p><P> May 12, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEW;  </P> <P> AKIYOSHI AND TRIO AT VINE ST.  </P> <P> Seven years have flown by since Toshiko Akiyoshi returned to New York, ending  the decade-long Southland residency that had brought her to poll-winning  eminence as composer, arranger and band leader. Now heard all too rarely with  an orchestra, she opened Wednesday at the Vine St. Bar &amp; Grill leading a  trio.  </P> <P> More correctly, she opened solo, since her drummer had not arrived. This  enabled her to remind us of the unaccompanied power and drama she can bring to  "The Village," a 5/4 composition she has been playing for 25 years. Duke  Ellington's "Come Sunday" offered her a chance to enrich the song's already  opulent harmonic nature.  </P> <P> With Eddie Marshall now manning the drums and Ned Mann on bass, pianist  Akiyoshi embarked on a series of pieces the three have obviously played often  together. A bopish tune at odds with its romantic title, "I Know Who Loves  You," reflected the perennial Bud Powell image that has been part of her  persona ever since she was a teen-ager in Japan studying the bop pioneer's  records.  </P> <P> "American Ballad" was a handsome revision of a song written for Britt Woodman,  who played trombone in her West Coast band. Woodman being an Ellington alumnus,  Akiyoshi tailored this piece along Duke-ish lines.  </P> <P> Although she is anything but a funk pianist, Akiyoshi invested Dizzie  Gillespie's "Con Alma" with strong, soulful rhythmic insights. Finally there  was another trio version of an early orchestral number, the piquant "Notorious  Tourist From East."  </P> <P> Marshall and Mann were consistently supportive as this unique jazz pioneer  belied her bashful personality with an hour of creative, innovative mainstream  sounds. She closes Saturday. LEONARD FEATHER  </P></p>

Bucharest--From our correspondent. Four years after the fall  of the communist regime, the very clear revival of social  disputes has thrown tens of thousands of demonstrators into the  streets in Romania and multiplied work stoppages in the public  sector during the second half of 1993. And, no doubt, the worst  is yet to come.    "Romanian trade unions are now reaching maturity. They have  passed the simple boundaries of salary claims, to which they had  limited themselves until recently, in order to tackle the  problem of economic transition." The opinion is that of Octavian  Partenie, an adviser to the prime minister in charge of  relations with the trade unions, and it appears to be confirmed.  The country's main federations of trade unions have, in effect,  just issued a call for a general strike to take place during the  last two weeks of January to protest the devastating effects of  the economic crisis and to demand that the government resign.    The issues leading to discontent among the workers are  legion. Even though the restructuring of the sprawling public  sector has not yet begun, the number of unemployed, according to  official counts, has already reached 10.4 percent of the  working-age population, but the true figure is doubtlessly much  higher. Prices have increased 300 percent this year, flattening  the savings and wages of a population that had already lost 40  percent of its purchasing power since 1989.    More than one-third of the Romanian people now live below  the  poverty line with an average monthly wage of less than 300  francs, according to government statistics. And clouds are  gathering on the horizon. The International Monetary Fund will  certainly extend a new credit of $700 million to Bucharest, but  that credit is accompanied by stern recommendations to  accelerate reform and to enhance budgetary rigor.  <H5>  "Not a Capitalist Model" </H5>   There are so many elements which probably will for the first  time burden the population and thus provide new battalions of  discontented people for the trade unions, which assert that they  have already attracted more than two-thirds of all wage-earners.  Nevertheless, their claims are not without a conspicuous paradox.    Riding the swelling waves of discontent, they have made  themselves champions of reform, even though that process could,  in the end, risk transforming the unions into a party of union  members. In essence, the restructuring processes have resulted  inevitably in a multiplication of failures. As for the 500,000  PME [private entrepreneurial family associations] created since  1990 and already responsible for 30 percent of the gross  domestic product, they are practically nonunionized.    Bogdan Hossu, the leader of Cartel Alfa, one of the main  confederations of trade unions, challenges this ambiguity: "We  defend the construction of a social economy based on the market  and not a South American-style capitalist model." To adapt to  the new environment in the country, the trade unions have  gradually tightened their ties with their base. A score of  confederations participated in the first collective negotiations  with the government in 1991. They now number less than ten, and  it is thought that in a few months there will not be more than  three or four which are truly representative.    In other respects, the unions profit today from the result  of  better means of communication. Mr. Hossu charges: "The political  parties are stalling, and the government has proved its  incapacity to resolve the crisis." According to him, the trade  unions are, therefore, "the only hope for the population," and  the unions do not hesitate to venture into the political  terrain. A few weeks ago, Miron Mitrea, the executive chairman  of the CNSLR-Fratia [National Confederation of Free Trade  Unions--Brotherhood], the other large workers' organization  along with Cartel Alfa and National Trade Union Bloc, called for  the formation of a "coalition cabinet," uniting an opposition  party and several groups of the existing majority. Since then,  the idea has been taken up again more widely.    Courted by the political parties, the Romanian trade unions  are raising the bids just when, exhausted by a difficult year,  the government's days appear to be numbered. Unless, that is,  the trade union quarrels and lack of unity do not allow the  souffle to collapse. The negotiations with the government,  lacking a common plan of action, as well as the more underhanded  question of dividing up the funds of the UGSR [General Union of  Trade Unions] (about 5 million francs), which was the only trade  union organization under the communists, have made the unions'  previous call for a general strike last May fail.    Since then, the trade union leaders have dominated the  dialogue. They manage the UGSR's war chest cooperatively, and it  was with a single voice that they called for mobilization to  take place in January, unless the consultations openned on 27  December by President Ilisecu with the leaders of the main  political parties, lead to a future reshuffling of the  government. The trade unions would then see their first demands  satisfied, but, for all that, the deep causes of social tension  would not disappear.</p>

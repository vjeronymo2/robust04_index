			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / Management: Christmas crackers - Jean-Louis Barsoux says the office party is a logical absurdity Why does the Christmas office party generate so many funny stories, so much corporate jokelore? The answer is that it has privileged status. Directors and senior executives are so afraid of laying themselves open to the miserable tag 'Scrooge', that they will put up with behaviour from employees that would warrant instant dismissal at any other time of year. Often described as an occasion when anything goes, there are breaches of acceptable behaviour and deportment which would normally shake the very foundations of the organisation. The Christmas 'do' provides an annual catharsis for the passions and paranoias that lie just below the surface of everyday office life. No corporate principle is left unturned. Business logic: companies are built on an ethos of thrift, logic and constraint. This is in marked contrast to the over-indulgence, recklessness and lack of control of the office party. Seasonal largesse is expected from the company - but such extravagance can seem indulgent in times of economic stringency. So clients and suppliers are rarely invited; to do so might simply re-enforce their contempt for the company. There is also a reversal in the customary respect for company property. The office and its immaculate furniture is converted into something resembling a Marseilles dock-side dive. Party-goers push desks together, climb on them, dance on them. They spill drinks and stub out cigarettes on the carpets. Status considerations: initially, the status quo prevails. Senior figures may seem a little stand-offish until they are sufficiently tanked up to mingle. Easy access to the boss at first guarantees a large crowd, but executive awe evaporates proportionately as wine and inadmissible desires take hold. The acolytes drift away from the once-compelling centrifugal figure. A new hierarchy emerges, built on charm and entertainment value. The group may then exercise collective pressure in getting the boss to don a paper hat and perhaps perform some embarrassing party piece. The boss will self-consciously oblige for fear of being labelled a party pooper - and may well over-compensate on the clowning in an attempt to establish street credibility. Loss of dignity is but the first casualty of the evening. Physical restraint: normally demure people shout hoarsely over the blaring music; those usually so aware of their body boundaries are suddenly given to extravagant semaphore; physical uprightness turns into slouching, into sitting on floors, then into lurching, sprawling and fumbling. Rational behaviour gives way to drunken exhibitionism. Colleagues, who would never usually lay a finger on one another, slap each others' backs and hug one another shamelessly. This is no place for the sober or the dutiful. Sexual decorum: normal rules applying to office encounters are suspended as excuses for contact are proffered: loud music requires close proximity of conversationalists, dancing may ensue, the bright strip lights are extinguished and sprigs of mistletoe materialise. The everyday concentration of people in typing pools, shop floors, and open-plan offices is subverted as individuals seek out the building's nooks and crannies; temporary elopers cavort in store cupboards or computer rooms and find novel uses for photocopiers. Interpersonal harmony: as the evening draws on, the enforced bonhomie may be interrupted by sporadic outbreaks of conflict. The seasoned campaigner vents his pent-up frustration at being passed over for promotion in favour of a young high-flyer with a thinly veiled joke, an insult, an emptied wine glass or even a scuffle. Not only is this yearly debauchery alien to the day-to-day idea of acceptable behaviour at work, it is also in contrast with Christmas in the domestic setting. Spiritual aspects of the season give way to one long round of grope, gossip and gripe. Christmas in the workplace owes more to the pagan Viking fertility rites of Yuletide than to Christianity. All this makes one wonder why companies persist in holding office parties. They are probably responsible for more distress and agonising, more resignations and damaged job prospects, than any other single event in the corporate calendar. They are psychological minefields, viewed by staff with a mixture of excitement and dread. Yet the truth is that many people derive a morbid enjoyment from grotesque self-revelation and unwise acts, even those that end in squalor, violence or regret. Twelve months, it seems, is long enough for selective amnesia to set in and for everyone to take their chances, once again, on the rollercoaster of merriment and disaster. The article is based on the author's recently published book Funny Business (Cassell: Pounds 25 hardback, Pounds 11.99 paperback)</p>

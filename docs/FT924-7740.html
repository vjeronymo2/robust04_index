			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Letter: Benefits of import reports Sir, Many companies report their direct exports. If companies were required to report their direct imports - classified as raw materials, semi-finished and finished products - it would increase our ability to pursue the goal of import substitution, and provide a great deal of information to manufacturing industry. Sir Ian Morrow, 2 Albert Terrace Mews, London NW1 7TA</p>

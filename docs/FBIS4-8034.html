			<p>BFN     [Text] In Warsaw, Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak held a  half-hour meeting with Slovak Foreign Minister Eduard Kukan, who  is on a working visit to our country.    [Correspondent K. Koziol] This is the first Polish-Slovak  contact at government level following the changes in the Slovak  Government. It is also the first trip of the new foreign  minister of Slovakia.    After the meeting, Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak told  journalists that he had discussed with the head of Slovak  diplomacy all matters linked to our cooperation, mainly the  agreements that have been prepared and are ready to be signed.    These are, said the prime minister, agreements regarding  economic cooperation, the safeguarding and support of  investments, and an agreement on double taxation.    The foreign minister of the Slovak Republic conveyed to  Prime  Minister Pawlak an invitation from Slovak Prime Minister  Moravcik to pay a visit to Slovakia. I am certain, said Kukan,  that my visit to Warsaw will speed up the legal regulation upon  which our relations are based.    From the Council of Ministers Office, Kukan made his way to  the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for a face-to-face meeting with  Minister Andrzej Olechowski.    At the same time, the two delegations are holding plenary  talks. This is Krystyna Koziol for the First Program.</p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] Hyderabad, Feb. 12--Nagarjunasagar in Nalgonda  district has been formally selected for the location of the  proposed nuclear power plant.    Mr S.K. Chatterjee, Managing Director, Nuclear Power  Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL), who is also the Chairman  of the site selection committee, said here on Saturday that he  would recommend to the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) for  locating the nuclear plant at Nagarjunasagar.    Speaking at a function organised by the Nuclear Fuel Complex  (NFC) in connection with the production of 1,00,000th [as  printed] fuel bundle used for pressurised heavy water type  reactors, he said Nagarjunasagar was the most suitable site in  the country for the establishment of the multi-crore project to  be taken up during the Ninth Five-Year Plan.    He said that a part of the project cost of Rs2,000 crore  would have to be shared jointly by Andhra Pradesh Government and  the NPCIL. Raising of funds for the project was an uphill task  and all efforts would be made in this regard. The cost per MW  would be Rs 4 crore for the project, which would have 2 x 500 MW  stations. The Andhra Pradesh Government gave a positive response  for establishing the plant in the State, he added. He, however,  hastened to add that there was still a long process for the  finalisation of the project, which among other things required  environmental clearance. The NPCIL was in touch with the Andhra  Pradesh Government and the State Electricity Board, he said.    Stating that the programmes of the NPCIL had slowed down due  to paucity of funds, he said the NPCI is now concentrating on  joint ventures with the States. In this regard, the NPCIL would  have a joint venture with Karnataka for establishing two  projects at Kaigah and Mysore.    Dr R. Chidambaram, Chairman, Atomic Energy Commission (AEC),  who inaugurated the NFC's productivity week celebrations, lauded  the organisation's achievements in the nuclear fuel cycle and  its dominant role in the country's peaceful nuclear programmes.    He asked the NFC to make all efforts to bring down the cost  of production and to adopt innovative methods to help produce  cost-effective material. "We have to improve the technology. We  will not be able to get nuclear technology from outside. There  is no dearth of talent, capability and commitment. But what we  lack is the speed. We now have to do things faster to keep pace  with the developed nations."    The NFC Chief Executive, Mr K.K. Sinha, who welcomed, said  the NFC had crossed yet other milestones in its cherished goal  of excellence by producing the 1,00,000th fuel bundle.    Stressing the need for accelerating the production, he said  there was a general feeling that the output from public sector  units was not commensurate with the investment on it and the  fruits were not reaching the people.    Dr N. Kondalarao and Mr K. Balaramamoorthy, former chief  executives of the NFC, said that the organisation grew from  strength to strength over the years and carved a niche for  itself in the area of excellence.    Dr Ravi Mallu, MP and president of the NFC Employees'  Association, urged the AEC chairman, Dr R. Chidambaram to  consider the demands of the employees which included risk  allowance, insurance coverage and nutritious food to those  working in the uranium unit and washing allowance to workers.    Later Dr R. Chidambaram handed over the 1,00,000th fuel  bundle to Mr S.K. Chatterjee.</p>

			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / International Company News: Bell Atlantic wins TV ruling BELL ATLANTIC, the large east coast telecommunications company, won an important legal victory which could make it the first US local telephone company offering cable television in its telephone service area. It said a US district court in Alexandria, Virginia, had declared unconstitutional a provision in the 1984 Cable Act blocking telephone companies from providing cable programming in areas where they provide a telephone service. The case, which seems likely to go to appeal, sets a legal precedent and may prompt other local telephone companies to mount similar cases. Bell Atlantic, one of the seven regional 'Baby Bell' telephone companies spun off in the mid-1980s from American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, filed suit last December in Alexandria against the US government agencies responsible for overseeing the 1984 Act. It wants initially to offer a cable television service to 60,000 customers in Alexandria, just across the Potomac River from Washington DC. The cable industry seems certain to appeal the ruling. The federal government could also object, although the executive branch has generally favoured breaking down regulatory barriers.</p>

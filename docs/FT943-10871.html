			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / Romanian miners may march Romanian coal miners, whose violent demonstrations in the capital have played a critical role in Romanian politics over the past five years, threatened yesterday to march on Bucharest if their demands were not met. Eighty thousand coal miners have been on strike since Thursday demanding that their wages be pegged to inflation, and 24 miners have begun a hunger strike. Mr Miron Cosma, a union leader, said that if any of the hunger strikers died, he would lead 200,000 miners in a raid on the capital. He also threatened to call a general strike. Thirty thousand copper miners have begun legal proceedings to join the strike. Negotiations between the government and the workers broke down over the weekend when the miners rejected a 7 per cent pay increase.</p>

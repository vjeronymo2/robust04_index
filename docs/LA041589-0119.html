			<p><P> April 15, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A GUY WHO'LL 'SAY ANYTHING'  </P> <P> If you are 22 and a rising film star, don't live in Malibu, and never qualified  for the Brat Pack by punching out a geek at a Hollywood punk-rock club, odds  are you'll be billed as a maverick.  </P> <P> John Cusack is such a person. He even lives in Chicago. This week he was in New  York, doing interview after interview to drum-beat for "Say Anything," a quirky  new romantic comedy that opened Friday.  </P> <P> Tall, polite, possessed of rapid-fire speech, he wryly complained about  "talking about myself for three weeks now." That an actor can so complain  indicates a fine outlook on life.  </P> <P> Another good sign: He has a Chicago theater company and talks of maybe  producing Dario Fo's "The Accidental Death of an Anarchist" or an adaptation of  Hunter S. Thompson's "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas."  </P> <P> Theater keeps you normal? "Yeah, it does. But you also have to keep a  perspective on the whole thing, to know that acting isn't the end-all of life."  </P> <P> In "Say Anything," he plays a decent, whimsical, boundlessly upbeat kid who  upon graduation from high school pursues and falls in love with the beautiful  class genius (Ione Skye).  </P> <P> All this time, he is planning a career in kick-boxing which, as he tells her  bemused, divorced father (John Mahoney), is "the sport of the future."  </P> <P> Other than that, the lad has no fixed address for the future, although he knows  that "I don't want to sell anything, buy anything or process anything."  </P> <P> Cusack, who has the innocent Irish face of a very big altar boy, beams when a  visitor ventures that his "Say Anything" character had the same exuberant  nonconformist spirit that Jason Robards showed in "A Thousand Clowns" more than  20 years ago.  </P> <P> "That's a great compliment," says Cusack, a fan of that film and that actor.  "I'm honored by that analogy."  </P> <P> He has been a busy man -- 12 films in six years, starting with "Class." His  dossier includes "Sixteen Candles," "The Journey of Natty Gann" and his first  starring role in "The Sure Thing" in 1985.  </P> <P> He didn't want to grow old in coming-of-age roles, though. So last year he did  John Sayles' "Eight Men Out," about the great baseball scandal of 1919, and  "Tapeheads," a black comedy about the music video business.  </P> <P> The latter was with his pal and ally in stage, Tim Robbins, who played the big  baseball player with the tiny brain in "Bull Durham."  </P> <P> Having bid adieu to to teen roles, Cusack initially said no dice when  approached for "Say Anything" by its director-writer, Cameron Crowe, the  ex-Rolling Stone scribe who wrote "Fast Times at Ridgemont High."  </P> <P> "I was worried about repeating myself and working with a first-time director,"  Cusack said. "I had a lot of trepidation."  </P> <P> He didn't want to be in another teen genre film. It took a while -- and the  fact that the film's executive director is James L. Brooks, writer-director of  "Broadcast News" -- before he said yes.  </P> <P> This is true, Crowe said in a separate interview. "He said, 'I've graduated' .  . . to his credit, though, he kept his foot in the water for a long time while  he got to know me. He didn't want me to make him what he calls the Charm  Monster."  </P> <P> The operative phrase for Cusack's character, indeed the film, is "optimism as a  revolutionary concept," a phrase director and actor have made sort of their  interview mantra.  </P> <P> In the movie, Cusack lives with his older sister -- played by his older sister,  Joan, the Staten Island secretary of "Working Girl" and frenzied production  assistant of "Broadcast News."  </P> <P> They are the best-known of five Cusack kids who grew up in Evanston near  Chicago and started acting with a local stage group, the Piven Theatre  Workshop. The other three -- Ann, Bill and Susie -- also are working in the  arts.  </P> <P> Their father, Richard, a documentary maker, also has taken up acting, appearing  in "Eight Men Out" as the stern judge who in a courtroom scene tells Cusack:  "You're out of order. Sit down and shut up."  </P> <P> Cusack has another new movie, "Fat Man &amp; Little Boy," which stars Paul  Newman, due out late this year. In it, he plays a nuclear physicist who worked  on the nation's first atomic bombs.  </P> <P> He mildly frets that he hasn't acted on stage for three years, although last  year in Chicago he directed a gonzo satire co-authored by Tim Robbins and Adam  Simon, "Alagazam . . . After the Dog Wars."  </P> <P> "It's about a small-time freak show taken over by a defense-entertainment  corporation," he said. "The show has a tough, honest pitchman who tells white  lies, but also showers the audience with bits of truth. . . . It's also about  how television has kind of centralized the nation and homogenized it -- the  same country sharing the same kind of images -- and how dangerous that can be."  </P> <P> What bugs him most about movie scripts he's offered?  </P> <P> That many of them "are just kind of devoid of any integrity or creativity, that  they're just a genre film. Genre to me means making money off someone else's  original idea.  </P> <P> "In Hollywood, it's really hard to take pride in what you do. You see the Oscar  ceremonies and it's like kind of a bad acid trip. . . . It's things like that,  and some of the scripts you get sent that really give you the fear, make you  think you don't want to be an actor."  </P> <P> It is unlikely that Cusack will move west soon, even though it is said that one  needs to live and take meetings in Hollywood or one will . . . well, just not  be happening. Cusack would disagree. That he has been in 12 films since age 16  would tend to support his position.  </P> <P> "Ah, I'm not really an L.A. kind of guy," he says. He does have a girlfriend  who lives in Los Angeles, singer Suzanne Melvoin, daughter of jazzman Mike  Melvoin. "I have a lot of friends out there, and there are a lot of good things  to be said about L.A. But I just don't feel like driving around in a car for  half a day.  </P> <P> "And I really do like the city of Chicago. I don't know if I'll stay there  forever. But it's doing just fine so far."  </P></p>

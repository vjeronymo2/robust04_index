			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / Names angry as underwriters continue to trade THE Lloyd's insurance market was criticised yesterday for allowing underwriters of two of the heaviest lossmaking catastrophe reinsurance syndicates to continue trading as active members. Mr Patrick Fagan and Mr Derek Walker are listed as Lloyd's Names - the individuals whose wealth supports the market - in the latest edition of the Lloyd's blue book, the publication that details Names' syndicate participations. 'Members who have been ruined by their activities will find it galling in the extreme that those responsible for their misfortunes can still attempt to trade out of their difficulties,' says an article in the newsletter published by the Association of Lloyd's Members, which represents some 9,000 Lloyd's Names. According to the 1993 blue book Mr Walker is a Name on 18 separate Lloyd's syndicates, while Mr Fagan is backing 11 separate syndicates. Names must show wealth of at least Pounds 250,000 to trade at the market. Both men resigned active participation as underwriters after their own syndicates crashed in 1990 and 1991. Mr Walker is also a leading figure in the Gooda Walker agency, whose affairs are being investigated by the Serious Fraud Office. Both are thought to have made heavy losses as a result of participation in their own syndicates, but will hope to make profits this year as rises in insurance rates revive prospects for profitability. The association says that underwriters of syndicates whose losses exceed 150 per cent of their capacity - the amount of premiums that syndicates are allowed to accept - should be suspended. Lloyd's said yesterday that it was unable to suspend Names for reasons of natural justice.</p>

			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / Kingfisher advances 4% despite sharp fall at B&amp;Q KINGFISHER, one of the UK's biggest retailing groups, reported higher than expected interim profits of Pounds 64.9m, representing a 4 per cent gain before tax and exceptional items. But the headline figure disguised a 10 per cent fall at the pre-interest level as profits at the B&amp;Q DIY chain were eroded by a fierce discounting war. Strong cash generation reversed the company's interest position yielding a Pounds 400,000 contribution against a Pounds 9.1m charge. The Kingfisher group, which also includes the Woolworths, Superdrug and Comet chains, said trading had been patchy and it expected no uplift in consumer spending this year. Mr Geoff Mulcahy, chairman and chief executive, said: 'A good month has been followed by a bad one. Some of our markets have looked stronger only to fade away again. It is a tough world out there for retailers and it is not going to get any easier.' He added: 'If your house price has fallen, you are afraid of losing your job, and you have high levels of personal debt you are bloody well not going to go out and spend money no matter where interest rates are.' Kingfisher's sales rose 4 per cent to Pounds 1.56bn in the six months to August 1 as the company claimed to have won market share in all its core markets. B&amp;Q saw operating profits fall from Pounds 46.4m to Pounds 40.1m but the company said its emphasis on 'everyday low pricing' should minimise the attractions of competitor discounts. Superdrug edged ahead by Pounds 300,000 to Pounds 12.8m; Woolworths, strongly weighted to the second half, contributed Pounds 800,000 (up from Pounds 200,000); and Comet reduced its losses to Pounds 500,000 (down from Pounds 2.8m). Kingfisher will spend Pounds 300m over the next three years on store improvements. Woolworths and Superdrug will be fitted with electronic point of sale systems and up to 60 B&amp;Q Depot format stores will be rolled out. Property development profits and investment income at Chartwell Land contributed Pounds 17.5m (down from Pounds 20.8m). An exceptional profit of Pounds 2.9m (against Pounds 8.1m) arose from retail property disposals. Earnings per share were static at 9.2p. But the interim dividend was lifted by 5 per cent to 4.2p. The shares closed unchanged at 474p. Lex, Page 22; Market, Page 40</p>

			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / World Bank urged to set up nutrition programme The World Bank should include nutrition schemes 'in every appropriate Bank project' in order to combat deficiencies in vitamin A, iodine and iron. Without these so-called micronutrients, development is hindered in many countries by the need to care for the more than 1m cases of blindness, mental retardation, learning disabilities and low work capacity, says a Bank report. The recommendation is contained in 'Enriching Lives' published by the Bank's human resources division, the fastest growing sector in the giant multilateral lending institution. The real growth in social programmes began a decade ago. Last year the Bank lent Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.8bn) for various health, education, population and social programmes. 'There came a general awareness that in order for us to make a real dent in poverty, we must attack basic problems like education and healthcare,' said Mr Klas Bergman, a Bank spokesman. According to the report, the cost of deficiencies of vitamin A, iodine and iron is enormous - as much as 5 per cent of a country's gross domestic product - in terms of deaths, disabilities and productivity. Remedies would cost an estimated Dollars 1bn a year, according to Mr Bergman. Bank lending last year totalled Dollars 20.8bn. The Bank next year will lend at least Dollars 60m for micronutrient projects, the biggest being in China.</p>

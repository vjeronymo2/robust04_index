			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 18 KYODO -- Japan has not received any  notice of a meeting of finance ministers and central bankers of  the Group of Seven (G-7) industrial nations in February, Finance  Minister Hirohisa Fujii said Tuesday [18 January].    "I haven't heard...and don't know," about such a meeting,  Fujii told reporters after a regular cabinet meeting. He was  referring to reports of a German proposal to hold a G-7 meeting  in late February.    Fujii also denied reports that he would be talking with U.S.  Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen on Sunday in Tokyo, saying, "I  have absolutely not heard of it...I learned of his (Bentsen's)  schedule for the first time through newspapers."    Concerning a meeting of finance ministers of the  Asia-Pacific  Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, Fujii said it will be held in  Hawaii on March 18 and 19 as disclosed by Bentsen on Monday.    The APEC meeting will be for "exchanging wide-ranging  views...and not for negotating policies," he said.    Turning to domestic issues, Fujii repeated that the timing  and size of an increase in the consumption tax must be included  in a package of tax reform bills for cutting income tax.    That is the "collateral" for issuing "bridge bonds" to  finance the tax cut, Fujii said, reiterating his strong  opposition to an issuance of "untreated" deficit-financing bonds.    The finance minister has retracted his objection to cutting  income tax before raising the consumption tax as a stimulus  measure on condition that repayment of bonds is guaranteed.    On Friday, disputes surfaced between the Finance Ministry  and  the Tax Commission over the sensitive issue of tax reform.    Kan Kato, head of an advisory panel to the prime minister,  told reporters that a simultaneous cut in income tax and  increase in the consumption tax rate is "not necessary,"  apparently opening the way for further objections to such a move  by the Social Democratic Party [of Japan] and some other parties  in the ruling coalition which oppose a tax increase.    But later Friday, Kato called a press meeting to retract his  comments after they drew strong objections from the ministry.    Meanwhile, Fujii welcomed decisions by the coalition parties  to drop a proposal to use public funds to purchase land as a way  to stimulate the real estate market.    "I believe the decisions are correct...because the  government  can't win public support," he said, pointing to the easing of  regulations as one of a number of measures and saying his  ministry is still studying what actions can be taken.    He also rejected any changes in the land tax.  (endall) 180219 foad DF131801.007 ym 18/0244</p>

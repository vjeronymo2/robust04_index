			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / Champagne loss hits LVMH LOSSES in the champagne business were the main reason for a 20 per cent fall in net profits at LVMH, one of the world's largest luxury goods groups, in the first half of the year. Profits slid to FFr1.03bn (Pounds 116.3m) from FFr1.29bn in the first six months of 1992. Mr Bernard Arnault, chairman, last month warned of a fall in first-half profits, but did not specify how steep. However, he also said he hoped that profits would at least be maintained in the full financial year. News of LVMH's decline comes at a sensitive time for the luxury goods industry, which has been badly affected by recession and changing consumer tastes. Gucci, another leading group, is in turmoil as Mr Maurizio Gucci, chairman, struggles to break the deadlock on control of the company. LVMH, which owns a string of prestigious products including Christian Dior perfumes, Hennessy cognac and Louis Vuitton luggage, increased sales by 3.6 per cent in the first half to FFr10.04bn. Turnover rose in every area of activity except champagne. The champagne division, including the flagship Moet-et-Chandon brand, saw sales fall 7.4 per cent to FFr1.8bn and made a net loss of more than FFr100m because of weak demand and rising raw material prices. Perfume was the strongest sector, with sales rising 12.4 per cent to FFr2.86bn, reflecting the success of new products such as Dior's Dune and Givenchy's Amarige. Luggage sales rose 4.6 per cent to FFr2.43bn with cognac and spirits sales up 2.3 per cent to FFr2.55bn. LVMH also suffered from the impact of the strong franc on its international interests, particularly in the UK. Gucci deadlock, Page 23</p>

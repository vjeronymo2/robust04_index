			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, June 20 (TANJUG) -- Serbia's riverboat  shipyards are operating at barely one-fifth capacity because of  the two-year-old economic sanctions against Yugoslavia.  According to the Serbian Chamber of Commerce, work at 10  shipyards in Serbia has ceased, resulting in lost revenues of  about 150 million German marks. The chamber said Monday that the  6,000 employees in the shipbuilding sector could build about 300  million German marks worth of ships a year, providing work for  another 150,000 workers in industries ranging from the iron and  steel to electrical sectors. The chamber group dealing with  shipbuilding has announced plans for constructing a new river  fleet over the next several years. The government will put up 40  percent of the funds, with rest coming from shipyards, customers  and banks.    Before the imposition of the UN sanctions, Yugoslav  shipyards  spent about 80 percent of their time on production for export,  with many Yugoslavs working overseas on such ships. The chamber  group said that today, most Yugoslav ships that had been based  abroad are moored in dock, where they are steadily decaying and  have lost their navigation permits. According to the  Jugoregistra register of shipping, only 360 of a total of 906  Yugoslav vessels still hold valid permits. Serbia previously  had one of the largest fleets on the Danube.</p>

			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Lloyd's agency to be closed Hogg Group, the insurance broker, yesterday placed KC Webb (Underwriting), one of its Lloyd's members' agency subsidiaries, into creditors' voluntary liquidation. Like its rival broker, JIB Group, which liquidated the Christand agency earlier this month, Hogg said it was concerned about the size of contingent claims faced by the agency after the failure on February 14 of the insurance market's Pounds 900m out-of-court settlement offer. The rejection of the deal means that a series of cases by loss-making Names, the individuals whose assets support the market, are expected to go ahead. Hearings in a case by about 350 Pulbrook Names against their agents started in the High Court yesterday, the first case covered by the offer to come to court. Mr Anthony Howland Jackson, chairman of Hogg, said the decision did not affect the right of Names to make claims against the company and that its errors and omissions insurance - covering agents against the cost of legal awards - remained intact.</p>

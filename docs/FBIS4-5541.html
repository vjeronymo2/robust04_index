			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 8 (KCNA) -- Deputies to the state  Duma of the Russian federation expressed deep concern over the  situation of the Korean peninsula which had been brought back to  an acute phase.    A joint statement was released on April 4 by seven deputies  including the Deputy Speaker of the state Duma, A. Vengerovsky,  and the chairman of the committee for issues of social  federations and regional organizations of the state Duma, V.  Zorkaltsev, with regard to the grave situation currently created  on the Korean peninsula.    The joint statement said: "We are surprised and angered at  the fact that some quarters of the United States, seeking the  establishment of a so-called `new world order', have raised a  new unjustifiable condition to our traditional ally, the DPRK,  and are increasing the tension again, threatening that they will  resume the `Team Spirit' joint military exercises with South  Korea and not come to the third-round of the DPRK-U.S. talks."    The joint statement called upon the DPRK and the U.S. to  take  all necessary steps to continue the talks for guaranteeing peace  on the Korean peninsula.</p>

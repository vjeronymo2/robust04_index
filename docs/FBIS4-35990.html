			<p>BFN     [Text] PRC Vice Foreign Minister Tian Zengpei arrived in  Damascus today on a visit to Syria that will last for several  days. He was received at Damascus International Airport by  Rislan 'Allush, the assistant foreign minister, a number of  Foreign Ministry officials, and the PRC ambassador in Damascus  and embassy staff.    In a statement to the SANA correspondent, Tian Zengpei  expressed his extreme happiness at visiting Syria and said:  China and Syria are two friendly countries whose peoples are  tied by traditional friendship. Over the past 38 years of  diplomatic relations between our two countries, our friendship  and cooperation witnessed satisfactory progress based on the  five principles of peaceful coexistence. Our two countries  continued to exchange sympathy and support on the international  arena, holding close or identical views on many important  international issues.    The Chinese official said: Increasing visits and  consultations between our two countries in this age, which is  characterized by a changing international climate, assumes great  importance for increasing understanding and strengthening  friendship. I am looking forward to meeting with the Syrian  officials concerned to exchange views on international and  regional issues of common concern and to look for ways of  developing bilateral relations. I will witness the great  achievements realized by the Syrian people under the leadership  of President Hafiz al-Asad in the field of expanding national  production and developing the country.    Concluding his statement, Tian Zengpei said: I am certain  that this visit of mine will contribute toward further  increasing and strengthening ties of cooperation and friendship  between our two countries.</p>

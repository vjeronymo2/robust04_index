			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Ivan Podstupka: "Second Wave in Fall; News </F> Conference at the Ministry of Privatization"]    [Text] Bratislava--The Ministry for the Administration and  Privatization of National Property [MSPNM] called a news  conference yesterday, the first after three months, at which  State Secretary Ivan Lexa provided information on key aspects of  the privatization process.    The first wave of privatization ended last October. The  privatization objectives of the first wave were fulfilled, with  the exception of 30 enterprises. Ivan Lexa contested views to  the effect that privatization has slowed down and those  expressing doubts about its transparency. He said that, since  15 July 1993, when the ministry started working in its new  composition, the process of privatization has accelerated six  times. A total of 100 privatization projects have been approved  since then, 35 of which were direct sales. Another 70  privatization projects are waiting for the National Property  Fund [FNM] to invite or evaluate a public tender. The state  secretary pointed out that neither the government nor the MSPNM  can accelerate the process, which is in the hands of the FNM.  The MSPNM was dissatisfied with cooperation with the FNM  Executive Committee, and changes in the FNM bodies have  established prerequisites for the situation to improve. Some  new methods should make privatization more transparent. Prices  will be set according to a new expert's standard and will be  monitored by the Supreme Inspection Office. Financial Police  will check potential buyers of property, how they meet their tax  obligations, the purity of their previous operations, etc. The  ministry also calls on the trade unions to send to it signals  regarding the professional qualities and irreproachability of  current managers who want to privatize their company.    According to Ivan Lexa, the personnel ties between the MSPNM  and the FNM as contained in the government bill on privatization  are warranted. The MSPNM is preparing another important  bill--on holdings. The bill's key issue is the legal  codification of taxation, as the double taxation of proceeds  from shares must be prevented.    Speaking about employee-held shares, Ivan Lexa said that, in  its policy statement, the government pledged to support  employees' wider participation in privatization. He cited Sigma  Zavadka, Topvar Topolcany, and JAS Bardejov as successful  examples of companies privatized by their employees. In the  Tlaciarne Bratislava [Bratislava Printing Works], the initiative  was seized by middle-level managers, who already own 51 percent  of shares. He also said that the method of allocating a part of  the shares for the management and another part for employees had  good prospects.    Asked by PRAVDA about the form and the date of the second  privatization wave, Ivan Lexa said that registration [of coupon  books] is planned for the last quarter of 1994. It is necessary  to beware of the all-or-nothing approach [mantinelizmus], to  which led the endeavor to comply at any price with the federal  deadlines for the first privatization wave. The method of  privatizing individual enterprises will be assessed more  thoroughly [than in the first wave]. A specific owner will be  sought first, and only then [when a specific buyer is not found]  will the coupon method be used. Property worth 50-70 billion  korunas [Sk] will be privatized in the second wave of coupon  privatization. The MSPNM is to submit its material on the  second wave to the government by the end of February 1994.    A concept is being prepared on how to privatize the Sk47.7  billion worth of securities still held by the FNM. The state's  permanent participation [in companies, in which the FNM holds a  stake] will be reassessed and limited as much as possible.  FNM-held shares will be sold either directly or by means of  public tender, and smaller remainders will be offered for sale  on the stock exchange or on the RM-System market. However, the  state secretary pointed to the risk of disturbance in the market  if too many securities were to be sold at once.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To resolve these problems, the Council identified the following priorities: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Ensure that [the] shore-based sector has reasonable opportunity to participate; (2) foster stability of shore-based processing sector by providing replacement revenues for other faltering fisheries; (3) help stabilize faltering rural coastal economies by providing fishing, processing and supporting industry revenues to replace income declines in other industries; (4) achieve maximum net benefit to the nation by putting economic benefits directly into coastal communities and distributing income impacts/benefits along traditional geographic paths; (5) spread fishery over time and area, reducing potential pulse fishery impacts on whiting, salmon and rockfish stocks; (6) prevent effort shift to other species; (7) address management of the entire groundfish resource rather than piecemeal; (8) contribute to increased long-term product yield and employment opportunities by spreading harvest over a longer season; (9) discourage additional capital investment in harvesting or processing facilities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Council convened an ad hoc industry subcommittee in July 1993 in Portland, Oregon, to develop an allocation option that would be acceptable to all sectors. The subcommittee included a representative from each major sector in the whiting industry: catcher vessels delivering at-sea, shoreside, and ``at-large;'' shoreside processors; catcher/processors; and mothership processors. The ad hoc committee, after considering a number of alternatives, successfully negotiated a 3-year agreement that was acceptable to all participants, and subsequently was adopted by the Council and recommended to the Secretary (Option 1 in the EA/RIR or the proposed rule).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Council's recommendation provides that the first 60 percent of the annual whiting harvest guideline will be available to all vessels in open competition. The remaining 40 percent is reserved initially for shore-based activities. When the 60 percent has been harvested, no further at-sea processing will be allowed for the remainder of the year or until August 15, when an additional portion of the harvest guideline may be made available. NMFS will assess how much of the harvest guideline will be utilized by shore-based processors during the remainder of the year, and any surplus to shore-based needs will be made available to all permitted vessels on August 15. The allocation would remain in effect for 3 years, 1994&hyph;1996. Any Pacific whiting harvested or processed in state ocean waters (0&hyph;3 nautical miles offshore) will be counted toward the EEZ limits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Council also considered the alternatives of continuing the 1993 percentages (of 30 percent for vessels delivering shoreside and 70 percent for at-sea processing (Option 2 in the EA/RIR), and continuing the ``olympic''-style fishery with no allocations to either sector (Option 3 in the EA/RIR).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ad hoc committee also reached a consensus agreement to assume that only the traditional whiting catcher fleet (limited entry vessels with ``A'' permits) would be allowed to operate in the whiting fishery. The Committee believed that the limited entry fleet, which contains approximately 40 catcher vessels from the traditional whiting fishery and possibly one catcher/processor, is sufficient to harvest any likely harvest guideline for whiting in the next 3 years. However, NOAA cannot foresee what choices fishermen will make and cannot guarantee that the entire harvest guideline will be taken by the current limited entry fleet. Participation in the limited entry fishery is determined under Amendment 6 to the FMP, which allows for participation by vessels that are not in the current limited entry fleet (by issuance of ``designated species B permits''), based on seniority in the fishery, if the current limited entry fleet will not use the entire harvest guideline. Therefore, the FMP provides for temporary participation by vessels that do not have ``A'' permits to ensure that the harvest guideline for whiting will be fully utilized.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Impacts of the Proposed Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The socio-economic framework in the FMP, under which this action is taken, requires the Council to consider a number of factors in its recommendation to directly allocate the resource among users. (See section III.C.3 of the appendix to 50 CFR part 663.) One factor that must be considered by the Council is ``any consensus harvest sharing agreement or negotiated settlement between the affected participants in the fishery.'' However, the fact that an agreement has been negotiated is not in itself a sufficient basis for the Secretary to approve the Council's recommendation. The socio-economic framework also requires consideration of a number of biological, social, and economic factors, as well as consistency with the goals and objectives of the FMP, the Magnuson Act and other applicable law. These factors are more fully discussed in the Council's EA/RIR (see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) and are summarized below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

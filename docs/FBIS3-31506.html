Voting on the entirety of the 1994 draft budget law is  scheduled for Friday.    The committee also accepted government-proposed amendments  to  the budget law, under which spending and revenue was increased  by 3 trillion zlotys to 696 trillion and 613 trillion  respectively.    On the motion of deputies of the ruling coalition, the  committee did not vote on motions providing for increasing  revenue except for one motion filed by the Health Committee  envisaging increased excise tax on cigarettes and alcohol. The  planned price rises would bring in revenue of 6 trillion zlotys  but the motion was rejected by the committee.    The committee did not accept either any motion for  decreasing  spending and made only minor shifts in funds between ministries.  The Labour Ministry was granted additional 1.5 trillion zlotys,  while over 0.5 trillion was earmarked for Walbrzych, Lodz and  Katowice provinces.    In the near future, the committee is to vote also on  "guidelines for privatisation in 1994" and on "guidelines for  monetary policy in 1994".    At a joint meeting on Wednesday, the Sejm Legislative  Committee, the Committee for Education and for Agriculture  accepted deputy-proposed amendments to the law on the system of  education including amendments sponsored by the government.</p>

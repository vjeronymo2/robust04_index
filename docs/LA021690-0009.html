			<p><P> February 16, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE HIGHS AND LOWS OF CARTAGENA  </P> <P> One cannot escape the feeling that President Bush headed in the wrong direction  in the effort to address the drug problem by traveling to Colombia. Rather that  going there to tell foreign presidents what to do to their countries to solve  our problem, it would be symbolically more precise to have them come here,  where both the problem and its solution ultimately are to be found.  </P> <P> Sure, cocaine production in the Andean nations is part of the problem. The very  fact that Bush and the presidents of Colombia, Bolivia and Peru had to huddle  in a colonial fort at the heavily guarded Colombian naval academy in Cartagena  vividly suggested the extent to which those three nations have serious problems  with the drug cartels.  </P> <P> But despite all their concerns, many Latin Americans resent the heavy hand of  the gringo superpower to the north; they resent the hypocrisy of being asked to  divest themselves of one of their few cash-rich crops; they fail to understand  the dispatching of troops and ships to waters off the Colombian coast when the  real drug battlefront is the cities of America, where drug traffickers control  too much territory, terrorize too many frightened Americans and hook too many  future mothers and present children on cocaine.  </P> <P> Perhaps it might have been more effective for the President to hold the drug  summit in Watts, or in Bedford-Stuyvesant in New York City, or even in  Washington, D.C., not that far from the White House, where the city's mayor was  indicted on Wednesday for drug use. For the point cannot be driven home too  strongly that international trafficking will not more than marginally wind down  unless the lucrative market in illicit drugs is dried up by some genius  combination of enforcement, education and rehabilitation.  </P> <P> This is not to deplore the Cartagena summit. Hardly. The very agenda items --  crop substitution, increased U.S. aid, the unfortunate U.S. export of  drug-processing chemicals, the use of the U.S. military in the drug war and  other initiatives -- were well worth discussing. But while Colombia is  certainly close to the problem, it is also far away from it: The most important  front is here. We won't taste the fruits of victory in fighting drugs until we  blame foreigners less for the problem and do more to clean up our own act at  home.  </P></p>

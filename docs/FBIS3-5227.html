The program, disclosed by Kim and  adopted by the Workers' (Communist) Party at its Central  Committee meeting on Feb. 25, 1964, provided several approaches  to rural woes, which were classified as agricultural problems in  one group and farmers' problems in the other.    Under a resolution adopted by the Workers' Party at its  Politburo meeting in October last year, North Korea held  meetings, ceremonies and other functions late last month to  observe the 30th anniversary of Kim's socialist agriculture  program.    A national meeting of farmers was held in Pyongyang from  Feb.  25-28, along with film shows and discussion meetings across the  country. In addition, commemorative stamps and postcards were  issued and cooperative farms with excellent production records  honored. On Feb. 23, Haksan cooperative farm in Pyongyang  dedicated a monument to the program's 30th anniversary.    Attending the opening session of the four-day national  meeting of 10,500 farmers were President Kim Il-song, People's  Armed Forces Minister O Chin-u, Premier Kang Song-san, Vice  Presidents Yi Chong-ok and Pak Song-chol, and Party Secretaries  Kye Ung-tae, Han Song-yong and Choe Tae-pok. But Kim Chong-il,  son and heir-apparent of the senior Kim, did not show up.    In a report lasting one hour and 20 minutes, Premier Kang  called on all cooperative farm workers to pursue reforms and  agricultural advances, while upholding the party's  agriculture-first policy. "We must make an uninterrupted  movement forward along the revolutionary path" charted in  President Kim's socialist agriculture program, Kang exhorted.    Kim Il-song, in a letter to the meeting, called for  intensified ideological reform among farmers, a switch from  cooperative ownership of farmland to a popular ownership system  and increased farm production, while stressing the need to  industrialize farming and incorporate farmers into the  proletariat.    Participants in the meeting spent three days discussing the  tasks laid out by Kim in his letter and resolved to carry them  out.    At the closing session on Feb. 28, they pledged their  loyalty to Kim Il-song and his son, Chong-il.    North Korea's media, both print and electronic, played up  the  functions celebrating the 30th anniversary of the senior Kim's  socialist farm program and the agricultural achievements of both  Kims.    In a commentary aired on Feb. 25, Radio Pyongyang attributed  the North's agricultural development in the past 30 years to  Kim's socialist farm program and said it had been carried out  successfully thanks to Kim Chong-il's "ideological and  theoretical activities and sagacious leadership."    The Workers' Party newspaper, NODONG SINMUN, praised the  Kims  for their "solution of basic rural problems," while calling on  farmers to perform the tasks President Kim mentioned in his  letter to the national meeting of farmers.    In 1974 North Korea started holding an annual meeting of  farmers in the off-season, which was changed to a meeting every  five years in 1985. The 1995 meeting was moved up to this year  to coincide with the 30th anniversary of Kim's agriculture  program announcement.    Kim senior and junior were acclaimed during functions held  at  the turn of the month, as with past events in North Korea. No  measures to develop the North's backward agriculture were  mentioned, though farmers were urged to uphold the agricultural  development concepts presented by Kim Il-song.    In spite of chronic food shortages due to several lean crop  years, North Korea failed to present a realistic and effective  farm development policy on the 30th anniversary of Kim's  socialist agriculture program, instead sticking to past policies  which have proven a dismal failure over the past 30 years.    While celebrating the 30th anniversary of the program, North  Korea failed to draw up effective measures to increase farm  production. Rather, farmers were simply exhorted to follow  blindly the policy Kim launched three decades ago.</p>

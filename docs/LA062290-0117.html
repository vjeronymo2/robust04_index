			<p><P> June 22, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NO CREDIT CRUNCH IN U.S., BANKING REGULATORS INSIST  </P> <P> Federal banking regulators said Thursday that they see no evidence of a credit  crunch in the United States, despite complaints in some regions that a federal  crackdown in the wake of the savings and loan scandal has caused lending to dry  up.  </P> <P> In testimony before the Senate Banking Committee, Federal Reserve Board  Chairman Alan Greenspan said any tightening by banks "does not appear to have  been widespread" and has not been severe enough to become a drag on the  economy.  </P> <P> He also suggested that the steps regulators took earlier this summer to ward  off lender panic appear to have worked. But he added that customers with  questionable credit-worthiness will -- and should -- have difficulty obtaining  loans.  </P> <P> Greenspan's assessment was supported by officials of the other top financial  regulatory agencies -- the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., the Office of  Thrift Supervision and the Comptroller of the Currency.  </P> <P> They conceded that some banks may have tightened lending practices too severely  a few weeks ago, but they insisted that such cases were isolated and were not  regulators' intent.  </P> <P> It was not clear what implications, if any, Greenspan's assessment might have  for broader money-and-credit policies -- specifically, whether the Fed, the  nation's central bank, continues to hold its ground on interest rates.  </P> <P> Backed by a solid majority of the Fed's policy-setting Federal Open Market  Committee, Greenspan has adamantly refused to nudge interest rates down further  -- for fear of reigniting inflationary expectations.  </P> <P> It remains to be seen whether the recent perception that there has been a  "credit crunch" -- and the temporary retrenchment by some banks, particularly  in New England -- will persuade the panel to ease up on the reins.  </P> <P> Thursday's hearing was scheduled in response to what lawmakers said was "a  barrage of letters and telephone calls" from constituents complaining about the  sudden reluctance of their banks to renew old loans -- or make new ones -- that  they had willingly made before.  </P> <P> Some Bush Administration officials have contended that the United States is  suffering a credit crunch. Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher and Housing  Secretary Jack Kemp have voiced such views, though the White House has kept  silent on the issue.  </P> <P> Although the senators generally conceded that free-wheeling lending was a major  factor in the S&amp;L problem, many insisted that regulators be on guard to  make sure banks do not overcompensate.  </P> <P> "Erring on the side of caution should not become an excuse for being too  tough," warned Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.), whose state has been among the  hardest-hit during the recent economic slowdown.  </P> <P> Regulators insisted that any excessive retrenchment by banks was not at their  bidding. "We haven't told bankers not to make loans, and we haven't told them  to cut off credit from good customers," Comptroller of the Currency Robert L.  Clarke said.  </P> <P> "We have reminded them to take care in making loans and, where necessary, we  have required banks to recognize weaknesses in their portfolios and management  systems."  </P> <P> Greenspan told the committee that the bulk of any cutback in lending has been  in financing of corporate mergers and restructuring and in lending to highly  leveraged borrowers, which the banks have begun to consider too risky.  </P> <P> He also cited increased difficulty by developers and builders in obtaining  loans for commercial construction -- a move that he said was designed partly to  compensate for "lax lending standards" in the past.  </P> <P> But Greenspan insisted that "there are no indications" that home mortgages have  become more difficult to obtain. He said interest charged on home mortgages has  not risen more rapidly than that for other categories of loans. And  down-payment requirements are unchanged.  </P> <P> FDIC Chairman William L. Seidman, whose remarks were read by an aide while  Seidman lay in a hospital bed recovering from a horseback-riding accident, said  most of the small businesses that are experiencing difficulties are troubled,  unprofitable or "shaky."  </P> <P> "In our view, banks are to be applauded for tightening lending standards," he  asserted. "Applying traditional prudent lending standards to this kind of  borrower is a sound practice."  </P></p>

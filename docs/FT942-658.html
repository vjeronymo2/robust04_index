			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Improved margins lift Business Post Improved margins in the second half helped Business Post Group, the parcel and express mail company which came to the market last July, raise annual pre-tax profits by 26 per cent to Pounds 5.3m. Sales for the year to March 31 rose by 24 per cent to Pounds 41.8m while operating profits advanced 11 per cent to Pounds 5.2m. The shares, which came to the market at 120p, fell sharply after the group last November reported a decline in first half margins. They closed 2p higher yesterday at 102p. Mr Peter Kane, chairman, said the group had continued to win business from its competitors and saw a 20 per cent increase in operating profits in the second half. 'The improvement in margins in the second half has continued into the first two months of the current year and I am confident that we shall make further progress as the business develops,' he added. The group had suspended development of UK Mail, its door-to-door hand-delivery business, in recognition of the time it would take for the government to finalise plans for privatisation of the Post Office. Earnings per share rose by 6 per cent to 7.5p (7.1p). A proposed final dividend of 2.7p makes a 3.7p (2.9p) total for the year, a rise of 28 per cent.</p>

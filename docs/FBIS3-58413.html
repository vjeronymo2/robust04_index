			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl in the </F> Bundestag in Bonn on 13 January -- live]    [Text] Madame President, Ladies and Gentlemen, the summit  meeting of the 16 NATO member states on 10 and 11 January in  Brussels was quite certainly a milestone on the path toward a  new security system for Europe after the end of the East-West  conflict. The summit yielded four essential results:    First, NATO emphasized the close ties between North America,  in particular the United States, and Europe.    Second, cooperation between the Atlantic alliance and  European Union will be considerably intensified.    Third, NATO is offering a Partnership for Peace to the  countries of Central, East, and southeast Europe, as well as to  the successor states to the Soviet Union.    Fourth, the alliance has given a clear signal that NATO is  open for new members.    The alliance has thus proved the central importance of NATO  as the cornerstone of security and stability, not only for the  members of the alliance, but, beyond that, for all of Europe.  [applause]    We as Germans, in particular, have experienced that the  strength and the solidarity of the alliance made a decisive  contribution to the end of the Cold War and the division of  Europe and Germany. This historic success of NATO is mainly  based on the firm security alliance between North America and  Europe.    In his great speech in Brussels City Hall on 9 January,  President Clinton affirmed that the partnership in the security  alliance with Europe remains a priority for the United States.  He also promised that some 100,000 U.S. troops would remain  stationed in Europe. In addition, he expressly praised and  recognized Germany's role for the establishment of a stable  peace system in Europe.    Ladies and Gentlemen, NATO unambiguously supports the  Maastricht Treaty and, thus, the further political unification  of Europe. This applies also to the efforts, which we all want,  especially we Germans, to develop an independent European  security policy and defense system with the help of the Western  European Union as the security policy branch of the political  union according to the Maastricht Treaty. Reservations in this  connection, which have sometimes been voiced in the past by some  representatives of the U.S. Administration, no longer exist.  [applause]    In the future, the Western European Union will be able to  rely on NATO forces for its own missions, if necessary.    The second significant result of our talks is NATO's  invitation to the young democracies in Central, East, and  southeast Europe and the successor states to the Soviet Union to  cooperate even more closely with us -- politically and  militarily -- within the framework of the Partnership for Peace.    At the same time, the Brussels summit also sent out the  signal that NATO is open to new members. We want to lead the  former communist nations in Central and East Europe gradually  closer to NATO, eventually even offering them membership, if  these countries so wish, of course. [applause]    This new approach is a historically unprecedented offer to  create a military alliance for comprehensive cooperation and  partnership with former opponents.    All states accepting this partnership will have the  opportunity to participate in joint military planning and  exercises. This includes joint training and participation in  international peacekeeping missions. With these measures, NATO  wants to contribute to establishing armed forces that are  committed to democracy and whose inner structures are comparable  with those of our armed forces.    Madam President, Ladies and Gentlemen, one of the central  elements of this program is the offer to enter into  consultations with partners if they fear a direct threat to  their territorial integrity, political independence, or  security. Our Partnership for Peace program is such that this  process can take place in a flexible, individual way, taking  into account other developments in Europe. Each country is  invited to contribute its share to this partnership. Our future  partners will be given the opportunity to codetermine the speed  and extent of approaching NATO according to their own interests.  [applause].    In view of the wishes of some of our East European partners  to become members, NATO is faced with difficult questions. We  understand the need for security and the fears of the people in  these countries. These fears are based on tragic experiences in  this century. In addition, the people in Central and East  Europe were longing for freedom and democracy during the years  of the Cold War. After the Iron Curtain came down, we  encouraged these countries to introduce democracy and a market  economy of the Western type. Therefore, their wish to join the  great institutions of the West is very understandable.  [applause]. At the same time, there are historically based  fears, especially in Russia, of isolation. We, and especially we  Germans, must take this concern seriously. [applause]. That is  why NATO is looking for comprehensive cooperation with Russia  and Ukraine in security policy and the military fields.    Ladies and Gentlemen, if we want to achieve this goal of  establishing a solid European security system, we all must take  account of these psychological features and security interests.  After our own experiences in this century, there must by no  means be new divisions in Europe. Security and stability in  Europe are indivisible. [applause].    That is why I think that disappointment or discouragement  about the decisions made at the NATO summit are not at all  appropriate. Our offer, which some countries have already  accepted, is an important step that is intended seriously for  the future NATO membership of the Central and East European  states. Today Germany has good relations with all countries in  Central and East Europe, including Russia. This gives us the  special opportunity to work toward this process constructively  on a bilateral basis. And our proximity to these countries, as  well as our special historic experience and responsibility  oblige us to do this. For me, an essential outcome of the  negotiations in Brussels is that the Atlantic alliance and the  European Union [EU] are working toward the same goal, namely to  include the young democracies in Central and East Europe in  existing Western communities. At the Conference of the European  Council in Copenhagen in June 1993, the EU offered concrete  perspectives for membership to our neighbors in the east. We  Germans especially want these countries to join. Yet, and this  has to be made clear as well, they themselves have to create and  meet the political and economic preconditions for membership.  [applause].    We do not want to forget that these prospects for  membership are of immediate significance in terms of security  policy. After all, under the Maastricht Treaty one of the  European Union's key objectives is to develop joint security and  foreign policy. These countries will, thus, get the opportunity  to participate in this development even before they become  members.    Ladies and Gentlemen; this policy primarily also corresponds  to our own vital interests in Germany. It is absolutely  inconceivable to me that the German-Polish border should remain  the eastern border of European political union forever.  [applause]    In the other reform countries of East Europe, the European  Union wants to develop relations in partnership on the basis of  appropriate treaties. The Federal Government is pressing to  conclude particularly the agreement with Russia as soon as  possible.    Madame President, Ladies and Gentlemen; for many people the  situation in the reform states, particularly in Russia itself,  is characterized by enormous social problems, economic misery,  and insecurity. The increasing crime and as yet insufficient  structures of a rule-of-law state constitute a heavy burden on  the people's day-to-day lives. They make economic reform  difficult, which, understandably, leads to tension in domestic  policy and even contributes to instability.    The election in Russia and the big success of extremist  forces are, therefore, a serious warning signal not only for the  Russian leadership but for all of us. We in the West, too, must  look even more closely than in the past at the immediate effects  of the economic reform on the Russian population.    At the Brussels summit we agreed that we must continue to  support the policy of political reform in Russia, which has been  personified by President Yeltsin since he took power. Despite  all justified concerns about the Russian election result, we  must not abandon our course. Progress must make itself clearly  felt, especially for the people, whose standard of living has  dramatically decreased in the recent past. [applause]    We must not, however, ignore the shrill extremist sounds  that  we can now sometimes hear from Moscow. This is the one side.  On the other hand, we should not contribute to dramatizing  things. The extent of the social, political, and economic  reorganization is absolutely unprecedented in history. A  totalitarian communist dictatorship ruled in Russia after 1917,  and, over the decades, generated a system that was hostile to  the people and economically inefficient. Lifting the burden  produced by such a regime takes time, courage, and incredible  energy. Given the enormity of the challenge, the process can  progress only slowly. The awareness of the people affected can  adapt to the changes only gradually, and setbacks are inevitable  in this process. Therefore, whenever we look at the  developments in Moscow and Russia, we should not apply our  traditional Western standards but show understanding for the  special situation there. [applause]    But we should not forget that, despite all the  difficulties, the reform process in Russia has also brought  about enormous progress. A majority of voters have given Russia  a democratic constitution for the first time. The forming of  democratic parties has begun; admittedly this has been quite  difficult. In certain fields of economic reform, for instance  with privatizations, we have seen the first successes. For me,  this means that we must not let up in our efforts to support the  reform process. What is of decisive importance is that we open  our markets for goods from the reform countries. Economic aid,  advice, and credits alone cannot bring about the desired  results, however, if the countries are not enabled to earn their  foreign currency themselves through exports. [applause] Of  course, we will have to expect the Russian Government to  continue conducting a policy of partnership, responsibility, and  constructive participation in solving international problems.  Hegemonic ambitions, of whatever kind, would be incompatible  with these expectations.    Madam President, Ladies and Gentlemen, the alliance also  agreed that Ukraine is an important partner for a future  European security system. Nuclear disarmament in Ukraine, as  laid down in the new agreement between Ukraine, the United  States, and Russia, will have to be effected as quickly as  possible. Ukraine's security cannot be guaranteed by nuclear  weapons, but only by close cooperation with its neighbors and  NATO. [applause] I think we agree in expecting and desiring  President Clinton's efforts in Kiev and Moscow to be successful.    Madam President, Ladies and Gentlemen, to safeguard peace  and  stability in Europe, existing borders must remain untouched and  minorities' rights be protected. The summit, therefore,  welcomed the EU's initiative to establish a stability pact in  Europe as an important contribution to peace and security. Over  the past months and years we saw old centers of tension in  Europe flare up and develop into bitter and bloody conflicts.  At the Brussels summit we also discussed the situation in  former Yugoslavia in detail. Safeguarding humanitarian supplies  to the people there must remain our first priority. The  alliance confirmed its readiness -- let me quote from the  declaration -- under the authority of the UN Security Council  and in accordance with the alliance decisions of 2 and 9 August  1993, to carry out air strikes to prevent the strangulation of  Sarajevo, the safe areas and other threatened areas in  Bosnia-Herzegovina    We will continue to try and achieve a political solution to  the conflict and will thus support the efforts on part of the  United Nations and the European Union. Unfortunately, the talks  between Croats and Bosnians in Bonn last weekend did not lead to  a breakthrough. Ladies and Gentlemen, people in many countries,  including Germany, think that the efforts to end the conflict  are insufficient. This is quite understandable. [applause]    In view of the terrible images we get to see in the  conflict area many people are asking themselves why the West  and, particularly, why NATO is not doing more to end the  conflict. I have great understanding for this question.  Nevertheless, I would like to point out here that people often  forget to what extent this war is dominated by hatred and  irrational behavior -- developments that did not build up  overnight but over decades or even centuries; and that all  military experts concur that a comprehensive intervention to end  the war with ground forces would require many hundreds of  thousands of soldiers. Such an operation would cause many  victims, even among the civilian population, and even then the  question would remain whether lasting peace could thus be  created.    The truth is -- and one can say it with anger and  bitterness,  but it remains the truth -- that there is no magic formula for  solving this conflict. We Germans, in particular, should be  very cautious as far as giving good advice to others. We do not  have the moral right to ask more from the responsible  authorities in other countries -- and this is what I experience  in my talks on a daily basis -- than what we do ourselves.  [applause]    When I look at my colleagues from France or Spain, who, as a  result of their operational orders, have to bear the  responsibility for the lives and the safety of young soldiers, I  know what I am talking about, and I think we all see that  similarly.    Nevertheless, we want to take any opportunity, including  today's, to thank these young soldiers from many nations and to  express our sympathy to them and their families. After all,  they are risking their lives in a difficult place for the cause  of peace. [applause]    Ladies and Gentlemen, the former Yugoslavia is only one  example, albeit the most terrifying one at the moment, that war  has not been banned from Europe forever. Therefore, the  development of a European peace system -- and let met put it in  even more straightforward terms -- therefore, political  unification is more important than ever. After all, the  European Union, which we want, is more than a mere economic  community, a community guided by the economic and financial  interests of its members. The deepening and simultaneous  extension of the European Union are decisive for the securing of  peace and freedom.    Ladies and Gentlemen, the fact that this year we can look  back at 48 years of peace, the longest period of peace in modern  history, also has something to do with the fact that people in  Europe have come closer together. In this sense, and with a  view to the next generation and what will come in the 21st  century, the question of European unity will always also be a  question of war and peace in Europe in this coming century.  [applause]    There is no alternative to such a policy or such a political  vision in the foreseeable future. [applause]    Madame President, Ladies and Gentlemen, the sober assessment  of the situation in Europe at the NATO summit clearly shows that  we will have to make our contribution to defending peace and  freedom in the future, too.    This means we need a Bundeswehr that is well-trained,  well-equipped, and highly motivated. [applause]. It means that  the capability to form alliances and be used in missions must be  safeguarded. [applause] Peace and freedom do not come free. We  all know that in view of the pressing problems the Bundeswehr  cannot be exempted from cuts. But we cannot, and must not, let  the operation of the armed forces be threatened by this.    Madam President, Ladies and Gentlemen, Europe is in a time  of  transition today. This transition goes hand in hand with great  challenges and insecurity. Especially in this difficult  situation we have to see and make use of the great opportunities  that have arisen for Europe after the end of the East-West  conflict. It is, therefore, an outstanding result of the NATO  summit in Brussels, that the Atlantic alliance and the Economic  Union are now combining their forces in order to lead the reform  states of East and Central Europe toward the existing community  and integrate them into it. This has always been a goal of  German foreign policy, and it will remain so. [applause]    It is also true, and must be said when we are speaking of  those days in Brussels, that the confidence of our friends and  partners in both West and East has grown, that we are trusted.  This international trust in the reliability and predictability  of German foreign policy is one of our most important starting  points for the future. It is an important asset. We have the  compass to keep the right course -- together with our friends  and partners -- in this transitional period that is so difficult  for Europe. The transition is difficult, but it offers many  more opportunities than the decades of the Cold War.  Opportunities to secure peace and freedom for our country, for  the people living here, and particularly for a free, open, and  democratic Europe. [applause]</p>

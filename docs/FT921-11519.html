			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Standard Life holds endowment bonuses STANDARD LIFE, the UK's largest mutual life insurance company, has maintained bonuses on its endowment policies. But it also sent a strong signal that bonuses could be reduced next year, by lowering the 'interim' bonus rates which would be payable to people claiming from the policies over the next year. The move means that pay-outs on 25-year policies, which are widely used to repay mortgages, are virtually static, increasing by about one third of 1 per cent from last year's figure. This should be enough to assure that Standard Life will retain its position as the industry's top investment performer over 25 years, and therefore the prospect that independent intermediaries will continue to favour the sale of Standard Life policies. However, the office made substantial cuts in pay-outs on 10-year policies, which were down by 8 per cent following a pronounced industry trend. The bonus rate on Standard's new 'unitised with profits' policies was cut from 9.5 per cent to 8.5 per cent. The move is also a significant development in a broadening debate among actuaries about how the weak returns of the last two years, and projected lower yields over the next decade, should best be reflected in pay-outs. Mr Scott Bell, managing director of Standard Life, said: 'Sterling's entry into the Exchange Rate Mechanism should lead to lower inflation and lower interest rates in coming years. As a consequence, during the 1990s, we can expect lower nominal investment returns than those achieved in the '80s.' He said that this was the reason for reducing interim bonuses.</p>

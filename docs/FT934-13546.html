			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Technology: Eyeing up the computer screen - Plans to link the human nervous system to PCs Move your eyes across the computer screen and the cursor follows faithfully. Choose a command by simply looking at the menu selection and blinking, and the computer responds. This might describe the most natural computer user interface of all, allowing eye movement to control computers and thus going beyond the present ubiquitous computer mouse and graphics icon systems which are based on technologies first described in the mid-1960s. If tiny BioControl Systems in California's Silicon Valley has its way, people will soon control computers by moving their eyes and 'thinking' commands. BioControl says it has developed a technology that links the human nervous system to a computer. Its BioMuse system can be programmed to interpret the user's biosignals - tiny electrical signals produced by the human body's nervous system. These can then be used to control a computer or anything controlled by one. Surgical equipment, for example, could be controlled by a surgeon's eye movements, allowing for delicate work to be performed. But what if the surgeon is distracted by something and looks elsewhere? Not to worry, says Anthony Lloyd, executive vice-president of BioControl Systems. 'The surgeon could simply clench his jaw. That would be the signal that would disengage the system, allowing the surgeon to move his eyes without danger of doing something unwanted.' A lightweight headband is worn, much like a sweatband. This contains a row of gel-based sensors which pick up and amplify signals from the nervous system and send them through a wireless connection to the BioMuse box. The BioMuse contains a powerful, eight-channel, digital signal processor which interprets the biosignals and maps them to whatever result the application requires. In one demonstration, the BioMuse is programmed to interpret the biosignals associated with moving the eyes to control a musical synthesiser. The user produces musical sounds by closing and opening the eyes, and moving them from side to side. The BioMuse can also interpret brain wave activities and be programmed to respond to different brain wave states, raising the intriguing possibility that users could 'think' commands. This is the focus of a research project at the University of Illinois which is using BioMuse technology to allow users to try to produce words on a computer screen by simply thinking them. BioMuse will also respond to muscle activity, allowing severely disabled persons to control their wheelchairs or other equipment through tiny muscle movements picked up by sensors mounted in a leg-band or arm-band. With forearm-based sensors, the BioMuse system could allow hand gestures to control a computer. This conjures up the intriguing possibility of frustrated computer users telling their computers exactly what to do with a simple hand gesture. Twenty organisations, including the US navy, US medical research laboratories and universities, have paid Dollars 10,000 (Pounds 7,142) for research and development licences to use the BioMuse technology in various applications. There is also considerable interest from European organisations, some of which have bought licences. These include Volvo Research in Sweden, Pigreco, an Italian animation company, and the University of Barcelona. 'There is a huge number of potential applications for this technology,' says Lloyd. 'The next step is reducing the BioMuse box to the size of a chip that can be mass produced.' Lloyd adds that a large Silicon Valley-based chip manufacturer is interested in producing the BioMuse chip. By shrinking the box's circuitry on to a chip, the BioMuse technology could be made cheap enough for a wide number of mass market applications.</p>

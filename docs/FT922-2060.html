			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / International Company News: Air Canada in aircraft sale AIR CANADA has put its five DC-8 cargo aircraft up for sale as part of efforts to rationalise its cargo operations, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal. Air Canada has failed to make its key domestic cargo operations profitable, partly because of the long recession. The airline saw overall cargo revenues slip to CDollars 354m (USDollars 297m) in 1991 from CDollars 413m in the previous year. Air Canada said it was selling the DC-8s to reduce debt and bring unit costs in line with other carriers. The five aircraft, which were used in Canada, are expected to fetch between USDollars 125m and USDollars 130m and should find a receptive market. Total cargo capacity will not change greatly after the sale because Air Canada this spring brought into service three new 747-400 combination passenger-cargo aircraft on its international routes. Air Canada also plans to sell its credit card operation for about CDollars 300m.</p>

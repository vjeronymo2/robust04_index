Gennadiy Ivanov, the chief of the  Directorate for Military Construction and Reforms, told our  correspondent Marian Chernukha how this program is being  assessed at the Russian Defense Ministry:    [Begin Ivanov recording] As our president recognized that  there is a need to join this agreement, we, the military, would  like to confirm that we are ready to do so, but Russia has its  own approaches. It does not mean that we should join the  Partnership for Peace on conditions set to us by NATO. We have  our own approaches and ideas. They do not run contrary to this  cooperation, but deepen it. We have difficulties. In  principle, this idea should be taken into account. We are  already bringing it into effect. This was confirmed by our  Foreign Ministry -- the military were never against it -- but  its forms and methods should be in the interests of both  European and Russian security. We do not oppose joint  exercises. We are not against joint symposiums and conferences.  We do not oppose the bodies that will be affiliated to NATO and  who could work out decisions jointly. We have already submitted  a plan -- it is in NATO now -- and we are waiting for a response  and results. [end recording]</p>

			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: London thrives as biggest foreign-exchange centre LONDON has continued to build up its position as the world's biggest foreign-exchange trading centre but its business is shifting to non-dollar currency trading and the forward markets, the Bank of England said yesterday. Reporting on a survey of foreign exchange activity in April this year, the Bank said total average daily turnover in spot and forward transactions increased to Dollars 303bn (Pounds 177.1bn), some 62 per cent higher than at the time of the previous survey in April 1989. London accounts for about 30 per cent of global foreign-exchange turnover of about Dollars 1,000bn a day. The US markets are the second most important, handling Dollars 192bn in currency transactions daily for a rise of 49 per cent over the three years, while the Japanese market ranks third with Dollars 128bn turnover, up 10.8 per cent. The survey found that the bulk of activity in London continues to be in trading sterling against the US dollar and in the D-Mark against the dollar. But while the dollar/D-Mark trade showed little change in market share since 1989, moving up slightly to 23 per cent from 22 per cent, sterling-dollar trading fell sharply to 19 per cent of total turnover from 27 per cent. Trading involving the D-Mark and currencies other than sterling grew over the three-year period. In another shift, the share of total turnover accounted for by spot business fell by 14 per cent to 50 per cent of the total, reflecting a big jump in the market share of forward trading to about 50 per cent. Forward trading volumes grew by 125 per cent from Dollars 65bn in 1989 to Dollars 146bn in 1992, while spot trading advanced 24 per cent to Dollars 147bn from Dollars 119bn. The main factor behind the expansion of forward trading was the growth of the swap market. The Bank surveyed 352 banks and investment houses and 13 brokers for its survey. It found activity had become more heavily concentrated among big players, with the 10 most active organisations holding a combined market share in London of 44 per cent compared with 35 per cent for the top 10 in 1989.</p>

The Movement Against Racism and for Friendship Between  People  said Azad Dere had been questioned by police in Paris on  Thursday and then ordered to remain at home in the south of  France.    Interior Minister Charles Pasqua signed an expulsion order  for Azad Dere on December 30 as part of a Europe-wide crackdown  on Kurdish activists.    Dere told AFP by telephone he had been detained while acting  as an interpreter for a visiting Kurdish delegation.    "My activities in France are perfectly legal," he said. "I  have a resident's permit that is valid until 2003."    Police have placed him under house arrest "until they can  find a country that will accept me after my expulsion from  France," he said, adding that the expulsion order was a result  of pressure from the Turkish Government.    On November 18, police carried out an operation against  Kurds  suspected of involvement with the Kurdistan Workers' Party,  which is fighting the Turkish Government for an independent  state.    Sixteen of the Kurds detained in the raids are still being  held and three others are under house arrest. Azad Dere slipped  through the net while he was attending a meeting of the European  Parliament in Strasbourg.    In a statement, the Movement Against Racism demanded Azad  Dere's immediate release, charging that "this new act of  complicity (with the government in Ankara) dishonored France."</p>

			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Virgin Atlantic starts libel case against BA THE LONG dogfight between Virgin Atlantic Airways and British Airways intensified yesterday with Virgin's decision to start a libel action in the High Court against BA and its chairman, Lord King. The libel action comes a week after Virgin announced it was taking legal action in the US against an alleged 'dirty tricks' campaign by BA against its smaller UK rival. Mr Richard Branson, Virgin chairman, said he was now starting legal proceedings in the UK because of BA's comments - in a newsletter, letters and a press release - on Virgin's allegations of 'unacceptable business practices' by BA. 'The manner in which BA and Lord King have attacked both Virgin Atlantic and myself, by dismissing Virgin's claims as fabrications, leaves me no choice but to proceed this way,' Mr Branson said. Virgin said writs were in the process of being served. Mr Branson has accused BA of attempting to undermine his airline through a smear campaign and by refusing to co-operate on engineering maintenance for his aircraft. He warned that he would take legal action if he did not receive an apology from BA, assurances from the bigger carrier to halt its alleged 'dirty tricks' campaign and the dismissal of Mr Brian Basham, a public relations consultant allegedly involved in the campaign. BA has repeatedly rejected Mr Branson's charges and has described his decision to take legal action in the US as a publicity stunt. Mr Branson said yesterday that he had done 'everything I can' to avoid two British airlines appearing in court against each other. BA's German deal, Page 12</p>

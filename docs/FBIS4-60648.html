			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with 'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani, member of the </F> Yemeni Presidential Council and assistant secretary general of  the General People's Congress, by unidentified correspondent in  Sanaa; date not given]    [Text] [AL-HAYAH] How will you reply to the Scud missile  fired on residential areas in the center of Sanaa Monday [23  May] evening?    ['Abd-al-Ghani] That was a criminal and cowardly act  perpetrated by the gang of apostasy and secession within the  Socialist Party leadership. This is in addition to the previous  criminal acts. They fired their missiles on residential areas.  The last missile was fired on a hospital. We can see how they  are continuing to pursue their destructive policy. While we  continue to pursue our constructive policy for rebuilding and  development. There is, of course, a difference between the two  lines -- a difference which ordinary citizens can see. Their  criminal acts will not pass without punishment, and our people  know how to respond to these people.    [AL-HAYAH] What will be the punishment?    ['Abd-al-Ghani] The punishment that every criminal who kills  innocent people deserves.    [AL-HAYAH] Does that mean you will continue your military  pressure on the other side?    ['Abd-al-Ghani] Our military actions against the leadership  of the rebels and secessionists in the Socialist Party will not  be suspended until Yemen's unity returns solid and without these  secessionists.    [AL-HAYAH] Now that government forces have seized 'Ataq, the  axis of the central sector of southern governorates, will they  advance toward Hadhramaut?    ['Abd-al-Ghani] Military actions against these people will  not be suspended in any area until the people get rid of them.    [AL-HAYAH] Is there a political solution to this war and the  current problem?    ['Abd-al-Ghani] A political solution is on the cards when  military operations cease and the 16 leaders of the secession  gang, whose prosecution has been ordered by the prosecutor  general, give themselves up.    [AL-HAYAH] We understand that the priority now is the  military battle and the destruction of your rivals.    ['Abd-al-Ghani] The fighting was started by the secessionist  gang in the Socialist Party, and we are defending unity against  what these secessionists are doing.    [AL-HAYAH] Will the Socialist Party and some of its leaders  whom you consider moderate have a role in the future of the  political movement and power in Yemen?    ['Abd-al-Ghani] We are willing to talk with Socialist Party  members who have not participated in the secession crime.    [AL-HAYAH] It has been noted that the prosecution and arrest  warrant issued by the prosecutor general in Sanaa against 16  Socialist Party leaders does not include the names of important  Socialist Party leaders like Salim Salih Muhammad, the party's  assistant secretary general; Dr. Yasin Sa'id Nu'man, chairman of  the party's Secretariat; and Dr. 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Dali, chairman  of the party's external relations department. Does that mean  that it is possible to engage in a dialogue with these?    ['Abd-al-Ghani] We are willing to engage in a dialogue with  all the Socialist Party leaders who have not participated in the  secessionist operation.</p>

			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / Late CIA chief's antiques sold: Saleroom THE ANTIQUE collection that furnished the Californian home of the late John A. McCone, who was called in by President John F. Kennedy to head the CIA after the Bay of Pigs fiasco, fetched Dollars 1.4m (Pounds 784,000) at Sotheby's in New York at the weekend. Proceeds will go to an educational foundation. A Queen Anne scarlet japanned bureau bookcase sold for Dollars 66,000 and a German rococo mirror of around 1750 made Dollars 44,000. Reasonable reserve prices ensured that virtually everything sold. Later at Sotheby's English furniture brought in Dollars 2.5m, with 20 per cent unsold. Once again vendors were prepared to accept quite modest prices, especially for the most important lot, a pair of George III giltwood candle stands with candelabra. They dated to about 1770 and may have been made by Thomas Chippendale. They sold for Dollars 82,500, well below the estimate of Dollars 180,000-Dollars 220,000. A pair of George III giltwood pier mirrors of about 1765 also sold below forecast, for a similar sum. Phillips's sale of silver in London did exceptionally well, suggesting that demand has improved considerably since Christmas. It totalled Pounds 164,990 with only 8 per cent unsold. A pair of George III wine coolers by Paul Storr were bought by the London dealer Shrubsole for Pounds 30,800. There was also keen bidding for silver spoons. An apostle spoon made by James Birkby in 1651 was bought by Shrubsole for Pounds 1,870.</p>

			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar awaits crucial figures THE DOLLAR dropped by more than a pfennig in an uncertain market as dealers trimmed long positions and adopted a defensive stance before today's crucial US jobs data, writes Neil Buckley. Dollar optimism was dented yesterday by disappointing weekly jobless claims figures showing a rise of 9,000 to 456,000, compared with an expected slight fall. However, factory orders rose 0.5 per cent, slightly above expectations. Dealers are looking for today's March non-farm payroll figures to provide further evidence that a US economic recovery is really under way and will not falter as it did last year. They said a strong figure could propel the dollar through resistance at DM1.6625 towards DM1.67, and possibly through the Y135 barrier. Most estimates are of an increase of between 20,000 to 70,000, with the average at around 45,000, although some analysts are more cautious. Mr Steven Barrow, treasury adviser at Chemical Bank, said: 'There is certainly a lot of pessimism around and everyone is concentrating on what could go wrong with the figures.' The dollar drifted to DM1.6450 and Y133.90 at the close, having reached highs of DM1.6591 and Y134.98 in the morning. These early tests of upside resistance were fuelled by another weak performance by Japanese stocks, with the Nikkei index dropping 1.59 per cent, after a 3.95 per cent slide on Wednesday. Yesterday in New York the US unit ended at DM1.6437/44 and Y133.70/75. However, unfounded rumours that the Bundesbank might be about to raise interest rates injected a note of caution into the market, which persisted even when German rates remained unchanged. In Tokyo, the dollar had also fallen back after an early surge, closing at DM 1.6567 and Y134.77 after New York closes of DM1.6508/18 and Y134.50/60 on Wednesday. The French franc climbed to a nine-month high against the D-Mark after Mr Pierre Beregovoy, finance minister, replaced Mrs Edith Cresson as prime minister - a move warmly welcomed by the markets. Mr Beregovoy is respected for his tough monetary stance and promotion of a stable franc. The D-Mark opened at FFr3.3910 and later declined to FFr3.3870/73 in lively trading. Sterling fell towards the close, although dealers said this was mainly because it had come under pressure on the cross as the dollar lost ground against the D-Mark, rather than because of any inherent weakness. Two UK opinion polls contradicting the decisive lead given to the opposition Labour party by three polls on Wednesday had earlier lifted sterling sentiment. It ended at DM2.8451/85 after Wednesday's DM2.8493/8528 close. Against the dollar, sterling rose to Dollars 1.7300 from Dollars 1.7240, and in New York to Dollars 1.7308.</p>

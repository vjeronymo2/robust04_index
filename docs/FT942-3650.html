			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / European Elections: Reform of MPs' hours is backed A radical overhaul of Westminster's antiquated working practices moved a step closer yesterday after Mr John Major said he wanted to agree a blueprint for reform before MPs depart next month for their summer holidays. The prime minister used a post-European election press conference to try to inject new momentum into the push for shorter hours and more efficient use of parliamentary time. He said the government was keen to make progress on changes that would enable parliament to do its business 'in more sensible ways, in more sensible hours'. He continued: 'If the opposition are equally keen, I hope we should be able to map the way forward before the summer recess.' Yesterday's remarks come more than two years after an all-party committee of MPs tabled a series of proposals designed to bring more rationality and commonsense to Westminster arrangements. The proposals - enshrined in the Jopling report - called for one morning sitting a week, some Fridays off and the automatic timetabling of legislation. Efforts to secure cross-party agreement to a package of changes based on the report's recommendations have been hit by a number of setbacks, however. The most recent was Labour's decision late last year to break off all relations with the government in protest at ministers' decision to curtail debate on bills implementing changes to statutory sick pay and National Insurance contributions. Since this protest ended Mr Tony Newton, leader of the Commons, is understood to have had one meeting to discuss the way ahead with Mr Nick Brown, a Labour frontbench spokesman. Another meeting is planned soon. In his comments yesterday Mr Major spoke of 'a great deal of concern' around the country about the way parliament did its business. 'I share that concern expressed to me,' he said. Commending the 'excellent' Jopling report, the prime minister said he hoped more sensible ways could be found of enabling the Commons to do its business. This would be without 'either unacceptably reducing the government's capacity to carry its programme or reducing the opposition's flexibility in deploying and pressing its case against government legislation'. He continued: 'I believe that this effort has very strong support on both sides of the House and very strong support outside the House from millions who follow our procedures.</p>

			<p><P> October 22, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> RESTAURANT REVIEW: AT LORETTA'S, THEY'RE SERIOUS ABOUT CHINESE FOOD -- AND  DESSERTS  </P> <P> What do you say about a Chinese restaurant named Loretta's?  </P> <P> That wasn't the real question. Here's the real question: What do you say about  a Chinese restaurant -- whatever its name may be -- that makes good desserts?  </P> <P> Maybe the answer is mazel tov, bienvenidos and so on, unless you're someone who  spends dinner positively looking forward to an almond cookie. Loretta's does  bring out almond cookies at the end of the meal, fortune cookies,  (unfortunately, with exceptionally vague and boring fortunes) and orange  slices. But that isn't necessarily the end of the meal.  </P> <P> Not at all. You can order real American desserts: a powerful bitter-chocolate  cake, a rich lemon cake or even chocolate mousse. There are also semi-Oriental  ice creams such as candied ginger or mango. The green tea entry stands out from  most other green tea ice creams in town because it really tastes of tea.  </P> <P> Maybe, come to think of it, there's something in the name after all, something  in the lack of reference to emperors, dragons or palaces. Maybe the same thing  that has emboldened a Chinese restaurant to get serious about dessert is even  behind the strict avoidance of MSG.  </P> <P> Loretta's recently moved from a nearby site onto a fairly high-powered block of  La Cienega that seems to be rejustifying the street's name as Restaurant Row.  Two doors down is Bice Pomodoro, and across the street are King Dragon and Ed  Debevic's. The room -- small by the standards of its famous neighbors -- is in  the classic early-'60s steakhouse style with flagstone in the walls (now  painted over). The chef is S.K. Ng, formerly of Chinese Friends, in Chinatown.  </P> <P> The food is Szechwan and Peking: in other words, the dishes Americans have  favored in Chinese restaurants for the last 20 years or so. You can get mu shu  anything, kung pao anything, anything with snow peas or black bean sauce or  green pepper. Loretta's seems to do a good job on these familiar dishes. In  particular, the ones involving spicy tomato sauce are very good, essentially  because the kitchen makes fresh tomato sauce rather than just doctoring the  ketchup.  </P> <P> For instance, the house special shrimp: crisp fried shrimp in a spicy  sweet-and-sour sauce with hot pepper oil added (it has a spicy smell  reminiscent of cloves.) Braised lobster in tomato-based garlic hot sauce is  much the same thing with a more expensive crustacean, and you can get  sweet-and-sour fish of the day in the same sort of sauce.  </P> <P> There are plenty of starred hot dishes on the menu, such as orange peel spicy  beef, with a snappy, full-bodied hot sauce on the chunks of fried beef. There's  another dish simply called spicy beef, and if it is ordered extra spicy, you  can scarcely see the bell peppers and bamboo shoots for blackened pepper pods.  </P> <P> The house specialties seem good, if not unusual. The minced chicken mixed with  mushrooms and water chestnuts, served with hoisin sauce, which you roll up in  lettuce taco-fashion, is everything it should be, and the crispy chicken is  definitely crisp. There are two good dishes of fried eggplant with shredded  chicken, one in hot sauce and the other (chiang pao eggplant) in rich brown  sauce.  </P> <P> Among the appetizers you find spicy pickled cabbage, a sort of mildly pickled  cabbage salad, sweetened and made a tiny bit hot -- there's one little pepper  pod resting on top of it. The combination appetizer platter includes nicely  cooked vegetarian egg rolls with cabbage filling, spare ribs with the usual  steamed taste and a good sweet-and-sour sauce, chicken satays, the usual fried  wontons and the traditionally puffy fried shrimp.  </P> <P> The list of soups is slightly longer than usual, 10 altogether, including a  spinach soup that is steaming chicken broth with practically raw spinach  floating in it. Egg drop soup, which I think of as a way of consuming  cornstarch, is rather more eggy than usual at Loretta's.  </P> <P> Monday through Friday special lunches are available, unfortunately  concentrating on what are some of the duller dishes. The double-cooked pork --  briefly tossed with cabbage and bell pepper in a brown sauce with red pepper  and ginger in it -- is the sort of perfunctory dish I actually stay away from  Chinese restaurants to avoid.  </P> <P> On the other hand, there's always dessert. I could almost imagine coming to  Loretta's just for that chocolate cake.  </P> <P> Suggested dishes: spiced cabbage, $6.50; house special shrimp, $10.95; braised  lobster, $19.95; chocolate cake, $3.25.  </P> <P> Loretta's Szechwan and Peking Cuisine, 163 N.

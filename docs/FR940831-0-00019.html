HC&hyph;(&blank;)3Y(&blank;)&hyph;(&blank;) series three-bladed propellers, that currently requires initial and repetitive visual and eddy current inspections for cracks in the area of the grease fitting holes on the side of the propeller hub arm. This amendment reduces the repetitive inspection interval from 25 hours time in service (TIS) to 10 hours TIS. In addition, this amendment adds an optional interim alternative method of compliance involving a chamfering modification to extend the initial and repetitive inspection compliance interval. This amendment also adds a terminating action to require propeller hub replacement to a new hub configuration where grease fittings are located in a reinforced area near the hub parting line. This amendment is prompted by a report from the Aviation Accident Investigation Board (AAIB) of the United Kingdom and a recent incident that indicates a hub failure could have occurred in less time than the 25 hour TIS inspection interval. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent possible propeller hub failure and subsequent propeller blade separation and loss of the aircraft. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Effective September 15, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of September 15, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments for inclusion in the Rules Docket must be received on or before October 31, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), New England Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;ANE&hyph;19, 12 New England Executive Park, Burlington, MA 01803&hyph;5299.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from Hartzell Propeller Inc., One Propeller Place, Piqua, OH 45356&hyph;2834; telephone (513) 778&hyph;4200, fax (513) 778&hyph;4391.

That action was prompted by reports of propeller hub failures caused by cracks initiating in the grease fitting holes on the side of the hub arm. These cracks typically originate in the threads of the hub grease fitting, then propagate around the blade arm of the hub, resulting in failure of the hub. That condition, if not corrected, could result in possible propeller hub failure and subsequent propeller blade separation and loss of the aircraft.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Since the issuance of that AD, the FAA received a report from the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) of the United Kingdom of a propeller hub failure on a propeller that had been visually inspected in accordance with AD 89&hyph;22&hyph;05. The CAA's investigation revealed that the propeller hub crack had corrosion on the fracture surface that was present for a considerable time but the crack was undetectable by visual inspection. The FAA, in conjunction with the CAA and the manufacturer, determined that the visual inspection procedure alone is inadequate to reliably find cracks in the propeller hub. On August 18, 1993, the FAA issued priority letter AD 93&hyph;16&hyph;14, which requires initial and repetitive visual inspections and eddy current inspections (ECI) for cracks in the area of the grease fitting holes on the side of the propeller hub. The FAA issued the final rule on this action on November 22, 1993, which was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on December 21, 1993 (58 FR 67307).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Recently, an inspector found an additional significant hub crack evidenced by grease leaking from the propeller hub. The hub was eddy current inspected and verified that a crack of significant length was present. The hub had been previously inspected using the eddy current inspection process with no crack indications present. A significant crack indication occurred in less time than the current 25 hour TIS inspection interval. Based on this latest service difficulty report, the FAA has determined that it is necessary to reduce the current 25 hour TIS inspection interval to 10 hours TIS for hubs installed on certain aircraft and to mandate replacement of existing designed hubs to the new hub configuration as soon as practical on these aircraft. A total of 24 hub cracks have been found to date. At the present time, over 2,500 propeller hubs have been distributed with the new post-1983 configuration propeller hub.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

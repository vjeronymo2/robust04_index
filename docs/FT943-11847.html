			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / Economic Viewpoint: No going back to Bretton Woods The Bretton Woods system, which was established 50 years ago this summer, and which broke down after President Nixon floated the dollar in the early 1970s, has often been described as a fixed exchange rate system. The description is a caricature of the intentions of the founding fathers. The latter were, above all, determined to avert the disruptive forces which destroyed an open world economy between the wars. On the monetary side they saw these as being competitive devaluations and countries being forced to adopt excessively deflationary domestic policies by the need to defend fixed exchange rates. For this reason they devised a system of 'par values' which were meant to be fixed but adjustable. The following devices were meant to guard against both competitive devaluations and deflationary pressures: An ample supply of credit for countries in balance of payments difficulties. The ability, and indeed the requirement, to adjust parities in the face of a fundamental disequilibrium. Equal obligation on surplus countries to adjust. A 'scarce currency' clause allowed members to discriminate against a surplus country which refused to conform. (Often forgotten) Capital controls were accepted as an integral part of the system. Member countries had to keep their currencies within a narrow range against the dollar. But the US itself was obliged to convert dollars into gold at the unrealistic prewar price of Dollars 35 per ounce to legitimate monetary authorities. All these elements broke down. IMF credit was not as large as Keynes intended, and his hoped-for international unit, 'bancor', was never established. But for most of the postwar decades the problem proved to be inflation rather than deflation; and the much-discussed shortage of international liquidity (which meant roughly official reserves plus borrowing ability) proved a myth. Capital controls leaked well before free market fashions led to their abolition. 'Fixed but adjustable' exchange rates proved a chimera, because, if any government professed other than an undying attachment to its parity, its currency was overwhelmed by speculative flows. With the freeing of capital movements, the current account was no longer the only influence on a currency's international value. In its last few years, Bretton Woods became frozen into a system of 'reluctant adjustment'. Countries held their parities against the US dollar as long as possible, a leading example being Harold Wilson's stubborn defence of the sterling parity between 1964 and 1967. The end of Bretton Woods was triggered by the inflationary financing of the Vietnam war, which made countries increasingly reluctant to hold their reserves in dollars. Since then the main international currencies have been floating against each other. How well has floating worked? Enthusiasts on both sides have been discomfited. We forget how many establishment figures solemnly told us that floating rates could not work. On the other hand all those economic theorists who expected easy and gradual adjustments have proved equally mistaken. Nor have countries gained freedom to run domestic monetary policies exactly as they liked. Governments have indeed had the option of running inflationary monetary policies and sinking exchange rates; but holders of their currencies have eventually demanded an interest rate premium for doing so. Countries have been able to have lower real interest rates than their trading partners only in temporary and exceptional circumstances. The material assembled by the independent Bretton Woods commission, chaired by Paul Volcker, has shown floating to have been anything but a smooth ride. The volatility of the D-Mark-dollar exchange rate, judged by the monthly percentage change, has quite often been near 10 per cent and has rarely been very low. Business can probably learn to live with short-term volatility. More worrying have been the medium-term swings shown in the chart on this page. In the mid-1980s there was a sharp boom in the dollar which took its value to 50 per cent above anything that could be justified by inflation differentials. The yen has since not only drifted upwards but shown large medium-term swings and is now even more ridiculously overvalued than the dollar was in 1985. Have these fluctuations held back real activity? The Bretton Woods Commission has yet another chart showing how average growth rates in the Group of Seven main industrial countries declined from nearly 5 per cent a year before 1973 to 2 1/2 per cent in the following decades. It also shows a jump in fiscal deficits and a decline in total savings and investment. But it would be a brave soul who could confidently attribute these changes to floating exchange rates. The first decade and a half of floating was also associated with near double-digit inflation in the main industrial countries. In the past few years, however, inflation has subsided to the levels of the early 1960s. What has become clear, however, is that convergence on low inflation rates is insufficient to produce stable exchange rates. The biggest intellectual change since the old battles between fixed and floating rates has been a loss of belief in the ability of inflationary policies to stimulate an economy. Depreciation, if long continued, is only a way of accommodating higher inflation than partner countries and is ultimately self-defeating. There has also been a loosening of the perceived link between exchange rates and current balance of payments surpluses or deficits. If they are a problem - which they may not be - these imbalances reflect gaps between domestic savings and investment which can be tackled, if at all, only through fiscal policy. Why not then abandon the attempt to seize fleeting advantages from temporary depreciation or appreciation for the benefit of predictable locked-in exchange rates or even a world currency? This, after all, happens inside the US, where in exchange for the benefits of a common dollar, states such as Texas or California have to accept a Federal Reserve monetary policy relating to average US conditions. Central bankers blame fiscal deficits both for exchange rate volatility under floating rates and for the difficulty of making an early start on a new fixed system such as European economic and monetary union (Emu). Mainstream economists also say that there are no tax and transfer mechanisms among the G7 or even the European Union on a scale corresponding to the US tax and social security system. But there was no such transfer mechanism even under the pre-1914 gold standard. Recent attempts to establish target exchange rate zones in the 1980s or narrow bands in the exchange rate mechanism (ERM) have basically failed because of the absence of a linked monetary policy. Can there be such a policy in the absence of a single government? The experience of the gold standard suggests that there can be. The proposed European central bank, if and when it gets off the ground, should be an instructive pilot project. Meanwhile, the accident of the earth having turned round the sun 50 times since Bretton Woods will not bring a systemic change any nearer. For the time being the comment of Ernest Stern, managing director of the World Bank, about what is likely to follow the 50th anniversary of Bretton Woods is the wisest available guide. He simply said: 'Well, the 51st anniversary.'</p>

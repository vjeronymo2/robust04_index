			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / International Company News: YSL recovers from first-half fall YVES Saint Laurent, one of the most famous French fashion houses, recovered from its first-half profits fall to produce virtually static 1991 full-year net profits of FFr233m (Dollars 41.60m). YSL suffered with the rest of the global luxury goods industry during the Gulf war, in early 1991, because of its affect on the important duty free market. It subsequently sustained a sharp fall, of 42 per cent, in profits during the first half of the year. However, the group, which recently celebrated the 30th anniversary of its haute couture house, recovered in the second half, despite the impact of economic slowdown in the US and Japan on consumer demand for luxury goods. It reported a marginal increase in sales, from FFr3bn in 1990 to FFr3.06bn in 1991; net profits were down from FFr252m to FFr233m. The couture division, which includes pret a porter, as well as the exclusive haute couture collection, increased operating profits, from FFr123m to FFr132m, on sales down from FFr521m to FFr512m. Perfumes and cosmetics, the biggest part of the business, saw profits fall from FFr392m to FFr377m, on sales which rose from FFr2.43bn to FFr2.5bn.</p>

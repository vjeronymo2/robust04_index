Its Reconstruction and Development Programme promises to redress the legacy of apartheid.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- National Party Leader: FW de Klerk  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Orginally exlusively Afrikaner, now includes much coloured, Indian and some black support. Party founded in 1914 and came to power in 1948 advocating racial separation. Concept of apartheid and black homelands refined in 1960s. 'New' party has apologised for its past. Asserts Christian and familiy values, national reconciliation and strong economic growth.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Inkatha Freedom Party Leader: Mangosuthu Buthelezi  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Formed in 1975 as a Zulu cultural organisation, with the blessing of ANC, but the two groups fell out in late 1970s, partly due to Buthelezi's opposition to sanctions and the ANC military campaign. Thousands have died in clashes between rival supporters since 1984. Stands for greater power to Natal, home to most of country's 9m Zulus.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Freedom Front Leader: Constand Viljeon  --------------------------------------------------------------------- A group of retired army officers last year formed the Afrikaner Volksfront (People's Front) to unify the Afrikaner right and resist transition. Last month, Gen Viljoen, the movement's leader, broke away to form a new group, the Freedom Front (VF/FF), to contest the elections, using them as a referendum to test support for an Afrikaner volkstaat (homeland).  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Communist Party Leader: Joe Slovo  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Allied with the ANC, the party's members fill many top spots on the ANC election list. Chairman Slovo has tried hard to lay to rest the 'communist bogey' and emphasises the party has no 'hidden agenda'. But many South Africans remain hostile to the party, and many Christian voters reject the ANC because of its communist connections.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Democratic Party Leader: Zach de Beer  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Founded 1989, its historical roots are in the now defunct Progressive Federal Party, in turn formed in 1959 by a group of liberal white members of parliament, including Helen Suzman. Strong civil rights platform. Advocates clean government, deregulation and law and order.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Pan Africanist Congress Leader: Clarence Makwetu  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Founded in 1959 when an 'Africanist' faction left ANC and now advocates radical economic reform, stressing redistribution of land. Support in Cape and PWV regions and township youth. Armed wing, the Azanian People's Liberation Army (APLA), attacked white targets in 1993 but announced moratorium this year.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- THE BOYCOTTERS  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Conservative Party Leader: Ferdie Hartzenberg  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Founded 1982 to seek to enforce apartheid, now wants a volkstaat. The KP/CP won 31 per cent of vote in the last all-white election in 1989 and advocated a No vote in 1993 referendum, in which 35.5 per cent opposed reform. But subsequent splits in the country's right wing make the party's strength hard to assess.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

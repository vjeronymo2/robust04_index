			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / Arts: Shaken and stirred by serial music - David Murray applauds the 'Alternative Vienna' mini-festival on the South Bank ON THURSDAY the South Bank began one of its timeliest and best-planned mini-festivals, under the label 'Alternative Vienna'. That is a fairly sexy label: it suggests something subversive of Vienna's notorious conservatism about music - something brash and populist, and perhaps a bit tacky, as many cultivated Berliners found Kurt Weill's theatre-music in the 1930s. There is some kinship. Yet an alternative label might have captured better why Kurt Schwertsik (born 1935) and HK Gruber (just turned 50) should have a mini-festival built around their music: 'The Viennese Alternative'. Far beyond Austria, many, many composers who were shaken and/or stirred by the potent ideals of serialism, in the 1950s and after, have ever since been seeking an Alternative like a Holy Grail. On the one hand, serialism proposed a compositional means that could be both 'rigorous' and bracingly open-ended, with exciting room for development. On the other its lofty disdain for tonality - an omnipresent power no less in popular music (meaning the music we all grow up with) than in 'classical' - challenged new listeners with the test of learning the rules of an unfamiliar game. Only a few of them bothered to do that. Predictions that modern audiences would slip naturally into the right listening-mode proved over-optimistic by a very long way: between the general audience and an educated sub-set, a chasm has yawned. It was a continuing embarrassment that the works of Alban Berg - only sometimes properly 'serial' and fraught with compromising tonal echoes - remained the sole public triumph of the New Music. Composers nowadays, like their colleagues in other arts, are acutely self-conscious about theory; there have been no good theories to accommodate both serialism, with its guiding premise about the 'democracy' of all 12 notes of the chromatic scale, and the bald fact that our ears hunt out tonally biased roots. Yet there is an escape-route: which is to remember that every creditable theory about music - about any art] - follows practice, and does not precede it. The first thing to be said about the music of Schwertsik and Gruber is that it is directly engaging, sometimes hugely engaging, without trading upon familiar routines (except to contradict them). Continual surprises are essential to its charm, not least because in retrospect they seem to make perfect sense. These composers deploy elements of well-worn styles in unexpected orders, and a strictly up-to-date sensibility shines through. They are close colleagues, but not twins. At the start of the 1960s, when Gruber had just retired from the Vienna Boys' Choir and taken up the double-bass, Schwertsik was a committed disciple of the Darmstadt school. With Friedrich Cerha he had already founded the ensemble die reihe ('the row', ie the Schoenbergian 12-note row, and by extension any new serialist methods) - a senior Continental equivalent of the London Sinfonietta. But doubts about communicability were setting in; Schwertsik was attracted by John Cage's musical anarchism, and he also became a friend of the young Cornelius Cardew, then a frustrated under-labourer on Stockhausen's arcanely elaborate scores. While Cardew turned to writing for transparent popular appeal with a frank political message, Schwertsik published a manifesto inveighing against narrow serialist dogma. He had already produced the 'Violin Concerto' we heard on Thursday, really a five-piece suite of exquisitely dry, contrasted manners, all deeply quirky - weird little ensembles for accompaniments (but peculiarly telling), abrupt silences at unexpected places, the solo role bundled briskly from foreground to background and back again; but always, a limpid lyrical line. The young Russian Sergej Stadler delivered it with all the right lusty innocence; Franz Welser-Most drew beautifully wry support from his London Philharmonic. It was appalling to hear them return after the interval to play Mahler's Symphony no. 9 so badly - ill-tuned, raw and rough - and to watch Welser-Most's extravagant windmilling achieve only a first movement that sounded like a kit of unassembled parts, middle movements of shrill crudity, and a heedlessly loud, vulgar finale. There must be more to the story; perhaps there had been some kind of cataclysm in the Green Room. While Gruber played double-bass in die reihe, his music never travelled far. By the start of the 1980s, however, his 'pan-demonium' Frankenstein]] - a monster cabaret on gallows-humour verses, for himself as rampant chansonnier and a brittly twinkling orchestra (due here on April 27) - began to make the rounds of all the musical capitals. A first Violin Concerto soon confirmed that there was a unique Gruber idiom, besides a delectable sweet-and-sour sound (he loves vibes, marimbas, xylorimbas and glockenspiels), and that it was rich enough to nourish a substantial work. His virtuoso Cello Concerto (April 24), commissioned by Yo Yo Ma, is a miracle of evasive wit and charm, a lovely gift to the repertoire. Londoners are still waiting to hear his intense, spidery, intimate Violin Concerto no. 2. What makes the Schwertsik-Gruber front a significant Viennese Alternative, and not just Alternative Viennese, is that they have found a musical diction that answers to ideals widely entertained, but scarcely realised anywhere else. To be open and appealing to non-theoretical ears; to rise to succinct, complex expression nevertheless, escaping the constraints of popular Minimalism (a second-rate Alternative); to eschew stock routines and cosy pastiche, whilst acknowledging roots in the old musical basis - a lot of composers wish they could manage that] If you care about where 'modern' music might be going, you should go and hear some of this stuff. At the very least, which is already a lot, it will be fun. Further 'Alternative Vienna' concerts tonight, April 17, 24, 26, 27, 28, 30 and May 6; details from South Bank Centre box-office</p>

			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / EBRD business rises four-fold The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development last year registered about a four-fold increase in disbursements of loans and equity investments to eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. Its disbursements increased to Ecu435m (Pounds 329m) last year from Ecu122m in 1992, with signed loan and equity commitments rising to Ecu1.79bn during 1993 from Ecu946m during 1992. The bank also registered a small net profit of Ecu4m in 1993, after a loss of Ecu6m in 1992. The bank was heavily criticised last year for over-spending in administrative and refurbishment outlays. This provoked a crisis which led to the resignation of Mr Jacques Attali and his replacement by Mr Jacques de Larosiere. The bank said it had taken action to lower operating costs to Ecu137m, 8 per cent below budgeted levels.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Yi Tong-min] </F>   [Text] Jakarta, May 23 (YONHAP) -- The diplomatic  importance of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) to South Korea was  driven home during Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu's visit here  this week, especially with the North Korean nuclear controvery  looming in the background.    Han came to Jakarta eight days before a meeting of NAM  foreign ministers, held every three years, in Cairo where the  North Korean nuclear issue, in connection with an overall review  of the situation on the Korean peninsula, will be addressed for  the first time.    "It's important that we make clear where we stand on the  North Korean nuclear problem, that NAM take our position into  account when the foreign ministers' meeting convenes," said Yu  Pyong-u, director-general of the Asian Affairs Bureau at the  South Korean Foreign Ministry.    The foreign ministers are expected to adopt a final document  through consensus and the wording of the clause on the nuclear  impasse, if it in any way leans toward South Korea, will have no  small impact considering Pyongyang's ties with NAM.    North Korea keeps its third largest embassy in Jakarta with  a  25-member staff. Current Ambassador Ham Pong-ha has been here  for four years. Diplomatic officials say the embassy functions  as a base camp for North Korea's diplomatic lobbying activities  in Southeast Asia as well as Australia and New Zealand.    Indonesia, as the chair of NAM, could serve as South Korea's  window to the group by reflecting its position without Seoul  actually being there, bringing the movement more toward the  center between the two Koreas.    It is hoped that Han's visit will add force to Seoul's  efforts to achieve this objective.    Indonesia's stance on the nuclear issue was too ambivalent  from Seoul's point of view as late as last January, when Jakarta  kept visibly silent as the UN Security Council adopted a  resolution urging Pyongyang to comply with International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections.    South Korea felt compelled to step up its persuasion of  Indonesia, hoping in turn to reach NAM.    Then in March, President Suharto sent one of his ambassadors  to North Korea as a special envoy. The following month, North  Korea sent Vice Foreign Minister Kim Chang-kyu to Jakarta.    This activity produced a letter from President Suharto,  speaking as NAM chairman, to UN Secretary-General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali saying the group wanted to see the problem solved  through dialogue, but that North Korea should accept IAEA  inspections and remain within the nuclear Nonproliferation  Treaty (NPT) regime.    Seoul officials say this stance was the product of much  convincing by South Korea and international organizations. The  global consensus obviously helped as the issue has been recycled  through IAEA, United Nations and Security Council statements and  resolutions, they say.    South Korea's ties with NAM will receive a more potent boost  when President Kim Yong-sam comes here for the Asia-Pacific  Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in November. The Seoul  government expects a Kim-Suharto summit during the APEC  conference.    The presidents will likely go over again, at the highest  level, where they stand on the nuclear controversy while  strengthening their two-way relationship.</p>

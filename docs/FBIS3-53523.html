Our sources affirmed  that the resistance ambushes opened fire when the tyrant's  security forces passed the above-mentioned road. They said that  a fierce battle ensued between the resistance groups and the  regime's security forces. A number of soldiers and officers  from the tyrant's security forces were killed and the rest  withdrew, dragging their tails behind them. The Islamic  resistance forces returned to their bases safely.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Special report" by the Radio ACIR Network News Department] </F>   [Text] [Station announcer] Since early this morning at the  headquarters of the Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI],  there has been considerable activity among members of the  National Executive Committee. At noon, Fernando Ortiz Arana,  president of the National Executive Committee of the PRI,  arrived at PRI headquarters after spending most of the morning  at the Los Pinos Presidential Residence.    Again, I want to stress that there is a great deal of  activity at PRI headquarters. Let us go now to PRI  headquarters, where we have Rosie Ahuactzin Vasquez standing by.  Rosie, good afternoon.    [Ahuactzin] Thank you, and good afternoon to you. Given the  anxiety here at PRI headquarters, Fernando Ortiz Arana,  president of the PRI National Executive Committee, has issued a  news release. This news release says: The PRI continues to  remain loyal to the democratic and libertarian ideology endorsed  by the party, as well as to remain loyal to President Carlos  Salinas de Gortari, who serves as the guardian of the nation's  faith, justice, and the de jure state.    Fernando Ortiz Arana said the PRI National Executive  Committee has disavowed -- and this should be stressed -- any  expression of support in favor of any candidate until the PRI  establishes the internal procedures for conducting this  unprecedented process.    For the PRI, as well as for all of Mexico, the president of  the PRI National Executive Committee added that these days are a  time of mourning and reflection, and, therefore, in due time an  internal process based on the party's bylaws will be initiated  to select the new candidate.    Ortiz Arana also stressed that the party remains united  behind the ideological and political program proposed by Luis  Donaldo Colosio, because his colors were the same as those of  the PRI. Fernando Ortiz Arana reiterated that on behalf of the  PRI National Executive Committee, no member or official of the  party is authorized to make statements on the election of  possible presidential candidates. He expressed this process  must conform to existing bylaws.    This is what the news release issued by the PRI said. In  short, it indicates that we will have to wait a little longer  before a new presidential candidate is selected. I must repeat,  however, there is a great deal of activity within the PRI  offices. There are even three mobile television units here.  There are also a large number of foreign reporters and, of  course, domestic journalists.    [Station announcer] Could you please repeat the basic points  of this news release just issued by Fernando Ortiz Arana,  president of the PRI National Executive Committee, warning PRI  forces and leaders not to publicly endorse any individual? The  news release also said the PRI National Executive Committee, in  keeping with the party's statutes, will in due time report the  name of the candidate who will replace Luis Donaldo Colosio on  the PRI ticket, correct?    [Ahuactzin] Fernando Ortiz Arana's news release says we are  in a time of mourning; at least nine days of mourning will be  observed. He said the party disavows any expression of support  in favor of any individual until the PRI, in accordance with its  bylaws, establishes the procedure for conducting this internal  process, which is unprecedented. He also spoke of the need to  maintain loyalty toward the democratic and libertarian ideology  of the party, as well as to remain loyal to President Carlos  Salinas de Gortari.    Not long ago here in the press room, a news conference was  held by the so-called Democracy 2000 group, which reiterated its  support for Luis Donaldo Colosio to be replaced by Fernando  Ortiz Arana. The news release indicates Fernando Ortiz Arana is  very upset with this news conference by Democracy 2000. He said  this group's position has been renounced, adding that no  endorsement should be made until the members of the Political  Council meet to determine the process for selecting the new  candidate.    In addition, Mario Moya Palencia, who was appointed  secretary  of the PRI Ideology Commission by Luis Donaldo Colosio, has  stated that the party is in no hurry to select a new  presidential candidate. He explained that everything must be  done in accordance with the party's statutes and within the  framework of the law in an effort to avoid divisions within the  party.</p>

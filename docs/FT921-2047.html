			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Leading Article: Politics and unemployment THE IDEA that unemployment does not affect the outcome of UK general elections is now being put to severe test. Mrs Thatcher had the good sense, or good fortune, to seek re-election when the economy was growing and unemployment was rising slowly or falling. Not so Mr Major. Against a background of falling output and accelerating unemployment, he must persuade nervous southern householders that things would be worse under Labour. The polls suggest voters are not convinced. Yesterday's figures will do little to ease their fears. Unemployment has accelerated upwards in recent months and is rising fastest in the south and west Midlands, where many finely balanced Tory marginals are concentrated. And the figures will probably be rising for another year or more. The case against the government is that its errors caused the recession. The case for change is that unemployment will peak earlier and fall faster if Labour is elected. It is a case that Labour has yet to make convincingly. The exchange rate mechanism will constrain the ambitions of whichever party is elected, assuming their resistance to devaluation is sustained. The recovery, when it finally comes, will remain sluggish until German interest rates start to fall and maybe longer. Fiscal stance Nor does fiscal policy materially differentiate the two parties. Both budgets implied the same overall fiscal stance, although Labour would channel more money into temporary investment incentives and infrastructure spending than into tax cuts. Labour's package would probably be slightly more expansionary. Independent calculations from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research suggest growth under Labour would be 3 per cent in 1993 compared to 2.7 per cent under the Conservatives. Yet the difference between them is dwarfed by the normal margin of error in forecasts. It is the two parties supply-side policies that will most affect the long-term difference in the rates of economic growth they can deliver. In the field of support for the unemployed and wage-bargaining, the government offers more of the same while Labour offers modest change. Yet not all of Labour's reforms are desirable. The NIESR expects unemployment to be 300,000 lower under Labour in 1993, largely because of the more extensive package of support for the unemployed promised in its manifesto. Commendably, Labour promises to restore last year's cuts in spending on training for the unemployed in order to guarantee job experience or training, as well as just counselling, for everyone unemployed for over six months. But it also plans a statutory minimum wage which would cost upwards of 100,000 jobs - ostensibly to end 'poverty pay', but in reality to appease the public sector unions. Archaic system Labour has also shuffled towards bringing some order to the archaic UK system of wage bargaining. Yesterday brought the dismal news that UK average earnings have fallen by less than one percentage point since last June, since when unemployment has risen by 350,000. At this rate, many more jobs will have to go before the UK finally gets its rate of wage inflation down to a sustainable level within the ERM. Labour's national economic assessment might, at least, focus the minds of British businesses and trade unions on the need to cut wage inflation to below 5 per cent. The risk is that it, as with many of Labour's proposals, could become a tool for government intervention to protect interest groups when the going gets tough. Labour now talks the language of the market and stresses the need to boost Britain's miserable labour productivity. It also recognises that government has a role in providing better incentives for training, guidance on wage expectations and direct measures to cut long-term unemployment. The risk is that Labour would more than undo all of these good things by impeding competition and pricing the unskilled out of work.</p>

			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / World Commodities Prices: Wool Strength in demand for wool and gradually rising prices in recent weeks are leading to more confidence. Clearances in Australia were again very good at this week's auctions, and price increases were particularly marked among superfine merinos at Goulburn. This sector has been leading the market upwards for some time and stockpile availability is limited. There is a widening view that the lowest point might have been passed in wool's long and painful recession, and that stockpile disposal fears may have been overdone. The AWC market indicator was 455 cents a kg on October 13, from 442 cents a week before.</p>

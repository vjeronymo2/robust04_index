			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / International Company News: Dunnes battle comes to court - Former chairman seeks break-up of controlling family trust A two year battle for control of Dunnes Stores, Ireland's largest retailer, moves to the High Court today when Mr Ben Dunne, the former chairman, will ask the court to break-up the family trust that has owned most of the company since the 1960s. Mr Dunne lost the chairmanship of Dunne Holdings, the group company, in March last year after being out voted 3-2 by the other executive directors, who are also his brother and sisters. By August last year, he had been relieved of all executive responsibilities. Dunnes has an annual turnover of IPounds 900m (Pounds 880m), employs 5,000 people and has about 22 per cent of the Irish retail market. Following an unsuccessful attempt in August 1993 to get the other members of the family to buy him out, Mr Dunne instigated legal action. He is seeking to have the trust declared invalid, claiming it does not operate as a genuine discretionary trust and was designed to shield the assets of the business from the Irish revenue authorities. Set up in the 1960s by the company's founder, Mr Ben Dunne Snr, the trust holds 99,000 non-voting ordinary shares. There are 1,000 voting preference shares held equally by Mr Dunne, his brother and two sisters, as well as the estate of one sister who died last year. The ordinary shares are held in trust for the children of the five preference shareholders. If the trust is broken up, the ordinary shares are expected to pass to the preference shareholders on a pro-rata basis. Mr Dunne is claiming that a decision by the trustees to extend the trust after it was due to expire in 1985 was not valid as they did not have the power to do so. By extending the trust, a capital gains tax bill, estimated to have been IPounds 40m, was avoided. Mr Dunne is also alleging that the trustees cannot carry out their functions properly because of an 'invidious conflict of interest' as some of them are also legal and financial advisers to the company. The four trustees are Mr Noel Fox, a senior partner in Oliver Freaney, the Dublin accountancy firm, Mr Edward Montgomery, a senior partner in Matheson Ormsby Prentice, the law firm, and Mr Frank Bowen and Mr Bernard Uniacke, two partners in the Irish practice of Deloitte &amp; Touche. If Mr Dunne is successful he will seek to buy-out his brother and sisters or sell his shares, valued at IPounds 80m, to them. In a separate action, due to start later this year or early next year, Mr Dunne will claim that he has been oppressed and ask the court to order his brother and sisters to sell their shares to him. Alternatively, he wants to be returned to his previous position or have the court make his brother and sisters buy him out. Failing that, he wants the company wound-up and the assets distributed.</p>

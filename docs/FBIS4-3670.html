			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["News Analysis" by Tang Shuifu: "Kim Yong-sam Strives To </F> Control Power"]    [Text] Seoul, April 23 (XINHUA) -- The dismissal of Prime  Minister Yi Hoe-chang on Friday [22 April] has demonstrated  South Korean President Kim Yong-sam's strong determination to  control the cabinet.    Yi Hoe-chang, chosen as the prime minister last December,  suddenly tendered his resignation Friday to the president who  immediately appointed Yi Yong-tok, deputy prime minister and  National Unification Board (NUB) minister, to fill the vacant.    The new appointment is subject to approval by the national  assembly which is expected to endorse it next Monday.    Yi Hoe-chang's resignation came just one day after he lashed  out the decision-making process of President Kim's  administration.    Yi Hoe-chang, who is called "Mr. Bamboo" for his  uncompromising character, reportedly became furious when he was  left in the dark about a major change in the government policy  on the nuclear issue of the Democratic People's Republic of  Korea (DPRK) at a recent strategy meeting.    The meeting, named the policy coordinating conference,  opened  under instruction from the president in response to the media  and public criticism of the government's "inconsistency" in  security policies.    The meeting, which was held on April 15, decided that South  Korea would withdraw unconditionally its demand on an  inter-Korean envoy exchange as a pre-condition for the DPRK to  hold further talks with the United States at high level.    Yi Hoe-chang also complained, apparently targeting the  presidential staff, that a policy decision on the acceptance of  all the DPRK's "escapees in Pyongyang-run logging camps" in  Russia, who wish to settle in South Korea, was leaked to the  press even before it was formally adopted by the cabinet.    On the other hand, Yi himself initiated steps to control the  so- called "safe houses," which are owned by police and other  investigating authorities, without consulting the presidential  office, which was reportedly annoyed by the presidential office.    A presidential official said the president's swift  acceptance  of Yi's resignation could be seen as a "dismissal."    Kim said on several occasions that under the presidential  government system, only the president is responsible for major  state affairs.    The replacement of Yi, however, is expected to arouse strong  criticisms on what the opposition calls Kim's "one-man rule,"  political analysts here said.    The democratic party, South Korea's major opposition, said  that it regretted Yi's resignation after having been held in  checks by his rivals.    The dismissal of Yi, who had served as chairman of the board  of audit and inspection until last December, spearheaded the  non-military president's campaign to tighten his control of  political power, the analysts noted.</p>

			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Interest blitz by Revenue NON-TAXPAYERS who have registered to receive their interest gross from banks and building societies should ensure that their income does not exceed their personal allowances. The Inland Revenue expressed concern this week that a significant number of people who have registered are, in fact, taxpayers and will have to revert to receiving interest net of tax. Since the gross interest scheme was introduced in April, an estimated 15m accounts - representing about 7m people - have been registered. To be eligible, their total income must be less than their personal allowances. But recent research by the Revenue suggests that up to 1m of these people actually are taxpayers and should be receiving interest net. The Revenue is stressing that most who have registered probably have misunderstood the regulations and have not attempted to defraud its inspectors. These include: Pensioners who may have forgotten to include their retirement pensions as part of their income. People with several savings accounts who may have thought they could register to receive gross interest on one account if they had allowances to cover the interest on it. The Revenue has begun an 'audit' of people registered to receive interest gross. It will approach either them or their tax offices for information and will ask banks and building societies to start paying interest net on any accounts found to belong to taxpayers. It could also ask for tax owing. If it finds that someone has made false declarations deliberately and knowingly, it will also considering levying interest on the tax, fines of up to Pounds 3,000, and penalties up to the value of the tax not paid. Anyone who believes they have registered wrongly should notify their tax office or write to Colin Gillbanks, Inland Revenue Claims Branch, Savings &amp; Investments (BRT), St John's House, Merton Road, Bootle, Merseyside L69 9BB. Non-taxpayers registering to receive interest gross should complete form R85. Details are provided in leaflet IR 110.</p>

Among the victims of this policy  have been even the Muslim countries. Afghanistan is one of  them. Pak-supported religious fundamentalists did not allow any  government to survive in that country. The victory of these  fundamentalist forces there has brought about a never ending  nightmare for the innocent Afghan population. The Afghan  president twice protested against Pakistan's support to  fundamentalist forces led by Hekmatyar Khan. But these protests  have been replied with only economic aid.    Egypt is another country which openly accused Pakistan of  supporting those elements who wanted to destabilize the present  government there. During his visit to Washington early last  year, President Husni Mubarak had told President Clinton of the  threat his government faced from fundamentalists trained in  terrorist activities in Pakistan. The USA at that time was  supposed to be keeping Pakistan under watch. It is not known  what assurance Mr. Clinton gave to Mr. Mubarak. What we know,  that after some months Pakistan was removed from the list of  terrorism supporting countries. We also know that after the  prime minister of Egypt, 'Atif Sidqi, escaped an attempt on his  life last November made by a person who keeps on visiting  Pakistan and Afghanistan. The name of this person is Mohammad  (Makavi) who confessed to the FRONTIER POST of Peshawar last  month that he was behind the attack on Mr. Sidqi's life.  (Makavi) confessed that he has been fully involved in the war  in Afghanistan and that he is a supporter of Hekmatyar Khan and  opponent of President Borhanoddin Rabbani. His confession is  vital, inasmuch as it clearly reveals that religious  fundamentalists do not keep their activities confined to their  own countries. This is something India has started facing in  Kashmir.    Like Egypt, Algeria, too, is faced with the threat to its  stability from Pakistan-trained militants. The Algerian prime  minister, Redha Malek, recently told newsmen that  anti-government Algerians were getting training in Afghan-Arab  camps in Pakistan. They were receiving money from external  sources and that money was used for buying weapons in Western  countries to be transported to Algeria for terrorist activities.  Mr. Mubarak [name as heard] condemned both Pakistan and Sudan  for their support to these elements and pleaded with Western  countries not to allow these elements to use their soil for  anti-Algeria activities. What some Muslim countries are facing  at the hands of Pakistan today has been the experience of India.  And what is happening in Kashmir is terrorism and human rights  violation at the hands of these foreign- trained elements.</p>

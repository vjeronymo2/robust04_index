			<p><P> May 29, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOOK REVIEW;  </P> <P> AN INQUIRING MIND CHECKS OUT THE BRAIN  </P> <P> Vital Principles: The Molecular Mechanisms of Life by Andrew Scott (Basil  Blackwell: $19.95; 256 pages)  </P> <P> One of the central unanswered questions of modern biology is whether chemistry  is all there is to life. Is biology just a branch of chemistry, and is  chemistry just a branch of physics?  </P> <P> To be sure, we are nowhere near having a complete chemical explanation for all  living things, but in the end, is that what it will turn out to be?  </P> <P> Few people are altogether comfortable with that idea, but all we know strongly  implies that we are just flesh and blood. Complex chemistry, to be sure, but  chemistry nonetheless. This is called the reductionist position. Life is "just"  chemistry.  </P> <P> If you think that's wrong, you have to explain what else there is in your head  that gives rise to thoughts, feelings, sensations and such. If there is a soul,  where is it?  </P> <P> As you read these words, perhaps hearing them in your mind, the little voice  that's "speaking" them is nothing but a complex set of electrochemical changes  in your brain.  </P> <P> If you don't like that idea, come up with a better one. The field is wide open.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Search for Answers  </P> <P> Max Delbruck , who half a century ago taught biologists that they should be  interested in biochemistry, believed that there would be special laws of  physics that would be applicable to living things. He never found any.  </P> <P> Some biologists offer an alternative to reductionism without invoking spiritual  or supernatural phenomena. They believe that while chemistry can explain a lot  of life, it can't explain all of it. They suggest that there are "emergent"  principles that arise in unpredictable ways in the course of the predictable  chemistry of life.  </P> <P> This is a guess. Much remains unknown, and everyone is free to think that it  will follow rules that are known or rules that are so-far unknown. At the  moment, it's a matter of choice, a matter of faith.  </P> <P> But all of the evidence in hand argues in favor of reductionism, like it or  not. As Andrew Scott puts it in "Vital Principles," a book that makes the case  for reductionism, "All living things are simply the end result of the physics  and chemistry within them. . . . As far as we know life simply is chemistry."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Basic Principles  </P> <P> Scott works from the bottom up, first explaining the basic principles of  chemistry and physics, then showing how chemical reactions occur, then showing  how they occur in living things. He writes:  </P> <P> "DNA makes RNA, which makes protein, which makes cells, including their DNA and  RNA and protein: that is the central principle of life."  </P> <P> All of the processes of life occur "mindlessly," he says. All of the chemical  regulation, the production of proteins, reproduction, all of it is the  inevitable result of the laws of chemistry.  </P> <P> This discussion takes up the first three-fourths of the book, and, truth to  tell, it's rough going at times, despite Scott's repeated assertions that he's  leaving out the details. Feel free to skim those parts where he's put in too  many of them.  </P> <P> The really interesting part comes in the last quarter of the book, where Scott  turns to the higher brain functions in humans. Right off, he concedes that our  knowledge is sketchy at best.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Mere' Chemistry  </P> <P> To be sure, there is no evidence that there is anything at work in our brains  besides "mere" chemistry. But how chemistry gives rise to consciousness is  still a great mystery.  </P> <P> "As far as we know, our minds are created by our brains and by our brains  alone," Scott writes. "And the significant thing that happens in our brains is  the transmission of nerve impulses. . . . All this 'nervous activity' is  created and controlled by the activities of proteins and their specific  interactions with the other chemicals of life; and, of course, the proteins are  encoded by the genetic information in our genes.  </P> <P> "In essence, that is all that our enquiring minds have been able to discover  about these minds, and it may be all there is to discover."  </P> <P> If you share the central dogma of biology -- as I do -- you have faith that  someday, probably not in our lifetimes, science will have a complete  explanation of the chemistry of the brain. We will then be able to match every  thought, every shading and nuance of emotion, every memory, with a specific  chemical state. For the moment, however -- and the moment may last a very long  time -- that is an article of faith.  </P> <P> "Sadly," Scott says, "the deepest mysteries concern the questions we would most  like to be able to answer.  </P> <P> "We are all living minds, and yet science cannot tell us exactly what a mind  is, or what a thought, an idea or a sensation in our brain is. It can offer no  really satisfactory answer to the puzzle of how inanimate matter composed of  atoms and molecules and ions can give rise to the consciousness which is able  to identify and confront such puzzles."  </P></p>

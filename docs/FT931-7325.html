			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Consortium at Lloyd's formed CASSIDY DAVIS, the Lloyd's managing agency, has formed an underwriting 'consortium' with two of France's largest insurance companies, allowing it to underwrite an extra Pounds 12m of business. The agreement, the first by any Lloyd's syndicate since rules governing such arrangements were eased last year, allows the underwriter of Cassidy Davis syndicate 582 to accept the extra business on behalf of Assurance Generales de France and SCOR. Two brokers, Hayward Till and Jardine Thompson Graham, are also involved in the deal, which is geared to increasing sales of creditor insurance - accident, sickness and unemployment cover for loans. Consortia between syndicates and insurance companies are one of the main ways that extra capital can be brought to the Lloyd's market, where insurance capacity has shrunk following recent heavy losses. Capital is expected to fall to less than Pounds 8.5bn in 1993, compared with Pounds 10.1bn in 1992, owing to the fall in the number of Names - individuals whose capital supports Lloyd's. 'It gives us the capacity we need in an expanding market,' said Mr Tony Cassidy, chairman of Cassidy Davis.</p>

Mr. Matinchev familiarized Mr. Ruehe with the political  priorities of the Bulgarian Government, the difficulties in  implementing the economic reform and Bulgaria's losses ensuing  from the Yugo-embargo. Mr. Matinchev emphasized that Bulgaria  attaches paramount importance to Germany's support in settling  its external debt problem by signing arrangements with the Paris  and the London clubs, the Government Press Office said. Mr.  Ruehe said that following the processes in Bulgaria, the German  Government sees some positive signs. In answer to the Bulgarian  Government's request that Germany ratify Bulgaria's Europe  Agreement before the summer recess of the Bundestag, Mr. Ruehe  said that the agreement had already been endorsed by the  Committee on Foreign Policy and was now being considered by the  Economic Committee. According to Mr. Ruehe, the German  Government will do its best to help Bulgaria resolve its  financial problems in the shortest possible time.    Today the German military delegation had a meeting with  First  Deputy Foreign Minister Valentin Gatsinski. They discussed  issues concerning Bulgaria's relations with its neighbours and  Russia, the situation in the Balkans, the possibilities for  strengthening security in the region, and the Partnership for  Peace plan. In connection with the inclusion of Turkish troops  in the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] forces in Bosnia, Mr.  Gatsinski confirmed the Bulgarian position that no Balkan  countries should intervene in the Bosnia-Herzegovina conflict in  any form.</p>

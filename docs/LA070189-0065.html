			<p><P> July 1, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S., TAIWAN SIGN PACT TO MONITOR DRIFT-NET FISHING  </P> <P> The United States and Taiwan initialed a tentative North Pacific drift-net  agreement Friday just hours after the Taiwanese were given 60 days to sign and  implement such a pact or face possible American trade sanctions on their  fishery products.  </P> <P> The agreement allows for the "high seas boarding" of Taiwanese drift-net  vessels suspected of illegally catching U.S. salmon and requires the placement  of satellite transponders on all of the 166 Taiwanese ships involved.  </P> <P> The United States will use the transponders to keep track of the Taiwanese  fleet, and U.S. observers will be allowed to board Taiwanese vessels to monitor  their catch.  </P> <P> Under a 1987 law, Thursday was the deadline for reaching such monitoring and  enforcement agreements. A 60-day time clock started running; if agreements are  still not in force by the end of that period, the Bush Administration could  impose an embargo or other trade sanctions on Taiwanese fishery products.  </P> <P> State Department officials have said similar talks with South Korea may resume  in July, but no definite date has been set. A previous round of talks with the  Koreans in May failed to produce any progress.  </P></p>

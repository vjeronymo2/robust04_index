			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / People: Abbey's changing habit A significant shake-up at the top of Abbey National is under way nearly two years ahead of the retirement of John Bayliss, the man who, as managing director for retail operations, has powered ahead with the main business of the building society turned bank for the last eight years. Bayliss, 58, is now stepping up to be deputy chairman with overall responsibility for retail operations and the group's general insurance business. Charles Toner, Abbey National's European director, joins the group board as European director, becomes a member of the bank's executive committee, and will continue to run the European subsidiaries and Cornerstone, Abbey National's loss-making estate agents. Meanwhile, Ian Harley, 41, currently retail operations director, steps across to become group treasurer, while Gareth Jones, 43, the man who set up Abbey National's highly profitable treasury, becomes director of retail operations, reporting directly to Bayliss, in a move that suggests the two men are being groomed as possible successors to Peter Birch, Abbey National chief executive. They may have to wait a while, as Birch is not 60 until December 1997. ***** WOOLWICH Building Society is reshuffling its general managers following the early retirement of Terry Webb, 55, previously in charge of operations. John Stewart, 44, (left) steps into Webb's shoes as general manager retail operations. He had been general manager financial services. Peter Burton, 42, (right) is promoted to general manager, one level below the main board. He will continue to be in charge of customer administration  -but with the job upgraded in recognition of its increasing importance, according to the society. Huw Alderman, 42, who has been head of corporate planning, is made head of financial services - in turn no longer a general manager level appointment, since the financial service activities are now independent subsidiaries each run by a managing director. Michael Jennings, 39, previously estates controller, is appointed head of estates and premises. ***** David McCormack has been appointed md of LANDIS &amp; GYR COMMUNICATIONS (UK). ***** Robin Williams is appointed sales and marketing director of ROCKALL DATA SERVICES; he moves from DCE Communications Group. ***** Keith Nichols has been appointed director of manufacturing consultancy at EDS-Scicon, an independent subsidiary of General Motors. ***** Ian Jones, formerly financial controller for NCR's Europe group based in Ohio, is appointed director of finance and administration of NCR Limited in the UK; he succeeds Paul Entwistle. ***** Julian Onions has been appointed technical director of X-Tel SERVICES. ***** Michael Shea, the Queen's former press secretary and ex-diplomat who is now head of political and government affairs at Hanson, has been made a non-executive director of Murray International Trust, Murray Income Trust and Murray Smaller Markets Trust, three funds within the stable of Scottish fund manager Murray Johnstone. Chairman Nick McAndrew says he was attracted by the combination of Shea's 'very interesting foreign office background' together with his Hanson experience. At one point during his diplomatic career - before he went to the Palace - Shea had been head of chancery in Bucharest. McAndrew says the fund management company is keen to know more about emerging markets, particularly Eastern Europe. Shea, 54, has written about the delights of 'portfolio living', or being involved in a 'panoply of non-competing subjects' for those approaching the Third Age (supposed to begin at 55). Spending increasing amounts of time in Scotland, he is also chairman of Scotland in Europe; a visiting professor at the Graduate Business School of the University of Strathclyde; and a governor of his old school Gordonstoun.</p>

			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / French ministry waste criticised A confidential report by an Independent Court of Auditors has criticised the French foreign ministry for waste, bad accounting and steeply rising costs. However, the foreign minister, Mr Alain Juppe, maintained that the report referred to the period before his appointment, blaming his Socialist predecessor. The report, leaked to the weekly magazine L'Express, said the costs of official travel and the receipt of visiting VIPs by the French president and prime minister soared from FFr81.5m (Pounds 9.8m) in 1987 to FFr391m in 1991 before falling to FFr185m in 1992.

			<p><P> December 20, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORE MEDFLY SPRAYING  </P> <P> Jerome Marmorstein's article ("Our Rights Get a Dose of Malathion," California  Commentary, Dec. 4) reaffirms, once again, the old adage that a little bit of  knowledge is a dangerous thing. Like Dr. Marmorstein, I too am concerned about  the public health and environmental effects of chemical pesticides. However,  unlike Dr. Marmorstein, I have had the opportunity to study integrated pest  management at UC Berkeley, to serve as past-president of the Assn. of Applied  Insect Ecologists, and to travel to countries where the Medfly is  well-established.  </P> <P> If we do not eradicate the Medfly each time that it is introduced to this state  by a careless tourist, chemical pesticide use throughout California will  dramatically increase. The increase will not be temporary, like the current  aerial spraying, but will last for the rest of our lives. The area affected  will not be localized, like it is now, but will include millions of acres and  many cities.  </P> <P> I am not going to argue that malathion is 100% safe. But the dangers of  localized, temporary malathion treatments are preferable to the permanent,  widespread spraying that would occur, for the rest of our lives, if the Medfly  were to be established.  </P> <P> LARRY CARMEAN  </P> <P> Fresno  </P></p>

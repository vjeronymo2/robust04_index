			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / International Company News: Noranda reduces forestry stake Noranda, the resources group controlled by Toronto's Bronfman family, is further reducing its exposure to the forest products sector by cutting its stake in Noranda Forest, its pulp and paper subsidiary. Noranda is to sell 12m of its Noranda Forest shares to a group of underwriters, which will re-sell them to the public at a price of CDollars 12 each, or a total of CDollars 144m (USDollars 110.8m). The underwriting group is led by Gordon Capital of Toronto. The deal will reduce Noranda's equity stake in the forestry company from 83 per cent to 74 per cent. The proceeds are most likely to be used to finance an expansion of Noranda's mining and metals business. 'The opportunities at this point do seem to be on the metals side,' Noranda said yesterday. Mr Jonathan Challis, analyst at ScotiaMcLeod, said yesterday the funds would probably be earmarked for Falconbridge, the nickel producer 50 per cent-owned by Noranda. Falconbridge is expected to exercise a pre-emptive right to increase its one-third interest in the Collahuasi copper project in Chile. Billiton, the European metals group, has indicated its willingness to sell its one-third stake in Collahuasi. The remaining one third is held by Minorco, the South African-controlled mining group. Noranda said funds were also required for the Louvicourt copper mine, currently under construction in Quebec. The company is also considering an entry into magnesium production. Noranda and its subsidiaries have spun off several assets in an effort to bolster cash-flow without taking on new debt. Sagging metal and forest products prices have created a shortfall in recent years between cash from operations and financing requirements for capital projects and dividends. Earlier this year, Noranda Forest sold its controlling interest in MacMillan Bloedel, the west coast forest products group. It has also sold its stake in a British Columbia paper mill. However, Mr Challis said he expected a marked improvement in Noranda's cash-flows over the next year, thanks to the recent strength of natural gas prices and brighter prospects in some other commodity markets.</p>

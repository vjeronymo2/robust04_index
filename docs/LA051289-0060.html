			<p><P> May 12, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HE WON'T TAKE PREMIER JOB, ITO TELLS TAKESHITA  </P> <P> Masayoshi Ito, the ruling party's choice to succeed Noboru Takeshita as Japan's  prime minister, informed Takeshita today that he will not accept any offer to  take over as Takeshita's successor.  </P> <P> Ito, chairman of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's executive board, told  the outgoing prime minister that any further delay in making his position clear  would create an "imposition" on the ruling party. He also asked that a meeting  of the party's chief executives be called later today to allow him to make his  decision known to them. The decision left the ruling party with no clear choice  for a new leader.  </P> <P> Ito's move came during a three-hour meeting over dinner Thursday after he  presented demands to Takeshita for reforms that he insists the party adopt  before choosing a successor.  </P> <P> It was the first meeting between Ito, who is 75 and diabetic, and Takeshita  since the prime minister announced April 25 that he will resign because of a  scandal that has touched all the party's recognized leaders.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Viewed as Sole Choice  </P> <P> Ito, although lacking a personal following, had been regarded as the only party  figure untouched by the scandal who commands enough respect to lead the party.  </P> <P> Details of his demands were not disclosed, but the two leaders said they agreed  that a conclusion to the scandal must be worked out.  </P> <P> Earlier, Takeshita told Parliament that his resignation is only his "personal  conclusion" to the scandal, in which Recruit Co., an information and real  estate conglomerate, dispensed stock and campaign contributions to 168  politicians, businessmen and journalists.  </P> <P> Takeshita denied he was involved in anything illegal, but he acknowledged that  his aides received more than $1.5 million from Recruit in stock profits,  contributions and loans.  </P> <P> Ito has demanded dissolution of the party's factions -- groups of Parliament  members who pledge loyalty and obedience in exchange for funds that factional  leaders distribute to them. He has complained that the Liberal Democrats,  instead of committing themselves to reform, have focused their attention on  gaining factional power within the new party structure and the new Cabinet that  will be chosen after Takeshita steps down.  </P> <P> Takeshita said he will leave office after the fiscal 1989 budget is approved, a  step expected no later than May 28.  </P> <P> The prime minister, spokesmen said, told Ito that immediate dissolution of the  factions is impossible. They said he proposed that reforms be studied to  transfer power gradually from the factions to party organs.  </P> <P> The two agreed to work out details of a reform package before choosing a new  leader.  </P> <P> Earlier, Takeshita said he is prepared to ask party members in the legislature  who profited from Recruit stock to "return their gains to society." He said he  will return profits that an aide and a relative obtained in transactions in  1986, when he was finance minister.  </P> <P> Takeshita has agreed with Shintaro Abe, the party secretary general, that his  successor should be given a full two-year term as party president -- the  president of the ruling party is also prime minister -- and not be considered  the head of a caretaker government.  </P> <P> A recent opinion poll by the newspaper Asahi found that only a quarter of the  voters said they would vote for Liberal Democratic candidates if an election  were held now. But no election for the powerful lower house of Parliament,  which chooses the prime minister, is expected before July, 1990.  </P></p>

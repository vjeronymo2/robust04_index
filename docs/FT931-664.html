			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / Growth in world trade speeds up after 3 years: A look at Gatt's annual world trade report WORLD trade growth accelerated in 1992 after three years of slowdown, according to figures published today by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The main stimulus came from North America and Asia. Gatt forecasts in its annual world trade report that trade growth in 1993 will 'at least equal' 1992, but warns that 'much of the risk is on the downside'. Noting that trade grew more slowly during the second half of 1992 as western Europe and Japan fell into recession, it said the acceleration needed to better 1992 'may be difficult to achieve'. The value of world trade grew by 5.5 per cent to Dollars 3,700bn (Pounds 2,605bn), compared with growth of 1.5 per cent in 1991. The volume rose by 4.5 per cent, reversing a period of steady slowing since 1988, when growth fell from more than 8 per cent to 3.5 per cent in 1991. The US maintained its position as the world's leading exporter, lifting sales by 6 per cent to Dollars 447bn. Behind it, Germany boosted exports by 6.5 per cent to Dollars 425bn. Strongest gains came from China and Hong Kong, where exports rose by 18.2 per cent and 20 per cent respectively. Taken together, they would overtake the UK to be the fifth biggest exporter. The US remained by far the leading importer, with a rise of 8.6 per cent to Dollars 552bn; Germany was a distant second with Dollars 408bn. A 1.8 per cent fall by Japan to Dollars 233bn resulted in France overtaking it as the third largest importer. It bought merchandise worth Dollars 240bn, up 3.4 per cent from Dollars 232bn in 1991. The greatest jump in imports came in Latin America, up 18.5 per cent to Dollars 170bn. Mexico became the 17th biggest importer, with a rise of 23.5 per cent from Dollars 66bn to Dollars 82bn. Argentina, Chile and Venezuela also saw strong surges. At a time when 'trade has been a source of relative strength in an otherwise mostly weak economic environment', Gatt calls for markets to be kept open, and for fresh efforts to conclude the Uruguay Round of talks on trade liberalisation. The report shows trade in services growing from Dollars 890bn to Dollars 960bn last year, a rise of 8 per cent. At the same time, the economies of central and eastern Europe began to show the first signs of export recovery since their painful transitions to market economies. While exports slipped by 10 per cent to Dollars 85bn - an improvement from a 25 per cent slump in 1991 - sales to western Europe jumped by 20 per cent.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by D.W., based on a report of the Institute for the </F> Study of Foreign Trade Business Cycles and Prices entitled  "Foreign Investments in Poland," published in Warsaw in 1994:  ""Good but Not Excellent: How Foreign Investors Grade Poland"]    [Text] The Institute for the Study of Foreign Trade  Business Cycles and Prices (IKC) has published its fourth  regular report on foreign investment in Poland. The report  discusses in detail the legal and economic conditions of  investing in Poland. It was authored by Ewa Sadowska Cieslak,  Jozef Biskup, and Wojciech Burzynski.    On the basis of studies by the report's authors, it can be  concluded that the biggest incentives for investing in Poland  are, in this order: prospects for our economic growth (about  53.5 percent of the respondents); the size of the Polish market  (47.5 percent of the respondents); manpower costs (44.7 percent  of the respondents); the availability of manpower (33.9  percent); the possibility of reducing production costs (31.6  percent); price level (27.9 percent); advantageous conditions  for investing (27.5 percent); and the possibility of  repatriating profits (27 percent).  <H5>  A Potentially Attractive Country </H5>   Thus, in the opinion of the report's authors, Poland appears  to be a potentially attractive country. Another advantage is  that Poland can become a big importer of manufacturing capital  in view of its capacious market, so-called deferred (and  unsatisfied) demand, and the enlargement of that market, owing  to the free-trade zone shared with the other Visegrad countries  [Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary]. As a result of the still  low efficiency of most Polish enterprises, considerable profits  can be derived from selling in this country products whose  manufacture in highly industrialized countries by now yields  only below-average profits.    Foreign investors considering the possibility of capital  investment in our country attach considerable importance to the  very fact that a market economy is being built here. This factor  was ranked first by 86 percent of U.S. investors, 82 percent of  Swedish and Dutch investors, and 80 percent of French investors.  The second-ranking attraction was identified as privatization  (67 percent of British and U.S. investors, 63 percent of Swedish  investors, and 76 percent of French investors). In its turn, to  46.7 percent of French investors, 45 percent of U.S. ones, 39  percent of Dutch, and 38 percent of German, a major factor in  their decisionmaking was the possibility of purchasing land and  real estate.  <H5>  A Good Policy </H5>   Contrary to traditional belief, about one-half of the  investors viewed positively the policy of the Polish Government  regarding foreign investments. Most respondents were of the  opinion that the political situation in Poland did not affect  their activities.    Nearly three-fourths of major investors planned to expand  their operations in this country, but nearly as many hold a very  low opinion of the taxes binding in our country (83 percent of  Italian investors, 88 percent of Swiss, 67 percent of German).  And they are not satisfied with the operating procedures of  commercial risk insurance, either. They also hold an unfavorable  opinion about the credit insurance system.  <H5>  Hungary Is Better </H5>   The foreign investors answering the questionnaires shared  the  opinion that Poland is among the countries with the most  favorable conditions for investment by foreign capital.  Nevertheless, they ranked Hungary first in that respect. This is  also proved by the amount of capital invested in that country.  By the end of 1993, more than $5 billion had been invested in  Hungary compared with only half that amount in Poland, although  declarations for further investment plans suggest an amount  three times larger.    As known, the Americans are the biggest investors in Poland  (on average, they invested $23 million in each of the companies  they decided to buy shares in), followed by Italy, with third  place held by four transnational corporations (including ABB,  Hewlett Packard, and the issuer [as published] of Cambridge  Holding) and three international financial institutions. The  Japanese were a big disappointment, but they were not interested  in investing in our country until the completion of our  negotiations with the Club of London. Capital investment was too  expensive for them in a situation in which, for every dollar  invested, a matching dollar had to be deposited in a bank. The  IKC report mentions, however, several companies, including  Toyota, Nisho Iwai, and Itochu, which committed themselves to  selling in our country Mazdas, Toyotas, and Hondas, as well as  several other companies, including Mitsui. However, altogether  Japanese companies account for n 0.3-percent share in  investments in Poland.    In a situation in which Poland is experiencing a major  foreign trade deficit, it is important that investors also  manufacture for export. Thus, while in 1989 the value of exports  deriving from their enterprises amounted to $179.9 million, in  1990 it rose to $516 million, in 1991 to $631 million, and in  1992 to $1.3 billion. Exports per company with participation of  foreign capital averaged $230,000 in 1992. Even so, as many as  75 companies are geared to sell their products on the domestic  market, and the value of their exports did not exceed $37  million altogether. Furniture and wood products are the best  exports, followed by garments, with products of the pulp and  paper industry ranking third and those of the electronics  industry fourth.    According to the data gathered by the report's authors,  companies with the participation of foreign capital offer higher  wages, and, in general, their existence has improved the  situation on the job market. Such companies also are  characterized by higher labor productivity. It also often  happens that, while employment increases in the foreign branches  of these companies, including their branches in Poland, it  decreases in their mother countries. At any rate, in 12  countries of Central and East Europe a year ago (latest  available data), 65,000 companies operated with the  participation of foreign capital.</p>

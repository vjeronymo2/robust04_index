			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / Leading Article: Bundesbank's slow tease DOUBTLESS, many reservations were expressed at yesterday's Bundesbank council meeting about the adequacy of last weekend's Solidarity Pact. But the bank had no reason to puncture the bubble of optimism that last weekend's agreement has inflated around Germany's politicians. Hence, it duly obliged with a half point cut in the discount rate. This latest rate cut does not, in fact, signal a change in policy. The Bundesbank, by regularly dropping the discount rate floor and then allowing its money market rates to catch up, has permitted short-term interest rates to fall by 2 percentage points since September; long-term rates have fallen too. Yesterday's move suggests that the process will continue at a similar pace. This modest easing reflects the modest pace at which Germany's current economic imbalances are righting themselves. Wage settlements in west Germany show signs of moderating but inflation remains stuck above 4 per cent. The Bundesbank's broad money aggregate contracted in February relative to its bloated fourth quarter base but is still rising at more than 7 per cent on an annual basis. The solidarity pact's tax increases and spending cuts bring some predictability to fiscal policy, but confirm that Germany's fiscal day of reckoning has only been postponed. German industry will argue that the Bundesbank could now ease policy a little faster, given the fall in inflationary expectations and the medium-term need for a sizeable D-Mark depreciation against the dollar. But there can be no doubt that the bank's recent performance has been exemplary. It appears to have contained post-unification excesses without letting inflation rise above 4 1/2 per cent, while the German economy has still managed to grow by an average 2 1/2 per cent a year since the beginning of 1989. For France, by contrast, German's monetary relaxation began a year too late and looks set to proceed too slowly. Germany's economic satellites  - Belgium, Denmark and the Netherlands - used yesterday's rate cut to obtain further monetary relief. But the German reduction failed to ease the pressure on the French franc. The differential between German and French short-term rates has now widened from near parity last summer to 3 1/2 percentage points, as market fears of a post-election Franc devaluation have grown. The French authorities may well resist a devaluation, given the fundamentally sound state of the French economy, but the costs will continue to be high. Meanwhile, as if to rub salt into French wounds, sterling rallied yesterday against the D-Mark, despite the considerably more feeble state of the UK economy. The British government should now be able to follow Tuesday's tax-raising budget with a cut in interest rates to aid recovery. To the gnashing of Parisian teeth, chancellor Norman Lamont should take his chances while he can.</p>

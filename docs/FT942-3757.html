			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / (CORRECTED) European Elections '94: Victory sweet for Kohl - Germany Correction (published 15th June 1994) appended to this article. Chancellor Helmut Kohl could not disguise his glee, nor wipe the smile from his face, when he appeared on German television close to midnight on Sunday. His Christian Democratic Union had confounded the opinion polls and the pundits, and emerged from the European elections stronger than in 1989. The party saw an increase of 2.5 percentage points in its support, in spite of a sharp economic recession and record unemployment levels in both halves of the country. He saw it, justifiably, as vindication for his absolute self-confidence, and a refusal to bow to apparent unpopularity in the polls. In particular, he forced his party to fight the campaign on a platform of firm commitment to European integration, in spite of signs that the policy could be unpopular. Mr Rudolf Scharping, leader of the Social Democratic party (SPD) and his challenger for the chancellorship next October, looked bemused: his party, only four weeks ago enjoying a clear lead in public favour, had lost more than 5 percentage points, and recorded its worst result in a European election since they began in 1979. The expectations had been for a strong protest vote and a low turnout. Everyone cautioned against reading too much into the result to predict what will happen in October. But the protest turned out to be against the main party of opposition, and the turnout was respectable at nearly 60 per cent. It was a day of unlikely bedfellows: a good day for Mr Kohl and for the Greens, who also improved their 1989 showing by a couple of percentage points. Mr Kohl's Bavarian allies, the Christian Social Union (CSU), lost a little support, but still emerged handsome victors in their home state - with easily enough backing to win seats in the parliament. And the Party of Democratic Socialism, the former East German communist party, almost made it to Strasbourg, thanks to a strong vote in the five eastern Lander. On the other hand, it was not only a severe setback for Mr Scharping and his party. It was a bad day for Mr Kohl's junior partners in the coalition, the Free Democratic party (FDP), which failed to get the 5 per cent support necessary for seats in parliament. It was also a bad day for the far-right Republicans, down from 7.1 per cent in 1989 to 3.9 per cent. Last of all it was a bad day for the anti-Maastricht campaigners, such as Mr Manfred Brunner's Free Citizens' Alliance, which just managed 1.1 per cent support. On the whole, the German electorate was conservative with a small c, sticking to the devils they knew: Mr Kohl in the west, the CSU in Bavaria, and the old communists in the east, along with the CDU. In spite of the surprising changes, the outlook for October remains too close to call. On each side of the political divide, neither combined left nor combined right can command a clear coalition majority on the basis of these figures. The FDP, on past experience, must be expected to squeak back over the 5 per cent hurdle for the national election in October. The PDS can be expected to do the same. The Republicans, for the time being, appear to be finished. If neither the SPD nor the CDU can break out of support at around one-third of the electorate, they may be condemned to form a grand coalition.  ---------------------------------------------- Population: 80.6m Seats: 90  ---------------------------------------------- Results (Turnout 58.0%; 1989, 62.3%)  ---------------------------------------------- Party*     Parliament     % vote       Seats              group     '94    '89   '94    '89  ---------------------------------------------- SPD           PES     32.2   37.3    40     31 CDU           EPP     32.0   29.5    39     25 Greens     Greens     10.1    8.4    12      8 CSU           EPP      6.8    8.2     8      7 FDP           LDR      4.1    5.6     0      4 Rep            NA      3.9    7.1     0      6  ---------------------------------------------- Source: Chief electoral officer  ---------------------------------------------- *Abbreviations: SPD = Social Democrats; CDU = Christian Democratic Union; CSU = Christian Social Union; FDP = Free Democrats; Rep = Republicans Parliamentary group abbreviations: see bottom front page this section  ---------------------------------------------- Electoral system:  ---------------------------------------------- Proportional from regional lists Compulsory voting: No  ---------------------------------------------- MEPs  ---------------------------------------------- SPD  ---------------------------------------------- Klaus Hansch, Magdalene Hoff, Gerhard Schmid, Erika Mann, Wilfried Kuckelkorn, Heinke Salisch, Willi Gorlach, Constanze Krehl, Willi Rothley, Dagmar Roth-Behrendt, Mechthild Rothe, Wilhelm Piecyk, Lissy Groner, Norbert Glante, Gunter Luttge, Christa Randzio-Plath, Ulrich Stockmann, Gerhard Botz, Peter Helwin, Karin Jons, Heinz Kindermann, Bernhard Rapkay, Karin Junker, Rolf Linkohr, Barbara Weiler, Helmut Kuhne, Jannis Sakellariou, Bernd Lange, Ralf Walter, Barbara Schmidbauer, Martin Schulz, Detlev Samland, Rosemarie Wemheuer, Evelyne Gebhardt, Jutta Haug, Maria Zimmerman, Annemarie Kuhn, Axel Schafer, Klaus Rehder, Christof Tannert  ---------------------------------------------- CDU-CSU  ---------------------------------------------- Reimer Boge, Georg Jarzembowski, Hans-Gert Pottering, Godelieve Quisthoudt-Rowohl, Karsten Hoppenstedt, Brigitte Langenhagen, Hedwig Keppelhoff-Wiechert, Gunter Rinsche, Elmar Brok, Karl-Heinz Flozenz, Marlene Lenz, Hans-Peter Liese, Kurt Malangre, Klaus-Heiner Lehne, Christoph Konrad, Peter-Michael Mombaur, Hartmut Nassauer, Marlies Mosiek-Urbahn, Thomas Mann, Werner Josef Langen, Otto Bardong, Christa Barbara Klass, Siegbert Alber, Diemut Theato, Karl von Wogau, Honor Funk, Winfried Josef Menrad, Konrad Karl Schwaiger, Renate Heinisch, Doris Pack, Peter Kittelmann, Anne Karin Glase, Alfred Gomolka, Jurgen Schroder, Lutz Goepel, Stanislav Tillich, Kurt Oswald Horst Schnellhardt, Rolf Berend, Dieter-Lebrecht Koch  ---------------------------------------------- FDP  ---------------------------------------------- Uta Wurfel, Mechthild von Alemann, Manfred Voher, Stefanie Wolf, Klaus Wettig, Georgios Chatzimarkakis, Annette Sievers, Ute Georgi, Karl Partsch, Martin Holzfuss, Gisela Zeidler, Wilfried Hofmann  ---------------------------------------------- Green  ---------------------------------------------- Claudia Roth,Wolfgang Ullmann, Hiltrud Breyer, Friedrich Otto Wolf, Elisabeth Schroedter, Friedrich-Wilhelm Graefe zu Baringdorf, Undine Bloch von Blottnitz, Daniel Marc Cohn-Bendit, Wolfgang Kreissl-Dorfler, Irene Soltwedel-Schafer, Wilfried Telkamper, Edith Muller  ---------------------------------------------- CSU  ---------------------------------------------- Ingo Friedrich, Ursula Schleicher, Otto Habsburg-Lothringen, Gunther Maren, Xaver Mayer, Markus Ferber, Edgar Schiedermeier, Bernd Posselt Based on preliminary results issued by the European Parliament.

Because the FDP scored less than 5 per cent of the vote in the elections in Germany, no MEPs from this party will sit in the new parliament.</p>

The TEC management  committee was mandated to take whatever steps it felt were  necessary to ensure free and fair elections in the territory.    The TEC passed the resolution after being presented with a  report alleging kwaZulu government and kwaZulu Police [KZP]  complicity in hit squad activity. The report, compiled by  attorneys Fink Haysom and Howard Varney and the SAP's [South  African Police] Col Ivor Human, recommended the KZP be brought  under South African Police jurisdiction ahead of the April 27  election.    Although the TEC decided on no specific or immediate steps,  the report's conclusions will help inform management committee  members of the steps believed to be necessary to ensure a free  and fair election in Natal. It calls on the kwaZulu  administration to co-operate with all electoral organs, the  South African Government and with civil service rationalisation.    It also recommends indemnity be considered for police  officers who have information on hit squad activities.    The investigations team began its work in December after a  Goldstone Commission report said hit squads were probably  operating in Natal/kwaZulu.    Investigators heard evidence ranging from KZP involvement in  hit squad activity to the involvement of the department of the  chief minister of kwaZulu, Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the report said.    "The pattern which emerges from the evidence is obvious and  repetitive. It repeatedly refers to certain individuals and  similarly reveals a clear pattern with regard to the response by  the kwaZulu Police to hit squad activity."    It notes that "hit squad activity in Natal and particularly  in the area of jurisdiction of the KZP is rife. The number of  deaths caused by these hit squads is unquantifiable but would  represent a significant proportion of those who have died in  political violence in kwazulu and natal." The report said some  of the hit squad activities could be associated with people who  underwent training in the Caprivi Strip in 1986 and who now  operated within the KZP. These trainees had later been trained  by the SAP and deployed in the Pietermaritzburg area.    It said some officials of the Inkatha Freedom Party and  employees of a kwaZulu government department were implicated in  hit squad activity.    Victims included members of the African National Congress  and  KZP policemen perceived to be disloyal to the IFP.    There was evidence that investigations were being hampered  by  the "highest echelons of the KZP".    "The task group is satisfied that there are linkages and  connections between different elements engaged in gun running  and hit squad activity inside and outside the security forces,  both in the Transvaal and Natal."    It recommends a single unified investigative team assisted  by  international figures and that the Caprivi trainees be  transferred from active policing.    "We recommend further the immediate cessation of the issue  and distribution of all firearms, including semi-automatic  weapons from or through the department of the chief minister of  kwaZulu."    Finally, it recommends that the KZP give exact details of  steps it intends implementing to prevent hit squad activities in  the run-up to the elections and the possible revocation of the  authority of the kwaZulu government to establish its own police  force.</p>

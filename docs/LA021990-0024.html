			<p><P> February 19, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: LEGAL FILE  </P> <P> Director Files $6-Million Suit: Director Adrian Lyne claims he is still owed  money from making the movie "9 1/2 Weeks." Lyne, who also directed "Flashdance"  and "Fatal Attraction," went to court Friday in Los Angeles, saying the  production company Jonesfilm and financier Sidney Kimmel agreed to pay him  $200,000 two years after the movie was released in 1986. Lyne claims his  contract entitled him to 10% of the gross receipts from the Kim Basinger/Micky  Rourke film, so he's seeking more than $6 million in damages, an accounting of  the film's box office receipts and an injunction to prevent "9 1/2 Weeks" from  being distributed or exhibited.

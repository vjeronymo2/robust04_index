			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "G. Luc.": "Dalla Chiesa: `Rete a Loser'"] </F>   [Excerpt] Milan -- The decision was announced last night,  to general incredulity and stupor, at the movement's meeting in  Bruzzano, on the northern fringes of Milan. Nando Dalla Chiesa  is leaving the Rete, the party he founded jointly in January  1991 with Orlando, Novelli, Galasso and others, and for which he  was a deputy from April 1992 to 27 March of this year. He  turned down Novelli's suggestion that he run in the European  elections. He failed to win reelection in the general election,  but will remain on the city council while returning to  university. Dalla Chiesa explained to journalists: "My  disagreement is political, a radical choice, but there is no  bitterness." He no longer identifies with the plans of [Rete  Secretary] Leoluca Orlando and the Rete's national committee to  break up the movement and without delay move toward building the  Democratic Party. He objects: "It is a lame project for a  defeated, one-legged left, a kind of extended Democratic Party  of the Left [PDS]. On the contrary, the Left should stand on  two legs: the red flag and the movements for civil society."  Hence his rejection of the Rete "as a bridge between the  People's Party and the PDS, and of the policy of remaining mere  shrubs in the shadow of oak tree [PDS symbol]." Anyone  contemplating this path "has not learned the lesson of the  elections."    Leoluca Orlando, the Rete's national coordinator, reacted  uncontroversially: "We will go forward, irrespective of  obstacles and difficulties, to give real answers to real  questions, free from attempts at hegemony, and free from the  constraints of ideology and political machinations."

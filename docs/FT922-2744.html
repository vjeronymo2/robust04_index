			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Germany to push for entry of three more EC members by 1995 CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl will press for Austria, Sweden and Finland to join the European Community by 1995 at next week's EC summit in Lisbon. If the community did not push on urgently with enlargement, the 'virus' of nationalism could delay European political union by 25 years or more, he told a meeting of Christian Democrat (CDU) party leaders and officials. Attempting to rally his unsettled party behind a quick-fire programme of international and domestic initiatives, Mr Kohl skated over the imponderables thrown up by the Danish referendum's rejection of the Maastricht treaties. However, he accepted that community leaders might not have explained the implications of economic, political and monetary union clearly enough. Stressing the benefits to Germany of EC membership, he asked party leaders to explain to voters that unification in 1990 had changed radically the country's political priorities. As for the proposed single European currency, one of the most contentious EC issues, he would not support anything which did mot match the stability of the D-Mark. Mr Peter Hintze, the CDU's new general secretary, complained of the 'discrepancy' between the party's achievements and popular opinion and called for a 'movement back to the people' through a fundamental reform of political communications. Latest opinion polls show the CDU's popular support lagging 5 percentage points behind that of the opposition Social Democrats (SPD) and 'an epidemic of mistrust' of politicians. The CDU's support in the former GDR is also threatened by disenchantment with the mainstream parties. Mr Peter Diestel, former leader of the CDU group in the Brandenburg state parliament, has threatened to form a cross-party 'Eastern Movement' in protest at the 'emotional humiliation' of people in the five new federal states. In response, Mr Kohl said the CDU should take advantage of the 'disorientation' among the opposition, and use the opportunity quickly to resolve outstanding problems in social and budgetary policy. Ruling out a 'grand coalition' with the SPD and claiming Mr Diestel's project would achieve nothing, he called for an end to divisive east/west thinking in Germany. Reconstruction in the east had absolute priority, he said. Promising to announce a firm budget policy in the next few weeks, he said 'we can only win the 1994 general election if we keep national finances under control.' The offer of early membership to all interested members of the European Free Trade Area (Efta) would help counter resurgent nationalist tendencies threatening to hamper political integration, he claimed. No-one should believe that chauvinism and nationalism were confined to Serbia, Croatia or the Balkans. 'There is no European country ' including Germany ' which can claim to be free of this virus,' he said. Mr Kohl agreed with Mr John Major, UK prime minister, earlier this month on the need for the 'speedy initiation and conduct' of entry negotiations for Efta members. France, however, is more concerned that the bonds between the 12 should be tightened before membership is thrown open.</p>

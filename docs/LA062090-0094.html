			<p><P> June 20, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> RED SOX PULL TO WITHIN ONE GAME OF BLUE JAYS  </P> <P> The Blue Jays returned to Toronto after a 9-1 trip, the best in the team's  history, feeling they were ready to break open the race in the American League  East.  </P> <P> But the Boston Red Sox, behind rookie pitcher Dana Kiecker, beat the Blue Jays,  4-2, and moved to within a game of first place.  </P> <P> Kiecker gave up only three hits and two unearned runs in 8 1/3 innings. But the  unearned runs meant the Red Sox had to win it in the ninth.  </P> <P> With the score 2-2, Toronto relief pitcher Duane Ward walked Dwight Evans to  open the ninth. Ellis Burks hit a triple to center field past a diving Mookie  Wilson to break the tie, and Burks scored on an infield out by Tony Pena as the  Red Sox won their 12th in the last 17 games.  </P> <P> Rob Murphy relieved Kiecker and struck out the last two Blue Jays, Fred McGriff  and John Olerud.  </P> <P> "I figure I learned a few things in seven years in the minors, " Kiecker (2-3)  said. "But I would have enjoyed pitching a complete game.  </P> <P> "I had a good fastball and when I retired 15 in a row I thought I could do it.  The big thing is, we won."  </P> <P> In his last three starts, Kiecker, 29, has pitched 20 1/3 innings and has not  given up more than one hit in any of those innings.  </P> <P> "That was a giant win," Murphy said. "Every win is a big one, but now we're  only one game back of Toronto instead of three. I had my mechanics going for  me. All of a sudden the strikes were coming and the outs followed."  </P> <P> Detroit 7, Oakland 6 -- Perhaps his knee was bothering him, because it was not  the Dave Stewart the Athletics have come to rely on who took the mound at  Detroit.  </P> <P> Stewart (9-5) gave up a three-run home run to Alan Trammell in the first inning  and the Tigers scored seven runs against him in the first four innings.  </P> <P> Ordinarily, six runs is easily enough for Stewart, who is trying to become a  20-game winner for the fourth consecutive season.  </P> <P> The Hendersons, Dave and Rickey, hit home runs, but Paul Gibson and Mike  Henneman stopped them for the last 5 1/3 innings.  </P> <P> The Tigers have won six of their last seven games and are only 5 1/2 games out  of first place in the East.  </P> <P> It was the second game in a row in which Trammell hit a three-run home run in  the first inning. The Athletics gave an intentional pass to Trammell to load  the bases in the fourth, but Cecil Fielder singled in two runs, and the Tigers  were in front to stay.  </P> <P> "We had to try to set up the double play," Manager Tony LaRussa of the  Athletics said. "We thought Fielder might hit it on the ground. He did, but not  at anybody."  </P> <P> Cleveland 5, Baltimore 4 -- Light-hitting Felix Fermin doubled off relief ace  Gregg Olson and scored the winning run in the ninth at Cleveland on Sandy  Alomar's single.  </P> <P> Fermin, who is batting .217, had had only seven extra-base hits in 138 previous  at-bats. The double was only the third extra-base hit off Olson this season.  </P> <P> The Indians have won four in a row and the Orioles have lost six of their last  seven.  </P> <P> Texas 5, Minnesota 4 -- Pete Incaviglia hit a 411-foot home run in the seventh  inning at Arlington, Tex., to hand the Twins their 11th loss in the last 12  games.  </P> <P> Incaviglia's 11th home run made a winner of Brad Arnsberg, who pitched a  hitless inning. Kenny Rogers earned his fourth save.  </P> <P> The Twins had scored two runs in the top of the seventh to tie the score.  </P> <P> Kansas City 2, Seattle 1 -- Kevin Seitzer tripled home the winning run at  Kansas City and the Mariners stranded 12 baserunners.  </P> <P> The Royals used five pitchers, with Steve Farr (5-3) going the first five.  </P> <P> Seitzer's triple scored Frank White, who had singled to make the score 2-0 in  the second inning.  </P> <P> The Mariners loaded the bases in the seventh with two outs, but second baseman  White robbed Pete O'Brien of a hit to retire the side.  </P> <P> New York 5, Milwaukee 1 -- The punchless Yankees built a four-run lead for only  the third time in their last 23 games and won at Milwaukee. There were two rain  delays.  </P> <P> Chuck Cary (4-2) gave up five hits but no runs in six innings, leaving the game  after the first rain delay.  </P> <P> Mel Hall hit a two-run home run for the Yankees, who ended a four-game losing  streak. The Yankees have won only five of their last 23; the Brewers have won  only eight of their last 27. DAN HAFNER  </P></p>

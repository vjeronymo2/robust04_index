			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor: Accountancy needs to emphasise 'true and fair' Sir, It was refreshing to read Roger Davis's argument that accountants and accounts users are suffering from a surfeit of accounting standards ('Mass of fine print may obscure judgments', August 19). While the Accounting Standards Board is busily weaving yet another cat's cradle of rules to cover every eventuality in the accounting calendar, too few people have been prepared to stand back to consider if this is really the right road to be travelling. I take the view that many of the accounts-related problems of recent years can be attributed to inadequate standards of accounting and auditing, rather than to inadequate accounting standards. Mr Davis's plea for a return to an emphasis on personal judgment and the spirit of 'true and fair' deserves to have the support of the profession. Regrettably, the professional bodies are busily engaged elsewhere as they seek to fulfil the role of the statutory enforcement agency for the new auditing regulatory regime, which has been thrust on them by a government that shies away from picking up the bill and the responsibility itself. Meanwhile, the leading auditing companies are too busy fighting for the top positions in the league tables that have become the virility symbol of professional status. This leaves them with little time or inclination to take a detached view of where company reporting is going. Indeed, they probably believe that a complex accounting rule book strengthens their claim to a monopoly of wisdom in this area. Desmond Goch, 4 Paddock Wood, Harpenden, Herts AL5 1JX</p>

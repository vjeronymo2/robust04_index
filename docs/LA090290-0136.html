			<p><P> September 2, 1990, Sunday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OXNARD;  </P> <P> REWARD URGED AS WAY TO CURB GRAFFITI  </P> <P> In an effort to reduce graffiti, Oxnard City Manager Vern Hazen has recommended  that the City Council offer a reward of up to $250 for anyone who reports and  helps apprehend graffiti vandals.  </P> <P> The recommendation was made in a memo to the City Council last week.  </P> <P> Mayor Nao Takasugi had asked the staff last month to investigate how to reduce  the proliferation of graffiti in the city.  </P> <P> In response to the mayor's request, Hazen and representatives of the city  attorney, police, Public Works Department, Parks and Recreation Department and  Code Enforcement Department met early this month to discuss options. One of the  suggestions was to charge property owners for the cost of removing graffiti  from residences and businesses.  </P> <P> Among other ideas for reducing graffiti, staff members suggested that the city  adopt an ordinance that prohibits the sale of aerosol paint to minors.  </P> <P> The proposals to reduce graffiti will be discussed by the City Council sometime  in the next three weeks, according to the memo.

Nikolay Yegorov told an ITAR-TASS correspondent that the  president showed that he is very well informed about business  and political life in the Kuban. He enquired about the course  of spring field work, and the provision of Russia's breadbasket  with fuel, mineral fertilizers, and other material and technical  resources on the eve of the new sowing campaign.    Nikolay Yegorov said that the president paid particular  attention to discussing the problems of Krasnodar Kray as a  territory on Russia's southern border. Issues of the migration  of the population from CIS "trouble spots" were discussed. The  president agreed with the proposal by the kray's leadership  temporarily to introduce a visa regime on the territory of  Krasnodar Kray while the acute situations in the Transcaucasus  region continue. Nikolay Yegorov said that the Russian  leadership will apparently adopt an appropriate document on this  matter very soon.    The conversation lasted about five hours. [passage omitted]</p>

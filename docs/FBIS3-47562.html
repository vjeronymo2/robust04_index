Gen. Tetsuya Nishimoto, chairman of the Joint Staff Council  of Japan's Self-Defense Forces, paid a courtesy call on Gen.  John Shalikashvili, chairman of the U.S. joint chiefs of staff,  at the Pentagon.    Nishimoto later told reporters that he discussed North  Korea's nuclear program and other matters with Shalikashvili,  and got the impression that "the U.S. has been negotiating very  patiently" with Pyongyang over the nuclear issue.    The United States is formulating a comprehensive policy  approach toward North Korea that focuses not only on the nuclear  issue but also takes into account North Korea's missile  development program, its vast military power and possible  involvement in international terrorism, he said.    Nishimoto is currently on a three-day visit to the United  States as Shalikashvili's official guest.</p>

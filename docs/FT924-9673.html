			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market report London's robusta COFFEE erased losses and established a fresh nine-month high, tracking a similar turn-round in New York as the markets resumed their upward trends after absorbing bouts of profit taking. Dealers said the mood remained constructive. With little sign of origins selling aggressively into the rally, there appears to be potential for the market to go even higher. The January contract closed Dollars 12 higher at Dollars 947 a tonne after peaking at Dollars 950. A hesitant tone was evident in LME BASE METALS in the afternoon, with earlier falls halted by short covering ahead of a possible bounce in prices once uncertainty over the US election outcome is resolved. One broker's report suggested that Clinton's pledge to improve infrastructure clearly suggested spending on transport and communications, indicating support for copper, aluminium and steel markets. New York COTTON futures hit the 2 cent daily limit after a report said that China's 1992-93 output was sharply down. Compiled from Reuters</p>

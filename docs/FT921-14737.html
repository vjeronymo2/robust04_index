			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / International Company News: Chase Manhattan falls to Dollars 135m CHASE Manhattan, the New York money-centre bank, yesterday reported fourth-quarter net income of Dollars 135m, down from Dollars 193m last year when its figures were flattered by a Dollars 51m after-tax gain from the sale of overseas real estate. The results, which were broadly in line with market expectations, underlined the efforts Chase has been making to cut its costs and the improved spreads US banks have been enjoying between the cost of borrowing and lending money. However, the figures also point up the continuing impact on bank profits of the American property market slump. Chase's net interest revenue during the fourth quarter rose from Dollars 839m last year to Dollars 868m, which, it said, reflected improved spreads on interest-earning assets, partially offset by a higher average level of non-performing assets and the effects of asset securitisation. Its net interest margin - the difference between the average cost of deposits and average yield on loans and other assets - was 3.95 per cent, up from 3.66 per cent a year earlier. However, the bank's provision for possible credit losses totalled Dollars 315m, up from Dollars 200m in the same period of last year and Dollars 265m in the third quarter. Excluding Third World debt, net write-offs in the quarter were Dollars 309m, up from Dollars 240m last year. The increase included a Dollars 44m increase in US commercial write-offs and Dollars 18m in US consumer write-offs. The loan loss provision for the full year was Dollars 1.1bn, compared with Dollars 1.3bn in 1990, and the bank warned that in view of the depressed real estate market it was likely that 'the provision for possible credit losses will continue at the relatively high level recorded in 1991'. Fee and commission revenue totalled Dollars 436m, up from Dollars 417m a year before, while revenues from trading jumped from Dollars 20m to Dollars 101m. Other operating expenses totalled Dollars 986m, up from Dollars 960m in the fourth quarter of 1990, due mainly to the takeover of a group of banks in the state of Connecticut. Mr James McDermott, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette and Woods, commented: 'Their charge-offs are high but their expense control seems to be on track.' Fourth-quarter net income per share totalled 80 cents, compared with 93 cents a year ago, excluding the benefits of the 1990 property disposals which boosted the total to Dollars 1.32. For the full year, the bank reported net income of Dollars 520m, or Dollars 3.12 a share, compared with a loss of Dollars 334m, or Dollars 3.31 a share, in 1990.</p>

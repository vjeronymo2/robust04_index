			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Rustam Narzikulov report: "Yeltsin Feels an Urgent Need </F> for Chernomyrdin's Political Will"]    [Text] The president has sent a letter to Viktor  Chernomyrdin "outlining the methods of resolving" the nonpayment  problem. Initially the letter was just "a memo on the nonpayment  problem" to be addressed to Central Bank Chairman Viktor  Gerashchenko, which was later converted into a public message to  the head of government.    The change in the document's political status has an  exclusively political bottom line -- the president has to  demonstrate to society his profound understanding of the  economic situation and his concern over economic problems. It is  not a coincidence that ITAR-TASS ended its report on the letter  to the prime minister with a high-sounding passage: "Boris  Yeltsin is taking on the entire responsibility for the second  stage of reform, including the need to free the Russian economy  from enterprises that have no future prospects."    The quotation very appropriately points out that the mass  restructuring of money-losing enterprises -- in terms of its  consequences -- is on a par with the January 1992 price  liberalization and subsequent efforts by various governments to  stabilize the ruble. In this case, nonpayments are a very  simple but reliable indicator of a grave economic depression,  from which there is no other way out than to apply the procedure  of bankruptcies with the subsequent restructuring of an immense  number of businesses. So the president, who has fairly good  experts in his staff, meticulously listed altogether correct,  standard, and, hence, long well-known methods to resolve the  "nonpayment problem."    However, the first part of the above ITAR-TASS quotation --  unlike the second one -- is outright cunning by a most  experienced political player. The president, even unaware of  economic and legal nuances of the bankruptcy procedure, realizes  all too well the political hazard of bringing what is still  mostly state-owned property into "a healthy state" (the  president's expression -- R.N.).    But this is what a government has been envisioned for in the  Russian system of executive authority -- as a rule it is the  government, not the head of state, who puts unpopular decisions  into practice. If Boris Yeltsin really sees bankruptcies -- not  the "mutual cancellation of debts," government credits, and so  forth -- as the sole method to combat the crisis of sales, a  method that does not have any alternative, then the prime  minister is facing what may prove to be the most difficult time  in his government career. It is he, not the president, who will  bear responsibility for public displeasure with forced  bankruptcies.    Viktor Chernomyrdin's economic successes of the past four  months (the slowing down of inflation and the postponement of  new customs duties) are attributable exclusively to an  unorthodox and at the same time extremely efficient method of  "delayed decisions." How this invention could be applied to  bankruptcies is hard to imagine, because "delayed decisions" on  nonpayments are tantamount to the conservation of unviable  bankrupts. Given this situation, the prime minister alone can  save himself -- if he manages to find yet another unorthodox way  out of the political corner into which he has been pushed.</p>

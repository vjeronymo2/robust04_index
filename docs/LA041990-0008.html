			<p><P> April 19, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: FILLMORE;  </P> <P> SCHOOL BOARD OKS $3.2-MILLION PROJECT  </P> <P> The Fillmore Unified School District has approved spending $3.2 million to  build a gymnasium and outdoor covered patio on a site originally intended for a  junior high school.  </P> <P> Last November voters defeated an $8-million bond measure sponsored by the  district that would have provided funding for construction of the school at A  and 3rd streets in Fillmore.  </P> <P> Dist. Supt. Marlene Davis said that although the district needs a new school,  not just the facilities approved Tuesday, its hands are tied because of the  failed bond measure and the improbability of getting state funding.  </P> <P> "The bottom line is that we have $3.2 million and what we said to the architect  is, 'What can we build for $3.2 million?' " Davis said. "What we can build is a  gymnasium and a pavilion, and that is all."  </P> <P> Trustee Tom Spitler, the only one on the five-member board to vote against  spending the money, said he questions "whether we can really get much  educational value for a gymnasium and a locker room." Spitler said he would  rather hold on to the money until the school district could afford to build  "more educationally oriented facilities."  </P> <P> But Davis said that building a school would cost $10 million and that voters  are unlikely to approve another bond measure necessary to finance it, given the  defeat of the proposed bond in November.  </P> <P> Fillmore Junior High School Principal Mario Contini said the gym and patio,  which will be built on a part of the land at A and 3rd streets, will relieve  crowding at the school. Contini said his school uses Fillmore High School's  cafeteria, library, gymnasium and other facilities. JOEL BRAND  </P></p>

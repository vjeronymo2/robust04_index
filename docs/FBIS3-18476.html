			<p>Language: <F P=105> Finnish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Finland has reached an agreement with the  European Union [EU] on conditions of membership. It is said the  breakthrough in Brussels took place after Finland received, at  the last moment, a concession from the EU which secures  Finland's markets from disturbances caused by some imported  foodstuffs. Finland also managed to receive extra concessions  from EU countries in agriculture. The Finnish negotiators,  Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto and Foreign Trade Minister  Pertti Salolainen, have just held an international news  conference in Brussels. In their news conference they said they  are very satisfied with the reached conclusion.    Our reporter Pirjo Auvinen also attended the news  conference.  It is said that the result of the negotiations is clear in its  main features. Do you have more information on the main points  of the agreement?    [Auvinen] In its main features the agreement is very similar  to the one that has been under negotiation during these two  ministerial meetings. Finland will have to give up its goal of  having EU price levels introduced in phases, according to the  ACA [expansion unknown] model. The European Union did not agree  to that, and producer prices have to be lowered to the EU level  from the first day of membership. However, the Union has moved  a little close to Finland because during the first four  transitional years the Union will compensate us with about 3  billion Finnish markkas of the estimated costs.    In regional policy, there was a new element in these  negotiations, the so-called level-six subsidies; Finland has  agreed to that. It includes the five areas that were put  forward for the level-one subsidies; in addition the areas were  extended during the last seconds of the negotiations.    [Announcer] What areas are now included, then?    [Auvinen] In quickly glancing at this Finnish-language  version, which was just given to us, I see that for Finland the  areas included are: Lapland, the Kuusamo area, Kainuu [northern  areas], Northern Karelia [eastern Finland], Southern Savo  [central Finland], and some poor areas connected with these  provinces. Immediately I notice that Southern Ostrobothnia  [western central Finland] is missing, an area which Finland was  advocating very strongly.    [Announcer] I see.    [Auvinen] In agriculture, there were concessions on  structural transition periods, which range from five to seven  years. The so-called agricultural subsidies for mountainous  areas covers 85 percent of Finland's arable lands. It is not  the full 100 percent Finland wanted to have. The subsidies for  northern agriculture and the subsidies paid by the Finnish tax  payers can also in the future only be paid for the areas north  of Tampere [town in southern central Finland]. [passage omitted]    [Announcer] Did I understand correctly that southern Finland  lies outside these subsidies?    [Auvinen] The entire area of southern Finland does not come  under this national subsidy, either. The European Union did not  agree to that. It maintained its principle that a whole country  can not come under any one subsidy. It has not budged on that.  [passage omitted]    The ministers admitted at the news conference that maybe the  weaknesses that are caused by the climate in Finland, or the  difficulties in farming, never became quite clear to all  countries of the Union. The ministers are of the opinion that  the package of subsidies now reached is complicated and a bit  too complex; it could have been clearer.    [Announcer] That is clear, but we have heard here that some  details are still being polished. What would these be?    [Auvinen] They were not quite clear at the news conference,  but what was clear was that they are apparently technical  revisions or comparisons. [Passage omitted]    [Announcer] The Finnish Government is also currently  expecting information on the contents of the agreement, and it  will discuss the result of the negotiations tonight. The  Central Union of Agricultural Producers, MTK, does not want to  comment on the result of the negotiations in any way tonight, it  has announced. The MTK will announce its viewpoint after a  meeting of its board of directors tomorrow.</p>

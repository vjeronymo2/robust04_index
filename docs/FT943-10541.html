			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Tesco/Wm Low Three weeks ago the board of William Low, advised by Barings, recommended its shareholders accept an offer from Tesco of 225p a share which it thought was 'fair and reasonable'. Yesterday it became clear that Tesco thought the price to be very reasonable indeed since it is now prepared to offer 60 per cent more. There is no question that the strategy adopted by William Low and Barings has been spectacularly successful at realising value for shareholders. But a few questions still remain. The William Low camp insist that by declaring it fair and reasonable they were not suggesting that shareholders could not hope for more. All they wanted to convey was that, without any bid, the shares would be worth less than 225p. Since the shares were trading at 169p before the offer most shareholders could probably work that out for themselves. As for the recommendation that was demanded by Tesco, William Low acceded to it as a mere formality in order to get the bidding going. Still, if advisers want to maintain their credibility, they should think carefully about letting their names be used too casually.</p>

			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Usdaw chiefs back reforms by Labour THE CAMPAIGN in the Labour party to introduce a one-member-one-vote (Omov) system for the selection of parliamentary candidates achieved a significant breakthrough when leaders of the shopworkers' union Usdaw came out in favour. This arrangement would replace the present system in which unions exercise a direct vote in candidate selection through local electoral colleges alongside individual members. Usdaw's executive will recommend the change at the union's annual conference in April. If carried, it will strengthen the chances of success for the reform at Labour's conference in the autumn. The change of union policy on reform will please Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, who also favours the reform and in the next few months will increase pressure on other unions to support it. 'The outcome on Omov may now be too close to call,' said one union official. It is estimated that more than 1.5m union votes are committed to the new system. It will be opposed by the Transport and General Workers, the General, Municipal and Boilermakers and the Public Employees, which together account formore than 2m votes. The union block vote will fall from 89 per cent to 70 per cent at this year's Labour conference, however, and the constituency parties are expected to back the system.</p>

[passage omitted]    Two UN peacekeepers -- a Frenchman and a Canadian -- drove  to  the site in a jeep and offered to help, but were jostled by an  angry crowd and forced to leave, a French photographer at the  scene said. But other peacekeepers took seven of the wounded to  the UN hospital in an armoured troop transport vehicle.    The attack came a day after mortar shells killed eight  civilians, including two girls aged eight and nine, in the  suburb of Dobrinja as they were queueing for food aid.    The new British commander of UN forces in Bosnia, Lieutenant  General Michael Rose, said Saturday an investigation had shown  "with certainty" that Bosnian Serbs were responsible for  Friday's attack. [passage omitted]    Bosnian Serb military commander General Manojlo Milanovic  protested to the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) about  "accusations from the Moslem authorities that the Serb army had  committed the massacre" on Friday, the Bosian Serb news agency  SNRA reported.    Milanovic threatened to block relief convoys travelling  across Serb-held territory from Monday unless a joint commission  was set up by Sunday morning, including Serb, Moslem and UN  experts, to investigate Saturday's massacre.    Bosnian Vice-President Ejup Ganic meanwhile blamed the Serbs  and called for "an end to the arms embargo (against Bosnian  authorities) so they can defend themselves." [passage omitted]</p>

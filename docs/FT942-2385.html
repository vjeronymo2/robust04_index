			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Tories back away from EU funds row Conservative Euro-sceptics are preparing to back away from confrontation over a bill increasing Britain's contribution to the European Union's budget for fear that renewed wrangling could smooth Labour's path to government. But ministers may be unable to exploit the situation to secure Commons approval for the measure before MPs begin the summer recess next month, as they had originally intended. This is because the bill remains blocked in the EU Council of Ministers. Meanwhile, in an indication that the government still faces a struggle to get its way on some European issues, Tory rightwingers yesterday intensified their calls for Britain to veto the appointment of Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian prime minister, as president of the European Commission. The calls were led by Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, who said Britain should reject the nomination of Mr Dehaene and threaten to veto it. Earlier this month, Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, hinted that the government was not prepared to veto Mr Dehaene's appointment if its preferred candidate - Sir Leon Brittan - did not gain enough support among other EU states. Tory Euro-sceptics yesterday played down the prospects of a Maastricht-style rebellion over the bill giving force to changes in the European Union's funding system. They warned of a 'sea-change' in attitudes brought about by growing concern in Conservative ranks that Labour was making itself 'electable'. But Sir Teddy Taylor, a leading Euro-sceptic, made it clear that he would oppose the bill, which will lift Britain's contribution to the EU budget in line with the agreement reached at Edinburgh in December 1992. Sir Teddy, the MP for Southend East, said he found the idea of passing a bill to give the EU more money 'literally unbelievable'. According to the Treasury, Britain's net payments to the EU are set to more than double to Pounds 2.8bn in the year beginning April 1995 from Pounds 1.3bn in 1994-95. The government said last month that the bill was being blocked by Italy in the Council of Ministers, making it increasingly unlikely that it can be presented to MPs before the Commons summer recess starts next month. If ministers are unable to introduce the measure until the autumn, it will raise the prospect that next year's legislative timetable will have a pronounced European flavour, which would be unwelcome to the government. A bill to permit the enlargement of the EU is also expected to be included in the timetable.</p>

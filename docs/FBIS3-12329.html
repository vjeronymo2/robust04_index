			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat at PLO </F> headquarters in Tunis by Shadiyah Riyad in Cairo in the "Talking  Newspaper" program--live]    [Text] [Riyad] Your Excellency, the Palestinians' security  under the Israeli occupation is Israel's responsibility. Do you  believe that Israel is incapable of providing security for the  Palestinians or is it not interested in their security?    ['Arafat] I would like to say something very important.  There is full involvement by the Israeli Army in the crime that  took place today, that massacre which was carried out in the  Ibrahimi Mosque. The army had been an accomplice in many earlier  incidents. When I say this I do not say it lightly. It is  known that the Israelis have sequestered Sarah's Grotto, which  was Abraham's wife's, and turned it into a synagogue. This was  done inside the mosque. Therefore, there is constant guard at  the entrances of the mosque and around it. That is why they  cannot say that any settler could sneak in with his weapon. The  settlers entered behind an army captain and under cover of the  Israeli army. They committed their crime, which has resulted so  far in 65 martyrs and 256 wounded people. The army covered the  getaway of these criminals. It also opened fire on the people;  six martyrs fell and about 22 persons were wounded as a result.  The number of martyrs in Hebron has not been counted as yet.  In addition, the army is staging confrontations in all areas;  in Gaza, Ramallah, Qalandiyah, Bethlehem, Qalqilyah, and  Nabulus, where dozens of people have been martyred or been  wounded since morning. There is complicity between the army  [pauses] it might not be in the army. But a considerable sector  of the army command was accomplice to this crime, earlier  crimes, and the crimes that are taking place throughout the  country at present. I would like to remind you, Sister Shadiyah,  that I clearly pointed a few weeks ago to the army's involvement  in distributing and selling weapons in the territories. They  think that by the time they withdraw, chaos will prevail among  our people, our folk, and our strugglers. This tells us that  there is an integrated plan which the Israeli Army is carrying  out. Let people near and far realize the dimensions of this  crime.    [Riyad] Mr. President, there is an uproar among the  Palestinian population, some of whom call for suspending the  negotiations because the atmosphere is not appropriate. Do you  think that this ugly massacre will lead to the suspension of  negotiations or will it dictate continuing and speeding up these  negotiations?    ['Arafat] No doubt, we must understand that the main  objective of these criminals is to strike at the peace process.  We are now studying all possibilities.    [Riyad] Does this require a revision of the concepts  governing the peace process and does this development dictate  new issues?    ['Arafat] No doubt, it will have extremely negative effects  on the entire peace process. I contacted all the international  sides, the co-sponsors of the peace conference, the permanent  members of the UN Security Council, and the EU members, all the  European states, the nonaligned states, the Islamic states, the  Arab states, the African states, and all our friends in the  world. I also asked that an immediate and emergency session of  the UN Security Council be convened. We demand international  protection following the actions with the collusion of the  Israeli army and the armed settlers as part of an integrated  plan. Therefore, we urge all the honest people of our friends  and all our Arab and Muslim brothers, all the peace-loving  people, and all the freedom-loving people to immediately help us  by putting an end to these massacres and to swiftly introduce  international protection for our people inside our occupied  territories.    [Riyad] Mr. President, this brings me to a question about  your expectations concerning the reaction of the international  community. If I rightly recall, in 1990 there was another  massacre in the al-Aqasa mosque in which dozens were killed, but  maybe not as many as those killed today. At that time, the  matter was referred to the UN Security Council, which condemned  Israel. The Palestinians then called for international  security, but Israel refused and the international community  could not enforce such protection. Do you think that this  scenario will be repeated, or are things different now?    ['Arafat] Everything has become exposed. As of today, the  world, the world leaders, and the world officials should  shoulder their international responsibilities, humanitarian  responsibilities, political responsibilities, and moral  responsibilities. They must give their word. Will they leave  Israel and its army to carry out acts of belligerency against  the Palestinian people, against our faithful, our worshipers,  women, children, and people? Will they leave this belligerency  without control? I say that the entire world must know that our  people will not kneel down. This is the people of martyrs. We  are all martyrs-in-waiting. People far and near must understand  these words.    [Riyad] Thank you sir.    ['Arafat] May God bless you.    [Riyad] Thank you very much.    ['Arafat] Thank you.</p>

			<p>940415 FT  15 APR 94 / Venezuela tax go-ahead The Venezuelan Senate gave final approval yesterday to special legislation empowering President Rafael Caldera to decree new tax laws. The tax package is one of the last elements in the economic stabilisation programme tabled by Mr Caldera after he took office in February. He now has 30 days to decree a new 10 per cent levy on wholesale sales, to raise the income tax ceiling for corporations and individuals from 30 to 34 per cent, to impose a new tax of 10 to 30 per cent on luxuries, and to bring in a controversial tax on debit transactions at banks. The special powers were proposed by Democratic Action, a main opposition party. The government expects the new levies to raise the equivalent of about Dollars 3.5bn (Pounds 2.4bn) in revenue and to help cut the fiscal dificit this year to 1.5 to 2 per cent of GDP, from a projected deficit of 6 to 8 per cent.</p>

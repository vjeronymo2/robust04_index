DPR&hyph;31 and DPR&hyph;41, issued to the licensee for operation of the Turkey Point Plant, Units 3 and 4, located in Dade County, Florida. Notice of Consideration of Issuance of this amendment was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on March 30, 1994 (59 FR 14889). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose of the licensee's amendment request was to revise the Technical Specification (TS) to delete the frequencies from the audits performed under the cognizance of the Company Nuclear Review Board (CNRB) and remove the audit of the emergency and security plans and implementing procedures from TS. The audits would be performed at the frequency specified in the FPL Topical Quality Assurance Report (TQAR). Some audits would be performed less frequently (biennial rather than annual in most cases). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NRC staff has concluded that the portion of the licensee's request regarding audits of the Fire Protection Program cannot be granted for the reasons stated in letter dated October 26, 1994.

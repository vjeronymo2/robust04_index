			<p>BFN     [Text] Referring to the historic Israeli-PLO Agreement, the  Foreign Ministry, representing the European Union [EU], stressed  that the EU warmly welcomes the signing of the agreement and  particularly respects the two sides' decisiveness not to allow  extremist elements to raise obstacles in front of peace. The EU  is calling on all sides to play full and positive roles on the  bilateral and multilateral levels of the peace agreement.    New Democracy hailed the agreement between Israel and the  Palestinians, describing it as a historic and courageous step  toward a permanent peace settlement in the region.    Political Spring expressed hope that the courageous message  of peace will find imitators in every distressed corner of the  world, especially Bosnia-Herzegovina.    A Coalition of the Left and Progress statement notes that  the  dream of past decades is now becoming a reality and the lengthy  struggles of the heroic Palestinian people are justified.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Sophism of Hypocrite" -- KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, June 20 (KCNA) -- The Japanese Foreign  Minister, Koji Kakizawa, claimed that Japan must be a permanent  member of the United Nations Security Council with veto power  and if it got a permanent seat, it would be active to "reflect  the view of the Asian region and small nations."    Commenting on this, NODONG SINMUN today views his remarks as  a sophism of a hypocrite and an obtrusive rigmarole looking down  upon Asian countries and small nations.    The analyst says:    His remarks that Japan will represent the view of the Asian  region means that it wants to become "the leader" of Asia. Down  through history, Japan has regarded Asia as the target of its  aggression and looting. It has considered it to be natural.  Such a thinking-pattern has been inherited by the present  Japanese Government authorities.    In actuality, Japan is seeking the repetition of its past  policy of aggression. This is well illustrated by the Japanese  Government's position on the nuclear issue of the Korean  peninsula. Japan is watching for a chance of reinvasion, while  going ahead with the preparation of "emergency security  legislative arrangements" aimed at sending its Armed Forces to  the Korean peninsula under the pretext of "countering the  fictitious nuclear issue" of the DPRK. Japan's military  aggression on Korea will be the first step toward its comeback  to Asia for realising its old dream of "the greater East Asia  coprosperity sphere."    How can such a country represent the will of the Asian  countries? Japan's expression of wish to represent the Asian  nations is an insult to the Asian nations and people.    The Japanese Government expressed the view that "the use of  nuclear weapons is not contrary to the international law,"  openly favoring the use of nuclear weapons. This indicates that  Japan will make no scruple of plunging developing and small  nations into a nuclear holocaust to dominate and plunder them.    The Japanese reactionaries must give up their impudent  ambition and honestly liquidate its past crimes first of all.</p>

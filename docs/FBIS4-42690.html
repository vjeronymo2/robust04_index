			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [EC Document No. DOC/IP/94/481: "Humanitarian Aid for the </F> Population of Yemen"]    [Text] The European Commission has decided to grant  emergency humanitarian aid totalling ECU200,000 to the victims  of the civil war in Yemen.    The aid, which will be delivered by Medecins sans  Frontieres-France [Doctors Without Borders], will  include:     -  Caring for the wounded on both sides;    -  Providing  essential care to displaced persons from the south who have  grouped together in Aden and Lahej (a town 40 km north of Aden).  They are living in schools and other public buildings under  extremely precarious conditions;    -  Assistance to the 7,000 Somali  refugees in the Al Kawd camp in the territory of Abyan, located  to the east of Aden and support to move them away from the front  lines as soon as possible.     The aid is being organized out of two centers. The Aden team  will provide first aid material to the civilian hospitals and  will monitor the hygiene conditions of displaced persons. The  Sana'a team will supply the hospitals in Sana'a and the  territories of Ibb and Taez. It will also be responsible for  moving the refugee camp.    The aid from ECHO, the humanitarian office of the European  Community, will be used to buy, transport, and distribute  medical kits and pharmaceuticals, to buy materials on site for  displaced persons and refugees, and to help defray the cost of  sending expatriate staff there for one month.    Since the beginning of the confrontations between the forces  of the north and south on 5 May, the Commission has granted  ECU500,000 in emergency aid.</p>

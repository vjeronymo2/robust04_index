			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Books: A religion of Good rather than God - AC Grayling on the Murdoch philosophy METAPHYSICS AS A GUIDE TO MORALS by Iris Murdoch Chatto &amp; Windus Pounds 20, 520 pages A CHARACTER in one of Iris Murdoch's novels believes, under the influence of a drug, that he is experiencing 'the Good Absolute'. To the friend at his bedside he looks like a 'wide-browed, huge-eyed god'. Murdoch has always disclaimed philosophical ambitions for her fiction, but in the light of her new book - a large, elaborate and visionary philosophical essay - these images suddenly appear telling. For Murdoch believes in the existence of an objective Good which touches our lives at every moment, making urgent demands upon us; and in this richly stimulating work she endeavours to justify that belief and to explain what it means. Her central contention is that morality is not peripheral, as now too often thought, but essential to our lives. To grasp its importance we must attend to every detail of our inner experience, and we will see that each is morally charged. We inhabit the familiar yet mysterious continuum of the present; it is what is nearest to us, and 'it matters what kind of place it is'. Living rightly, Murdoch says, is a matter of directing our moral energies by loving the Good, which is 'absolute and unique, a magnetic focus'. Fundamentally people just know the difference between good and evil, but the task is to help them respond to that knowledge. Aesthetic and spiritual considerations richly play their part in this. Murdoch argues that religion  -a sense of the sacred, and of there being exigent claims upon us from an objective authority - is vital here: but what is required is a religion not of gods or God but of Good: 'Good is the reality of which God is the dream'. The thinkers to whom Murdoch constantly recurs in meditating these themes include Simone Weil, Wittgenstein, Schopenhauer and Kant. But the book's dominating philosophical presence is Plato. Indeed her thesis is Platonist in an almost literal sense, in that the central characters of the ethical drama are the solitary private self, with its implicit sense of 'something higher', and the Form of the Good, the fundamental reality of our world. The two enemies of belief in the existence of a moral absolute are, Murdoch argues, science and structuralism (by which she means Derrida's views). Both enterprises analyse, deconstruct, unpiece the wholeness of things. Science seeks only facts, and excludes value; structuralism premisses the merely relativistic nature of truth. Both therefore marginalise morality. The view that objective Goodness exists, that it is both pervasive and authoritative in our lives, and that we all know what it is, is familiar enough in philosophy. Even if it were untrue many would wish it otherwise. So Murdoch is not offering a new theory. But it is a surprise and a refreshment to have this view defended again, and in such an original, sensitive and powerful way. Yet the old doubts remain: can such a view be argued, or can it at most be urged? Murdoch recognises that her view cannot be stated in knock-down argument form. It has to be exhibited from different angles to be made persuasive. Like other contemporary philosophers Murdoch holds that ethical theory must trawl widely for its materials, in literature and elsewhere, and that it best proceeds by seeking patterns and perspectives through which, at last, one can understand the nature and authority of moral reality. Accordingly her method is to discuss art, comedy, imagination, religion, and a number of other themes, in what at first seem to be discontinuous and internally rambling essays, but which in the end, by accumulation, build the case for her view. Indeed it is only in the closing chapters that the picture begins to clarify fully. The book's appearance of rambling is, however, exacerbated by two things. First, Murdoch seems to have given up trying to turn a mass of notes into a treatise, and to have simply transcribed the notes instead, complete with parenthetical reminders to herself and frequent over-long quotations. Secondly, there is no signposting; the book begins abruptly and strolls on by itself, with readers rarely being told what conclusions are being sought or how the discussion will proceed. Murdoch's commitments emerge at irregular intervals, but it is only in the short chapters at the end - doubtless written when she at last began to marshal the growing luxuriance of notes into a book - that direct statements of her theses appear. In its form the book resembles a novel; reading a novel is like taking a night-train to an unknown destination, which is part of the fun. But discursive literature has a different etiquette. One hopes that Murdoch has not deterred too many readers by leaving them mapless in this way, for this is a significant book, lambent with insights, intelligence, and profound concern, and it hugely rewards careful reading.</p>

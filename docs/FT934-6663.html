			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Pub staff get 'on the house' exams The relative ability of bar staff to pull a decent pint is going to be reflected in their pay for the first time at one of the largest chains of public houses. Whitbread Inns, part of Whitbread, the food and drinks group, is to link pay to qualifications in a new training package to be launched in its 1,600 pubs in the new year. The qualifications will be based on the competence-based National Vocational Qualifications for the catering and hospitality industry. Skills to be gained include serving food and drink. Employers generally have been reluctant to pay their employees extra for the attainment of work-based NVQs and the move by Whitbread will give staff an incentive to improve their training. Whitbread Inns said the minimum rate for a new entrant to a pub's bar staff was Pounds 3.01 an hour. Employees successfully taking part in the three stage proficiency scheme would increase their minium rate by more than 70p a hour.</p>

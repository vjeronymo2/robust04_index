			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / World Stock Markets: London's Seaq seeks to raise its profile in global equity market THE recently launched Eurotrack indices were designed with two objectives in mind: to promote the international equity market that has grown up in London around Seaq International and to service the needs of the international professional investors. Global investing is now a reality. Overseas investment in foreign shares has risen from around Dollars 300bn worldwide in 1985 to more than Dollars 1,500bn in 1989. Today, more than one transaction in every seven in world equity markets has a foreign investor on the other side. Europe, excluding the UK, accounts for roughly one third of all cross-border transactions made worldwide and, within Europe's equity markets, one in every three transactions now involves a foreign investor. The global market is dominated by large international institutional investors such as pension and life assurance funds. These professional investors demand liquidity  - London is sometimes the only market able to give it to them. The average bargain size for the Frankfurt Stock Exchange is Dollars 50,000; on the Paris exchange it is estimated at less than Dollars 25,000, compared with an estimated average bargain size of Dollars 275,000 for Seaq International. In 1990, turnover in international stocks on Seaq International amounted to more than Dollars 525bn, with more than Dollars 330bn or almost two thirds of that turnover in continental European stocks. For 1990 as a whole, Seaq trading in international shares almost equalled turnover in domestic UK and Irish shares traded on the London Stock Exchange. In the same year, Seaq accounted for more than half of the total cross-exchange business (shares traded in a market that is foreign to the nationality of a share) worldwide. London now trades more than a quarter of the volume of the Paris exchange in French shares, around half of the local volume in the Netherlands, 19 per cent of local Spanish volume and more than 12 per cent of the local volume on the German exchanges. Firm quotes (securities, usually blue chips, on which there are committed prices) on Seaq usually account for less than half of the total capitalisation (or market value) of the home markets. There has been a healthy growth in firm quotes in the first quarter of 1991, particularly in France, Germany and Italy. Eurotrack is expected to encourage further the concentration of trading in Europe's leading international shares in London. The three FT-SE indices  - the FT-SE 100 (UK), FT-SE Eurotrack 100 (Europe excluding UK) and FT-SE Eurotrack 200 (all Europe)  - make it possible for investors to construct and trade their European portfolios on a single market, avoiding the vagaries, delays and cost of trading across many markets. Early indications are that investors will use the FT-SE index of 200 leading European stocks either as a benchmark for Europe or as a tradeable sub-set of the European component of the existing world indices, such as the FT-Actuaries World Indices, Morgan Stanley Capital Index or the Salomon-Russell indices. The launch of the Eurotrack indices has already attracted much interest from the derivative exchanges. Liffe is to begin trading a future on the FT-SE Eurotrack 100 next month and the London Traded Options Market is due to launch an option on the same index. Similarly, the Chicago Board of Options Exchange, the world's largest options market, intends to trade options on both Eurotrack indices and the FT-SE 100. There has already been a spate of over-the-counter warrants, and US exchanges are expected to begin to trade Eurotrack warrants on their market floors before long. Such derivatives are an essential prerequisite for the investment techniques now used by today's international professional investor. Eurotrack derivatives will reduce the need for the investor to mix and match several local market indices to hedge a European portfolio. Instead, professional investors will be able to use the Eurotrack futures and options to hedge their total European portfolios, or they might use the Eurotrack indices together with other indices to create their own synthetic global and European derivative combinations to suit their own investment objectives. At least one leading insurance fund in the UK is already using the FT-SE Eurotrack 100, together with the US Standard &amp; Poor's 500 and Japanese Topix/Nikkei 225 indices to manage its global (excluding the UK) portfolio. Another strategy suggested by the derivative experts is to use the FT-SE Eurotrack 100 in combination with local market index contracts based, for example, on the DAX in Germany, CAC 40 in France, and SMI in Switzerland, to tilt the fund's exposure towards or away from a particular country within continental Europe. A close correlation exists between the country components of Eurotrack and the European country benchmark indices; the German, French and Swiss components, with correlations of 0.99, are expected to be the most popular synthetic derivative combinations. In the future, professional investors are expected to use the Eurotrack indices to create and manage the indexed core of their European portfolios, and to use other structured products and active strategies to take advantage of known inefficiencies in the market or trends such as the small companies effect. The International Stock Exchange in London, therefore, believes that the Eurotrack concept and the family of associated products offer convenience, liquidity and simplicity to existing and prospective investors in European stock markets. This greater visibility is expected to be good news for the Seaq International market. Michael Howell is research director at Salomon Brothers International and was involved in setting up the Eurotrack indices. Mark Makepeace is business development manager for indices at the London Stock Exchange.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Seaq International Share of European Turnover (January to December  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Country         Seaq Int'l   Turnover as   Firm quotes                    turnover     % of home     as % of                    (bn dollars) market home   market France                61.2        26.7         46.9 Germany              125.0        12.2         34.5 Italy                 19.2        11.7         35.4 Netherlands           41.4        50.3         76.6 Spain                 11.3        18.7         30.0 Switzerland           31.3        25.8         43.0  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

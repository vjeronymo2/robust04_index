			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Brazil angered by WTO choice Brazil yesterday reacted angrily to reports that Argentina, theoretically a close ally, had backed Mexican President Carlos Salinas to head the World Trade Organisation instead of the Brazilian candidate, Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero. Mr Domingo Cavallo, Argentine economy minister, was asked to cancel a visit to Brazil which had been scheduled for later this month. Brazil's Foreign Ministry said the cancellation was not a reprisal, but the visit was considered 'not opportune' because of Brazil's preparations to introduce a new currency. However, a ministry spokesman said the Argentine action had caused 'great discomfort' and had been viewed as 'diplomatically inelegant'. The row started on Thursday night at the close of the fourth Iberian-American meeting in Colombia. Mr Salinas won the meeting's informal backing to head the WTO, which is to succeed the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade next year. He was helped by Argentine President Carlos Menem who privately proposed Mr Salinas as the Latin American candidate. This led to allegations from Brazil, whose President Itamar Franco had left the meeting early to attend a funeral, that Argentina had waited for the Brazilian delegation to leave before raising the subject. The informal backing of the Iberian-American group will strengthen Mr Salinas' candidature, and only one candidate from Latin America is expected to be considered by the new body. But Brazil insisted yesterday that Mr Ricupero, the only person to have officially put his name forward, remained a 'viable' candidate. The row between Brazil and Argentina comes at a difficult time. The two countries have until the end of this month to finalise a common external tariff for the planned Mercosur common market, due to take effect on January 1. Brazilian officials are in Buenos Aires this week discussing the tariff rates.</p>

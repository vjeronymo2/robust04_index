			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev -- To the question from a UNIAN correspondent:  "What will you do if you find out that you have been elected  president of Ukraine or that you have gone through to the second  round of the election," Leonid Kuchma, a candidate for president  of Ukraine, noted: "If I am not elected, I would cross myself  with happiness." In the event of his election he would take his  first steps in the economy because "the point from which one  should begin is to bring order to one's home."    With regard to possible cooperation with Vitaliy Masol,  prime  minister of Ukraine, if he is elected president, Leonid Kuchma  replied that this is a question to which he does not yet know  the answer at the moment.</p>

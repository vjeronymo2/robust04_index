Marwan Kanafani said PLO-Israeli discussions set to resume  in  Cairo next week "do not constitute a resumption of the  negotiations."    Earlier an aide to Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin told  AFP the negotiations on autonomy in the Gaza Strip and West Bank  town of Jericho would resume in Cairo Tuesday, exactly one month  after the talks were suspended over the Hebron massacre.    Kanafani said the PLO was continuing its contacts with all  concerned parties, including the United States, Russia and  Norway, to obtain answers to demands made by the PLO in the wake  of the Hebron massacre.    A resumption of the autonomy talks "depends on positive and  practical answers which the Israelis must provide," concerning  implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 904, which  allowed for protection of Palestinians in the occupied  territories.    After the massacre the PLO called for an armed international  protection force to be deployed in the territories, the  disarming of Jewish settlers and dismantling of certain  flashpoint settlements.    The Israeli official, declining to be named, said  negotiators  General Amnon Shahak and the director general of the foreign  ministry, Uri Savir, had reported to Rabin on "the progress made  in the Egyptian capital."    "We will go back to Cairo on Tuesday and this time we will  be  able to conclude," Shahak, the deputy chief-of-staff, said on  his return after two days of talks on boosting security for the  Palestinians of Hebron.    The PLO broke off the autonomy talks after a Jewish settler  massacred 30 Palestinian worshippers in a mosque of the West  Bank town of Hebron on February 25.    In Cairo, chief PLO negotiator Nabil Sha'th said the two  sides had drawn up a draft accord on the deployment of  international observers and a Palestinian police force for  Hebron.    But he did not confirm the autonomy talks would resume,  saying only that the negotiators would meet again in the  Egyptian capital on Tuesday for further talks on security for  Hebron.    Sha'th said the draft accord would be submitted to PLO and  Israeli leaders. "Important progress was achieved during  negotiations in the last two days in Cairo but there are certain  points to clear up," he cautioned.    Israeli radio said that if the security measures for Hebron  were finalized early next week, the negotiations to launch  autonomy in the Gaza Strip and West Bank town of Jericho would  resume "immediately."</p>

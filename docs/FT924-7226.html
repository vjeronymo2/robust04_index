			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Mercury to launch new service MERCURY Communications will today launch a new service offering business customers the benefits of a private telecommunications network without having to lease and maintain their own infrastructure. Mercury said its 'virtual private network' service would be up to 30 per cent cheaper than conventional private networks. Call charges would also be cheaper than using the public network. It said it expected the market for such services to exceed Pounds 500m in three to four years. British Telecommunications, Mercury's larger rival, already offers a similar service. But unlike BT's service, which is charged on a flat-rate basis, Mercury's charges will vary according to the amount the service is used.</p>

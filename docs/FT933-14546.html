			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / Companies act to split top roles, report shows BRITISH companies are bowing to pressure from shareholders and their peers to split the roles of chairman and chief executive. According to a survey of companies published yesterday by Korn/Ferry, the headhunting firm, only 15 per cent still combine the two roles, compared with 25 per cent a year ago. The division of the two functions was one of the most important recommendations in the recent Cadbury report on corporate governance, which said that so much power should not be vested in a single individual. Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, said yesterday: 'The Cadbury report has reached parts that other recommendations on corporate governances haven't reached.' He said the scale of the shift was remarkable for a single year. The report, which takes a detailed look at the structure, pay and concerns of British boards, is likely to add to public concern that some directors are paying themselves too much. It shows that the largest pay rises last year went to those who were already most handsomely rewarded. The upper quartile - those earning more than Pounds 360,000 in companies with turnovers of more than Pounds 1bn and more than Pounds 250,000 in companies with turnovers of more than Pounds 250m - on average received pay increases last year of 16 per cent. The bottom quartile received no increase. The range in pay settlements for directors overall was unusually wide, with one in six taking a pay cut. On average the increases were between 4 per cent and 8 per cent. Mr Davies singled out as disappointing figures showing that 5 per cent of larger companies and 24 per cent of smaller ones did not have an audit committee, as recommended in the Cadbury report. He described as 'depressing' the finding that the position of women had not improved since the survey a year ago. There were only 11 women directors out of nearly 1,000 directors. Only two were executive directors and both of those were from smaller companies. 'At the top level there is still a network into which women do not fit,' said Mr Davies. 'Companies say we do not want token women, we only want board level, but that argument is self-defeating.' The composition of boards is also changing. Nearly 80 per cent of larger listed companies have between six and 11 directors on the board, with the balance becoming more evenly divided between executive and non-executive directors. Mr Michael Brandon, author of the report, said: 'All of these factors suggest that boards have become more businesslike. There are sure signs that the City has gone off the cult of the superstar whose decisions go through largely unchallenged.' Boards of Directors Study UK. Korn/Ferry International, 071-930 4334.

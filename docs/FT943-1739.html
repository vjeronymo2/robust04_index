			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / International Company News: French lift results at Italcementi Income from Ciments Francais and other foreign operations helped Italcementi, Italy's biggest cement group, to overcome the continued depression on its domestic market in the first half of this year. Italcementi, which bought Ciments Francais in 1992, has unveiled consolidated first-half profits, before amortisation, provisions and taxes, of L306.5bn (Dollars 196.47m) compared with L218.5bn in the first half of 1993. But the company's Italian arm was hit by the continued stagnation in the Italian construction market. Production fell by 12.6 per cent, faster than the average drop in demand. Overall income of the group, which is headed by the industrialist Mr Giampiero Pesenti, was L2,545bn compared with L2,556bn last time, but the Italian group registered a drop in turnover to L529.4bn, compared with L614.1bn in the first six months of 1993. Fondiaria, the Italian insurance company indirectly controlled by the Ferruzzi holding company, returned to net profit in the first half of 1994 due to extraordinary gains on the sale of investments and property. After tax, the company recorded a profit of L14bn for the first half, compared with a loss of L121bn in the equivalent period. Investment gains amounted to L64.2bn, compared with L9.6bn, and property sales realised a profit of L22bn. No property was sold in the first half of 1993. Premium income also increased during the period, and the reduction of debts to L748bn on June 30, compared with more than L1,000bn a year earlier, also helped. Total group company premiums increased to L3,167bn, up 2.3 per cent.</p>

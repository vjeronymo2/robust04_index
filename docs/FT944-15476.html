			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / International Company News: IBM simplifies range of PC product lines International Business Machines has simplified its personal computer product lines, reducing them from nine ranges to four in an attempt to cut costs and reduce confusion among buyers. The new 'branding strategy' is the latest move by IBM to try to regain momentum in the fiercely competitive PC market. It has fallen from first place in the US PC market in 1993 to fourth place behind Compaq Computer, Apple and Packard Bell in the first half of this year. The company also launched several new desktop and notebook models and cut prices on others. 'The PC industry has done a brilliant job of innovation and technology,' said Mr G. Richard Thoman, IBM senior vice-president and group executive, who took charge of IBM's PC operations in January. 'But in the process, we have lost touch with the majority of customers who are all dazed and confused by the complexity in the technology, the array of choices, and the level of support.' The new IBM brand names are IBM PC, IBM PC Server, ThinkPad (for notebook computers) and Aptiva (for consumer products). The consolidation does away with lines including the PS/1, PS/2 and Value Point, and reduces the number of designs IBM will manufacture. The new approach marks the return of the 'IBM PC' brand that for a decade was the hallmark of PC industry standards. IBM will back its new branding strategy with an aggressive television and print advertising campaign, Mr Thoman said. Streamlining the product lines is part of a broad restructuring effort, he added. Over the past 10 months he has consolidated IBM PC operations and sharply cut its workforce. The changes have been 'difficult, but necessary', said Mr Thoman. 'We are now in a position to respond better and faster to the customer and become the long-term leader in the PC industry.' The company also introduced new products under these brands, including a family of commercial desktops - the IBM PC 700 and IBM PC 300 Series. A software suite called IBM PC EasyTools, including applications and programs that help to set up a new computer, will be loaded on the entire IBM PC series. Also introduced were a new PC Server and new multimedia notebook computers. Prices were cut by up to 17 per cent on some existing ThinkPad and PS/2 models.</p>

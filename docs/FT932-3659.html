			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Property: Wherever there's a polo field . . . - In spite of the recession horsey pursuits are still popular, as Gerald Cadogan discovers HORSES are expensive luxuries, needing swathes of grass, special food, shelter, tack, medicine, and clothes for themselves and their riders. And when Lloyd's losses loom large, giving up equine pastimes is an obvious economy. Yet, horsey pursuits retain their popularity in Britain, in spite of the economic downturn. And while prices for properties with stabling have suffered in the recession, like everything else, the market for them will survive so long as people race, hunt, jump, trek, play polo or drive carriages. It is not just Britons who are keen are such properties. Earlier this year, Strutt &amp; Parker sold the late Jim Joel's stud at Childwick, Bedfordshire, to the Swiss connections of the Portugese owner of The Fellow (the beaten favourite in the Cheltenham Gold Cup). And John D. Wood reports that a potential Italian buyer has just viewed Sylvandene in Surrey the top-notch equestrian centre of David and Marion Mould. The guide price is Pounds 450,000. Several stud farms are on the market. Christopher Stephenson, a specialist in racing and bloodstock properties, and Woolley &amp; Wallis are offering Woodminton Farm for around Pounds 750,000. This is under the downs west of Salisbury, Wiltshire, and where Major and Mrs RB Kennard bred Cadeaux Genereux and Smarten Up. Stephenson also offers Jevington Place near Eastbourne, Sussex, at the same price (down from an original Pounds 1.1m) with its acreage reduced slightly. Its smart yards with 45 loose boxes, barns in Sussex-style knapped flint and brick, paddocks with post-and-rail fencing, and position next to the church make an attractive proposition. Another in Sussex is Burleigh Farm, near East Grinstead and Gatwick airport. It has 21 acres and an immaculate and practical six-box yard, offered by Jackson-Stops at Pounds 675,000. Outside Newbury, Berkshire, Savills is selling the Woolton House estate with its Woolton House stud. Among its winners is Supreme Court, which took the first King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot in the Festival of Britain year (1951) in the colours of Vera and Thomas Lilley (of Lilley and Skinner). After he died, she married Colonel Roger Hue-Williams. Theirs was the heyday of the stud in the 1960s and 1970s. The whole is priced at Pounds 3.25m, or is available in lots. The big house (in one lot) needs work but would make an excellent base for racing and entertaining, as it did for the Hue-Williams. The dilapidated subsidiary house that goes with the stable yard (another lot) is an 1880s villa - a potential delight if re-done completely. Neither house is listed, which will make it easier to alter them, and both have fine trees screening them from the road. In Cheshire, the Rookery Park stud near Nantwich is on offer from Lamont (with Stephenson) at more than Pounds 1m; it has 29 loose boxes and six-furlong gallops. The house was built in 1987 in half-timbered style. In Hertfordshire, Mullucks Wells (with The London Office) has the Blakeware stud with 18 boxes and a listed Victorian Gothic building that used to be a coach house. Price: around Pounds 695,000. For Pounds 100,000 less (from Bedford and Savills) is the Tally Ho stud near Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk. That is the price for the peach-painted Regency house and garden, but the yard with 15 boxes is a further Pounds 185,000. Idover House near Malmesbury, Wiltshire, with two yards and paddocks, makes a good base for hunting with the Beaufort. Lane Fox offers it at around Pounds 495,000. Near Cheltenham, the same agent has Rossley Manor, an old Cotswold house with stable yard, grazing, and holiday cottages that produced an income of Pounds 25,000 last year. The price without the cottages is around Pounds 750,000. In the same region, Hamptons is selling Little Park at Wootten Bassett in Wiltshire; this boasts a cross-country course built in 1990 by the same people who constructed the course at Badminton. The house is 17th-18th century, with 262 acres, and the price (over Pounds 975,000) includes a first-rate shoot. In Hertfordshire, Coltsfoot Farm at Datchworth has six paddocks and 30 boxes, for around Pounds 495,000 from Strutt &amp; Parker. It could make a good base for the growing practice of do-it-yourself liveries, where the box is let out at a typical rate of Pounds 20 a week. If your dream is a training yard, Lambourn on the Berkshire Downs runs Newmarket a close second. The gallops are owned privately and maintained superbly. Trainers pay Pounds 52.50 a month plus VAT per horse - racing on the flat - to use them. In the centre of the village, equestrian property specialist Pilgrim Bond offers Bourne House, a 41-box 'town yard' (last used by Nicky Henderson) for Pounds 350,000. On the edge of Upper Lambourn, Lane Fox has Charlie Brooks's yard at Uplands, with 58 boxes, for around Pounds 850,000. If dressage is what matters, Addington Manor near Winslow (of Great Train Robbery fame) in Buckinghamshire is where Lady Inchcape has created the top dressage centre in the UK. It is new on the market (from Strutt &amp; Parker and Savills) at over Pounds 2.75m. Another 'seriously rich' property in the county is Great Hundridge Manor near Great Missenden, a Grade II house with 628 acres, 28 boxes and 10 paddocks for around Pounds 3.5m from Knight Frank &amp; Rutley. But the top priority for many people is a paddock for the children's ponies. Keep your eye on the local newspaper but expect to pay considerably more than the usual prices for agricultural land - even Pounds 3,000-5,000 an acre. Renting on a grazing agreement is likely to be Pounds 50-Pounds 60 an acre.

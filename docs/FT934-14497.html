			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / London heads EC fares league LONDON COMMUTERS pay the highest fares of any capital city in the European Community, a survey by the Association of London Authorities revealed yesterday. Calculated on 10 six-mile (10km) trips, Londoners pay Pounds 15.65 per week. Brussels was the second most expensive city at Pounds 12.95, having moved up from last year's sixth place. Athens remains the cheapest at Pounds 2.12. Ms Jane Reeves, of the association, said: 'European visitors are astonished at the cost of public transport in London. Our commuters pay by far the highest fares in Europe and the government's policy of above-inflation increases each year means that Londoners will continue to pay the most.' London Transport accepted the association's findings. It said London fares were so high because of government policy of meeting most transport costs from fares, rather than general taxation. It said: 'London's transport services are by no means the most expensive in Europe. However, we work on a subsidy of less than 10 per cent of running costs. In other cities, subsidies can be as high as 70 per cent or 80 per cent.' It added that Stockholm, outside the EC, was the only European capital where transport fares rivalled London's.

			<p><P> October 10, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: MIAMI EXPECTED TO JOIN THE BIG EAST  </P> <P> The University of Miami, seeking basketball credibility to go with its football  reputation, is considered likely to accept an invitation to join the Big East  Conference.  </P> <P> The school's board of trustees will decide the matter today.  </P> <P> "I believe accepting an invitation to the Big East would be very much in  order," board member David Kraslow said. "I favor it very strongly for a whole  variety of reasons."  </P> <P> Joining the high-profile conference could mean the salvation of a basketball  program that has averaged fewer than 3,000 fans a game since Miami resumed  playing the sport in 1985 after a 15-year hiatus. Also, income from basketball,  along with conference revenue sharing, would reduce financial pressure on the  football program.  </P></p>

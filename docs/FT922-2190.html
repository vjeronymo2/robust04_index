			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Computerised trading system for Budapest SE THE BUDAPEST Stock Exchange has become the first in eastern Europe to order a computerised trading system, reflecting its ambitions of becoming an international centre for securities trading in the region. With Ecu1.9m provided by the European Community, the exchange is buying a trading system based on Nordex, the cross-border market developed for Swedish and Norwegian shares. The exchange currently has only a handful of shares and bonds listed. But privatisation in the coming months is expected to add rapidly to this list. Also, the exchange hopes that rapid computerisation will increase investor confidence that it is running an efficient and transparent stock market. The exchange intends to continue with its open outcry market, and add an electronic limit order book allowing investors' orders to be completed automatically. Besides the limit order book, the automation will involve equipping 55 booths for brokers, and two trading posts with price display screens.</p>

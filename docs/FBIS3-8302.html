In a statement made to TANJUG, Popovic specified that, since  the outbreak of war in former Yugoslavia, between 17,000 and  20,000 refugees from the breakaway Yugoslav Republics of  Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia have transited through Yugoslavia  (Serbia/Montenegro) on their way to Germany as well as to  America, Asia and Australia.    "German authorities appear to see the refugees in only one  light--viz, as Yugoslavs," Popovic said.    Germany has announced its intention to begin expelling the  refugees from Serbia and Montenegro in three days' time. The  local press estimates that the decision will affect about  200,000 refugees, mainly Bosnian Serbs and ethnic Albanians from  the Serbian province of Kosovo-Metohija -- holders of Yugoslav  passports.    The Serbian commissioner for refugees believes that this  unprecedented move on the part of Germany is meant to provoke a  reaction from Yugoslavia which would then be taken as a pretext  to continue to pursue the present anti-Yugoslav policy.    The German weekly DER SPIEGEL estimates there are about  350,000 refugees from former Yugoslavia in Germany, 230,000 of  whom have come from Serbia and Montenegro. This number  obviously includes Serbs from Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia who  have refused to renounce their Yugoslav citizenship at the time  of the disintegration of the Balkan federation and take the  citizenship of the newly-proclaimed states.</p>

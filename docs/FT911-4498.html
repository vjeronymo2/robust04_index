			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / Japanese money growth slows JAPAN'S money supply rose by just 4.9 per cent in March compared with the same month last year, the lowest monthly rate of increase on record. The decline in growth, from a peak of 13 per cent less than a year ago, highlights the fierceness of the Bank of Japan's determination to squeeze excess money out of the economy. In the first three months of 1991, the money supply has shrunk by 1.2 per cent, on an annualised basis. Mr Yasushi Mieno, the central bank governor, insists that he will keep his grip on credit for at least the time being - despite hopes among investors of an imminent cut in the Official Discount Rate. In a speech on Wednesday, Mr Mieno said that there had been a slight slowdown in the economy. 'But that is only natural and even desirable in consideration of the past tight monetary policy.' Mr Russell Jones, an economist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the securities company, says that the central bank could cut interest rates with little fear of inflation. But other factors, including the recent weakness of the yen against the US dollar, might give Mr Mieno pause for thought. Aside from the exchange rate, the central bank is concerned about upward pressure on wages from labour shortages, consumer price inflation and a possible resurgence in speculative investment in land if interest rates are cut too soon.</p>

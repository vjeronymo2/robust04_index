			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Sutherland injects new urgency into Gatt talks THE director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, Mr Peter Sutherland, called yesterday for greater urgency in negotiations on concluding the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks by December 15. Addressing the top-level trade negotiations committee, he said the work done in the past two weeks on opening markets for goods and services had been useful. But he urged countries to come forward quickly with more concessions. Mr Sutherland later told reporters: 'On balance I am more optimistic (than two weeks ago) but there are serious risks to the Round.' The global trade talks in Geneva restarted earlier this month after the US, the EC, Japan and Canada agreed a deal to reduce or eliminate tariffs on 18 categories of goods. However, the latest talks have underscored the gaps in that accord and the problems caused by interlinking different elements of the package. Many developing countries complained yesterday that the principle of more favourable treatment for poorer nations was being disregarded, and made clear that market access concessions from them on goods and services would depend on offers from industrialised nations on commodities, agricultural goods and textiles. A number of countries, both rich and poor, are also tying tariff cuts and market-opening measures for services to changes in the Uruguay Round draft rules package, especially on agriculture and textiles. Mr Sutherland called on countries to break the logjam by making conditional offers, and said he would be holding consultations on how best to uphold the objective of more favourable treatment for developing nations. Warning of the 'vast amount' of work needed before the rules could be finalised, he urged countries 'to exercise maximum self-restraint' in proposing changes to the draft text, drawn up in December 1991. The TNC has agreed a tight negotiating schedule in its drive to achieve 'substantial and concrete progress' in the market access talks by mid-October. The negotiating group on goods will meet on October 15 for 'stocktaking', aimed at completing detailed draft tariff schedules a month later. Revised services offers have been requested by September 1, paving the way for intensive negotiations on liberalisation commitments. Mr Sutherland plans immediate consultations on technical aspects of the rules package, including dispute settlement and the proposed Multilateral Trade Organisation.</p>

			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / Farm Reform in Europe: Europe aims to sweep path to Uruguay Round - One thorny problem may have been removed in the world trade talks, but plenty more are waiting to take its place MRS CARLA HILLS, US trade representative, was in no doubt two weeks ago about the state of the Uruguay Round of talks on world trade liberalisation. 'The problem is agriculture: that is the problem that has to be swept away - and the Europeans have the broom. We have to wait until they have a consensus as to how they are going to treat with it.' Today it seems the EC has delivered at least the consensus she needs. Whether the package of CAP reforms provides an adequate broom for the agriculture problem to be swept away has yet to be made clear. Much will depend on meetings in Washington next week between US and EC negotiators. Even if the point has indeed been reached where the agriculture problem can be swept away, a new and unhappy reality may then be brought back into focus: the dispute between the US and the EC is but one of the obstacles blocking a Uruguay Round agreement. If this were now to be cleared away, problems over market access agreements, and trade in services could yet bring the agreement to grief. Disagreement over farm trade reforms have blocked progress towards a successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round since the Brussels summit at the end of 1990. Crisis was triggered there not by the US, but by Argentina, which led a walk-out of farm exporters from the developing world in protest at EC farm trade policies. They were angered not just because Europe remains largely closed to their exports, but because the EC practice of dumping subsidised farm products on to world markets had ruined food prices, undermining their main source of export earnings. For the past 18 months, all attempts to seal a Uruguay Round agreement have foundered on EC resistance to farm reform. Hopes that had been revived in December by publication of a draft agreement were quickly dashed in January by EC rejection of its proposals for liberalisation of farm trade. Most intractable were demands for a 20 per cent cut in domestic farm price supports; for a 24 per cent cut in the volume of subsidised exports, and a 36 per cent cut in their value; and for compensation payments to farmers to be made in a form that did not encourage higher production. In addition, the EC was demanding that the US cut its sales to Europe of cheap grain substitutes, and that it agree a 'peace clause' preventing US companies from using US courts to enforce demands linked with any part of the farm trade agreement. As far as farm price supports are concerned, Mr Ray MacSharry's proposals appear to provide an important breakthrough: at 29 per cent, the cuts will be deeper, and will be made earlier, than the draft Uruguay Round agreement had demanded. Whether this augurs well for the unresolved issue of export subsidies is unclear. It is nevertheless worth recalling that a senior US trade negotiator said just two weeks ago: 'Whether it is export subsidies or rebalancing or internal supports, it comes down to the price of grain.' In Geneva yesterday, where Uruguay Round negotiators have faced mounting frustration in recent months over the lack of headway, the proposed CAP reforms received a cautious welcome. Officials from the Cairns Group of 14 agricultural exporting countries said they were cautiously optimistic that the deal would inject 'fresh spirit' into the talks. But they needed to see how the projected reform would translate into changes in the EC's bargaining position over farm trade, and how it would affect products other than cereals, such as dairy and sugar. Cairns officials said the broad thrust of the reform appeared to be on the right lines. As long as the rest of the package broadly followed the agreement on cereals, it provided an assurance that the EC would make sizeable cuts in farm subsidies, including export subsidies, and curb over-production. Officials added that yesterday's agreement meant that, for the first time, the EC would be speaking with one voice on farm trade reform. Set against the advantage for US negotiators that an EC position will at last be clear when they meet in Washington next week is the disadvantage that the EC now has very little negotiating flexibility. Having sweated blood to wring this package of compromises out of EC member states, Mr MacSharry has little scope to win further compromises. If the package falls short of US and Cairns group demands, then further concessions will almost certainly have to come from them rather than the EC. A Uruguay Round farm trade breakthrough would immediately put Japan, Korea and Canada into the hot seat. All three are under fierce pressure to open their markets to farm products. All have been 'hiding' behind the US-EC conflict in recent months. For the Japanese government, concessions will be impossible until upper house elections late in July. For Korea, embarrassment is even more acute. The government faces elections at the end of this year, and could suffer gravely in important farm communities if it opens its market to rice imports before then. Canada's prime minister, Mr Brian Mulroney, has the unhappy position of being the least popular democratically elected leader in the world. He has just 15 per cent endorsement from voters in recent polls. With elections in 1993, concessions on opening up Canada's dairy market may cost him still more votes. 'It is unquestionably a time of reckoning,' said one EC observer.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         WORLD WHEAT PRODUCTION                            (million tonnes)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                    1986      1987     1988     1989     1990#    1991+  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- EC                 72.1      71.5     74.6     79.2     80.4     84.8 US                 56.9      57.4     49.3     55.4     74.5     53.9 World             537.6     514.6    506.1    545.8    598.9    543.4  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- #Estimated  +Forecast  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                           WORLD WHEAT TRADE                            (million tonnes)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                    86/87     87/88    88/89    89/90    90/91    91/92+  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- EC                  15.3      14.7     20.0     19.7     18.3     21.2 US                  28.2      43.2     37.8     33.5     28.3     34.0 World               90.3     105.7     96.4     96.7     91.7    103.6  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- +Forecast  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                           WORLD WHEAT STOCKS                        Estimated total carryover                            (million tonnes)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                     1986      1987     1988     1989     1990     1991  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Main exporters      84.9      83.6     60.3     39.7     38.7     53.5 Others              75.2      83.3     82.3     75.2     81.3     87.9 World              160.0     167.2    142.6    114.9    120.0    141.4  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: FAO  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          OECD BEEF PRODUCTION                           (thousand tonnes)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                     1987      1988     1989     1990     1991  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- EC                 8,020     7,617    7,360    7,539    7,646 US                10,805    10,860   10,636   10,464   10,557 OECD              23,534    23,372   22,335   22,466   22,713  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         OECD BEEF CONSUMPTION                           (thousand tonnes)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                     1987      1988     1989     1990     1991  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- EC                 7,500     7,620    7,400    7,000    7,200 US                11,628    11,613   11,196   11,048   11,098 OECD              22,861    23,091   22,010   21,509   21,793  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                           OECD BEEF SURPLUS                           (thousand tonnes)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                     1987      1988     1989     1990     1991  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- EC                   520        -3      -40      539      446 US                  -823      -753     -560     -584     -541 OECD                 674       281      325      958      920  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: OECD  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

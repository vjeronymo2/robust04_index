			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / UK Gilts: Borrowing requirement is hard to ignore IT IS hard for the gilt-edged market to ignore the government's heavy borrowing requirement. Another gilt auction looms, and market practitioners are well aware they could see the issuance of as much as Pounds 1bn of gilt-edged stock per week in the next financial year. The impending flood of stock has left many in the market wondering just who will buy these gilts. For many institutional investors, gilts represent only a small proportion of their total assets, and few seem to be contemplating a drastic change in strategy. Mr David Shaw, bond director at Legal &amp; General Investments, points out that 'on valuation grounds, the (UK) equity market looks on the dear side both intrinsically and against overseas equities. Only against cash and gilts do (UK shares) look cheap. That cannot be good news for the government broker who needs to sell Pounds 50bn of gilts in 1993-1994'. Mr Shaw estimates that in 1992, only 24 per cent of UK institutions' cash flow went into buying gilts, but he warns that 'the apparent burden on the UK investment institutions is forecast to rise from Pounds 9bn in 1992 to Pounds 28bn in 1993 . . . this would represent a diversion of 70 per cent of their expected cash inflow for next year into gilts'. To put that in perspective, he says, 'even during the funding crisis of the middle 1970s those institutions' net new acquisition of gilts never exceeded 50 per cent of new cash inflows'. So far, there have been few signs that UK institutions are contemplating a dramatic shift in overall investment strategy. Those which are willing to boost exposure to fixed income investments are focusing more on the European and US bond markets rather than the UK government bond market. Norwich Union says it expects the returns from the bond and equity markets to be lower this year than in the 1980s. Its with-profits fund is invested: 55 per cent in equities, split with 40 per cent in the UK and 15 per cent internationally; 25 per cent in fixed income, split 17 per cent in the UK and 8 per cent in other bond markets; and 20 per cent in property. Norwich Union says it is not planning to boost its exposure to the gilt market, given the high returns it expects from the European and US bond markets. Other UK institutions tend to have a lower exposure to the gilt-edged market than Norwich Union. Rothschild Asset Management has emphasised its commitment to the international fixed income markets in view of the looming recessions and poor prospects for equities under such economic conditions. But it has also stressed its preference for overseas bonds rather than UK government debt. The UK government's heavy funding programme is seen as a serious concern, with the result that RAM feels more comfortable about prospects for UK equities (given the hope of an economic recovery in the UK and the positive effects of the sterling devaluation on corporate profits) than for the gilt market. It says the UK pension funds under management are invested with about 60 per cent of the money in UK equities, 3-4 per cent in conventional gilts, 2 per cent in index-linked gilts, 7 per cent in overseas bonds, and 22 per cent in non-UK equities. Mr John Cozens, assistant director of Prudential Portfolio Managers, says PPM is underweight in gilts with less than 5 per cent of the total sterling investments in UK government bonds, while it is slightly overweight in UK equities, with about 85 per cent of sterling investments in UK shares. These attitudes are hardly encouraging for the gilt market. Mr Shaw of L&amp;G concludes that the government may have to reduce its funding requirement considerably using various means including a temporary suspension of the full funding rule and higher taxes.</p>

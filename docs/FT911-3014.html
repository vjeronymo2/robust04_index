			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (4): Three treats for children CHILDREN'S SAVINGS were boosted by three measures in the Budget. Friendly Societies - offering tax-exempt funds which pay out a tax-free lump sum after 10 years - will now be allowed to take business from people under the age of 18. As the Budget also raised the total amount any individual can put into a society each year to Pounds 200 (this time last year it was Pounds 100), this branch of the investment industry has been given a significant shot in the arm. Experts expect a surge of baby bonds,allowing parents and grandparents to putmoney into a child's account, to hit the market once the Finance Bill has received royal assent, which should happen towards the end of July. Meanwhile, National Savings will launch a new product aimed at youngsters - a tax-free children's bonus bond. Maximum investment will be Pounds 1,000 per child, in units of Pounds 25 each, and there will be a substantial bonus paid after five years. A final measure to benefit all families with children, irrespective of their income, was the rise in child benefit. From October, families will receive an extra Pounds 1 for their first child, and an extra 25p for each subsequent one. Mr Lamont promised that in future the benefit would be indexed.</p>

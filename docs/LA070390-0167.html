			<p><P> July 3, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> NORSE OIL CREWS STAY ON STRIKE  </P> <P> Wildcat strikes by workers on Norway's North Sea oil and gas platforms cut most  production today in defiance of a back-to-work order by the government.  </P> <P> News of the illegal strike sent crude oil prices higher in New York.  </P> <P> About 1,000 workers refused to pump oil and gas and blockaded helicopter  landing pads at offshore platforms to stop non-strikers from landing.  </P> <P> "We have illegal strikes at all our platforms, all the helicopter decks are  closed," said Morten Woldsdal, spokesman for state oil firm Statoil.  </P></p>

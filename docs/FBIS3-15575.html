			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Turkmenistan has increased its daily gas supplies to  Georgia from 8 Mn to 9.5 Mn cubic meters, the Gruzgas Department  told INTERFAX.    This is due to the recently reached agreement between the  two  countries' leaders. Turkmenistan has also agreed to a deferment  in the payment of the Georgian $150 Mn debt.    Meanwhile, the production of electricity by the Georgian  hydro-power plants has almost doubled due to a rise in the river  levels. Georgia generates 16 Mn kilowatt hours of electricity  daily. Another 2 Mn kilowatt hours arrive daily from Azerbaijan.    The Georgian hydro-power plants are expected to start  working  at full load in the second half of March, which will put most of  the local enterprises back into operation.</p>

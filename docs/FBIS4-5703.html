			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 13 (KCNA) -- Now, South Korean  people deem it a greatest honour and national pride to have the  dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il as chairman of the National  Defence Commission [NDC] of the Democratic People's Republic of  Korea.    A worker Choe residing in Kwanak district, Seoul, upon  hearing the news that Comrade Kim Chong-il was elected chairman  of the DPRK Defence National Commission, said: "We workers  regard his election as chairman of the National Defence  Commission as our supreme honour and extend our sincere  congratulations to him.    "It is only too natural that Marshal Kim Chong-il, supreme  commander of the Korean People's Army (KPA), who has  strengthened the KPA founded by President Kim Il-song, a great  military genius, into an invincible revolutionary Army, was  elected chairman of the National Defence Commission."    Pak Il-chon, a company clerk residing in Yongdungpho  District, Seoul, said:    "The dear leader Kim Chong-il is a great military genius  with  rare wisdom and grit.    "His election as NDC chairman of the DPRK is an expression  of unquestioned trust and respect of the people in the North for  him.    "Now that he has been elected NDC chairman the North will in  the future exalt its might further to the world militarily as  well as in political and economic aspects. This is, indeed, a  happy event for us people in South Korea who look up to the  North as a beacon of hope."    A student Yi Kwang-un at Pusan National University said:    "As it is guided by the dear leader Kim Chong-il, a great  statesman and outstanding brilliant commander, the North could  demonstrate its might in bold confrontation with the United  States which has become the 'only superpower'.    "It is natural that the dear leader, such an outstanding  strategist and famous general, was elected chairman of the  National Defence Commission.    "I feel reassured when I think that he is protecting the  life  and destiny not only of the people in the North but of our  entire fellow countrymen."    A professor surnamed Kim at Seoul National University said:    "General Kim Chong-il is, indeed, a famous general and  distinguished statesman endowed with both literary and military  accomplishments to shoulder the future of the nation.    "His election as chairman of the DPRK National Defence  Commission is a reflection of the will of the people in the  North, an event worthy of special record in the nation's  history, a great auspicious event and the highest honour of our  nation."</p>

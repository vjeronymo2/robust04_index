			<p><P> April 15, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> REFLECTIONS: 'IT GIVES ME A SENSE OF GOOD FEELING, LIKE I'M DOING SOMETHING  WORTHWHILE, CREATING SOMETHING NOT EVERYONE CAN DO'  </P> <P> For many, Easter egg decorating brings to mind a simple process: dipping  hard-boiled eggs into different colors of vegetable dye. But, when Lucy Sermak  was a teen-ager, she learned of a 2,000-year-old technique that combines the  batik artistry, symbolism and folklore of the Ukraine. It's called pysanky.  </P> <P>  In pysanky, derived from the word pysate, which means "to write," designs are  written on the egg with wax and the entire egg is dipped in dyes. A single egg  can take anywhere from 30 minutes to eight hours to complete, depending on the  intricacy of the design.  </P> <P>  Sermak, now 47 and living in San Carlos, has admittedly become addicted to the  craft. She has gone from creating a dozen pysanky eggs during Easter for her  family and friends to making 100 to 150 a year.  </P> <P>  She has had her crafts on display at libraries, at the Ukrainian Festival in  San Diego and at the Southern California Exposition, or Del Mar Fair, where she  has won several awards. She also teaches classes in the ethnic craft for  children and adults with her partner, Cynthia Barbat. Sermak spoke with Times  staff writer Terry Rather and was photographed by Teresa Tamura.  </P> <P> Pysanky egg decorating started out as an Easter tradition because the egg was a  symbol of life. And, of course, spring is also the start of new life after  winter. A long time ago, young girls would make them in secret to surprise  their boyfriends. They would make a special egg, which would take weeks of  labor, and present it to their boyfriends as an Easter morning gift.  </P> <P> The basic technique used is the batik method, using melted beeswax and a stylus  with a tiny hole which lets the wax flow onto the egg, forming the design. You  dip the raw egg in a light color. Another portion of the design is covered with  wax, which will preserve the design.  </P> <P> The egg is then dipped into the next color, which is darker. You always work  light colors to dark, until the design is completed. The wax is then removed by  melting the wax and wiping it with a soft cloth and the entire design is  revealed.  </P> <P> These eggs are not to be eaten. They are strictly ornamental. Traditionally,  they just left the eggs inside, and they just dried out naturally through the  years. Today, eggs are more fragile, so most times the eggs are blown out.  </P> <P> The eggs were originally created with certain meanings. For instance, a horse  or a deer was put on as a symbol of wealth and prosperity; wheat designs of  harvesting, drops of tears of Mary and, of course, crosses are symbols of  Christianity. Most have lines going all the way around the egg in some way,  which represents everlasting life.  </P> <P> My favorite symbol is the star because it's so fun to draw. There are so many  variations to it. You can do probably 50 of them, and each one will be  different. I also love the geometric designs. It's not as traditional, but  blues and purple are my favorite colors. Purple means royalty; it's a symbol of  richness. Blue represents the sky.  </P> <P> A friend of mine taught me how to do the eggs when I was 17. She showed me how  to make a simplified version of pysanky. About 11 years later, my husband and I  joined a Byzantine church, which is Greek-Catholic. The priest showed us how to  do these. After I picked up these styles, it took hold of me, and I fell in  love with decorating eggs.  </P> <P> Pysanky egg decorating brings out the creative side of me because I have this  need to create. It's also a means of relaxation. I have my "egg table" set in  one corner in my house. I can work whenever and however long I please, and it  doesn't interfere with anything (my kids) do.  </P> <P> Sometimes I don't want to go to bed at 1 or 2 o'clock in the morning because I  get so involved and enthusiastic in the designs I'm making. It satisfies that  creative urge I have. I see a picture I like, and I try to see if I can put  that on the egg. It gives me a sense of good feeling, like I'm doing something  worthwhile, creating something not everyone can do.  </P> <P> Spring is the rebirth of nature. We don't feel it so much here as they do in  other parts of the country because the weather is so warm and we don't feel  this closed-in, dark feeling. The winter can get so severe and cold and all of  a sudden the snow melts and grass starts sprouting, and you just feel this  surge of energy and this rebirth of life. I try to keep some of that feeling  when I'm doing the eggs.  </P> <P> I think I'm hooked. Egg decorating is something I am doing more in winter and  spring, not just for Easter. I enjoy creating, and I end up giving so many  away. There's always a new design I want to try. I also like to share the  craft.  </P> <P> Sharing something you enjoy doing and having someone else generate the same  enthusiasm gives you a good feeling inside. It's something wonderful and  beautiful.  </P></p>

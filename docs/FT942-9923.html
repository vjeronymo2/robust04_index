			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / Scott may call further witnesses Lord Justice Scott may call more witnesses to give evidence to the inquiry into the exporting of defence-related equipment to Iraq, officials indicated yesterday, John Mason writes. The scheduled public hearings, which have lasted just over a year, ended yesterday when officials from Customs and Excise completed giving evidence. Their presence had already caused the inquiry to extend its original April 1 deadline. Even if more witnesses are called, Lord Justice Scott is expected to keep to his original timetable and complete his draft report by July, with the final report due to be published by December. Provisional criticisms will be sent to those concerned in August. Mr Christopher Muttukumaru, the inquiry secretary, warned yesterday that leaks of these criticisms 'would not be helpful' since the exercise was intended to ensure the report was fair to witnesses.</p>

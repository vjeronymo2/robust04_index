			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / Economy to recover soon says Lamont: Chancellor predicts significant strengthening of UK position as inflation falls MR Norman Lamont, the chancellor, said yesterday that economic recovery in Britain was 'round the corner'. The UK was making 'excellent progress' in cutting inflation, Mr Lamont told journalists just after addressing the policy-making interim committee of the International Monetary Fund in Washington. 'I think we are going to get inflation down to a level not so far removed from the strongest countries in Europe within a very short period of time,' he said. It would result in a very significant strengthening of the UK position. Mr Lamont said he could not be precise about the timing of the recovery, although he thought it would be around the end of the second quarter. In the UK, as elsewhere, lower inflation and lower interest rates would be powerful forces for recovery. The 'key lesson of the late 1980s' was that firm control over inflation was a condition for sustained growth. He repeated the government's position that it would cut interest rates when reduced inflation created the flexibility for such action. He dismissed as 'imaginative' a Sunday newspaper report that interest rates would be cut again next month. 'I have made no commitment on cutting rates,' he said. The chancellor's upbeat assessment of Britain's economic prospects came only days before Thursday's local elections and after a period in which economic news has been almost universally bad. He said that in the coming months the official statistics - particularly those for lagging indicators such as employment and investment - would continue providing evidence of past weakness in the economy. But he stressed the importance of distinguishing such backward looking indicators from forward looking signs that were now emerging. These, he said, had begun to show a marked improvement in consumer and business confidence. Mr Lamont admitted that unemployment would continue to rise during this year, although the extent would depend on the level of wage settlements and on the effectiveness of the government's labour market reforms. He said that such reforms could have made the labour market more flexible and there were indications that wage increases might be moderating. The chancellor's comments follow the optimism expressed recently by Mr John Major about an economic recovery on the horizon - although even some Conservative MPs at Westminster are not yet convinced. The steep rises in unemployment are increasingly dominating clashes between the main parties at Westminster, with the government's handling of the economy high on the political agenda. Last night, Mr Gordon Brown, Labour's trade and industry spokesman, said: 'Far from turning the corner, all the evidence is that unemployment will rise fast during spring and the summer, that manufacturing investment will fall by 17 per cent this year and our industrial capacity is now being eroded in the run up to 1992.' Mr Lamont, addressing the IMF committee on trade issues, said that removing barriers had a vital part to play in giving the world a non-inflationary boost. A resumption of negotiations in the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks was 'vital' and it was 'particularly important' that there should be less protection of agriculture in the European Community and elsewhere. He also called on the world's industrialised nations to apply existing rules under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) and to operate export credit schemes on an unsubsidised basis. The provision of export credit that could not be fully repaid had involved a large sacrifice by taxpayers in creditor countries, the chancellor said. It constituted a form of government interference in free trade that was damaging to growth and efficiency in developed and developing countries alike. Mr Lamont said the UK would charge higher premiums for taking on risk and be more cautious about extending guarantees. He hoped other countries would do the same. M&amp;S job cuts, Page 22</p>

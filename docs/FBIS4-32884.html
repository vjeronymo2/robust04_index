			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Lima, 27 May (EFE) -- The video showing Shining  Path [SL] leader Abimael Guzman, which police seized in 1991,  still is delivering mortal blows to the movement: It has helped  capture the current Shining Path "No. 2" leader, Felipe Tenorio.    In February 1991, police found a videocassette in a Lima  house supposedly used as Guzman's hideout. In the video, Guzman  could be seen imitating the dance shown in the film "Zorba, the  Greek."    The video also showed the main Shining Path leaders close to  Guzman. Among them was Felipe Tenorio Barbaran, aka "Augusto,"  who also was dancing with his chief, "President Gonzalo" as he  is addressed by his followers.    On 26 May, Peruvian police publicly presented Tenorio to the  country dressed in the striped uniform worn by arrested  terrorists. Tenorio probably will be sentenced to life  imprisonment.    According to police, "Augusto" was the "No. 2" man in the  new  Central Committee of the Peruvian Communist Party, which is the  real name of the Maoist terrorist group. "Augusto" is second  only to Oscar Ramirez Durand, aka "Feliciano," who is the  current Shining Path leader.    "Feliciano" has been trying to reorganize the terrorist  group  since Abimael Guzman's arrest in Lima on 12 September 1992.  Guzman was later sentenced to life imprisonment.    "Feliciano" has bluntly rejected Guzman's proposal to the  Peruvian Government calling for a peace accord as well as his  orders to suspend attacks and murders. [passage omitted]    As in Guzman's case, "Augusto" was arrested at a house in  Los  Olivos District, Lima, without having the chance to shoot a  single shot. He had been one of terrorists most wanted by the  National Counterterrorism Directorate (Dincote). [passage  omitted]</p>

			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / This Week: Film/Video Environmental soundness has come to cinema in recent years. When in doubt, recycle. This week should have seen the opening in London of Natural Born Killers, but the censor decided it was too mad, bad, violent and new. So we have revivals of My Fair Lady (no serial murders) and Bicycle Thieves (non-violent vehicle robbery), plus a lavish, no-brain Hollywood adventure drawn from a 1930s radio serial: The Shadow has Alec Baldwin prowling through New York in a hat and cape, righting wrongs and fighting wicked Orientals. Racist subtext? Never mind. At least there is no real blood or real emotion being spilled over your popcorn. On video, too, Aunt Edna may breathe freely in the run-up to Christmas. We have a mixture of innocent fun - Cool Runnings, with its comedy re-enactment of the Jamaican bobsleigh team's glory week at the 1988 Olympics - and erratic attempts at grown-up entertainment. The Paper, starring Michael Keaton and Glenn Close, is a brisk, caustic newspaper yarn after The Front Page. And Ken Loach's blithe comedy of working-class doldrums, Raining Stones, comes to the retail shelves. If you fancy a movie of that hit stage play about transvestite passion, M. Butterfly, you may not fancy it after seeing David Cronenberg's version. John Lone - mascara, kimono and rugger-player shoulders - makes a less than convincing woman, and Jeremy Irons as the love-struck consul fades into the cod-Chinese scenery. The best place to be is once more the London Film Festival. The final week offers you two curious and wonderful tales of sex and soul-searching. From Canada, Atom Egoyan's Exotica (Wednesday) is a mazy mind-melodrama, shot in a nightclub resembling a human aquarium. And from Taiwan, Tsai Ming-liang's Vive L'Amour, the 1994 Venice Golden Lion winner, maroons two youths and a girl in an untenanted apartment and watches their fantasies singly and collectively explode. Dangerous and original movies. Happily, the censor exercises no sway over the LFF. So for two precious weeks each year grown-up moviegoers have a place to go and be grown-up.</p>

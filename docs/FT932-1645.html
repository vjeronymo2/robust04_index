			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Pakistan still seeks political peace after Sharif's return: Tensions which threaten democracy 'Due to present political crisis, progress is stalled, development is hampered, Pakistan is suffering.' SO SAYS a large front-page advertisement in a local newspaper, signed by 10 leading businessmen. The ad also lists 30 'important achievements' of Mr Nawaz Sharif, prime minister, with a caption which reads: 'No man has done so much in such a short time'. While supported by many in business, who are keen to see progress in his economic reform plans, the recently reinstated Mr Sharif is faced with equally passionate critics who claim his government has been corrupt and ineffective. The polarised environment that has resulted is perhaps the most important source of continuing political uncertainty in Pakistan, a country which has lived under martial law for more than half of its 46-year history. Mr Sharif and politicians loyal to him say publicly that they are in command after the supreme court's verdict last month, which overturned an earlier presidential order and restored the government. But the prime minister is facing strained relations with at least two of the country's four provinces. Tensions with President Ghulam Ishaq Khan have only just begun to recede, though no one knows if the two leaders will return to a normal working relationship. Mr Khan said last week he would welcome Mr Sharif if the prime minister came to visit him. Since the government's restoration four weeks ago, the two met only once and briefly, on the return of the corpses of Pakistani soldiers who were killed in Somalia. Mr Sharif and Ms Benazir Bhutto, the opposition leader. bitter foes for almost five years, have formed committees of aides in an attempt to resolve their differences. Both leaders have a stake in saving the democratic system, because their own futures will be determined by its future. But there are few signs of any imminent breakthrough. Ms Bhutto is demanding basic electoral reforms, formation of a broad-based 'national government' which includes the opposition, and fresh mid-term elections. 'Nothing short of a national government with fresh elections will get political stability. Otherwise, we'll have manipulations. Somebody will be up, somebody will be down,' said Ms Bhutto recently in support of her demands. One of her party MPs is expected to participate in a parliamentary committee set up over the weekend to recommend constitutional changes. Among those are certain to be proposals for repealing the controversial constitutional amendment which empowers the president to sack elected assemblies and call elections. Mr Sharif has so far shown few signs of giving ground. The cases of corruption against Ms Bhutto which were filed against her after her government's dismissal in August 1990, though never proved in court, have still not been withdrawn. In addition, the opposition claims that some of its supporters are still being persecuted. 'If the prime minister is not even prepared to pay the price of peanuts for initiating talks with the opposition, then I don't think we are going to get anywhere,' Ms Bhutto adds. Its also not clear how far Ms Bhutto is willing to compromise, especially after recent reports of a dent in her popularity following her party's decision to join the government of Mr Balakh Sher Mazari, the interim prime minister who briefly replaced Mr Sharif. In its efforts to seek political peace, the government feels encouraged that the other important actor in Pakistani politics, the army, has so far remained neutral. The defence budget was only raised by 1.9 per cent this year, far below inflation, which is officially estimated at around 10 per cent. That step has been widely seen as a sign that the government has some support from the army to undertake its economic reform policies. However, should there be, in the worst case, political deadlock, street demonstrations, and/or the refusal of the provinces to work with the centre, there could be an opportunity for troops to be called to take control of the situation. Mr Khan's term of office ends in November, and it is still unclear if he will seek a second term. The prime minister is believed to be unwilling to hold elections before then, fearing that the president's supporters, joined by the opposition, would launch a fierce attack against him. 'Nawaz Sharif has staged a legal come-back, not a political come-back. The political reasons that led to the dismissal of the Sharif government still lie unanswered and unredressed,' says Ms Bhutto. Other critics also argue that the government must first establish political peace before becoming confident that it is back to stay and that the country is back on the road to democracy and economic liberalisation. The future of economic reforms will be the ultimate test case, says the chief executive of a large company in Karachi, Pakistan's business capital. 'But right now with all this political uncertainty, the prospects don't seem terribly good unless things settle down.'</p>

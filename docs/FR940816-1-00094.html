			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 668.150&blank; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Agreement between a test publisher and a test administrator.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Except in the case of test administrators at a testing assessment center, the Secretary is proposing that a test publisher must enter into an agreement with each test administrator it certifies to give its test. Initial and continuing approval by the Secretary of a publisher's test is subject to this requirement. The agreement would require the test administrator to be independent from the institution that a student taking the test is attending or is planning to attend. In addition, the agreement would require the test administrator to give the test in accordance with the test publisher's instructions, to secure the test properly against disclosure or release, and to submit the original test answer sheet promptly to the test publisher for grading. The test publisher would have to terminate the agreement with a test administrator if the test publisher finds that the test administrator violated the provisions of the agreement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 668.151&blank; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Agreement between the institution and a certified test administrator.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary proposes that if an institution wishes to award Title IV, HEA program funds to a student without a high school diploma or its recognized equivalent, the institution must enter into a written agreement with a test administrator who has been certified by a test publisher. The Secretary does not consider that a test administrator has an ownership interest in an institution if that ownership interest is derived from ownership of a mutual fund whose portfolio included the stock of the institution or the corporation that owns the institution. In the agreement, the institution would agree not to interfere with or compromise the independence of the test administrator.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary is requesting public comment on the use of the three separate agreements described in &sect;&sect;668.149, 668.150 and 668.151. In commenting on this matter, the Secretary is interested in alternative procedures that would accomplish the same purpose, independence of test administration, but would require only one or two agreements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 668.152&blank; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Administration of tests.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section summarizes the rules regarding the administration of tests under this subpart. In addition, the Secretary proposes that if a student fails a test, the student may not retake the same form of that test for the period specified by the test publisher in the publisher's application that was approved by the Secretary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 668.154&blank; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Institutional accountability.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the Secretary's proposed scheme, institutions will not be part of the process of determining whether students pass approved tests. Therefore, if an institution receives a notice from an approved test publisher that one of its students received a passing score on an approved test, the institution will not be liable to repay any student financial assistance funds the student receives if the student, in actuality, did not pass that test. An institution will be liable only if it used a test administrator that was not independent of the institution, it violated its agreement with a test administrator, it compromised in any way the testing process, or it was unable to document that the student received a passing score on an approved test. These rules are intended to ensure that an institution will not compromise the administration of a test.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Approval of State ``processes.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 668.155&blank; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Approved State process.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under section 484(d) of the HEA, a student without a high school diploma or its recognized equivalent may be eligible to receive Title IV, HEA program funds without passing an independent examination approved by the Secretary if the student is determined to have the ability to benefit from education or training under a State ``process'' approved by the Secretary for that purpose. The State process provision was included in the Higher Education Amendments of 1992 as a result of the action taken by the House of Representatives. The activities the Secretary has proposed for the State process were based upon the description of the State process that was contained in the House Committee Report of the Committee on Education and Labor which accompanied the House version of what was to become the Higher Education Amendments of 1992. The Secretary proposes to approve a State process based upon (1) activities that are included in the process and (2) student outcomes. The proposed rules are designed to ensure that a State process is approved only if the process is effective in enabling students to benefit from the instruction offered by institutions using the process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

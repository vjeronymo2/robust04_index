			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Consumer group warns on rail sale THE privatisation of British Rail should be abandoned unless some serious questions about the government's plans can be satisfactorily answered, the National Consumer Council says in a report today. The report is an embarrassment to the Department of Transport because the council is government-funded and Lady Wilcox, who chairs it, is a member of the prime minister's advisory committee on the Citizen's Charter. Lady Wilcox said the council's own research showed that many rail passengers were unhappy with BR, but it was not yet clear that privatisation was the way to make train services better. 'My council says emphatically that unless satisfactory answers are forthcoming to the questions they are asking, they do not believe that privatisation of British Rail will be in consumers' best interests.' Among fears voiced by the council's report are: Reductions in state subsidies could result in fewer trains and higher fares. It is not clear how standards of frequency and punctuality will be enforced. Passengers may lose benefits such as season tickets, travel cards, through ticketing and national timetables. Blame for service failures will be hard to establish once responsibility for train operation and track ownership has been divided. The council adds that train operators will be at a disadvantage to road transport operators if, as envisaged, they have to pay Railtrack, the body that will own the track after privatisation, a fee based on the number of journeys they make. It suggests instead a flat-rate licence fee similar to the road licence fee. British Rail Privatisation, National Consumer Council, 20 Grosvenor Gardens, London SW1W 0DH. Free with A4 SAE.</p>

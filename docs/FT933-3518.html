			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Clinton eases sanctions against Vietnam: Trade embargo stays but president hints at future moves towards relaxation PRESIDENT Bill Clinton last night eased economic sanctions against Vietnam but refused to lift the trade embargo until Hanoi resolves the issue of US servicemen missing from the Vietnam War. In a four-page statement released by the White House, Mr Clinton said the US would allow American companies to participate in development projects in Vietnam funded by international financial institutions. This should ease fears that US taxpayers are funding projects - through the World Bank - in which US companies are not allowed to participate. This year the US dropped objections to allowing Vietnam to refinance its international debts, clearing the way for International Monetary Fund and World Bank loans. Last year President George Bush allowed US companies to sign, but not execute, contracts with the Vietnamese. US businesses are eager for Mr Clinton to allow trade in all but strategic sectors, before Europeans and others capture the Vietnamese market, according to Mr John Howard of the US Chamber of Commerce. 'Our members have long recognised that unilateral sanctions like this only benefit our competition.' The main obstacle to lifting the embargo is still the tension about the fate of US prisoners of war and soldiers 'missing in action' held at the end of the Vietnamese war. Last week a document surfaced in Russia suggesting that Vietnam held more prisoners than it had previously admitted. Vietnam rejected the report, but it has 'got people shaky again', said one Senate aide. 'There are a lot of people who will never be satisfied' that the Vietnamese have been open in dealing with the MIA-POW issue, said Ms Kathleen Bertelsen, an aide with the House subcommittee on economic policy, trade and environment. A commission headed by Senator John Kerry that found no evidence that Vietnam still held US prisoners 'relaxed some members of Congress,' Ms Bertelsen said. But there would not be wide support in Congress for lifting the embargo until 'the bulk of (members) feel relatively comfortable that MIA-POW (representatives) will not come to their town meetings and start screaming at them.' Today was the annual deadline for the president to renew the list of countries with which trade is barred under the US Trading with the Enemy Act. Several other countries are on the list along with Vietnam.</p>

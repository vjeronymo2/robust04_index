			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Y.C. Tsai] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 4 (CNA) -- Governor Samuel Shieh of the  Central Bank of China said Wednesday [4 May] that he would seek  the support of Latin American countries for Taiwan's bid to  become a non-regional member of the Inter-American Development  Bank (IDB).    Shieh made the remark prior to his departure for Managua,  Nicaragua with President Li Teng-hui, who embarked on a 13-day  official visit to Nicaragua, Costa Rica, South Africa, and  Swaziland Wednesday morning.    To help promote Taiwan's efforts to become an IDB member,  Shieh said, the Ministry of Finance has earmarked NT [new  Taiwan] $135 million (US$5.09 million) in its 1995 fiscal year  budget as a trust fund for the Inter-American Bank.    In addition, he pointed out, the Export-Import Bank of the  Republic of China [ROC] has decided to join with the IDB to  extend a soft loan of US$50 million to Nicaragua, of which the  Export- Import Bank will provide US$30 million.    Founded in 1959, the IDB boasts 19 members and is the  world's  largest regional development bank. The bank, with its  headquarters in Washington, D.C., offers medium and long-term  loans to Latin American countries to help boost their economic  development.</p>

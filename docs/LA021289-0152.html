			<p><P> February 12, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> COMMENTARY;  </P> <P> A LOOK BENEATH 'YET ANOTHER' LAWSUIT REVEALS GOOD GOVERNMENT AT WORK  </P> <P> In November, the cities of Escondido, Carlsbad and Encinitas sued the County of  San Diego, challenging the secretive manner in which it was conducting contract  negotiations for the proposed San Marcos trash-to-energy plant. To those weary  of litigation against the plant, the lawsuit was just another example of people  using the court process to stop something they simply did not like.  </P> <P> On top of that, it seemed as if tax dollars were being used for three public  agencies to bring a lawsuit, and tax dollars were being used for another public  agency to defend it. At first glance, it appeared that the real loser here  wasn't so much the trash-to-energy plant but the taxpayers.  </P> <P> However, first glances can be deceptive, and there is a more important lesson  to be learned from a closer reading of the cities' lawsuit against the county.  </P> <P> The three cities are next to San Marcos and are concerned about the effect of  the plant on their communities. But more than that, the cities are challenging  the way the county has been doing business concerning the largest proposed  public-works project in San Diego's history. Escondido, Carlsbad and Encinitas  are alleging that the county has violated public records and competitive  bidding laws in pursuing secret negotiations with the proponents of the  trash-to-energy plant.  </P> <P> Christward Ministry, a private entity, also filed a lawsuit challenging the  county's way of conducting business, though from a different angle. Christward  Ministry alleged that the county failed to give citizens notice and an  opportunity to be heard (as required by California's open meeting law) and that  the Board of Supervisors spent public money for the plant negotiations without  the necessary number of votes.  </P> <P> Taken together, the cases have an important lesson for the residents of San  Diego County.  </P> <P> Public agencies in California are subject to some of the most rigorous  procedural rules imposed on local governments in the nation. There is the Brown  Act, which requires that meetings be open to the public, that agendas with all  items for action be posted in advance of meetings and that citizens be given an  opportunity to comment on proposed actions.  </P> <P> There is the Public Records Act, requiring that public records be made  available to citizens. There are also laws requiring competitive bidding for  public projects and other procedural rules, such as that section of the  government code cited by Christward Ministry requiring four votes before the  Board of Supervisors can spend certain revenues.  </P> <P> All of these laws have been enacted because citizens require that their  governing bodies act in an open manner so that they can be held accountable.  </P> <P> Nobody knows these laws better than the public agencies that operate under  them. Most public officials in California can quote the basics of the Brown Act  from memory. The public-records law is highly familiar to public officials who  work with it on a daily basis. Competitive bidding is a basic prerequisite to  most public projects. Public lawyers work with these laws all of the time and  must be prepared to advise city councils, boards of supervisors and the public  of what the laws mean and what they require.  </P> <P> Consequently, when one public agency says another public agency is not going by  the rules that govern all of them, it is worth a second look.  </P> <P> We expect citizens to police their governments. The Christward Ministries  lawsuit is an example of this watchdog activity by a private entity.  </P> <P> We should also expect our public agencies to police each other. That is part of  the system of checks and balances that has kept this country and its many local  governments on an even keel for more than two centuries. This was aptly stated  by the California Supreme Court: "If we say with Mr. Justice Holmes, 'Men must  turn square corners when they deal with the government', it is hard to see why  the government should not be held to a like standard of rectangular rectitude  when dealing with its citizens."  </P> <P> In this case, that system is working well.  </P> <P> Escondido, Carlsbad and Encinitas should not be taken lightly when they speak  out concerning how another local government is conducting its affairs.  </P> <P> Regardless of how the cities and their constituents feel about a proposed  trash-to-energy plant, they know the rules because they operate under them  every day. And the cities should be the first to recognize when those rules are  being violated.  </P> <P> What's more, if a judge requires absolute adherence to these important  procedural laws, the cities bringing the lawsuit will be obliged to follow  those same procedures. The burden may fall on the county as an immediate  result, but precedent will be established binding the cities as well. This  provides ample incentive for the cities to have carefully considered the merits  of their position before commencing the litigation.  </P> <P> Even the county should be inclined to admit at least the spirit, if not the  details, of these lawsuits. If the county really believes that a  trash-to-energy plant would be in the best interest of its constituents, that  interest is better served through a process in which everybody knows what is  going on and has a chance to comment.  </P> <P> Even for opponents of the plant, there must exist at least the satisfaction of  knowing how the decision was made and knowing that the process was in  compliance with each and every applicable law.  </P> <P> The public perception issue cannot be ignored either. A recent editorial in  this paper correctly noted the frustration shared with opponents about the lack  of public information on the project and encouraged the county to open the  contract proposal to public scrutiny.  </P> <P> In sum, a first glance may indicate just one more vexatious lawsuit by some  disgruntled public agencies. But a second, more careful look, will reveal some  genuine concerns for all residents in this county. These lawsuits say more  about good government than they do about trash to energy.  </P></p>

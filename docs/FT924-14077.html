			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Butte warranty claim BUTTE Mining, which is claiming damages of Dollars 325m (Pounds 182.5m) in the US against more than 70 former advisers, directors and investors, is about to embark on another legal action, this time in the UK, writes Peggy Hollinger. Mr David Lloyd-Jacob, chairman of Butte, said that the company intended to launch a warranty claim for more than Pounds 500,000 over a company purchased in 1989. Butte paid 9.2m shares for Gramcol Zircon, a mining company allegedly holding cash resources which Butte desperately needed. The vendors were Mr Don Upright, Mr Neil Bradley and Mr CJ Deacon, a solicitor. In the summer, Mr Deacon was involved in assisting pension fund trustees of Belling recover Pounds 2.1m paid to one of his clients. The purchase agreement for Gramcol Zircon included warranties by the vendors, excluding Mr Deacon, that the company would have 'not less than Pounds 1.8m standing at credit in the company's bank account'. However, Butte received just Pounds 1.25m from Gramcol Zircon's account. Mr Deacon was paid 5m Butte shares as part of the Gramcol transaction. The Pounds 1.25m appears to have been the proceeds of a placing of Mr Deacon's shares by TC Coombs, the now defunct stockbroker.</p>

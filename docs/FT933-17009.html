			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / S Africa democracy talks move forward SOUTH AFRICA'S multi-party democracy negotiators last night overcame another hurdle on the path to a new constitution, after they agreed that an elected constituent assembly should write the final post-apartheid constitution. The agreement came after the Inkatha Freedom Party had dropped its insistence that the 26-party forum of appointed representatives, which has been sitting since April, write a final constitution. Instead, the 26-party forum will write an interim constitution - which could remain in force for several years - and set out binding principles by which a final constitution will be written by the elected body. These principles, with the force of law, will include substantial devolution of power to regions, a key demand of Inkatha and other parties from black homelands. Inkatha had feared that an elected constituent assembly, in which it is likely to have a limited role, would ignore its demand for strong regional government. But its fears were assuaged when the multi-party forum promised to agree regional powers ahead of the assembly. However, although Inkatha and its allies agreed to the process by which a constitution should be written, they reserved the right to reject the interim constitution to be eventually written. Regions would have their own constitutions and legislatures, like US states. An official of the African National Congress yesterday called for the imposition of a heavy 'reconstruction levy', on individuals and corporations in South Africa, to finance the building of a 'new and more equal' post-apartheid society. Writing in the Johannesburg Star newspaper, Mr Tito Mboweni, deputy head of the ANC economics department and a chief economic policy-maker, urged that the levy be on the lines of Germany's post-war levy, whereby individuals and corporations paid half their assets to the state to help finance reconstruction.</p>

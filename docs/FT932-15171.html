			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / Unpopular governor asks for more time GOVERNOR Jim Florio of New Jersey has given encouragement this week to all incumbent politicians who have plumbed the depths of unpopularity while in office. He announced that he will seek re-election in November to a second term. The east coast Democrat is by no means sure of success. Most state polls show him behind, or level with, two prominent Republicans, Mrs Christine Todd Whitman and Mr Carey Edwards. Both have recently been saddled with another contemporary US problem, failure to pay taxes on their domestic staff. But the fact that the governor is now given a fighting chance has made him very much the Easter week candidate, for few politicians have ever been declared so politically dead, so often, as has the 55-year-old Mr Florio. If he recovers and wins in the autumn, then many others who had fallen on hard times through their attempts to impose fiscal disciplines on their states may take heart. Among them are Mr Pete Wilson, Republican governor of California, and even Mr Mario Cuomo, Democratic governor of New York and no longer a candidate for the next vacancy on the US Supreme Court. Mr Florio, elected in 1989 by a landslide, had seemed the quintessential victim of the Republican era of revulsion to higher taxes. He immediately pushed through the state legislature, then in Democratic hands, a Dollars 2.8bn tax increase, plus other controversial measures covering education, insurance and gun control. Political retribution was immediate. Within two years the legislature was in Republican hands and the state's most popular politician, Democratic Senator Bill Bradley, nearly lost his re-election bid to Mrs Whitman because of his association with Mr Florio. However, in recent months a recovery seems to have been under way in the state economy and in the governor's fortunes. A victory was recorded this year when the legislature withstood great pressure from the National Rifle Association (NRA) and refused to override his veto of attempts to eviscerate his tough gun control law. The fact that Mr Florio has recruited Mr James Carville, President Bill Clinton's strategic mastermind last year, to direct his re-election effort is considered important. The 'ragin' Cajun', who also engineered the stunning Pennsylvania Senate by-election victory in 1991 by Mr Harris Wofford, the Democratic longshot, is the hottest political adviser in the US at present. In declaring his candidacy this week, Mr Florio sought to cast himself, not unlike Mr Clinton, as a man unafraid to take tough decisions in difficult times. Also borrowing from earlier in the president's political career, he said he had learned in his first term 'to talk less and listen more'. Mr Clinton lost his first bid for re-election as governor of Arkansas largely because he had tried to push through a series of measures considered too radical by his state.</p>

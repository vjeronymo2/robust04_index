			<p>BFN     [Text] Mr. 'Abd-al-Basit Sabdarat, minister of culture and  information, issued a statement today concerning the abduction  of Sudan's ambassador to Somalia. The statement said an armed  group, composed of three persons belonging to the Somali  (Kawadla) tribe, abducted Sudanese Ambassador 'Abd-al-Baqi  Muhammad Hasan while he was driving home after work on 19 April.    Immediately after the incident Sudanese authorities  conducted  intensive diplomatic and political maneuvers with all the  concerned parties in Somalia, in particular, and the Horn of  Africa, in general. These actions included direct dialogue with  the abductors, which continued until late last night and carried  on until this morning.    The abductors asked for hard currency in exchange for  freeing  the ambassador. According to a statement, the ambassador is  alive and well and is enjoying good health. The statement also  reports that he was not harmed in any way. The statement  continues, saying that the Sudanese authorities will make every  effort to ensure that the Sudanese ambassador to Somalia is  returned safely.</p>

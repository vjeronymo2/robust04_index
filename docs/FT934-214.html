			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / Owls and moles: The best business books of the year One burning question for the first few months of 1994 will be how long the current bull market in the New York and London equity markets can continue. Stock market futurologists are two-a-penny, but small investors could well take strategic advice from Peter Lynch, who transformed Fidelity's Magellan mutual fund from a Dollars 18m weakling in 1977 into a Dollars 14bn giant when he stepped down in 1990. His second book on investment, Beating the Street (Simon &amp; Schuster) is full of encouraging anecdotes about how the private investor can outperform the professionals. It is liberally sprinkled with pungent one-liners such as: 'Never invest in any idea you can't illustrate with a crayon,' or 'All else being equal, invest in the company with the fewest colour photographs in the annual report.' Readers will start to believe they are capable of finding one of Lynch's 'tenbaggers' - stocks that rise tenfold and make up for the duds in the portfolio. The recent successful conclusion of a world trade agreement removed one potential threat to market rallies. But optimism that another lease of life for Gatt ensures a new era of prosperity will be tempered by reading Preparing For The Twenty-First Century (Harper Collins) by Paul Kennedy, a professor of history at Yale. This fair-minded overview of economic trends, threats to the environment, and growing demographic imbalances suggests humanity faces challenges with which it is ill-equipped to cope. Kennedy concedes that market forces and developments in areas such as bio-technology might provide answers. For a more immediate look at the challenges facing corporate strategists, try Mass Customization by B Joseph Pine (Harvard Business School Press). The book poses an increasingly common business conundrum: how to cater to ever more individualistic customer demands while retaining the cost efficiencies of traditional mass-production. Pine argues that companies can - and will be obliged to - do both, but only if they radically restructure their operations to make flexibility and the provision of tailor-made solutions a way of life. If Pine is visionary, John Kay's Foundations of Corporate Success (Oxford University Press) is refreshingly iconoclastic. Taking the axe to fashionable theories about corporate strategy, Kay likens many of the nostrums peddled by business gurus to quack medicine. He argues that trying to divine why some companies succeed is pointless, because the reasons in each case are peculiar to the companies concerned. Instead of looking for corporate role models to emulate, managers should identify what 'distinctive capabilities' their company possesses and use them to differentiate it from competitors. Whether or not you accept Kay's theory, the book is thought-provoking and thoroughly documented. However, he does not entirely avoid some of the pitfalls he criticises in others - such as compiling lists of star companies. It is by no means obvious that Glaxo, Guinness and LVMH, for instance, will shine as brightly this decade as they did in the last. Another 1980s success story currently in difficulty is Nintendo, the Japanese video game manufacturer. David Sheff's book, How Nintendo Zapped an American Industry, Captured Your Dollars, and Enslaved Your Children (Random House), provides a well-researched and colourful insight into the rise of the company through the late 1980s. Nevertheless, Sheff, a California-based author, argues that Nintendo made a serious mistake when it delayed releasing a more powerful and advanced video games machine - a lapse which allowed Sega, its arch rival, to secure a foothold in the market. One role of business books such as Sheff's is to look beneath the gleam of the brightest shiners. Take Procter &amp; Gamble, for example, which carefully cultivates the image of enlightened employer and housewife's friend. In reality, according to Alecia Swasy, a Wall Street Journal reporter who used to cover P&amp;G, it is a paranoid, sinister institution, obsessed by secrecy and control, which spies on its employees and bullies those who stand in its way. P&amp;G's notorious secrecy makes it an excellent subject for investigation and Swasy's book, Soap Opera. The Inside Story of Procter &amp; Gamble (Times Books), the product of interviews with more than 300 current and former P&amp;G employees, provides important insights into the company's ugly side. She argues that the abrasive management style of chairman Ed Artzt, widely known as the Prince of Darkness, is undermining company morale and prompting a troubling brain drain among senior executives. How unfortunate, then, that this determined digging is marred by such a one-sided tone, by generalities and argumentative non sequiturs, that the book undermines much of its own credibility. For writers, as well as companies, manipulating the public's view of the past, present and future may be the key to success: 'The only way to build the future is to build it on lies,' was the maxim of Armand Hammer, the founder of Occidental Petroleum, who died in 1990 at the age of 92. According to Carl Blumay's chronicle, The Dark Side of Power: the real Armand Hammer (Simon Schuster), Hammer rarely departed from that principle. Blumay should know. He ran Occidental's public relations operations for 25 years, building the public image that Hammer was a business genius and a philanthropist with influence in the Kremlin and the White House. The reality, Blumay says, was a backstage drama of bribes, manipulation, financial losses, a gun-toting delinquent son and a collection of high-cheekboned mistresses on both sides of the Iron Curtain. Blumay's highly entertaining book says little of his own reasons for helping Hammer mislead the outside world, and his sources are few and hard to corroborate. The question is whether his account can be believed - there is still room for a definitive book telling the whole truth about Armand Hammer. Perhaps next year.

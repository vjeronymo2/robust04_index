			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with EC Commission Deputy President Sir Leon </F> Brittan by Christophe Lamfalussy on 3 May; place not given:  "Almost All the Heads of Government Are Keeping Their Cards  Close to Their Chest" -- first two paragraphs are LA LIBRE  BELGIQUE introduction]    [Text] At the age of 54, Sir Leon Brittan is certainly not  at the end of his career. But the battle he has launched in  difficult conditions to try to succeed Jacques Delors is one of  the great challenges he has set himself.    At a time when Jean-Luc Dehaene is hiding behind his "no  comment," Margaret Thatcher's former minister is playing the  openness card. He has just written a book, The Europe We  Need which has been published by Plon. In addition, the  European Commission (EC) deputy president is granting  interviews, like the one he granted to LA LIBRE BELGIQUE on  Tuesday morning [3 May]:    [Lamfalussy] Are you, after all, the only declared candidate  to replace Jacques Delors?    [Brittan] I am not a declared candidate. This is not an  election campaign. But everybody knows that the British  Government has nominated me. And I have publicly said that I am  available. I have worked here for five years and six months.  It would be a great honor to do something more for Europe if  the heads of state and of government so wish. Because there are  discussions on this subject, in the new world of openness and  democracy, I think we must be clear and express our ideas.    [Lamfalussy] You are the only one to be putting your cards  on  the table....    [Brittan] Almost all (the heads of state and of government  --  LA LIBRE BELGIQUE editor's note) have told me that being open is  an advantage for Europe.    [Lamfalussy] Do you still have a chance?    [Brittan] It is clear that most of the governments have not  yet decided. The decision will be made in Corfu. A great deal  is being written in the newspapers. This is mainly speculation.  Almost all the heads of government are keeping their cards  close to their chest.    [Lamfalussy] Do you therefore expect a decision at the Corfu  summit?    [Brittan] It will be made in Corfu. That is a legal  necessity. We must prepare for the new Commission. And the  European Parliament now also has a say.    [Lamfalussy] Is it a handicap to be British?    [Brittan] I assume that the guarantee of having no national  discrimination exists for the choice of the future EC president  too.    [Lamfalussy] The British Government has adopted positions  which have offended France, Germany, and other countries....    [Brittan] I am supported by the British Government but in  full awareness of my differences of opinion. The British  Government understands this very well and has stressed the fact  that I am independent. My book is not an expression of the  British Government's view.    [Lamfalussy] In this connection, is one of the big  differences your support for monetary union?    [Brittan] And this is nothing new. Even before I came to  Brussels, after my resignation from the British Government, the  first speech I delivered in the House of Commons advocated  Britain's entry into the the Exchange Rate Mechanism at a time  when the government had not yet decided to do so.    [Lamfalussy] You are relatively optimistic about monetary  union, but with the feeling that a hard core will be  necesssary....    [Brittan] This is the Maastricht Treaty plan. A degree of  temporary variable geometry is included in the treaty for those  who satisfy the convergence criteria. Those who are really in a  position to start the third phase will do so. The others will  wait.    [Lamfalussy] Should these convergence criteria be strictly  implemented?    [Brittan] We must not change them. But you will find in the  treaty provision for the possibility of examining the progress  made in a dynamic way. This means that if a country is in a  position which is close to the criteria and is on the right  path, it would be possible to judge that the time had come.    [Lamfalussy] In your book, you do not cite Belgium as one of  the countries which could join the first group?    [Brittan] This does not mean that Belgium is excluded from  it! It is perfectly possible. Starting the third phase in 1997  is doubtful. But doing so in 1999 is possible. A great deal  can happen in five years.    [Lamfalussy] Your book reflects your economic concerns, free  trade, opening up to East Europe, monetary union. However, the  big date for Europe in the coming years is political. It will  be the 1996 intergovernmental conference.    [Brittan] It is obvious that the conference is important.  The central concept is that we should not choose between  expansion and deepening. Both must be chosen. We must accept  the Central and East European countries for moral, economic, and  political reasons. Moral because we must help these countries to  continue along their path. Economic because the inclusion of  these countries will ultimately be an advantage for us.  Political because if we are negative toward them, the result  will be to push them toward the Russians. They will have no  alternative. But these countries themselves do not want to join  a Community which would be weakened. Deepening must therefore be  continued.... My view of Europe is that it must be open and  capable of defending itself. For that, it must be united and  have a driving force. And that driving force is the Commission.    [Lamfalussy] What do you think of the Delors years?    [Brittan] The position of the institutions has been  enormously strengthened. The leadership has really been able to  provide a vision.    [Lamfalussy] What should the future EC president be like?    [Brittan] It is not for me to define him. I express my ideas  very frankly. But it is for other to say what personal  qualities the future president should have.</p>

			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: Conflicting factors THE DOLLAR'S exchange rate against the D-Mark will be swayed by conflicting forces this week, writes James Blitz. Pushing the US currency upwards are growing expectations that the Bundesbank will aggressively ease monetary policy next month, narrowing the differential between US and German interest rates. Undermining the currency, however, are concerns that the upturn in the US economy is still not as strong as expected. The Bundesbank's decision to cut its money market dealing rate has probably given the dollar a firm underpinning for the next week or two. The recent 15 basis point cut in the fixed rate repo, to 8.60 per cent, has been well received by the markets, pushing the dollar as high as DM1.6490 in European trading on Friday. However, dealers will be watching the next two Bundesbank council meetings to see whether the central bank follows last Thursday's move with another cut, either in money market rates or the officially-posted Lombard and discount rates. This week, in particular, dealers will be watching progress in the talks on the German wage round and budget deficit. A successful conclusion to these talks would make it easier for the German central bank to ease policy again next month. Last Friday's poorer-than-expected figure for US employment may give the dollar a slightly weaker tone, however. The non-farm payroll figure in the US is still seen as one of the best indications of the strength of the country's economy. It tends to have a strong impact on dollar trading for several days afterwards. The latest figure, for December, proved something of a disappointment in Friday afternoon trading, rising by 64,000 on the month, when dealers had been looking for a rise of more than 100,000. The US weekly jobless claims figures on Thursday will therefore be watched particularly closely.</p>

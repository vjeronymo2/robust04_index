			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Pounds 32m loss on tool hire sale hits Mowlem Interim losses at Mowlem soared to Pounds 41.8m after a Pounds 32m loss on a tool hire business it sold recently. Excluding the charge, the pre-tax loss and turnover were static at Pounds 9.8m and Pounds 658m, but the contractor and housebuilder maintained the interim dividend at 2p believing cost-cutting efforts will pay off next year. 'The benefit of cost-cutting measures will be clearly apparent in the 1994 results and the overall financial strength of the group means we are maintaining the interim dividend,' said Sir Philip Beck, chairman. 'While there are some signs of recovery in the overall UK economy, the improvement is still weak, uneven and, as widely reported, shows few signs of feeding through into the construction industry,' he added. Sir Philip said he expected the company to incur a full-year pre-tax loss 'broadly similar' to last time's Pounds 38.5m, before the loss on the disposal of the profitable HSS Hire Service Group in May for Pounds 52m. Under new accounting requirements Mowlem reinstated to reserves Pounds 42.5m of goodwill previously written off, offset by a Pounds 32m loss on the disposal based on the original purchase price. The net effect was a Pounds 10m gain in shareholders funds. The first-half 1992 pre-tax loss was Pounds 10m on turnover of Pounds 652m. Losses per share were 39.5p (9.7p loss before the charge) against losses of 9.3p a year earlier. For the fifth time, Mowlem has dipped into reserves, withdrawing Pounds 2.3m to pay the Pounds 2.2m interim dividend. All divisions recorded operating losses except scaffolding, which made profits of Pounds 2.4m (Pounds 1.8m), and contracting, which broke even compared with a Pounds 500,000 loss last time. Housing incurred a loss of Pounds 700,000 (Pounds 500,000 profits), while aviation was Pounds 2.4m (Pounds 2.5m) in the red.</p>

			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Rexmore highlights recovery potential Rexmore, the contract furnishings group, is forecasting a substantial recovery in earnings in the current year following the elimination of timber losses, lower interest charges and a reduced tax charge. 'We have achieved a number of aims', said Mr Abraham Rosenblatt, chairman. The objective for the current year was to consolidate on the success of contract furnishing. The first four months showed a significant improvement. In the year to April 3 the group incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.36m (Pounds 896,000) after total costs of Pounds 2.4m relating to the discontinued timber side. Continuing activities made operating profits of Pounds 1.77m (Pounds 1.79m) from turnover of Pounds 31.5m (Pounds 30.2m). Interest charges were cut to Pounds 649,000 (Pounds 916,000). Bank borrowings had been reduced by Pounds 2.6m and year-end gearing was down from 44.4 per cent to 13.9 per cent. Losses per share worked through at 7.7p (7p) but the dividend is held at 1.75p with an unchanged final of 1.05p.</p>

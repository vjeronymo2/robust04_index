			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / International Company News: SIA profits fall 15% at halfway SINGAPORE Airlines (SIA), consistently one of the world's most profitable carriers, blamed recession in many markets, intense competition and the strength of the Singapore dollar for a 15 per cent drop in pre-tax profits for the six months ending September 30. SIA had pre-tax profits of SDollars 423.5m (USDollars 269m) in the six months, compared with pre-tax profits of SDollars 498m in the same period last year. While SIA reported that turnover had increased by 10.3 per cent to SDollars 3.04bn, it said that intense competition had cut yields and lowered revenue by SDollars 187m. The airline said revenues were cut by a further SDollars 48m due to the strength of the Singapore dollar. Mr Cheong Choong Kong, SIA's managing director, said the airline was working in a very difficult business environment. 'SIA's first-half profit was lower than a year ago but considering the performance of the competition, we did not do too badly,' said Mr Cheong. Cathay Pacific, one of SIA's main competitors in the Far East, recently reported a 46 per cent fall in interim earnings. 'Although the industry continues to be plagued by low yields, traffic has picked up over the past few months and load factors are higher than the same period last year,' said Mr Cheong. 'It is tempting to conclude that the worst is over but it is too soon to tell.' SIA's interim results were below market expectations. SIA is committed to maintaining a young fleet of aircraft but in recent years it has faced increasing difficulty off-loading older aircraft in what has been a poor second-hand market. SIA consolidates the revenues from aircraft sales into its operating profits. However, SIA is still cash rich - net cash reserves declined slightly over the six-month period to SDollars 1.27bn. Earnings per share over the six-month period were 30.5 Singapore cents, compared with 34.8 cents in the same period last year. The dividend was unchanged at 7.5 cents.</p>

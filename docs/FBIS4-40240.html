			<p>BFN     [Text] Stepanakert ("YERKIR" daily - Haylur), 06/14/94 -- A  "Haylur" correspondent met Acting Chairman of the RMK [Republic  of Mountainous Karabakh] Supreme Council Karen Baburyan, who  just returned from St. Petersburg, and asked to comment on the  results of the meeting.    "I met Chairmen of Armenian and Azeri parliaments, Chairman  of the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly V. Shumeyko, Chairman of  the Kyrgyz Supreme Council and Chairman of the CIS  Interparliamentary Group on Karabakh M. Sherimkulov, Special  Envoy of the Russian President V. Kazimirov in St. Petersburg.    The essence of the meeting was that the Bishkek agreement  exists, and (development in) this (direction) should continue.  The session of the Interparliamentarian assembly discussed the  ways of resolving the Abkhazian conflict. Several announcements  were made regarding the Karabakh conflict, but no concrete  documents have been signed. The agreements were mainly oral.  One of the most important, is about creation and functioning of  CIS peace-making forces. These were the most important problems  discussed in St. Petersburg.    I may add that I visited Moscow before the St. Petersburg  meeting, and met the leaders of the Russian parliament. We  discussed the details and ways of resolving the Karabakh  conflict. This all has once again been confirmed in St.  Petersburg. Active work will start in a few days, in order to  support the efforts of the parliamentarians by actions of  executive bodies."</p>

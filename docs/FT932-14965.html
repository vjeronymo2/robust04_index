			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / UK currency plan likely to be vetoed PROPOSALS by Britain to increase support for weak currencies in the European exchange rate mechanism seem likely to be vetoed by other countries in a move which could add a further barrier to the UK's eventual re-entry into the system. The suggestion was made during discussions by the European Community's committee of central bank governors. The group is meeting early next week in Basle, Switzerland, to finalise a report on possible ERM reforms. Under the UK's proposal, weak currencies in the system could be helped by joint efforts by several ERM countries, rather than the single country with the strongest currency. These technical moves would be a mixture of both interventions on currency markets and changes in interest rates. Profits and losses on purchases of weak currencies to increase their value would be shared by all the nations in the system. The UK suggestion, which comes close to following a policy idea from the opposition Labour party, has received only limited support from the other 11 nations represented on the governors' committee. One objection, voiced in particular by the German Bundesbank, is that the proposal might reduce the pressures on countries with weak currencies to devalue in order to remove currency strains. However, some support for the concept of sharing out the burden of supporting weak currencies is believed to have come from nations such as Spain, Portugal and Ireland.</p>

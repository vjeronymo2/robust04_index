			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / Football race-abuse incidents down Football grounds have seen a marked decline in incidents of racial abuse and harassment at the end of a season-long campaign. But the Commission for Racial Equality warned yesterday that there is still work to be done to promote clubs as safe, welcoming environments. In the three years since the passing of the Football Offences Act, which outlawed racist chanting and abuse, the number of arrests has fallen from 76 in 1991-92 to 40 in 1992-93 and 12 in 1993-94.</p>

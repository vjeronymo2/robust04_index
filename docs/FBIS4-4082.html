			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] In Wuchang yesterday afternoon, the provincial  party committee and government held a meeting on the development  of individual and private economies. [passage omitted]    The meeting was presided over by Governor Jia Zhijie, deputy  secretary of the provincial party committee. In attendance were  Hui Liangyu, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee  and chairman of the provincial committee of the Chinese People's  Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC]; Vice Governor Chen  Shuiwen; and Ping Linbo, vice chairman of the CPPCC provincial  committee. Chairman Hui Liangyu delivered an important speech  and Chen Shuiwen [words indistinct] on the province's  development of individual and private economies.    The meeting pointed out that last year, the province  witnessed an expansion in the individual and private economies.  [words indistinct] A number of counties and cities saw rapid  development in their economies. Twenty-two counties, cities,  and districts had more than 10,000 individual industrial and  commercial businesses; 13 counties, cities, and districts had  more than 100 privately run enterprises; and individually and  privately run businesses in 46 counties, cities, and districts  had an output value and business volume of more than 100 million  yuan, and the individually and privately run businesses in  Xiantao and Tianmen had more than 1 billion yuan in output value  and business volume. Individually and privately run enterprises  have become a new important force in the local economy, though  the individual and private economies remain weak links in the  province's economy.    The meeting stressed that the guiding thinking on developing  the individual and private economies this year is to further and  earnestly implement the party Central Committee's policy of  encouraging and supporting the development of the individual and  private industries, to deepen reform, to offer specific  guidance, and to combine protection of enthusiasm with guidance  of development, with readjustment of the industrial structure  and the product mix, with maintenance of value and appreciation  of state-owned assets, and with the urbanization process.  [passage omitted]    1. Principal leaders of governments at all levels and  persons in charge of the departments concerned must further  enhance their understanding and achieve unity in thinking. The  province's individual and private economies are inadequately,  rather than sufficiently developed. From the experiences of  advanced localities in our province, we can see that paying  attention to the development of the individual and private  economies not only will help bring opportunities for their  growth and innovative development,but also will promote the  development of the state-owned and collective economies. The  key to the development of the individual and private economies  lies in leadership, and the responsibility for their development  lies with leadership. [passage omitted]    2. Policies should be further relaxed, and specific measures  should be implemented effectively. The policies of the  provincial party committee and government for the development of  the individual and private economies should be implemented from  top to bottom. [passage omitted]    The provincial people's congress will decide on the taxation  policy toward the individual and private economies in the form  of laws and regulations, and will place the task in this year's  plan for enactment of local laws. The provincial government  also will work out relevant laws and regulations so as to  provide a legal guarantee for the legitimate rights and  interests of individually or privately run enterprises.  Localities are encouraged to formulate corresponding  administrative regulations.    3. Production and operation links should be improved  further, the principle of investors reaping the benefits from  their investments should be upheld, and individual industrial  and commercial businesses and privately run enterprises should  be encouraged to invest in the construction of markets.  [passage omitted]    4. It is necessary to further strengthen leadership,  organize relevant departments to jointly manage the development  of the individual and private economies, earnestly assign this  year's development tasks to all sides concerned under a  responsibility system under which tasks are assigned on a  quarterly basis and task completion is assessed at the year's  end. [passage omitted]    Present at the meeting were persons in charge of the  provincial departments concerned; members of the provincial  leading group for the development of the individual and private  economies; [words indistinct]; principal leaders of the party  committees and governments of various prefectures, autonomous  prefectures, cities, and counties; government officials in  charge of the development of the individual and private  economies; members of local leading groups for the private  economy; and persons in charge of the industrial and commercial,  financial, personnel and labor, auditing, banking, [words  indistinct] departments.

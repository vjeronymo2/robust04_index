			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / Rescue opens for standards service An effort by businesses to amend legislation on local-government reorganisation in order to counter costly fragmentation of the trading standards service will begin next week. Lord Elton, a Conservative peer, is to table an amendment to the bill for Wales - which would create 21 unitary authorities in place of eight counties  -to provide three trading standards authorities for the principality. Trading standards have hitherto been a county council responsibility in both England and Wales. Lord Elton's amendment has all-party support. Similar plans are likely to be recommended by the Local Government Commission. Mr Paul Allen, chairman of the Institute of Trading Standards, said that spreading the service over 21 authorities in Wales would fragment it to the extent that 'it will not be capable of dealing with national and international cases'. The institute claims that the legislation, as it stands, will 'substantially increase the burdens on business, reduce the services' effectiveness, and substantially increase costs'. Groups backing the institute's view include the Confederation of British Industry and the British Retail Consortium. The institute cites a survey by Birmingham University's Institute of Local Government Studies which says: that 'The minimum size of authority for effective administration of the service is 750,000 population.' Mr Allen points out that the government plans to create only three police authorities for Wales.</p>

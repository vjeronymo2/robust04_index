			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Tokyo, April 8 KYODO -- Embattled Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa made a surprise announcement Friday [8 April]  of his intention to resign because of controversy over personal  financial deals and the resultant parliamentary paralysis  crippling his eight-month-old administration.    Hosokawa's bombshell announcement prompted the seven  coalition parties to scramble to the task of picking his  successor.    Although Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and Komeito [Clean  Government Party], key parties in the coalition, voiced support  for Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata who  leads Shinseito, the Social Democratic Party (SDP) and  Democratic Socialist Party (DSP) expressed disaffection with the  proposal.    The 56-year-old Hosokawa told a hurriedly-arranged news  conference he had decided to give up the office of prime  minister to take "moral and political responsibility" for a  fresh financial scandal and the current stalemate of the Diet.    "A new problem has come to light. New suspicions emerged  that my political office entrusted a certain person with  managing my personal financial means, raking in profits for a  few years since 1981," the premier said.    "The suspicion is that his management may have involved some  illegalities, although the person, who is my old friend, asked  for permission to manage my personal money, saying it would  definitely be invested in a profitable manner," he said.    He said the new revelation came on top of controversy about  100 million yen that Hosokawa described as a loan from a  trucking company already at the center of a money-and-mob  scandal.    The opposition camp held up Diet debate on the fiscal 1994  fiscal budget, saying Hosokawa should first agree to the  opposition demand to have his financial aide Masatoshi Miyama  testify as a witness to clear up suspicions on the allegedly  questionable finances.    Hosokawa officially offered his resignation at an emergency  cabinet meeting after making a surprise announcement to a  hastily summoned meeting of leaders of the coalition partners.    In a second get-together of the coalition leaders later in  the day, Komeito Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa insisted that  the coalition parties first narrow the differences in their  defense and diplomatic policies before making a decision on  whether to maintain the current combination of parties.    Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa, a behind-the-scene  strategist, Japan New Party leader Masuo Matsuoka and DSP  Secretary General Takashi Yonezawa threw their weight behind the  Komeito proposal, while the Socialists vehemently opposed it.    The coalition leaders only agreed to resume discussion  Saturday afternoon, coalition officials said.    Political analysts pointed to the possibility that the  coalition might try to form a new coalition by integrating some  legislators from the opposition Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]  even at the risk of alienating the SDP.    However, the LDP quickly vowed to block any attempts by the  coalition to win over its legislators and instead to establish a  new coalition government led by itself. [passage omitted]</p>

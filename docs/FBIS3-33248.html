The congressman was kidnapped in Guaviare Department in  southern Colombia by several men who identified themselves as  members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC).    The 63-year-old Devia, a member of the ruling Liberal Party,  is Guaviare's deputy in the Chamber of Representatives and was  campaigning for reelection in the 13 March congressional  elections, according to sources close to him.    Members of the pro-Cuban Army of National Liberation (ELN)  kidnapped Senator Hernando Torres and Deputy Victor Buitrago in  Boyaca Department in central Colombia last weekend. Both men  were also campaigning for reelection.    Meanwhile, government spokesmen pointed out that FARC and  ELN  guerrillas staged a joint attack on the town of Cucutilla, 350  km northeast of Santa Fe de Bogota, where they murdered two  policemen and one soldier and destroyed a bank and the  headquarters of the state Telephone Company (Telecom).    The police disclosed that 12 members of the ELN were  captured  in Antioquia Department in northwestern Colombia during an anti-  kidnapping operation, among them two of the group's alleged  ideologists, sociology students Myriam Giraldo and Fabian Masso.    It has been announced that the guerrillas' arrest marked the  culmination of an operation by the police, who had discovered a  case of self-abduction by a merchant who surrendered to the  subversives to collect a $6 million insurance policy he had  purchased abroad.</p>

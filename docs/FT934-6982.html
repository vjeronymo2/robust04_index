			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / World Bond Markets: New York Already reeling because of a string of recent encouraging economic statistics, US bond prices are likely to come under renewed pressure this week from more economic data and an influx of new supply. The only good news for fixed-income investors is the Thanksgiving holiday, which will shut the market on Thursday and close it early on Friday, at 1pm. They may also be cheered by Monday's release of the latest Federal budget deficit figure, which is expected to show a slight shrinkage in the deficit. Otherwise, the only notable data due is the October durable goods orders report on Wednesday. After September's slight 0.7 per cent rise in durable goods orders, Wall Street is looking for a bigger increase. With sentiment so gloomy, traders are not looking forward to this week's Treasury auctions, which will add supply to the market at a time when prices are vulnerable. Today, the Treasury will sell Dollars 17bn in two-year notes (the largest such issue in history), and on Wednesday it will sell Dollars 11bn in five-year notes. If Friday's fall in prices is carried through into the early part of this week, institutional investors could fear further declines and stay away from the auctions, pushing yields even higher. Thursday's holiday may not come a moment too soon for the bond market.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Provincial CPC Committee Secretary Xie Fei held  talks with persons in charge of some 10 large and medium-sized  state-owned enterprises based in the Guangzhou area on the  mornings of 3 and 4 June. After conscientiously listening to  detailed reports on enterprises production and operations,  product marketing, circulation funds, the transformation of  operational mechanisms, and so on, Secretary Xie Fei asked many  specific questions.    On the morning of 3 June, Secretary Xie Fei held talks with  comrades in charge of a number of light and textile industrial  enterprises based in the Guangzhou area. The comrades in charge  of Guangzhou Bandao Electric Appliances Company, Guangzhou  Baiyunshan Joint-Stock Company Ltd., Guangzhou Huanan Sewing  Equipment Company, and Guangzhou Wuyang Bicycle Company briefed  Secretary Xie Fei on production, operations, and the  transformation of operational mechanisms this year. After being  told that the above-mentioned enterprises have gradually  extricated themselves from a difficult position to varying  degrees, worked out new development strategies in accordance  with the new reform measures introduced by the state since the  start of this year, and achieved initial results in all areas of  endeavor, Secretary Xie Fei said that whether Guangzhou would be  able to maintain the traditional superiority of its light  industry will largely depend on enterprises' reform,  readjustment, and reorganization, as well as the development of  new and quality products. We should make every possible  endeavor to explore a new road to this end.    Speaking of the problems facing enterprises at the moment,  such as heavy burdens, a lack of circulation funds, and so on,  Secretary Xie Fei noted that it is necessary to enhance  determination and redouble efforts in this regard to basically  resolve these problems over the next two years. At present, we  must be determined to seize each and every opportunity to  resolve these problems and make sound and concrete macroeconomic  decisions to this end rather than shouting empty slogans. We  should allocate more human resources to this area of endeavor.    On the morning of 4 June, Secretary Xie Fei held talks with  comrades in charge of a number of heavy industrial and chemical  enterprises based in the Guangzhou area. Comrades in charge of  Guangzhou Iron and Steel Company Ltd., Guangzhou Heavy Machinery  Plant, Guangzhou Petrochemical Plant, Fangcheng International  Joint-Stock Company Ltd., and Guangzhou Paper Company Ltd.  briefed Secretary Xie Fei on their development in great detail.  After listening to the reports, Secretary Xie Fei pointed out  that, by and large, large and medium-sized state-owned  enterprises based in the Guangzhou area have already improved  their operations to a certain extent. This shows that we have  done a lot of work in this area and that these large and  medium-sized enterprises have built a solid basis over the past  decades and are now capable of enduring all types of trials. I  am confident about improving their operations still further in  the years to come. In all senses, large and medium-sized  state-owned enterprises based in the Guangzhou area have always  been in an extremely important position in the province. Given  Guangdong's actual conditions, it is all the more necessary to  maintain a large batch of large and medium-sized enterprises  which can serve as Guangdong's industrial backbone and pillar,  thereby pushing ahead with the province's overall industrial  growth.    Secretary Xie Fei also gave the following three instructions  concerning the development of Guangzhou's large and medium-sized  state-owned enterprises: 1) clearly define property rights  relations and transform large and medium-sized enterprises into  genuine legal entities enjoying operational decisionmaking  powers; 2) establish a strict and scientific enterprise  management system within each large and medium-sized enterprise;  3) Guarantee large and medium-sized enterprises have advanced  production expertise and equipment.    Secretary Xie Fei maintained: So long as we work hard and  strive for new breakthroughs in these three areas,  Guangdong-based large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises  will certainly be able to shake off their heavy burdens, improve  efficiency, and take on a completely new look in the near  future. To achieve this, we must make redoubled efforts to  improve work in this area.</p>

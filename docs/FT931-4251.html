			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Health hearings 'in public' ruling PRESIDENT Bill Clinton seemed unperturbed yesterday at a federal judge's ruling that obliges the task force on US healthcare reform, run by his wife, to conduct some meetings in public, reports Jurek Martin in Washington. Mrs Hillary Rodham Clinton's team was deemed subject to a 1972 law on federal advisory committees that 'information gathering' meetings be open to the public. But sessions for drawing up recommendations and advice to the president were not made subject to public scrutiny. Mr Clinton said this was 'a very good ruling' because it preserved a necessary degree of privacy. The action had been brought by three groups, including a doctors' association created to fight national healthcare. Interest in the case had mostly arisen from the extent to which Mrs Clinton, a power in this administration though not on the payroll, would be compelled to operate in public.</p>

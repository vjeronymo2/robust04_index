			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> AFTER 45 YEARS, A FALLEN SOLDIER FROM THE FIELDS OF FRANCE IS BROUGHT HOME TO  REST  </P> <P> A Georgia soldier killed nearly 45 years ago on the war-torn fields of France  is finally coming home for burial, and his widow hopes she now can put to rest  the haunting memories of their life together.  </P> <P> Theo Wilburn Underwood was a 24-year-old Army private fighting in his first  battle when he was killed Sept. 10, 1944, by a shell that collapsed his  foxhole. Two weeks later the Army notified his 21-year-old pregnant wife,  Ernestine, that he was missing in action.  </P> <P> Theo Underwood was declared officially dead July 20, 1945, but his remains  weren't found until this year, when metal detectors wielded by two French  youths picked up the soldier's helmet. The youths began digging and found the  body, the Army told his widow.  </P> <P> "When someone is missing like that, you have a feeling that it could happen.  And, a lot of times it would run through my mind when I thought about him it  could happen. But you never really expect it to happen," Ernestine Underwood  said recently.  </P> <P> "When it does happen, it's a whole new ballgame. It didn't depress me. It made  me sad," she said of the memories that flooded into her mind when the Army  notified her June 6 that her husband's remains had been found.  </P> <P> The irony of the Army's timing did not escape her. Theo Underwood left New York  City aboard the Queen Mary on June 6, 1944, bound for the battlefields of  Europe.  </P> <P> "He never came out of his first and only battle. I felt like that when the boys  came home in 1945 and 1946, they received recognition. Now, he's coming home 45  years later and I feel like he deserves recognition," she said.  </P> <P> Ernestine Underwood had known all along that her husband was dead. Another  soldier, Dale White of Bluefield, W.Va., saw Underwood buried by the collapsing  foxhole and told her. But, without a grave to visit, it was difficult to let  go.  </P> <P> It also was difficult to convey to her daughters -- one 5 years old when Theo  Underwood died, the other not yet born -- and later, her grandchildren, that he  had truly existed.  </P> <P> "The youngest daughter was born after her father was killed, and she always  wanted a father. So, I think this will give her a father," Ernestine Underwood  said. "I think it will help our three grandchildren. They can say now, 'I do  have a grandfather.' Before, all they had was me talking and pictures.  </P> <P> "It's going to be good for all of us. Because (the remains were) missing, it  took me 7 to 10 years to put him aside. It was kind of hard to do when you  don't have something to hold to or look at and say, this is his grave."  </P> <P> A military funeral is planned for Aug. 11 in Savannah, where Ernestine  Underwood moved after her husband's death. Theo Underwood's cousins, some of  whom are too young to have known him, have asked to be pallbearers, his widow  said.  </P> <P> "He's somebody that the older (cousins) remember and the younger ones have  heard him talked about. He was 6 feet 2, weighed 160 pounds, brown hair, brown  eyes, olive complexion. He was really good-looking. He was the best-looking guy  there (in Jeff Davis County). He captured my heart," she said.  </P> <P> Underwood's widow, who married him at age 14 against both families' wishes,  never remarried. Until recently, she kept a framed 8-by-10 picture of him in  her bedroom. She had to store it, fearing that sunlight would fade it.  </P></p>

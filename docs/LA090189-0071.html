			<p><P> September 1, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> JULIAN'S WATER CONTAMINATED; WARNING ISSUED  </P> <P> With autumn and Apple Days just a few weeks away, the mountain community of  Julian was hit with the second water warning of the year this week.  </P> <P> The county Department of Health Services served notice to Julian residents and  visitors not to drink the water after benzene was found during routine testing  of the water in one of the community's seven wells.  </P> <P> Dan Avera, spokesman for the county health agency, said the contamination was  discovered Aug. 24, and customers of the Julian Community Services District  were advised by mail last Friday and Saturday to use bottled water until  further notice.  </P> <P> Avera said that the benzene-contaminated water does not pose "an acute or  immediate health hazard." However, he said, benzene is listed by the state as a  carcinogen if exposure is long-term.  </P> <P> An investigation is under way into the source of the well contamination, Avera  said, adding that the probable cause is leakage from an underground gasoline  storage tank.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Contamination Has Dropped  </P> <P> Since the well was shut last Thursday, the contamination in the water system  has dropped, Avera said.  </P> <P> Testing will continue, and the well will remain closed until the water is fit  for human consumption.  </P> <P> Several Julian businesses contacted Thursday were unaware of the new  bottled-water advisory.  </P> <P> Pamela Hill, a clerk at the Julian Market, said there was no run on bottled  water at the store.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Tap Water Tastes OK to Me'  </P> <P> A clerk at the Julian Hotel said he thought the hotel served bottled water  routinely to dining room guests, but he added that "the tap water tastes OK to  me."  </P> <P> Earlier this year, Julian-area residents were urged to cut down on water usage  or face mandatory water rationing after community wells, affected by a  three-year drought, were strained to keep up with demand. The voluntary water  conservation advisory is still in effect.  </P></p>

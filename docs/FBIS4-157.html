			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Craig Doonan] </F>   [Text] Durban April 2 SAPA -- The kwaZulu Police [KZP] will  continue its normal policing duties and its members are not  confined to barracks under the emergency regulations, but there  are "uncertainties" about the KZP which have to be clarified by  the minister of justice and of defence. This emerged at an SA  Defence Force [SADF] media briefing in Durban on Saturday [2  April] addressed by Natal Command spokesman Col Frans Verfuss.    "At this stage, they're (KZP) not restricted by the  proclamation.    "No where does (the proclamation) say they're confined to  barracks," he said.    African National Congress President Nelson Mandela said last  week that the KZP would be confined to barracks and would carry  out only those duties permitted by the SADF.    Col Verfuss said there were "uncertainties" regarding the  emergency regulations which had been referred to Justice and  Defence Minister Kobie Coetsee for "clarification". There was a  "bit of a grey area" in terms of the KZP's role, he said,  without elaborating, adding that the KZP would in the interim  continue its normal policing operations.    Col Verfuss explained that KZP Commissioner Lt-Gen Roy  During  had been at Friday's planning session with the SA Police [SAP]  and SADF where the emergency proclamation had been studied.    Col Verfuss refused to elaborate on the "uncertainties" in  the regulations saying these would be made clear by senior  police and army officers next week.    The KZP is not specifically referred to in the regulations  which define "security force" as the SAP or the SADF, or "any  part" of these forces.    On kwaZulu self defence training camps, Col verfuss said the  regulations made it clear that any illegal military or  para-military training was prohibited. He, however, was unable  to say whether action would be taken against the kwaZulu  training camps in Northern Natal and said this would be made  clear next week.    Meanwhile, he revealed that three SADF companies, comprising  up to 500 soldiers, had been deployed on the South Coast,  Midlands and Northern Natal regions over the weekend. These  included two parabat [paratrooper batalion] companies and one  infantry company.    In total, about 1,200 soldiers were now deployed in  Natal/kwaZulu and their daily operations would depend on the  "situation on the ground". "These are troops deployed in an  internal stability/unrest type role and this doesn't include  forces we can call up."    He said citizen forces had, however, been called up for the  election period from April 15 to May 15.    Col Verfuss said current flashpoints around Durban were  Bhambayi, kwaMashu and Ndwedwe. He said troops had been deployed  in these areas and around Margate on the South Coast.    Questioned why he thought violence had recently subsided in  the Natal/kwaZulu region, Col Verfuss said there were "many  reasons". "Probably, the major reason is there's a bit of a  'wait and see' attitude."    He said next week's planned summit between State President F  W de Klerk, Mr Mandela, Inkatha Freedom Party leader Mangosuthu  Buthelezi and Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini may have quelled  fighting. People were also probably waiting to see how the  emergency regulations would affect them.    On illegal weapons in Natal, Col Verfuss said AK-47 assault  rifles were "flowing in on a regular basis", while there were  unconfirmed reports of RPG-7 rocket launchers being smuggled  into the region.    He said licensed weapons would not be confiscated under the  regulations, but there was a ban on carrying other weapons,  including "traditional" ones.</p>

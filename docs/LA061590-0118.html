			<p><P> June 15, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ANIMATION COMPANY RETURNS FOR A 2ND RUN;  </P> <P> ENTERTAINMENT: FILMATION IS BANKING ON MOVIES THAT ITS FOUNDER DESCRIBES AS THE  FURTHER ADVENTURES OF CLASSIC LITERARY CHARACTERS.  </P> <P> The flashy ads announcing an animated movie opening next week have a  bittersweet quality. "Filmation presents 'Happily Ever After,' " the copy  trumpets, with an illustration that depicts Snow White surrounded by seven  little "dwarfelles." Yet Filmation -- for years one of the entertainment  industry's largest animation companies -- shut down its Woodland Hills  production facility on Feb. 3, 1989.  </P> <P> Why has the Filmation name suddenly reappeared on the entertainment scene?  Granted, the animation industry has had a startling turnaround in the past year  or so with the enormous success of "Roger Rabbit" in theaters and "The  Simpsons" on television.  </P> <P> In late 1988, however, when the film was completed, the animation industry was  close to moribund. Things looked even darker when the acquisition of Filmation  by Paravision (a division of the French L'Oreal conglomerate) from Westinghouse  in February of that year seemed to effectively end the company's 25-year  production history. The fate of "Happily Ever After," which features the voices  of Tracey Ullman, Dom DeLuise, Zsa Gabor, Ed Asner and Carol Channing, became  tied to Filmation's then-uncertain future.  </P> <P> Lou Scheimer, Filmation's former president and one of the company's founders,  watched in dismay as the film "seemed to slip through the cracks" during the  complicated negotiations between Westinghouse, Filmation's majority owner, and  Paravision.  </P> <P> An earlier Filmation theatrical film based on a literary property -- "Pinocchio  and the Emperor of the Night" -- had been, according to Scheimer, "considerably  less than a shining financial success." Paravision, with no desire to repeat  the problem, was primarily interested in Filmation's extensive, and largely  unexploited, catalogue of 1,500 half-hour shows; Westinghouse simply wanted to  get out of the animation business.  </P> <P> "When we were in the final negotiations," the 61-year-old Scheimer said. "They  looked at the numbers for 'Pinocchio' and decided 'Happily Ever After' wouldn't  do any better. So they figured, 'Well, we'll give Lou this other turkey as part  of his settlement.'  </P> <P> "But the thing they didn't realize was that 'Happily Ever After' is a much  better picture than 'Pinocchio' was. It's much less pretentious and much more  entertaining."  </P> <P> "We learned our lesson with the 'Pinocchio' experience," said Robby London, now  a vice president at DIC Animation in Burbank and co-author of the script (with  Martha Moran). "We decided to just have a good time with it, without the  moralizing and the message, and I think that's exactly the way it worked out."  </P> <P> Whether the film was good or bad, Scheimer found himself without a company or a  distributor. The vast array of Filmation-produced TV shows -- including "Fat  Albert and the Cosby Kids," "The Archies" and "He Man" -- had become part of  the Paravision catalogue. The very name "Filmation" was only usable by Scheimer  as an adjunct to the title of "Happily Ever After" (reportedly as the result of  a threatened lawsuit that insisted the film be specifically disassociated from  Disney's "Snow White").  </P> <P> "At first," Scheimer said, "I just wanted to get out of the business -- to  retire. But I kept an office open, and I finally took the picture to the  American Film Market where I met this guy from Texas -- Milton Verret. He just  came out of the blue and said 'I want to buy that picture from you.'  </P> <P> "I asked him if he'd ever done anything in the entertainment business before,  and he said, 'no.' He was in the mail order business, estate liquidators --  something like that. I told him, 'You're crazy. This is no business for a  novice.' But he was determined."  </P> <P> "You have to remember," Scheimer said, "that this was just after Filmation had  shut down, and animation was definitely not yet back in vogue. So I figured  selling him the film might be an easy way for me to get out.  </P> <P> "But then Verret started doing things. He made his payments on time. He put  together an interesting campaign to release the film. And, as many problems as  he ran into, he kept finding ways to resolve them."  </P> <P> Scheimer's original game plan, during the halcyon years of the early '80s when  the studio had created a market in syndication for first-run animation with the  original "He Man" series, was to balance television production with a series of  theatrical films.  </P> <P> "Secret of the Sword" and "Brave Starr" -- the first releases -- were both  associated with Filmation television series. "Pinocchio and the Emperor of the  Night" and "Happily Ever After" were the first installments that Scheimer  viewed as a continuing parade of films describing the further adventures of  classic literary characters. Most of those plans were dashed with the sale of  Filmation.  </P> <P> "But when I saw how well Verret was handling 'Happily Ever After,' " Scheimer  said, "I began to think, 'Jeez, if this thing works -- if it finds an audience  -- maybe we can get back to doing more theatricals.' Which is what I wanted to  do all along."  </P> <P> Whether Scheimer gets his opportunity to check on Huck after he gets off the  raft or perhaps experience another undersea adventure with Captain Nemo will  depend on the videocassette and box office response to Snow White's new  escapades with her seven little Dwarfelles.  </P> <P> "The best thing about the current expansion in animation activities," Scheimer  said, "is that it proves there's plenty of room in the business for a number of  players.  </P> <P> "Everybody's been frightened by the fact that Disney's out there, and Fox is  out there. But the audience doesn't care about the company name. They just care  about the property. Is it entertaining or isn't it? That's all. We may be  called Lou Scheimer Productions now instead of Filmation, but if "Happily Ever  After" is as entertaining as I think it is, we'll definitely be back with  more."  </P></p>

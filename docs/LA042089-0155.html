			<p><P> April 20, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MERGER VICTIMS TURN TO 'SWINE' TO HELP BRING HOME THE BACON  </P> <P> Move over, Elks. Look out, Lions. Shriners and Masons, be forewarned: The Swine  Singers are coming. The Loyal Order of Swine Singers, that is.  </P> <P> This is a group that believes misery loves company. The fledgling fellowship --  its initials spell "LOSS" -- is made up of workers whose careers have been  disrupted by corporate takeovers.  </P> <P> "Never try to teach a pig to sing," the Swine Singers advise, noting that  executives rarely listen to those whose company they have taken over. "All you  do is waste your time and annoy the pig."  </P> <P> Who are these people?  </P> <P> The offbeat notion came from a clique of executives in Winston-Salem, N.C., a  region hit hard by buyouts of RJR Nabisco, Piedmont Airlines, Burlington  Industries, Pilot Freight Lines and other companies.  </P> <P> A few months ago, "We were all sitting there crying in our beer and one of us  said, 'Hey -- we've got a lot in common,' " recalled William D. Gardner, a  Swine Singer who left his post with Piedmont after it was taken over by USAir.  </P> <P> What they had in common was the stress and anxiety of uncertain futures because  of corporate restructuring. The executives thought that a society of fellow  sufferers might provide a lighthearted stress release, boost mutual morale  through humor and maybe even lead to a jobs grapevine.  </P> <P> Soon afterward, the first 40 Swine Singers were inducted at a black-tie dinner,  with souvenirs that included rubber pig snouts and T-shirts with a swinish coat  of arms (the fine print says "totus porkus," or whole hog.)  </P> <P> Now, more than 130 people in a handful of cities including Los Angeles; Boston;  New York; Ft. Worth, Tex.; Orlando, Fla.; Lincoln, Neb., and Ft. Wayne, Ind.,  call themselves Swine Singers.  </P> <P> Ceremonies to establish new "sties" -- Swine parlance for chapters -- have been  held in several other cities, including Seattle, Dallas and Clearwater, Fla.  The group has even retained a Winston-Salem public relations firm, McDowell  &amp; Associates, to handle public inquiries.  </P> <P> While currently a loose-knit combination of support group and social network,  the Swine Singers have ambitions. They seek to offer professional job  counseling one day and, perhaps, a relief fund for the human casualties of  restructuring.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Short on Funds  </P> <P> "They don't have a support fund now because they don't have any funds,"  explained spokeswoman June McDowell.  </P> <P> The Swine Singers have their own way of doing things. Members are encouraged,  for instance, to signal each other "with a finger under the nose and a discreet  grunt," according to John Hunter, a founding member, whose own marketing career  has been disrupted by three takeovers.  </P> <P> Hunter added another piece of porcine wisdom that he attributed to Winston  Churchill: "Dogs look up to you. Cats look down on you. Pigs consider you their  equals."'  </P> <P> There is a serious side to all this. Some members, clinging to jobs in  taken-over firms, are so jittery about offending their new masters that they  keep their membership secret.  </P> <P> In fact, the principal founder -- known in some quarters as "His Royal  Swineness" -- remains "in-hog-nito."  </P> <P> "Mergers can take a lot of things away from you -- your authority, your job,"  Gardner declared. "But don't let them take away your sense of humor or your  self-respect."  </P> <P> It is a struggle faced by many these days. More than 1,300 mergers and  takeovers were reported last year, involving more than $457 billion in deals,  according to IDD Information Services in New York.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Nagging Fears  </P> <P> One consequence is that many once-secure managers have a nagging fear that  their jobs can be plucked away if they fail to meet rigorous standards of  performance.  </P> <P> "It used to be that if you made it to vice president of a big, stable American  company, you'd really made it," said Stanley R. Weingart, a psychologist and  senior lecturer at the USC School of Business Administration. "Now it's pretty  iffy. If you don't produce this quarter, you might be out."  </P> <P> When a takeover actually occurs, he said, the stress can be overwhelming: "On a  scale of one to 10 -- with 10 being 'I'm faced with imminent death' -- it's got  to be an eight."  </P></p>

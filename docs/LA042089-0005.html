			<p><P> April 20, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CULINARY SOS: GRILLED TURKEY BREAST WITH A LITTLE MISSISSIPPI MUD PIE ON THE  SIDE  </P> <P> DEAR SOS: Please can you obtain the recipe for grilled turkey served at Border  Grill? It is a wonderful dish and I am an avid turkey eater as I am allergic to  chicken.  </P> <P>  -- JANET  </P> <P> DEAR JANET: We thoroughly enjoyed this grilled turkey dish. During the barbecue  season you may want to grill the meat as the restaurant does and make the sauce  separately, but you may also saute the turkey.  </P> <P> </P> <P> BORDER GRILL VINEGARED GRILLED TURKEY BREAST  </P> <P> 1/2 turkey breast  </P> <P> Salt, pepper  </P> <P> Flour  </P> <P> Butter  </P> <P> 1/2 cup diced red onion  </P> <P> 6 tablespoons vinegar  </P> <P> 1/2 cup chicken stock  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon cracked black pepper or to taste  </P> <P> Slice turkey breast across grain into small escallops. Pound until formed into  thin escallops.  </P> <P> Season turkey to taste with salt and pepper. Lightly flour, shaking off excess.  Grill escallops or saute quickly in about 2 tablespoons butter, but don't  overcook because escallops dry out very quickly.  </P> <P> Heat 1/4 cup butter in skillet. Add onion to pan and saute quickly. Add  vinegar, chicken stock, cracked pepper and salt to taste. Bring to boil. Reduce  heat slightly and cook until sauce is reduced by half.  </P> <P> Cut 2 tablespoons cold butter into small bits and whip into sauce until smooth.  Serve hot turkey slices with vinegared pepper sauce spooned over. Makes 4  servings.  </P> <P> DEAR SOS: Some time ago there was a recipe for Mississippi Mud Pie. I lost it.  Would appreciate it if you could find it.  </P> <P>  -- NELSON  </P> <P> DEAR NELSON: It took some deep-sea diving in our files, but we managed to save  it from a muddy bottom fate. Marriott's Grand Hotel in Point Clear, Ala.,  originally shared the recipe with us.  </P> <P> </P> <P> MISSISSIPPI MUD PIE  </P> <P> 14 cream-filled chocolate cookies  </P> <P> 1/4 cup clarified butter  </P> <P> 1/4 cup used coffee grounds  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon butter  </P> <P> 1 cup dessert whipped topping mix, chilled  </P> <P> 1 1/2 tablespoons instant decaffeinated coffee powder  </P> <P> 1 quart plus 3 cups chocolate ice cream, cooled to 14 to 16 degrees  </P> <P> 1/4 cup coffee liqueur  </P> <P> 1/2 cup chocolate fudge sauce  </P> <P> Place cookies, clarified butter and used coffee grounds into blender container  and blend until thoroughly combined. Pour mixture into buttered 9-inch pie  plate. Spread evenly with spatula. Place piece of plastic wrap over mixture,  top with second pie pan and press firmly to distribute mixture, making certain  bottom and sides are evenly covered. Remove second pan and plastic sheet and  chill shell.  </P> <P> Blend whipped topping mix with coffee powder, stirring until dissolved.  </P> <P> Place chocolate ice cream in thoroughly chilled mixing bowl. Whip at medium  speed with wire whip until smooth, from 2 to 10 minutes.  </P> <P> Immediately add whipped topping mixture and liqueur. Continue whipping on high  speed until mixture thickens, from 2 to 10 minutes, depending on volume. Mound  mixture into chilled pie shell. Immediately place in freezer and freeze 6 to 8  hours.  </P> <P> Quickly cover top of pie with chocolate fudge sauce and return to freezer to  freeze completely. Run thin-bladed knife around edge of crust to loosen from  pan. Cut and serve frozen. Makes 1 (9-inch) pie.  </P> <P> Note: It is important to chill bowl when whipping ice cream and handling  preparations as quickly as possible to prevent melting. Prepare day ahead for  best results.  </P> <P> DEAR SOS: Some time ago you printed a delicious-sounding peanut butter fudge  microwave recipe. Since I don't own a microwave oven I would prefer a recipe  using an ordinary gas stove. Can you help?  </P> <P>  -- MIRA  </P> <P> DEAR MIRA: Certainly and with pleasure, as one peanut butter fudge fan to  another.  </P> <P> </P> <P> PEANUT BUTTER FUDGE  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons butter or margarine  </P> <P> 1 (5.3-ounce) can evaporated milk  </P> <P> 1 2/3 cups sugar  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon salt  </P> <P> 2 cups miniature marshmallows  </P> <P> 1 1/2 cups peanut butter-flavored pieces  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon vanilla  </P> <P> 1 cup semisweet chocolate pieces  </P> <P> Combine butter, evaporated milk, sugar and salt in saucepan. Bring to full boil  over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Cook, stirring, 4 to 5 minutes.  </P> <P> Remove from heat and stir in marshmallows, peanut butter pieces and vanilla.  Stir vigorously 1 minute to melt marshmallows and blend. Pour into buttered  8-inch square pan. Cool.  </P> <P> Melt chocolate pieces and spread over fudge. Chill and cut into squares before  serving. Makes about 2 pounds.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Only recipes of general interest will be printed. We are unable to answer all  requests.

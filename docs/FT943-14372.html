			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / Waigel wants to limit jobless benefits Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, will today present a budget to the cabinet calling for a strict time-limit on the payment of unemployment benefit, and a freeze on the government's net borrowing requirement. The DM485bn (Pounds 195.5bn) budget for 1995 represents a growth rate of just 1 per cent over the current DM480bn spending, thanks to drastic savings enforced on most government departments. The net borrowing requirement will be limited to DM68.7bn, compared with DM69.1bn this year, but the figures were instantly condemned as a 'deliberate deception' by the Social Democrat (SPD) opposition. Mr Waigel's latest assault on the cost of unemployment benefit has been rumoured for weeks, and seems certain to unleash a furious political debate in the run-up to the October general election. In the 1994 budget he reduced unemployment benefit for childless workers from 63 to 60 per cent of previous net earnings for initial benefits, followed by a reduced rate of 53 per cent for the long-term unemployed forever. It is that reduced rate which Mr Waigel now proposes to limit to two years. After that, the long-term unemployed will be reduced to subsistence-related social assistance, resulting in a net saving, in a full year, of DM6.5bn. The move was condemned yesterday by Mr Helmut Wieczoreck, the budget spokesman for the SPD, as 'daylight robbery of the unemployed and the local authorities'. He said it would make no difference to overall public spending, because it simply shifted the burden of support from federally-financed unemployment benefit to local government-financed social assistance. The net borrowing requirement has been kept below this year's DM69bn, in spite of soaring debt servicing costs, by assuming privatisation revenues from the sale of Lufthansa, the national airline, of a net DM1.5bn, and of the Rhine-Main-Danube canal company of DM800m. A further DM5bn will come from the assets of the former East German central bank. A second way of keeping the 1995 borrowing requirement down is to bring forward payments of Germany's oil tax on big companies from February 1996 to December 1995, topping up Mr Waigel's tax revenues by DM2.6bn. The spending plans show that the cost of servicing the soaring federal government debt - which assumes the debts of the Treuhand privatisation agency in eastern Germany from next year - will rise by 38 per cent to DM92.6bn. The Finance Ministry's own budget, which will have to take on continuing running costs of the Treuhand, will more than double, from DM5.8bn to almost DM12bn. In contrast, the Economics Ministry, which pays industrial subsidies and for trade promotion, will see its budget cut by 14.5 per cent. The defence budget, the largest single item at DM47.9bn, has been kept to a growth rate of just 1.4 per cent.</p>

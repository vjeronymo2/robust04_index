(``PHLX'') serve as ex-officio members of the Philadep and SCCP Boards of Directors. The proposed amendments will install the Chief Operating Officer of the PHLX both as an ex-officio member of the Philadep and SCCP Boards of Directors and as the Vice Chairman of the Philadep and SCCP Boards. The proposed amendments will reduce the requisite number of PHLX Governors who must serve on the Philadep and SCCP Boards of Directors from a majority of the fifteen to seventeen Directors to six of the Directors. The proposed amendments will change the term of office for the Boards of Directors for the purpose of qualifying PHLX Governors as Philadep and SCCP Directors. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The intent of this provision is to synchronize the term of office for the Chairman of the Exchange's Board of Governors with his terms of office on the Philadep and SCCP Boards. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Presently, under Article III Section 4(a) of the Philadep and SCCP By-Laws, the Nominating Committee must consist of five ex-officio members of the Board of Directors and two other persons appointed by the Chairman of the Board.

The PHLX will be represented by both senior exchange staff personnel and members of the PHLX Board of Governors, who typically also represent Philadep and SCCP participant firms. In accordance with Philadep's and SCCP's amendment processes delineated in By-Law Article XI, the Chairman of the PHLX Board of Governors, as agent for the sole shareholder and parent corporation, has signed a unanimous consent in lieu of a special meeting to effectuate the foregoing changes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule changes comply with Section 17A of the Act insofar as they will aid Philadep and SCCP in assuring the fair representation of shareholders and participants in the selection of directors and in the administration of affairs. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78q&hyph;1(b)(3)(C) (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B.

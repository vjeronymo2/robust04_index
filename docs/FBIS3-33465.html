			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Sergio Ramirez] </F>   [Text] I have the feeling that as 1994 opens we are on the  verge of some further positive political developments. I am not  going to emphasize the demise of what used to be UNO [National  Opposition Union], which had been expected for months. It is the  future of the national political understanding that I must  discuss.    First of all, it is healthy for Nicaragua that the hub of  consensus-based political decision-making will from now on be  the National Assembly. The blocs that seek to give the country a  stable framework will do a great deal there to further such  stability. We can be sure of that.    Moreover, I do not foresee any new crisis in the Assembly,  like those of recent years, that might hamper or disrupt  national life. The Assembly will operate normally, with equally  normal annual elections of authorities, from now until 1996. We  can also be sure of that.    The Assembly is going to pass the constitutional reforms  before May 1994; they will be substantial and profound and will  be designed to strengthen the system of democratic  participation, the balance between the branches of government,  the judicial system and the electoral system, and the  transparency and integrity of public service.    These reforms will also give the Assembly new functions in  decision-making on fiscal policy and in the ratification of  international financial agreements, as well as in the  appointment of judges, the comptroller, the attorney general,  and a new and much needed post, the attorney general for human  rights.    The idea is not to turn the Assembly into a substitute for  the Executive Branch. That would be preposterous and tactless.  The Executive Branch must preserve intact its powers to run the  government. The idea is, however, that the issues affecting  citizens ought to be aired in the Assembly, the national public  forum par excellence, and that the citizenry ought to know in  advance what is involved when, for example, a tax is going to be  imposed or a commitment signed with a financial body such as the  IMF. These reforms of the constitution will not have to include,  as some would like, express bans on certain individuals holding  public office or running for elected office just because they  have family ties with the president of the republic. As they  have been proposed so far, such bans smack of revenge. And  constitutions cannot be reformed on the basis of first and last  names. This has been one of our past vices and ought to remain  buried in the past.    The National Assembly, with the political consensus of its  deputies, must also make headway in passing laws of great  national significance that have to be enacted in 1994, such as  the Labor Code, the Law of Military Organization, a Tax Code, a  Fisheries Law, and a Law Against Drugs, among others. The  country can be sure that its Assembly will be a political hub, a  hub of consensus, and will pass laws that benefit the nation.    The time has now come to forge national political accords  that have weight and substance. Parties cannot keep on playing  the "thumbs down on him" game or go around threatening to expel  others, as the parties that remain in what used to be UNO are  now doing. That indeed is preposterous. Those who want no  agreement have expelled those who do.    The Christian Democrats showed exemplary courage in deciding  to join the National Assembly when they did. Other parties, the  APC, the MDN [Nicaraguan Democratic Movement], and most of the  deputies of the PSD [Democratic Social Party], are now walking  into the Assembly with their heads held high, aware of what they  are doing. Theirs too is a courageous decision.    Why? Because they are walking in to help the country get  moving, not to continue thwarting and delaying national  solutions. Let those who remain on the outside, screaming and  threatening, stay there. Less and less attention will be paid to  them.    The point now is to work and build. We are starting the year  off on this positive note. And I am sure that it will last and  that it will bear fruit.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, 28 Apr (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--The  relevant department in Beijing has disclosed that preparations  for legal procedures in the Qiandao Lake robbery and murder case  have been completed and a public trial has been scheduled for 10  May in Hangzhou.    During the trial, families of the victims and Taiwan crime  experts will be allowed to attend, and the relevant departments  will report details of the case to the court. A few days ago,  the mainland's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan  Strait invited Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation and relevant  experts to come to Hangzhou before 4 May to listen to reports on  the case.    Hong Kong's WEN WEI PO reported that Beijing's high-level  leadership has paid close attention to the Qiandao Lake case and  has taken it into serious account: it has meticulously attended  to the entire investigation process. When the relevant  department reported the verification of the suspects'  identities, it produced particular evidence which had been  obtained through identifying their fingerprints. Because the  Hairui had been burned and sprayed with water and the scene had  been seriously destroyed, it was very hard to obtain  fingerprints. But after careful checks on the entire ship by  experts, the suspects' fingerprints, which had been left on the  ship when they climbed over from their motorboat, were found.</p>

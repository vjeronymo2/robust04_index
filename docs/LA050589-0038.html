			<p><P> May 5, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> A deliberately set fire broke out in the office of Tehipite Middle School in  Fresno less than 24 hours after a similar fire did extensive damage in the  administration building at the city's Roosevelt High School. Police and fire  investigators said there were similarities in both blazes, but initial  investigation did not reveal links between the incidents. The middle school  fire started in the main office, but firefighters managed to douse the flames  quickly, limiting damage to about $4,500. Investigators said flammable liquid  was poured on several desks and ignited.  </P></p>

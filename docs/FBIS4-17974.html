			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Oleg Panfilov under the "Tajikistan" rubric: </F> "Republic's Foreign Ministry Knows More than Anyone Else: Its  Reports Are More Reminiscent of Intelligence Data"]    [Text] The Tajikistan Foreign Ministry's information  department distributed a number of sensational pieces of news on  25 April. INTERFAX's correspondent reported from Dushanbe  citing department chief Zafar Saidov that according to the  Foreign Ministry (!), "in March-April of this year a  redeployment of armed groupings belonging to the Tajikistan  Islamic Revival Movement has been reported on Afghan territory  in the provinces of Qonduz and Tahar." The Foreign Ministry also  learned that the opposition units have been supplied with food  and transport by General Abdol Basir Haled, commander of the  29th Infantry Division of the Afghan Defense Ministry, and that  in the Tajik province of Badakhshan an opposition armed grouping  of up to 1500 hit-men has been massed under Khadzhi Abdulrashid  Badakhshi, a confectioner (!). The same Zafar Saidov unveiled  the opposition's plans, telling journalists that "the hit-men  are going to reach the territory of the Gornyy Badakhshan  autonomous oblast and to approach the area of the Khaburabad  pass to carry out military operations against Tajikistan  Government forces."    INTERFAX's anonymous military source confirmed that a  breakthrough across the border was planned in the Ishkashim  district of Gornyy Badakhshan. At the command staff of the  Russian Border Troops in Tajikistan it was confirmed that on 23  April guards clashed with three border violators, who were  killed in the ensuing skirmish, in the 2d border post's zone of  action in the Ishkashim district border. On 24 April, another  two intruders were shot dead in the same zone. In the same  breath, the INTERFAX report speaks about an active discussion of  the new draft Constitution, although the text was published only  22 April.    Apart from military information, reports about candidates  for  president should also be expected from Tajikistan. Now it is  known at least that the election campaign has already started  among the population: Names mentioned most commonly include  Supreme Soviet Chairman Emomali Rakhmonov; his first deputy,  Abdumadzhid Dostiyev; Abdumalik Abdulladzhanov, former prime  minister and current ambassador to Russia; and also Major  General Yakub Salimov, internal affairs minister.    There are a number of inconsistencies in the latest reports  of the Foreign Ministry information department. First,  Makhmadsakhi Azizkhonov, chairman of the Ishkashim district,  does not know anything about the armed clash; Badakhshan  administration officials deny it, too. In reality, a resident  of the Ishkashim district told your NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA  correspondent that on 23 April local residents held a rally  outside the building of the district executive committee to  protest bread shortages. Earlier they also complained about the  catastrophic situation with food supplies by sending to Khorog a  telegram, the text of which was published in the local ZINDAGI  newspaper.    Second, the Tajik Foreign Ministry information department  did  not know anything about a KRASNAYA ZVEZDA publication on  Saturday (23 April) that gives -- presumably citing military  intelligence sources -- an absolutely different account of the  strength of opposition hit-men and a different name of the armed  group's commander. Third, the diplomatic ministry has put  itself in a fairly awkward position by divulging unique  information and showing that it is perfectly familiar not only  with the situation in military circles, but also with detailed  plans of the opposition. If this is really so, it turns out  that the Foreign Ministry is engaged in intelligence and  counterintelligence operations, thus assisting the Tajikistan  Security Ministry and the Russian Main Intelligence  Administration.    During the talks between a government delegation and the  opposition that were held in the first half of April in Moscow  an oral agreement was reached that both sides should refrain  from disseminating propaganda. Apparently, the Tajikistan  Foreign Ministry information department has not acceded to the  accord.</p>

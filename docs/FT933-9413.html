			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / International Company News: May stores climbs to Dollars 117m in real terms MAY Department Stores, one of the largest department store operators in the US, yesterday reported an underlying 22 per cent increase in second-quarter earnings per share, at 44 cents, in the three months to end-July. May's actual after-tax profits for the period fell from Dollars 393m to Dollars 117m, but the 1992 results were boosted by a one-off gain of Dollars 298m pre-tax. Had this been excluded, May said second-quarter after-tax profits would have risen from Dollars 95m to Dollars 117m year-on-year. May's sales overall rose from Dollars 2.31bn to Dollars 2.5bn, with Dollars 513m, against Dollars 452m, coming from the Payless ShoeSource division, and Dollars 1.99bn, compared with Dollars 1.86bn, from the department stores. During the quarter, May opened a new Kaufmann's department store in Syracuse, New York, and a net 70 new Payless shoe stores. May, which recently outlined wide-ranging expansion plans, said it would open another 11 department stores during the remainder of 1993, and add about 150 Payless outlets by the end of its current financial year. The second-quarter results mean May's after-tax profits for the first half of the year stand at Dollars 213m, with sales rising to Dollars 4.82bn from Dollars 4.51bn.</p>

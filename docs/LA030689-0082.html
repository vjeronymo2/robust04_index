			<p><P> March 6, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> MOTHER-DAUGHTER LINK FOUND IN OSTEOPOROSIS  </P> <P> Daughters of women with osteoporosis appear to be at increased risk of  developing the bone-thinning disease, Australian researchers reported last  week. Dr. Ego Seeman and his colleagues at the Austin Hospital in Melbourne  compared 32 women whose mothers had osteoporosis to 22 women whose mothers did  not have the disease, which affects roughly 20 million Americans.  </P> <P> In results published in the New England Journal of Medicine, the researchers  found that daughters of osteoporosis patients were more likely to have thinner  bones than daughters of healthy women.  </P> <P> "We conclude that daughters of women with osteoporosis have a reduced bone mass  . . . and this reduction in bone mass may put them at increased risk for  fractures," the researchers wrote.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As noted above, the number of shares of each component in the Index portfolio remain fixed between quarterly reviews except in the event of certain types of corporate actions such as the payment of a dividend other than an ordinary cash dividend, a stock distribution, stock splits, reverse stock splits, rights offering distribution, reorganization, recapitalization, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> similar event with respect to the Index component securities. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a merger or consolidation of an issuer of an Index component, if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the component remains in the Index, the number of shares of that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> component in the Index portfolio may be adjusted, to the nearest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whole share, to maintain the component's relative weight in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Index at the level immediately prior to the corporate action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further, if the Exchange replaces an Index component at a time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other than at a quarterly rebalancing, it will do so in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following manner: if one of the two highest weighted Index  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> components is replaced, the Exchange will determined the weighting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the Index component being replaced and assign the same  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> weighting to the newly added component. If one of the equally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> weighted Index components is replaced, the average dollar value  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the remaining Index components within that tier will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calculated and the resulting figure used to determine the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assigned Index portfolio shares, to the nearest whole share. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  all cases, the divisor will be adjusted, if necessary, to ensure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Index continuity, and the Index will be rebalanced at the next regularly scheduled rebalancing. <FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 12 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Letter from Nathan Most, Senior Vice President, New Products Development, Amex, to Michael Walinskas, Derivative Products Regulation, SEC, dated August 3, 1994, This Letter also withdraws that portion of Amendment No. 3 as it relates to the replacement of Index components.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Amex will calculate and maintain the Index and, pursuant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to Exchange Rule 901C(b), may at any time or from time to time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substitute Index component securities, or adjust the number of components included in the Index, based on changing conditions in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mexico.

As with other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> index options traded on the Amex, the options on the Index will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expire on the Saturday following the third Friday of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  expiration month (``Expiration Friday''). The last trading day in an option series will normally be the second to last business day preceding the Saturday following the third Friday of the expiration month (normally a Thursday). Trading in expiring options will cease at the close of trading on the last trading day.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Index value for purposes of settling a specific Mexico Index option will be calculated based upon the primary exchange regular way opening sale prices for the Index component securities. In the case of NM securities, the first reported sale price will be used. As trading begins in each of the Index's component securities, its opening sale price is used to calculate the Index settlement value. The Index settlement value can be determined once all of the components have opened. If any of the components do not open for trading on the last trading day before expiration, then the prior day's last sale price is used in the Index settlement value calculation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Exchange plans to list options series with expirations in the three near-term calender months and in the two additional calendar months in the March cycle. In addition, longer term option series having up to thirty-six months to expiration may be traded. In lieu of such long-term options on a full-value Index level, the Exchange may instead list long-term, reduced-value put and call options based on one-tenth (1/10th) the Index's full-value. In either event, the interval between expiration months  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  for either a full-value or reduced-value long-term option will not be less than six months.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Eligibility and Maintenance Standards for Index Components  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Exchange has represented that it will ensure that the Index initially and thereafter satisfies the initial listing and maintenance criteria set forth in the Generic Narrow-Based Index Approval Order. In choosing among Index component securities that meet the initial minimum criteria set forth in the Generic Narrow-Based Index Approval Order (as well as Exchange Rule 901C), the Exchange will select components that: (1) have a minimum market value of at least U.S. $75 million, except that for each of the lowest weighted component securities in the Index that in the aggregate account for no more than 10% of the weight of the Index, the market value may be at least $50 million; (2) have an average monthly trading volume in the U.S. markets over the previous six-month period of not less than one million shares (or ADRs) except that for each of the lowest weighted component securities in the Index that in the aggregate account for no more than 10% of the weight of the Index, the trading volume shall be at least 500,000 shares in each of the last six months; (3) have at least 90% of the numerical Index value and at least 80% of the total number of component securities meeting the current criteria for standardized option trading set forth in Exchange Rule 915; and (4) are reported securities that trade on either the NYSE, Amex (subject to the limitations of Rule 901C), or are NM securities. In addition, no individual stock in the Index may represent more than 25% of the Index weight (at the time of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rebalancing) and the five highest weight stocks may not constitute more than 60% of the Index weight (at the time of rebalancing).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

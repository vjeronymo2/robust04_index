			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / Chernomyrdin's price controls are deceptive move: The new Russian prime minister has not yet, as many assumed, proved himself an anti-reformer RUSSIA'S new prime minister raised eyebrows on Tuesday when he announced that price controls would be imposed on a number of basic foodstuffs. Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, many were tempted to conclude, had begun his career as Russian premier in the conservative manner forecast for him. However, the announcement was both weaker than it appeared, and is beside the main point of economic reform of this year. He has not proved himself an anti-reformer yet. First, the main fear of the government is not rising prices but rising unemployment. People have been (relatively) stoic about prices: they are not expected to be when cast adrift from the enterprises and institutions which had guaranteed them a minimum living and a range of social benefits. Mr Feodor Prokopov, the head of the Russian employment service, said yesterday in an interview with a Russian newspaper that while the expected high unemployment rates had not emerged in 1992, 'I fear that this time our forecasts will become reality: the problem of unemployment might emerge as the most serious facing Russia. In 1993 we predict that there will be 5m unemployed'. Coping with this will be hard: while much had been done in setting up employment centres and training programmes, they are untested: and the minimum dole is very close to absolute want. However, at the same time, the government must also make sure the process of privatisation of large companies becomes a reality - a matter which, Mr Chernomyrdin agreed in his speech to business people on Tuesday, was at the heart of the reform process. Mr Anatoly Chubais, the deputy prime minister in charge of privatisation, said on television on Tuesday evening that 'based on the experience we already have (with the first large-scale privatisations) we intend to begin, from the middle of January, mass auctions of big companies throughout Russia'. If unemployment and its discontents are not to overwhelm reform, the state - as President Boris Yeltsin said last month in his speech to parliament - must become stronger. First, it must battle more effectively against crime: figures out yesterday from the interior ministry showed now-familiar but shocking rises, with crime up nearly 30 per cent over the year in Moscow and serious crime up nearly 50 per cent. Mr Chernomyrdin made a feature of that in his speech, too: but the law and order agencies, so good in the past at repression, have yet to become efficient in crime detection. It must also develop an efficient tax collection system: as throughout all of the post-communist world, the post-Soviet states have been strapped for cash because they cannot collect it from their citizens and enterprises in conditions of relative economic freedom. From the first of this month, the tax system has been 'remoulded' towards encouraging investment: 50 per cent of company income which is set aside for investment will be freed from tax, and import duties cut on investment goods and abolished on the necessities, such as grain and medicine. However,the government must also give some concrete signs that it cares. Hence the announcement on price control - though in fact, it amounted only to a slight widening of already existing controls. Mr Chernomyrdin's decree covers bread, macaroni, tea, salt, sugar, milk, butter, meat, children's food and vodka: but these were already controlled where they were produced by monopoly companies (as most were) and are anyway controlled not by absolute price ceilings but by means of a restriction on enterprises profits of between 10 and 25 per cent of sales. It will not cause prices to fall, according to Mr Vladimir Safonov, deputy head of the Price Commission - but would stop 'another jump in prices'. The main cost to the state will be - as it already is - in bread subsidies, running at between Rbs2-3bn a day, in order to keep the breads price at or below Rbs48 a kilo. Little more can be subsidised unless the budget is bust: and, as Mr Alexander Pochinok, chairman of the parliament's budget committee, noted yesterday, the government has submitted no law on extra subsidies to the parliament and the present budget contains no room for such extra spending. Mr Pochinok said that estimates of the total budget for this year would be between the astonishingly wide margins of Rbs30,000bn and Rbs50,000bn: he forecast a deficit of between 6 per cent and 7 per cent of gross domestic product by the year end. Total subsidies planned for 1993 would probably exceed Rbs1,000bn, Mr Pochinok said. Bread subsidies alone would cost between Rbs2bn and Rbs3bn a day. Russian budget deficits are imprecise matters: but if Mr Chernomyrdin and the cabinet he inherited from Mr Yego Gaidar is to remain in charge of finances, it must be controlled. This will be the major constraint: Mr Chernomyrdin is in no different position from his predecessor, and so far shows every sign of knowing it.</p>

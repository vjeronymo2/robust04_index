			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / BA-USAir decision by Christmas US aviation authorities will make a decision before Christmas on whether to let British Airways acquire a large minority stake in USAir, the sixth-largest US carrier. Mr Andrew Card, US transportation secretary, said yesterday the decision-making process would be an open one. He has instigated a formal 'comment' period, which allows interested parties to submit their views by November 27. Comments in response would then be due by December 11 and Mr Card's ruling would be made by December 24. The department has already received considerable correspondence on the issue  -not least from the 'Big Three' US airlines, which oppose the deal. The correspondence will be placed on public file, and the department has ordered both British Airways and USAir to do the same with information they have already provided to it. The department said the deal 'would result in changes in USAir's operations, financial structure and management', and raised the question of whether the airline would 'continue to operate under the control of US citizens'. The final decision will be made by Mr Card, despite the impending change in presidential administrations. During the election campaign President George Bush and Governor Bill Clinton voiced differing views on the deal, which involves a Dollars 750m (Pounds 483.8m) British Airways investment in USAir. The president was carefully non-committal about the transaction's overall merits, although he had previously favoured more foreign investment in US airlines. But Mr Clinton said during a TV chat show that he had 'real problems with it'. 'We get no access to the British market if we do it,' he said but, in response to a further question, replied that he would not 'sign off' on the deal.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Oleksandr Moroz, chairman of the Supreme Council of  Ukraine, and Daniel Kaufmann, chairman of the World Bank's  regional office, held a meeting at the latter's request devoted  to issues of investing foreign capital in Ukraine's economy.    As is known, the World Bank unites 180 countries and  annually  draws up over 100 projects in the privatization sphere, reform  of entrepreneurship, and the development of the private sector.  Ukraine was admitted to this organization in 1992.    The chairman of the World Bank's regional office acquainted  Oleksandr Moroz with his activities in Ukraine. Daniel Kaufmann  said that already now the World Bank can annually allocate 1  billion dollars to Ukraine. However, for this purpose the  Ukrainian side should make a decision on the legal protection of  foreign investments.    The Supreme Council chairman and World Bank representative  exchanged opinions concerning the state of the Ukrainian economy  and possible projects. According to Oleksandr Moroz, the  drawing up of a program for stabilizing Ukraine's economy is  nearing completion. This program, called Trud [Labor], is being  devised with the participation of qualified specialists who were  not involved in such projects before. Great hopes are pinned on  the Supreme Council of Ukraine standing Commission for Issues of  Economic Reform, which consists of businessmen and specialists  in the market relations sphere.</p>

			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / St Petersburg sounds the alert on wages INDUSTRIAL managers in St Petersburg, Russia's second largest city, yesterday warned of an explosion of worker discontent unless the government gave them Rbs2bn to pay wages for March. The rumblings from St Petersburg, a centre of support for both Lenin in 1917 and for Mr Yeltsin during last August's coup, is the latest of a series of angry signals bombarding the Russian government as it tries to push through austerity policies. Mr Gennady Burbulis, first deputy prime minister, said yesterday a government commission would go to the Kuzbass mining area, where bus drivers and teachers have threatened a strike unless they receive pay rises equal to the tripling of miners' pay. Meanwhile Mr Alfred Malinovsky, chairman of Russia's pilots' union, said 70 per cent of pilots were prepared to strike on March 25 unless demands for a pay rise and better working conditions were met. Mr Viktor Kharchenko, chairman of the Union of Industrial Enterprises, which groups about 30 of St Petersburg's biggest state enterprises, said managers already owed Rbs18bn to banks. Mr Kharchenko, who also heads the Baltic Shipping Company, said defence enterprises accounting for 70 per cent of the city's heavy industry should be allowed to export arms to help them survive. The dilemma of Mr Vyacheslav Petrov, manager of the Arsenal artillery plant, is typical of the problems facing defence plants around the country as a result of a cut in military procurement to 13 per cent of last year's level. Mr Petrov borrowed Rbs30m from the bank in February to pay wages and make up for the fact that several customers had failed to pay for deliveries. Talks with potential foreign investors on helping him convert more of his defence output to civilian uses have produced no results. 'Time will run out before they wake up,' he said. Unless he gets funds from the state, Mr Petrov will have to sack some of his 3,500 workers involved in defence production. Another 5,500 people are already involved in the production of consumer goods at his factory thanks to partial conversion. But even conversion is not necessarily a key to salvation. The mighty Kirov plant, which over recent years has managed to switch from tanks to tractors, is unable to sell its tractors for lack of key components. This shortfall is just one symptom of the disruptions in deliveries between factories, despite a variety of government incentives to facilitate the output of agricultural machinery. A shortfall in steel production has led to predictions of a 30 per cent fall in the output of tractors and other agricultural equipment. THE pro-Russian commander of the Black Sea fleet yesterday condemned the decision by 58 officers and seamen aboard one of the fleet's biggest battle cruisers to swear allegiance to Ukraine, writes Chrystia Freeland in Kiev. A spokesman for Admiral Igor Kasatonov said the oath, taken on Sunday, had been instigated by the deputy commander of the battleship Admiral Kutuzov in the absence of the commander. 'We consider such acts to be impermissible and a destructive force,' he said. The oath, taken by less than half the 136 serving officers and men aboard, defied a ban by Admiral Kasatonov against any swearing of allegiance to Ukraine until Russian and Ukraine leaders have resolved the status of the fleet. Ukrainian claims to the fleet have collided with Russia's insistence that the bulk of the force remain under the collective control of the Commonwealth of Independent States. The Ukrainian government has urged Admiral Kasatonov's dismissal.</p>

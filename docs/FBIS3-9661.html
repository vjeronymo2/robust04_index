These talks, which began 22 March, were  adjourned because of additional consultations by both sides and  consideration of the proposals which emerged during the talks.    Today's talks are being attended for the first time by  Charles Redman, the special envoy of the U.S. President.  Vitaliy Churkin, special envoy of the Russian president, and  U.S. Ambassador to Croatia Peter Galbraith were also taking  part. The Croatian delegation comprises Engineer Hrvoje Sarinic,  Slavko Degoricija, Gen Petar Stipetic, Naval Captain Davor  Domazet, Smiljana Reljic and Budimir Pleskina. The Serbs from  the UNPA zones are being represented at the talks by Dusan  Rakic, Slobodan Jarcevic, Mile Novakovic, and Aco Draca.    The meeting in the Russian Embassy is being chaired by  representatives of the international conference on the former  Yugoslavia, ambassadors Geert Ahrens and Kai Aide. The only  subject of the talks, it has been announced, will be an  agreement on a cease-fire and in this connection the separation  of forces.</p>

			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Tate pays Pounds 1.1m to former chief Tate &amp; Lyle, the sugar and sweeteners group, disclosed yesterday that it paid Pounds 1.1m in compensation to Mr Stephen Brown, its former chief executive, who left the company in March. The compensation package - based on Mr Brown's three-year rolling contract on a basic salary of about Pounds 300,000 a year - was agreed after he failed to resolve differences over management style with Mr Neil Shaw, chairman. As part of the payment, Mr Brown received Pounds 567,000 from Tate &amp; Lyle and a further Pounds 515,000 from the group's subsidiaries. The former chief executive is also understood to have received Pounds 285,000 from the disposal in July of a house in Kensington, west London. Tate &amp; Lyle had a 70 per cent stake in the property, while Mr Brown held the remainder. According to the company's annual report, the house was sold for Pounds 950,000 just over a year after they purchased it jointly for Pounds 900,000. The property disposal and compensation payment marked the end of what analysts described as an embarrassing period for Tate &amp; Lyle. Mr Shaw, who split the roles of chairman and chief executive in April 1992 to make way for Mr Brown, said it was clear after less than 12 months that their relationship 'wasn't working'. Since the chief executive's departure, the group has been overseen by an executive committee comprising four divisional directors, the finance director and chair-man. The share price closed up 2p at 397p.</p>

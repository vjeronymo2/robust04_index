			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Predictive value of references not all that it is claimed to be Sir, Richard Donkin, on the predictive value of references (Management, August 3), quotes the director general of the Institute of Personnel and Development as saying: 'The best predictor you can get of the likely success of a candidate is how they performed in their previous jobs . . . It is better than the interview, the psychometric test and all the other devices.' This is highly misleading. 'How they performed' would be wonderful if you could find out, but references can be glowing to get rid of the unwanted (and the opposite). Research has found that references are well below psychometric tests on average, and at about the same pathetic level as the average interview.

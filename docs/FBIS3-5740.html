			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 10 KYODO -- Vice Defense Minister  Shigeru Hatakeyama said Thursday [10 March] it is possible that  North Korea has developed a long-range missile capable of  hitting targets more than 2,000 kilometers away.    "North Korea has placed stress on its military. Looking at  the facts that it has developed the Nodong-1 through upgrading  Scud missiles and has improved its technologies, we cannot  totally deny that it may produce a further upgraded one," he  said.    Hatakeyama, speaking at a news conference, discussed a  report  by the authoritative JANE'S DEFENSE WEEKLY that North Korea is  developing two new ballistic missiles, one of which is capable  of landing anywhere in Japan. Pyongyang last year test-fired  the Nodong-1 ballistic missile with an estimated range of 1,000  kilometers -- capable of striking Seoul and western parts of  Japan.    Hatakeyama, however, said the Defense Agency has not  independently confirmed the JANE's report. According to JANE's,  U.S. intelligence satellites have detected a new "missile  simulator," a hardware mock-up of a missile, at the Sanum Dong  research facility in North Korea.    The weekly said the new two-stage missile has been given the  provisional designation Taepo Dong-2 (TD-2) by U.S.  intelligence. The mock-up was 32 meters long, comprising an 18  by 2.4 meter diameter first stage and a 14 by 1.3 meter second  stage rocket.    The TD-2's dimensions indicate the missile would have a  range  far greater than the 2,000 kilometers of the Taepo Dong-1  (TD-1), also under development by North Korea, the magazine  said. Jane's said U.S. officials also believe the missile has a  much improved targeting capability and is possibly able to  achieve a range of 3,500 kilometers, putting it in striking  distance of Guam.</p>

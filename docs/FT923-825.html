			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Fashion: Masters of the sweater game HAND-KNITTED sweaters are one of the great collectables. Many designers bring out a new - and, of course, 'exclusive' - creation every year which aficionados simply MUST have. From Ralph Lauren to Krizia, it has proved a masterly way of persuading their followers that last year's sweater simply will not do and another investment has to be made. Joseph, of Joseph Tricot fame, has a knack of making any of his designs a must-have. The year of the rose-embellished sweater saw most fashionable girls around town prepared to do without almost everything else provided they could raise the Pounds 250 the garments cost. Joseph's fans might like to know that this year's collectables sport either a Moroccan theme or the perennially popular rose. Such are the hard times that prices remain around the Pounds 250 mark. At Ralph Lauren, this year's themes are reindeers and snowflakes. Those with around Pounds 460 to spare seem to think the investment worthwhile. Jamie &amp; Jessica Seaton are another of the big names. They started by making richly-coloured, intricately hand-knitted sweaters but found the market was limited, not only by price but also by the numbers they could produce. For all who have longed for one of their designs, but have not been able to afford it, they now sell 11 of them in kit form. This means that anybody with the skill and patience to tackle the knitting themselves can have a J. &amp; J. Seaton sweater for a fraction of the usual price. The kits vary from Pounds 42 to Pounds 69 for the most elaborate, and designs range from roses to diamonds and tigers. All look - and are - special. For a folder with coloured photographs of the complete range, write to J. &amp; J. Seaton, Goetre, Llanfynydd, Carmarthen, Dyfed SA32 7TT. The ready-made versions are available at prices from Pounds 250 to Pounds 500 at exclusive shops up and down the UK. In the West End of London, these include Liberty of Regent Street and Browns of South Molton Street.</p>

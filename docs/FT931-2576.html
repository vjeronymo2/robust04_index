			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Yorkshire TV talk Strong rumours that Granada Group is poised to buy a near-20 per cent stake in Yorkshire Television set the broadcasting sector alight with takeover talk and sent Yorkshire TV's shares smartly forward. Analysts said they believed that Granada was negotiating with WH Smith for its Yorkshire TV stake, with a Pounds 16m price tag being mooted. Under present legislation there is a 20 per cent ceiling on a shareholding in television franchise comapanies and a moratorium on full-blown bids until the end of the year. A Granada move into Yorkshire TV would fit in well with the former's strategy of expanding its television interests, which privately it has said would include buying other broadcasting groups. Granada tumbled initially yesterday as NatWest Securities suggested problems ahead over the group's large pension fund surplus. However, the Yorkshire TV stake talk lifted sentiment and the shares finished only a net 4 off at 366p. Yorkshire TV shot forward on the speculation, the ordinary shares reaching 172p before ending 8 up at 165p. WH Smith 'A' relinquished 10 to 440p.</p>

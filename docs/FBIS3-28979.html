National Security Council [NSC] Secretary General Charan  Kunlawanit said the Chinese Embassy counsellor called on him at  Government House yesterday to express his government's "concern"  about Mr. Li's visit which will begin on Monday.    He said he told the Chinese envoy that the visit was private  and had nothing to do with any state agencies, including the  NSC. The invitation was extended to the Taiwanese president by  the Thai private sector, and the visit was, therefore, not  recognized by the government.    Gen. Charan said the Chinese envoy was concerned that the  visit, although private, might affect good relations between  Thailand and China. He said he assured the envoy of Thailand's  strict adherence to the one-China policy and asked him not to  worry too much. He said he was not aware of the full details of  Mr. Li's itinerary except for a vacation in Phuket. [passage  omitted]    Gen. Charan said he exchanged views with the embassy  counsellor about regional cooperation on narcotics suppression.    Foreign Minister Squadron Leader Prasong Sunsiri said that  no  Thai cabinet ministers would meet the Taiwanese president either  in their official or private capacities. He said he had no plan  to meet Mr. Li, and would turn down such a request if one was  put to him. [passage omitted]    Asked if there was any possibility of the Taiwanese  president  discussing economic issues with economic ministers, Sqn. Ldr.  Prasong said "no."    The minister said he did not pay attention to details of the  visit when asked if he knew how many days Mr. Li would stay in  Thailand.    Government Spokesman Aphisit Wetchachiwa stressed the  private  nature of President Li's trip, and said Thailand was a free  country open to visitors. The spokesman said there was  substantial business activity between Thais and Taiwanese, and  that a large number of Thais were working in Taiwan.</p>

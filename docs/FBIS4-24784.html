			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By XINHUA reporter Wu Lan (2976 1526) and SHANXI RIBAO </F> reporter Du Tianwei (2629 1131 1218)]    [Text] Taiyuan, 31 May (XINHUA) -- Accompanied by Hu  Fuguo, secretary of the Shanxi provincial party committee; Lu  Gongxun, chairman of the provincial people's congress standing  committee; and Vice Governor Guo Yuhuai, Tian Jiyun, member of  the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and vice chairman of  the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, went  down to the fields and construction sites in Yangquan, Jinzhong,  Taiyuan, Xinzhou, and other prefectures and cities for  on-the-spot inspections from 28 to 31 May. After hearing the  work briefing by responsible comrades, he noted that Shanxi must  stabilize the agriculture through all possible means and promote  the development of village and town enterprises as well as coal  production.    On 28 May, Tian Jiyun and his party came to Dazhai Village  in  Xiyang County. He ascended the Hutou Shan with great interest  and carefully inspected the Dazhai-type fields which decorated  the slopes with gullies and ridges. This is the fourth time he  ascended the Hutou Shan and he asked Guo Fenglian, secretary of  the Dazhai Village party branch, about the production situation  in recent years. On his third visit to Dazhai in March 1992,  few changes were apparent in Dazhai despite over 10 years of  reform and opening up. He was discouraged to find out that  Dazhai still basically relied on agriculture and the per capita  income was only 600 yuan. He encouraged the Dazhai people to  "emancipate their minds, renew their concepts, widen their  roads, and strive for a comfortable life with concerted efforts"  at that time. Two years passed, and he saw a great change in  the spirit and appearance of the Dazhai people when he came here  again -- Dazhai Village has taken a new step in reform and  opening up and promoted its economic development to a new level;  it has not only further developed agriculture, but has also  built a shirt factory, a woolen sweater factory, a cement  factory, and started a transportation service. Last year, the  village's total income exceeded 10 million yuan for the first  time; of this, non-agricultural income accounted for 93.6  percent, and per capita income reached 1,350 yuan. Tian Jiyun  smiled with delight. He said: Within merely two years, the  Dazhai people have paid attention to industrial and sideline  production, reaped bumper grain harvests, and flourished in  second and tertiary industries after ensuring grain production.  This is a correct path. To construct a new Dazhai, it is  necessary to adhere to the theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics, and shift one's thinking and concepts  from a planned economy to a market economy, as well as from a  product economy to a commodity economy. Developing agriculture  by merely concentrating on the production of one single kind of  grain can only feed the people; in such a case, people will not  eat well, much less become prosperous. He hoped that Dazhai,  the red flag that has once been fluttering on the agricultural  front of China, would make some achievements in the spring tide  of the market economy and that a number of new Dazhais that  integrate agriculture, industry, and trade for the overall  development of agriculture, forestry, husbandry, sideline  production, and fishing and that are constructed on the basis of  a commodity economy would emerge in Xiyang County, Jinzhong  Prefecture, and Shanxi Province. He once again encouraged the  Dazhai people to "construct a socialist new Dazhai and restore  their past heroic style with new ideas and concepts and on new  roads and a basis. [quotation mark as received]    During his visit in Shanxi, Tian Jiyun inspected the  terminal  of the Taiyuan Airport, which was still under construction, and  the construction site for the elevated waiting-room of Taiyuan  Train Station. He praised the landlocked Shanxi's method of  strengthening infrastructure construction to promote opening up.    After hearing the work briefings by the provincial party  committee, provincial people's congress, and provincial  government, Tian Jiyun noted: The idea of three foundations  (agriculture as the foundation of the economy, infrastructure,  and basic industries) and four emphases (coal mining, power  supply, water diversion, and road maintenance) proposed by  Shanxi tallies with the actual situation in Shanxi and is very  correct. He hoped that Shanxi would stabilize agriculture  through all possible means and develop village and town  enterprises as well as coal production. When Tian Jiyun was  informed that this year was Shanxi's most difficult time in coal  production and other provinces had defaulted on 8 billion yuan  for Shanxi's coal and freight, he said: Stabilizing coal  production is as important as stabilizing agriculture for  Shanxi. Only by revitalizing coal production can Shanxi  revitalize the economy. Therefore, the difficulties and problems  of the coal industry must be resolved through all possible means  to boost coal production.    Speaking on the work of the people's congresses, Tian Jiyun  said: Improving legislation and ruling the country by laws are  not only necessary for the practice of a socialist market  economy, but also a must for ensuring the state's long-term  peace and stability. Therefore, people's congresses at all  levels must conscientiously do a good job in legislation and  supervision over law enforcement.</p>

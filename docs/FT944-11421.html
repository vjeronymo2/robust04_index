			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Bosnia peace effort under threat after fresh clashes The upsurge in fighting between Bosnian government forces and their Serb enemies is threatening the uneasy alliance between Russia and its western partners, formed to promote peace in the region. The 12-day-old flare-up in the conflict is also threatening to shatter the tattered ceasefire in the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo. The UN warned yesterday that renewed fighting posed a serious threat to the welfare of the 300,000 civilians in the city and called on both sides not to deploy heavy weapons. 'Sarajevo remains an exclusion zone in which the use of big guns could be subject to air strikes,' a UN official said. The warning followed an overnight incident in which Nato aircraft buzzed the city in order to defuse a rapidly escalating confrontation between Bosnia's Moslem-led army and the Bosnian Serbs. Diplomats from the US, Russia, the UK, France and Germany - the five-nation contact group working on a peace settlement for Bosnia - met senior UN and Croatian officials in Zagreb yesterday. They were told by Croatian officials that there was little immediate prospect of halting the fighting. The group's unity has been strained by the fighting, with the US defending the Bosnian army's offensive and Russia condemning it. Tensions are likely to grow if the conflict escalates. Up to 10,000 residents of Sarajevo were killed - mainly by Serb artillery shells - before the establishment nine months ago of an exclusion zone in which heavy weapons were either withdrawn or placed under UN supervision. However, the situation in the capital, which relies on UN relief flights for food and other essentials, has deteriorated since August when the Serbs partly reimposed their blockade. The weekend fighting was the latest sign that the ability of the UN's lightly armed troops to protect the civilian population from the consequences of war, and guarantee their own safety, is diminishing steadily. The fighting began when the Bosnian army opened fire with mortars on Serb-held territory near Sarajevo, provoking Serb artillery fire on the Moslem suburb of Hrasnica. Bosnian government infantry then advanced. Last night the Bosnian army claimed it had captured 30 villages in two days of fighting just to the north of Sarajevo. In northern Bosnia, the Bosnian Serb forces said they had fought off a threat to the town of Bosanska Krupa and regained some of the ground they had lost over the past week. The Serb-dominated Yugoslav government in Belgrade issued a statement at the weekend condemning the 'deliberate and massive violation of the ceasefire agreement on the part of Moslem and . . . Croat forces'. However, the statement contained no suggestion that Belgrade's embargo against the Bosnian Serbs, its former allies, would be lifted. Editorial Comment, Page 19</p>

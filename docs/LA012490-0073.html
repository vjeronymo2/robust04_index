			<p><P> January 24, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Poland Cannot Meet Interest Payments: Poland said it cannot meet first-quarter  interest payments on its commercial bank debt because of balance of payments  difficulties, British bankers said.  </P> <P> Poland, with foreign debts of about $40 billion, should have paid about $180  million on its medium-term rescheduled debt in the first quarter of this year.  But it has missed a $70-million payment that was due Monday, the bankers said.  Poland owes Western commercial banks $9 billion, of which about $1 billion is  in short-term trade credits.  </P></p>

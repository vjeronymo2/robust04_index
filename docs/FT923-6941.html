			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / BP may close Welsh chemicals plant BRITISH Petroleum Chemicals is thought to be considering closing at least one plant in its Baglan Bay petrochemicals complex in south Wales. Up to 1,900 workers are employed at the complex at any one time. Internal BP documents argue the European petrochemicals industry is suffering from chronic overcapacity. It says the sector must 'adopt rapid decisive measures or face slow death'. The European industry is suffering from overcapacity of as much as 2m tonnes a year of ethylene, the basic building block of petrochemicals. No significant manufacturer is presently making profits. Mr Bryan Sanderson, chief executive of BP Chemicals, the subsidiary of the oil group, said in an interview this week that if there was a rationalisation of the industry, Baglan Bay would be 'clearly our marginal site'. The complex, near Port Talbot, is the second largest employer in the region and provides work for 900 employees and between 500 and 1,000 contractors. In May, the company ended recognition of unions at Baglan Bay. One option identified by BP is to close a 120,000-tonne per year ethylene unit at the site. The unit supplies BP's low density polyethylene plant at Antwerp which the group said this week is being sold to Neste Chemicals, the acquisitive state-owned Finnish company. BP has signed a contract to continue to supply the Antwerp plant, but has not given details of its duration or size. If BP closes a second ethylene unit at Baglan Bay, the future of the whole site would be at risk. The ethylene units supply a 270,000-tonne-a-year styrene plant which in May was incorporated in a joint venture with Enichem of Italy. Other derivative plants manufacture vinyl acetate, ethanol and isopropyl alcohol. The Baglan Bay site also contains a 50kw electricity generator.  Mr Jeff Morgan, branch secretary of the TGWU, said: 'What we fear is that BP has safeguarded the styrenes part of the site through the merger (with Enichem). The power station is also viable. But it is very difficult to say whether the ethylene business and alcohols can sustain themselves,' he said.</p>

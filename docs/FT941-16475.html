			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / Fledgling central bank faces struggle: Obstacles remain to acceptance of EMI as monetary force in Europe There are growing signs that the president of the European Monetary Institute, Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy, will have a struggle to get the organisation accepted as a significant force in European monetary affairs. The institute's council holds its inaugural meeting in Frankfurt tomorrow with difficult questions over the pay and conditions of the staff yet to be resolved. There are also differences among the European central banks, who own the institute, over how far jobs should be allocated on grounds of nationality. More fundamentally, there are wide divergences between authorities such as the European Commission and Belgian finance ministry, which see the EMI as an instrument to force integration in the EU, and others, notably the Bank of England and Bundesbank, which think its role should be mainly advisory. Last week, the Greek government, which took over the presidency of the European Union at the new year, cast doubt on the status of the EMI. Mr Yannos Papantoniou, the alternate economy minister who will chair meetings of EU economics and finance ministers until the end of June, said he doubted whether Mr Lamfalussy would be invited to the monthly meetings of 'Ecofin' ministers on a regular basis. Senior European monetary officials say the Greek threat is one of Mr Lamfalussy's lesser problems. The EMI's statutes make clear that Mr Lamfalussy can expect to attend ministerial meetings when the functioning of the European monetary system or broad macro-economic issues are being discussed - which will be the case with most of them. The officials consider the first two meetings of the EMI council will be a significant test of Mr Lamfalussy's influence. But it will only become clear around mid-year, when key staff have been recruited, whether the EMI will play an important role in EU monetary policy. Mr Lamfalussy, a Hungarian-born Belgian banker, is having to build the institute from small beginnings. He has to recruit four or five key people soon, including a director-general and department heads. Meanwhile, many of the officials who served the EMI's forerunner - the Basle-based EC central bank governors' committee - are returning to their national central banks at the end of three-year secondments. Officials say the EMI has 'hundreds of candidates' for senior posts, mainly nominated by EU central banks, but they cannot be selected until the terms and conditions of employment are fixed. Among unresolved questions are whether non-German officials should be given expatriate allowances as an inducement for living in Frankfurt or whether there should be some other form of dislocation allowance for new employees of the institute that does not discriminate against Germans. Mr Lamfalussy will have to fight for conditions that are good enough to attract high quality staff to the EMI. The EU central banks believe the EMI should be kept on a tight budgetary rein so that there is no suspicion of the extravagant behaviour that marked the start-up of the London-based European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. In the meantime, Mr Lamfalussy is unable to provide the officials to chair the various EMI sub-committees responsible for guiding the current second stage of European economic and monetary union. A key test of the EMI's status will be whether his staff take over such duties when it is properly operational later this year. Although tough battles lie ahead, Mr Lamfalussy has one thing in his favour; he was asked to do the job of EMI president. As long as the majority of EU states are committed to Emu, they have a vested interest in ensuring that the EMI plays a constructive part in the process even though the Maastricht Treaty is vague about the institute's precise role.</p>

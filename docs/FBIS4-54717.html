			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague May 4 (CTK) -- Two Czech opposition parties,  the Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia (KSCM) and the  Liberal National Social Party (LSNS), will have to leave the  publishing ventures in which they are shareholders, the Czech  agricultural daily ZEMEDELSKE NOVINY writes today.    On April 29, parliament approved a bill forbidding political  parties and movements from raising money other than through  membership fees, gifts, loans and credits, and lease of  property. The KSCM owns a majority stake in Futura, a company  which publishes HALO NOVINY, and the LSNS owns 93 percent of  shares of Melantrich, a company publishing the daily SVOBODNE  SLOVO. KSCM spokeswoman Vera Zezulkova says that the KSCM will  respect the law and is already taking steps to comply with it  but may still appeal against it at the Constitutional Court, the  paper writes. The law on political parties gives them until  June 1, 1995, to comply.    "The KSCM considers the law to be discriminatory against the  opposition parties," Zezulkova says, adding that another point  the party is taking to courts is the redistribution of state  subsidies to political parties, which she says "has altered  election results and ignored the voters." "The situation is  ripe for early elections," Zezulkova says in ZEMEDELSKE NOVINY.    The future of the LSNS' stake in Melantrich will only be  decided at an LSNS conference to be held in April or May 1995,  the paper quotes LSNS Political Secretary Jaroslav Jurkovic as  saying. One of the ways out might be to distribute the 42,000  shares among the party members, Jurkovic says, recalling a  similar move by the Czechoslovak Socialist Party after the  Second World War, when the party gave out Melantrich shares to  "reliable members." The LSNS will not lose its grip on the  orientation of SVOBODNE SLOVO, Jurkovic says in ZEMEDELSKE  NOVINY.</p>

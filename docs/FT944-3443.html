			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Pounds 4.39m losses rule out final dividend from JFB Johnson &amp; Firth Brown, the specialist engineering group, yesterday failed to declare a dividend for the first time in 10 years after heavy restructuring costs and subdued demand undermined its results for the year to September 30. Reporting pre-tax losses of Pounds 4.39m against profits of Pounds 3.06m, the group said it would concentrate on improving the performance of its core forging and light engineering activities rather than use reserves to pay dividends. A total of 1.35p was paid last time. Although Mr Martin Llowarch, chairman, said the group was anxious to restore dividend payments, he ruled out such a move following a year in which the company lost Pounds 2.49m on the disposal of six light engineering subsidiaries and incurred further restructuring costs of Pounds 1.47m. 'A lack of volume and reduced profits contributed to the poor results,' he said. 'And we had difficulty seeing where the light engineering companies were going.' Operating profits, including a Pounds 64,000 loss on discontinued operations, fell from Pounds 4.83m to Pounds 1.54m on turnover virtually unchanged at Pounds 130.1m. Firth Rixson, the group's UK forging and alloy business, reported profits down from Pounds 2.8m to Pounds 2.1m, while profits at its remaining light engineering businesses fell from Pounds 1.04m to Pounds 106,000. Even so, Mr Llowarch said the company had seen orders increase 30 per cent in recent months and both divisions were now enjoying healthy profits growth. He warned, however, that the businesses could come under margin pressure under the impact of raw material price increases, particularly for steel. To counter such increases, he said the group would use provisions of Pounds 750,000 to reorganise Firth Rixson's North American activities - mainly supplying aircraft engine manufacturers - and impose stricter controls on the light engineering businesses. Gearing was unchanged at 36 per cent, although the Pounds 6.25m raised from the sale of non-core businesses helped reduce net borrowing from Pounds 18.2m to Pounds 16.5m. Losses per share came out at 3.6p (earnings of 1.4p).</p>

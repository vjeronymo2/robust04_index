			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Power, real costs of gas and pool prices (2) Sir, Your leader, 'Breaking the power duopoly', discussed a number of options but it appeared to favour referring National Power and PowerGen to the Monopolies Commission. The justification was based on the popular assumption that prices in the electricity pool are too high. Pool prices are not high. In 1990, at less than 2p per unit, they were absurdly low and my association told your newspaper that unrealistic prices would damage the emergence of competition. Today, still far below 3p, they are at best barely adequate. The pool price may not be a perfect market price but it is vitally important for every company that makes and sells electricity. Producers must have a reasonable rate of return to stay in business. As for the concern that there may be too much generating capacity, for consumers that is not a problem, but a comfort. There can be little doubt they like electricity to be plentiful, reliable and reasonably priced. Most have fared well since privatisation, as the regulator, Professor Littlechild, stated in his annual report in May. Britain has a generating industry which in many respects is leading the world. Producers large and small are investing increasingly in clean and efficient electricity production. I doubt whether many of them would regard an MMC referral as helpful to themselves or to the industry's millions of customers.

			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / Taiwan bankcurbs loans to China The Bank of Taiwan, Taiwan's largest state-run commercial bank and issuer of the republic's currency, yesterday announced that it was freezing all its loans involved with investment in mainland China, AP-DJ reports from Taipei. The bank announced its decision after its board directors' meeting, saying that any loans with links to mainland investment - especially those for public construction projects in mainland China - would be carefully reviewed. Mr David Yu, research manager at Wardley James Capel Taiwan, said the decision was believed to have been authorised by the government to cool off the mainland investment heat. The manager stressed that such decision contradicts the Taiwanese government's internationalisation principle, 'but maybe it can keep the capital flowing out, a decision not bad for the stagnant local stock market'.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Banja Luka, 6 Mar (TANJUG) -- Maglaj has not  been bombed and the so-called army of Bosnia-Herzegovina, in  line with its common practice, has been setting old tires ablaze  to create an impression that the town was bombed, the  information service of the First Krajina Corps of the Serb  Republic Army said in today's statement in Banja Luka.    It is a question of the offensive which the so-called  Bosnia-Herzegovina Army began after the Croat-Muslim agreement  was signed in Washington. The offensive had also been announced  on several occasions in the media by the chief of their General  Staff, Army General Rasim Delic, and the chief of the Supreme  Command, General Sefer Halilovic.    The Serb army statement adds that in the past few days the  Muslim army stepped up the concentration of its forces from the  117th Muslim brigade, 208th shock Muslim brigade, and of new  units brought in from Kakanj to the areas of Gracanica and  Lukavac. Offensive actions have already started against Ozren,  Trebava, and Doboj. [passage omitted]    The statement also warns of a link between the commands of  the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army, UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces],  and also representatives of the EU observer mission staying at  the Internacional Hotel in Zenica.</p>

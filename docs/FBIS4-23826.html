			<p>BFN     [Text] The Portuguese News Agency, LUSA, quotes studies  published in the latest monthly information bulletin of France's  Medicins Sans Frontieres organization that more than 10,000  people have been victims of explosive devices in Mozambique  since the General Peace Accord was signed.    The source reports that studies carried out by the British  humanitarian organization [name indistinct] concluded that the  number of mines in Mozambique is significantly less than the 2  million previously estimated. In its report, the organization  expresses concern over mines in rural areas and added that with  the return of refugees many land mines are being discovered as  the land is being burned and cultivated. The Manhica, Moamba,  and Boane Districts in Maputo Province, and Caia and Nhamatanda  Districts in Sofala Province, have recorded the highest number  of victims following mine explosions.</p>

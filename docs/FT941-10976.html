			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / Privatisation dream turns into nightmare: A Polish bank sale has exposed a stock market weakness The queues twirl and intertwine around the room as people stand waiting to see a stockbroker in the crowded modern Warsaw office. More people stand in line in the street outside. It is a scene reminiscent of Poland's communist past. Yet its cause is the attempt to create a broadly-based share owning democracy in a newly capitalist economy. Similar scenes are repeated every day at most of the 400 or so stockbrokers' offices throughout Poland in the aftermath of the privatisation of Bank Slaski, one of Poland's top five banks. The flagship of the Polish privatisation programme is rapidly turning into a nightmare. About 800,000 people bought shares in the offer which is threatening to overwhelm Poland's young stock market established in 1991 with only 30 stockbrokers and a fledgling computer-based trading system. The consequences of the sale go far beyond the stock market. The Bank Slaski sale is proving extremely politically controversial. Mr Stefan Kawalec, a deputy finance minister who sold 25.9 per cent of the equity at the public offer price of 500,000 zlotys per share to the Dutch ING Bank, has already been dismissed after protests from the Peasant Party (PSL), part of the government coalition, that the bank had been undervalued. The protests have been fuelled by the volatile shifts in the bank's share price, which rose to 6.7m zlotys per share when first quoted on the Warsaw Stock Exchange (WSE) on January 25. Mr Marek Borowski, the finance minister who backed Kawalec on the issue, has since himself resigned leading to a crisis inside the governing coalition between his Social Democratic (SLD) party and the PSL led by Mr Waldemar Pawlak, the prime minister. But the situation is creating a different kind of tension in the queues at the stockbrokers. Many Poles have had their imaginations fired by a WSE index which has risen 14-fold over the past year. Having taken to investing like ducks to water they are finding that the pond has suddenly frozen over. Most of the people in the queues are there to open accounts with the stockbrokers to register their shares. Only once they are registered will they be able to sell them. The delays in registering shares has left investors frustrated as well as having a huge impact on the share price. Indeed the most probable reason for the 13.5 times increase in the bank's stock price when it was first quoted is that so few people were actually in a position to sell their shares because of delays in registration. Only 0.35 per cent of the issue was traded on the opening day. Since then a mere 3 per cent of the 3.7m shares sold in the public offer have changed hands. The finance ministry has demanded that the Bank Slaski explain the delays in issuing the shares and why it decided to ask the stock exchange to quote the stock when relatively few investors were actually in possession of their shares. The Securities Commission is conducting its own investigation into the case which may focus on the stock exchange's failure to postpone trading in the shares. The queues meanwhile are getting increasingly impatient. The share price has slipped by almost 30 per cent since January 25. But the great mass of investors, who were allocated three shares each in the oversubscribed offer, have been unable to sell their stakes. In Gdansk for example the Bank Gdanski, which has a broking operation, estimates that 50,000 people in the area have Bank Slaski shares. But the office, the only broker in the city which is still opening accounts, is processing only 500 a day. The offer has exposed the weakness of the stock market infrastructure. Last autumn, before the offer came to the market, there were about 150,000 investment accounts in the country. Analysts estimate that the Bank Slaski offer will add another 300,000 investors. The offer's oversubscription suggests the demand is even higher. That suggests the Polish privatisation process could be caught in a vice. On the one hand the government and investors are keen to see it go further. The programme includes the imminent sale of the Krakow based Bank Przemyslowo Handlowy and a number of other companies. Workers in companies to be privatised who will receive up to 10 per cent of the equity free are beginning to become keen on sales. Yet the danger is that just as privatisation is starting to attract investors to water, so the limits of the infrastructure will prevent most from drinking as quickly as they would like.</p>

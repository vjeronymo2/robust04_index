			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / Equity Markets: Other markets - Hong Kong Property company shares are likely to remain a key feature of trading in the colony this week as the sector rounds off its reporting season with the announcement of full-year figures by Sun Hung Kai Properties on Friday, writes Louise Lucas. The sector took a tumble at the end of last week after Cheung Kong, the property development company controlled by Mr Li Ka-shing, announced pre-sale prices for apartments in a New Territories development. These proved sharply below market expectations and those of recent pricings of similar developments. In response, the Hang Seng index fell 1.9 per cent on Friday, wiping out the benefit of cumulative rises seen during the four previous sessions and leaving the market 1.2 per cent lower on the week. This month's land auction is also expected to generate little excitement. Share prices could continue to trend lower on concerns about the over-heating economy in China and the poor state of Sino-British relations. Investors will also be looking to governor Chris Patten's policy speech on Wednesday for any signals of plans to improve co-operation between the two governments. Compiled by Michael Morgan</p>

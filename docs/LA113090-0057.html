			<p><P> November 30, 1990, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Bush Signs Tuna Labeling Law: Both tuna industry leaders and such one-time  antagonists as the Dolphin Coalition, a Washington-based umbrella group of 37  conservation organizations, applauded the signing by President Bush of laws  setting standards for "dolphin-safe" tuna. Packaged as amendments to the  Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976, the new statutes  define what canners must do before labeling their product as dolphin safe. Many  in the canning industry favored the bill because it provides a uniform  standard.  </P></p>

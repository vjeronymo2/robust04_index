			<p>BFN     [Text] The U.S. Government ratified its immigration policy  on Cubans who try to enter that nation through third countries.  Mike McCurry, spokesman for the U.S. State Department, said that  the U.S. Government will continue denying U.S. entry to those  Cubans who use third countries to achieve that purpose. McCurry  pointed out that U.S. immigration policy will remain unchanged,  while defending the decision of the U.S. Coast Guard to return  to the Bahamas 19 Cubans who on 12 April tried to enter U.S.  territory from those Caribbean islands.    The U.S State Department spokesman admitted that crossing  the  sea by Cubans who abandon the island in boats or fragile vessels  is not safe, but is a threat to their lives. Cuban authorities,  on the other hand, believe that Washington encourages the  illegal departure of Cubans by breaking the migration agreements  that establish a concession of up to 20,000 visas per year.    Wayne Smith, former head of the U.S. Interests Section in  Havana and an expert on Cuban issues, from the International  Center for International Policies, stated that the U.S.  Government has even systematically denied visas to people who  have traveled to the United States in the past.</p>

In a message to the defense minister,  President Salih ordered his defense minister to ban armed  flights without a prior agreement with the chief of staff and  the higher commander of the Yemeni Armed Forces.    In his message, the Yemeni president stressed that moving a  military unit from one place to another without a regular  approval by the higher commander of the Armed Forces constitutes  a violation of the Constitution and the document of accord,  which was signed in Amman last Sunday to end the political  crisis in the country.</p>

			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Bayer Bayer has yet again proved itself a class act. Its 60 per cent rise in year on year pre-tax profits during the third quarter was thanks to hard work as well as recovery. The cost-cutting has been impressive. During the last four years staff numbers have been cut 12 per cent, while salaries have been kept under control. Turnover has been almost static, yet sales per employee improved 11 per cent. Nor did Bayer stint on capital expenditure during the recession: the group will have invested more than DM15bn (Pounds 6.1bn) between 1990 and the end of this year. Such careful husbandry during the downturn is now being rewarded. Sales in all divisions have started to rise, driven by earlier strategic expansion into Asia, Latin America and the US. More is yet to come. The group is still to benefit fully from recovery in Europe, where more than half its turnover is generated. Year on year, prices were actually down 1 percentage point, but the group expects to push through increases. Weaknesses remain. The pharmaceuticals division has not performed well. However, management has high hopes for the new product portfolio and is following the example of other groups by reorganising research and development to raise productivity. Bayer has also addressed the dyestuffs operations' difficulties, placing them in a joint venture with Hoechst. The only problem is Agfa, its photographic business, which sits oddly within the group. Bayer should find some way of disposing of it. The shares, which have underperformed more cyclical stocks such as Hoechst and BASF, deserve a rerating.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Norman Patterton] </F>   [Text] Pretoria March 13 SAPA -- The right-wing Pretoria  Boerekommando is uncowed by the public execution of Afrikaner  Weerstandsbeweging [Afrikaner Resistance Movement--AWB] members  in Mmabatho, saying they would not follow Freedom Front leader  Gen Constand Viljoen into an election. Speaking at the  Wonderboom Fort they occupied in Pretoria on Sunday [13 March],  Commandant Willem Ratte, a former 32 Battalion Commander, said:  "We can't agree with what Gen Viljoen says. We can't take part  in our own funeral by taking part in the Azanian election."    Cmdt Ratte and a group of Boerecommando members in army  browns occupied the fort while a small but steady stream of  right-wing supporters trundled up the hill to express their  moral support. The group was armed, and had barricaded the  historic fort with razor wire and sandbags. The vierkleur  [four-color; flag of the former Transvaal Republic] and South  African flags were hoisted on the corners of the half-moon  shaped fort, similar in design to the Schanskop Fort they  previously occupied.    The security forces seemed to take no interest in the  occupation this time, after over-reacting at Schanskop. Traffic  police were on hand to regulate the traffic of curious arriving  visitors.    Cmdt Ratte said he expected the city council, which owns the  fort, to meet on Monday and to request the police to remove them  by force. "The situation may become a little bit serious.  We'll see what happens," he said, in an interview at the fort.  He said Gen Viljoen intervened last time, ending the Schanskop  siege, even though this was against the occupants' wishes.    Asked whether the rightwing may avenge the execution of the  AWB men in central Mmabatho, Cmdt Ratte said this would be  difficult because it would be difficult to identify the guilty  party. "The real guilt lies with the South African Government.  They created the conditions for that type of situation."    Cmdt Ratte objected to being labelled militant, saying  Afrikaners were a small group threatened by a mass of Azanians.  Afriakners had to choose between slavery under African National  Congress [ANC] President Nelson Mandela and South African  Communist Party Chairman Joe Slovo, or to making a stand. "It  is a question of self-preservation. We will be swamped if we  don't make a stand," he said.    Asked about the dented image of the rightwing after the  Mmabatho fiasco, Cmdt Ratte said the rightwingers had been  caught unawares by the Bophuthatswana Security Forces suddenly  switching their allegiance to the ANC after they had been  promised job security under an ANC government.    The ANC and the South African Government, after staging a  coup in Bophuthatswana, would now bring similar pressures to  bear on kwaZulu, he added.</p>

U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher announced that 73  million dollars of fresh U.S. assistance will be provided to  Cambodia over the next two years, while Japan was expected to  offer 9 billion yen in new grant aid over a year.    Pledges made at the two-day meeting of the International  Committee on the Reconstruction of Cambodia (ICORC),  participated in by 32 countries, the European Union, and 12  international bodies, are scheduled to be tallied up for  announcement on Friday.    At the outset of the meeting, Cambodian First Prime Minister  Norodom Ranariddh conveyed an appeal from King Norodom Sihanouk  for a modern-day "Marshall Plan" to help put the war-ravaged  country back on its feet.    In a message sent from Beijing, where he has been undergoing  medical treatment, Sihanouk said, "the gift of which my country  has the greatest need, having suffered from so many years of  turpitude and devastation, is none other than a new  unconditional Marshall Plan gauged to specific needs."    Sihanouk's reference was to a multibillion-dollar plan drawn  up by U.S. Secretary of State George Marshall in the late 1940s  to rehabilitate the shattered economies of post-World War II  European nations.    Christopher, meanwhile, urged continued global attention to  the problems faced by Cambodia and called for sustained  assistance to help it recover from the disasters of its past, as  well as "to help Cambodians take charge of their future."    "Events in Cambodia no longer make front page news around  the  world," he said. "That is in many ways a happy sign, but it is  not a reason to shift our attention. As Cambodia moves from  crisis to normality it is vital that we stay engaged."    Ranariddh, who was accompanied by Second Prime Minister Hun  Sen, told the delegates, "Cambodia deserves your help because it  helps itself." He said that the government, in the five months  since its formation in the wake of last May's U.N.-supervised  general election, has accomplished a great deal in spite of the  meager resources at its disposal.    Heeding international recommendations, Ranariddh said  Cambodia has implemented administrative reforms, put its  finances in order, stabilized the local currency and worked out  a satisfactory budget.    Sihanouk's message enumerated six priority areas for  external  assistance -- basic human needs in terms of sufficient access by  the population to food and medical care, agricultural and rural  development, infrastructure repair, environmental protection,  education and technical training, and industrialization. He  placed the utmost importance on improving conditions in rural  communities, where over 80 percent of all Cambodians eke out a  living, most of them "lacking even a roof over their head,  sufficient resources, work or the prospect of finding any."    Gordon Bilney, Australian minister for development  cooperation, echoed that "while macroeconomic assistance to  restructure the economy remains a vital goal...specific action  to alleviate poverty...must remain a high priority."    The first ICORC meeting, held at a working-level in Paris  last September, saw 119 million dollars in fresh commitments  added to the 880 million dollars garnered at a previous  ministerial conference on Cambodia held in Tokyo in June 1992.  While most of those funds were for short-term financial  support, the present ICORC meeting is focused on Cambodia's mid-  to long-term aid requirements.    Economy and Finance Minister Sam Rangsi detailed those  requirements and expressed confidence that with the support of  the donor community his government "can extend the `East Asian  miracle to Cambodia'."    He took the occasion to unveil Cambodia's new liberalized  investment law, which he said will not discriminate between  Cambodian and foreign nationals, will guarantee remittance of  foreign currencies and will offer various clear incentives.    Delegates from the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank  (ADB) praised the Cambodian Government for policies that have  brought rapid economic growth, slashed inflation and turned  about the fiscal deficit. But they warned that the  macroeconomic situation remains fragile, with the country still  highly dependent on external financing and suffering from a  limited foreign exchange earning capacity.    The international financial organizations urged Cambodia to  provide a vision of where the economy is headed, continue moving  toward a market economy, strengthen the role of the private  sector, work on rectifying the fiscal deficit and develop the  skills of the country's work force.</p>

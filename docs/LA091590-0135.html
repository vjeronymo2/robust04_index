			<p><P> September 15, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TITANS FIGURE THEY HAVE A CHANCE TODAY  </P> <P> Another week, another Southeastern Conference voyage, another dollar for the  Cal State Fullerton football team, which plays today at Mississippi State.  </P> <P> Until last week, one might have figured this was just another lucrative loss  for CSUF (Cal State Under-Funded). The needy Titans will collect $150,000 to  play the Bulldogs.  </P> <P> But that was before Fullerton's strong second-half showing in a 38-17 loss to  Auburn last week, a performance that made the Titans believe they can come  here, take the money and win, not run.  </P> <P> "We're still definite underdogs," Fullerton Coach Gene Murphy said. "But if we  play like we did in the second half against Auburn, we're capable of staying in  the game. We could beat them, but it would take a great effort by us, and some  great things would have to go our way."  </P> <P> It's amazing what outscoring Auburn, 14-7, in the second half will do for your  outlook on life.  </P> <P> There was virtually no talk of defeating the third-ranked Tigers last week. The  Titans' objectives were to be as competitive as possible and not be embarrassed  on the scoreboard.  </P> <P> Mission partially accomplished. The Tigers blew the Titans away in a 31-3 first  half, but Fullerton held its own in the second for a more-than-respectable  final score.  </P> <P> Many would have considered Mississippi State to be another heavy favorite  today, but the Titans' play against Auburn has changed Fullerton's  expectations.  </P> <P> The Titans figure if they can stick with Auburn, the SEC favorite, for a half,  why shouldn't they stick for two halves with Mississippi State, a lower-echelon  SEC team that lost to Tennessee, 40-7, last Saturday?  </P> <P> "We have a different confidence level this week -- we feel we can win,"  Fullerton running back Reggie Yarbrough said. "They're coming off a big loss  and are probably feeling low. We're at the point where if we put things  together, we can beat a lot of teams."  </P> <P> Murphy said if last Saturday's second half was an indication of how hard the  Titans can play, they'll do fine today. Problem is, Murphy doesn't know how his  inexperienced team will respond.  </P> <P> The Titans struggled to beat Division II Sonoma State, 38-24, in the season  opener and actually looked better in the second half against Auburn than they  did the entire game against Sonoma.  </P> <P> "I don't know this football team at all," Murphy said. "We didn't play with a  lot of emotion against Sonoma State, but we did against Auburn. The toughest  thing to do is emotionally arouse your team to perform at its highest level of  ability every week. So anything that would happen today would not surprise me."  </P> <P> One thing working for the Titans is their offensive style, which is foreign to  most SEC teams.  </P> <P> SEC teams are used to power offenses -- most would rather line up and stuff the  ball down your throat than pass. Games are usually won in the trenches.  </P> <P> Compared to the SEC's "smash-mouth" style, Fullerton's offense wags its tongue  at defenses, pecking away with quick short-yardage passes and spreading the  field by sending out four or five receivers.  </P> <P> There are even times when Fullerton uses a no-back set -- disdainful to SEC  fans but often effective for the Titans. Some Auburn players admitted it was  difficult adjusting to Fullerton's offense, and Murphy hopes the Bulldogs have  similar problems today.  </P> <P> "You can't smash-mouth when your only running back is your quarterback," Murphy  said. "If you're not used to seeing a spread offense all over the field, you're  bound to make mistakes. It would be like us facing a wishbone team. It would  take longer for us to prepare, because we don't see that in our conference."  </P> <P> Fullerton also doesn't see the kinds of athletes SEC teams face on a weekly  basis. Mississippi State might not be the class of the SEC, but the Bulldogs  are in a class above the Titans when it comes to speed, size and strength.  </P> <P> "Sometimes (our finesse) negates a mismatch in athletic ability," Murphy said.  "But for the most part, speed kills and athletic ability catches up to you."  </P> <P> Titan Notes  </P> <P> A connecting flight that was supposed to have taken the Titans from Nashville  to Jackson, Miss., was diverted from Detroit to Grand Rapids, Mich., because of  thunderstorms Friday, and that left the Titans stranded in the Nashville  airport for about six hours. When the team finally boarded another plane,  departure was delayed for another half hour because of thunderstorms. The team  missed a scheduled practice Friday evening and didn't arrive at its Columbus,  Miss., hotel until 11:45 p.m. (CDT). . . . Freshman kickoff returner Dwayne  McAfee missed the bus from Fullerton to LAX Friday morning and did not make the  trip to Mississippi.  </P> <P> Mississippi State Coach Rockey Felker said any thoughts his players entertained  of this being an easy victory dissipated when they watched films of the  Auburn-Fullerton game. "It certainly made our players realize that Fullerton is  a good team, even though we don't know much about them," Felker said. "They  battled Auburn, played very aggressively, and they gave them problems  offensively and defensively. . . . Fullerton has its share of problems, too.  Considered one of its strengths in the preseason, the Titans' defensive  secondary is hurting. Free safety Terry Tramble, an All-Big West Conference  pick in 1989, is out for the season with a broken forearm and cornerback Nuygen  Pendleton has been slowed by a sprained ankle. Auburn took full advantage of  the soft spots, passing for 339 yards and four touchdowns last week. . . .  Offensive lineman John Cotti and Tim Drevno are also questionable for today's  game with injuries. . . . One of Mississippi State's best defensive players is  nose guard Demetrius Hill, a cousin of former Fullerton defensive lineman Jerry  Leggett, who was recently cut by the Los Angeles Rams. Leggett, a Titan in  1988, played three seasons at Mississippi State before transferring to  Fullerton. . . . The Bulldogs have a dangerous return man in Tony James, who  had 82 yards on two kickoff returns last week and a 71-yard punt return for a  touchdown.  </P></p>

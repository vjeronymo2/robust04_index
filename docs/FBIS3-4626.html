			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kuala Lumpur, Fri [25 February] -- Bilateral trade  between Malaysia and Britain has been on the uptrend since 1988  with the balance of trade in the latter's favour all the while.    In the first nine months of last year, two-way trade  amounted  to RM [Malaysian ringgit] 6.5 billion. Although statistics for  the whole of 1993 are still not available, last year's total  trade between the two nations may well surpass the previous  year's figures.    In 1992, Malaysia's imports from Britain totalled RM4.14  billion. Its exports were RM2.55 billion.    Malaysia buys electrical equipment, power generators and  heavy industrial machinery from Britain. Malaysia on the other  hand, sells primary commodities, machinery, telecommunication  equipment, garments and apparel, accessories and sawn timber to  Britain.    Statistics show that bilateral trade between Britain and  Malaysia has been particularly strong in the past four to five  years reaching its peak in 1991 with total trade surpassing  RM4.4 million.    During the same period, British investments in Malaysia have  also increased significantly to almost RM900 million in 1990  compared to RM750 million in 1989.    Following stiff competition from other foreign investors,  particularly Japanese, Taiwanese as well as American, British  investors have taken a back seat -- resulting in a downtrend in  investments since 1991.    British investments in Malaysia dropped to below RM300  million in 1992. Nevertheless, Britain remained the largest  European investor in Malaysia.    The current trade figures between the two countries are  indeed a far cry from the days when Malaysia launched the "Buy  British Last" policy in October 1981.    Although officials maintained that trade to and from Britain  was not really affected during the period, there was only  marginal increase in total trade.    For instance, bilateral trade was barely above RM2 billion  in  1981, 1982 and 1983.    This was because the private sector continued to purchase  British goods as they were priced competitively amidst the  depreciating pound sterling.    The "Buy British Last" policy was introduced following  accumulative "irritants" that the country faced in its relations  with Britain and British companies.    The breaking point was when the British Government announced  a substantial increase in student fees which severely affected  more than 15,000 Malaysian students in Britain.    Other factors which had triggered the policy included the  failure of British companies to comply with the requirement of  the National Economic Policy and the landing rights for Malaysia  Airlines (MAS).    The policy called for all British contracts to be vetted  thoroughly by the Prime Minister's Department together with the  second choice non-British bidder.    Realising that the policy had caused British companies  countless lucrative government contracts, the then British  premier Margaret Thatcher personally intervened to patch things  up.</p>

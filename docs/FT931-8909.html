			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / Opec cuts output in bid to shore up oil prices A CUT in crude oil production by almost 1m barrels a day in the second quarter of 1993 was agreed by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries last night in a determined attempt to bolster world oil prices. The cuts will be imposed in full by March 1. Opec ministers concluded almost four days of talks in Vienna by agreeing to make pro-rata cuts to a ceiling of 23.85m b/d - a figure which would take almost 1.5m b/d of oil off the market given that Opec has been producing well above its first-quarter ceiling. The organisation hopes the deal will at least support crude prices at present levels, which had hardened by more than Dollars 1.5 a barrel before the meeting on expectations of a deal to cut the second-quarter ceiling by 1m b/d. Markets reacted bearishly to the deal. In New York, US light crude futures ended 45 cents a barrel lower at Dollars 19.53 a barrel for March delivery. Industry analysts attending the meeting said that prices would only firm above present levels if Opec showed unusual discipline. Opec's president, Mr Alirio Parra of Venezuela, thought it less likely that members would fail to comply with quotas now, when prices are weak. 'Even allowing for leakage - and I think everyone believes compliance will be very important - you will still have a significant adjustment.' Saudi Arabia, Opec's biggest producer, has sought to convince the markets of Opec's seriousness by notifying its customers that it will be cutting production by 400,000 b/d to 8m b/d. Agreement on the final wording of the communique was delayed by strong disagreement between Kuwait and other member states about the Gulf state's desire for special mention. Kuwait agreed to cut production from its present claimed level of 1.98m b/d to 1.6m b/d, but argued fiercely that it should be given special treatment while recovering revenue lost during the Gulf war and while rebuilding its damaged oil industry. Kuwait wanted the final communique to acknowledge that its present production and capacity was temporary and did not reflect either its eventual output capacity or its historic market share within Opec. Kuwait had the capacity to pump up to 2.5m b/d before the Iraqi invasion. Iran and several other delegations opposed making special mention for Kuwait. Finally, the ministers agreed to include what one delegate called 'positions for the future'. In Kuwait's case, this appears to allow that the Gulf state will in the third quarter be allocated an output with parity to fellow members of equivalent capacity and historic market share. Iraq, which had its quota cut from 500,000 to 400,000 b/d but did not send its minister to the talks, rejected the deal as 'nonsense'.</p>

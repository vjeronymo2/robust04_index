			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 18 KYODO -- A group of more than 500  Japanese lawmakers urged the government of Prime Minister  Tsutomu Hata on Wednesday [18 May] to help protect the human  rights of people in Myanmar [Burma] and establish civilian rule  in the country.    House of Representatives member Shokei Arai told a news  conference he visited Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai at  the premier's official residence and handed him a copy of a  petition signed by 508 Japanese legislators.    The letter calls for the "immediate and unconditional  release" of Myanmar's opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi and all  political prisoners in Myanmar as well as a "swift and complete  implementation of a transition to civilian rule."    While noting that Tokyo has been demanding the release of  the  Nobel Peace prize laureate, Kumagai reportedly vowed greater  efforts to make Myanmar become a democratic nation.    Arai, a member of the new party Jiyuto (Liberals) headed by  Foreign Minister Koji Kaikzawa, said he and his associates plan  to send the petition to U.N. Secretary General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali, if possible by late July, when Suu Kyi was  originally expected to be released from house arrest.    It will be the second such letter by Japanese politicians to  the U.N. chief, following one by 374 Diet members sent to  Butrus-Ghali in March 1993.    Last April, 422 Diet members urged the government to put  pressure on Myanmar to release Suu Kyi.    A founder of the National League for Democracy (NLD) which  won the 1990 general election by a landslide, Suu Kyi has been  under house arrest since July 1989.    She was expected to be freed July 19 this year from her  five-year detention, the maximum period allowed under law.    But in February the ruling junta, which refused to hand over  power five years ago, said it regards the first year of her  detention as an "arrest period" and full detention was not  imposed until July 1990. She is now expected to be freed in  July 1995.</p>

			<p><P> August 8, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PILOT FLYING TOO SLOWLY, FRIEND SAYS;  </P> <P> FISH-SPOTTING PLANE APPEARED TO STALL, THEN PLUNGED IN SEA  </P> <P> The missing pilot of a light plane that crashed into the ocean off Dana Point  probably lost control of the craft when he spotted a swordfish and slowed to  track its movement for a fishing boat, a close friend said Monday.  </P> <P> Joseph A. Shirley had been flying for about an hour Sunday morning when his  single-engine plane appeared to stall in midair, then plunged several hundred  feet into the Pacific about 10 miles southwest of Dana Point, said Dick  McDowell, a longtime friend of the 42-year-old pilot and building contractor  from Del Mar.  </P> <P> Based on reports from eyewitnesses, McDowell speculated that Shirley was so  intent on keeping track of a fish he had located that he purposely slowed the  plane's engine to a near idle. But when the craft began to dive, Shirley was  unable to regain enough speed to avoid crashing at about 11:30 a.m.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Experienced Spotter'  </P> <P> "Joe is an experienced fish spotter, but it has been a slow summer," said  McDowell, owner of an aviation charter business at an El Cajon airport east of  San Diego where Shirley kept his plane. "My guess is, he got so excited about  finally spotting a swordfish, he did everything he could not to lose that  fish."  </P> <P> Added McDowell, who also spots fish for commercial boats: "Joe was a good, very  good pilot. This is sad."  </P> <P> Authorities called off the search for Shirley's Cessna 172 late Sunday because  rescuers found only minor debris from the plane's cabin -- paper cups, a can of  wax, a tennis shoe and an aerosol can.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Search Lasted 10 Hours  </P> <P> A pair of U.S. Coast Guard cutters as well as two U.S. Navy vessels spent  nearly 10 hours Sunday covering a 77-square-mile area in near-perfect weather,  Coast Guard Petty Officer Dennis Hall said. Visibility at the time of the crash  and most of Sunday afternoon was 15 to 20 miles with light winds and only  two-foot swells.  </P> <P> "Everything they found fit into one small box," Hall said. "The plane  apparently sank like a rock."  </P> <P> Ocean depths reach 2,400 feet near the crash site, making it extremely  difficult to retrieve the plane, Hall said.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, investigators with the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board  are looking into the incident. Because no engine nor other parts of the plane  were found, the agency's review will rely on eyewitness accounts of the crash,  as well as interviews with Shirley's family and friends and an examination of  the plane's maintenance records. Shirley's medical history will also be  explored to determine if he had heart disease or other ailments that may have  contributed to the crash.  </P> <P> "For all we know, he could have had a heart attack. We just don't know," said  Gary Mucho, the investigator in charge of the NTSB's Los Angeles office. "This  is a tough one because we have no wreckage to examine. We may never know what  happened."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Flying Too Low and Slow  </P> <P> The pilot's brother also speculated that Shirley may have been flying too low  and too slow, causing the engine to stall. When the plane hit the water, the  pilot may have been knocked unconscious, said John Shirley.  </P> <P> "He just was not as astute as he could have been," said John Shirley, who owns  a Del Mar hot-air balloon company. "Aviation is very unforgiving. It's not like  a walk in the park."  </P> <P> John Shirley does not believe that his brother's body will ever be recovered.  "I just wish he wasn't dead," he said. "It was too sudden, too permanent."  </P> <P> Shirley, a bachelor, was described by McDowell as an "experienced pilot" with  more than 2,000 flying hours. In the late 1970s, McDowell sold Shirley his  first plane. About three months ago, Shirley bought the Cessna he was flying  Sunday. It is not considered a high-performance plane and is capable of top  speeds of little more than 115 miles per hour. But the aircraft is well-suited  to the slow, often tedious flying required to spot swordfish for commercial  fishing boats. The swordfish like to sun themselves in the warmer waters near  the surface.  </P> <P> Though Shirley's new plane was built in 1967, McDowell said it was in  "excellent condition."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Enough Fuel for 4 Hours  </P> <P> A contractor specializing in custom homes, Shirley kept his plane at Gillespie  Field, a general aviation airport in El Cajon where more than 700 planes are  parked. McDowell said Shirley took off about 10:30 a.m. Sunday with enough fuel  to stay airborne nearly four hours.  </P> <P> As he did often in the past, Shirley agreed to spend several hours helping to  spot swordfish for a friend who skippers a commercial fishing boat out of San  Diego, McDowell said. The boat, the Horizon, was operating over the weekend  from Dana Point Harbor. McDowell said Shirley was not working for pay.  </P> <P> McDowell said: "He just loves to fly, and he liked to go up and spot fish  because of the challenge. He knew the risks, but he was an adventurer."  </P> <P> Joseph Shirley is survived by his brother, a sister and his mother, who lives  in Newport Beach.  </P> <P> Staff writer Anthony Millican in San Diego contributed to this report.  </P></p>

			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Banks win praise for flexibility THE CLEARING banks are not used to praise these days, but the west Midlands regional group of chambers of commerce said yesterday there is growing evidence of a more flexible approach to customers. The group, representing 13 chambers and more than 600 companies, said the clearers were looking more closely at balance sheet performance when arranging loans for finance expansion. The Bank of England has received complaints in recent months over clearing banks' lending policies, which have been criticised for linking risk on borrowing solely to fixed assets, rather than performance. This prompted the Bank to raise the concerns of employers with the clearers last month. 'Banks are now being more innovative in their attempts to assist companies,' according to the latest quarterly economic survey collated from chambers of commerce in the west Midlands. These innovations include banks restructuring loans, converting overdrafts into term-borrowing and considering taking deferred equity as security. Mr Roger Dickens, deputy chairman of the regional chambers, said the change in tactics reflected determination by banks to reduce receiverships and associated losses on loans. The main innovators had been Midland and Lloyds, he added. Midland Bank said yesterday it was planning to launch a regional enterprise fund to raise venture capital of between Pounds 75,000 and Pounds 150,000. Lloyds claimed it had reduced reliance on short-term finance and had set up 'business customer panels' to deal with complaints. The increased signs of flexibility have been welcomed in the region. Linread, fasteners manufacturer, said its lenders had put together packages to help it expand and restructure debt cover. Burra Burra, the Birmingham-based computer company, said its expansion had been made possible by its bankers drawing up new loans. The chambers said expansion in the region had been undermined by a decline in export orders. According to its quarterly economic survey, orders in the past three months were flat or falling for most companies. Companies reporting growing overseas sales fell back from 32 per cent in the second quarter to 30 per cent. The downturn was partly offset by an increase in domestic orders, up from 34 per cent to 40 per cent.</p>

			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / International Company News: Portuguese bank posts 16% rise Banco Portugues do Atlantico (BPA), Portugal's biggest retail banking group, yesterday reported a 16.3 per cent increase in consolidated net profits in 1993 to Es23.5bn (Dollars 134m). Net assets for the group rose 52.4 per cent to Es3,426bn. BPA plans to seek shareholder approval in March for a rights issue that would increase share capital from Es100bn to Es110bn. A dividend of Es132 per share, 10 per cent higher than in 1992, was announced. The group also plans capital increases for Uniao de Bancos Portugueses, a retail bank in which BPA bought a controlling stake in 1993, and for Banco Comercial de Macau, the third bank in the group. Despite recession last year, the amount of credit extended by BPA increased 51.7 per cent to Es1,452bn and deposits grew 61.1 per cent to Es2,056bn. Trading in government debt securities earned the group Es961bn, up 51.3 per cent. The third stage of the privatisation of BPA later this year will reduce the state holding to about 25 per cent. This stake will be further diluted by the planned capital increase, in which the state is not expected to participate. Celulose do Caima, one of Portugal's four big paper pulp producers, yesterday announced a loss of Es5.5bn for 1993, which it described as one of the worst years ever for the industry worldwide. The loss, which compares with a loss of Es1bn in 1992, included an extraordinary cost of Es4.3bn for the closure of one of the company's two main production centres because of excess capacity in a depressed market.</p>

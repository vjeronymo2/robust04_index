			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] The Japan Information Center for Science and  Technology (JICST), which is the part of the Science and  Technology Agency, and the Science and Information Center  (NACSIS), a part of the Ministry of Education, will start to  interconnect each of their own online networks in the beginning  of November. JICST has 11,000 users (number of passwords issued)  and NACSIS has 5,600 users (number of passwords issued). As a  result of interconnecting the two networks, a giant science and  technology information network will be realized. Although there  are small problems of system design and user fees at present,  the two centers have ``almost worked out the technical problems  such as use of gateways (connectivity).''    JICST is providing online information services to the  private sector and universities with 22 of their own databases  including a ``Science and Technology Reference File'' and a  ``Science and Technology Research Information File'' as well as  files formed by external organizations, in which 27 million  items of data have been collected. This will be the largest  commercial science and technology database in Japan.    On the other hand, ``NACSIS - IR (Information Retrieval)''  provides data with 36 million items to universities, national  joint organizations, and specialized schools with 35 kinds of  database ranging from the natural sciences to the humanities and  sociology, including several types of databases such as  ``Overview of Science Research Results By Supplementary Fund,''  ``Academic Thesis and Dissertation Retrieval,'' and ``Academic  Papers Presented.'' It is a closed circuit system in which use  is limited to the academic institutions permitted by the  Ministry of Education.    JOIS was established to meet the need for making joint  university and national level research available to the private  sector. From now on, the range of databases that both  organizations will provide will be discussed, but by  establishing a one year trial period, any problems that might  occur can be studied.    Also since NACSIS is collecting fees from researchers at  universities, the costs will decline. The approval of an  academic discount for users of NACSIS-IR will be discussed with  JICST.    Although a new password is needed if a user wants to access  both systems, both organizations will take applications enabling  users to access both by issuing all passwords at one time.</p>

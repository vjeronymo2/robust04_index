			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Nuclear power row renewed The future of Germany's most modern, and hitherto most useless, nuclear power plant is back in the firing line, in a new confrontation over nuclear energy. The power station at Mulheim-Karlich, owned by RWE, Germany's largest electricity utility, has stood idle since it was virtually completed in 1988, because of a refusal by the local authorities to grant the necessary operating licences. RWE is threatening to sue the state government of the Rhineland-Palatinate - headed by Mr Rudolf Scharping, leader of the opposition Social Democratic party in Bonn - for some DM500m (Pounds 198m) in lost revenues and accumulated financing costs for the plant. It was ready to come on stream a year after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, which saw a complete standstill on all new nuclear projects in Germany. Now Mr Klaus Topfer, federal environment minister in Bonn, is threatening to take the Rhineland-Palatinate government to the constitutional court. He has ordered Ms Claudia Martini, his counterpart in Mainz, the state capital, to rescind her decision refusing to give a long-term operating licence to the plant, on the grounds that she is exceeding her statutory authority. Ms Martini is refusing to back down, insisting that it is the federal government, not the state, which is at fault. The new grounds for her refusal to license the power station concern the failure of RWE, and the federal government, to ensure a clear means of disposing of the nuclear waste which will be generated by its operation. At present, nuclear waste in Germany is supposed to be reprocessed under contracts with France, and with Britain's BNFL, for eventual re-use in Germany as mixed-oxide (MOX) fuel elements. However, there remains no long-term solution for the disposal of the residual nuclear waste, and manufacture of the MOX elements has also been blocked by the SPD-Green government in neighbouring Hesse.</p>

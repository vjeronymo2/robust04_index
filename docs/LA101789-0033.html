			<p><P> October 17, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEWS;  </P> <P> 'FROG GIRL' STANDS HER GROUND IN 'SCHOOLBREAK SPECIAL'  </P> <P> In 1987, Jenifer Graham, a 10th grader at Victor Valley High in Victorville,  had her biology grade changed from an A to a C for refusing, on moral grounds,  to dissect a frog.  </P> <P> Backed by the Humane Society, she took the issue to court. Although her C grade  still stands, her suit helped bring about California's Students' Rights Bill,  allowing students to make a choice about dissection without fear of penalty.  </P> <P> CBS tells her story in "The Frog Girl," today's "Schoolbreak Special" at 3 p.m.  on Channels 2 and 8.  </P> <P> It's a straightforward telling: Jenifer's request that she be excused from the  dissection because, as a vegetarian and animal lover, she found it ethically  wrong; the escalation of administration objection to her bucking of the system,  and her distress at being the target of contempt from other students and on  view in the media.  </P> <P> Intercut throughout the film are snippets of re-enacted testimony before a  California legislative subcommittee considering the students' rights measure.  (Lesley-Anne Down makes the briefest of cameos here.)  </P> <P> Directed by Harry Longstreet -- he and Renee Longstreet wrote the script -- the  show itself is a trial at times.  </P> <P> Ellen Dunning, as Jenifer, is not particularly appealing, too often seeming  whiny and holier-than-thou. As her mom, Kerrie Keane appears to blossom during  all the media attention, like an overeager stage mother.  </P> <P> Still, the film succeeds in showing Graham's story as a fascinating progression  of events.  </P> <P> While the issue may seem frivolous at first, the point is made that using a  disposable supply of small lives deserves serious thought.

			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / International Company News: Mexico sells stake in Banoro THE MEXICAN government has sold just over 66 per cent of Banoro for Dollars 366m. This is equivalent to 3.95 times the bank's book value and a little more than eight times last year's earnings. Banoro is the 15th bank to be privatised in Mexico. The three remaining government-owned banks that have to be sold by the middle of this year are Banco Internacional, Banco del Centro and Banco del Norte. The bank was bought by a syndicate of about 600 investors headed by Mr Rodolfo Esquer, Mr Fernando Obregon and Mr Juan Antonio Beltran. The group comprises the main stockholders and clients of Estrategia Bursatil, one of Mexico's oldest brokerage firms. According to the finance ministry, the winning group intends to form an integrated financial group based in north-western Mexico, an area where Banoro has traditionally operated. Only two groups bid for Banoro, both of them led by well-known regional businessmen. The winning group offered almost 20 per cent more that its rival. The group paid 3,096.08 pesos per share (about Dollars 1). However, this compared with the losing group's offer of 2,587 pesos per share.</p>

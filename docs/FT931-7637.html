			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Clinton's tax plan will sap energy of aluminium sector PRESIDENT CLINTON'S proposed energy tax is bound to hit US aluminium producers, but the effect will be gradual and not severe enough to shut down capacity analysts say. Mr Clinton's proposal for a broad-based energy tax immediately drew attention to the aluminium industry, which is North America's largest industrial user of electricity. A Prudential Securities analysis puts energy at 28 per cent of the average US aluminium production cost. However, North America's aluminium producers are diversified both geographically and in terms of their energy sources, so the impact of the energy tax will vary from company to company. The president has proposed to tax energy on the basis of heat content, measured in British Thermal Units. The tax would be phased in gradually over three years. Coal, the most widely used fuel in US aluminium smelters, would face the same levy as natural gas, at 25.7 cents per million BTUs, and crude oil would be taxed at a rate of 59.9 cents per million BTUs. Hydroelectric power, the energy source of choice in most western US smelters, would not be subject to the new tax. The structure of the tax has left securities analysts puzzling over the proposal's effect on metals companies' earnings. Reynolds metals, for example, operates its smelters mainly on hydro power. Alcoa, the largest US aluminium producer, smelted 600,000 tonnes of last year's 1.3m tonne US production using coal. However, that coal was taken from Alcoa's own mines and used in its own power generators, an arrangement that is likely to avoid the tax. The balance of Alcoa's production was fired by hydropower. Amax, another large US producer, has a less diversified energy mix, and is expected to be hit harder. Mr Vahid Fathi, metals analyst with Kemper Securities, said that while the energy tax on average could raise aluminium production costs by 2 per cent by 1996, US-produced aluminium would still be cheaper than its European counterparts. 'The spread will still be in favour of North America. Even with the energy tax, European costs are significantly higher,' Mr Fathi said. Canada and South America would continue to be the world's lowest-cost aluminium producers and the present state of global aluminium overcapacity would make it difficult for US producers to pass on the new energy costs. While Mr Clinton's energy tax is included in a wide-ranging plan to cut the US deficit and stimulate economic growth, it is not certain that a rise in the US growth rate would boost aluminium demand. Aluminium prices are set internationally and world demand for the metal grew by less than 2 per cent last year. Recessions in Japan and in parts of Europe are expected to limit demand growth this year. Mr J. Clarence Morrison, metals analyst at Prudential Securities, says the global supply-demand situation for aluminium is so dismal that the energy tax will have little or no impact on the worldwide industry, and only selective impact on individual aluminium producers.</p>

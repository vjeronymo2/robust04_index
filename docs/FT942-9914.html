			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / Insurers warned of takeover threat Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, has urged insurance companies to do more to protect themselves against the threat of hostile takeovers. Merger and acquisition activity was likely to increase again as Europe came out of the recession, Mr Heseltine told a dinner of the Association of British Insurers.

He said insurers faced new challenges, and moves were needed 'that will enable you to stand against that cold wind which is blowing across the globalised market'. Mr Heseltine's remarks follow a recent 'Swot' (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats) analysis of the industry by the Department of Trade and Industry. Although the UK insurers had strong products and systems, and a well regarded system of regulation, the quality of some of their underwriting had been poor. Also, Mr Heseltine said insurers' costs were still too high in some areas. In addition, concerns about 'mis-selling' in life insurance and in some other areas had created an 'image problem'. Threats facing the industry included the trend towards self-insurance by many buyers, technological and judicial inflation and the adequacy of reinsurance. In the life sector, insurers faced competition from unit trusts and deposit-based products. Mr Heseltine called for a dialogue with the industry but warned that the department was not about to become 'a soft touch'.

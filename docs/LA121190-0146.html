			<p><P> December 11, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> KEEPING FIT: A PORTABLE BREATH OF LIFE;  </P> <P> NEW TECHNOLOGY IN OXYGEN TANKS GIVES ADDED MOBILITY TO PEOPLE WITH BREATHING  PROBLEMS  </P> <P> Two years ago, Robert Beals of San Clemente realized that it was time to get  serious about his health. Since then, he has quit smoking, developed a regular  exercise habit and started using supplemental oxygen. "They gave me a choice,"  he says. "I could extend and improve the quality of my life, or I could just  keep going the way I was.  </P> <P> "So it really wasn't hard to choose."  </P> <P> Beals, 74, has had lung problems since he was a child. "I had double pneumonia  on two occasions, and I've been a little bit short of breath ever since," he  says. From the time he was a teen-ager, he compounded the problem by smoking.  </P> <P> Emphysema, a chronic lung disease most often brought on by smoking, began to  slow him down about 10 years ago. He tired more easily, became short of breath  more often. But he kept going, traveling frequently to the Far East on  business. It was on one of those trips that he finally became so ill he needed  oxygen on the flight home.  </P> <P> "I'd had a flu bug before I left, but on the trip it just kept getting worse.  When I got back, I had lost a lot of weight and I had pneumonia. After that, my  doctors suggested I go on oxygen full time," Beals says.  </P> <P> Now Beals feels better than he has in years.  </P> <P> Although he prefers not to schedule his workouts, he makes sure he gets in  exercise sessions about three times a week. Some days, he walks along the shore  near Dana Point Harbor. Other times, particularly when the air is smoggy, he  moves indoors to walk at the Mission Viejo or Laguna Hills malls. Or he stays  home and rides his exercise bike.  </P> <P> And if he happens to be in Singapore or Thailand or Taiwan or any of the other  places he visits frequently as a manufacturer's representative, he does his  walking there, carrying a small portable oxygen tank in an over-the-shoulder  carrying case.  </P> <P> When Beals first began using oxygen, he wasn't quite so mobile. Although he  soon felt well enough to exercise, he was encumbered by a tank so big and heavy  he had to pull it along on a cart. It was a nuisance, especially for activities  such as going to the beach -- the cart didn't move so well in the sand.  </P> <P> And people stared. Beals says he still gets odd looks now and then from  strangers who notice the nasal cannula that connects him to the portable tank,  "But when that happens, I just smile, and they usually smile back."  </P> <P> Although supplemental oxygen has proven its worth in numerous studies over the  past decade or so, many of those who could benefit from it are reluctant to use  it.  </P> <P> Dr. Paul Selecky, a pulmonary specialist at Hoag Hospital in Newport Beach and  president of the American Lung Assn.'s Orange County chapter, understands those  apprehensions.  </P> <P> "It's a visible change," he says. "People see them with the oxygen cannula in  their nose, and suddenly their personal life has become public."  </P> <P> Although going on oxygen may feel like taking a step down in terms of health,  it's more likely to be a step up, Selecky says. "This has set many patients  free, and allowed them to do things they wouldn't have been able to do before.  They can travel, they can get involved in exercise programs. And new  technologies have allowed this to be done more and more efficiently."  </P> <P> Selecky recalls one patient, formerly an avid skier, whose illness kept him  from hitting the slopes. "The combination of exertion and the higher altitude  made it impossible for him. But with the use of a small oxygen tank he was able  to carry in a little backpack, he started skiing again," Selecky says.  </P> <P> Over the past several years, oxygen tanks have become smaller and lighter,  Selecky says. And with battery-powered electronic delivery devices that only  release the gas when the user is inhaling, the supply also lasts longer.  </P> <P> Beals uses a system called Vagabond, made by Anaheim-based XEBEK International.  XEBEK President John Dooley says he got the idea to make smaller, lighter  oxygen tanks several years ago when his 80-year-old mother-in-law began using  oxygen because of heart and respiratory problems.  </P> <P> "The cylinder she had to use was so big you'd need to be 6-foot-4 and weigh 220  pounds to carry it. And she weighs about 85 pounds soaking wet. When I saw  that, I said, 'Wait a minute -- there's got to be an easier way to do this.' "  </P> <P> So using fiberglass composite materials that were originally developed for NASA  rocket motor casings, XEBEK developed a smaller, lighter cylinder. "Our system  weighs less than 5 pounds, and lasts an average of about 12 hours."  </P> <P> XEBEK has also developed an even smaller system for children.  </P> <P> Older patients suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD)  such as emphysema and chronic bronchitis are the ones most likely to need extra  oxygen, Selecky says, although not all such patients do. The deciding factor is  an analysis of arterial blood gases. If the level of oxygen is below a certain  level, then the patient may need to be breathing in more oxygen than is  available in the atmosphere, about 21%.  </P> <P> Some patients may need oxygen full time, while others don't. "There are  patients with significant lung disease or heart disease who may have adequate  levels (of oxygen) at rest. But their lungs can't keep up when they get  physically active. Similarly, there are patients whose oxygen only drops below  that critical level during sleep."  </P> <P> Other COPD patients may not need help except at higher altitudes, or in  airplanes, where the pressurized air is roughly equivalent to that on an  8,000-foot mountain peak.  </P> <P> "Every airline has a different policy about oxygen," Selecky says. "Some don't  provide it at all, and others will if you order it ahead of time. But they're  not required to provide it."  </P> <P> Beals, who spends a lot of time on airplanes, hasn't had trouble getting the  airlines he deals with to provide oxygen. But he'd rather just take along his  own tank. "They won't let me do that," he says. "I can take it in my checked  baggage, but only if it's empty. So when I get there, I have to go to a  hospital or someplace and get it filled."  </P> <P> Oxygen isn't an explosive gas, but it does support combustion and should not be  used around open flames. Still, airlines and some cruise ship lines are wary  about letting their passengers bring it on board.  </P> <P> "We've been working with the airlines to get them to use our system," Dooley  says. It's absolutely safe to use and transport. Obviously you don't want to be  throwing it around like a basketball, but if somebody bumps it, there's no  problem."  </P></p>

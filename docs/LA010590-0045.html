			<p><P> January 5, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOOK REVIEW;  </P> <P> SUMMER TALE OF GHOSTBUSTING, PARAPSYCHOLOGY  </P> <P> Julian's House by Judith Hawkes (Ticknor &amp; Fields: $18.95; 345 pp.)  </P> <P> Ghostbusters for grown-ups, "Julian's House" is crammed with information about  parapsychology. The agreeable young couple who rent the haunted Gilfoy house in  the pleasant Massachusetts town of Skipton both have advanced degrees in the  field, and plan to write a definitive paper on their summer adventures.  </P> <P> Though the Gilfoy house is fully furnished with a spirit presence that  manifests itself in multiple ways, the Curtisses must supply the modern  conveniences of their profession. All they get with the lease is a history of a  bobbing light, a freezing draft in the master bedroom, an assortment of knocks  and thumps, the howling of an invisible dog and an unconfirmed report of a  green face at an attic window. To capture these elusive phenomena in action,  they've borrowed the most advanced and sophisticated tools of their trade:  cameras triggered by disturbances in the air; buzzers activated by subtle  gradations in sound, light, heat and cold; tape recorders sensitive to noise  unheard by human ears, and capacitance meters, which measure changes in the  electromagnetic field. In addition to this carload full of state-of-the-art  paraphernalia, David and Sally Curtiss have also brought along some marital  problems, which they hope will be resolved by a summer of working together in  this idyllic setting.  </P> <P> They begin their research by sending out questionnaires to all previous tenants  of the house, and are gratified by prompt replies corroborating the  disturbances. The few refusals only convince them that things too terrible to  recall have indeed happened on the Gilfoy premises. Still, the first few weeks  of their own tenancy are remarkably and disappointingly tranquil. Except for  the faint scent of a non-existent wood fire, the house seems the ideal summer  rental. To jazz things up, the Curtisses invite a highly recommended medium  from Boston to visit, hoping that her presence will lure the spirit out of  hiding.  </P> <P> A charming and attractive black woman, a set designer by profession, Rosanna  manages to elicit some action from the hitherto reluctant ghost, as well as  rousing David's dormant sexuality. Unfortunately for the pace of the story,  Rosanna is recalled to Boston; the empty space filled by extraordinarily  detailed descriptions of the methodology of psychic research. The author has  obviously done her homework, and though she carefully avoids committing herself  to a belief in the supernatural, the reader is encouraged, if not urged, to  open his mind and let the occult in, as some extremely eminent people always  have.  </P> <P> Matters perk up somewhat when Sally meets the delightful town librarian and  amateur historian, Colin, an elderly gentleman who has lived in Skipton all his  life and can lead them to sources who might otherwise not volunteer to be  interviewed. Once Colin joins the team, the Curtisses start to make headway. He  finds old newspaper sources recording dark days in the Gilfoy manse; diaries  with cryptic references to the personality of the Rev. Joshua Gilfoy, and  gradually, a picture of an anguished 19th-Century family emerges; providing  enough tumult to permeate the material of the house and cause the ruckus  perceived by the tenants.  </P> <P> All you need do is persuade yourself that inanimate objects absorb the history  of their owners, which is one of the prime hypotheses of parapsychology.  Sensitive people (Hawkes is chary of the word medium) can pick up these, well,  "vibrations," when conditions are propitious. Sally Curtiss is just such a  sensitive person, though she's unwilling to accept either the label or its  implications. In fact, David was first attracted to her because she performed  so brilliantly on telepathic tests, but who wants to be loved for her Rhine  scores alone?  </P> <P> Towards the end of the book, when the experiment seems doomed by her reluctance  to participate actively, Sally reluctantly agrees to serve as medium, and  matters magically fall into place. To placate those who may have had trouble  suspending their disbelief, the author supplies a scientifically plausible  explanation for all events, but it's plain that her heart isn't in it.  </P> <P> Shifting between lyrical, didactic and conversational tones, the novel seems to  reflect the accepted definition of a medium as someone with unresolved multiple  personalities. Sally, David, and Colin try valiantly, but "Julian's House"  could use a character like the "Stay-Puff Marshmallow Man" to keep the story  buoyant.  </P></p>

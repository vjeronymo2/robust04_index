			<p>BFN     [Text] On election night Gyula Horn, chairman of the MSZP  [Hungarian Socialist Party], gave several interviews in which he  outlined the party's program. Now, however, he is speaking  about foreign policy questions:    [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] You said that  your first visit will take you to Bonn. Will the second one be  to Brussels? A year ago you were not the first to raise the  question of Hungary's NATO membership.    [Horn] Yes, but now, when referring to Brussels, I was  thinking not of NATO but the European Union [EU]. It is very  important -- and I supported the present government's intentions  on this -- that Hungary's association treaty with the EU should  really be amended. It must be improved, it must be improved in  our favor. The way in which Brussels relates to Hungary and the  other states in the east central Europe region is very important  because I believe that the time for deeds has arrived. So there  should not be just piles and piles of statements by the Twelve  about the region; they should give more than they have been  giving so far to help this region.    [Correspondent] We would like to improve relations with  neighboring countries, but in past years we have seen that on  the other side there is insufficient will to receive these  attempts. How will the new government resolve this?    [Horn] Look, there are surely Funars [prominent Romanian  nationalist mayor of Cluj-Napoca] elsewhere too, not only in  Romania. [passage omitted] However, this must not be our point  of departure. I believe that Hungary has no enemies either  along its border or further away. On the contrary, it has  partners, and if we can strengthen the partnership relationship,  if we can build up their trust in our intentions -- and we have  already said that we would like to bring about a historical  reconciliation with our neighbors and a lot should be done to  this end -- I am sure that they will receive our moves  favorably.

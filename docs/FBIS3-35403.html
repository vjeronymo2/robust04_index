			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following review of the 15 February  issue of Cairo 'AQIDATI summarizes articles that are Islamic in  nature.  <H5>  Contents: </H5>   1. Grand Imam on Dialogue in Islam.    2. Ending the Boycott With Israel.    3. Social Solidarity in Islam    4. On the Koran and Hostile Currents    5. Religious Versus Enlightening Books    6. Muslim Infighting in Afghanistan    7. Islamic States and Bosnia-Herzegovina  <H5>  GRAND IMAM ON DIALOGUE IN ISLAM </H5>   In its 15 February, the state-owned weekly 'AQIDATI  publishes  on page 3 an 800-word article by Grand Imam of al-Azhar His  Eminence Shaykh Jad-al-Haqq 'Ali Jad-al-Haqq, in which he writes  about the ethics of dialogue in Islam. Citing the Koranic verse  " Invite all to the way of thy Lord with wisdom and beautiful  preaching and argue with them in ways that are best and most  gracious," he explains that preaching is meant for those who are  already bound by the right principles, while arguing is usually  used with those who disagree with one's ideas and tend to use  rough or aggressive language in voicing their differences.    Imam Jad-al-Haqq remarks that "violent language is  unnecessary and fruitless, because it hurts the feelings and  spoils amity." He notes that choosing the right word or  expression can sometimes solve problems.  <H5>  ENDING THE BOYCOTT WITH ISRAEL </H5>   A 100-word report on page 3 cites the grand imam as he  emphasizes that "it is inevitable to maintain all types and  forms of Arab economic and trade boycott of Israel until full  withdrawal from all the occupied Arab territories, primarily  Jerusalem and al-Aqsa Mosque, is achieved."    Citing Imam Jad-al-Haqq's interview with AL-ITTIHAD  newspaper  of the United Arab Emirates, the report adds that the imam  pointed out that "Israel's history shows that it has not honored  a pledge or respected a promise. Therefore, calling for or  demanding the abolition of economic and trade boycotts with it  before full withdrawal from all the lands it occupies is  impermissible and improper, and also a grave mistake."  <H5>  SOCIAL SOLIDARITY IN ISLAM </H5>   A 2,500-word report on page 4 gives an account of a seminar  'AQIDATI held in the Anas Ibn-Malik Mosque in the city of Suez  under the banner of "Fasting and Social Solidarity." After  discussing social solidarity in Islam, particularly in the  fasting month of Ramadan, speakers answer the audience'  questions.    Asked if there is hope to extend social solidarity to  Muslims  around the world, particularly in Bosnia-Herzegovina, al-Azhar  Professor Fathi Mihriz replies that all Muslims should hasten to  give a hand to brothers in Bosnia-Herzegovina if they get the  chance.    Chief editor al-Sayyid 'Abd-al-Ra'uf blames all Muslims for  what is happening in the Muslim world today, because "they have  deviated from the correct understanding of Islam, lived in a  trance and in superstitions that have no link with or root in  religion, and let Europe advance in science and take the reins  of the world."    Asked what 'AQIDATI does to confront the communists and  secularists who attack Islam from within, 'Abd-al-Ra'uf says:  "We are being subjected to a fierce campaign from the  secularists and communists to whom the doors of some newspapers  and magazines, some of which belong to the government, were  opened." He reiterates that 'AQIDATI has a clear and obvious  role in fighting ignorance and superstitions, as well as those  who fight Islam.  <H5>  ON THE KORAN AND HOSTILE CURRENTS </H5>   Page 10 features a 1,500-word report on remarks Shaykh  Muhammad al-Ghazali made at "The Opera Cultural Salon" on 14  February regarding anti-Islamic currents and their possible  impact on Koran and tradition. At the beginning, al-Ghazali  stressed that "there is no fear for Koran and tradition from the  anti-Islamic currents, because the Almighty will guard His  message against corruption." He affirms that "the Koran and  tradition will stay in spite of the secularists."    Al-Ghazali attributes the Islamic nation's weakness and its  political, economic, and social defeats to many causes,  including "the misunderstanding of the Koran and tradition and  the failure to observe and examine narrations thoroughly." The  problem is how to promote your Islam since you did not adhere to  it or apply it accurately, he said.    He added that Muslims are fighting two battles: One against  the terrorist movements that have wrongly been attributed to  Islam and the second against the allegations of the "secular  enlighteners" who refuse to see that "Islam is an enlightened  intellectual movement that urges the people to learn their  religion correctly and draw evidence from the universe." He  stressed that the nation can never accept the view that the  revelation is an obsolete concept, that the Koran is an Arabic  literary text, or that the Prophet's tradition is inapplicable.    Dr. Ahmad Kamal Abu-al-Majd remarked that the nation is  experiencing discord and disagreement and that some groups  belittle thought and make their own rulings that forbid  everything. He asks al-Ghazali why such groups appeared and how  their thought can be rectified. He answers that the cause lies  in the fact that Islamic culture is being presented in a fake  image that is full of contradictions. This has led to  differences that have affected the thought of the religious  youth. Therefore, he stresses the need for cleansing the  Islamic culture of all the old delusions and germs implanted in  it.   <H5>    RELIGIOUS VERSUS ENLIGHTENING BOOKS </H5>   In a 200-word article on page 18, columnist Mamduh al-'Ashri  criticizes Dr. Samir Sarahn, chairman of the Public Book  Authority, for expressing his view on a television program that  "Islamic books discount the brainpower of youth and their low  prices adversely affected other books on display in the fair."  The columnist wonders how such a statement can get past the  censor, as it casts doubt on facts stated in the Koran.    Al-'Ashri is surprised that Sarhan says this while  "licentious books and pornographic magazines fill the fair's  corridors." These books not only contradict Islam, but also the  Egyptian people's customs and tradition, he remarks.    He notes that religious books were the most expensive at the  fair, while the other so-called enlightening books were the  cheapest. Nonetheless, he adds, more than 15 million Egyptian  pounds worth of religious books were sold at the fair.    Wondering what "those people" have against the honorable  al-Azhar, which represents pure Islam which is the official  religion of the country, al-'Ashri notes that the Vatican,  "Rome's pride," banned Madonna's book and no one dared to object  because the Vatican is a symbol of religion. How can we allow  ourselves to talk against al-Azhar, which stands for Islam, he  asks.    Touching on the same subject, Ibrahim Nasr writes a 150-word  article on page 23 in which he talks about "the high voices that  express concern over the numerous booklets that talk about  torture in the grave and bliss in paradise--which they call  after-death imaginings--and claim that these booklets discount  the brainpower of youth."    Nasr is surprised that it is these same voices that demand  freedom of expression and of the press and are responsible for  publishing the "impolite" books which were confiscated and  banned from circulation by the law.    He asks: What freedom do they want: Freedom of thought or  of disbelief?  <H5>  MUSLIM INFIGHTING IN AFGHANISTAN </H5>   Chairman of the Board Samir Rajab writes in his 350-words  column on page 1 that the warring factions in Afghanistan broke  the Ramadan cease-fire agreement in just a few days. He remarks  that the mujahidin who filled the world with talk about their  jihad are proving day after day that all they ever thought of  was their personal interests and their lust for power.    Rajab regrets that "the communist rule in Afghanistan was  more stable and secure and more protective of people's lives."  It is true that it had many shortcomings and gaps, but, on the  other hand, it did not allow that infinite bloodletting, he says.    He argues that that was the cat and mouse game between  America and the former Soviet Union. The two came out intact,  letting the naive Afghan fall into a bottomless pit, he says,  adding: Russia has cashed in its chips, letting America take  all the loot, not only in that region but in the whole world.  Meanwhile, the miserable mujahidin are finishing themselves off  with their own hands, he says.    In conclusion, Rajab expresses his surprise that "other  people have sealed their minds off, refusing to learn from the  Afghan experience. The result is more blood, more destruction,  and ruin." It is true that one man's poison is another's meat,  he remarks.  <H5>  ISLAMIC STATES AND BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA </H5>   A 150-word report by Jamal Salim, page 20, says that the  World Islamic Council for Call and Relief has issued a statement  "condemning the massacres to which Sarajevo Muslims were  subjected. The statement appeals to Arab and Islamic governments  and people to adopt strict measures, particularly the severance  of diplomatic and cultural ties with Serbia and the states that  support it, primarily Russia and Greece, and the expulsion of  these states' ambassadors from Islamic capitals."    The report adds that the council called on Islamic people,  political and party institutions, trade unions, and other  economic, trade, cultural, and tourist centers "to boycott the  Yugoslav companies and freeze all dealings with them."    The statement also called on the Islamic states to adopt a  political and military plan to lift the ban on arming  Bosnia-Herzegovina, set up a world popular court to punish the  Serbian criminals, and collect donations for Bosnian Muslims.    The statement finally calls on Islamic states "not to  recognize the geographic and demographic changes imposed by the  brutal Serbian power."    Basyuni al-Halwani's 500-word column on page 6 criticizes  Islamic states that content themselves with statements of  denunciation and condemnation and watch the "Serbian criminals"  as they demonstrate their malice for Islam and Muslims,  desecrate the sanctities, and destroy lives.    He says that the international community has proved that it  protects the law of the jungle when it closed its eyes to the  Serbian crimes for over two years and encouraged them with its  inaction and negligence to liquidate the Islamic identity of  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    He regrets that despite the hideousness of the Serbian  crimes, states like Russia uncovered their ugly faces, started  to encourage the Serbians in their aggression, and hampered  every attempt to restore peace to the region.</p>

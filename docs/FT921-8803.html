			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / International Company News: Top Swedish banks downgraded SWEDEN'S two leading commercial banks had their long-term debt ratings lowered yesterday by Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency. Both Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken (SEB) and Svenska Handelsbanken were rated at AA and will now be AA-. S &amp; P said about Dollars 30bn of SEB's debt and Dollars 802m of Handelsbanken's debt would be affected. It said the changes reflect the deterioration of the banks' asset quality, caused by the continuing recession. The credit losses in 1991 largely stem from the banks' significant exposure to the troubled Swedish commercial real estate market. S &amp; P added that Sweden's lingering economic downturn was likely to 'cause further weakness in the property sector and elsewhere, prolonging the asset quality dilemmas of both banks until 1994, and perhaps beyond'. However, S &amp; P pointed out that the core earnings of the two banks before loan losses and provisions continued to be strong, primarily driven by healthy and increasing net interest margins. It acknowledges that decreasing competition has allowed the banks to show 'more flexibility in pricing loans while the rising domestic savings rate and a flight to quality by depositors have caused an inflow of retail deposits'. The agency added that continued improvement in core results was expected to limit overall deterioration, created by asset-quality problems. Two weeks ago both banks warned that their 1991 results had been hit badly by credit losses. Handelsbanken reports its figures on February 18 and SEB on February 25.</p>

			<p><P> November 25, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> ALASKA BOOKMOBILE FLIES TO FAR POINTS;  </P> <P> LIBRARIES: THE STATE USES BACK-COUNTRY PILOTS TO GIVE ALL OF ITS RESIDENTS  EQUAL ACCESS TO EDUCATION, ENTERTAINMENT AND INFORMATION.  </P> <P> In the back country of Alaska, out of the reach of television, commercial radio  or even daily newspapers, thousands of families are staying in touch the  old-fashioned way.  </P> <P> They're reading books.  </P> <P> Bush pilots regularly fly library books to some 3,000 Alaskans to fulfill a  promise dating from territorial days that all residents should have equal  access to public libraries.  </P> <P> For people such as Elaine and Pete Velsko and their two daughters, who live on  Tutka Bay, 125 miles from Anchorage, those green mailbags full of books, which  arrive once or twice a month, offer both education and entertainment.  </P> <P> "My husband asks for all nonfiction. He wants to keep up with the world,"  Elaine Velsko says. "But I like my stories. If I didn't get my green bags, I  think I'd perish out here."  </P> <P> Elaine Velsko has spent 13 years on Tutka Bay, 14 miles from Homer, managing  her modern ranch home and teaching her children, ages 8 and 4, through  correspondence courses. Her husband runs the state fish hatchery nearby.  </P> <P> The way some people might flick on a soap opera, she'll pull a novel out of the  sack and read.  </P> <P> "We are living more the pioneering life," she says. "It's what we want."  </P> <P> About 175 miles north, in the village of Skwentna, Joe and Norma Delia have  spent 40 years on their 10-acre homestead hunting, trapping, running the post  office and reading flown-in library books to their two children.  </P> <P> "For my kids, books were a big thing in their lives," Joe Delia says. "They  didn't have things that kids in town have to occupy their time."  </P> <P> Begun in 1957, Alaska's bush library service operated for more than a decade  out of the state library at Juneau. But it specialized in historical and  government material and, for readers, wasn't the same as being able to browse a  library shelf or bookstore for a good read.  </P> <P> George Smith, who oversees the $265,000 state grant that pays for the service's  postage and library staff, says the service was transferred 10 years ago to the  public libraries at Juneau, Fairbanks and Anchorage to give readers a chance at  more contemporary collections.  </P> <P> Only a fraction of the estimated 40,000 people who live in rural Alaska are  signed up for books by mail.  </P> <P> One of them is writer Janice Schofield. From her one-room cabin in the Rocky  River Valley near Homer, Schofield began a study of grasses and flowers and was  inspired to write a book on Alaska's native plants.  </P> <P> Her reference guides were almost exclusively library books delivered by mail  plane and left for her at a remote mail shed on Kantishna Bay.  </P> <P> "It was always great -- like having this little goody box coming in the mail,"  she says.  </P> <P> To fetch the books, Schofield and her husband, Edward, hiked or skied to their  car, drove to the end of the road, and then hiked or skied another half a mile  to reach the shed. There the books went into backpacks and the Schofields made  their way back out.  </P> <P> "Discovering Wild Plants," published last year by Northwest Discovery  Publications, was the first book she ever researched by mail, letting the  library know generally what she needed and then waiting to see what turned up.  </P> <P> Most people in the bush want popular fiction, children's books and popular  nonfiction, Smith says.  </P> <P> "They tell us what they want -- either they give us titles or they just specify  a subject -- and then we choose the collections," he says.  </P> <P> Joe Delia, who says he'll often rise at 3 a.m. to finish a Louis L'Amour novel  or maybe a spy thriller by Robert Ludlum, has been a patron of the bush library  service for at least 20 years, longer than almost anyone else. Once in a while,  he says, he'll open a fresh sack of six or 10 books only to find he's already  read them.  </P> <P> "The more I read the more I want to read," says Delia, 59.  </P> <P> "When we had nothing to read in the trap line cabins -- and this is no joke --  we'd read the labels on cans.  </P> <P> "I used to be able to tell you all the ingredients in a can of Carnation milk.  I didn't pronounce it all correctly, but I knew them."  </P> <P> In Juneau or Fairbanks or Anchorage, where a computer helps track the book  requests, librarians too can follow a family's progress by the books they want.  After a few years of being a family's personal book shopper, library workers  get Christmas cards or friendly notes.  </P> <P> "We keep up a lot of correspondence," says Brenda Bergsrud, who works with the  program at Anchorage's Z.J. Loussac Library.  </P> <P> "A parent will write and say, 'Tanya likes horses, so send us horse books.' And  then Tanya will send us a picture of a horse. We start to feel like family."  </P></p>

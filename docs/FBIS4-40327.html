			<p>BFN     [Text] Chisinau, BASAPRESS, 13/6/1994 -- "The change of  the national anthem only proves that the leadership does not  have a diplomatic mentality, because a state that changes its  anthem is not taken seriously by international organizations,"  stated today in a press conference held by the Peasants and  Intellectuals Block Valeriu Matei, deputy to the Moldovan  Parliament. They presented the declaration written by 11  deputies of the Socialist Party and Democratic Agrarian Party  demanding celebration of the "50th anniversary of Moldova's  liberation from the Romanian-fascist occupation" on 27 August.  The deputies demanded the day of 27 August be declared a  national holiday. The Congress of Intelligentsia chairman  Alexandru Mosanu, called the declaration "the beginning of the  restoration of the communist regime." According to local  observers, authors of this declaration try to give to Moldova's  independence day celebrated on 27 August another colour. The  Parliament voted to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Moldova's  liberation from the fascist occupation on 24 August. The  deputies of the Intellectuals and Peasants Parliamentary Faction  also opposed the draft law on press. They called it "the most  anti-democratic law in any state." Alexandru Mosanu said during  the press conference that, if this draft law passes, reporters  will have to work under conditions of dictatorship. Valerie  Matei stated that "a law on press which admits censorship cannot  be democratic." He goaded the reporters at the conference to  appeal without delay to international organizations to obstruct  the adoption of this law.</p>

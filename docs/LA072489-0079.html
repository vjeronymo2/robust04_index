			<p><P> July 24, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHY THE KIROV ISN'T SCHEDULING BALANCHINE HERE  </P> <P> While the Kirov Ballet is making dance history in New York by dancing recently  acquired works by George Balanchine, Orange County and San Francisco audiences  apparently will not see the company perform works by the seminal choreographer.  </P> <P> Only New York and Washington -- of the four American cities on the current  Kirov tour -- are scheduled to see the Leningrad company in Balanchine's  "Scotch Symphony" and "Theme and Variations."  </P> <P> Instead, scheduled here during the Aug. 18-27 run at the Orange County  Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa are "The Sleeping Beauty," "Le Corsaire"  and a program of mixed repertory -- none of it by the legendary "Mr. B," a  Kirov alumnus who left the Soviet Union in 1924.  </P> <P> In addition, two of the works on the mixed bill -- Petipa's "Paquita" and  Fokine's "Chopiniana" -- were danced by the Kirov in Los Angeles on the  company's last tour at the Shrine Auditorium in May, 1986.  </P> <P> San Francisco will get only the two full-length ballets.  </P> <P> Why no Balanchine on the West Coast?  </P> <P> The answer is . . . there's the rub. There is some question as to who made the  decision about what the company will offer, at least in Orange County.  </P> <P> Center president Thomas R. Kendrick said that it was Kirov artistic director  Oleg Vinogradov: "Certainly Vinogradov determines repertory," Kendrick said.  </P> <P> However, Vinogradov, speaking with Times Music and Dance Critic Martin  Bernheimer in New York, said: "They (Orange County Performing Arts Center)  asked for the bigger productions. We thought you were sick and tired of  Balanchine. But maybe we will do it. Sometimes there are surprises."  </P> <P> In response, Kendrick said: "We wanted the company to present here what they  feel best reflects the company and their best works and what they want to do. .  . . It always was the Kirov's position that 'Chopiniana' and 'Paquita' and most  of all the selected pas de deux are most reflective of what the Kirov stands  for and is noted for, and they would offer that and we accepted it.  </P> <P> "This was all decided a year or more ago," Kendrick said.  </P> <P> "They were interested in doing 'Sleeping Beauty' for the full run," he said.  "We were interested in having a variety of representation from the Kirov. It  worked out very early that they wanted to do 'Le Corsaire.' And we wanted a  mixed-repertory program."  </P> <P> Kendrick added: "Balanchine may be OK if you have three weeks to show off, but  not if you have nine days. We have elected to do three programs in nine days."  </P> <P> The Kirov run in New York is 18 days. The Washington run is 11 days. The San  Francisco run is 10 days.  </P> <P> San Francisco Opera was not given an option regarding the mixed repertory  programs, according to a spokeswoman. "We were offered the the two full-length  ballets," Elizabeth Lynch said. "And we said yes."  </P> <P> Balanchine was trained as a dancer at the Imperial Ballet School of the  Maryinsky Theatre in St. Petersburg (now Leningrad). The theater was renamed  the Kirov in 1935.  </P> <P> He emigrated to the West to work with the Diaghilev Ballets Russes, and  eventually to found, with Lincoln Kirstein, a company that became New York City  Ballet.  </P> <P> In the Soviet Union, Balanchine's works were considered "decadent," ostensively  because of their plotless, "abstract" choreography, and were virtually never  legally performed by Soviet companies until last year.  </P> <P> Then, as part of the new artistic and social openness with which the Soviet  Union is addressing the West, Francia Russell, artistic co-director of the  Pacific Northwest Ballet, and Suzanne Farrell, considered by many as the  supreme Balanchine ballerina, were sent to Leningrad last fall by the  Balanchine Trust to stage these works and to train the Kirov dancers in the  Balanchine style.  </P></p>

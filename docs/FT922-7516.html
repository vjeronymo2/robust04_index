			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / A no-nonsense launch for new Munich airport MUNICH'S new airport - Flughafen Munchen Franz Josef Strauss, a memorial to Bavaria's best-loved prime minister and a monument to German patience - opened its new runways to commercial air traffic yesterday. Overnight, almost 700 trucks, 1,600 rail wagons and 5,000 personnel had shifted all the moveable paraphernalia - workshop equipment, mobile aircraft steps and the contents of 9,000 offices - out of the old Riem airport, and switched out the lights. After more than 30 years of planning, litigation, stop-go building and more litigation, the new air transport hub went straight to work with no fuss. All the ceremonial button-pushing had been done well in advance, before Sekt-sipping audiences of invited guests. There were no bands, booze or brouhaha to greet the first wave of paying visitors. The protesters who have dogged the project since its inception managed a small show of force, but preserved their main events for villages in the surrounding countryside. Meanwhile the new airport's customers, siphoned from their aircraft, trains and cars directly into the main concourse of the single, 1km-long terminal, quickly discovered what life is like inside a pinball machine. Getting lost is impossible. Getting around is mindless. Brain cells concerned with anxiety are left free to ponder who put the cat out. Immaculate signposts in English and German shunt travellers left, right, up, down and along walkways and escalators which deposit them at their appointed slots in the array of nine gate areas. There are no satellites, arms, fingers or any of the other appendages commonly tacked on to other international airports. The concourse, a white, grey and blue confection in steel tube, with all the charm of the inside of a washing machine, features environmentally-friendly rubbish bins but hardly anywhere where you can sit without paying through the nose for a beer and a bun. Bavaria's showpiece has already cost DM8.5bn (Pounds 2.9bn) - 39 per cent from the state and the balance from private financing - and the returns are flowing in. The airport's turnover, expected to reach DM1bn a year by 1995, is only a part of the reward. According to Mr Willi Hermsen, managing director, the project provided up to 6,000 jobs in the building period and there are more to come. Almost 120 airlines have elected to use Munich II, as it is now known, against 80 at Riem. Able to handle 75 aircraft movements an hour, it already has 15 per cent more capacity than Frankfurt. By 2000, passenger throughput is expected to be almost double today's estimates of 11m a year, and there is already talk of another terminal. Mr Hermsen believes local outside contractors can now count on DM75m a year in work from the airport. On the site itself, 300 companies currently employ 12,000, a total likely to grow to 20,000 by the end of the decade. Beyond the perimeter fence and all along the 30km road to Munich cranes and earthmoving equipment mark out the sites of new hotels, offices and industry parks in an area formerly reserved for cabbages and sugar beet. Land prices  -between DM30 and DM50 a square metre 10 years ago - now range between DM500 and DM1,000. Meanwhile, the local resistance movement, which put up an estimated 7,000 legal challenges to Munich II during planning and development, is bracing itself for the next round. Its targets are the mooted extra terminal and the likely need for new road and rail connections. The already overloaded stretch of the Nuremberg motorway serving the airport suffered unusually heavy jams yesterday. The effects of the curious joining the flow of travellers added weight to the local joke that Munich II is the world's first airport accessible only from the air.</p>

			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / Indonesian power project stalls NEGOTIATIONS have stalled between the Indonesian government and Mission Energy of the US over a Dollars 2bn power project, jeopardising government plans to attract private sector investment into the national grid, industry officials say. In May, the government asked Mission Energy to form a consortium to build, own and operate two 600MW coal-powered units at Paiton in East Java. It would be the first private sector power plant linked to the national grid. About Dollars 30bn of investment in power is required by the end of the decade to keep pace with demand and the Paiton project is central to government plans to raise a third of the total in the private sector. Industry officials say, however, that three rounds of negotiations from August to November between the government and the Mission Energy consortium  -which includes Mitsui of Japan, General Electric of the US and Batu Hitam Perkasa, an Indonesian coal mining company - have resulted in impasse. The government has withdrawn a draft implementation agreement upon which Mission Energy made its original bid and which the consortium requires to raise offshore finance. That agreement covers items such as force majeure risk, payment guarantees and dispute settlement rules. Instead, government officials indicate that a 'comfort letter' of support but falling short of a sovereign guarantee will be provided. There are doubts whether this will satisfy prospective financiers. Some industry officials believe the project's problems are more deep-rooted. 'President Suharto gave his commitment to Paiton in 1990, but other government officials have been more reticent. No official has either the authority or the will to make the necessary decisions to carry the project forward,' said one. Mission's bid technically lapses on December 31 and the company is reportedly keen to raise its cost estimates following reappraisal of the fuel efficiency of its coal supply. Any change in the bid, however, may cause further delays. Presidential elections and a cabinet reshuffle in March are also likely to obstruct an early resolution to the impasse. Negotiations for the plant are now unlikely to be concluded until late next year, conceded one government official. This could disillusion bankers and possibly lead to Mission Energy's withdrawal from the project, officials say.</p>

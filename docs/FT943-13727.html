			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Survey of South Africa (19): From force to service - Developments in the police Mr Sydney Mufamadi, minister of safety and security, wears a plastic watch with the hammer and sickle of the Italian Communist party, accepts his tea from an obsequious white Afrikaans civil servant and defends 'his' policemen  -and women - against the charge that they are all apartheid's criminals. Such incongruities have become the normal stuff of life in the new South Africa. White civil servants have new black bosses whom they treat with the same studied servility as their Afrikaans predecessors. White police generals, who defended the apartheid state with such vigour, are rushing to ingratiate themselves with new political masters. And Sydney Mufamadi, 35, finds himself in the uncomfortable position of having to find nice things to say about the most hated institution in South African society: the South African police. It is a tribute to the extraordinary qualities of the soft-spoken and articulate Mr Mufamadi that he does not seem to find this difficult. He is one of South Africa's most adroit conciliators, a true peacemaker in the mould of his mentor, Nelson Mandela. And best of all, he is a pragmatist who knows that violence can never end so long as police are seen as most of the problem, and not part of the solution. 'My police men and women' - Mr Mufamadi never omits this awkward but politically correct reference to gender - 'in the past they were expected to enforce laws which were not based on human rights. Perhaps the fact that they were vicious can mean that they were potentially good policemen and women.' In other words, their job was repression and they were good at it. 'Now we need to ensure that they enforce humane laws' - and hope that they are equally good at fulfilling that task. Ironically, Mr Mufamadi believes that a 'truth commission', aimed at revealing apartheid abuses, could actually enhance the legitimacy of the police by proving that '99 per cent of these people are not that bad.' 'Precisely because it is generally understood that the police are up to something sinister, whether or not it can be proved, the truth commission' - which South Africa's former rulers fear could turn into a witch hunt - 'can address this problem by promoting the legitimacy and integrity of the police. Those involved in unlawful activities cannot be more than 2 per cent of the entire force.' But if Mr Mufamadi, and provincial police ministers such as Ms Jessie Duarte in the Johannesburg region, are trying hard to re-establish trust in the police, they are simultaneously trying to change the force from within. 'You have a police force, not a police service. It's run on completely militaristic lines. You don't have people saying 'Our job is to protect human life; to protect people and communities.' They see their role as protecting privilege. But it's not enough to protect (the man) who has nine cars and not protect the poor,' says Mr Mufamadi. 'There is a particular culture of policing and that is the culture you want to change,' he concludes, adding with a note close to despair: 'But how do you inculcate in the whole South African society a human rights culture?' Changing the command structure of the new South African Police Service (SAPS) will be crucial. 'The Pretoria officer corps must reflect the fact that there are not just white male Afrikaans speakers in the police,' he says. 'The police leadership must be restructured to reflect South African reality.' But, as one of Mr Mufamadi's officials says, taking on the police is a mammoth task. 'It's a state within a state - they even have their own holiday resorts]' And it is not clear that South Africa's former rulers are willing to come completely clean on the subject of the security services. 'Officially there is just a police force - but then you discover there is even officially a force engaged in gun running] It's like an onion; we're getting one peel after another. We may never get the whole thing,' says the official. In the meantime, police forces in the 10 former homelands are in chaos, making illegal promotions and looting government property. 'Policing in some of these areas has virtually collapsed,' says a senior police official. So if violence has abated, the credit goes primarily to the people, not to the police. Mr Jacob Zuma, African National Congress leader in KwaZulu Natal, reflects on the drop in violence in the province: 'Amazingly, the population of Natal just forgot about tension and violence on all the days of the election. The people gave leadership to the leaders on that day: they showed us how much they wanted peace.' Sydney Mufamadi was listening to their message; his job now is to deliver.</p>

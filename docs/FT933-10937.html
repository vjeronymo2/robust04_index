			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / Travel: Speed to Calais and miss France KEEPING OFF the motorways pays immense dividends in France. My preference at Tours, for example, is always to take the road for Le Mans, for a drive to the Channel that is both shorter than the motorway route to Calais and infinitely more entrancing. Mind you, at Le Mans itself you can miss the old town altogether by taking the ring road. Le Mans cathedral is breathtaking: half Romanesque, half Gothic. A countryside of polled willows, poplars, meadowlands and watermills separates Le Mans from Alencon, the birthplace of St Theresa of Lisieux, who died of tuberculosis in 1897 aged only 24. Something to relish is the cathedral at Ses, 19km further north. The road curves around the city and climbs up to this glorious building with its twin, crocketed west spires, its flying buttresses and gargoyles, one of which vulgarly vomits the rainwater. The buttresses, added in the 19th century, are the sole addition to the building since 1330. Well worth visiting is the Haras du Pin, a few kilometres due north of Ses. Here is France's national stud, founded by Louis XIV's chief minister, Colbert, in 1665. Argentan, 12km east, is where the battle of Normandy ended on August 19 1944. Here, too, Henry II learned that Thomas Becket had excommunicated him. The English connection grows increasingly stronger as you approach the coast. At Falaise in 1027 William the Conqueror was born William the Bastard. His father was Duke Robert III of Normandy, known as Robert the Devil, his mother a tanner's daughter named Arlette. In the white-walled, half-ruined castle the guide will show you the window through which the duke first spied Arlette washing her clothes in the river, though the same guide usually adds that the window was only constructed six centuries later. Caen is not a port, and to reach the ships you need to drive a little further towards Ouistreham. Ouistreham has a fortified 12th century church. It also has a casino and a marina, as well as excellent restaurants. James Bentley's The Gateway to France was recently published by Penguin at Pounds 8.99.</p>

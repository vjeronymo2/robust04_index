			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The evidence available to EPA suggests that an overwhelming  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> majority of the vehicle models manufactured for sale in Canada  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are not configurations unique to the Canadian market, but are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mechanically identical to their corresponding United States  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> version regarding emissions compliance, except for EPA's labeling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and warranty requirements. Given this situation, EPA believes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that it is not necessary to require individuals and commercial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> importers to obtain separate certificates of conformity from EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for those vehicles that are mechanically identical to their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> corresponding United States version regarding emissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On June 29, 1988, EPA granted the petition for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reconsideration (the document granting the petition may be found  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the docket at A&hyph;89&hyph;20), and agreed to commence this rulemaking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to address the unique issues surrounding Canadian vehicles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Today's action proposes formal revisions to EPA's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations for importing vehicles from Canada. It also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clarifies or changes certain other provisions contained in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existing regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. EPA's Proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA's proposal would allow only commercial importers with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designated Canadian importer status approved by EPA to import  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles from Canada both for which the title has previously been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transferred to an ultimate purchaser and for which the title has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not yet been transferred to an ultimate purchaser, for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purpose of resale. The designated Canadian importers would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permitted to import only those vehicles which were previously  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proven to be identical, in all material respects, to their United  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States certified counterparts. In addition to making the showing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of identical in all material respects, a designated Canadian  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> importer must agree to: (1) Label each vehicle for fuel economy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and emissions compliance purposes; (2) fulfill emission warranty  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and recall obligations, and notify owners of recalls and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available warranty coverage; (3) maintain adequate records; (4) pay  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any applicable Gas Guzzler Taxes, and Corporate Average Fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Economy penalties (49 CFR 531, 533); (5) submit applications for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> final admission to EPA; (6) hold vehicles for a period of five  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> working days (or less if approved by EPA on a case-by-case basis)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for EPA inspection before transfer to an ultimate purchaser or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dealer; and (7) submit to inspections conducted by EPA enforcement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> officers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Importations by Individuals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Today's proposal also addresses the importation of vehicles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by individual owners. Often an individual moving to the United  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States from Canada wishes to import his/her vehicle for personal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use. In many of these cases, the vehicle is identical, except  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for labeling, to its United States certified counterpart. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> few vehicles which are not identical to their United States  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certified counterparts, typically require only minor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modifications to make them identical. For these reasons, EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believes that the special circumstances associated with an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual moving to the United States from Canada also warrant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consideration in this rulemaking. EPA believes that similar  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> circumstances may also apply to some individuals importing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles from other countries. Consequently, this proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addresses vehicle importations by individuals moving to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> United States from other countries, as well.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / Channel tunnel train is towed powerless to UK THE FIRST Channel tunnel express train to be seen in Britain emerged from the tunnel mouth at Folkestone yesterday morning  - crawling behind a French diesel locomotive that had pulled it through the tunnel, writes Richard Tomkins. The electrically powered train, built in France, was unable to make its own way to British shores because the electrical systems in the tunnel have not yet been switched on. A total of 38 Eurostar Channel tunnel express trains are being built by GEC Alsthom, the Anglo-French engineering company, at Pounds 24m apiece. They will run between London and Paris in three hours when the tunnel opens next year. The prototype that arrived yesterday has undergone months of trials in France and will be tested in England to establish how the trains perform using the comparatively low-voltage electrical system in use on Network SouthEast.

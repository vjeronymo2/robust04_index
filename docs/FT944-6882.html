			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Pounds 1.4m economic project launched The Economic and Social Research Council, a government agency, has launched a Pounds 1.4m research programme that might help chancellors make better predictions about the electoral and economic impact of Budget proposals. The programme will focus on people's economic values, beliefs and behaviour. It is based on the council's contention that 'there is a lot more to what people do than simply the money in their pocket'. The 'economic beliefs and behaviour programme' will involve 52 researchers at 17 universities. They will work on 13 projects covering areas such as taxation, pension and benefit provision, as well as investment and entrepreneurship. The programme will try to assess how far cultural beliefs and moral values as well as shifting ideas about consumerism or entrepreneurship interact with conventional incentives based on money.</p>

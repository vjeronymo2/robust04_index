			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / UK Company News: BT international venture set for US telephone growth Concert, the Dollars 1bn joint venture between British Telecommunications and MCI, the second largest US long distance carrier, is set to gain permission from US regulators to engage in a new form of transatlantic telecoms competition. The US Federal Communications Commission approval would allow Concert to offer multinational customers a leased line telecoms service called 'international simple resale'. This would open the way for Concert to provide multinational companies with cut-price transatlantic corporate telephone networks, which is a principal aim of the joint venture in its bid to develop international telecoms business for BT and MCI. Until now the main focus of Concert has been international data services. It is starting to move into the higher-volume voice telephony market. Concert is the cornerstone of the Dollars 5.3bn (Pounds 3.35bn) alliance between BT and MCI forged in mid-1993. It is in strong competition with two other international alliances - Worldsource, led by AT&amp;T, the largest US operator and Atlas, a venture between Sprint, the third-largest US long-distance operator, and the state-owned telecoms companies of France and Germany. Concert has gained more than 30 corporate customers for advanced international services since its launch. Analysts regard the joint venture as ahead of its rivals in terms of service availability. AT&amp;T is set to gain a licence in the UK to offer similar services to those planned by Concert. Its Worldsource partnership includes leading national carriers in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. The agreements by Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom to take stakes in Sprint have yet to secure regulatory approval in the US and EU.</p>

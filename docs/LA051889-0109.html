			<p><P> May 18, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Maoist Shining Path rebels killed four people and exploded bombs across Peru to  mark the ninth anniversary of the Maoist movement's first armed raid, police  said. The killings brought to at least 31 the number of people slain in Shining  Path attacks in the past three days. In recent weeks, the rebels have increased  attacks on university and secondary school professors who have resisted  guerrilla indoctrination in classrooms. Shining Path, or Sendero Luminoso,  usually marks its anniversary with power blackouts and attacks on police posts.  Its goal is to oust the government and forge a worker-peasant state along the  lines of China under Mao Tse-tung.  </P></p>

			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / International Company News: Chemicals producer falls heavily MITSUBISHI Kasei, the leading Japanese chemicals maker, reported a 29.9 per cent fall in pre-tax profit, to Y9.3bn (Dollars 83.78m), for the year ended in March. It blamed the loss on falling demand for industrial chemicals and the slowing of the economy. Sales for the year fell 2.3 per cent to Y709.83bn, although the company continued to expand outside its traditional lines and increased production of pharmaceuticals, biochemicals and electronic items. The company is expecting to benefit from the stronger yen, which will lead to relatively lower prices for imported resources, but it is still concerned about the sluggish pace of the domestic economy and weak demand from core industrial customers. Profits have now fallen for three years in succession. Mitsubishi Kasei is forecasting another fall this year, with pre-tax profits expected at Y6bn, on slightly higher sales.</p>

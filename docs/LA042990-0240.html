			<p><P> April 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENTS: A GUIDE TO THE BEST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA;  </P> <P> DESIGN;  </P> <P> SHE MADE IT OUT OF CLAY  </P> <P> ALTHOUGH THE technique, called millefiori, is one the Venetians perfected in  their creation of intricate patterns in glass, artist Martha Breen's clocks and  picture frames look as though they were inspired as much by refrigerator  cookies or sushi as by glass beads. Breen makes her dazzling pieces from  polyform clay, mixing her own shades (about a dozen per piece), which she  combines in bold strokes.  </P> <P> The process consists of, first, forming long "canes" (as in candy canes) into  patterns -- checkerboards, stars, stripes, pinwheels, flowers. Making the canes  is the difficult part; it takes weeks to produce the proper designs and colors.  Then, just as with making cookies, Breen slices the clay and arranges the  pieces, cheek by jowl, into wild faces and picture frames. A bit of baking  (again like refrigerator cookies), and they're finished. The result is a bit  folkloric and a bit psychedelic. The clocks, which are about 5 to 6 inches  square (some have pendulums), sell for $130 to $165; the frames, which stand 4  to 7 inches high, go for $37 to $50.  </P> <P>  Martha Breen's clocks and frames are available at New Stone Age, 8407 W. 3rd  St., Los Angeles; (213) 658-5969.

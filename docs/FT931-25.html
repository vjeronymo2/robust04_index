			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Survey of Guernsey (21): Each island is fiercely independent  -Alderney, Sark and Herm THE small islands of Alderney, Sark and Herm come under the Bailiwick of Guernsey with the Bailiff of Guernsey as their civil head and chief justice. But Alderney, 3.5 miles long and 1.5 miles wide, with 2,500 people, has its own parliament. Sark, with about 600 people, has a hereditary ruler, a government called the Court of Chief Pleas, no income tax and no cars. Visitors explore the island by horse and cart, bicycle or on foot. There are no cars, either, on the tiny 500-acre island of Herm, leased to, and run by, the Wood family since 1949 on the understanding that tourists - about 100,000 in a busy summer - would be catered for and the island's beauty protected. About 500 people live here today, running the hotel, gift shops, pub, school, dairy and oyster farms. 'Each island is fiercely independent but we all depend on each other,' said Mr Christopher Brock, who will be taking over as Guernsey's new director of tourism in September. 'Marketing the group isn't easy - we found only one in 10 Europeans knew where Guernsey was, though if you said the Channel Islands, it was a little higher. And how do you translate 'The Bailiwick?'' 'The Germans, Scandinavians and Dutch are fascinated by islands,' he said. 'We have to get across the idea of the Channel Islands first, and then how the Bailiwick of Guernsey has its own uniqueness.' If not too many Europeans know about Guernsey as a holiday resort, fewer still would instantly think of Alderney as a finance centre. The idea brings wry smiles from some on Guernsey. But, already, in the cobbled streets of St Anne's, there are four leading banks, three accountancy firms and two legal practices, a British building society, and two insurance agencies. A new company offering a range of financial services has recently been established. The island might be small - its budget is just over Pounds 4m - but what does that matter if you have modern communications technology? It has no VAT, no taxes on capital or inheritance, none on exempt companies with business outside the islands, or on trusts whose beneficiaries live elsewhere. There is a low tax (20 per cent) on the profits of business companies and residents' income, and preferential arrangements are made for captive insurance companies based on the island. Some 500 companies are at present registered there. 'We've always been open for business,' said Mrs Eileen Sykes, chairman of Alderney's Finance Committee. 'And when we saw how successful Guernsey and Jersey were in l988, we thought we'd try and attract more finance houses. 'At that time, we also thought we'd have quite a serious budget deficit but fortunately we didn't. In fact, we've always finished the year with a surplus, though not a very large one.' 'We need to change peoples' attitudes,' said Mr David Jenkins, Clerk of the States. 'When senior management think of the Channel Islands, they think of Jersey, then Guernsey and they've never heard of Alderney. It's a matter of getting to them and persuading them to come.' Mr Mike Aireton, a former war office bacteriologist, had enough faith in Alderney to invest in the building of Ollivier Court, an office development in St Anne's. Only five of the 29 units, he said, were still empty. 'Alderney is the only island that has no entry restrictions at all,' he said enthusiastically. 'Anyone can come - and you're not going to get mugged on the way to the bank.' Mr Christopher Sykes had just arrived from London to become administrator and financial director for Dubarry Trustees whose staff has increased from one to seven in five years. He was optimistic about his career in Alderney. 'Vanuatu is a thriving offshore island in the middle of the Pacific with thousands of financial services. It's not famous for anything else. One day, looking back, people may say the same about Alderney.'</p>

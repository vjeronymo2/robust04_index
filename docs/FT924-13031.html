			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Digital's bright dawn: Michiyo Nakamoto on changing electronic lifestyles Imagine on a snowy winter morning being woken up by tropical birdsong and rays of sunlight shining through palm leaves and bougainvillea. There is no need to venture far from this electronic paradise in your bedroom: you can pick up the telephone and have files faxed to your study, or hold a meeting there via a video - conference call. To keep in touch with the office, just instruct your personal electronic communicator to forward all telephone and electronic messages. Such is the life that current advances in electronics, telecommunications and wireless technology promise to bring in the not-too-distant future, say industry executives, government researchers and market analysts. 'The world is seeing a revolution which will have an impact not far short of the impact of the telephone and the automobile,' says Mr John Sculley, chairman and chief executive officer of Apple Computer of the US. That revolution will create a new industry which he estimates will be worth Dollars 3,500bn by the end of the decade. The source of this optimism - and what differentiates developments in electronics and telecommunications today from previous trends - is the growing convergence of computers, consumer electronics and telecommunications. The three industries are beginning to overlap as the computer enters the home in more user-friendly guises and consumer electronics and telecommunications products take on more of the functions of computers. The catalyst for this integration is the growing switch in consumer electronics and telecommunications from analogue to digital technology. Digital signals are electrical (analogue) signals which have been converted into binary codes. The use of digital signals makes it possible to process and distribute a greater volume of information more rapidly than using an analogue system. Digital signals can also be stored in a relatively small space, such as on a floppy disc. What makes the spread of digital technology exciting is that it provides a common language for previously unrelated machines to communicate with each other. Data can be shared between various gadgets and functions can be merged. The television becomes a telephone and vice versa, computers become both, and mobile phones turn into electronic diaries. In telecommunications, digital technology adds a feature of the television - the ability to transmit images - to the telephone, in the form of high-quality video-conferencing units and videophones. The trend is expected to encourage telecommunications services from teleshopping and home banking to remote meter reading by utilities. When television goes digital, watching TV will no longer be an entirely passive experience. The digital TV set will enable users to play with information as it is broadcast by combining, rearranging and otherwise altering it as required. TV viewers could, for example, have access through their TV sets to an electronic catalogue of videos stored in a central database from which they could order a transmission of a particular film directly on to their set. Meanwhile developments in flat-panel displays are expected to put TV sets on the wall. When the TV is switched off, the panels could act as an electronic picture frame, receiving images from a central art gallery database. The tropical jungle on the wall today could be a glittering seascape tomorrow. In business, digitisation in the form of the personal computer has already brought significant changes to the workplace. Computer-makers are competing to add voice and video to text in the personal computer to create multimedia systems that would allow users to see and talk to each other while viewing the same visual data, such as graphs and charts, on their screens. Pioneers in the industry are hoping to miniaturise such multi-function machines and, with the help of significant advances being made in wireless communications, develop hand-held mobile information and communications tools - so called as a 'personal communicators'. Apple is launching Newton, an electronic diary, fax machine and PC rolled into one, and AT&amp;T is working on its own version. The potential profits from such machines have led to the emergence of a hybrid industry of computer manufacturing, consumer electronics, software programming, telecommunications, cable TV, broadcasting and publishing. Apple has joined hands with Sharp, the Japanese consumer electronics company, to manufacture its personal digital assistant (PDA). The US company is also working with Toshiba, the Japanese electronics group, on a multimedia player, and also with IBM on multimedia software and Kodak on digital photography products. Tandy, the US electronics group, and Casio are collaborating on a PDA. The integration of industries is not limited to such partnerships. Cable television companies already offer telecoms services in the US and UK. With the spread of fibre-optic networks, which have even greater information storage and distribution capacity than digital networks, telecoms operators could link users through fibre networks to any number of entertainment programme providers. 'The distinction that used to exist between these industries is becoming obsolete,' says Mr Hugh Small, European director of Arthur D Little, the management consultancy. Such cross-industry alliances will be important in setting global technical standards. Consumers are unlikely to want to invest in new products unless gadgets from different manufacturers can interact with each other. Collaboration also helps to reduce the risks of entering an untested market. 'Global partnerships and worldwide sourcing will be the key to success in this new industry,' says Mr Takashi Yamamoto, senior vice-president and general manager of Marubeni, the Japanese trading company. The digital revolution, however, must still overcome several obstacles. In particular, the new technologies will have to be tested in specific products, which will need to pass the judgment of the market. 'We are looking at a large number of new types of products and many will fail,' says Mr Paul Donovan, at Apple in the UK. But the competition to develop new products, and the huge sums being spent in R&amp;D suggest few companies doubt the potential of digital systems.</p>

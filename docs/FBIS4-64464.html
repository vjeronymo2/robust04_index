			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["enn"-signed report: "Sale of Eko Stahl to Riva Still </F> Uncertain"]    [Text] Berlin, 2 May -- The sale of eastern Germany's  largest steel manufacturer, Eko Stahl AG in Eisenhuettenstadt,  to Italy's Riva concern is still uncertain. Originally, the  privatization was to have been carried out on 1 May (as reported  in the FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE of 30 April). On Monday [2 May],  however, representatives of Riva and functionaries from the IG  Metall union held negotiations on the conditions in line with  which the privatization would be carried out. There is still  disagreement over the appointment of an eleventh, neutral member  to the new supervisory board as well as over the way in which  personnel would be reduced. So far, no information has been  made available on the results of talks in Potsdam. The Eko  Stahl AG cannot be turned into a limited liability company until  a new supervisory board is named. This conversion is a condition  for the sale to Riva.    In January and March, the IG Metall union and Riva reached  agreement on "personnel" and "participation in decisionmaking,"  and those points must now be given concrete form. Of the 3,300  Eko employees, 1,700 are to remain after 1996. According to the  agreement with IG Metall, Riva is to provide financial support  for a reduction in personnel. However, the two parties have not  reached agreement on job guarantees, as Riva reportedly wants to  include Eko subsidiaries.    Concern boss Emilio Riva and Economics Minister Guenther  Rexrodt (Free Democratic Party) met during the weekend. During  their conversation, Riva is said to have complained about the  "hostile atmosphere" at Eisenhuettenstadt, which has meant that  problems connected with privatization there are much greater  than in the case of the Hennigsdorf steel works. Rexrodt and  the Trust Agency have repeatedly appealed to the parties  involved not to endanger privatization, because that would place  the future existence of Eisenhuettenstadt as a steelmaking  center at risk. The Trust Agency has not called into question  the sale to Riva, although the Italians have still not submitted  the consolidated balance sheet for the concern that the Trust  Agency has requested. That should in fact have been done by the  end of April.    Rexrodt said that a heavy responsibility lay with those on  company boards -- the Eko board of directors and administrative  board -- who are continuing to pursue their private or  ideological hobbyhorses. Eko will neither find another investor  nor will it receive further assistance from the EU. It is being  said that the Trust Agency has in the meantime checked whether  the Eko board of directors and supervisory board can be sacked.  However, not only the industry's right to participate in  decisionmaking, but personal contacts, too, are making it  difficult for the Trust Agency to act. The chairman of the Eko  supervisory board is Hamburg accountant Otto Gellert, who has  never made a secret of his aversion to Riva and is also deputy  chairman of the Trust Agency administrative board.</p>

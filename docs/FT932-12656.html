			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / International Company News: Intel's shares tumble on price war fears INTEL'S stock price dropped sharply yesterday, on concerns that the semiconductor manufacturer will face increasing price competition in the market for microprocessors used in personal computers. Intel currently dominates this market but yesterday Motorola, the second largest manufacturer, announced its entry into the field with the launch of its first Power PC microprocessor, developed in conjunction with IBM and Apple Computer. Motorola said that it will price the first Power PC chip at Dollars 280, for customers ordering 20,000 chips. A faster version will be priced at Dollars 374. 'Our goal is to make the PowerPC a standard in the computer industry,' said Motorola. Prices for Intel's 486 microprocessor, its leading product, range from Dollars 90 to Dollars 550, depending upon the speed and packaging of the chip. Next month, Intel is expected to price its new Pentium microprocessor at about Dollars 900. Intel's shares dropped by Dollars 5 1/4 to Dollars 87 3/8 yesterday, while Motorola lost Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 69 1/8 . Advanced Micro Devices also retreated to Dollars 29 1/4 , down Dollars 1 1/4 .</p>

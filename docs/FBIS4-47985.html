			<p>BFN     [Text] [Begin recording] [Correspondent Nan Roux] Well,  good morning from a lovely day here at Jan Smuts Airport. One  couldn't have asked for a more perfect day to welcome the  international guests to sunny South Africa. Several dignitaries  have arrived already but the man everybody was waiting for has  finally arrived, the leader of the Palestinian Liberation  Organization, Mr. Yasir 'Arafat. Mr. Yasir 'Arafat caught us  from behind -- he sneaked up from behind. Cameras were ready  and we caught him for his first address on South African soil.    ['Arafat] Good morning. I am very happy to have...to be here  this morning on this historical...[pause] events -- historical  day, and I am very happy also that I will be able to convey to  His Excellency, my brother, my friend, President Mandela, all  the greetings and good wishes from our people, from the  Palestinian people, from all his old friends and the PLO, and I  also would like to convey to his deputy, Mr. de Klerk, best  wishes and best regards.    [Roux] Mr. 'Arafat apparently organized eight of his own  cars  and own drivers to transport his delegation. Mr. 'Arafat is  definitely a highlight of the arrivals today, but several other  very interesting and very exciting dignitaries arrived, among  them Mrs. Benazir Bhutto, the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Mr.  Douglas Hurd of the United Kingdom, and the former president of  Tanzania, Mr. Julius Nyerere. We caught up with them earlier  this morning.    [Bhutto] Hello international press. How are you. I'm  supposed to say hello to you, I'm told. OK, alright. It's a  wonderful moment, not just for South Africa but for the whole  world, and I'm here on behalf of Pakistan to show that we all  join in this moment of victory, victory for mankind.    [Hurd] What can I say. It's a huge...a huge event, a huge  pleasure to be here, and to congratulate on everything that has  been achieved and to just give our support, promise our support  for what has to be achieved in the future.    [Unidentified speaker] The former president of Tanzania.    [Unidentified correspondent] Can we have a statement?    [Nyerere] Well, what statement. I'm glad to be here. I  certainly wanted to come to a free South Africa. I never  believed it was going to come in my lifetime, but here it is.  Thank you.    [Roux] Well it's definitely a very exciting day here at Jan  Smuts Airport. We are now awaiting the arrival of Mr. Fidel  Castro, from Cuba. As soon as we have him we'll bring that to  you, otherwise the next arrival is the first lady of America,  Mrs. Hillary Clinton, together with Vice President Al Gore. And  with that, back to the studio. [end recording]</p>

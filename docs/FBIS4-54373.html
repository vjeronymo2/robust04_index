			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Statement" issued by the National Army of Democratic </F> Kampuchea spokesman on 26 May; place not given -- read by  announcer]    [Text] 1. High-ranking U.S. officials have arrived in  Phnom Penh to consider military assistance to the two-headed  government.    2. This is further irrefutable proof that the United States  is interfering directly and deeply in the Cambodian issue.    The Party of Democratic Kampuchea [PDK] has repeatedly  exposed this interference, and the international community is  well aware of the fact that the Western alliance headed by the  United States has continued kindling the Hanoi Vietnamese war of  aggression in Cambodia by relying on the communist Vietnamese  forces and their Cambodian puppets. The military offensives  against Phnum Chhat, Stoung, Anlung Veng, and Pailin provide  clear proof.    They have suffered repeated defeats in this war they have  continued to kindle. Their forces are collapsing everywhere.  In view of this situation, the Western allies, particularly the  United States, have not sought an appropriate and peaceful  solution that is beneficial to all sides for the Cambodian  people [words indistinct]. They have resorted to every means to  continue the war through to the end.    3. Military assistance from the United States and Western  powers will hamper the Cambodian king's roundtable before it is  even held.    4. Despite the announcement and appeal for military aid for  the two-headed government made by Australian Foreign Minister  Gareth Evans and Winston Lord, the U.S. assistant secretary of  state for East Asia and Pacific affairs, ministers from the  ASEAN countries and other peace-loving countries in the region  and around the world have vehemently opposed such aid. They  have demanded national reconciliation and peace in Cambodia in  order to end the Cambodian problem permanently. But the United  States has stubbornly sent its high-ranking officials to Phnom  Penh to discuss the aid issue. This constitutes shameless and  arrogant contempt for the Cambodian people and the entire  international community.    The PDK, National Army of Democratic Kampuchea [NADK], and  Cambodian nation and people most vehemently condemn the United  States and Western allies providing military aid to the  two-headed government. This aid will only kindle the communist  Vietnamese war of aggression even more vigorously. The  Cambodian nation and people do not want this war. The entire  world has already said that the tragedy in Cambodia began after  the United States interfered in Cambodia's internal affairs in  1970 and the communist Vietnamese kindled the war to massacre  the Cambodian people at the end of 1978. Therefore, the United  States should stop interfering in Cambodian affairs. The  Cambodian nation and people and the NADK will continue to fight  resolutely against all of the enemy's maneuvers -- whether  military or political -- until eternal peace and national  reconciliation is achieved for the beloved motherland.    [Dated] 26 May 1994    [Signed] The NADK spokesman</p>

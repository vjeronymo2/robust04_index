Belarusian Parliament Chairman Mechyslaw Hryb did not rule  out the possibility that the request may be granted in the near  future. This will allow belarus to attend the second conference  of the Inter-parliamentary Union to be held in September as a  full member.    The announcement was made at a news conference in Minsk on  Monday. Hryb spoke about the participation of a CIS  Inter-parliamentary Assembly delegation in the first conference  of the Inter-parliamentary Union in Paris. He noted that full  membership of this organisation is very important for Belarus  from the political point of view because it will enable it to  draw the attention of the international community to its needs  and problems, including the cleaning up of the aftermath of the  Chernobyl nuclear power plant disaster.    Asked if he had discussed in Paris with Vladimir Shumeyko,  chairman of the Federation Council of Russia's Federal Assembly,  the integration of the monetary systems of the two countries,  Hryb replied in the negative. He noted that these matters are  the prerogative of the executive bodies of power -- the  governments of Russia and Belarus.    Hryb voiced concern about the present situation which has  paralysed industry and trade. "Further delays in this issue  will do no good to either side. If it cannot be done this way,  we must work out a new bilateral agreement -- a comprehensive  treaty between the two states," Hryb said.    He stressed that the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet has  already made up its mind -- it has set up a commission led by  First Deputy Parliament Chairman Vyacheslav Kuznetsov to work  out such an agreement.</p>

			<p><P> February 13, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE;  </P> <P> LABORER HIRING HALL WILL BE DISCUSSED  </P> <P> The City Council today will consider plans to open a hiring hall for day  laborers who now look for work each morning along East Chapman Avenue and  surrounding streets.  </P> <P> If approved, the center will open March 26 in a trailer at McPherson Road and  Chapman Avenue.  </P> <P> Start-up expenses for the project would total $95,000, in addition to hiring a  resource-center supervisor and a senior administrative clerk to run the hall.  </P> <P> Once the center is open, the city can begin enforcing two day-laborer  ordinances passed last September. The laws prohibit day laborers from  soliciting work on city streets and in parking lots, with maximum penalties of  a $500 fine and a six-month jail sentence.  </P> <P> The measures are intended to clear the streets of the laborers, mostly young  Latino men seeking temporary work. Matching workers with employers will be the  primary goal of the center, but city officials say they also plan to use the  hall to refer workers to other community services such as English classes.  </P> <P> Karen Nobrega, senior assistant to the city manager, said the city expects to  match 60 to 80 workers a day with employers.  </P> <P> The center is scheduled to operate from 6 a.m. to noon, Monday through Friday,  and 7 a.m. to 11 a.m. on Saturdays. In order to discourage workers from lining  up outside the office before opening, workers will participate in a lottery  drawing to determine the order in which jobs are handed out.  </P> <P> Employers can either call the center to list a job opening or can come to the  center in person. Costa Mesa and Laguna Beach have also opened hiring centers  for day laborers, and Dana Point has a telephone job bank for these workers.  SHANNON SANDS  </P></p>

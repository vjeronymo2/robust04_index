			<p><P> August 5, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEWS;  </P> <P> SOLOISTS DOMINATE FESTIVAL CONCERT  </P> <P> The Strawberry Creek Music Festival, in full swing at Pepperdine University,  offered one of conductor Yehuda Gilad's specialties Thursday night in Smothers  Theatre: a terrific early-18th-Century grab-bag program, served up by a Baroque  orchestra and featuring some dazzling solo playing.  </P> <P> Besides the Baroque Biggies, Bach, Handel and Vivaldi, there were works by  Pietro Baldassare and Jan Dismas Zelenka.  </P> <P> Gilad and forces began in polished mid-season stride with Handel's "Agrippina"  Overture. Gerard Reuter executed the solo oboe recitativo in perfect imitation  of the sensitivity and emotional eloquence of the human voice.  </P> <P> Baldassare's Sonata No. 1 in F for Cornetto, Strings and Continuo, became a  tour de force through trumpeter Anthony Plog's impeccable breath control,  refined dynamics and flawless runs.  </P> <P> Zelenka was represented by his Five Capriccios (1729). Richard Todd strove  valiantly with its daunting writing for horn, and with self-critical honesty  resisted taking a bow because he fell short of his mark.  </P> <P> Soloist Kenneth Munday's technical abandon and secure musicality made an  excellent case for Vivaldi's snappy, demanding A-minor bassoon concerto.  </P> <P> Bach's "Brandenburg" Concerto No. 1 began, as it does often, with the  challenging harmonies and syncopated horn rhythms of the opening Allegro  sounding like bobbles.  </P> <P> But thereafter, Gilad's buoyant direction, the precision and clarity of string  playing and the superbly executed sextet in the Menuetto (with Todd redeeming  himself) carried the performance on a consistently high level.

			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> WRONG IMPRESSION  </P> <P> The recent article on Cal State San Marcos ("A Different Drummer," Sept. 24)  pointed out in a generally factual manner certain "differences" to be found on  this new campus. But, as an instructor here, I am concerned that the facts  apply to matters of form more than substance, and thus, in the understandable  pursuit of novelty and humor, the article may have given an incomplete, even  incorrect, impression.  </P> <P> For example, suppose that I pioneer the "drive-up" office hour, as indeed, I  have done, with tongue in cheek. Doesn't it matter more what is said than where  it is said? The parking lot happens to be a convenient place to talk, but the  campus facilities themselves are very pleasant, perfectly adequate to the  simple needs of the present, not at all "cramped," compared to other, more  crowded, CSU campuses. What I see at San Marcos is education in its essence,  free of distractions, with learning alone providing the excitement, a great  deal of it.  </P> <P> We have only ourselves, what we read and write and say to each other, how we  help each other understand, and the human community of the mind which those  activities will form. The students are willing to take up the challenge of that  experience, and I know that I will learn from it too in ways impossible to  imagine elsewhere.  </P> <P> The term "drive-through campus" hurt my students' feelings. After all, no one  goes to any university to stay, but to change and find a better life. Many of  the students are "local," true enough, but this experience of active creation  seems to have a way of insisting on its universal import. They will certainly  be changed by it because they will be building, out of themselves and their  locality, a special gift to California. And if many of them choose to stay  nearby, all the better for them to admire what they have begun, and to  meditate, as others arrive, on the idea in Wallace Stevens' words that we "left  what still is the look of things," and that "what we said of it became a part  of what it is."  </P> <P> JAMES MACK  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

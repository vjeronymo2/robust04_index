			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Political Notebook: A practical lesson from Rab Butler Mr Chris Patten delivered a lecture last night on the contribution to Britain's political life made by the late Rab Butler. Mr Patten's close friend Mr John Major and others around the cabinet table would do well to read it. The governor of Hong Kong was careful to stress that the focus of his talk to the Coningsby Club (one of those high-Tory dining clubs) was the Conservative party's past rather than its miserable present or its uncertain future. For good measure, the former Tory chairman poured cold water on recent suggestions that he is bored by life in one of Britain's last imperial outposts. To those who have speculated recently that he would like a return to the cabinet via the House of Lords, Mr Patten replied he had 'quite enough' on his hands until June 30 1997. But politicians as clever as Mr Patten cannot complain if his audience chooses to read between the lines of his ruminations. To glance at Mr Butler's role in shaping post-war Conservatism is to appreciate just how divided and directionless his party has become. Mr Butler was the best prime minister the Tories never had. He is remembered best for the Education Act 1944, the bold legislative measure that laid the foundations for modern state schooling. But during his 26 years as a government minister Mr Butler held each of the three great offices of state - home, foreign and Treasury - as well as the chairmanship of his party. He was a superb Conservative chancellor, an adroit foreign, and a cool home secretary. As Mr Patten remarked, he was unjustly denied the party leadership in 1963 for reasons which lay buried deep in the psychiatrist's couch of the then prime minister Harold MacMillan. There was though, a more important point to last night's lecture. Mr Butler's essential contribution to Conservatism was to reconstruct from the ashes of its post-war defeat a philosophical framework. It was not driven by ideological certainties. Mr Butler believed, as Mr Patten put it, that Conservatism was not a 'collection of causes for which we are obliged to die in a ditch'. Instead it was a 'mature tradition of political thought which is neither fixed nor finished'. In the middle decades of the century that meant an approach to government which promoted incentives for enterprise and initiative without abandoning social justice or reverting to mass unemployment. Above all, though Mr Patten did not use the word, Mr Butler provided constancy: a sense that the governments he served knew how to translate principles into practical policies. Here we come to Mr Major's party. For all the prime ministerial speeches and policy initiatives of the past two years - and there have been more than most can remember - the party is drifting still without an ideological compass. The Tory right has the same difficulty in coming to terms with Britain's modest place in Europe as their counterparts in the 1950s had in recognising the end of empire. Many now look back wistfully to those glorious days of the 1980s when the party could define itself by bashing the trade unions or demanding back Britain's money from Brussels. For the 1990s and beyond, some like Mr Michael Portillo (backed forcefully yesterday by Mr Norman Lamont) are demanding that the party re-define itself in terms of Thatcherite radicalism. Others, Mr Kenneth Clarke among them, see themselves as heirs to the Butler tradition - denying the contradiction between free-market economics and social action. But even if one subtracts from the equation the corrosive battle over Europe, the overwhelming impression is of a party unable to distinguish principle from policy, practicality from expediency. Some, many, blame Mr Major for the crippling lack of consistency. Others, including many close to the prime minister, say Mr Patten's absence has deprived a lacklustre cabinet of its latter-day Rab Butler. Others say simply that the party has become ungovernable. There are ministers who believe the reality of economic recovery will allow the government to muddle through. They point out that the Labour party is stranded also in the no-man's-land between the ideological certainties of the past and the harsher truths of the present. But the odds are that in eight weeks' time Labour will elect as its leader Mr Tony Blair - a politician who, like Rab Butler, knows how to translate enduring values into modern policies. If his government is to survive Mr Major must do the same.</p>

			<p><P> May 24, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOCAL ELECTIONS BALLOT MEASURE;  </P> <P> PROP. F WOULD DOUBLE COUNCIL SALARIES, STRENGTHEN VETO  </P> <P> Vice Mayor Wallace Edgerton's advice to voters on Proposition F is simple: If  you believe that the only thing the June 5 ballot measure will accomplish is to  double City Council members' salaries, vote no.  </P> <P> Edgerton is hoping, however, that voters will see more to Proposition F than a  simple salary increase and vote yes.  </P> <P> The measure would double the salaries of Edgerton and his colleagues from  $17,739 to $35,478, costing the city an added $253,000 annually. The measure  also would strengthen the mayor's power by requiring six of the nine council  votes, instead of five, to override a veto.  </P> <P> Proponents say increasing the council's pay would open the political system to  more candidates, especially minorities, who would otherwise not be able to  afford the time commitment a council seat requires. The nine-member council has  one black councilman, Clarence Smith, and is losing its only woman, Jan Hall,  whose term expires in July.  </P> <P> "Any time you open up the system, you get better candidates because the pay is  better," Edgerton said. "And you get the incumbents rising to a better level of  performance because of increased competition."  </P> <P> Proponents also argue that council members should be compensated for the  demands and responsibilities running the city places on them.  </P> <P> Leaders of Long Beach Area Citizens Involved, which opposes the measure, said  they have no problem with the idea of increasing council salaries. They oppose  Proposition F because it does not go far enough.  </P> <P> "We favor full-time pay for full-time work," said Alan Lowenthal, president of  the group. The proposed Charter amendment is weak, he said, because it does not  forbid outside full-time employment. Most of the council members have full-time  jobs.  </P> <P> Lowenthal's group also opposes Proposition F because it will strengthen the  mayor's veto "at the expense of the council." The measure would require a  two-thirds vote of the council to override a veto.  </P> <P> Under existing law, if the council adopts an ordinance on a 5-4 vote and the  mayor vetoes it, a simple majority of five votes is required to override the  veto. But if two-thirds of the nine council votes are required to overcome a  veto, the minority on the council could determine an issue, Lowenthal pointed  out.  </P> <P> "Long Beach history shows that good legislation is frequently enacted on 5-4  votes. To obtain the sixth vote to override a veto may be difficult, if not  impossible," Lowenthal wrote in his ballot argument.  </P> <P> But supporters argue that the stronger veto would encourage the mayor to take  positions on issues and be more accountable. The existing veto power "has no  practical effect since the same number of votes that passed a measure can  override the mayor's veto power," a Charter Amendment Task Force wrote in its  final report to the council last January.  </P> <P> The task force was created to evaluate how the full-time mayoral position  voters created in 1986 is working and whether it should be revised. The task  force considered giving the mayor a vote on the council, but it opted instead  to endorse strengthening the mayor's veto power.  </P> <P> Several city officials who support Proposition F concede that the measure will  have a tough time getting voter approval, particularly since it is on the  ballot with another measure asking voters to create a new property tax to pay  for more police.  </P> <P> "It's not a particularly favorable time," said longtime Councilman Tom Clark, a  mayoral candidate.  </P></p>

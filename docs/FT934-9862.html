			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Killings and firm dollar hit bookings BOOKINGS TO Florida for next summer are running at about the same level as last year, suggesting the state is failing to maintain its share of the growing UK holiday market, travel agents said yesterday. Airtours, which owns travel chains Pickfords Travel and Hogg Robinson, said about 1.2m summer 1994 holidays to all destinations had been booked through UK agents - nearly 500,000 more than at the same time last year. Lunn Poly, the biggest chain of travel agents, said that the figure could be closer to 1.7m. Both chains said the recent murders of tourists in Florida and the strong dollar appeared to have hit bookings. Nevertheless, fears of a sharp fall in UK visitors to the state did not appear to have materialised, they said. Mr Kevin Welch, marketing director of Pickfords and Hogg Robinson, said that Spain appeared to be benefiting most from the increase in bookings. More than half of summer 1994 bookings were to Spain or the Canary Islands. He added that Greece, Cyprus, Portugal and Turkey appeared to be losing market share.</p>

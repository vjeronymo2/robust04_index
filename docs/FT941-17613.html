			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: The accent is now on enterprise - The BES's successor From today, the business expansion scheme (BES) will be replaced by the enterprise investment scheme (EIS), a switch designed to help unquoted trading companies. Investors in the new scheme will receive tax relief of only 20 per cent compared with relief at their marginal rate for BES investments. As with the BES, the investors must keep the shares for five years to secure the tax reliefs. Capital gains will be tax-free, but, unlike the BES, capital losses may be set against income tax or capital gains tax. From the tax year 1994-95, an investor will be able to get relief on total investments of Pounds 100,000 - an amount which could secure a tax refund of Pounds 20,000 (the maximum under the BES was Pounds 16,000). This level of investment would clearly represent a significant exposure to the high-risk venture capital market. An investor can take an active involvement in an EIS company through a paid directorship. But an existing entrepreneur looking for new funds would not be able to provide them through the EIS because the scheme applies only to shareholdings of less than 30 per cent. How attractive is the EIS? The risk for investors who are involved in the running of a company may be less than for those who do not. This underlines the fundamental axiom of new business ventures: that personal capital has to be put at risk. The EIS might, therefore, encourage entrepreneurs to risk their own capital, but only for new ventures and only where they limit their investment to 30 per cent. The relief against income tax or capital gains tax for a loss on the first disposal helps only in sweetening a bitter pill. For the pure investor, the EIS provides the opportunity to invest greater funds in riskier ventures, with only limited potential for the security of property backing, while getting lower tax relief. For both new and existing companies, it provides a chance to raise further equity funds; the maximum is now Pounds 1m a year. Details of the restrictions to be placed on the level of property ownership have not yet been announced. While it is reasonable to restrict the value of property, such restrictions were a major hindrance to new business ventures using the BES. Indeed, they caused some operations, such as hotels, to take an unnecessary offsetting debt burden to allow the scheme to be used. Many entrepreneurs would welcome an easing of the property restrictions to allow business decisions to be made on fundamental grounds. The EIS is likely to result in higher funding costs than the BES as investors demand high returns to compensate for higher risk and promoters' fees are increased to reflect the difficulty of attracting investors. Conclusions The EIS is welcome. It could provide much-needed equity capital and investment opportunities, but it needs greater flexibility than the BES provided for trading companies. The success of the BES was very much limited to the private rented housing sector. The chancellor of the exchequer may be optimistic in his estimates of the sums which could be raised - nearly Pounds 500m before April 1997 - particularly if the new rules bar many of the features of BES issues, such as being able to provide a form of assured exit. As the EIS will be restricted to trading companies, it would be more attractive if investors could borrow, with full risk recourse, to fund their investments (this was outlawed for BES issues) and were able to receive their dividends in a tax-free form. It would be nice to see the EIS providing the seed for tomorrow's larger companies rather than restricting horizons.

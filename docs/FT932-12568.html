			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Seconds out - Timex heads towards final countdown: Both sides of the industrial dispute today put their case to the Commons employment committee THE SACKING of the Timex workers has aroused anger in the ranks of organised labour and raises a number of issues about British industrial relations of interest far beyond the small circuit board production plant in Dundee. Local union officials fear it could herald a new, more aggressive phase of the rolling back of union power after 14 years of demoralising retreat. To the strikers and many others in highly unionised Dundee the dispute is a fight for justice. The strikers are mainly women, many with more than 30 years' service. Mr Jimmy Airlie, the AEEU union's executive officer for Scotland, said: 'Nowhere else in Europe are decent women and men being sacked for taking legitimate and legal industrial action.' The company sees the dispute differently. Mr Peter Hall, Timex's chief executive, said the decision was not taken lightly. The company feared the union would take industrial tribunal action alleging unfair dismissal if the company fired only strikers. He said the loss-making Dundee plant faced the threat of closure because of the commercial pressures of producing components under contract, and a more assertive managerial style was required. The US-registered multinational - now owned by the Norwegian entrepreneur Mr Fred Olsen - was set up in Dundee in 1946 and for 37 years made components for the watch industry before switching to circuit boards. One of the city's biggest employers, it established good and close relations with the unions. In 1990 Timex and the AEEU's forebear signed an innovatory agreement. In return for profit sharing and share ownership, a generous savings plan, cash lump sums and a worker seat on the board, the union agreed to radical changes in working practices, with quality circles, teamwork and flexibility. Mr John Dryfe, US vice-president who worked at the plant for many years, says the workers failed to deliver. They disagree. They claim Mr Hall's arrival as chief executive in June 1991 led to a deterioration in relations. Mr John Kydd, the former chief convener, said: 'I don't believe he has worked in an industrial relations environment before.' Mr Hall denies being anti-union. He said he worked well with the union leadership until Mr Kydd was elected on December 7 last year. Within days both sides were on a collision course. As a result of falling demand, Mr Hall decided to lay off half the workers for the first half of this year. The union suggested all workers be laid off in rotation. Mr Hall thought this impractical. Early in January he laid off 120. On January 15 the union balloted workers on strike action. They backed the call by 92 per cent to 8 per cent and walked out 14 days later. Mr Hall warned the strikers they would be dismissed if they did not come back. By this stage the company was looking at other ways to cut costs, including a wage freeze and reductions in the value of pension and other benefits. Mr Hall assured the strikers that was a 'separate' matter - a return to work did not depend on the workers accepting new conditions. The parent company, Timex Electronics, took a more direct role in the dispute and Mr Dryfe flew in from the US. After 13 hours of talks on February 10 and 11, he and Mr Hall believed they had a deal with local negotiators. Mr Hall agrees the lay-off and cuts were linked by then. Under the four-point peace plan Timex accepted rotation of lay-offs for half the workforce subject to independent conciliation. The company also wanted a wage freeze and a 10 per cent cut in benefits. In return, the workers were promised half the profits made. The union officials deny they accepted the peace plan. Mr Kydd's father, the union's divisional organiser, said he was 'incensed' at the 'unprincipled' decision to widen the bargaining agenda. After taking legal advice the union recommended rejecting the plan, but that members return to work 'under protest'. Mr Hall insisted on acceptance of the plan and refused to let the workers into the plant. On February 17 the workers again turned the plan down by a show of hands. On the same day all the workers, including the 17 who worked through the strike, received dismissal notices. As far as Mr Hall is concerned that was the end of the strike and he started to recruit the substitute labour force. Since then attitudes have hardened. Timex has become a cause celebre in Scotland. Militants have flooded to the factory gates in support of the pickets. The round-the-clock picket line, complete with burning brazier, has none of the menace often associated with picket lines. Sacked Timex women drink tea and puff cigarettes - many of the workers who have replaced them are tough-looking men who wear balaclavas to hide their identity. The union has played the dispute cannily, using expert legal advice, frustrating efforts by Timex to persuade local judges to prevent demonstrations and marches outside the plant. From May 17, 90 days after the dismissals, the company will have the right to rehire ex-employees selectively without facing unfair dismissal charges from the rest. 'We will consider the position then,' Mr Hall said. The company will need a further 260 workers this summer to meet an upturn in demand. In the US, Mr Dryfe sounds more conciliatory, wanting a Japanese-style agreement to boost productivity with an end to restrictive practices and demarcation lines. Union officials said: 'We just want a negotiated settlement.'</p>

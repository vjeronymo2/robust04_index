			<p>931106 FT  06 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Cost-saving idea for chancellor Sir, I would like to suggest a cost-reduction programme for the chancellor, that would save (or release) considerable resources from current consumption without removing the reasons for using those resources in the first place. Abolish current road tax, transfer tax cost to fuel prices. Substitute the old tax disc for an MOT disc, issued by garages, and display the MOT disc on windscreens. This would save paper, police and magistrates' time, post office counter staff time and much else. The government would not lose revenue and millions of man hours could be reallocated to more important tasks. S McIlroy, The Wapping Big Lobster Co, F16 Lanterns Court, Millharbour, London E14</p>

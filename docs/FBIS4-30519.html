			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Keynote Speech by Chief Delegate of North Side at </F> Preliminary Contact for North-South Top-Level Talks" -- KCNA  headline]    [Text] Panmunjom, June 28 (KCNA) -- Kim Yong-sun, chairman  of the Reunification Policy Committee of the Supreme People's  Assembly and chief delegate of the North side, made a keynote  speech at the preliminary contact for the North-South top-level  talks currently under way in the southern portion of Panmunjom.    Noting that the reality facing the Korean nation now with  one  year to go before the 50th year of national division is grim, he  expressed the belief that the holding of the North-South  top-level talks would mark an important historical occasion in  setting right the orientation of our nation.    He said:    The North-South top-level talks concern the prestige of the  top-level authorities of both sides and the destiny of the  nation and worldwide concern is focussed on the talks.    The North-South top-level talks must be successful talks on  all accounts to promote national reconciliation and unity and  give all the fellow countrymen bright hopes of peace and  independent and peaceful reunification of the country.    It is our consistent stand to open a dramatic phase for  achieving national reunification through top-level talks without  any outside interference.    As your side knows, respected President Kim Il-song  personally initiated top-level talks already when the  North-South dialogue began in May 1972 and has made particular  efforts to arrange meaningful top-level talks for the  reunification of the country.    Our proposal in May last year for the exchange of special  envoys was also part of the efforts for top-level talks.    But these efforts failed to bear a proper fruit.    It is, indeed, very lucky that the top-level talks which  have  failed to be realized for the past decades are going to see the  light now, 50 years after division. Underlying this, I think,  is the common stand of us concerned over the present and future  of the nation.    We would like to believe that this stand is, indeed, a  manifestation of the spirit of independence for shaping the  destiny of our nation by the efforts of Koreans themselves.    We can say a success of the top-level talks is guaranteed,  if  the North and the South do not differ in this spirit of national  independence. For, lying in this are the supreme idea that  links the North and the South by one bond, the source of the  nation's will and strength capable of shaping our destiny by  ourselves, and a sure guarantee for defending the common  interests of the nation without playing into the hands of  outside forces that make scapegoats out of the interests of our  nation.    If both sides proceed from this spirit of independence and  national stand, the North and the South can get reconciled to  and unite with each other, transcending all difference in  conformity with the principles of independence, peaceful  reunification and great national unity, break the deadlock by  the united efforts of the nation itself and climb a peak of  reunification and prosperity as desired by all the fellow  countrymen.    The North-South top-level talks we are going to arrange will  mean creating a great new history of the nation, an undertaking  for turning the history of antagonism which has lasted for half  a century in our country into a history of great national unity,  and the history of confrontation into a history of peace, and  the history of division into a history of reunification.    It will no doubt bring to our 70 million fellow countrymen  bright hopes of reunification in the 1990s and restore the high  pride of our nation with a fine history, tradition and  resourcefulness.    It will also give great joy to the peaceloving people of the  world who are concerned over the situation on the Korean  peninsula.    This is our basic view of the forthcoming North-South  top-level talks. Stressing the heavy responsibility of both  sides in successfully preparing the historical North-South  top-level talks, I would like to put forward our proposal  concerning the basic matters that should be discussed at the  current preliminary contact.    First, the venue of the top-level talks.    We propose that Pyongyang be designated as the venue of the  top-level talks.    As your side also knows, respected President Kim Il-song  already invited "President" Kim Yong-sam to visit Pyongyang when  the latter active in an opposition party and "President" Kim  Yong-sam has repeatedly expressed his willingness to meet  President Kim Il-song at any place and visit Pyongyang.    We believe the designation of Pyongyang as the venue of the  talks accords with this will of the top level of both sides.    Second, the date of the top-level talks.    We propose that the talks be held in mid-August.    We think it is a significant time because it is around the  liberation day of August 15 both the North and the South  celebrate.    Third, working procedures for the top-level talks.    Various working procedures must be discussed for the  top-level talks.    We think it reasonable to discuss the working matters except  such important ones as the venue and date of the talks at a  contact of delegates -- a delegate and two support personnel  from each side -- immediately after today's contact.    The contact of delegates may begin on July 1 and discuss  the composition and size of the delegation, the schedule of  stay, the dispatch of an advance team, the procedures of travel,  offer of conveniences, guarantee of personal safety and other  matters of working procedures.    Fourth, the creation of an atmosphere for the top-level  talks.    We think it important for both sides to create a good  atmosphere, if the talks between the top-level authorities of  the North and the South are to be arranged with success.  Therefore, we propose that both sides stop any act that may mar  the atmosphere of the top-level talks from July 1.    This us our side's proposal concerning the opening of the  North-South top-level talks. We suggest that an agreement of  the preliminary contact for the North-South top-level talks  containing this idea be adopted and published today.</p>

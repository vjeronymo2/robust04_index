			<p>Language: <F P=105> Kazakh </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Dawitali Stambekuly: "The Testing Area Has Been </F> Closed but the Danger Is Still Present."]    [Text] Between 13 and 17 September there took place in the  region of the Semey Testing Area, more specifically, in  Kurchatov city that for so many years remained off the map of  the republic and was surrounded by secret weapons, a scientific  and technical conference on the theme: "Plans for the  Development of Nuclear Energy in the Republic of Kazakhstan and  Its Reliability and Safety." Participating in the conference and  exchanging views were nuclear energy specialists from the United  States, Canada, Japan, Russian, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine. The  primary purpose of the conference was to draw up directions for  the development of nuclear energy in our country under the  leadership of the Republic National Nuclear Center. What does  that mean? This means that the former testing area, the  equipment and reactors used for tests there, will be used for  peaceful purposes, that is to supply energy to industry and the  economy. However, there will be nothing easy about this. This  is something which will be resolved only after a lot of  discussion. In particular, there is concern about future safety.  Thus, our reporter shares with us some of his thoughts arising  from the conference regarding these issues.    It cannot be hidden that, towards the end of the 20th  century  shortage of energy supplies in all corners of the world are  cooling the people's economy. It is clear that this crisis is  giving our country something to think about, along with the  other Soviet republics which have now achieved their  independence.    This conference taking place in our Republic also discussed  plans drawn up for the future of energy in our country. Energy,  in Kazakh terms, light and heat, are certainly sources of life.  At present it is possible for any thinking citizen of our  sovereign country not to think about energy? However, if we are  not to depend on others for the sources of life, are there  possibilities for us to create them ourselves?    Do we need nuclear power plants or do we not need them? We  need them. If we can develop them in a way not dangerous to our  lives what is wrong with that?    There is a throbbing which has remained behind in the hearts  of our people. It is the accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power  Plant. No one has yet forgotten it. They cannot forget it. This  being the case, the most important question is the safety of  human life. What must we do to achieve this. On this account the  question must be posed more broadly and more directly. We must  provide a complete and thorough ecological evaluation of the  damage to the environment and to the people due to explosions  and tests in Kazakhstan, and, likewise, in all of the nuclear  testing areas of the world. Likewise, we must broadly research  the effects of a nuclear power station on the environment and on  the people.    Together with this, the questions of protection in social  and  economic terms of those harmed by explosions in the former  testing area, of assisting the people in ecological, biomedical  and psychological terms, of regulating from a legal and  political standpoint the resolution of very critical  environmental questions, of creating a mechanism for economic  security, must assume primary priority. In order to accomplish  this, we must form an authoritative international commission.  Without this an uneasy people will make known its alarm at the  damage, aside from the benefits of a nuclear power station.    According to what was said at the conference by the  scientist-specialists, a nuclear power station built according  to the work plans of the National Nuclear Center is not  something that can be completed in the near future. It seems  that it would take 10-15 years. However, looking very critically  at preparatory work going on now is something which will be a  guaranty of the life of the people. This being the case, we must  not keep the work which has begun out of sight of the people.    Indeed, I am not against the objectives for the development  of the people's industry and enterprise. However, we must not  forget that nuclear power specialists are subordinates, and we  must remember that a great deal of secrecy is associated with  their work.    There is another major question which must be discussed  here.  That is the danger that Kazakhstan will remain a repository for  radioactive wastes. This is a problem for Semey Oblast in  particular. There is no doubt that the former testing area has  been closed. However, there are still radioactive wastes left  behind by the explosions. We must not forget that they will  still present a problem after our time has passed.    Burial of these radioactive wastes has now become a major  issue. Ghadilet Andianuly, director of our Republic's National  Nuclear Center, in answer to my question, said: "It is right  that you should be alarmed about this. However, we cannot take  things which came to life here and bury them in other places.  Countries will not receive the radioactive wastes of others.  Bearing this in mind, we must look for the right way, make  wastes safe and bury them on our own lands. Major measures will  be needed to achieve this. However, at present we cannot say  where we will bury these wastes. State permission and a decision  will be necessary for this. At the same time, the views of local  people will be heard.    On the other hand, the talk of building a nuclear power  plant  is something different. It must take place when our Republic is  suffering economic difficulty. Its importance is very great for  removing industry and the economy from crisis. A safe nuclear  power station could have a major influence upon a clean  environment. The reason is that many thermo-electrical power  stations in our republic produce massive amounts of dust, smoke,  and cinders. If we take into consideration that on top of this,  16 billion tons of wastes from the production and processing of  valuable resources are collected in the storage areas of  industrial establishments. All is nothing but poisons. Thus, to  be free of this a safe electrical station is needed."    We listened to the speech of Professor Yoshi Fujie, chief of  laboratory research for nuclear reactors of the Tokyo Technology  Institute. According to what Yoshi Fujie said regarding the  safety of nuclear reactors for humans, there is no nation ahead  of Japan in this area. For example, while the accident at  Chernobyl shocked the world, there have also been accidents in  the United States, Britain, and France. However, there has not,  up to the present, been a single accident in Japan, which in one  of the smallest territories in the world has the largest number  of nuclear energy reactors, 42. It appears that the first  nuclear power plant was opened [in Japan] during the second half  of the year 1950. In the future the number of nuclear power  plants in Japan will reach 55. We thought that we must take our  example from a country which has so successfully dealt with the  atom.    One interesting thing, is that the dangers of a nuclear  power  plant do not frighten the Japanese. The professor proved this  completely. The reason is that the Japanese seem confidant of  the knowledge of their nuclear specialists and scientists. When  we think about this, it becomes apparent that we also need  scientists and specialists with profound knowledge, who have  been produced by our people. Whatever we say, we know our own  souls. This is the reason why we look with less confidence on  others who come to take advantage of us.    In this connection we must speak of the educational  establishments which are to be opened by the Kazakhstan National  Nuclear Center. They will prepare future atomic scientists and  specialists of our own nationality.    As for specialist cadres, Fedor Fedorovich Safanov, deputy  chief scientist for the Semey Testing Area, USSR state prize  laureate, mentioned, in this connection, that many scientists of  the former testing area had gone to Russia. When I asked: "what  will you do now?", the major-general replied: "I will remain in  Kazakhstan. I will become one of the scientist-specialists of  the nuclear power plant."    This person drew attention to the involvement of the  National  Nuclear Center with the area's environment, to questions such as  turning over the task of investigating the testing area and  quickly cleaning up the radioactive wastes there, and to  overcoming the danger when the subterranean riches of the area  are recovered. In any case these are proper concerns. We will  have to investigate each of them individually in the future. The  investigation should begin now.    Nuclear energy should inspire not a little fear in human  beings. In support of this we may mention the accidents at  nuclear power plants in the United States, Britain, and Ukraine.  According to official information, nuclear production appears to  have polluted the surface of the earth at a level of 6 million  curies.    Two and a half thousand of the 60,000 nuclear weapons made  during the age of nuclear testing have been exploded for test  purposes. More specifically, it is no secret that almost 1,000  have been exploded in the United States, and more than 500 in  the former Soviet Union, most of them in Kazakhstan. Each  explosion has done irreparable damage to the environment, and to  the people living in the testing area. Since the closure of the  Semey testing area, efforts to overcome and clear up the damage  have gone forward very slowly. The ones responsible have not had  to explain their guilt before the people.    Let us take a quick look at one fact. The United States has  spent a total of 10 trillion dollars on all types of arms since  the Second World War. At present, however, up to 200 million  dollars are appropriated each year to clean up the environment.  With us there is no money at all for such work.    To tell the truth, in our country the ecological rights of  people are not protected. Due to little oversight, the sources  of nuclear power and the nuclear industry are continuing to  increase pollution by radioactivity. First and foremost, the  ecological rights of citizens must be protected at the state  level by a special law.    "Make no mistake about it. What we are doing is discussing  now the future of nuclear energy." So said V. Vasilenko,  chairman of the Council of Experts for Social Ecology of the  "Nevada-Semey" International Antinuclear Movement. We are on no  easy path. As we have said, local people must still bear in mind  one frightening thing. This is the fact that things have not  been collected from test sites in the testing area. It seems  that presently the livestock of the people are being pastured in  these areas. It has been claimed that testing area authorities  have been forced, because of a lack of funding due to market  pressures, to leave the area unguarded or otherwise unsecured,  and that they have no choice but to sit on their hands. But does  it have to be like this? On 29 August, 1991, our hair stood on  end when we realized that there was still the danger of an  explosion prior to Republic of Kazakhstan President Nazarbayev  issuing an official edict to close the Semey Testing Area. Since  the Russian and Kazakhstan governments did not quickly made a  decision about this, the situation remained very difficult. The  local people were very alarmed at this. In fact, the testing  area has been closed, but we cannot free ourselves from the  danger. This being the case, we are thinking of building a  nuclear power plant in the 21st century. This will prove a  correct decision. However, when a nuclear power plant remains  incomplete, how can we clean up the mess in the testing area?  The thought disturbs us that with one labor remaining incomplete  and still dangerous, how can we begin a second, new effort?</p>

			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Northamber cuts first half deficit to Pounds 54,000 Reduced pre-tax losses of Pounds 54,000 were announced by Northamber, the supplier of computer hardware and software, for the half year to October 31. Losses last time were Pounds 495,000 restated. Mr David Phillips, chairman, said the result reflected the benefit of the closure of Studley in Ireland, which lost Pounds 258,000 in the first half last year and more than Pounds 1m in the full year. On trading he said that competition continued to intensify and gross margins declined again in the period. It was clear, he stated, that the 1993-94 year could be another difficult year for the sector. Turnover improved to Pounds 45.7m compared with Pounds 45.3m which included Pounds 3.05m from discontinued operations. Losses per share were 0.3p (2.2p).</p>

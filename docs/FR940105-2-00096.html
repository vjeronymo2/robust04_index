(the licensee) to withdraw its December 2, 1988 application for proposed amendment to Facility Operating License DPR&hyph;21 for the Millstone Nuclear Power Station, Unit 1, located at the licensee's site in New London County, Connecticut. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed amendment would have revised the Technical Specifications to reflect the implementation of modifications during the 1989 refueling outage related to degraded grid undervoltage detection. Since the licensee plans to make additional modifications to the undervoltage detection circuitry during the Cycle 15 refueling outage, additional Technical Specification changes will be necessary and will be submitted prior to the outage. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission has previously issued a Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on February 1, 1989 (54 FR 5170). However, by letter dated September 10, 1993, the licensee withdrew the proposed change. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For further details with respect to this action, see the application for amendment dated December 2, 1988, and the licensee's later dated September 10, 1993, which withdrew the application for license amendment. The above documents are available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, The Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the local public document room located at the Learning Resources Center, Three Rivers Community-Technical College, Thames Valley Campus, 574 New London Turnpike, Norwich, Connecticut 06360. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 28th day of December 1993. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> James W.

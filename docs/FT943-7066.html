			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / US fund irked by Body Shop reaction The US ethical investment fund that sold its shares in Body Shop International has criticised the cosmetics and toiletries group for the way in which the fund's views have been represented. Franklin Research and Development, the Boston-based organisation, said yesterday that - contrary to Body Shop's assertions - its concerns about the company's green and ethical image were among the reasons for its decision to sell. News of Franklin's decision to dispose of 50,000 Body Shop shares and to recommend its clients to do likewise has triggered an intense debate. It has also prompted Body Shop to claim that Franklin had said its views had been misrepresented in the press. However, Mr Patrick McVeigh, Franklin's senior vice president, said yesterday his organisation had been put under pressure by Body Shop, and was 'not pleased' by the way its views had been characterised. His comments follow suggestions that Franklin decided to sell its shares purely on commercial grounds: because of competition and the potential impact of allegations - expected to be published in the US press - on the share price. 'We certainly had ethical concerns, if not we would not have sold the stock,' he said. 'We do not sell stock based on every short-term rumour.' One article is expected in Business Ethics magazine next week. Franklin is also in discussions with Body Shop over an article in its own newsletter and over any revised recommendation - it is still advising clients to sell. Mr McVeigh said Body Shop's behaviour towards Franklin 'could not help but influence' its final assessment of the company. Body Shop yesterday confirmed it had held discussions with the US Federal Trade Commission, which is investigating disputes with franchisees. It had received one request for information from the FTC nine months ago with which it had co-operated fully. 'Any federal agency in the US upon receiving a complaint - whatever the source - is forced to investigate.' Many franchisees were asking for more shops. 'This is hardly a system in disarray.' Mr Gordon Roddick, chairman, expressed frustration at 'innuendo' from 'the zealots of cynicism'.</p>

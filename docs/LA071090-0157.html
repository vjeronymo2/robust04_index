			<p><P> July 10, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOUDON'S LOOKING FOR HIT, BUT WILL HELMS DANCE TO IT?  </P> <P> Sen. Jesse Helms probably doesn't appreciate it, but he has something in common  with a dead skunk -- both are featured in the works of a North Carolina  songwriter.  </P> <P> The Charlotte Observer reported today that Helms (R-N.C.) is featured in the  offbeat lyrics of songwriter Loudon Wainwright III, whose recording "Jesse  Don't Like It" is scheduled for release July 23.  </P> <P> Wainwright, who hails from Durham, N.C., hasn't had a hit since 1973, when his  song "Dead Skunk," about a dead skunk in the middle of a road, made the Top 20  charts.  </P> <P> "Jesse Don't Like It" rails against Helms for his conservatism, especially his  opposition to the use of taxpayer-supported National Endowment for the Arts  funds for what the senator considers obscene works. The song goes:  </P> <P>  If Jesse says it's dirty, it don't get any funds.  </P> <P>  They use that taxpayers' money on tobacco and guns.  </P> <P>  And your freedom of expression is being denied.  </P> <P>  But if you're not sure what you like, just let Jesse decide.  </P> <P>  Helms could not be reached for comment, and his campaign spokeswoman, Beth  Burris, said she has not yet heard the record.  </P></p>

			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / Bosnian Serbs wary of move to state of war With artillery fire occasionally audible in the distance, representatives of the Bosnian Serbs have gathered in Pale, above Sarajevo, to consider how much freedom of action to give their leader, Mr Radovan Karadzic. Yesterday, after two days of debate behind firmly closed doors, it was clear that the Bosnian Serb 'parliament' would stop well short of declaring a state of war throughout its territory in Bosnia. Mr Karadzic - facing mixed fortunes on the battlefield, a boycott by his former protectors in Belgrade, and isolation from the wider world - would like carte blanche to wage all-out war. But fearing a dilution of its authority, the makeshift assembly has forced him to limit the scope of any declaration of emergency rule to those areas most immediately at risk from the latest fighting. Officials say the formal state of war will apply only to some 50 per cent of Serb-controlled territory. 'Of course, you can always expect resistance,' said an official close to the Pale leadership. 'People got scared by all this talk of declaring war. But we have to prove to the Moslems that they cannot win.' Mr Karadzic said before yesterday's debate that he would assume certain powers from the assembly but insisted there was no question of it being dissolved. The parliament has often been dismissed as a rubber stamp for the Bosnian Serb leadership, but it does represent Mr Karadzic's link with a population, part of which is not always necessarily behind him. He cannot afford to be seen ignoring the interests of the representatives. Officials admit that absenteeism and black marketeering, sometimes across enemy lines, have resulted in military weakness. The new measures will include more efficient mobilisation (which has already begun), restrictions on civilian movement and introduction of martial law. Local government will be concentrated in small groups of officials, directly answerable to Mr Karadzic. 'It will not be a classic state of war, but a semi-state of war,' said Mr Aleksa Buha, the 'foreign minister'. 'This is a very serious decision. We don't want to do it too fast.' Punishments for desertion and dereliction of duty are likely to be toughened. On Wednesday, Mr Karadzic said several brigade commanders responsible for losing territory near the north-western enclave of Bihac had already been replaced for disobeying orders. Since Serbia severed relations with the Bosnian Serbs in August, Mr Karadzic has conducted periodic purges of the army and police, aimed at rooting out those who might not think twice about taking their orders from Belgrade. An official in Pale said the dismissals were 'a normal consequence' of the breakdown in relations. But it is clear that the Bosnian Serb leader's personal feud with President Slobodan Milosevic has led him, rightly or wrongly, to suspect those around him. Reuter adds from Zagreb: Croatia hinted yesterday that it might attack rebel Krajina Serbs if they keep firing from Croatia across the border at Moslems in Bosnia. Krajina Serb artillery has been hammering government positions in Moslem-populated Bihac since Tuesday and a Krajina Serb jet launched two missiles into Bihac town yesterday. 'We believe Croatia will do something if this continues,' said Mr Gojko Susak, defence minister.</p>

			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / International Company News: New funding source for Leeds Permanent Leeds Permanent Building Society, the UK's fifth largest, has raised Pounds 100m (Dollars 151m) for new mortgage lending through a mortgage-backed loan facility, the first of its kind for a UK building society. The transaction, which gives Leeds increased access to wholesale funding and opens up a new source of funding for other building societies, is a form of securitisation. This financing technique is widely used in the US but is still at an early stage in its development in the UK. Securitisation allows lenders to take loans off their balance sheet, thereby removing the risk of default and freeing capital. The assets are placed in a special-purpose vehicle which then raises money by selling debt securities to investors. Interest on the so-called 'mortgage-backed' securities is funded by the loan repayments. However, instead of selling securities in the public market, Leeds has used a pool of mortgages to provide security for a loan from a group of banks. The deal, signed on Friday, is a test run for a system which Leeds has set up to securitise its mortgages. Citibank, Commerzbank, Daiwa, NatWest, Rabobank, Royal Bank of Scotland and Union Bank of Switzerland each took Pounds 13.57m of senior notes. Daiwa and UBS took Pounds 2.5m each of the Pounds 5m subordinated portion.</p>

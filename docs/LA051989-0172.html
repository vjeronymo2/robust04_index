BRIEFING;  </P> <P> LOCKERBIE PLANS U.S.-STYLE PARTY  </P> <P> Pan Am, whose Flight 103 was bombed over Lockerbie on Dec. 21, is throwing a  party to make up for the Christmas cheer the town missed because of the  disaster that killed all 259 aboard the New York-bound jet and 11 on the  ground, an organizer said today.  </P> <P> Community spokesman Alex McElroy said the idea came from New Jersey schoolboy  Ed Blaus, who will be attending the American-style barbecue June 3 with his  parents and three brothers.  </P> <P> Others expected at the party are Disney characters Mickey and Minnie Mouse,  folk and rock bands, a football coach and a bagpipe player.  </P> <P> "Ed's Party," as the event is being called, will be held on Lockerbie's soccer  ground and 6,500 people from the southern Scottish town and surrounding  district are invited, McElroy said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 12, 1989, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> SNOW HELPS DEPUTIES TRACK LOOT  </P> <P> Last week's blanket of white may have hindered Southern California motorists  but it was a big help to Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies in the Antelope  Valley, who followed tracks in the snow to members of an alleged burglary ring.  </P> <P> Deputies Don Self and Fred McNutt, who were responding Friday to a report of a  burglary near 12th Street East and Avenue Q in Lancaster, discovered footprints  leading away from the area.  </P> <P> If that wasn't enough to make them curious, the square imprint of a television  set that appeared every so often certainly did.  </P> <P> Self and McNutt followed the tracks for several blocks to an apartment building  in the 32000 block of 12th Street, Sgt. Ernie Roop said. They obtained search  warrants for several of the building's apartments and discovered a cache of  stolen goods that included car stereos, guns and several television sets. The  investigators also seized a small amount of rock cocaine.  </P> <P> Five people who lived in several of the apartments were booked on suspicion of  narcotics possession, receiving stolen property and burglary, Roop said. The  names of the suspects were not released.  </P> <P> Roop said the items are believed to have been taken in at least 20 burglaries  in the Lancaster area.  </P></p>

			<p>920805 FT  05 AUG 92 / Arts: Vadstena - Summer Festivals VADSTENA IS a tiny town on the eastern shore of Lake Vattern in the middle of southern Sweden. It is historically rich - St Bridget lived and died there (her relics are in the cathedral), and the magnificent castle built by Gustav Vasa in the 16th century houses some of the country's most important archives. It is unspoilt, peaceful, ravishingly beautiful. Since a room in Vasa's castle was the scene of some of the earliest opera performances ever put on in Sweden, the town's connections with the medium are historically intriguing. But recently, they have been revived with peculiar and notable success: the International Vadstena Academy, founded in 1964 by Ingrid Maria Rappe, the singing teacher, has developed an international reputation as one of the most valuable of all summer-school forcing-grounds for young operatic talent. The roll-call of Swedish singers who have passed through on the way to wider fame is itself an impressive testimonial (Britt-Marie Aruhn, Helena Dose, Marianne Haggander, Anita Soldh, Anne Sofie von Otter, Thomas Sunnegardh, Thomas Lander, Hillevi Martinpelto etc.). The producer Goran Jarvefelt took early steps here; Arnold Ostman, Sweden's leading 'period' practitioner, served as artistic director from 1969 to 1982. The Academy is a finishing school (lessons and master-classes forming the backbone of the pedagogical schedule) but by no means just that: as the programme book proudly proclaims, it was set up 'for the purpose of studying and performing both newly composed music dramas and early operas'. Most years there is a world premiere; every year there is a rarity from the byways of the Baroque, Classical or Romantic repertory, researched with care and often edited 'in house'. The mixture of new and old, theory and practice, past and present is obviously an unending source of stimulus. Standards are remarkably high. Seeing that Rodney Milnes and Paul Driver have previously proclaimed on this page the virtues and pleasures of the Vadstena experience, I must not build up my visit there last weekend into a feat of uncharted exploration, or pretend that the excellence of the single performance I encountered came without warning. This year's schedule consists of a revival of last year's Vadstena premiere, Thine is the Kingdom by Jonas Forsell, and two Tempest operas (both given in Swedish translation) - Prospero's Dream, a new pasticcio using extant numbers by Purcell, and Die Geisterinsel, J. F. Reichardt's Singspiel of 1798. I saw the Reichardt, and confidently count it one of the most arresting evenings on my 1992 operatic calendar. As a re-discovery it was revelatory (not least because in the standard textbooks Die Geisterinsel is treated to the most cursory dismissal); as a production played by a student orchestra and sung by several first-timers on stage it was astonishing - physically free and agile, joyfully fresh and imaginative, with a spirit-lifting sense of dramatic and musical wonder. Gotter's libretto for Die Geisterinsel was admired by Goethe (who had earlier collaborated with Reichardt on Claudine von Villa Bella) but reputedly turned down by Mozart. Shakespeare is only a base; the narrative, which includes non-singing parts for Sycorax and the spirit Maja, is at once simplified and enriched with the supernatural. Reichardt's three acts provides a vital missing link between The Magic Flute and the Romantic energies and excitements of Cherubini, Beethoven, Schubert and Weber. For a while it is the similarities, influences, period traits that hold the attention; then the sturdy individuality of Reichardt's stagecraft makes its mark. Up to now Reichardt's name has cropped up as a composer of Lieder; his ability to drop delightful song-phrases of folk-like innocence into long, grandly constructed act-finales (very well sustained by the conductor B. Tommy Andersson) was therefore no surprise. In a room entirely without stage platform or machinery, Asa Melldahl's staging had of necessity to create magic through the simplest of devices - smoke, lights, comic tricks of burlesque linege (and sometimes hilarious vulgarity: Caliban, a flasher in a dirty mac, had us all in fits). The flavour of Peter Pan that she had infused into the text drew a charm out of the piece that chimed ideally well with the capacities of the young cast. Among them I predict a particularly bright future for the smooth, wide-ranging bass-baritone Lars Arvidsson (Caliban), the sweet yet glittering lyric soprano Karin Ingeback (Miranda), the personable and hugely promising tenor Staffan Galli (Fernando), and the two high sopranos Kristin Aabel (Ariel on a bicycle) and Annika Hassel (Fabio, Fernando's page). Spoken dialogue was here no trial-by-recitation, as young English performers too often allow it to be. The fluency of the performance made the three acts and three hours whizz by. Sweden's most famous summer festival, at the Drottningholm Court Theatre outside Stockholm, has reached a turning-point. Arnold Ostman's decade as director has just ended; next year Elisabeth Soderstrom takes over. Rumours of change - notably the non-renewal of the 'period' instrumentalists' contracts - are already flying about. Meanwhile, Ostman's final show in this most glorious and perfectly preserved of 18th century theatres was a typical piece of adventurousness: Gluck's Orfeo in its 1769 Parma edition, never before revived. The crucial point about this version is that, whereas the hero of 1762 original was an alto castrato, and that of the 1774 Paris re-working a tenor, Gluck's Parma Orpheus was a soprano castrato. Moved up to soprano pitch, his great, grief-stricken outpourings take on an entirely different character - they convey a new vulnerability, are charged with a new intensity. The performance itself, weakly cast, brainlessly staged (with unwanted set-changes added to almost every scene) and conducted by Ostman in rather fancy, soft-grained fashion, was disappointing. But the value of the re-discovery has nevertheless been proved beyond argument.</p>

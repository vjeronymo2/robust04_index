			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Ivan Novikov] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 11 TASS -- Judges of the Russian  Constitutional Court will remain in office for a term of 12  years. This is one of the key provisions of a draft law on the  Constitutional Court which was adopted in the first reading by  the State Duma on Wednesday.    The decision on the 12-year term in office was adopted  following long debates. The accord was finally reached today as  lawmakers voted for the resolution.    Another problem which caused unequivocal reaction from  lawmakers was a provision suggesting that the president may  offer candidatures to the post of judges of the Constitutional  Court. Accord on this problem has been finally reached as well.    The draft bill on the Constitutional Court adopted in the  first reading today is based on provisions of the existing  Russian Constitution which were developed and made more concrete.    The Constitutional Court is the organ of state control,  independently exercising judicial power by means of  Constitutional Court proceedings. The main principles of the  Constitutional Court are independence, collective approach,  glasnost, competitiveness and equality of the parties concerned.  The Constitutional Court consists of 19 judges appointed by the  Federation Council on the recommendation by the president.    The State Duma has instructed the Committee for Legislation  and Judicial Reform to finalize the draft until June 1, 1994 and  submit it to the Duma for final approval.</p>

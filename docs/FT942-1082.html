			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Sport (World Cup '94): Cypriot TV an ad-free zone - Soccer Advertisers in Cyprus have withdrawn TV commercials aired during World Cup games after protests by fans. State-run Cyprus Television said it had received hundreds of calls from viewers complaining that ads aired while the games were on were too distracting. Letters in local newspapers demanded government intervention to stop the commercial breaks. Coca-Cola and brewers Carlsberg and Keo, Cyprus's leading sponsors of live coverage, said the commercials will now air only at half-time and at the start and end of games.</p>

			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / East Europe free trade zone plan dropped HUNGARY and Poland have shelved plans for a central-east European free trade zone with Czechoslovakia in favour of a separate bilateral agreement. Mr Jozsef Antall and Mrs Hanna Suchocka, the Hungarian and Polish prime ministers, decided yesterday in Budapest to press ahead alone with liberalisation while the relationship between the Czech lands and Slovakia remains unclear. The two leaders said their goal was bilateral free trade from the start of next year, followed only later by individual agreements with the two halves of Czechoslovakia. Hungary and Poland are treating the Visegrad grouping of central-east European countries as a framework for bilateral agreements rather than as the coherent economic bloc which had been envisaged. The latest move leaves the Central European Co-operation Council, the regional economic grouping launched in April, up in the air. One of the CECCs first decisions was to press ahead with the formation of a free-trade zone covering the three countries in the second half of this year.</p>

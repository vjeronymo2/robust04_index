			<p><P> October 24, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHINA HARD-LINERS FLEX IDEOLOGY  </P> <P> China's guardians of Marxist ideology on Tuesday announced a new campaign  against pornography and Western liberalism and said they will press on with an  anti-crime drive in which hundreds have been executed.  </P> <P> The announcements in the party newspaper People's Daily indicated that the  hard-liners who have dominated Chinese politics since June, 1989, have no  intention of relaxing their hold.  </P> <P> Liu Zhongde, who headed an anti-pornography drive last year, said a new  campaign will clean up the remaining "spiritual pollution and cultural  garbage." In last year's drive, pro-democratic publications as well as  pornography were seized and burned.  </P> <P> Liu said that 12% of the country's newspapers, 13% of its social science  periodicals and more than 7% of its publishing houses have been closed since  June, 1989. He said that 32 million books and magazines have been destroyed and  nearly 80,000 people convicted of illegal publishing.  </P> <P> "This is still just a good beginning," he said.  </P></p>

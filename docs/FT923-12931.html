			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: RTZ to cut holding in PNG gold venture RTZ CORPORATION, the world's biggest mining company, wants to reduce its financial exposure to the Dollars 767m Lihir Island gold project in Papua New Guinea and is negotiating to sell part of its 80 per cent shareholding in the venture to its partner, Niugini Mining. Lihir is one of the world's biggest known gold deposits: there are 42.2m troy ounces of the precious metal in proven and possible reserves. Production is scheduled to start in 1995 at an annual rate of 620,000 ounces for the first five years, building to 900,000 ounces in year 12. The PNG government wants technical negotiations completed before October 31 so RTZ must conclude any deal with Niugini before then. The partners expect the government to take a 20 per cent stake - in return for paying them for 20 per cent of the Dollars 120m costs so far - which would leave RTZ with 64 per cent and Niugini 16 per cent. As RTZ wishes to retain control of the project and manage it, the UK group is unlikely to sell down to below 51 per cent. However, RTZ, while confirming that negotiations are going on, would yesterday give no precise details. Mr Geoff Loudon, chairman of Niugini, said in London yesterday that his company had retained the NM Rothschild bank to ensure that it had finance available 'for all the shares' RTZ might sell. If Niugini needed to sell any of its own shares as part of this process, perhaps via a rights issue, the number would be very small because the company's biggest shareholder, Battle Mountain Gold of the US, was not ready to commit more cash to Niugini but did not wish to see its present 60 per cent shareholding fall below 50 per cent. Lihir will be one of the lowest-cost gold mines with total costs of Dollars 248.75 an ounce in the early years (including Dollars 163 cash operating costs), said Mr Loudon. The feasibility study presented to the PNG government was based on a price of Dollars 350 an ounce. Mr Loudon said it was still hoped that the project would be expanded to increase annual gold output to 1.3m ounces by year 12 but this would double projected capital costs. At present, given the perceived political risks of operating in PNG, it would be extremely difficult to raise the finance for the bigger project.</p>

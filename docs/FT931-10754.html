			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Foreign Exchanges: A morning after feeling THE DOLLAR failed to break above Thursday's peak of DM1.6670 against the D-Mark yesterday, after the January non-farm payroll figure in the US came through as the market had expected, writes James Blitz. The payroll figure rose by 106,000 on the month, slightly less than the market estimate of 109,000. The dollar, which opened at about DM1.6605 in New York, initially climbed  1/3 pfennig on the news, peaked at DM1.6655, but later fell back to close in London at DM1.6545, virtually unchanged on the day. Mr Neil MacKinnon, an economist at Citibank in London, said that the payroll figure had not diverted him from his belief that the dollar will touch DM1.75 or DM1.80 this year. However, he warned that the dollar had gained only 1 pfennigs in the 24 hours between the Bundesbank cutting rates and the payroll figure being issued in the US - and that this should strike a note of caution for dollar bulls. The uncertain note struck by the US data was not dissimilar to the one created by the Bundesbank on Thursday, when it eased monetary policy. The satisfaction that followed the 25 basis point cut in the Discount rate has eased the strains in European exchange mechanism. But there were several indications yesterday that the Bundesbank had, at best, beaten off the speculators for only a few weeks. The Danish krone hovered around its ERM parity of DKr3.814 to the D-Mark, a remarkable jump from Thursday morning when it was trading at the floor. However, 3-month krones continued to be quoted at the remarkably high level of 14 1/2 per cent. If the Danish authorities fail to cut rates soon, they may be putting in jeopardy a Yes vote in the second Danish referendum on the Maastricht treaty on May 18 - the prospect of which would undermine the ERM yet again. The French authorities eased money market tensions by announcing a cut in the overnight rate by  5/16 per cent. This, in turn, brought down 1 month French francs to 11 1/2 per cent from 15 per cent it touched earlier in the week. But the cost of the D-Mark/French parity is not getting cheaper. Last August, 3-month French francs and 3-month D-Marks were both at around 9.75 per cent. In the last 5 months, the D-Marks have come down 140 basis points, while the francs have gone up 175 basis points. Anyone who believes the ERM tensions are over must explain why and when that divergence will stop being a problem for the French.</p>

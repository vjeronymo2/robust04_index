			<p><P> March 6, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MUSIC  </P> <P> A story in the German magazine Opernglas reports that tenor Placido Domingo  will take a long-deferred plunge into the Wagnerian waters of "Tristan" the  season after next. According to the magazine, the emphatically non-German  tenor, who also dabbles in conducting and harbors ambitions to run an opera  company of his own, will sing the unaccustomed title role under the auspices of  the Los Angeles Music Center Opera. (A spokesman for the opera company here  said the project has been under discussion but there are no definite plans or  dates at this point.) Domingo's Isolde would also be a newcomer to this  treacherous challenge: Eva Marton, who just received mixed notices as the  sleazy heroine of the updated "Salome" at the Metropolitan Opera.

			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> SHEARSON STOCK PRICE SLIDES  </P> <P> Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. stock fell sharply today amid reports of a huge  recapitalization plan that would inject up to $1 billion into the ailing  brokerage.  </P> <P> Shearson was down $1.62 1/2, or about 9.85%, at $14.87 1/2 a share in late New  York Stock Exchange trading.  </P> <P> Shearson has been under increasing pressure in recent weeks to take steps to  improve its profitability and avoid a credit downgrading that would tarnish the  firm's reputation and increase its borrowing costs.  </P> <P> American Express Co., which owns 61% of Shearson, reportedly is planning a  public sale of 10 million to 22 million shares of Shearson stock and a direct  investment of about $300 million to raise new capital. In addition, Revlon Inc.  Chairman Ronald O. Perelman reportedly is holding talks about buying a 9.9%  stake in Shearson for about $250 million.  </P> <P> Lawrence A. Armour, an American Express senior vice president, confirmed his  company is "reviewing a number of options" in regard to Shearson. But he said  it would be "inappropriate to discuss any details."  </P> <P> Armour said the review process has been under way for several weeks.  </P></p>

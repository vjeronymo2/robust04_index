			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / Treasury urges rigorous line on spending THE Treasury yesterday issued a stern warning that government spending 'could all too easily' outstrip growth in the economy. It said a rigorous approach to planning and management was required to prevent strong pressures for extra spending threatening the government's policy objectives of reducing total public spending as a share of gross domestic product, cutting taxes 'over time', and bringing the government's Pounds 50bn annual fiscal deficit back towards balance over the medium term. An article published in the latest and final edition of the Treasury Bulletin warned that policy initiatives and influences that had resulted in significant reductions in the ratio of general government expenditure to GDP in the 1980s no longer had a big impact. More significant was the sharp rise of 3 per cent a year in general government expenditure since 1988-89. This acceleration of spending across programmes 'clearly cannot be sustained' if government spending is to fall as a share of national output, it said. The article by a senior Treasury official fleshed out concerns expressed by Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary to the Treasury and cabinet minister responsible for controlling public spending. It underlined why the government has committed itself to firm limits on the growth of spending and why it has launched a rolling programme of root-and-branch reviews questioning the spending programmes of big government departments. The Treasury stressed that the recent sharp rise in public spending mirrored structural as well as cyclical increases that reflected rising expectations and demand for public services. It warned of a number of strong pressures on programmes, which if not checked or offset by action elsewhere, would push public spending higher and threaten the government's main policy goals. These pressures include: Debt interest which is expected to grow at about 9 per cent a year in real terms over the next four years. Invalidity and disability benefit payments, housing benefits, the cost of lone parents and demographic change which were pushing underlining social security spending up by more than 3 per cent a year in real terms. Continuing demands on the health, personal social services and law and order programmes. Bunching of large expenditure projects, especially in transport. The Treasury's long-term plans, published in its March Budget, envisage a gradual fall in the share of general government expenditure - excluding privatisation proceeds - as a percentage of GDP to 43.5 per cent in 1997-98 from a forecast peak of 45.5 per cent in the coming 1994-95 financial year. Before the recent recession, this so-called GGE ratio had declined from a peak of 47.5 per cent of GDP in 1982-83 to 39.25 per cent in 1988-89. Treasury Bulletin Vol 4, Issue 2, Summer 1993. HMSO.

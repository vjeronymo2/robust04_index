Some of the constitutional  articles refer to the duties of the vice president but do not  specify such duties. Rather, they refer to them in general  terms. The source of these jurisdictions is the president of the  republic; that is, he assigns to his deputy whatever tasks he  may deem necessary. Article 82 of the Constitution provides that  if a temporary hindrance arises that prevents the president of  the republic from carrying out his jurisdictions he will assign  the vice president to act on his behalf.    But Article 84 of the Consitution says that in case the post  of president becomes vacant or he becomes permanently incapable  of carrying out his duties, the People's Assembly speaker  assumes the post temporarily. If the Assembly is disbanded, he  will be replaced by the chairman of the Higher Constitutional  Court, on the condition that neither will be nominated for the  presidency, as Clause 2 of Article 85 provides, until the vice  president assumes the presidency temporarily pending judgment is  passed on charge of high treason against the president of the  republic or of committing a crime, on the basis of a proposal  submitted by at least one-third of the People's Assembly  members. The indictment shall be passed by a two-thirds  majority, something that is almost impossible to happen.    On the basis of this, we draw the following conclusion:    First: The appointment of one vice president or more is  optional for the president of the republic and not obligatory as  it is in the case of appointing the prime minister, his  deputies, the ministers, and their deputies (Article 141).    Second: It is the president of the republic who determines  the jurisdictions of the vice president or vice presidents and  relieves them of their posts. This means that the post of vice  president, like that of the ministers, is appointed and relieved  of his posts by the president of the republic.    Third: The vice president, if there is one, has no  jurisdictions other than acting for the president in case of a  temporary hindrance that prevents the president of the republic  from exercising his jurisdictions.    Briefly, there is no justification for the appointment of  one  vice president of the republic or more under the present  constitution, particularly since President Husni Mubarak did not  wish to use his right to appoint one vice president or more.  Rather, during the past 12 years he remained without a deputy,  thus using his constitutional right to that. We believe that the  new constitution could provide for the election of a vice  president alobg with a vice president who would automatically  take over powers in case the president is temporarily absent. He  will assume the presidency until the expiration of the  president's term, in case the post of president of the republic  becomes vacant or the president will be permanently  incapacitated.</p>

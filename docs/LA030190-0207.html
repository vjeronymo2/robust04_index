			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: REPARATIONS FOR SLAVES' DESCENDANTS  SUPPORTED  </P> <P> The Inglewood City Council has agreed to support the concept of federal  government reparations for the descendants of slaves, but only after the  resolution was broadened to include other ethnic groups that have suffered  discrimination.  </P> <P> A strongly worded resolution introduced by Councilman Garland Hardeman lamented  the "barbarities of institutionalized slavery" on African-Americans and urged  Congress to support a bill introduced by Rep. John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.) to  create a congressional committee to study reparations for slaves' descendants.  </P> <P> To win the support of the city's two non-black councilmen, the measure noted  that the city abhors injustices to all groups, but did not seek reparations.  </P></p>

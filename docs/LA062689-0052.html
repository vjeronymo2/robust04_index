			<p><P> June 26, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRISIS IN CHINA HAS HONG KONG INVESTORS LOOKING TO SOUTHLAND  </P> <P> For years, many Hong Kong-owned companies have been reluctant to invest large  sums in Southern California or elsewhere in the United States, seeing  investment returns back home in the colony as superior and fearing being  labeled as unpatriotic. But the recent violence and unrest in China is making  those few Hong Kong companies that have invested large sums here feel somewhat  vindicated.  </P> <P> Take International Landmark Group. The company, which years ago began  developing shopping and housing projects in Los Angeles' Chinatown and Monterey  Park, is working on new residential and shopping complexes in Los Angeles and  Oakland. Other purchases under study or negotiation: a U.S. real estate holding  company, a West Coast financial institution and a five-star New York hotel.  </P> <P> "We have been diversifying in the U.S. and in other countries in the last 10  years, way before the latest Chinese incidents," says Joseph M. Chan, president  and chief executive of International Landmark. "But the recent incidents in  China confirmed we have made a wise choice, and we will continue to diversify  as planned."  </P> <P> Chan adds that a friend in Hong Kong who runs a large garment manufacturing  firm is looking to acquire or set up some manufacturing operations in Southern  California.  </P> <P> These and other examples add up to expectations of a growing presense of Hong  Kong companies and individual investors in Southern California in the wake of  the recent Beijing massacres and subsequent Chinese government crackdown on  dissidents.  </P> <P> Some Hong Kong companies and investors began buying Southern California real  estate or setting up businesses here years ago, long before the 1984 agreement  by Great Britain to turn over the colony to China, or before the unrest in  China. But many others have been reluctant to enter the market here, in part  because the Hong Kong economy was booming and because investing here would have  been seen as a sign of a lack of confidence in the colony's future.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Attitude Changed  </P> <P> But the Chinese unrest -- coming along with Hong Kong's rising labor costs, a  "brain drain" of talented people out of the colony and attractive prices in the  United States -- has caused a change in attitude.  </P> <P> Concerns about China already have resulted in an initial spurt of capital  flight from Hong Kong into Southern California in the form of savings deposits  and other cash investments, bankers report.  </P> <P> Investments in real estate and new business ventures by nature will take longer  to develop, partly because it may take awhile for Hong Kong firms and investors  to get money freed up. With Hong Kong real estate prices plummeting 20% to 25%  since the Beijing massacres, many prospective real estate sellers are finding  few buyers.  </P> <P> But in the coming months and years, local experts expect more Hong Kong firms  in such industries as garment manufacturing and trade to set up manufacturing,  sales and distribution branches here.  </P> <P> Real estate investments by Hong Kong investors -- until now relatively small  and generally not involving glamorous, high-profile "trophy" properties -- may  become larger and more noticeable. And they will be increasingly outside  communities with large Chinese populations, such as Chinatown or Monterey Park,  which Hong Kong investors initially favored.  </P> <P> "We are beginning to see loan requests from people in Hong Kong to purchase  property in California," says Dunson Cheng, president of Los Angeles-based  Cathay Bank.  </P> <P> "A lot of my friends are coming to L.A." to look for acquisitions, says Y. Y.  Chan, a Chinese-American businessman in Los Angeles who serves on a California  state advisory panel that encourages greater Asian investment here. One such  Hong Kong friend, Chan notes, visited Southern California this month looking to  spend $5 million on a shopping center, possibly in Los Angeles, Orange or San  Diego counties.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Didn't Trust Pact  </P> <P> To be sure, not all Hong Kong investors think the upheaval in China has really  changed things all that much and that the colony's economy will recover from  the initial shock of the Beijing massacres.  </P> <P> "People in China never trusted the agreement between China and Britain anyway,"  contended Joseph Poon, vice president of Taico Properties, a Los Angeles  subsidiary of Tai Cheung Properties, a Hong Kong hotel and real estate firm.  Taico has developed several housing, office and industrial projects throughout  Southern California, and the latest events in China won't affect its plans for  others a great deal, Poon says.  </P> <P> "We'll just keep doing the same thing we've been doing," Poon says. "I don't  detect a knee-jerk reaction from the home office."  </P> <P> But for others, latent fears that China may renege on its agreement to preserve  the free-wheeling capitalist system in Hong Kong after it takes over the colony  in 1997 are far more real.  </P> <P> Hong Kong was the largest foreign investor in China, but many from the colony  now see the Chinese market as less attractive from a pure economic standpoint.  </P> <P> Manufacturing operations in Guangdong Province in southern China, attractive to  Hong Kong firms because of dirt-cheap labor and reliable production, suddenly  seem more risky. Possible labor unrest or political instability could  jeopardize tight production schedules, says Frederick M. Chan, president of Nu  West Cos., a Los Angeles-based real estate firm that in recent days has had  discussions with Hong Kong investors about possible joint ventures in Southern  California real estate.  </P> <P> Hong Kong also seems less attractive, with experts there predicting an end to  the real estate boom while an annual exodus of about 45,000 residents has  created shortages of talented workers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Now Must Diversify  </P> <P> Thus, some of the investment that would have gone into Hong Kong or China may  begin to flow into Southeast Asia, South America, Australia, Canada, Mexico and  the United States.  </P> <P> "Hong Kong investors in the past had not expressed a strong interest in the  U.S. because the returns in Hong Kong were so good," Frederick Chan says. "But  now they feel they have to diversify."  </P> <P> Investment here from Hong Kong is still expected to trail that from Japan,  South Korea and Taiwan, which have bigger economies and more investment money  to bring here.  </P> <P> And Southern California is not the No. 1 choice for Hong Kong investment in  North America. That distinction belongs to Vancouver, because Canada offers  more favorable tax treatment to foreigners and allows Hong Kong nationals to  gain immigration visas and eventual citizenship if they invest minimal levels  into job-creating activities. Such investment has triggered a real estate boom  in Vancouver.  </P> <P> Other Hong Kong natives still prefer investing in the San Francisco Bay Area  because of its large Chinese-American community.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, Hong Kong investors are finding Southern California attractive for  several reasons.  </P> <P> One is the fast growth of the market here, which is gaining over San Francisco  as the U.S. gateway to the Pacific Rim. Hong Kong is the fourth-largest trading  partner with the Los Angeles area, with slightly less than $4 billion in goods  from the British colony flowing through Los Angeles ports and customs  facilities last year, according to the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce.  That trailed Japan's $31 billion, Taiwan's $10.6 billion and South Korea's  $10.2 billion.  </P> <P> "In many ways, the Los Angeles area is like Hong Kong because we've been  growing like crazy," says Jack Kyser, chief economist for the chamber, which  lists at least 75 to 100 Hong Kong companies or subsidiaries operating in the  Los Angeles area.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Way to Skirt Quotas  </P> <P> Hong Kong businesses also are attracted by the large Asian population here and  by the large presense here of industries they are familiar with, such as  apparel, electronics and toy wholesaling, Kyser says.  </P> <P> Some Hong Kong clothing manufacturers see the need to set up U.S. production  facilities to overcome U.S. textile quotas that limit garment imports, says Y.  Y. Chan, the local businessman encouraging greater Asian investment here. Also,  he contends, while labor in Hong Kong and China is cheaper relative to that  here and there are fewer labor laws and regulations in Asia, manufacturing in  the United States can ensure quicker delivery into the market and, in some  cases, greater quality control. Also, Chan says, land here is cheap compared to  that in Hong Kong and San Francisco.  </P> <P> In addition, many of the younger generation of Hong Kong businessmen have  studied in Southern California, are more sophisticated in Western ways and have  friends here.  </P> <P> Much of the investment so far has been focused on real estate, the preferred  investment for many Hong Kong nationals because of its security and permanence.  Total Hong Kong real estate investment here is difficult to measure, in part  because investors from the colony often buy through corporations, banks or  other entities that obscure the true identity of their owners. Many Hong Kong  investors prefer to remain low-key, generally avoiding publicity.  </P> <P> Hong Kong investment here also is difficult to measure because investors have  largely shied away from buying high-profile trophy properties such as large  downtown skyscrapers or posh hotels. A survey last year by the Massachusetts  Institute of Technology Center for Real Estate Development failed to find a  single major downtown Los Angeles building owned by Hong Kong interests.  </P> <P> </P> <P> More Value-Oriented  </P> <P> One notable exception to this hesitancy to buy trophy properties was the  $100-million 1985 purchase of the Beverly Wilshire Hotel by the Regent hotel  firm of Hong Kong.  </P> <P> "Hong Kong investors have been unwilling to pay the premiums that the Japanese  pay in order to acquire trophy properties. They've been more value-oriented  investors," says Clifton K. Chang, a partner at Altair Investment Co., a Los  Angeles real estate firm that works with Hong Kong investors to find  properties.  </P> <P> Instead, Hong Kong investors have started by buying single-family homes, small  shopping centers, medical centers, apartment complexes or other developments,  often in the $1-million to $10-million range and often in Chinatown, Monterey  Park or other communities with high Asian populations, says Randal J. Lee,  president of Lilly Enterprises Inc., a Los Angeles real estate brokerage and  property-management concern.  </P> <P> Hong Kong investors own, built or have proposed at least five shopping malls,  office or residential developments in Los Angeles' Chinatown, according to  Kenneth Leventhal &amp; Co., a Los Angeles accounting firm.  </P> <P> But now, some investors who have been here awhile and have learned the ropes  are beginning to set their sights on bigger acquisitions -- and have the  financial wherewithal to pull them off, experts say. And other large investors  that previously shied away from this market are taking a second look.  </P> <P> One of the more aggressive of this new breed is International Landmark Group,  the Los Angeles-based subsidiary of Park Lane International, a Hong Kong  conglomerate that operates the Park Lane Hotel chain.  </P> <P> The firm started in the United States by investing in Chinatown and other  Chinese-American centers, says Joseph Chan, chief executive.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Has Branched Out  </P> <P> Plans include building a 100,000-plus square-foot shopping center at Hill and  Ord streets in Chinatown, across the street from another shopping mall the firm  is renovating. International Landmark is also developing a $250-million retail,  residential and office complex in Oakland Chinatown.  </P> <P> But the firm has also branched out beyond Chinese-American communities. It was  one of the first Hong Kong firms to develop a U.S. hotel from scratch, when it  completed in 1984 the Park 55 Hotel in San Francisco, formerly called the  Ramada Renaissance.  </P> <P> Now, more than half of the parent firm's portfolio is diversified outside Hong  Kong in Australia, Canada, the United States and elsewhere, Chan says. Five  years ago, the degree of diversification was less than half.  </P> <P> "Everybody's gone through a learning experience," Chan says. "At first it's a  little safer to stay in your back yard, which is Chinese, and when you  understand the market better, you can then reach out to other markets. We like  to think we understand the market a little bit better than we used to."  </P> <P> Chan says the firm has identified a real estate holding company it wishes to  negotiate to purchase as a way of acquiring a group of properties in one swoop.  Plans to buy a bank or savings and loan, preferably on the West Coast, will be  a natural complement to the firm's real estate activities, Chan says.  </P> <P> The firm also expects to complete its acquisition of an as-yet unnamed  five-star hotel in New York in a couple of months.  </P> <P> "People in Hong Kong will buy trophy things, but not necessarily at the extreme  high prices" paid by the Japanese, Chan says. The New York hotel, he says, "is  somewhat of a trophy property, but we're not paying a trophy price."  </P></p>

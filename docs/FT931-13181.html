			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / International Company News: DAF plan for recovery endorsed TWO management consul-tancies are understood to have endorsed the main elements of a recovery plan drawn up by DAF, the beleaguered Dutch truck maker, opening the way for substantial extra financial aid backed by the Dutch and Belgian governments. Following a meeting of DAF's supervisory board at the weekend, the company's 13,000 employees in the Netherlands, Belgium and at its Leyland DAF truck and van-making subsidiary in the UK are expected to be told tomorrow how they will be affected by further cost-cutting and job losses. At the same time, DAF is expected to indicate what progress it is making to secure further financing in talks with its banks and the Dutch and Belgium governments. These could lead to any of the parties taking or expanding equity stakes. Leading shareholders include ABN-AMRO Bank with 8.2 per cent and the Dutch insurance groups ING and Aegon with 10.6 per cent and 6.4 per cent respectively. In spite of industry rumours that DAF is considering plant closures, the immediate measures are understood to concentrate on further squeezing costs. DAF has cut its work force by 4,000 people since the end of 1989, and had intended to reduce this to under 12,000 people by the end of this year even before the latest recovery plan. The hope is that further belt-tightening, combined with fresh finance, will allow DAF to survive until it can be bailed out by recovery in European, and particularly UK, commercial vehicle markets. It expects this to emerge in the second half of this year. Tomorrow is unlikely to resolve the uncertainty surrounding the company's plans to invest about Pounds 250m (Dollars 375m) in a successor to the Leyland DAF vans built by 2,000 employees at the former Freight Rover van plant in Birmingham. DAF, in which British Aerospace holds a 10.9 per cent stake, is under strong pressure from Renault, its partner in the project, to make a firm manufacturing commitment. But DAF's financial crisis, following three years of heavy losses, has led Renault to make contingency plans against DAF withdrawing. Mr Koos Andriessen, the Dutch minister of economic affairs, has indicated his willingness to try to arrange up to 'several hundred millions of guilders' of additional help for DAF from the banks and Dutch and Belgian governments. Belgium's Flemish regional government is willing to provide extra help now that the reports from the two consultancies, Arthur D. Little and Coopers &amp; Lybrand Dijker Van Dien, are known to be sympathetic to DAF's plans. Such funding would be additional to the Fl 190m (Dollars 110m) in state-backed loans DAF secured in December but which it quickly acknowledged would not be enough in the face of a bigger-than-expected net loss for 1992-93. This is now expected to be higher than the F1 100m net loss forecast at last year's half-way stage, particularly as some provision for tomorrow's cuts will have to be included. Cumulative losses exceed Fl 700m.</p>

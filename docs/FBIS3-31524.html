			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] [Announcer] We telephoned Foreign Minister Geza  Jeszenszky and asked him the opinion of the Hungarian Government  about Sarajevo.    [Jeszenszky] [passage omitted] Russian mediation played a  significant role here, not only insofar as Russia has persuaded  the Serbs -- who have always been inclined to listen to Russian  advice -- it has persuaded them to withdraw the weapons, but  also insofar as Russia is filling the vacuum, and that Russian  troops, in whom the Serbs perhaps have confidence, more  confidence, are taking over control, at least in part, in these  areas.</p>

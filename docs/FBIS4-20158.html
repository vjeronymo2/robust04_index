			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Rome RAI Uno Television Network in  Italian during its news program at 2100 GMT on 27 April carries  a 22-minute interview with Northern League leader Umberto Bossi.    Asked to comment on the possible division of the Interior  Ministry, Bossi says: "Local government need not be run by the  same ministry that runs the police, the country's security.  These two things are different, which is how they should be.  What is being discussed is not the separation of the ministry's  local government sector from its security sector. The Interior  Ministry is what we are discussing. We believe it is essential,  it is in the League's hands to offer the country and ourselves  guarantees. In the government coalition, there are parties that  have their origins in the Christian Democratic Party, and if  they are given the Interior Ministry, this would mean complete  continuity with the old government."    Bossi confirms this is why the Northern League is opposed to  the idea of former President Francesco Cossiga becoming interior  minister. He says that if the League does not obtain the  Interior Ministry, he would be happy with the Ministry of the  Autonomous Regions. He says: "If the League does not obtain the  guarantee that it can carry out certain checks -- I say this  again and stress it in the country's interest -- in the interest  of democracy, we could, we would still support the government,  but we would do this from the outside."    Bossi says he is completely opposed to Radical leader Marco  Pannella being appointed foreign minister. He says that Forza  Italia is wrong to see Pannella as some sort of bridge with the  Left, and that he is not the right man for such an important and  sensitive post.    Bossi also stresses what he saw as the need for an  anti-trust  law: "The situation is difficult with a prime minister like  Berlusconi, who is an eminent businessman. I do not mean that  eminent businessman should not be politicians or become prime  ministers. They can, but on certain conditions, that is, on  condition that there is no conflict of private and public  interest. It is clear and easy to understand why this should be.  A series of legal complaints could be made, which could bring  the government to a standstill."    Bossi says that the Northern League also wants the Treasury  Ministry: "Without exaggerating, the League believes that it is  very important we have the Treasury Ministry and not the Budget  Ministry, which is what we have been offered, because the  Treasury Ministry controls spending. If we do not have control  over spending and the country's security, it would be like  asking the League to sign a blank check. In a situation where  the prime minister is an eminent businessman, in a country  without a serious, real anti-trust law -- there is an anti-trust  law; we started off with an anti-trust law based on sectors, and  four or five years ago, for the first time, we voted in an  anti-trust law; but it is controlled politically -- there is a  political guarantor rather than the ordinary judiciary. The  results of this anti-trust law are plain to see: they are the  bankruptcy of important sectors such as steel and chemicals."    Bossi says he believes a privatization policy should be  aimed  at creating widespread ownership and not selling state assets to  a few powerful families.</p>

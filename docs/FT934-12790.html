			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Heseltine in strategy talks with TV chiefs MR Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, has called together Britain's leading broadcasters to try to draw up a co-ordinated industrial and export strategy for the industry. Those invited include Mr John Birt, the Director General of the BBC, Mr Greg Dyke, chairman of the ITV Association and chief executive of London Weekend Television, Mr Michael Grade, chief executive of Channel 4, Mr Michael Green, chairman of Carlton Communications and Independent Television News, and Mr Leslie Hill, chairman of Central Independent Television. The meeting to be held on November 3 symbolises a sea change in the government's attitude to UK broadcasting. It contrasts with a notorious meeting in 1987 when the then prime minister Mrs Margaret Thatcher gave broadcasters a dressing down and denounced ITV as 'the last bastion of restricted practices'. In contrast the emphasis of next week's meeting will be to encourage the export potential of a UK industry seen as high quality and internally competitive. Mr Heseltine's search for an industrial and export strategy could have significant policy implications for ITV and the BBC. The big ITV companies arguing for changes in the rules of ownership to allow the largest nine ITV companies to take each other over see Mr Heseltine as a powerful likely ally. They argue that ITV is too fragmented to compete internationally. They are opposed by medium-sized companies who emphasise the importance of regionalism. A ministerial committee chaired by Mr John Major, prime minister, will decide on the ownership issue later this year. The implications of the present trend in policy could be just as important for the BBC whose Royal Charter runs out at the end of 1996. Mr Heseltine has been looking at the export potential of an integrated BBC with a world-famous brand name and the corporation's fast-moving plans to take BBC World Service Television around the globe. As a sign of the reduced hostility to the corporation, the National Heritage Department has proposed the BBC licence fee should be linked to retail prices for three years - but this has to be approved by other ministers.</p>

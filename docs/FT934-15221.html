			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / Coal chief pessimistic on pits' future MR NEIL CLARKE, British Coal chairman, said yesterday he was pessimistic about saving any of the pits selected for closure a year ago. The fears extend beyond the 12 mines reprieved in March after a public outcry. Pit managers believe some of the 19 'core pits' which have never been earmarked in public for closure are also vulnerable. A delegation from the Trades Union Congress will tomorrow meet Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, to press him to halt pit closures and extend redundancy arrangements for miners beyond December 31. The unions are arguing for a 'balanced energy policy making full use of all resources'. British Coal has closed 21 pits since March, but still operates 30. Industry analysts believe the market can sustain fewer than 15. British Coal is keen to win ministerial approval to start the closure programme at one or two pits. Depending on the reaction, other closures are expected to follow in the following months. The option of closing a large number of pits simultaneously has been ruled out. Mr Steve Tulley, an official of the National Union of Mineworkers at the Frickley pit in the Yorkshire region, said miners at his pit believed closure was inevitable. He said: 'It is worth fighting for but the will is not there in the industry. We are totally demoralised.' Since the white paper in March, the coal industry's problems have been exacerbated by a better-than-expected performance from nuclear power stations and an acceleration in gas-fired generation. The two largest generating companies have indicated they are unlikely to take substantial amounts of coal in this financial year, ending next March, in addition to the amount they have agreed to take. Almost 1m tonnes of coal is being stockpiled at pitheads each month to add to the 14m held by British Coal and the generators' 36m. Some 20,400 mineworkers and 2,100 white-collar staff have taken redundancy since October, leaving just 30,100 workers in an industry which once employed more than 1m. Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, said the government had not tackled the 'rigged market' in electricity against coal.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Letter from "the Embassy of the Islamic Republic of Iran in </F> Amman"]    [Excerpts] [greeting passage omitted] Your esteemed  newspaper on 31 January published an article on page 18 by Dr.  Muhammad al-Mahasinah under the headline "Was Na'ib al-Ma'ayitah  a Victim of Polarization or Peace?" In view of the errors  contained in the article and given the freedom of the press and  opinion, we would like to have the following explanation  published with our thanks and appreciation. [passage omitted] We  find it necessary to reply to what Dr. al-Mahasinah wrote in his  article.    1. The Embassy of the Islamic Republic of Iran denounces and  condemns the terrorist and cowardly act which led to the death  of Na'ib al-Ma'ayitah in Beirut. The embassy can only extend  its sincere sympathy and condolences to his family and the  sisterly Jordanian family as a whole and to beseech God almighty  to have mercy on his soul and to grant his family solace and  patience.    2. It is a source of consternation that this article, which  lacks objectivity and logic, should be written by a Jordanian  figure of the status of Dr. al-Mahasinah, who is the professor  of law at the university. In his article, al-Mahasinah tried in  vain to link this cowardly act with the Islamic Republic of  Iran's stand on the so-called peace or with the issue of the  reduction of the number of Iranian diplomats in Jordan. [passage  omitted]    Dr. al-Mahasinah should not have announced his stand off the  cuff. He should have waited until things became clear and facts  became solid before leveling accusations at others. In order to  put him in the picture along with others who do not know, we say  that the Islamic Republic of Iran's stand toward the Zionist  enemy is a principled and constant stand that will not change  one iota under any circumstance. This stand was not developed  yesterday or by chance. Indeed, it is older than the victorious  Islamic revolution in Iran. History recorded the Islamic and  principled stands adopted by Imam Khomeyni, may God sanctify his  secret, throughout his life against the occupying enemy whether  in the Shah's dungeons, in exile, or in power. Therefore, our  stand toward what is now called the peace process emanates from  this principled and deep-rooted stand.    As regards the issue of reducing the number of Iranian  diplomats in Jordan, we would like to emphasize that the warm  relations between the two fraternal countries, which are  permeated by the spirit of brotherhood and love, are proceeding  forward under the wise leadership of the two countries.    For our part, we are concerned about maintaining these  relations and we will not allow anyone to undermine them. From  this particular premise, we say that the reduction of the number  of diplomats is purely an organizational issue as stated by  responsible quarters in Jordan. Here, we also reaffirm our  concern about maintaining the higher interest of the two  countries and about proceeding forward with these active  relations no matter what the sacrifices are. We have no doubt  at all that the Jordanian leadership shares the same feeling and  that the recent statements by the wise leadership in Jordan are  evidence of this. Hence, while we reiterate our deep regret  about what was written outside the realm of logic, we ask the  honorable and esteemed SAWT AL-SHA'B newspaper to be accurate  and cautious more than ever before.    [Signed] The Embassy of The Islamic Republic of Iran in  Amman.</p>

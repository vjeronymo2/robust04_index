			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Chris Louw] </F>   [Text] Serious concern has surfaced in the National Party  [NP, Nats] about the ANC's commitment to consensus  decision-making in the new cabinet of national unity, following  the announcement of the final cabinet by President Nelson  Mandela.    NP sources claimed Mandela had reneged on two undertakings:  that he would announce the new cabinet only after consulting  Deputy President F.W. de Klerk, and that he would share the four  security portfolios of defence, safety and security (formerly  law and order), justice and correctional services between the NP  and the ANC.    The NP also fears that real power will not reside with the  cabinet, but that important policy decisions will be taken by  the ANC's National Executive Committee [NEC], with cabinet  serving as a mere rubber stamp.    ANC Secretary General Cyril Ramaphosa's decision not to join  the cabinet was described as "a worrying development". Senior  Nats consider Ramaphosa highly ambitious and likely to assert  his influence from outside the executive, leading to a shift in  the balance of power between the NEC and the cabinet and the  isolation of NP cabinet members.    Ramaphosa is known to have made enemies, some within his own  party, since the Transitional Executive Council began operating  last year. Opponents say the wide powers he wielded during the  transition have gone to his head, and that he has become "aloof  and arrogant".    Said one senior NP source: "We cannot conceivably be  satisfied with serving as a rubber stamp for decisions taken by  the ANC's NEC. The next few weeks will show whether everyone in  the ANC's top echelons understands the notion of consensus  government and nation-building."    The sources said Mandela's "premature announcement" last  Friday of the ANC's list of cabinet proposals contradicted  agreements with the NP leadership. Discussions with De Klerk  had not been finalised when the names were made public, they  said.    Rumour had it this week that the early announcement of the  ANC's cabinet list -- before negotiations between De Klerk and  Mandela were completed -- was the result of pressure from senior  NEC members.    One NP parliamentarian speculated that members of a "cabal"  in the NEC had dismissed NP claims that a mutiny might follow  the failure to appoint an NP person as minister in a key  security portfolio. "They want the security forces to know  right away who's the boss" he said.</p>

			<p><P> August 23, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> KOUT MAKES BOWL DEBUT  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Philharmonic is enjoying a late-summer reprieve from its  grueling al-fresco schedule this week. Nevertheless, business goes on as usual  at Hollywood Bowl.  </P> <P> For three big concerts beginning tonight, the shell will be populated by the  rapidly rising Seattle Symphony under Gerard Schwarz. For the little concert on  Tuesday, the visiting honors fell to the ensemble that Schwarz had served as  music director from 1978-86: the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra.  </P> <P> The guest conductor on this occasion originally was to have been Christoph  Perick, who had performed similar duties last year. A back injury, however, has  forced the German maestro to cancel all his current engagements, including  "Cosi fan Tutte" at the Music Center next April.  </P> <P> In his place, the Chamber Orchestra engaged Jiri Kout, the Czechoslovakian  maestro from Berlin, who happened to be in town preparing "Fidelio" for our  opera company.  </P> <P> Kout (pronounced "Coat") is a seasoned professional. He also happens to be a  musician of discerning taste as well as a solid technician.  </P> <P> He doesn't seem to care about being a showy personality on the podium --  nothing wrong with that -- and he isn't equally persuasive in all challenges.  Janacek's "Kat'a Kabanova," which he conducted here in 1988, suits him.  Strauss' "Rosenkavalier," which he inherited from Carlos Kleiber at the Munich  Festival, may not.  </P> <P> In the vast open spaces of the Bowl, he suggested that he enjoys a definite  affinity for Mozart. He savors gentle accents, subtle dynamics and delicate  balances. He avoids exaggeration. Although he favors brisk allegros and piquant  prestos, he invariably stresses the value of lyrical grace when introspective  contrast is wanted.  </P> <P> He did not -- perhaps, given rehearsal limitations, could not -- inspire the  Chamber Orchestra to play with maximum confidence or precision at every turn.  The string phrasing sometimes sounded tentative in moments of agitation.  Statements that might have been elegantly polished occasionally emerged blurry.  Still, the massed spirit remained willing.  </P> <P> Kout and company opened the agreeably brief program with the cheer of Mozart's  "Figaro" overture and continued with the sunny adventures of the Symphony No.  30. The evening ended happily with the relatively grandiose flourishes of the  Symphony No. 39.  </P> <P> At showpiece time, just before intermission, Thomas Stevens appeared als Gast  to toss off Joseph Haydn's intricate Trumpet Concerto in E-flat. The Los  Angeles Philharmonic principal -- no night off for him -- played with  virtuosity that seemed all the more dazzling for its nonchalance.  </P> <P> Stevens' tone remained bright, steady and flexible, no matter how circuitous  the coloratura flight. He could offer object lessons in stylish bravura to many  a bel-canto diva and divo.  </P> <P> The orchestra provided the soloist with sensitive, ever-attentive support.  After all his years in the opera-house pit, Kout knows exactly when to lead and  when to follow.  </P> <P> The audience, surprisingly large for so subdued an event, was officially  tabulated at 11,291.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 3, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NORTHWEST AIRLINES COULD BUY EASTERN  </P> <P> Northwest Airlines is considering the purchase of troubled Eastern Airlines and  is slated to meet with Eastern's unions to determine if the carrier's labor  problems can be solved, it was reported today.  </P> <P> The Washington Post, citing sources, reported that representatives of the  International Assn. of Machinists met Monday to discuss the problems of  integrating Eastern employees into Northwest as a prelude to talks later this  week between Northwest Chairman Alfred A. Checchi and John Peterpaul, vice  president of the IAM.  </P> <P> The newspaper quoted Northwest spokesman Doug Miller as saying the  Minnesota-based airline is examining all its options for growth and expansion.  </P> <P> "We are not in a position to discuss the options we are reviewing, nor should  anyone conclude that such an examination will lead to a transaction," he said.  </P> <P> The newspaper said Northwest approached Eastern trustee Martin Shugrue about  buying some of the Miami-based carrier's airport gates in Atlanta and some of  its maintenance facilities but was rebuffed.  </P> <P> Shugrue, who was appointed by the bankruptcy court last April to replace Frank  Lorenzo and his management team, "made it very clear that parts of the airline  are not for sale. It is the whole airline," the newspaper said.  </P> <P> Creditors apparently feel that Eastern cannot survive on its own and that a  sale is the only way they can recoup their money. "I think the creditors' group  hopes it can be sold," a source told the newspaper.  </P> <P> Eastern filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in March, 1989, just days  after the IAM struck in a bitter contract dispute and was joined on the picket  line by pilots and flight attendants.  </P> <P> The airline was almost shut down but managed, with the help of attendants and  pilots who crossed the picket line and newly trained pilots, to return to the  air on an abbreviated schedule. The carrier is still believed to be losing $1  million per day, the newspaper said.  </P> <P> Shugrue took over with a promise to seek labor peace, but talks with the Air  Line Pilots Assn. broke down last week when the union rejected his offer to  recall 650 pilots and restore their seniority over three years. Hard-line  pilots want a more complete restoration of their seniority over strikebreakers.  </P></p>

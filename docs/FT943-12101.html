			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / People: Salomon adds weight for European equities Salomon Brothers has hired American Albert Richards, as part of its push into the European equities business. Richards, 33, joins from CS First Boston where he was director of European sector research and European chemicals analyst. He is due to start at Salomon in September as vice president and manager of European equity research, and will be based in London. Given his impressive list of academic achievements, which include a doctorate in chemical engineering and a master's degree in management from MIT by the age of 25, Richards clearly relishes the chance of putting all his hard-earned theoretical experience into operation at Salomon's. 'The niche which investment banks can fill best in Europe is to provide fundamental, long-term industry-oriented research,' says Richards. His appointment comes just one month after news that Salomon Brothers was sending Rodney Berens, a member of the firm's 12-strong executive committee, to London as part of its drive to raise Salomon's profile in European equity markets. Salomon lost around half of its analysts in the wake of the US Treasury scandal in 1991, but since then it has been steadily re-building its team. It now has five sector analysts and six country strategists, though it is looking for analysts to cover telecoms, media, capital goods and autos. Berens is confident that Salomon's return to the European equities business will be even more successful than its rehabilitation in the bond market, where it is once again regarded as a powerhouse. 'In the long term I would like the equities side to be even more profitable than bonds, but I will settle for a tie,' he says.</p>

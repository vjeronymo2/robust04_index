			<p><P> May 8, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> The Australian Open, long considered the least prestigious of tennis' four  major titles, could lose its Grand Slam status unless prize money is sharply  increased, the tournament's general manager said.  </P> <P> Jim Reid said the tournament was having a hard time matching the purses offered  by the three other Grand Slam events -- Wimbledon, the French Open and the U.S.  Open.  </P> <P> Last year, Wimbledon offered $5.2 million, followed by the U.S. Open with $5.1  million, the French Open with $4.5 million and the Australian Open with $3  million.  </P> <P> This year, Wimbledon is offering $6.4 million -- more than double the  Australian purse.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with M.Sh. Shaymiyev, president of Tatarstan, by </F> A. Leksina on 30 April; place not given: "`The Treaty Could Ease  the Situation'"]    [Text] As reported, M.Sh. Shaymiyev, president of  Tatarstan, left immediately following completion of the session  of the Supreme Soviet of the Republic of Tatarstan for Moscow to  take part in the work of the Federation Council and to sign the  Social Accord Treaty. The president returned to Kazan late in  the evening of 29 April and the following day granted an  interview to correspondents of republic newspapers.    [Leksina] Mintimer Sharipovich, many different declarations  have been adopted as of late, but our problems and misfortunes  remain with us, as before. In signing the Social Accord Treaty  were you not hoping that it could fundamentally change the  situation on the difficult path of political and economic  reforms?    [Shaymiyev] No, I was not. Neither this nor any other  document, however carefully it has been drawn up, should be  overestimated. But this treaty has a number of clauses whose  practical embodiment could ease the situation and forestall many  surprises. It was worth taking part in its signing if only, as  it says, to ensure that no force be used in the solution of  problems that arise and that in the already troubled times  demands for early elections and the creation of various military  formations not arise. You know my position, I have always  advocated accord, and I accept no other way. The birth of this  document, however, was caused by the fact that certain political  forces have after the adoption of the constitution continued to  make demands that go beyond the framework of the constitution,  which, of course, has not contributed to the desired  stabilization. Accord, however, which I hope will be achieved,  should help us.    [Leksina] But you signed the treaty with amendments....    [Shaymiyev] Yes, there were many criticisms. They were  cogent  and presented officially, which is particularly important. After  all, a conciliation commission, to which it will always be  possible to appeal, should the need arise, will be formed. I  insisted in Moscow at the meeting of heads of the republics on  the removal of a number of provisions which could evoke actions  the opposite of accord. I note with satisfaction that two-thirds  of our observations were adopted.    The value of the document that was signed lies, further, in  the fact that it contains many positions concerning the rights  of the individual and whole peoples. The need for support even  for small diasporas in their aspiration to knowledge of the  culture of their people and development of the language is  emphasized. Any support-- both material and moral--is important  here.    [Leksina] I would like to know whether the Tatar diaspora of  some region sought support from you specifically.    [Shaymiyev] There are many such appeals. Specifically, the  Samara diaspora had asked that I lend some assistance in the  organization of a Tatar newspaper and put in a good word, so to  speak, with the local authorities. I met in Moscow this time  with K. Titov, head of the administration of Samara Oblast. We  talked about a newspaper. The Tatar people are greatly attracted  to their own national culture, however fate has scattered them.  We are asked frequently not only to send textbooks and books in  Tatar but also to organize tours by performing artistes. This is  understandable, such meetings are spiritually enriching to both  sides.    [Leksina] We know that you met in Moscow with Boris  Nikolayevich Yeltsin.    [Shaymiyev] We thought about how to "force" the  Russian-Tatar  treaty to function with maximum efficiency and to ensure that a  variety of bureaucrats not impede us en route to its  realization. We will set up a commission for coordinated  supervision, and the progress of fulfillment of the treaty  obligations will be examined at the highest level several times  a year. The question of how to strengthen Tatarstan's economic  independence within the framework of the agreement that has  already been signed was broached also. It is not so much a  question of Russia's position here as of the obstacles we are  creating for ourselves. Although some people continue to blame  Russia for all the misfortunes. This was seen also during  discussion of the budget at the last session. Shaymiyev and  Yeltsin shaking hands is the reason for the deepening of our  problems, it was said. This is not the case, of course.  Moreover, had there not been real support on the part of Russia,  the situation would possibly be considerably worse. Yes, we are  an industrial republic with giant enterprises. It is good when  these enterprises are operating continuously. When they are  standing idle, however, it is a disaster. Those who share it out  know that we are today receiving from the federal budget for  current expenditure more than we are paying in. For the spring  operations alone we obtained a soft loan of R60 billion. This is  almost 10 times more than our payments.    So I stress once again that much will depend on ourselves.  In  order to move forward we must have a precise program fine-tuned  in all respects. And perhaps not one but two or three radical  economic reform programs. It would be no great misfortune were  they to differ from one another fundamentally--we would fish out  what was rational. May these programs unite several groups of  authors--ours and "outsiders'." The latter should not be  dismissed, for great experience of the creation of various  programs has after all been accumulated in the country. It is  essential to speed up the birth of such a program, there is no  doubt about this. In the present economic situation, however, we  are putting the emphasis as yet only on measures of social  protection.    [Leksina] As we know, in the morning you visited Kazan's  markets. Fairs have been established there now. So, then, have  our  granaries not been depleted?    [Shaymiyev] No. The markets are well stocked. But it is  important, in addition, that there be consumer demand, and many  people's income has, unfortunately, declined. I spoke with very  many people on this occasion, for hours, about everything. About  the impending summer season, for example. The summer residents'  concern is understandable--will the fares on suburban routes be  reduced, as was the case last year and the year before. There  will be a 50 percent reduction on the buses. They asked that  thought be given to those who get to their country cottages by  river. We will give it some thought.    [Leksina] But there are the suburban electric trains....    [Shaymiyev] I had a special talk about these with Boris  Nikolayevich. It is a general problem. Thus it was decided to  cover from the federal budget the reduction in fares for the  summer period on suburban railroad transport. Only on weekends  and holidays, it is true.    [Leksina] You were gone from the republic for more than a  week. The reports in this time surely carried much that is new  from the spring fields?    [Shaymiyev] The pace of work is, on the whole, higher than  last year, and no particular surprises are anticipated, I  believe. It will be more difficult, perhaps, only for the areas  that had a protracted wet fall. The farms of the southeast of  the republic.    [Leksina] The final question, Mintimer Sharipovich. You were  taking part in the Federation Council for the first time. What  was your impression?    [Shaymiyev] I believe that it is as yet making inadequate  use  of its constitutional possibilities and that this chamber has  not yet (since December!) formed its own handwriting. Use needs  to be made of the council's legislative initiative for the  resolution of major strategic problems.    [Leksina] Thank you for the interview. We wish you a good  rest from the Moscow workload during the May Day holiday.</p>

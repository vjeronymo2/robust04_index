			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / ICI defends record on 'green' issues SIR DENYS Henderson, ICI chairman, yesterday defended his company's environmental record at an annual general meeting disrupted by supporters of Greenpeace, the environmental pressure group. Sir Denys said ICI, the UK's largest producer of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) which are blamed for depleting the earth's ozone layer, was committed to phasing out production as quickly as possible. He told shareholders that the group was encouraging customers to switch to alternatives such as Klea 134a. It had increased CFC recycling facilities, although they were not being used as extensively as had been hoped. And it supported a government initiative to identify the minimum quantity of CFCs required to meet essential UK needs. Greenpeace opposes the use of Klea 134a, a hydrochlorofluorocarbon, which it argues is also an ozone-depleting gas.</p>

			<p><P> July 10, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GANG IS SUSPECTED OF FIRING ON OFFICERS;  </P> <P> CRIME: ONE IS INJURED AS BULLET RICOCHETS OFF HIS PATROL CAR. RETALIATION FOR  THE DEATH OF A GANG MEMBER MAY BE THE MOTIVE.  </P> <P> A Los Angeles police officer was grazed by a gunshot outside a Wilmington  housing project over the weekend in apparent retaliation for the death hours  earlier of a gang member who was fleeing police, authorities said Monday.  </P> <P> Harbor Division Officer Don Linfield was only bruised in the Sunday morning  shooting, which is still under investigation. Police and community activists,  meanwhile, sought Monday to prevent further violence that might stem from the  death early Saturday of John Santos, 21, of Wilmington.  </P> <P> "Things could get out of hand if we don't do something quickly," said Dee  Wiggington, president of Mothers Against Gangs, a Wilmington community group  that planned an emergency meeting Monday night.  </P> <P> Linfield was wounded about 2 a.m. Sunday outside Dana Strand Village, a  384-unit housing project that was the scene about 24 hours earlier of the  incident that ended in Santos' death.  </P> <P> Authorities said Santos was walking through the housing project about 3 a.m.  Saturday when he saw officers on patrol and fled, apparently ingesting  narcotics as he ran. After running a short distance, Santos collapsed and began  choking, police said. The officers, who had chased him, used the Heimlich  maneuver in a vain attempt to clear the man's windpipe, police said.  </P> <P> A small group of bystanders demanded that officers use cardiopulmonary  resuscitation to revive Santos, police said. But the officers and an ambulance  attendant continued their efforts, insisting that it was useless to use CPR  while Santos' windpipe was blocked. The young man was finally taken by  ambulance to Kaiser Permanente Hospital in Harbor City, where he was pronounced  dead at 4:05 a.m.  </P> <P> Police said Monday it was unclear whether Santos died from choking or from  ingesting narcotics, believed to be cocaine. A coroner's spokesman said the  cause of death was tentatively listed as choking pending an autopsy.  </P> <P> Hours after Santos' death, police said, fellow gang members held a wake,  promised retaliation for his death and spray-painted death threats against  police on the housing project's walls.  </P> <P> Sunday morning, Linfield and his partner, Officer Pete Vasquez, were shot at as  they patrolled Dana Strand in their police car. A bullet ricocheted off the car  and struck Linfield, who was driving. A search failed to turn up the gunman,  police said.  </P> <P> "Gang members always make threats after one of their own is killed. But for  them to write on walls and then actually shoot at police is serious. They're  not playing games," Wiggington said.  </P> <P> Harbor Division Capt. Joe DeLadurantey said he hopes to meet today with Dana  Strand residents to explain that his officers did all they could to save  Santos. "We want to make sure that everyone understands the facts," he said.  </P></p>

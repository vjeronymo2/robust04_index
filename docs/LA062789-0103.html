Representatives of Eastern and the Air Line Pilots Assn. met with  David I. Shapiro, the court-appointed examiner overseeing the airline on behalf  of the federal bankruptcy court. The discussions, ordered late last week by  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland, are expected to continue through the  week.  </P></p>

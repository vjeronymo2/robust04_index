			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / Anger at Mercedes jobs threat EMPLOYEE representatives of Daimler-Benz, the German vehicle, aerospace, and electronics group, reacted angrily yesterday to a statement by Mr Edzard Reuter, the chief executive, that it had 20,000 workers too many on the car and truck side. Mr Reuter told journalists in Hamburg that the company's Mercedes-Benz vehicle subsidiary needed to slim down. 'We have roughly 20,000 employees too many on board and must lose some more fat.' Mercedes has said that it intends to reduce its workforce in coming years, but has never specified by how much. Mr Karl Feuerstein, the head of Daimler's works council, said yesterday that the board of Mercedes had declined to set out its reasoning behind the need for such a massive reduction of the workforce. Mercedes employs 237,000 people, of which 185,000 are in Germany. Car output, carried out solely in Germany, accounts for 99,000 of the total. Mr Feuerstein called on Mercedes to state exactly when and where it planned to implement job cuts. The works council also demanded that Mercedes start negotiations on early retirements. Like other car companies in Germany, Mercedes is trying to attack its high domestic cost base. BMW recently said it intended to reduce its workforce of 74,000 people by around 3,000 this year through non-replacement of those leaving and early retirement. Volume producers Volkswagen, Opel and Ford are also striving to curb production costs in the face of tougher foreign competition.</p>

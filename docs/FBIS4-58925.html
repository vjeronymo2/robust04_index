			<p>BFN     [Text] The first group from the al-Aqsa forces of the  Palestine Liberation Army stationed on Iraqi territory arrived  at the border post of al-Karamah-al-Ruwayshid this morning en  route to the occupied territories. This group is composed of  600 officers, non-commissioned officers, and other ranks.    Palestinian Ambassador in Amman al-Tayyib 'Abd-al-Rahim said  these forces' entry at the al-Ruwayshid border post came at the  request of the Palestinian leadership. His Majesty King Husayn  ordered that all necessary facilities be provided to these  forces during their stay on Jordanian territory, and that they  be treated as the guests of the Jordanian Armed Forces, which  will equip and arm them.    In a statement to the JORDANIAN NEWS AGENCY, the ambassador  added that both Jordan's permission for this group to enter  Jordanian territory and the provision of the necessary  assistance to them are definitive proof of the true and profound  fraternity between the sisterly Jordanian and Palestinian  peoples and their common fate. Moreover, this confirms the  eagerness of the Hashemite leadership, represented by His  Majesty King Husayn, to enable the sons of the Palestinian  people to achieve their national objectives on their national  soil under the leadership of the PLO.    This group was welcomed by representatives from the  Jordanian  Armed Forces and by the Palestinian military attache at the  Palestinian Embassy in Amman.    In another development, 'Abd-al-Rahim said the Palestinian  police forces' entry into Gaza and Jericho areas is linked to  the announcment of the formation of the Palestinian national  authority. The Palestinian leadership is continuing its meetings  in the Tunisian capital to officially form this authority, he  added.    The Palestinian ambassador attributed the delay in the  Palestinian police forces' entry into Gaza and Jericho areas  today to technical reasons linked to the Israeli procedures  concerning these forces' weapons. He explained that contacts  are continuing in this regard between the heads of the  Palestinian and Israeli negotiating delegations, Sha'th and  Shahaq.</p>

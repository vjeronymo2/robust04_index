			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / PM studies scheme for long-term jobless A SCHEME to provide temporary work for up to 250,000 of Britain's long-term unemployed is being studied by the government. The initiative would offer participants an allowance in addition to existing benefits. It could be compulsory for those who have been unemployed for a period not yet specified but probably 18 months or two years. Options are being studied by the prime minister's Number 10 policy unit with the assistance of Mrs Gillian Shephard, employment secretary. Long-term unemployment, which is defined as for one year or more, stands at a 4 1/2 -year high at just under 1m. Mr John Major, who is discussing domestic policy this weekend at Chequers, is concerned that unemployment could emerge as a serious political problem. In a recent interview, he said fear of unemployment was a brake on recovery. Mr Major's personal involvement is seen as critical to the success of a scheme requiring private sector employers to be persuaded to offer large numbers of temporary work places. He would need to take a lead in urging bodies such as the Confederation of British Industry, the major employers' organisation, to become involved. Any new scheme, which might be announced in the March budget, could involve about 250,000 people a year, which would be far more than the 30,000-place Employment Action, a two-year-old voluntary temporary work programme that has failed to attract a full complement of unemployed. That is why compulsion is one of the options being studied. It is unlikely the programme would begin before the end of the year. Critics may claim that the plan mirrors 'workfare' programmes in some US states, whereby claimants are required to work in order to receive benefit. Mr Peter Ashby, of Full Employment UK, an employment consultancy, said the scheme should be seen as 'a genuine move towards a new long-term safety net for the long-term unemployed'. The government wants to bind the long-term unemployed more closely into the world of work. Other measures to be introduced this year include requiring those unemployed for more than 12 months to attend week-long workshops to draw up 'personal action plans'.</p>

			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Brazil suffers setback in debt talks BRAZIL's initial proposal for the rescheduling of its Dollars 21bn-Dollars 22bn debt with the Paris Club group of creditor governments has been rejected in the first day of negotiations in Paris, writes Christina Lamb in Rio de Janeiro. However, Brazilian economy ministry officials yesterday remained confident that agreement would be reached this week. The Brazilian negotiating team, led by Mr Francisco Gros, the central bank governor, was working on a new proposal yesterday after German and Japanese representatives had refused to accept Brazil's original offer. The main sticking point is Brazil's insistence on including in the rescheduling, debt that was rescheduled in the last accord in 1988. Mr Gros said on Friday that this accord had created an excessive concentration of repayments over the next two years. Brazil's original proposal asked for the rescheduling of Dollars 13.5bn over 18 years. This includes Dollars 8.6bn in arrears and Dollars 4.9bn in payments due over the next two years as a result of the 1988 accord.</p>

In this way, the French Field Forces,  comprising the Mechanized Armored Corps (CBM) and the Rapid  Response Corps (FAR), would eventually have an extra division.    After stressing that, in his view, "an Army of 225,000  troops  would be an absolute minimum," Mr. Leotard stated that, as  things stood, there were two possible solutions for Army troop  numbers by 1997. From 1990 to 1993, numbers had fallen from  288,500 to 241,400 (enlisted soldiers and conscripts), a drop of  some 16.4 percent. The so-called Joxe plan, which has still not  been officially repealed, provided for this figure to fall to  225,000 by 1997.    Mr. Leotard explained to members of the military council  that  the options would be proposed by the government in due course in  the framework of the new military planing law for 1995-2000,  which will be put before Parliament in the spring of 1994.    The defense minister said: "One initial solution consists in  reducing Army troop numbers to 225,000 or 230,000, divided over  eight specific divisions providing the required range of  abilities. This would just be sufficient to prevent and manage  current short-term crises. The other solution in adapting the  Army would be to adopt the size and structures existing in 1994,  i.e., 240,000 soldiers in nine divisions." Mr. Leotard went on  to state: "The conclusions drawn from the work done in the  framework of the Defense white paper and the future military  planning law will lead to a final decision being made on this  issue."    This is the first time the defense minister has mentioned  the  possibility that the Joxe plan, which originally catered for the  constitution of eight divisions, might no longer be acceptable.  He thus echoed the claims made by the Army, whose General Staff  had carried out studies -- which until now had remained  relatively discreet -- in favor of the creation of a new  division for the French field forces.</p>

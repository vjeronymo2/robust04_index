			<p><P> February 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FAA AGENT IN CRASH PROBE CHANGES STAND, PRAISES USAIR PILOT TRAINING  </P> <P> A federal examiner who earlier had been critical of USAir on Wednesday told  investigators studying last September's crash of a USAir jetliner that the  airline has good training and certification programs for its pilots.  </P> <P> In his report to the National Transportation Safety Board in December, William  Dubis, leader of a Federal Aviation Administration team studying the airline,  had criticized some USAir training and proficiency-check programs as  "inconsistent," "lacking realism" and "degraded by an absence of challenge."  </P> <P> But, on Wednesday, in his testimony before an NTSB panel investigating the  crash, Dubis said that the airline is producing safe pilots and there is no  need for regulatory change.  </P> <P> Dubis told the panel that it is just a matter of USAir's changing training  techniques in a few areas, and "they're in the process of doing this at a rapid  pace."  </P> <P> Another FAA official, principal operations inspector James A. Rapucci,  testified that he also thought USAir has good training and pilot-evaluation  programs.  </P> <P> "USAir operates at a very high level of safety," Rapucci told the NTSB panel.  </P> <P> NTSB investigators have questioned whether pilot Michael Martin and co-pilot  Constantine Kleissas utilized appropriate cockpit procedures last Sept. 20  during an aborted takeoff attempt at La Guardia Airport.  </P> <P> The Boeing 737 jetliner skidded off the end of the runway and into the East  River, killing two of the 57 passengers.  </P> <P> On Dec. 15, Dubis submitted his report of a three-week FAA study of the  airline's training and certification programs, which include flight-proficiency  tests in simulators and actual aircraft.  </P> <P> The report complained that the training programs "are lacking in 'real world'  scenarios and result in non-thinking performance, where the ability of the  student to demonstrate a mastery of complex problems, good judgment,  situational awareness, cockpit management and leadership skills have all been  removed."  </P></p>

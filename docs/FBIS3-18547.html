			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The U.S. Officials"] </F>   [Text] Two U.S. officials, Robert Lamb, the U.S. State  Department special coordinator on the Cyprus issue, and U.S.  Undersecretary of State Steven (Oxman), are being sent to  Nicosia to help "rescue" the proximity talks. It is not known  how the two U.S. officials will try to help or whether they will  make any new proposals or plans to facilitate the talks that  have essentially come to a halt. If Lamb and (Oxman) are coming  to Nicosia merely to persuade us to agree to implement the  confidence-building measures [CBM's], we believe their mission  will be useless. The Greek Cypriot side will not accept  pressure or suggestions about the CBM's. It has repeatedly  raised its arguments, which foreigners have described as  reasonable and realistic! So our side has permanently closed  the door to further concessions on Famagusta's fenced-off area  and Nicosia Airport.    Every side believes next week should be decisive for future  developments, particularly the future of the proximity talks.  This is because, as Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary general's  alternate special representative in Cyprus, revealed, the UN  envoys will make some new suggestions. So we will wait to see  the new suggestions that are being prepared by the UN envoys in  Nicosia. UN circles implied that the new ideas "will break the  deadlock."    Developments in the Cyprus issue are expected in the third  and last phase of the proximity talks, which is believed to be  the last, the decisive one, for future developments. If the new  round of talks achieves no positive result because of the  Turkish side's insistence on its known positions, essentially,  to hold hostage those Greeks who return to Famagusta and acquire  "state" rights for Nicosia Airport, then the New York talks will  be useless. The chapter of the talks will close and we will  start preparing to get out of the deadlock created by the Turks,  which is tolerated by insincere foreigners.</p>

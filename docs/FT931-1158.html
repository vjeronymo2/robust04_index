			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Short-term truck rentals behind Dawsongroup leap INCREASING demand for short-term truck rental helped Dawsongroup, the commercial vehicle concern, to multiply pre-tax profits more than four times from Pounds 1.13m to Pounds 4.75m last year. Mr Peter Dawson, chairman and chief executive, said: 'In recession, a large number of vehicle operators have sought to defer capital investment and long-term commitments by turning to short-term rental.' The group invested Pounds 10.5m in new equipment for the short-term fleet. Sales rose from Pounds 43m to Pounds 46.7m. Rentals increased pre-tax profits from Pounds 982,000 to Pounds 4.2m on the back of new contracts from companies no longer interested in long-term contracts. The commercial vehicles division increased pre-tax profits from Pounds 144,000 to Pounds 534,000. Sales rose only marginally and a large part of the increase represented additional trucks sold to the group's rental division. Group operating profits rose from Pounds 6.26m to Pounds 8.99m. Net interest fell to Pounds 4.2m (Pounds 5.1m). Earnings per share increased to 10.4p (2.7p). The final dividend is raised to 2.25p for an increased total of 3p (1.5p).</p>

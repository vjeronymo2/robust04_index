In almost all local Caucasian conflicts  (Ossetia, Chechnya, Abkhazia, Adzharia, Imeretia, Lezgistan,  Karabakh etc.), Turkey supported one side with money and  weapons, and Russia the other.    In the latter half of the 1990's Iran (the third regional  great power) was too preoccupied with its war in southern Iraq  and with support of Shi-ite factions of Islamic mujahadin  fundamentalists opposing mujahadin Suni-ites in former Soviet  Central Asia, and it had neither the resources nor the political  will to participate seriously in the Caucasian wars. In  addition, Iran still depended on Russia for its supply of modern  weapons, which forced Iran to direct military-political  expansion more southward, into the Persian Gulf region, and  further in the direction of Israel, in order to avoid serious  collision of interests with Russia.    By the year 2000 the peacemaking enthusiasm of the early  1990's died away in Western Europe and the USA as a result of a  number of extremely unsuccessful long-distance military  expeditions. Following the ignominious evacuation from Mogadishu  and the heavy Anglo-French losses in the appalling cauldron of  Sarajevo (the new Dien Bien Phu), in 1994 France, Great Britain  and Germany reduced military expenditures and armed forces even  more. In accordance with the Maastricht agreements a Unified  European Army was created, intended for demonstration of  European unity but totally unsuited to the real war in the  hostile environment of the Caucasus Mountains.    The slump and inflation in the country and foreign policy  failures (Somali, Bosnia, Ukraine, Estonia, the Caucasus) led to  the dominance of American society by isolationist sentiments  almost as deep as those of the 1920's. In 1996, Ross Perot was  elected U.S. president under the slogan "America First."    The time of active intervention of the UN Security Council  in  regional conflicts (1990-1994) was over. In the Caucasus, Turkey  and Russia opposed one another, and there wasn't a third force  that could serve as a serious referee and somehow stabilize the  unstable bipolar confrontation.    In 1993-1995 the Armenian Army became ever stronger. It kept  Nagornyy Karabakh and contiguous regions of Azerbaijan under  dependable control. The government in Baku changed frequently,  and every government was weaker than the one preceding it.    An Armenian-Azeri peace treaty was signed in 1993, and  demilitarized zones under the supervision of the European  Community Security Council were established. The peace endured  through all of 1994 without serious violations.    In fall 1994 Lezgistan partisans intensified their combat  activities on the Azeri-Russian border. Rail communication  between Azerbaijan and Russia became totally unreliable. The  weak central government was incapable of safeguarding cargo and  maintaining at least some kind of order in other regions of  Azerbaijan. In Georgia, the central government controlled only  the Tbilisi vicinity. Armenia found itself in a blockade of  worse proportions than in 1992. In the unexpectedly cold winter  of 1994-1995 people in Yerevan died not so much from outright  starvation (international humanitarian aid was delivered via an  air bridge) as from cold.    In spring 1995 tens of thousands of irate demonstrators led  by activists from the Dashnak Party seized the parliament  building. The parliament deposed President Ter-Petrosyan in the  face of assault rifle muzzles, after which it announced its own  self-dissolution. The victorious opposition formed a new  government. The Armenian Army began a decisive offensive to  break the blockade and to establish a friendly regime in Baku,  with which a peace could be signed.    It became clear in Ankara that in a few days Azerbaijan was  going to become an Armenian-Russian protectorate. Turkey  demanded immediate cessation of Armenian aggression, but the  ultimatum was ignored in Yerevan, where it was declared that  "the combat activities are being pursued not by the Armenian  Army but by self-defense forces of the independent Karabakh  Republic." Then occurred the inevitable--the Turkish Army  intervened directly into the war. At first, subunits of the  Turkish forces were transferred to the Nakhichevan enclave. And  then, in May 1995, tanks of the IX Army Corps of the 3d Field  Army began an offensive from the vicinity of Kars with the  support of combat aviation.   <FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-004C-04A>           P. Felgengauer's War With Turkey (1995-2000) </FIG>       Almost immediately Russian motorized rifle and armored  forces  located at the Turkish-Armenian border in the vicinity of Gyumri  entered into combat, but they had almost no air cover, because  the nearest Russian air bases were hundreds of kilometers away  in the Northern Caucasus. Turkish aviation dominated the skies  over the battlefield. Joint defense by the Armenians and  Russians was hacked to pieces in 48 hours. Russian forces  withdrew to the north, to the Georgian border, while Turkish  tanks turned to the south, toward Yerevan. Armenian forces  offered fierce resistance, but it was clear that the city would  be taken in a few days.    At this time mobile formations of the Russian Army were  participating in peacemaking operations in Central Asia, in  northeastern Estonia, in some oblasts of eastern Ukraine, in the  Crimea, and in the Northern Caucasus.    The Russian Army had no reserves to draw from to stop the  Turkish offensive. But Moscow couldn't cede the Transcaucasus to  Turkey, because this would have destabilized the Northern  Caucasus totally. It was believed in Moscow that a victory in  Armenia would result in further penetration by Turks into  Turkic-language Central Asia, and that it would fortify the  positions of extreme nationalists in Ukraine. Moscow felt a  mortal threat, and decided upon extreme measures.    Russian frontal Su-24 Fencer bombers made a number of bomb  strikes on bases and airfields of the Turkish 3d Army, but they  suffered losses. Russian strategic bombers flying over the Black  Sea launched several dozen cruise missiles carrying conventional  warheads against a number of objectives in the vicinity of  Bosporus, as well as in Ankara, the capital of Turkey. Eighty  percent of the missiles struck their targets precisely, but the  Turkish invasion of Armenia continued. In addition, Turkey  closed the Strait of Bosporus to Russian merchant vessels. The  Russian Supreme Military Council announced an ultimatum to  Turkey: To cease the offensive in 24 hours and begin an  immediate troop withdrawal, or "Russia would use all means at  its disposal to stop the aggression." Turkey said that it would  not yield to nuclear blackmail, obviously figuring that Russia  would never opt for nuclear weapons against a nonnuclear power  that was also member of NATO. In the meantime, Turkish tanks had  encircled Yerevan and were fighting in the southern suburbs.    Then President General ***, chairman of the Russian Supreme  Military Council, decided to make a preemptory demonstrative  nuclear strike on Turkey. A radar station in the vicinity of  Kars was targeted. The 100 kiloton air burst, after which there  was no noticeable radioactive fallout, destroyed the station.  The civilian population practically didn't suffer. Of course,  three American servicemen observing the course of the conflict  were located at the station at the moment of the nuclear strike.    However, Washington's reaction was sluggish. No one wanted  to  begin a world nuclear war because of some half-destroyed  villages in the Caucasus Mountains. And especially the weak and  unpopular Clinton administration. The world community as a whole  did not react to the war in the Transcaucasus in any serious  way. That is, there were many midnight emergency meetings in New  York, Brussels, Washington, Paris and London, but no real  actions were taken either during the Armenian offensive or  during the Turkish offensive, or after the first nuclear strike  since 1945. Only pro-Turkish and anti-Turkish demonstrations in  Germany led to new outbreaks of violence: Dormitories were  torched, and stores were looted. The Russian president general  announced that another, more powerful nuclear strike would be  made on Turkey in 24 hours. But as a result of many hours of  negotiations via the "hot line," a joint Russian-American  settlement was developed that Turkey would have to accept. The  Armenian forces were once again withdrawn from Azeri territory,  while Turkish forces drew back from Armenian territory. However,  Karabakh remained under Armenian control, and Nakhichevan under  Turkish control.    With Russia's help Armenia soon replenished its losses in  armaments, and continued to build up its military potential,  gradually transforming into an enclave armed to the teeth--a  "new Israel," with which the Armenians like to compare their  tiny war-ready country. Azerbaijan and Georgia disintegrated  into zones controlled by different local field commanders, some  of whom were pro-Turkey, while others were pro-Moscow. (By the  way, most simply plundered everything that others hadn't yet  managed to take).    In Turkey, the "National Unity" government, allied with  Muslim fundamentalists and extreme nationalists, came into  power. Turkey drifted ever further away from the West, all the  more so because its entry into the European Community was  blocked insurmountably by Greece. Using pro-Turkish field  commanders in Azerbaijan and Georgia, Ankara supported  anti-Russian partisan actions by mujahadin in the Islamic  Mountain Republic in the Northern Caucasus.    But by the year 2000 the situation began to change  fundamentally. Russia and its army were clearly emerging from  the crisis. Elite mobile brigades and regiments of helicopter  gunships were transferred to the Caucasus. The last centers of  organized resistance in Chechnya were suppressed. It was  becoming increasingly more obvious that the Russian peacemaking  army was preparing, as in 1921, to conduct a lightning campaign  in the Transcaucasus, and to annex republics exhausted by a  10-year war to the "Union"--the Unified Russian Federation. All  the more so because by this time 80 percent of the territory of  the former USSR was already pacified, and the Transcaucasus was  the last major center of instability.    In 2000 the main problem absorbing the analysts was whether  Turkey would be satisfied with the annexation of Nakhichevan,  and would recognize all of the rest of the former Soviet  Transcaucasus to be a zone of Russian interests, or decide upon  a new war the moment mobile forces of the Federation landed in  Baku. In the meantime, secret negotiations were proceeding  between Moscow and Ankara. In the year 2000 Russia was clearly  stronger than in 1995. It was hoped in Moscow that this time  Turkey would be more sensible. Of course after the humiliation  of 1995 the national fundamentalist government of Turkey  embarked upon accelerated creation of its own nuclear weapons,  but in the year 2000 the Muslim bomb was not yet ready. The  Caucasian War did prove one thing, by the way: Local wars were  going to be local nuclear wars more often in the 21st century.</p>

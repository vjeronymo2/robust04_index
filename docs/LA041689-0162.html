			<p><P> April 16, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> 2 HELD IN SHOOTING DEATH OF FRIEND  </P> <P> A man and a woman who went with a friend to collect a debt in Studio City were  in custody Saturday on suspicion of murder after their friend was fatally shot,  police said.  </P> <P> David Betancur, 26, of Sepulveda and Kelly Ann Poglitsch, 19, of Sylmar were  being held without bail, although police said neither fired the shot that  killed their 43-year-old companion.  </P> <P> Police said the dead man, whose name was withheld, apparently was shot in  self-defense on Friday by William Taylor, 41, after the victim used the butt of  a semiautomatic assault rifle to smash his way into Taylor's home in the 4500  block of Simpson Avenue.  </P> <P> Betancur and Poglitsch were arrested at the scene about 6 p.m. Friday, and were  being held without bail on suspicion of murder pending arraignment early this  week, police said.  </P> <P> Lt. John McCrillis said when a death occurs during the commission of a crime,  those involved in the crime can be charged with murder even if they "didn't  necessarily do the shooting."  </P> <P> Betancur, Poglitsch and the victim had gone to Taylor's house late Friday  afternoon, apparently because of a dispute over a vehicle and money the victim  claimed Taylor owed him.  </P> <P> Police said Taylor and his girlfriend, Sheri Herman, 42, were watching  television when Herman heard a vehicle pull up in front of the house. Looking  out the window, she saw an acquaintance running through the yard to the back of  the house clutching an assault rifle.  </P> <P> Taylor retreated to a rear bedroom and returned with a 12-gauge shotgun.  </P> <P> Police said the victim broke the glass in French doors at the rear of the  house. Police said Taylor, believing he and Herman were about to be killed,  fired a single round into the attacker's upper torso.  </P> <P> Police said Taylor and Herman ran to a neighbor's house to wait for police.  Betancur and Poglitsch were arrested without incident a short time later.  </P></p>

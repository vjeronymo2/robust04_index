Gao Dezhan, secretary of the municipal  party committee, gave an important speech at the opening  ceremony of these two conferences. He emphasized: Leaders at  all levels and comrades on the propaganda work front and  organizational work front in Tianjin should have a clearer  understanding of the overall interest of the work of the entire  party, subordinate to and serve this overall interest, raise  spirit, work in a down-to-earth manner, open up a new situation  in propaganda and ideological work and in organizational work,  and provide an effective ideological guarantee and  organizational guarantee for Tianjin's reform, opening up, and  modernization drive.    Gao Dezhan's speech consisted of three parts: 1) The issue  on clearly understanding the overall interest of the work of the  entire party and thoroughly implementing the guidelines of the  second enlarged plenary session of the sixth municipal party  committee, 2) The issue on conscientiously implementing the  guidelines of the national propaganda and ideological work  conference and strengthening and improving propaganda and  ideological work, and 3) The issue on conscientiously  implementing the guidelines of the national forum of directors  of organization departments and further strengthening  organizational work.    Li Jianguo, deputy secretary of the municipal party  committee, presided over the conferences.    The major guidelines of the national propaganda and  ideological work conference and the national forum of directors  of organization departments were relayed.    Attending were municipal leading comrades Li Shenglin, Yang  Zhihua, Fang Fengyou, Song Pingshun, Luo Yuanpeng, Zheng  Zhiying, Wang Hongjiang, and Zhang Guanwen.    Gao Dezhan said in his speech: At the national propaganda  and ideological work conference, Comrade Jiang Zemin gave  profound expositions on the basic principles for the work of the  entire party for this year and the overall interest of the work.  We must earnestly study and profoundly understand them and make  propaganda and ideological work, organizational work, and the  work in various fields of the party subordinate to and serve the  endeavor of "seizing the opportunity to deepen reform, open  wider to the outside world, promote development, and maintain  stability," which meets the overall interest. The guidelines of  the second enlarged plenary session of the sixth municipal party  committee are totally in conformity to the principles for the  work of the entire party and the overall interest of the work as  defined by the party Central Committee. We should  conscientiously implement the arrangements of the party Central  Committee and, focusing on the overall interest of the work of  the entire party, implement more thoroughly the guidelines of  the second enlarged plenary session of the sixth municipal party  committee and comprehensively fulfill all the targets and tasks  as put forward in the major points of the municipal party  committee's 1994 work.    Gao Dezhan said: Since the second enlarged plenary session  of the sixth municipal party committee, all departments,  committees, offices, districts, counties, and bureaus have  conscientiously relayed and implemented the guidelines of the  session, stepped up efforts to start up work, and carried out in  a down-to-earth manner. They had a fairly good beginning and a  very good development trend. However, this was only a beginning,  and the development in different localities and departments was  also uneven. Thus the tasks remain very arduous to fulfill the  work targets put forward by the municipal party committee. To  make this year's work successful, we should continue to pay  attention to the following key areas from ideological  understanding to specific practice and continue to raise our  leadership level and work level. First, we should firmly  embrace the awareness of opportunity and the awareness of  development and further enhance the sense of urgency and  responsibility. Second, we should fully understand that reform  and opening up are the motivation and the basic way of  development and firmly embrace the idea of relying on reform to  promote development.    Third, we should persistently take economic construction as  the central task, muster efforts to promote the economy, and  maintain the sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development.  We should attach importance not only to the increase in the  total supply and total demand, but we should also attach  importance to the improvement of the quality of economic  development. In developing the economy, we should have new  ideas and should devote great efforts to and achieve major  breakthroughs in adjusting the structure, strengthening  management, achieving technological advance, ending deficits and  increasing profits, raising efficiency, and improving the  quality of staff members and workers. Fourth, we should have a  good command of the relationship between reform, development,  and stability. Fifth, we should persistently take the "three  advantages" as the basic criterion for judging all work, strive  to develop social productive forces, enhance the economic  strength, and upgrade people's living standard. We should keep  the interests of the masses in mind, do everything for them,  rely on them in doing work, and exert utmost efforts to seek  benefits and do practical work for them. Sixth, we should  persistently "attend to two tasks and be competent in both."  Economic construction should be promoted to a new height, and so  should the spiritual civilization. We should strengthen  propaganda and ideological work; strengthen democracy and the  legal system; step up efforts to comprehensively improve public  security; actively develop all social undertakings; promote  overall social progress; and make sure that economic and social  undertakings develop in a coordinated manner.    Gao Dezhan said: The general demand on Tianjin's propaganda  and ideological work for this year is to conscientiously  implement the guidelines of the important speeches delivered by  Jiang Zemin and other central leading comrades at the national  propaganda and ideological work conference, take Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics as the basic guide, arm the people with  scientific theories, guide them with correct public opinion,  mold them with noble spirit, encourage them with outstanding  works, provide an effective ideological guarantee and a good  media environment for accelerating the establishment of the  socialist market economy system, facilitating sustained, rapid,  and healthy economic development, safeguarding social stability,  and promoting overall social progress, and mobilize, unite, and  encourage party members and the masses more successfully to  advance Tianjin's reform, opening up, and modernization drive.  Gao Dezhan said: In the great cause of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics, propaganda and ideological work  shoulders great missions and has a direct bearing on the overall  situation of the modernization drive. Leading cadres at all  levels should enhance ideological understanding and have more  initiative and stronger sense of responsibility in making  propaganda and ideological work successful. In the new  situation, this work merits more attention and should never be  neglected; and it should only be greatly strengthened and  improved and never be weakened or become stagnant.    Gao Dezhan emphasized: In compliance with the requirements  put forward in Comrade Jiang Zemin's important speech, the  propaganda and ideological front should persistently take  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics as the basic guide and strive to achieve  success in the four aspects of work. First, it should  thoroughly study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory and use this  theory to arm the minds of the vast number of party members,  cadres, and the masses. This is the most important task for the  propaganda and ideological front. The propaganda and  ideological front should continue to intensify the study of  Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping,  exert more efforts to read it in the origin, master its essence,  integrate theory with practice, and unify thinking to guide  work. It should further intensify theoretical propaganda and  theoretical study. Second, it should persist in the correct  media guidance and do a better job in the propaganda by the  media. In carrying out propaganda and media work, it should  adhere to the party's basic line, unswervingly maintain  political unity with the party Central Committee, uphold the  principle of unity, stability, encouragement, and propaganda  through positive examples, and make sure that the political  orientation is firm and correct, the propaganda style is healthy  and progressive, sensitive issues are properly handled, and a  good media environment is created for reform, development and  stability.    Third, it should intensify ideological and moral education  and carry out the activities to build the spiritual civilization  in a down-to-earth manner. Fourth, it should greatly advocate  the main melody, make culture and art flourish, and strive to  provide more and better nourishment for the minds of the masses.  He pointed out: Party committees at all levels should attach  great importance to propaganda and ideological work,  conscientiously hold the responsibility for it, truly place it  high on their agenda, and comprehensively strengthen leadership  over it. They should enforce strict system of responsibility  for work targets, make earnest efforts to attain them, and pay  close attention to and make conscientious efforts in all the  work of the propaganda and ideological front.    Speaking on further strengthening organizational work, Gao  Dezhan said: The tasks of the organizational work for this year  are very heavy. The general demand is to take Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics and the party's basic line as the guide and,  proceeding from the overall interest of the work of the entire  party, strive to meet the needs of the new situation, achieve  success in party building, step up efforts to improve leading  bodies at all levels, strengthen and improve grass- roots party  organizations and the education and management of party members,  and provide an organizational guarantee for deepening reform,  opening wider to the outside world, promoting development,  maintaining stability, and facilitating overall social progress.  This year, we should take party building as key work, persist in  the practice of making the party take charge of party affairs,  and run the party strictly. Party organizations at all levels  should concentrate effort on party building and devote more  efforts to it. They should focus on the economy to promote party  building, promote the economy by making party building  successful, and achieve notable results in improving ideology,  organization, and work styles. In strengthening party building,  we should particularly achieve success in improving leading  bodies at all levels; win greater results in improving their  ideology and work styles; make a great step forward in the  system whereby cadres can be promoted and demoted as required  and in the exchange of cadres, the training and promotion of  outstanding young cadres, and the education, theoretical study,  and vocational training of cadres; and open up a new situation  in the organizational work. In his speech, Gao Dezhan put  forward clear demands on the endeavors to improve the ideology,  work styles, and organization of leading bodies at all levels,  greatly train and promote outstanding young cadres, and make the  party's grass-roots organizations still better.    In conclusion, Gao Dezhan said: Propaganda and ideological  work and organizational work are important work concerning the  overall situation, and they play a very important role in the  party's attainment of all tasks. The propaganda and ideological  front and the organizational work front bear heavy  responsibilities, and the municipal party committee places great  expectations on them. It is hoped that party committees at all  levels will conscientiously implement the guidelines of the  national propaganda and ideological work conference and the  national forum of directors of organization departments and, in  line with the arrangements of the second enlarged plenary  session of the sixth municipal party committee, adopt effective  measures to make propaganda and ideological work and  organizational work still more successful, create a new  situation, and make still greater contributions.    Attending the conferences were major party and government  responsible comrades, comrades in charge of propaganda and  ideological work and organizational work, directors of  propaganda and organization departments, and responsible  comrades of all the units of propaganda departments, totaling  more than 1,200 persons.</p>

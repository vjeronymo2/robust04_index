			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Gatt deal may enrich world by Dollars 270bn A GATT agreement could enrich the world by as much as Dollars 270bn (Pounds 178.8bn) by the year 2002, according to a study published by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development yesterday. This is the highest estimate yet of the overall benefits that could flow from a successful conclusion of the seven-year Uruguay Round negotiations. It is larger than the Dollars 213bn welfare gain estimated in a joint OECD-World Bank study in September because it calculates gains from cuts in non-tariff as well as tariff barriers in industrial goods trade. Presenting the report, Mr Jean-Claude Paye, the OECD secretary general, said: 'I would not bet on this figure (Dollars 270bn), but the important thing is that all (economic) models lead to the same conclusion that a Gatt accord would be a substantial net benefit to world welfare.' The OECD study was launched on Canada's initiative, with strong backing coming from some other Anglo-Saxon countries and reluctant acquiescence from France. Meanwhile, France's prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur, said he had no faith in claims that mere signature of a Gatt accord would relaunch the world economy, or in 'fantasy growth figures, which some people promise us', or in fear that a Uruguay Round failure would make world trade any more problematic than it had been in the past seven years. He also confessed alarm at the current North American Free Trade Agreement debate in the US, in which some Americans were demanding further reinforcement of their country's means of unilateral commercial retaliation. The French premier told a conference in Paris he expected Europe's partners to make 'the leap' necessary to unblock the negotiations before the end of this year. Mr Balladur refrained from dismissing, as many of his ministers do, the December 15 deadline for the Uruguay Round as an American date set only for the convenience of the US Congress. He now appears to regard that deadline as real. Mr Peter Sutherland, the Gatt director general, said that Gatt's participants faced a clear choice. 'They can either update and strengthen the multilateral system, or they can stand by and watch the centrifugal forces of economic nationalism tear it apart, and their future along with it,' he said. The Gatt director did not believe any government would be 'so perverse, so blind to its own interests, as to set out deliberately to destroy the Uruguay Round'. But it would only take 'a little more delay and indecision to produce exactly the same result'. Andrew Hill adds from Brussels: A high-level Commonwealth trade mission yesterday issued a strong warning to the US, EC and Japan not to endanger a world trade deal by delaying a conclusion or re-opening issues which had already been settled. Ministers from four Commonwealth countries spoke to Sir Leon Brittan, the EC's chief trade negotiator, on the second day of an eight-day mission. They told journalists after the meeting that they were increasingly optimistic the Round could be concluded before the December 15 deadline.</p>

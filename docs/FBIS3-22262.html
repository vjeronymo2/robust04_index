			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Greg Arde] </F>   [Text] Durban Feb 21 SAPA -- Demonstrators picketed outside  the Cato Ridge factory Thor Chemicals on Monday in protest  against the importation of a shipment of toxic waste bound for  the plant, halfway between Pietermaritzburg and Durban. It also  emerged on Monday that public pressure had forced the company to  stop all activities and business related to mercury. The first  practical implementation of this decision means the import will  be returned.    The shipment, which was on Monday afternoon en route to  Durban harbour from the United States, contains more than seven  tons of activated carbon containing five percent toxic mercuric  chloride.    Weekend reports said the ship would be turned back after the  American chemical company expressed concern about thor after  recent events at the Natal plant. Criminal charges are pending  after a Thor worker died of mercury poisoning.    In spite of protests the cargo would be landed in Durban  because, according to carrier Safmarine, all documentation for  the load indicated it was activated carbon and no more hazardous  than charcoal.    But environmentalists Earthlife Africa, in cooperation with  Greenpeace, trade unions and the African National Congress  reportedly arranged with the American exporter to have the  shipment returned.    Safmarine spokesman Richard Warnes said on Monday afternoon  that regardless of reports there had been no orders to stop the  shipment. He said Safmarine viewed the matter seriously ``but at  this stage there is nothing we can do. It is legally  inappropriate for us to stop the process.''    The company could not open the cargo to test it because this  might increase the environmental risk if it was toxic. Safmarine  was committed to the environment and would not do anything to  endanger it. He said the position might change before the ship  docked on Tuesday.    Earthlife Africa activist Mandy Jackson said she and eight  others demonstrated outside Thor Chemicals to protest against  the company's incineration of toxic waste.    Thor is claimed to have accepted three imports of 7,500 kg  of  toxic waste, which Ms. Jackson said still had to be disposed of.  Thor was urged to return the chemicals to sender, she said.    Ms. Jackson said she had heard that Thor had agreed on  Monday  to stop importing toxic waste after a joint tour of its plant by  an ANC environmental mission and the Environmental Justice  Network Forum. A Thor spokesman confirmed this, saying: ``We  won't receive it (the new shipment) and arrangements are being  made for it to be returned.'' In ``all probability'' there would  not be further imports, he said.    ``There has been so much pressure, it takes up too much of  our time and it means problems with the staff,'' the spokesman  said, adding that business related to mercury constituted about  20 percent of Thor's activities and would be discontinued.</p>

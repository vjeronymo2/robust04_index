At a press conference held on  10 January, Shigeru Hatakeyama, administrative vice minister for  the DA, commented on a plan to review the "outline" of the  defense plan. He stressed the importance of the DA's  fundamental policy, saying that as in the past the DA will map  out a new defense concept by next fall, and the new concept will  be reflected in DA budgets beginning in fiscal 1996 following  completion of the mid-term defense plan. Prime Minister Horihiro  Hosokawa explained his intention to incorporate a new outline  into the budget for fiscal 1995 by reviewing the current  "outline" this summer, one year earlier than originally  scheduled. Hatakeyama's remark is tantamount to sabotaging the  prime minister's plan.    Touching on the issue of reviewing the "outline," Hatakeyama  said on 10 January: "The DA is making preparations to map out  the rough structure of a new defense concept by the end of  fiscal 1994." Moreover, he commented on the possibility of  forming a project team within the DA for reviewing the  "outline," saying "we will do that one of these days." Thus he  emphasized a prearranged plan to study the possibility of  forming a DA study team apart from the advisory organ to the  prime minister.    As for ironing out differences between the Mid-Term Defense  Buildup Plan for 1991-1995 and a new Defense Buildup Plan,  Hatakeyama said: "It is said the advisory organ to the prime  minister will begin directing its plan by this summer. But it  is impossible to predict what will happen to the Mid-Term  Defense Buildup Plan unless you know its conclusion."    Among other things, the prime minister said at a news  conference on 4 January: "The world is moving towards detente.  The time is ripe for Japan to review its ideal defense  capability." The DA is not quite agreeing with the prime  minister because it is unable to satisfy its concern that the  prime minister may easily review the "outline" and trim the  defense budget for fiscal 1995. At the same time, it is  uncertain as to what degree the prime minister will review the  "outline." The DA also wants to take the lead in reviewing the  defense capability level and other matters in lieu of the  advisory organ to the prime minister. Therefore, it seems a  process of coordination between the Prime Minister's Office and  the DA will become harder than before.</p>

			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / International Capital Markets: Brazil woodpulp producer plans ADR ARACRUZ Celulose, Brazil's leading woodpulp producer, is planning an international share issue on the New York Stock Exchange to raise between Dollars 100m and Dollars 150m in the form of American Depository Receipts. Mr Mauro Molchansky, the company's financial director, said: 'We would like to open a window on the international markets to finance projects for the next decade and amortise some of our debt.' Aracruz has, like other Brazilian companies, been hit by the country's low standing in the international financial community for its non-payment of debt, limiting sources of external financing and forcing companies to find more imaginative avenues. Mr Molchansky said that of Aracruz's total Dollars 727m debt, Dollars 222m is short-term which the company would like to convert to longer-term borrowing or amortise through equity swaps. Salomon Brothers of the US will act as underwriter to the issue. He added that Aracruz will be ready to trade its stock internationally by December.</p>

			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / International Company News: Woolworths on course in Australia Woolworths, the large Australian retailer which floated on the stock market last year, said yesterday that it was on course to meet its prospectus forecast of ADollars 188.5m (USDollars 131m) after tax in the year to June 26, writes Nikki Tait. The reconfirmed forecast, still subject to the results of the annual stocktake, came as the group reported sales of ADollars 6.1bn for the first half of the financial year, encompassing the important Christmas period. This compared with sales of ADollars 5.48bn in the same period of the previous year. Woolworths said that 'like-for-like' store sales increased by 11.2 per cent, with each trading group with the company posting sales improvement well in excess of the 2 per cent inflation rate. It added that it saw some signs of 'sustainable economic recovery which bode well for the remaining 24 weeks of our financial year'. Despite Australia's high unemployment levels, most big retailers are understood to have had a fairly comfortable Christmas, suggesting that consumer confidence among the nation's shoppers is finally picking up.</p>

			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / International Company News: Cost-cutting helps Unisys to move ahead UNISYS, the US computer and electronics group, lifted earnings in its third quarter in spite of a decline in revenues blamed on currency exchange rates and weak sales in Europe and Japan. Net income for the quarter was Dollars 84.1m, or 29 cents a share, compared with Dollars 68.3m, or 23 cents, in the same period last year. Excluding the positive effects of tax items in each year, earnings per share in the quarter were 20 cents, against 17 cents a year ago. Revenue dipped to Dollars 1.81bn from Dollars 2.07bn in the third quarter last year. About 35 per cent of the decline was due to the impact of negative currency translation, the company said. Mr James Unruh, chairman and chief executive, said cost reductions in the last two years had produced continued improvement during an extended period of global economic weakness. 'We are confident that investments being made in new services and products, together with the new organisation structure announced in August will, over time, result in the generation of profitable revenue growth,' he said. 'Deterioration in our European business accelerated in the quarter, and Japan continues to be weak, offsetting growth in other parts of our business,' said Mr Unruh. He said the company would 'continue to reduce costs during this period of economic weakness'. For the nine-month period, net income was Dollars 447.7m, or Dollars 1.83, including a net gain of Dollars 203.8m, or 83 cents a share, from one-time items in the first quarter. Last year net income was Dollars 222m, or 79 cents, including Dollars 27m, or 16 cents, from tax benefits. Revenue was Dollars 5.64bn, compared with Dollars 6.17bn.</p>

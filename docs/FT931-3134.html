			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / Brother's attacks pull the plug on Collor's election ambitions ATTEMPTS by Brazil's former President Fernando Collor to recover his rights to stand as a candidate in next year's elections are being thwarted by a flood of fortune-seeking books by his vengeful younger brother and former aides about the torrid world of drugs, adultery and black magic that allegedly marked his presidency. With the Supreme Court due to decide within two weeks whether to proceed with criminal charges against the former president, removed in impeachment proceedings over corruption charges, Mr Collor's last shreds of honour are being stripped away by the revelations now rocking Brazil in the latest episode in the Cain and Abel saga between the two Collor brothers. Mr Collor has pleaded for people to ignore the damning extracts being published in the Jornal do Brasil from a book by his brother Pedro whose denunciations last year led to the president's downfall. A handwritten letter from Mr Collor to the media accused his brother of being 'sick in body and soul,' adding: 'Isn't it enough that they have taken away my political rights, my happiness, my peace. . . for the love of God, stop this]' There is very little that Pedro does not accuse his brother of in his book which he says 'will make the whole world question how such a person could become president of Brazil.' In the first two extracts alone he claims that while in office the president and his wife Rosane were cheating on each other - both with men - and that Rosane blackmailed Mr Collor by threatening to reveal his alleged cocaine addiction and wife-battering tendencies. Pedro goes on to detail black magic sessions by the first couple and Rosane's mother in which they jabbed pins into models of their enemies. Pedro also claims the presidential couple sacrificed goats and chickens and danced round them in daily ceremonies to try to ward off impeachment. Pedro's book is not the only one doing the rounds. In 'A Thousand Days of Solitude' by Mr Claudio Humberto, Mr Collor's loyal ex-spokesman, Pedro is the mentally imbalanced villain who shoots at the refrigerator when he cannot find the cheese. Although Pedro is not regarded as the most credible source, any hope of Mr Collor's imminent return to public life is likely to be dashed by the revelations which have led news items throughout Latin America.</p>

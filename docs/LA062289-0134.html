			<p><P> June 22, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TORRANCE ORDERS ZONING STUDY  </P> <P> The Torrance City Council has voted 4 to 3 to study how adjoining neighborhoods  would be affected by rezoning the former Columbia School site for residential  housing.  </P> <P> The study by the Planning Department will consider the effects of rezoning the  land for low- and medium-density residential uses, a senior housing project or  a specific plan development. The study will go to the Planning Commission,  which is likely to recommend a zone change to the council by August, city  officials said. The council decides zoning issues.  </P> <P> The five-acre lot on 186th Street, which is owned by the school and zoned for  public use, has been the subject of several hearings by various city agencies  and the Torrance Unified School District. School officials have said they want  to build apartments or other high-density residential developments on the site.  City Council members have expressed concern about the density of the project  and the possibility it might include subsidized housing.  </P> <P> Nearby residents have expressed a preference for low- or medium-density  housing.  </P> <P> Councilmen Bill Applegate and Dan Walker voted against the study, saying the  council does not need further study to decide how to rezone the land.  </P> <P> "I see this as a delay," Applegate said. "We've been studying this thing to  death." Councilman Tim Mock also voted against the study.  </P> <P> School district officials could not be reached for comment.  </P></p>

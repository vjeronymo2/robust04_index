			<p>Language: <F P=105> Macedonian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by S. Jovanovska: "Greek List of Wishes"] </F>   [Text] In agreement with the folk proverb "The hungry  dream of full plates," our neighbor, Greece, is once again  sending us dramatic announcements. These range from the  announcement that this week will be conclusive for the  Macedonian-Greek negotiations, that mediator Vance has already  prepared a memorandum that Skopje and Athens have to support,  that Delors and Van den Broek have prepared their "formulas" for  solving the crisis after the Greek closure of the borders, that  the European mediator will again visit Macedonia [The Former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], to a possible meeting  between Papoulias and Crvenkovski in Brussels or Geneva.    According to what we could learn from reliable Macedonian  sources, nothing can be expected from all these dramatic  announcements. That is to say, there is no Vance memorandum and  Macedonia has not been informed of it, and even laymen can be  assured by reading between the lines that it is comparable to a  Greek list of wishes and another testing "balloon" for us and  the European Union. According to the mentioned memorandum,  Macedonia should agree to withdraw the symbols [Star of Vergina  on FYROM flag], alter the Constitution where it deals with care  for the minorities abroad, and guarantee the borders -- all as a  precondition for placing the name issue under international  arbitration. This had no chance hitherto, and the Macedonian  side was never asked directly to do that. In return, Greece  should lift the embargo and the "veto" from the Conference on  Security and Cooperation in Europe, from the European Union, and  NATO, to which Macedonia is waiting to be admitted. Also, some  other benefits could be allotted to it [Macedonia] if it  fulfills some of the conditions that are not so dramatic for us,  and that were not acceptable when recognition of this state was  at stake. However, NATO is present in Macedonia with the  presence of the U.S. troops, and all European countries can give  the country their help separately, and not as members of the  Union (some have already done that), and the Republic is already  present in the CSCE, regardless of the status it has been given.    According to all this, all the drama has but one goal -- to  return the Macedonian-Greek dispute to the European Union, and  instead of reviewing the closure of the borders as a legal  problem (which it really is), it is adding a political dimension  to it, because the main defense of official Athens is based on  this trump, contained in the two articles of the Maastricht  agreement. That is, in the case of a threat to the stability of  this region, it is possible to close the borders with a  particular neighboring country, although it says "in  consultation with other EU countries." The way matters are now,  it is evident that these efforts are not echoed in Brussels,  where the closure of the borders is seen as an internal question  and as a violation of the regulations signed by all the member  states, starting from those on free trade and the transfer of  services, up to the fact that the Greek border also represents a  EU border.    All this speaks in favor of the announcement that this week  will really be conclusive, but for Greece, which could  definitely be put on the agenda of the European Justice Court.  What we are particularly interested in is the possible, though  not yet scheduled, meeting between Foreign Minister Stevo  Crvenkovski and Cyrus Vance in Geneva, after he has met and  talked to Greek Foreign Minister Carolos Papoulias. It is also  sure that our position will remain the same, and it means that  we are constantly ready to talk about all disputed questions --  "a basket" that has already been offered a few times so far, in  which there is no "item" on the change of the name of Macedonia,  regardless of how much Greece wants it and of what it is capable  of doing to achieve it.</p>

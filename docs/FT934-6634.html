			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Psychologists list Budget desires Psychologists yesterday added their voice to the clamour of pre-Budget advice to Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor. The psychological impact on consumers of an extra penny or two on income tax would be acceptable, they said, but an extension of value added tax would not. In its first ever Budget briefing the British Psychological Society said the chancellor's priority next Tuesday should be to bolster consumer confidence, so that the UK continued to pull out of recession, while at the same time tackling the budget deficit. Professor Cary Cooper of the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology said: 'People would be very worried about any zero-rated goods getting VAT because they are uncertain about how indirect taxation affects them. But most people realise there's a big deficit and they would accept one or two pence on income tax . . . it would give them a better sense of control.' The society said the City would prefer an extension of VAT to items such as luxury foods but would see VAT on newspapers and children's clothes as 'psychologically and politically damaging'. Consumer confidence would be best served by defence cuts but cuts in services such as health and education 'would force consumers to hoard and not to spend, and would adversely affect the recovery'. The society said, however, that the City would prefer social security cuts, because the defence industry was so important to the economy. Dr Howard Kahn of Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, who has surveyed 225 dealers, said that for some City workers - such as share and currency dealers - the worst outcome would be a dull budget. 'There's a danger for the government that policy might be influenced by the dealers' desire for change for its own sake,' he said.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department hereby revokes the antidumping duty order with respect to Frutropic, as it has demonstrated three consecutive years of sales at not less than FMV, and it is not likely that Frutropic will sell subject merchandise at less than FMV in the future. As required by 19 CFR 353.25(c)(2)(ii), the Department has conducted a verification of all factual information submitted by Frutropic in this administrative review. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We have also examined Frutropic's claim that it is not required to file an agreement under 19 CFR 353.25(a)(2)(iii). Section 353.35(a)(2)(iii) states that: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> For producers or resellers that the Secretary previously has determined to have sold the merchandise at less than foreign market value, the producers or resellers agree in writing to their immediate reinstatement in the order, as long as any producer or reseller is subject to the order, if the Secretary concludes under section 353.22(f) that the producer or reseller, subsequent to the revocation, sold the merchandise at less than foreign market value. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> As Frutropic was not originally investigated and has not been found to have sold at less than FMV in the first administrative review or in any of the other years in which the company was reviewed, we determine that Frutropic has not sold the merchandise at less than FMV for purposes of 19 CFR 353.25(a)(2)(iii), and is not required to submit an agreement to immediate reinstatement in the order. The Department is, therefore, revoking the order with respect to Frutropic. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> However, if the Department concludes from available information that changed circumstances sufficient to warrant a review exist with respect to exports of FCOJ from Frutropic, the Department will initiate a changed circumstances antidumping administrative review under 19 CFR 353.22(f). Further, if as a result of this changed circumstances review, the Department concludes that, subsequent to revocation, Frutropic sold the subject merchandise at less-than-fair-value (LTFV), the Department will reinstate the order with respect to Frutropic. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department will instruct the U.S. Customs Service to assess antidumping duties on all appropriate entries. With respect to Frutropic's entries, the Department will instruct Customs to terminate suspension of liquidation, to liquidate all entries without regard to antidumping duties and to cease collecting cash deposits. Since the margins for Branco Peres and Citropectina are  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> de minimis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and zero, respectively, the Department shall not require a cash deposit of antidumping duties on entries of FCOJ from these companies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Furthermore, the following deposit requirements will be effective upon publication of this notice of final results of administrative review for all shipments of the subject merchandise, entered or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the publication date, as provided for by section 751(a)(1) of the Act: (1) the cash deposit rate for the reviewed companies will be as outlined above; (2) for previously reviewed or investigated companies not listed above, the cash deposit rate will continue to be the company-specific rate published for the most recent period; (3) if the exporter is not a firm covered in this review, a prior review, or the original LTFV investigation, but the manufacturer is, the cash deposit rate will be the rate established for the most recent period for the manufacture of the merchandise; (4) the cash deposit rate for all other manufacturers or exporters will be 1.96 percent, the ``all other'' rate established in the original LTFV investigation by the Department (52 FR 9324, March 17, 1989), in accordance with the decisions of the Court of International Trade in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Floral Trade Council <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> United States <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , Slip Op. 993&hyph;79, and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Federal-Mogul Corporation <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> United States <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , Slip Op. 93&hyph;83. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This notice serves as a final reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file a certificate regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during this review period. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement of antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This notice serves as the only reminder to parties subject to administrative protective order (APO) of their responsibilities concerning the return or destruction of proprietary information disclosed under APO in accordance with 19 CFR 353.34(d). Failure to comply is a violation of the APO. This administrative review and notice are in accordance with sections 751(a)(1)(B) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1)(B)) and 19 CFR 353.22 and 353.25. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: October 11, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Susan G.

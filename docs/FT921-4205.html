			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / Arts: I vespri siciliani - Opera De Nice Since Italy is not far down the road, the region only ceded to France in 1860, Nice may claim justification for doing in the Italian translation Verdi's first opera written wholly for Paris. A retrograde step, yet any competent staging of Les Vepres siciliennes deserves attention. If it does not have the variety and epic sweep of the succeeding middle-period operas the score, with its electric energy, taut wires and cold steel, has a special fascination. This production by Bruno Stefano was based on 'an original idea' by Jean-Claude Auvray. Presumably this idea was to set the action not in the 13th century Palermo but in the fascist era with risorgimento undertones - Procida arrives from his journey wearing a long black cloak, carrying a leather holdall; the Duchess Elena first appears in a short skirt, but her wedding dress is based on the one worn by Sophie Cruvelli, who sang the role at the premiere in 1855. Since the librettist Scribe's version of history was cock-eyed, this need not matter much. What did matter was that Hubert Monloup's sets and costumes, initially pleasing but trivialised by hints of mortality given by marble memorials, graveyard crosses and wreaths, made a cumulatively flimsy effect. Too parochial, not the shocks rippling outward into the world as they did after the historical event, but a local affair of a kind familiar in Sicily. Even so, little was implied of Palermo's oppressive combination of splendours and miseries. The musical side under Christian Badea was commendable for a repertory production scheduled only for three performances - which means that there wasn't quite the tinder-dry crackling edge the music needs in the ensembles. The local chorus was augmented by a choir from Belgrade University. It was a pleasure to hear many unfamiliar voices. For pure vocalism, pride of place must go to the very talented young Chinese bass Dong-Jian Gong, who sang Procida with engaging ease. That he conveyed little more than cardboard patriotism was at least partly Scribe's fault for flattening out the character. The lovers were American. Frances Ginsberg as Elena phrased musically and warmly: the top of the voice was bright but lower down turned to reediness. The wedding bolero curdled. As Arrigo Allan Glassman displayed a glowing, resonant tenor. The most satisfying portrait came from the French baritone Rene Massis in the rewarding role of Guy de Montfort, the Governor of Sicily who discovers that the insurgent Arrigo is his son. With his French timbre, not obviously a heroic Verdi baritone, his moulding of the long lines was as eloquent as it was skilful. In spite of his slight build Massis commanded the stage with effective, economical movements. It is the fate of minor characters in many Verdi operas to remain confusingly anonymous figures,but on this occasion one stood out for his vigorous projection - Christophe Fel, strong and clear as Robert, the drunken French soldier whose insulting behaviour to Elena sets the train of events in motion.</p>

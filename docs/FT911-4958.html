			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / Observer: Royal coo is Gamble Royal Insurance's decision to appoint a chief operating officer may not seem the most earth-shattering event. But it is yet another indication that one of the weakest of the UK composites is finally trying to put its house in order before someone else comes to its assistance. The shiny new 'coo' title goes to Richard Gamble, the 51-year-old finance director, and although the other executive directors will continue to report direct to Ian Rushton, the chief executive , Gamble is a man to watch. Not only is Rushton, at 59, within three years of retirement, but he will soon be giving a good deal of time to the Association of British Insurers - he starts a two-year term as chairman in July. So Gamble will be responsible for seeing that Royal delivers on its much vaunted 'improvement programmes', which probably means it will have to recruit another finance director. The new coo is one of the growing breed of wandering financial managers, having passed through Lowndes Lambert, Data 100, McDonnell Douglas, and British Airways where he served under Gordon Dunlop, one of Commercial Union's less successful chief executives. Like him, Gamble is a chartered accountant, and similarly caused some surprise in an inbred industry when he was brought in from outside in 1986. There, however, the similarities end. As Royal's first finance director in 1986, Gamble is regarded as one of those competent money managers who thinks there is not much difference between an insurance company and an airline when it comes to running them. What counts is customer-service and squeezing the cost base. Having leapfrogged 50-year-old Robin Rowland, a Royal veteran, Gamble is Rushton's obvious heir apparent, provided he makes a success of his new job. But as neighbouring Midland Bank has proved many times over, bringing in outsiders and giving them fancy new titles is the easy bit.</p>

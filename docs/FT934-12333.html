			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Leeds/N&amp;P The Arthur Daley character employed in the Leeds' commercials has, it seems, been stung by National &amp; Provincial's bee. The differences in culture between the two building societies proved irreconcilable. Given the proposed merger was born of desire rather than desperation, it was wise to call a halt before it grew too serious. The merger's rationale depended on some painful rationalisation, which could only have worked had there been complete harmony of purpose. Leeds will resume its search for a chief executive and, perhaps, for a new merger partner. It seems likely to settle for a more conventional manager than Mr David O'Brien and a less risky partner than N&amp;P.</p>

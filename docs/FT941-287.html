			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Plumbing the depths in search of food - Fishermen are showing increased interest in unfamiliar, deep-sea varieties, but scientists warn that this is a particularly vulnerable resource Odd-looking fish that live in total darkness in the deep waters of the North Atlantic are causing something of a stir among fishermen and marine scientists. The fishing industry is increasingly interested in these deep sea species, which include orange roughy, blue ling and round nose grenadier, as stocks of better-known fish such as cod dwindle and international quotas are tightened. But scientists are warning that controls on deep sea fishing must be introduced before commercial exploitation becomes too widespread, threatening to wipe out a particularly vulnerable resource. Deep water fish grow and reproduce more slowly than common species and the danger is that they may be caught before breeding and replenishing the stock. The orange roughy, for example, lives to 100 years, maturing at around 20 or 30. Cod, by comparison, lives to about 15 years if it escapes the nets, and matures at about three. 'If you have a lot of fishing effort on one stock you could clean it out very quickly and it would take a hell of a long time to recover,' says Mr John Tumilty, technical director of the UK's Sea Fish Industry Authority. Spurred by French success in the last five years in catching deep water fish off western Scotland and creating a domestic market for them, the authority convened a meeting of international scientists this month to pool the limited knowledge about these species. The aim is to prevent over-exploitation of the kind that has led to a collapse in fish stocks off Newfoundland and the north-east coast of the US and a serious depletion in stocks of cod and most other common species in the North Sea. 'We see this as an opportunity to take early management decisions on these species to try to avoid the mistakes there have been in the past,' says Mr Tumilty. There are at least 120 different species living at depths of between 500m and 3,000 metres off western Scotland, and about 25 of these could be of commercial importance, according to Dr John Gordon of the Scottish Association for Marine Science. Dr Gordon is conducting a one-year study to ascertain whether fishing these species is sustainable commercially and ecologically. Some are already well-known and appreciated in other parts of the world. The orange roughy, for example, has been caught in New Zealand waters since the 1970s and its thick, white, boneless fillets find a ready market in the US. Russian fishermen have been catching North Atlantic deep water fish for ten to 15 years and there has been activity in the past few years by Faroese and Spanish fishermen in the waters off Scotland. French trawlers began fishing there in 1989. But it is their recent success in exploiting orange roughy, which skulk off steep slopes in depths of about 1,200 metres and are among the most valuable fish caught off Scotland, that has created the new flurry of interest. The French, understandably secretive about where they fish, land their catches in Scotland and transport them overland to be shipped to markets in France. They are believed to be catching some 5,000 tonnes a year. According to Dr Gordon, the orange roughy contains a high proportion of valuable oil with similar properties to sperm whale and jojoba oil, but only a small amount is currently recovered by the New Zealand fishing industry. Some UK fishermen are now also keen to venture beyond the continental shelf, where they catch fish at depths of 100m to 250m. But there is uncertainty about whether Britons will accept the strange appearance of some of the deep water fish. 'It's market driven,' explains Mr Tumilty. 'Grenadier is found in most supermarkets in France and there's no problem of acceptability. But the French tend to be less conservative in their eating habits.' Following this month's meeting of experts, detailed recommendations on controls such as quotas will be sent to the European Commission and to governments including the UK, France, Canada, Russia, Iceland, Norway and Spain. The International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, which groups marine scientists from many countries, will meet in Copenhagen in August to study the problem. 'Our message to fisheries managers is clear,' says Mr Tumilty. 'This resource is fragile and needs to be managed sensibly and sensitively. If this is done, it has the potential to provide us with valuable food.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tallinn, Mar 22, BNS -- The Estonian Foreign  Ministry is working on a new wording of a draft agreement on  social guarantees for the retired Russian military living in the  country.    The text of the agreement is to be taken for discussion at  the next round of the Estonian-Russian talks due on Apr. 5-6,  said Ago Tiiman, secretary of the Estonian delegation for the  talks.    "Virtually this is the same draft that was discussed before.  We are now working on the provisions that were not agreed upon  with Russia and we are trying to find a text that would be  satisfactory for both sides," Tiiman said.    Opposition MP [member of parliament] Tiit Made, however,  warned that Estonia might be backing down on its original  position and bend to making concessions to Russia over the  issue.    "It is questionable if the new wording of the agreement is  in  conformity with the existing laws, because it is possible to  change the laws any time in the State Assembly at the ruling  coalition's proposal. Also the text of the agreement can be  changed so that it would be acceptable for both sides and can be  interpreted whatever way one sees to be proper," Made said.    The opposition MP said it seemed to him as if pressure had  been exerted upon the Estonian Foreign Ministry lately.    "Apparently the Foreign Ministry faces the risk of being  left  standing alone, as our great friend Latvia has been pinned to  the floor," Made said, referring to Latvia and Russia having  initialed an agreement on the conditions, timetable and  regulations for the withdrawal of Russian troops from Latvia and  on the legal status of the Russian troops during the period of  the withdrawal.    "I would very much like to know what Russian Prime Minister  Viktor Chernomyrdin spoke during his visit to Helsinki to the  Finnish leaders and what did Finnish Prime Minister Esko Aho  tell his Estonian colleagues after that," Made told BNS.    Tiiman said Estonia was not going to retreat before any of  Russia's demands.    "If the agreement on social guarantees for the retired  Russian military happens to be signed, MP Tiit Made has the full  right to protest its text upon its ratification and prove that  it means Estonia's surrendering to Russia," Tiiman said.    Made contested Tiiman's suggestions, saying he would be  unable to do this because he has not got the parliament majority  backing him.    Made said he as an MP could do whatever he wished, but the  ruling coalition would still get what it wants by voting down  any opposition. He said there were signs of danger in the air.    Prime Minister Mart Laar at today's press conference told  BNS  that Made was having a "lively fantasy." The premier assured  reporters that nobody had exerted pressure on Estonia.    "On the contrary: a large number of Western countries have  expressed support to our demands. At one time we were very  close to signing a general agreement on troop withdrawal with  Russia. Now we hope that also Russia has the intention to move  ahead at the forthcoming round of talks. All that we do stays  in conformity with the Estonian laws and we are not going to  change the laws, neither will Estonia back down on its demands,"  Laar said.    Made said the issue at stake was giving residence permits to  4,200-4,500 retired Russian military living in Estonia.    Estonia's chief negotiator for the talks with Russia, Vaino  Reinart, explained that Russia with the social guarantees  agreement for its retired military wished to establish the  circle of persons entitled to apply for a residence permit in  Estonia. Reinart said Estonia, from its side, wanted that the  agreement instead of determining the circle of persons  established regulations for how the retired Russian military  would get their pensions from Russia and pay for the medical  services.    The other key issue is how to privatize the flats of the  retired Russian military. Russia wants that Estonia issued its  privatization vouchers to the military for their service in the  armed forces.    "Since Estonia is not giving vouchers even to its own  citizens for the years of service in the Russian Army, the  Russian side wants to get a little more rights for the retired  Russian military than what Estonian citizens are having,"  Reinart told BNS.</p>

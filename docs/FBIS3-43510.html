The troops were on Nigerian territory and had no  "expansionist" intentions, he added, explaining that the aim was  to show local people that they had not been abandoned by the  authorities.    Press reports said that last week Cameroonian paramilitary  police carried out a raid against Abana fishing village in Cross  River state, killing six people. Six women have been reported  missing since.    THE GUARDIAN newspaper, citing sources close to the security  forces, said the Cameroonian gendarmes threw the baby child of  one of the villagers into the water after she said she did not  have to pay them money they had demanded.    Fourteen fishing vessels were sunk during the raid, the  independent newspaper said.</p>

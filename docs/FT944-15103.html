			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Brussels outlaws shipping 'cartel' The European Commission yesterday outlawed the Trans-Atlantic Agreement (TAA), a shipping 'conference' which set cargo rates and capacity levels across the North Atlantic, because it infringed its competition rules. This decision represents a victory for exporters who complained the agreement had led to excessive charges for shipping container cargoes and a defeat for the 15 large shipping lines which set up the agreement in 1992. The ruling is however only the first stage in resolving this dispute because the shipowners established a modified arrangement, known as the Trans-Atlantic Conference Agreement (TACA) in July. Earlier this month they made a further concession by offering to remove capacity constraints from the TACA. A decision on the TACA is expected within the next few weeks. The British Shippers' Council, representing exporters, said the commission's ruling established an important principle which would have implications for similar conference agreements covering trade with the Far East and Africa. If the TACA is also rejected there could be a return to lower transatlantic shipping rates and a resumption of the losses which plagued this route in the late 1980s. Members of the TAA include P&amp;O, Maersk, Nedlloyd, AP Moeller and Hapag-Lloyd.</p>

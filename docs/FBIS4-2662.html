			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Liu Yun-lung (0491 0061 7893): "Opinion Poll Shows a </F> Quarter of Hong Kong People Favor Independence"]    [Excerpts] A survey by Baptist College and the University  of Science and Technology suggests that the Chinese-British  dispute has produced a bad impact on Hong Kong voters' voting  intentions. More than 40 percent of respondents indicated that  they had no confidence at all in whether the Chinese side would  consider Hong Kong people's greatest interests in implementing  the Basic Law.    In addition, more than 40 percent of Hong Kong people are  willing to see Hong Kong's reversion to the mainland under the  principle of one country, two systems, provided they can decide  the outcome of history, but a quarter of them favor "making Hong  Kong independent" and 15 percent are willing to see "Hong Kong  continuing to remain a British colony," a fall of 6 percent  compared with the percentage in August last year.    Baptist College and the University of Science and Technology  conducted a "sociopolitical volatility" telephone survey under  their "Hong Kong in Transition Program." In February they made  2,610 random telephone calls for sample surveying, during which  1,074 qualified residents were contacted, while the rest were  not residential telephone numbers.    In this survey, 626 people who met the requirements were  interviewed, which was 59 percent of residents contacted. With  95 percent accuracy, the sample survey error was under 4 percent.    Lau Chui-wai, a lecturer at Baptist College in charge of the  research program, said that Hong Kong people's anxiety remained  high in the past year. Almost half (40 percent) of respondents  expressed different worries, including worries over their  personal standard of living, personal freedom, family life, Hong  Kong's future, and post- 1997 political prospects.    She stressed that these worries continued because of the  breakdown of the Chinese-British talks but that people's worries  over Hong Kong's future seem to have eased. In comparison with  last year, respondents worried about the "1997 issue" fell by 9  percent, and 10 percent of respondents expressed extreme worry  about personal freedom and Hong Kong's political prospects.  [passage omitted]    The Baptist College and University of Science and Technology  survey suggests that most respondents said that Hong Kong would  have corruption problems similar to those on the mainland after  1997 and believe that mainland corruption has spread to Hong  Kong.    The "sociopolitical volatility" telephone survey indicates  that 66 percent of the 423 respondents who frequently go to the  mainland said that a corruption problem similar to that on the  mainland would appear in Hong Kong after 1997, a 7 percent  decrease compared with August last year, the number of those  answering "no idea" increased by 8 percent, and the number of  respondents saying that mainland corruption would not endanger  Hong Kong remained unchanged.    This survey also discovered that Hong Kong people no longer  had illusions about the Hong Kong Government, because they  generally believe that corruption has spread to Hong Kong.  Sixty eight percent of respondents said that corruption was a  big problem facing the Hong Kong Government, an increase of 4  percent on August last year, while 18 percent said it was not a  problem, a fall of 7 percent.

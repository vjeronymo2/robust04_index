			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Pavel Kuznetsov] </F>   [Text] Moscow January 12 TASS -- Leaders of all  parliamentary factions and groups issued the first warning to  nationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy on Thursday and  threatened to block his representatives from State Duma ruling  bodies in case he continues to speak out without an official  request to take the floor.    The warning appeared after three factions stormed out of the  conference hall where faction leaders were meeting in protest  against Zhirinovskiy's demand that he himself should chair the  meeting because his Liberal Democratic Party was the first in  the parliamentary elections.    He proposed that the next meeting of the leaders can be  chaired by the faction, which ended second in the polls, i.e.,  the Russia's Choice.    Lawmakers opposed and offered a representative of the "Women  of Russia" bloc to chair the meeting, but Zhirinovskiy was  against it.    The Russia's Choice, the Party of Russian Unity and Accord,  and the Women of Russia left the meeting in protest.    A compromise was reached in their absence that Nikolay  Travkin, the leader of the Democratic Party of Russia, which was  the last in the elections, would chair the meeting.  Zhirinovskiy also agreed with the proposal.    Travkin then convinced the three factions to return to the  meeting.    After that representatives of all factions and groups in the  State Duma, natrurally excluding the Liberal Democratic Party,  agreed that in case Zhirinovskiy continues to speak out without  officially requesting to take the floor they will jointly block  his faction and would not allow his representatives to work in  the ruling bodies of the lower chamber.</p>

			<p>931229 FT  29 DEC 93 / North-south divide narrows Lower house prices have led to a significant narrowing of house price differentials between different areas of the country, says Halifax. Prices in southern England, hit worst by the recession, are now only 15 per cent above the national average compared with nearly 60 per cent higher in 1988. Northern prices are only 15 per cent below the national average compared with 35 per cent lower five years ago. The society said regional economies and unemployment rates had converged during the recession, so it did not expect price differentials to widen again as the housing market improved. Lower prices and falling interest rates meant that the cost of buying a home had fallen substantially in every region. 'For those in work, earnings have risen by more than 30 per cent over the past four years so the Pounds 280 payment is a much smaller proportion of earnings than it would have been in the late 1980s,' said the society.</p>

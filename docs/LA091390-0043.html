			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Q&amp;A WITH WAYNE GRETZKY;  </P> <P> HE'S ON THE ICE, FEELING FIT AGAIN;  </P> <P> HOCKEY: HIS BACK IS SOUND AND THE KINGS ARE GETTING BETTER. AND PEOPLE WHO SAY  HE'S THE AVERAGE ONE MOTIVATE HIM TO CONTINUED GREATNESS.  </P> <P> When you've broken every significant record, become the greatest player in the  history of your sport and led your team to a decade of dominance, all before  your 30th birthday, there wouldn't seem to be too much left open to question.  </P> <P> But at 29, Wayne Gretzky finds whispers and rumors swirling about him on the  eve of his 12th National Hockey League season. Such as:  </P> <P>  -- He has begun to skate on the downside of his career.  </P> <P>  -- He will never win a Stanley Cup for the Kings.  </P> <P>  -- The back injury he suffered at last season's end could linger.  </P> <P>  -- He is the team's de facto general manager, making the key decisions with  owner Bruce McNall while Rogie Vachon serves as a figurehead.  </P> <P> Here for the Kings' training camp, Gretzky sat down with reporters to comment  on these and other subjects, including drug revelations concerning his former  team, the Edmonton Oilers.  </P> <P> Question: Let's start with the question you must have been asked a thousand  times this summer: How's your back?  </P> <P> Answer: The doctors have told me it's fine. It's just a matter of building the  strength up. I've been doing a lot of sit-ups. If I worry about it, I think  that's when you get hit and get hurt. In scrimmages, I've been getting some  hits. Not heavy hits, just body contact, and it's been holding up fine.  </P> <P> Q: Were you ever worried that it was a career-threatening injury?  </P> <P> A: Before the first test, yeah, I was worried because if it was my disk, then  you're talking career-threatening. But when they said it was my muscles, I  wasn't worried, because then, it's a matter of time and strengthening them.  </P> <P> Q: Did doctors give you any advice on keeping your back sound?  </P> <P> A: Yeah, they told me to stay out of the corners and I'd be fine.  </P> <P> Q: In your two years in Los Angeles, the Kings have yet to win a second-round  playoff game. Is the organization really any closer to a Stanley Cup?  </P> <P> A: Rome wasn't built in a night. Looking at the hockey team now compared to  when I first came here, it's night and day. I remember first stepping on the  ice with the Kings, coming from a Stanley Cup champion, and thinking, 'whoa,  we've got a long way to go here.' Their minor league team was older than our  team, all 30-, 31-, 32-year-olds. That's not how you build a minor league  system. Now they've gone outside and signed as many 21-, 22-year-olds as they  can. There's some direction from (Coach) Tommy (Webster), Rogie and Bruce.  That's been so positive. We're getting more depth. It just makes it more fun.  </P> <P> Q: But not as much fun as it was last season in Edmonton, where your old team,  the Oilers, returned to the top two years after trading you. Was it tough to  sit in Los Angeles and watch your former teammates win their first Cup without  you?  </P> <P> A: Oh no, that doesn't bother me at all. Because I played with those guys, I  know how good they are. The only thing I'm disappointed in is that we weren't  there. They played well. They deserved to win. I was hoping they'd win. First  of all, they're my friends. I have absolutely no ill feelings toward them.  Second of all, they're the team that knocked us out. And thirdly, it's our  division. For years, we've been trying to gain respect for our division. It was  my off-season, and I didn't want to get in front of the TV to watch every game.  I'll admit that. But I watched one in Paris at 2 in the morning and I watched  the final game in L.A.  </P> <P> Q: The Oilers have a new challenge to overcome with the recent story in the  Edmonton Journal that goalie Grant Fuhr was a cocaine user for seven years  before entering a rehabilitation center last summer. Did you know about that?  </P> <P> A: (The Oilers) are good people. They don't deserve that. I never saw it. You  always hear different reports, but you believe nothing of what you hear and  half of what you see. It just amazes me that it did go on, because (Fuhr)  figured in most of our wins. He played so well. A lot of people are taking  shots at (General Manager) Glen (Sather). I know Glen has sent players through  rehab. He's taken care of them as far as getting help (goes), put them in rehab  and paid for it. I know two or three guys he helped, and I'm talking before Cup  winners. To say that he didn't care and it's his fault Grant is in this  situation, that's not fair to Glen.  </P> <P> Q: What should the league do about it?  </P> <P> A: The policy of the president (John Ziegler) is that he doesn't believe there  is a drug problem in the NHL. If he takes a stand that you can get help, that  there is a rehab program, I guess that's like saying we do have a problem.  Drugs won't be tolerated. Therefore, there is no rehab program. If you do it,  you're out of hockey. It's plain and simple. I think, in general, it's out of  the game, but let me tell you, it's everywhere in society.  </P> <P> Q: Do you agree with Ziegler's policy?  </P> <P> A: I agree with him in a lot of ways, but I think in the next Players'  Association agreement, something is going to have to be done. If there are  players out there that need help, better to save them than have them mess up  their lives. I don't know how many players are in that situation. I can't  comprehend being able to skate while on a substance. Skating alone is an art.  Doing it on a substance? I don't know. That's got to be tough.  </P> <P> Q: In your just-published book, 'Gretzky: An Autobiography,' you talk bitterly  about the harsh treatment you received in your hometown, Brantford, from some  of the parents of your teammates when you were a kid -- the jealousies that  surfaced when, at age 10, you had already become a dominant player. Was that a  catharsis for you, a venting of feelings you had long kept pent up?  </P> <P> A: I have absolutely no complaints about my life. But people think I got handed  everything, all this kind of fell in my lap, that I was just God-gifted with  all this talent. I wanted people to realize it's a lot tougher than just waking  up one day and you're in the NHL.  </P> <P> Q: Do you feel you missed anything in your childhood?  </P> <P> A: I don't think I missed anything as far as fun, friends and that sort of  thing. But I moved away from home when I was 13. I have a little brother  (Brent) I hardly know. He's almost 18 years old now. When I left home, he was  3. I wouldn't say I'm bitter, but I'm not really excited the way it turned out.  I moved an hour away from home just to get away from the pressure.  </P> <P> Q: Any advice for kids today facing that kind of pressure?  </P> <P> A: I get a lot of parents coming up to me, telling me they are grooming their  kids to be professional athletes. I'm really against that. I think it's a great  life, and yeah, you can lead them in that direction. But I think a lot of  parents live their lives through the kids. Because they didn't make it, they  want their kids to make it. It puts a lot of undue pressure on the kids. For  everyone that makes it, nine or 10 quit when they're 16, 17. I was reading  about the USC quarterback (Todd Marinovich) who was groomed to the point where  he couldn't eat cake at birthday parties. I think sports for kids is the  greatest thing in the world because it teaches you how to share, about winning  and losing and pressure. But I don't think you should force your kid to become  a professional athlete. Q: How about your own son, Ty, born earlier this  summer? He'll have some pretty big skates to fill.  </P> <P> A: If he wants to play hockey, great, I'll take him to the rink. If he wants to  play baseball, great. Same thing if my daughter (21-month-old Paulina) wants to  play. But I'm not going to let them live and die it. Schooling is important,  family is important and a lot of other things.  </P> <P> Q: In your book, you talk about people always predicting it was just a matter  of time until you tumbled from your pedestal. When you were 10, they said it  would happen by the time you were 12. . . . This past year, the stories began  that you have passed your prime, that the Great One has become the Average One.  Is it starting all over again?  </P> <P> A: It never ended. It becomes almost funny. People in general want to build  somebody up and then try to knock them down. They always root for the underdog.  When I came in the league, Guy Lafleur and Marcel Dionne were the two who  carried the league. And everybody rooted for me to beat them and win a scoring  title. But after I won two or three in a row, people couldn't wait for the next  guy to come along and knock me down. And now, there's Mario (Lemieux). I told  him, there's going to come a point in time when people are going to start  saying some other guy is better. It's already started. People are waiting for  (Eric) Lindros to knock Lemieux down. That's what makes sports go. To say I'm  washed up, I'm probably the only guy in hockey who can win a scoring title and  everybody is saying I had a bad year. I don't worry about it.  </P> <P> Q: Not at all?  </P> <P> A: It doesn't bother me, but it motivates me. No question about that. I get  hungry to prove people wrong. But my whole life, I've always been in the  situation where if the team wins, I'm going to take the roses. Oh, Gretzky  played so well. But if the team loses, I'm on the other side of the road.  Gretzky played awful. That's what happened last year. We didn't have a very  good year, and I take the responsibility.  </P> <P> Q: Do you feel you're still playing as well as ever?  </P> <P> A: I feel my game changed the last two years simply because I went from playing  with two All-Stars (Jari Kurri and Esa Tikkanen) to a lot of different people.  Nothing against those people, but it's not easy to play with me. We were  changing and changing and changing. A lot of it had to do with the fact the  club didn't want to break up (Luc) Robitaille and (Bernie) Nicholls and others.  That was important to the team. So I played with guys from the minor leagues. I  played with everybody. But that was fine. I understood that. Now, I'm real  excited about playing with Tony (Granato) and Tommy (Sandstrom).  </P> <P> Q: Almost since you arrived in Los Angeles, there have been stories that you  make the key personnel decisions on the team in conjunction with McNall, that  Vachon is the general manager in name only. Those whispers grew after last  year's trade of Nicholls. Your reaction?  </P> <P> A: I really get frustrated by it. In Edmonton, as much as my teammates came to  me and asked me for advice on things and wanted me to communicate with  management, they knew I was a player. That's the way I am here. I have to go to  work with these guys every day. I need Marty (McSorley) and Jay (Miller) behind  me. I don't want those guys to think I'm the one saying, 'Trade that guy, trade  that guy.' That's not right. If they ask me for advice on different players I  played with or against, I tell them automatically. If I know the players as  individuals, if I think they're a winner or a loser, if I think they care, I  say so. But beyond that, I don't go to Rogie and say, 'You've got to trade this  guy.' That's absolutely asinine. Part of the problem is that Rogie keeps a low  profile. Players sometimes think they can take advantage of him because he is  low-key. That's the misconception. He's quiet, but he can be stern. Tommy and  Rogie are my bosses. They make the decisions. I have enough to worry about  playing hockey without worrying about who is going to play on the minor league  team and all the other things. My brother (Keith) was a free agent and he  didn't get offered a contract anywhere. . . . That doesn't mean I'm not friends  with Bruce. He changed my whole life. But I also know he's my boss, and I would  never embarrass him or try to disappoint him.  </P> <P> Q: But is it not reasonable to assume that if King management was about to  trade Nicholls for Granato and Sandstrom, two guys that would skate on your  line, they would first consult you?  </P> <P> A: Yeah, it is. If we don't win, my neck is in the noose. So when they ask me  about things, I can either be quiet, turn my cheek the other way and maybe  never win, or I can step forward and say, 'Hey, this guy can play,' or, 'That  guy can't play.' One of my best friends on the team was Bernie. . . . We were  good companions. Having said all that, I still believe it was a good trade.  </P> <P> Q: When will your playing days be over?  </P> <P> A: I hope to play another six years. I'll be 35 years old at that time. That'll  be 18 years as a pro for me. . . . Of course, if I get 190 points when I'm 35  and we win 50 games, I'm sure I'll play more. It's hard to walk away when it's  been your whole life and then, all of a sudden, it's over.  </P></p>

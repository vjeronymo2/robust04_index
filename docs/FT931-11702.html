			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gold production record GOLD PRODUCTION outside the former eastern bloc countries reached a new peak last year, according Mining Journal's International Gold Newsletter. It is estimated to have risen 3.4 per cent or 59.9 tonnes from the 1991 level, from 1,781.6 tonnes to 1,841.5 tonnes. Mines in the US are estimated to have shown the biggest tonnage increase: 27.6 tonnes or 9 per cent, to 327.6 tonnes, mainly because of the continued expansion of several large mines. South Africa's gold output also remained buoyant and was up by 12.8 tonnes, or 2 per cent, to 613.9 tonnes. Australia, which saw a drop in gold production in 1991, reversed the trend last year and produced an extra 3.5 per cent or 8.5 tonnes to take its total to 242.7 tonnes. This was still a little short of 1990's record 243.1 tonnes. Canada is one of the few big producers where output is estimated to have fallen. Mining Journal suggests output was down by 13.6 tonnes or nearly 8 per cent to 163.1 tonnes because of a large number of mine closures in 1991-92, most of them higher-cost underground mines. Production is also estimated to have fallen in Brazil, by 8 tonnes (10 per cent) to 72 tonnes. The most notable increases last year were in Indonesia (up by 21.7 tonnes or 120 per cent to 40.1 tonnes); Papua New Guinea (up by 11.2 tonnes or 17.5 per cent to 75.5 tonnes) and Ghana (up by 12.2 tonnes or 47 per cent to 38 tonnes). Mr David Bird, editor of the newsletter, says that, in spite of the extended decline in prices last year, many gold mines survived through forward selling and more selective mining, which yielded higher grades.</p>

			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / International Company News: US court accepts CNBC bid for FNN THE PENULTIMATE battle over Financial News Network (FNN), the business news media group, ended yesterday when a bankruptcy court judge accepted a bid from CNBC, the cable television subsidiary of General Electric's NBC unit. The bid comprised Dollars 145m in cash and Dollars 9.3m in assumed liabilities. The decision paves the way to end months of fighting between Dow Jones/Westinghouse and CNBC over FNN's cable television and business radio network operations. However, there may still be one more round to fight. The Dow Jones group, which filed a civil anti-trust suit earlier this week, is seeking a temporary restraining order in an attempt to prevent the CNBC acquisition. Analysts were sceptical about the prospects of the CNBC acquisition being blocked on anti-trust grounds. Although CNBC operates the only serious competitor to FNN's 24-hour business channel, the Federal Trade Commission has already said it would not oppose a CNBC acquisition on anti-trust grounds. In February, FNN tentatively accepted a Dollars 90m bid from a joint venture between Dow Jones and Westinghouse, but it later turned it down in favour of a Dollars 105m CNBC offer. The ensuing battle, in which both suitors sweetened their offers several times, helped push the price to a level which some analysts said was more than the failed company was worth. FNN was put on the block in November, and filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code earlier this year. Both sides have a vested interest in acquiring FNN. CNBC was launched less than two years ago and provides business programmes during the day. The acquisition is expected to bolster CNBC's subscribers from 18m to more than 30m. Dow Jones, which owns the Wall Street Journal and the Dow Jones wire service, has wanted to expand into cable television for some time. The Dow Jones/Westinghouse partnership had bid Dollars 167.1m for FNN, but the total cash component of Dollars 135m was less than the CNBC offer.</p>

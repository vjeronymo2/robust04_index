Chinese sources said local  cadres were waiting for instructions that patriarch Deng  Xiaoping might give in the run-up to Lunar New Year next week,  which he is expected to celebrate in Shanghai .    Since 1991, Mr Deng has used his public appearance on Lunar  New Year Day to speak out in favour of regional administrations  "going as fast as they can". The sources said leaders from  coastal provinces had been nonplussed by retrenchment policies  announced by the central leadership over the past fortnight.  For example, Beijing has urged regional cadres to observe the  national target of nine percent growth rate for 1994.    The semi-official China News Service last night quoted  Executive Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji as scolding unnamed local  officials for going after disruptively ambitious goals. "The  major risk (for the national economy) is the excessively large  scale of fixed-assets investments," Mr Zhu said. "Some people  are very eager to overtake (others), to mount projects and to  spread themselves out. This tendency must be changed."    Central authorities have since last month taken back the  authority to grant permission for most types of fixed-assets  investments. The Chinese press yesterday quoted the  vice-governor of Guangdong, Lu Ruihua, as saying his province  would observe Beijing's new structures. Projects would only be  approved if the partners involved have sufficient funding,  including recurrent expenses.    Privately, however, individual cadres and heads of state  companies along the coast have expressed a desire to beat  central directives. Officials in Hainan, Guangzhou, Hebei and  Pudong have announced growth targets for this year of 18  percent, 16 percent, 14 percent and 30 percent respectively.  Local cadres and businessmen have indicated they would ignore  Beijing's fiats if they could secure financing from overseas or  if they could raise funds "directly from society".    Chinese sources said at the congress, deputies representing  the provinces would also try to force Beijing to moderate the  so-called dual-tax system introduced on January 1. For example,  the legislators would lobby the central Government to return a  larger portion of its increased tax revenues to the regions in  the form of transfer payments.    The pro-Chinese Hong Kong daily, WEN WEI PO, yesterday  quoted  senior Guangdong officials as indicating they had boosted their  contributions to national funds. The province's contributions  to Beijing jumped by 7.4 times from 1980 to 1992, while total  tax revenues had increased by just 6.1 times in the same period.  Guangdong cadres also stated throughout the 1980s more than 20  billion yuan (HK$17.76 billion)--or 40 percent of local fiscal  income in the period--had been used to serve the cause of reform.</p>

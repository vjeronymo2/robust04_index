			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / Lloyd's audit work opens up GUIDELINES released yesterday on auditing at the Lloyd's of London insurance market should help open it up to a larger number of accountancy firms. The notes, the second set from the Auditing Practices Board, are not designed to lay down new standards but to spread existing best practice. They cover the functions and duties of firms auditing brokers, syndicates and managing agents, and stress that the auditors are responsible above all to the individual Names - the individuals whose assets underwrite the market. Relations between Names and businesses trading on the market have become strained in recent months as a result of heavy insurance losses. Mr Graeme King, general manager at Lloyd's regulatory services group, called the notes 'a cartel-breaking document' that should lift the mystique around auditing at Lloyd's. 'This is a solid demonstration that some of the highest levels of disclosure in sets of accounts in the UK come from Lloyd's,' he said. He said it would help expand the number of auditing firms currently recognised by Lloyd's from the current 15. The notes stress how vital it was that auditors examine the strength of internal controls in the syndicates and the statistical techniques used to calculate reinsurance. Syndicates specialising in in catastrophe reinsurance have borne some of the worst losses at Lloyd's in recent years. It says auditors should report direct to the Council of Lloyd's in exceptional circumstances, such as when they no longer have faith in the integrity of senior management of the business. Practice note 2. The Lloyd's market. Auditing Practices Board. PO Box 620, Central Milton Keynes MK9 2JX. Pounds 6.50.</p>

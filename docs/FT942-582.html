			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Rail strike still on as talks fail to reach deal Tomorrow's 24-hour strike by railway signalling staff is still on after talks at Acas were adjourned early this morning without a settlement. Railtrack, the rail network operator, and RMT union officials failed to reach an agreement after 10 1/2 hours of intensive negotiations at the conciliation service, but they agreed to resume at 10am today. Mr David Armstrong, Railtrack's industrial relations director, said after the talks that the union had declined to lift the strike threat for tomorrow. 'We have not made as much progress as I would have expected. I am disappointed about that,' he added. Mr Vernon Hince, RMT's assistant general secretary, said: 'A strike is still firmly on, but we are still talking. At the present time there is still a long way to go. It is a very complicated situation.' Neither side would reveal what they had achieved so far in their marathon negotiations. Railtrack still insists it cannot pay increases for past productivity while the union says there must be an 11 per cent interim pay award for past performance. Railtrack has already offered 2.5 per cent for all its employees. Dobson backs rail union, Page 11</p>

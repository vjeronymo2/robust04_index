			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / CBI sets target for links with schools The Confederation of British Industry yesterday issued a new code of practice for building links between companies and schools. It set a target for all its members to have links with education by the year 2000. It said companies should agree goals for their school links, which should be managed 'as rigorously as any business project' and assessed by Ofsted, the government schools inspectorate. Mr Ian Dixon, chairman of the CBI's education policy panel, said: 'We can - and must - do better. The challenge now is to maintain the momentum and to improve the quality, particularly in planning, monitoring and evaluating links.' The announcement followed publication of research by Cellnet and Motorola for the Institution of Electrical Engineers, which found that secondary-school pupils did not find science teaching relevant, and were deprived of 'real life' role models to make science and technology interesting. It revealed that 85 per cent of teachers found science and technology 'difficult', while only 29 per cent of pupils used this description. Teachers were also more likely than pupils to perpetuate gender imbalances , with 65 per cent describing science as a 'male domain'. The CBI said business-school links should aim to encourage 'relevant knowledge' in pupils, and help with recruitment. A survey by the London School of Economics for the CBI showed that 80 per cent of UK companies intended to continue or extend school links in the next three years, but only 14 per cent of them used performance indicators to monitor activity. Fifteen per cent of primary schools and a third of secondary schools included links in their formal development plans. The survey shows that, since 1988, 57 per cent of companies have increased their involvement with secondary schools. Since 1988, more than half of all companies have started work with schools aimed at providing relevant skills. These include help with curriculum development and 'young enterprise' schemes, where managers are seconded to help pupils run mock companies, mock interviews, and work-based scientific projects.

			<p><P> September 7, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: ARTS  </P> <P> LATC Grant: Los Angeles' Community Redevelopment Agency voted Thursday to give  a $478,000 subsidy to the Los Angeles Theatre Center, slightly less than half  the proposed figure.  </P> <P> The allotment was based on the amount estimated necessary to complete the  1990-91 fall/winter LATC season. CRA Chairman Jim Wood said, "The board  accepted its obligation to the season ticket holders for the scheduled  performances." The figures proposed to cover property taxes and interest  payments were not granted by the CRA. The future of the LATC is still  uncertain, pending a report from Mayor Bradley's LATC Study Group.

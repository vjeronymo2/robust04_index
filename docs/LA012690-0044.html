			<p><P> January 26, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Donahue's Moore Interview Draws Crowds: More than 1,000 people lined up  Wednesday morning in Flint, Mich., for tickets to Phil Donahue's Monday show,  in which he will interview Michael Moore, maker of the General Motors Corp.  documentary "Roger &amp; Me." The satirical documentary shows Moore trying  unsuccessfully to interview GM Chairman Roger B. Smith on plant closings and  layoffs in Flint. Police helped disperse a crowd of people who waited all night  in hopes of seeing Donahue and Moore but were turned away when the 1,266 free  tickets ran out. SHAUNA SNOW  </P></p>

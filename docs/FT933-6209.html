			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Double your bid heads of government, Ross Perot, Nasa, Nato, stuff like that. Yesterday it was the UK sports minister who summoned me to his lair, to discuss Operation Final Push - the last phase of Britain's bid to stage the Olympic Games of 2000 in Manchester. D-Day is September 23, when members of the International Olympic Committee make their decision. I did not catch the sports minister's name, but I could tell from his clothes and gear - blazer, hockey tie, headguard, cycling shorts - that he was who he said he was. 'Right,' said the minister. 'Some coffee, Julian, mucho rapido.' Julian is the minister's political assistant: a Michael Portillo look-alike from the Conservatives' hard right - gangster suit, purple tie, perfect teeth, Castilian hair-style, muscular, mercurial. Age: 27. Never turn your back to him. 'Manchester,' said the minister. 'Operation Final Push. Big heave essential. Political risks considerable. But rewards, of course, immense. Everything to play for. Grateful your advice.' I said: 'What is your problem?' He said: 'As you know, the government has pumped untold billions into the bid to stage the 2000 Olympics. Manchester has acquired a surfeit of infrastructure. Nine new airports. A 12-lane ring-road. Dozens of hotels. Fifteen new museums. Hundreds of new restaurants. Waterfalls and parks. Zero-rent apartment blocks. 'And plans are well advanced for a coup de theatre: the unveiling, on the last day of the Games, of the John Major Millennial Institute of Sport and the Performing Arts. 'But the prime minister is jittery. He read in The Economist last week that Beijing, one of Manchester's main rivals, is running a campaign of the utmost ruthlessness. According to The Economist: 'When the (Olympic) committee visited Beijing, a Chinese representative simply pointed to the five rings of the Olympic flag and said: China has 1.27bn people, more than one-fifth of the world's population . . . One of those rings . . . represents (us).' Absolutely dynamite. And then there is Sydney. It is co-favourite with Beijing.' 'Sydney is smashing,' I said. 'Just so,' said the minister. 'But let us concentrate on Manchester. I have called you in, Michael, because of your intellectual rigorousness - your ability to atomise complex scenarios into fundamental particles. So here is the big question: what is our Achilles' heel? What could possibly spook us?' I said: 'Three things, actually. Numero one: the weather. It has now rained in Manchester for 613 consecutive days. They have had blizzards and typhoons and showers of speckled frogs. To date, the media have co-operated and not blown the whistle. But the scandal could leak out. Manchester's weather is a catastrophe-in-waiting. 'Numero two: everywhere in the world there is an anti-British backlash. Europe hates us. Asia despises us. So does everyone else. In The Times, Kate Muir reported this week that in New York, especially, there is a campaign in progress denigrating everything British - our boorishness, our grottiness, our racism, our snobbishness, our economic backwardness, our Marks &amp; Sparks underwear, even our garden gnomes. There is a floodtide of Anglophobia raging. 'Numero three: John Major. He's your biggest problem. You know he's got to go, so why muck around? Replace him with Portillo.' From the chair next to mine, Julian flashed a smile. 'But you can forget the Olympics. Manchester? Not a hope.' 'So what should I do?' I steepled my fingers and let my braincells whirr, atomising the scenario into fundamental particles. I said: 'There could be a solution. Your best bet, minister, hinges on the fact that Queen Elizabeth II is still Queen of Australia and Australia's head of state. So . . . despatch our nuclear submarines. Have them resurface in Sydney harbour. Take Australia back. It is one of the world's best countries. The Aussies wouldn't mind. I am sure they would welcome you. Their brains have been softened by sun, sex and surf. By reconquering Australia you will acquire Sydney's bid to stage the Games of 2000. The IOC would love that. Adios, Beijing. And we'd all fly south and live in Australia. Bondi here we come.' The minister said: 'Your cheque is in the post.'</p>

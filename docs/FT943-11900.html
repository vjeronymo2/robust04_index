			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / IMF urges New Delhi to speed up reform pace The International Monetary Fund has recommended an accelerated pace of reform in India and 'a more vigorous approach to removing structural weaknesses'. The IMF annual report presented by its executive board in Washington yesterday expressed concern about a 'worrisome' rise in prices and 'considerable fiscal slippage in 1993-94, despite a good monsoon. There was a 'considerable widening of the budget deficit in 1993-94, a persistence of high domestic interest rates, and a sluggish industrial recovery, as well as the related surge in capital inflows that had complicated monetary management and added to inflationary pressures.' The Fund said 'external viability was not yet assured'. The Indian government had made progress in 'articulating a broad framework for structural reform' in core areas like trade, financial sector liberalisation and tax reform, but 'progress had been slower in restructuring public enterprises and in increasing the flexibility of markets for labour and land.' Commending India for further reductions in import tariffs, the Fund advocated early action to replace quantitative restrictions on consumer goods imports with appropriate tariffs. The directors urged the government to return 'quickly and decisively to the path of fiscal reforms,' with a 'less distortionary and more revenue-elastic tax system' and lower interest rates to encourage private investment. More than 54,000 people have fled their villages in the north-east Indian state of Assam since tribal militants killed some 50 Moslems at the weekend, senior officials said yesterday, Reuter reports from Barpeta, India. The Indian government sent the army into Barpeta and adjoining districts following the raid by Bodo militants fighting for their own state within India. There have been several outbreaks of such violence in recent years, usually with the militants attacking Moslems recently arrived from Bangladesh.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The State Duma (the lower house of Russian  parliament) has called both on Kiev and Simferopol for "a show  of restraint and wisdom and renunciation of hasty or emotional  actions". "We are aware of how hopeless and fatal can be any  attempt to try to resolve by force controversial issues relating  to a popular drive for self- determination", its appeal adopted  late on Wednesday says. This was approved without discussion on  Speaker of Parliament Ivan Rybkin's proposal.    The Duma speaks of "perceiving with hope a report on the  first moves" for dialogue and consensus that Ukrainian and  Crimean deputies made during talks in Kiev.    The Russian deputies expect their counterparts on both sides  not to allow irresponsible politicians to endanger public peace  and security because of their one-off considerations.    For its part, the Duma is prepared "with the delicate  situation being taken into account" to do all it can to help  towards the searches of compromise on the basis of the  Russian-Ukrainian treaty of November 19, 1990.    "For the past two centuries, Crimea has served and we are  sure, will continue to serve the interests of the fraternal  nations of Ukraine and Russia", the appeal says.</p>

			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / TV stations resist police moves to claim riot film THE integrity and impartiality of the media will be undermined if untransmitted television film of last month's Whitechapel riot in London is handed over to police, a court heard yesterday. Four television companies are opposing an application by the Crown Prosecution Service for surrender of the footage. The BBC, Independent Television News, London News Network and BSkyB - the satellite television venture in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a substantial stake - argued through counsel at Southwark Crown Court that the public interest would not be served by surrender of the material. Ms Susanna Fisher, for the television companies, told the court: 'Although we accept that it is in the public interest that material be produced so that the guilty are convicted . . . we say there is a competing public interest.' The disturbances erupted during a vigil on September 10 by more than 300 demonstrators outside the Royal London Hospital in Whitechapel, east London, where a Bengali teenager, who was attacked two days earlier by a gang of white youths, was on life-support. During the riot police were pelted with stones and other missiles. Ten people were arrested and 25 police officers were injured. Mr Jeremy Benson, for the Crown, told Judge Gerald Butler QC the police were seeking an order for the material to be handed over to them under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1989. Officers wanted to view footage which had not been screened to see if it contained evidence to help in the prosecution of those responsible. The judge will give his ruling on Monday.</p>

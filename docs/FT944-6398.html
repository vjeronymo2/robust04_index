			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / US calls for new Bosnia peace conference: Boutros Ghali to visit Sarajevo in 'critical high stakes' mission The US yesterday called for a new international conference to seek peace in Bosnia, as diplomatic contacts intensified in the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo. Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, said he would formally propose the new round of talks when ministers from the 'contact group' nations of the US, Russia, France, Germany and the UK meet in Brussels on Friday. Contact group envoys travelled to Bosnia yesterday for talks aimed at getting the warring sides to agree to come back to the bargaining table, while Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary general, also came to Sarajevo in a bid to salvage the battered credibility of his organisation. In what a UN official decribed as a 'critical, high- stakes' mission, Mr Boutros Ghali will meet Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic and Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and lay out the conditions for the continuation of the UN operation in Bosnia. He will try to broker a ceasefire in the war-torn territory, and, in particular, around Bihac, the north-western Moslem enclave, where infantry clashes yesterday were reported to the west of the UN 'safe area'. Mr Boutros Ghali is expected to meet an angry reception in Sarajevo, where many resent the UN's failure to lift the 32-month Serb siege. His last visit in December 1992 is remembered bitterly for his remarks that he could think of a dozen places even worse than Sarajevo. His visit coincides with intense diplomatic efforts to overcome deep splits in the international community over Bosnia and the peace process. In a bid to get the Bosnian Serbs to return to the bargaining table, meanwhile, envoys from the five-nation contact group yesterday also travelled to Sarajevo, for talks with the Moslem-led Bosnian govern ment. The representatives were also due to meet Bosnian Serb leaders for the first time since they rejected a western peace plan - a partition of Bosnia - in July. This meeting followed talks with President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia in Belgrade on Monday. The contact group has been split in recent days by sharp disagreements over policy, but the US has shifted its position towards that of its European allies in an effort to salvage Nato unity. The international mediators appear to hold out hope of reviving their peace plan to divide Bosnia roughly in half between the Moslem-Croat federation and the Bosnian Serbs, who control 70 per cent of the war-torn country. The peace process will get an additional boost when Serb rebels from Croatia sign an agreement on Thursday on restoring economic links with Zagreb, the Croat capital. A close associate of Mr Milosevic yesterday said Belgrade would maintain a direct link with Serb-held territory in Croatia, which would step up pressure on the Bosnian Serbs to sign a peace deal. But the Bosnian Serb leadership, which over the past two weeks has revelled in the eruption of a serious transatlantic feud over Bosnia, is waiting for territorial concessions. James Blitz adds: Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, highlighted the fears of European governments over the growing violence in Bosnia by raising the possibility that UN troops might have to be withdrawn from the region. Mr Major told MPs in the House of Commons that he had been angered by 'lurid and misplaced criticism' of Unprofor which had appeared in the US press in recent days. He said the protection forces in Bosnia were not a combat force and had not been equipped for such a role.</p>

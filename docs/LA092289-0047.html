			<p><P> September 22, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: SANTA MONICA  </P> <P> A romantic cocoon surrounds Ciel Bergman's newest paintings of huge irises.  They stand amid pink watery landscapes daubed with touches of color and swirls  of spinning line. Long horizontal canvases sliced by color into tall vertical  segments, they frequently make clever plays with space but lean dangerously  close to decorative sweetness.  </P> <P> What slows the drift into cloying affability is the artist's casual, assured  drawing and assertive elements like the dark and light circles in "Still and  Still Moving." On this canvas two pairs of orbs, white and black, red and  green, hover like strange mirrored moons above an alien yellow horizon. Solid  shapes and bold color are welcome anchors for form and meaning in the pastel  never-never land that haunts so many of these paintings.  </P> <P> Dennis Leon's plywood constructions are less dreamy, earthier landscapes. His  impressive "Rockface" sculptures are towering pseudo-mountain ranges or rounded  hunks of cliff face held together with screws and glue. Part stage-set  illusion, part straightforward materials, they improbably convey a sense of  dense mass as well as something of a painterly, tactile antiquity. Moving  around the two free-standing wood mountain forms is like walking through the  stacked space of a Chinese brush and ink landscape to touch the distant  mountains. (Dorothy Goldeen Gallery, 1547 9th St., to Oct. 9.). SUVAN GEER  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Editorial Report] Tokyo FNN Television Network in  Japanese at 2238 GMT on 25 June during its weekly "News 2001"  program, carries a live 19-minute interview with Yoshiro Mori,  Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) secretary general, by FNN  announcers Yuji Kuroiwa and Megumi Seki, political commentator  Kenichi Takemura, and Keio University Professor Yoshiaki  Kobayashi at the FNN studio in Tokyo.    When asked about the LDP's strategy for taking power and the  possibility of the LDP allying with the Social Democratic Party  of Japan (SDPJ), Mori says: "It is important for the LDP to  hold talks with various parties from now on. Although the LDP  does not intend to take an arrogant attitude, the fact is, that  although the LDP did not win a majority, it did win a large  number of votes in the (House of Representatives) election last  year. In this sense, it is very important to establish an  administration that reflects the people's will." Noting the LDP  has been making efforts to reform itself and that the party is  responsible for managing politics, Mori says: "We would like to  hold talks with various parties to seek their understanding."  He adds that the LDP may not start discussion with the  coalition immediately because of a 25 June meeting, during which  Komeito (Clean Government Party) Secretary General Ichikawa told  him that the coalition wanted to cautiously watch the situation  for the time being.    At 2242 GMT, Kuroiwa asks whether or not the LDP will put  forward party president Yohei Kono as a candidate for the next  prime minister. Mori replies: "As Mr. Kono is the LDP  president, our party intends to field him in the premiership  election. However, several cards will be revealed during talks  (with other parties). Even if the LDP insists on the LDP card,  others may not agree to it. In this case, it cannot be helped."  The program then shows a brief recorded comment by LDP member  Takeshi Noda, who stresses the need to establish an  administration headed by LDP President Kono. Mori says the best  thing for the LDP to do is to form an administration headed by  the LDP, and adds it is also important for the party to  participate in an administration. Asked about the possibility  of forming an LDP-SDPJ-Sakigake (Harbinger) coalition and the  possibility of Sakigake Representative Masayoshi Takemura  running for prime minister, Mori says: "One option is that  various parties will reach a consensus on a decision."  Reviewing the past LDP structure, Mori says the LDP is now  changing itself.    Asked whether the next administration will be a full-fledged  one or an interim one for dealing with the current situation,  Mori says: "We should not seek an interim administration." On  the possibility of the lower house's dissolution and a general  election, he says Mr. Hata's decision to resign (to avoid a  lower house dissolution) was right because a political vacuum  would affect the economy. He adds it is necessary to convene an  extraordinary Diet session this fall to enact political  reform-related bills, including the redistricting bill, to  further promote political reform.    At 2249 GMT, Takao Iwami, a MAINICHI SHIMBUN special  editorial adviser, phones in from a Shibuy hotel to give his  view on the LDP stance, stating the LDP lacks a strong eagerness  to take power.    At 2250 GMT, Kuroiwa points out the ambiguity of LDP  policies  toward taking power. Mori says: "I do not think there are  large differences among various parties on policies, especially  domestic affairs. It is important to leave room for discussions  with other parties." Discussing the consumption tax hike, Mori  says it is necessary to seek public understanding on the issue.  But, he adds: "I think the consumption tax hike should be  avoided at the present in view of the current economic  situation." He says it is necessary to promote administrative  reform by 2010, while working with our welfare policies.    The interview with Mori concludes at 2257 GMT.</p>

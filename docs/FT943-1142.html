			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Media Futures: Heart of the next consumer electronics thrust  -Louise Kehoe reports on C-Cube, developer of the core technology for CD video players When Japan's leading electronics companies launch their consumer video CD players in Tokyo next week, a small Silicon Valley semiconductor company will be cheering them on. JVC, Matsushita, Sony, Sharp and Denon are all customers of C-Cube Microsystems, developer of the core digital compression technology for this new generation of home video players, which promises to make the video cassette (tape) as old hat as LP records. C-Cube will supply a semiconductor chip that performs the critical task of decoding or decompressing the digital video data stored on a compact disc. Until now, such technology has been far more expensive or of lower performance than that of tapes. The C-Cube chip 'is the only extra logic device required to transform an audio CD player into a video CD player,' says Alexandre Balkanski, 34, who founded C-Cube six years ago. The incremental cost is only about Dollars 50, he adds. For the consumer electronics industry, the 'PlayCD' chip presents an opportunity to revive sagging profits. It is 11 years since the introduction of the audio CD, the last product to create a consumer electronics 'boom'. Now the audio CD player market is heavily saturated and prices have declined to the point where profit margins are thin. 'With just a small increment in technology, they have a whole new product,' says Balkanski. The Japanese companies are determined to make Video CD a success, he says, predicting sales of at least 1m units in the first 12 months. 'This is a red-hot product that will transform the home stereo into a multimedia entertainment system. This is the beginning of a whole new market.' Video CD players are designed to be hooked up to a television set, like a VCR, to play films, music videos or karaoke. The first Video CD players are expected to sell for about Dollars 250-Dollars 400. However, these products, which will make their debut in Japan next week, are aimed primarily at karaoke fans and devotees of music videos. They can be used to play full-length films, but the discs will each hold only about 70 minutes of video, so two discs are needed for a full-length feature film. The picture quality will be about the same as a video tape. It is the second wave of Video CD players, expected in about six months, that is creating high excitement among multimedia experts. With improved picture quality and the ability to cram a full-length film on to a single CD these 'movie players' could seriously challenge video tape players. Video CD players will not, however, be able to record TV programmes. Tapes and CDs will probably therefore co-exist for many years, just as today's audio systems typically include a CD player and cassette tape deck for recording. Few doubt, however, that the CD will soon become the medium of choice for pre-recorded video. 'The X-generation will love them,' says Rick Sizemore of Total Research in Multimedia, an Arizona market research firm. He projects sales of up to 1m Video CD players next year and 5m in 1996. The launch of the first consumer oriented Video CD players could rocket C-Cube's sales (Dollars 23.7m last year, and Dollars 18.6m in the first half of 1994) into a much higher orbit. The company, which raised Dollars 37.4m from an initial public offering in April, is beginning to attract Wall Street attention. Analysts are projecting net earnings per share of about 70 cents for 1995, on sales approaching Dollars 100m. 'We view C-Cube Microsystems as the purest and best near-term play on deployment of digital multimedia into many existing and yet-to-develop end markets,' analyst Alex Brown said in a recent report on the company. Currently, C-Cube has little competition in the emerging multimedia chip market, although the company expects that the 'big boys' of the semiconductor industry, including Motorola and the in-house chip operations of Japan's consumer electronics leaders, will soon be nipping at its heels. C-Cube subcontracts the fabrication of its products to other chip makers, including Texas Instruments, one of the largest in the US. The company says that it has no plans to invest in its own chip manufacturing facility, preferring to concentrate its resources on chip design. Even if Video CD does not take off as quickly as expected, C-Cube has other irons in the multimedia fire. The company has developed a video 'encoder' chip, used to compress video signals for digital satellite TV and cable TV transmission. It also provides chips for multimedia personal computer add-on circuit boards. C-Cube chips are also used in the Panasonic 3DO home video game machine, widely acclaimed for its superior graphics. The 3DO machines have been slow to catch on in the US, largely because they are more than twice as expensive as competing video game players from market leaders Nintendo and Sega. However, C-Cube's latest chip will significantly reduce the price difference, says Balkanski, giving manufacturers of 3DO machines an opportunity to become real challengers in the video game market. In the longer term, C-Cube hopes to supply chips for use in television 'set top boxes', the units that will link TVs to future interactive services. In this potentially very high volume market, C-Cube expects to face severe competition. But the company is not waiting for interactive TV to take off. The multimedia trend has already created big opportunities, Balkanski believes. 'While others are talking about the future potential, we will be printing money,' he says.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Kobe Steel, Ltd. has developed, together with  Menzolit GmbH of Germany, a process to produce unique  glassfiber-reinforced molded products having better appearance  and processability. Trial production is now being carried out on  the site of a Menzolit factory in Germany.    Kobe Steel and Menzolit have been in a tie-up since 1990 for  development of resin molding processes and related technology  mainly for auto parts. The German firm has been committed to  developing an intermediate material and the Japanese firm, a  heat-applied molding process, to complete the new process.    The intermediate material is in the form of a  cylinder--measuring 20cm in diameter and 15cm in length--made  from thermo-plastic resin powder such as polypropylene and from  glassfiber (6-25mm in length). The material is press-molded  (extruded) in an atmosphere of inert gas at the temperature  which is the melting point of the resin used.    The new extruder can heat the material uniformly so as not  to  deteriorate the resin on heating and not to break the  reinforcing fiber. Molding products made in this way are said to  have better appearance. This process is claimed to be most  suitable for producing parts with complex shapes and of uniform  strength.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Gennadiy Yezhov] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 17 TASS -- The amount of annual payments  made by Russia for servicing its external debt exceeds that paid  by the former Soviet Union to its foreign creditors. The  Russian Government has had to stop the issue of state guarantees  to the Western creditors who fund joint projects in Russia, Vice  Premier Aleksandr Shokhin, who is also economics minister,  announced at a press conference today.    The vice premier stressed that enterprises wishing to obtain  centralised credits, including from the package of Western  financial assistance to Russian market reforms will from now on  have to decide what property -- land, buildings or securities --  they can mortgage in case their project turns out to be  loss-making.    As concerns the insolvent debtors, under whose obligations  the Russian Government now has to pay in accordance with the  country's foreign commitments, the Cabinet of Ministers is now  working on a scheme of making them pay federal authorities,  including through the court of arbitration, Shokhin said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Correspondent Igor Chernov report: "President Has Right to </F> Vacation Too"]    [Text] Russian President Boris Yeltsin's two-week vacation  is coming to an end. As informed sources report, he plans to  fly to Moscow on Sunday afternoon. He is pleased with his  vacation and, but for the rumors about a coup in preparation  which are disturbing the capital, his mood would be perfectly  fine. Incidentally, this was helped by the weather -- it was  really warm in Sochi.    The president spent the second week of his vacation more  strenuously (I do not think this was done with the aim of  "demonstrating" his good health). He met with Prime Minister  Chernomyrdin, who flew down to discuss problems relating to the  economy and some foreign and domestic policy questions. The  meeting, as the prime minister told journalists, was not an  emergency meeting. Moreover, the president continued to be  briefed on the the state of affairs in the Kuban and flew by  helicopter, along with Krasnodar Kray Administration Head N.  Yegorov, over the Black Sea coast.    Yeltsin did not, course, forget to relax during his  vacation.  According to the Sochi Town Hall press service he made several  trips around the resort and did the local sights, while the  heliicopter trip with Yegorov, it emerged, pursued purely  sporting ends -- a duck shoot was held at Priazovskiye Plavni.    The president's wife, Naina Iosifovna, who visited Sochi's  House of Fashion and the Mini-Maxi Theater of Fashions last  Thursday, also imparted to journalists some details of Boris  Nikolayevich's life in the resort. According to her, the  president even took a dip in the sea (the temperature of the sea  water is nine degrees).    Aware that there are the Matsesta therapeutic waters in  Sochi, which all the country's past leaders have taken to  improve their health, journalists rushed to report that Boris  Yeltsin had also undergone a course of treatment there. But the  Matsesta complex' chief medical officer, A. Shvyrova, denied  this information was true: "Unfortunately, Boris Nikolayevich  did not visit us. If he had, we would certaintly have drawn  attention to our plight...."    During the president's two-week vacation only a film crew  from Ostankino managed to visit the dacha by the Bocharovo  brook. Your TRUD correspondent's press pass did not,  unfortunately, enable him to gain access to the estate. I was  courteously admitted to the guardroom, my details were taken  down..., and I was thanked for my concern. I had gone to the  checkpoint at the president's dacha to clarify the details of a  minor incident -- on Wednesday a group of Sochi inhabitants had  organized a picket at the gates.... Some people were demanding  an apartment from the president, others an increased pension,  someone else wanted the president to deal with the local mafia.  After holding their midday rally, the people went their  separate ways. There were no other excesses in Sochi.</p>

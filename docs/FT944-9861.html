			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Management: Pioneers and prophets - Alfred P Sloan Alfred P Sloan's (1875-1966) sole contribution to management literature is My Years at General Motors. Published in 1963, it is a one-paced, intricate account of how Sloan managed GM. Sloan was not an up-tempo evangelist with a pithy catch-phrase and a store of witty anecdotes, and yet the book is among the most important in management and Sloan one of the most influential managers of the century. 'His book is one thing, what he did at GM is quite another,' says London Business School's Sumantra Ghoshal. 'Sloan created a new organisational form  -the multi-divisional form - which became a doctrine of management. Today, it is not ascribed to him, but Sloan was its instigator.' Sloan became president of GM in 1923, chairman in 1946 and honorary chairman from 1956 until his death. When he took over, GM was struggling to hold its own as Ford, with its Model T, swept all aside. He set about revitalising and reorganising GM along 'federal' lines, the very antithesis of the way Ford organised itself. He replaced GM's messy, bureaucratic, centralised system with one based on divisions, each with its own clearly delineated responsibilities. More than 30 divisions, further divided into groups, emerged. Instead of fighting for dominance, separate functions were treated as equals. In the marketplace, GM's products - including Chevrolet and Cadillac - competed as separate divisions. Much of the current debate about being both local and global can be traced back to Sloan's delicate balancing act between the twin forces of decentralisation and centralisation. Sloan's triumph was in achieving a balance over so many years. The decentralised structure proved the making of GM. By the late 1970s its US market share was more than 45 per cent, compared with 12 per cent when Sloan took over in the 1920s. The federal structure meant that instead of concerning themselves with the nitty-gritty of production, executives could turn their energies to ensuring that divisions met their performance targets and to providing overall direction. GM's fortunes revived and Sloan began to meet his aim of providing a car for 'every purse and every purpose'. The new GM became venerated as a model of management. But troubles emerged with the multi-divisional system. It was built around a vast web of committees and groups which became bogged down in their own power struggles and bureaucracy. Stringent targets and narrow measures of success stultified initiative. Also, by the 1960s the delicate balance was lost - finance emerged as the dominant function - and GM became paralysed by what had once made it great. Even so, Sloan's legacy lives on - the multi-divisional organisation remains dominant; in the 1980s it was estimated that 85 per cent of large corporations had adopted the multi-divisional structure. Only now, says Ghoshal, is a new, more entrepreneurial, organisational model emerging to replace the world according to Sloan.</p>

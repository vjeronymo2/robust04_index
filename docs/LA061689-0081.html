			<p><P> June 16, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY;  </P> <P> COUNCIL DOESN'T BUDGE ON 'POLITICAL' CHANGES IN ARTS FUNDING  </P> <P> Despite an impassioned plea by the chairman of the Commission for Arts and  Culture, San Diego City Council tentatively refused Wednesday to amend the  "political" decisions of a council committee that denied funding for  avant-garde Installation Gallery and overturned the commission's action  blocking funding for a half dozen other groups. A final council vote will be  taken June 29.  </P> <P> Milton (Mickey) Fredman, chairman of the arts commission, passionately urged  the council to reconsider last month's Public Services and Safety Committee  vote and to stand, instead, behind criteria established this year for  allocating money to arts groups. The council committee added six groups to the  arts commission's funding list of about 70 organizations.  </P> <P> Fredman said that the commission had been established to end a politicized  approach to arts funding. Councilman Bruce Henderson acknowledged that the  Public Services and Safety Committee vote to fund groups such as the African  American Museum was "a political decision."  </P> <P> Fredman said it was unfair to the organizations that followed the criteria to  fund other groups that successfully lobbied the City Council.  </P> <P> "Organizations which followed the criteria are now put in an uneven position by  the organizations that didn't follow the criteria," Fredman said.  </P> <P> "We went out to the arts community, and 90% said fine, we'll do it. Ten percent  said to hell with you. We'll go to the council who have friends on our boards."  When asked, however, Fredman did not name the organizations he claimed had  lobbied City Council.  </P> <P> Fredman agreed that the six institutions recommended for funding by the Public  Services and Safety Committee were all deserving. He suggested a compromise in  which those groups -- including the newly organized African American Museum,  the Automotive Museum, the Reuben H. Fleet Space Theater, the Maritime Museum,  the San Diego Inter-Museum Promotion Council and the Westgate Mainly Mozart  Festival -- be funded a small amount this year but compete for substantial  increases in 1990, when an additional $2 million will be added to the  commission's current $5.28-million allocations budget.  </P> <P> Although Mayor Maureen O'Connor called for further study by the city manager's  office, the City Council closed ranks and pointedly reminded members of the  fledgling arts commission that they were advisers only, and that the council  members make the decisions.  </P> <P> Fredman acknowledged that Installation Gallery had suffered financial  difficulties, including a reportedly $6,000 debt, but claimed "it is not fair  to take a nine-year organization and cut them down to nothing." At issue is a  proposed grant of $42,000.  </P> <P> Councilwoman Judy McCarty disagreed, saying, "Installation did not meet my  criteria."  </P> <P> "We have a problem with Installation because we funded them last year and they  weren't able to get through the fiscal year," McCarty later explained. "If (the  gallery) can't win support of San Diegans, why are we giving them support?  </P> <P> "You know, when a politician is not able to raise money for a campaign, it's  because they don't appeal to the people. I guess artists are the same way. If  they're not able to raise money, they can't convince people they're any good,"  she said.  </P> <P> In a related matter, the city manager's office recommended reducing the arts  commission's administrative budget by $127,000 to pay for part of the  additional $346,000 approved by the Public Services and Safety Committee. The  remainder is to be paid from the city's funds for downtown maintenance.  </P> <P> If the cut is approved, the position of public arts administrator would remain  vacant until fall, said the commission's executive director, Victoria Hamilton.  </P></p>

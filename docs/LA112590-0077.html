			<p><P> November 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP EYE  </P> <P> EAGLES NEST EGGS: As we predicted earlier this year, the Eagles have gotten  back together and are working on a greatest-hits package. In fact, original  members Don Henley, Joe Walsh, Timothy B. Schmit and Don Felder have been in a  Los Angeles studio recording several new songs for possible inclusion on the  album.  </P> <P> Who's missing from that list? None other than Glenn Frey, who didn't show up  for the recent sessions. Has Frey had another falling out with Henley? Can the  band pull off its much-anticipated 1991 reunion tour without Frey on board?  Stay tuned. The band is scheduled to have another recording session in  mid-December. Insiders say if Frey doesn't make an appearance, it could spell  trouble for any reunion tour.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Slovak Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar indicated that  he would strive for the dismissal of Deputy Prime Minister Roman  Kovac and Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik. He did not rule out  that he would link the voting on the privatization bill to the  vote of confidence in the government. Kovac and Moravcik, who  head the alternative platform within the ruling Movement for a  Democratic Slovakia [HZDS], proposed to form a new government in  which opposition parties would also participate. However, it  would be a government without Meciar. The prime minister also  claimed that, of the 10 HZDS deputies who joined the Alternative  of Political Realism, not all of them would vote for voicing no  confidence in his government.    Speaking about the Alternative's proposal regarding a broad  coalition government without political leaders, he remarked that  the real purpose of this was to remove political leaders from  the government coalition between the HZDS and the Slovak  National Party. Meciar said that a broad coalition would not  last because the parties would be bound together only by  material interest.</p>

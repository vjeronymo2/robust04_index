			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / UK Company News: Littlewoods scores 2% rise to Pounds 97m LITTLEWOODS, the retailing and football pools chain owned by the Moores family, last year succeeded in shrugging off the worst effects of the recession by reporting a 2 per cent improvement in pre-tax profits. But the company sharply deflated repeated speculation that it might seek a public listing. 'The family very much wish to retain their private company status,' said Mr Leonard van Geest, chairman. Mr Desmond Pitcher, chief executive, said it was too early to tell what effect the government's plans to create a national lottery might have upon Littlewoods' pools business. But he said some 'absurd' figures had been bandied about for how much it might raise and pointed out that Littlewoods already contributed Pounds 400m annually to various sporting and arts foundations. In 1991 Littlewoods' pre-tax profits advanced from Pounds 94.8m to Pounds 97m as turnover grew strongly from Pounds 2.37bn to Pounds 2.59bn. The company's star performer was its home shopping division, which lifted profits from Pounds 53.5m to Pounds 56m as it expanded its agency network by 200,000 to more than 3m. Littlewoods had been seeking to sell the home shopping business to raise funds for the expansion of its other retail interests but decided to take it off the market earlier this month after it received no suitable offers. The company's 124 chain stores increased profits from Pounds 29.4m to Pounds 30.3m. Its chain of 117 Index catalogue stores is expected to be profitable in the current year after sustaining losses for several years. In 1991 Index lost Pounds 3.7m, a reduction on the Pounds 6.7m deficit recorded in the previous year. Littlewoods said it had met with an encouraging response from the two stores it opened last year in St Petersburg. The rouble-currency store had traded successfully, creating a non-remittable surplus of Pounds 1m which will be reinvested in further growth should the opportunities arise. The company is investigating opening another four stores. Its hard currency store traded less well because of the scarcity of convertible currency in Russia. The company is also expanding its Littlewoods International business with the aim of buying goods in south-east Asia and wholesaling them to other retailers in Europe and North America. The company's 32 family shareholders, who are all direct descendants of the two founders, shared about Pounds 400,000 in dividends. Littlewoods paid out a further Pounds 1m to its preference shareholders. Mr Pitcher said he was not a great enthusiast about the state of the economy. The current year had started well but March had been 'awful' because of the uncertainty ahead of the election.</p>

			<p><P> July 13, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> LIMITS ON HILLSIDE DENSITY GET INITIAL OK;  </P> <P> EAST VALLEY: THE PLANNING COMMISSION MOVES TO PROTECT THOUSANDS OF ACRES FROM  TUJUNGA TO LAKE VIEW TERRACE.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Planning Commission gave tentative approval Thursday to a  massive rezoning proposal aimed at barring dense development from 6,600 acres  of mountainous land in the east San Fernando Valley.  </P> <P> "I do feel there needs to be some part of Los Angeles that preserves its  country atmosphere," said Commissioner Fernando Torres.  </P> <P> The proposal, initiated two years ago by Councilman Joel Wachs, is intended to  protect hillsides in the communities of Lake View Terrace, Shadow Hills,  Sunland, Sun Valley and Tujunga, said city planner Edward M. Barr.  </P> <P> It reduces the zoning classification of undeveloped areas in the Verdugo Hills  that have natural slopes of 15% or more to minimum density, restricting  development to no more than one single-family house per acre.  </P> <P> It places in jeopardy at least 15 proposed subdivisions ranging in size from  six units to a 119-unit project by developer Dale Poe. The areas now are zoned  for denser single- and multiple-family housing.  </P> <P> Planning commissioners approved the proposal by a 4-0 vote after a public  hearing attended by about 100 residents that lasted more than three hours. More  than 300 people attended a previous hearing in April.  </P> <P> The proposal will come back to the commission in two weeks after the planning  staff re-examines the 15 subdivisions to determine whether they should be  included in the new zone. It must then be approved by the City Council's Land  Use and Planning Committee and the full City Council.  </P> <P> Speakers at Thursday's hearing were about evenly divided.  </P> <P> Those who favored the proposal said the area is the largest undeveloped piece  of land in Los Angeles and should be afforded the same protection as hillside  areas in Sherman Oaks and other more affluent communities.  </P> <P> "We moved here because of the country atmosphere," said Shadow Hills resident  Wesley Nutten. "We'd like it to stay that way."  </P> <P> "There are very few mountains left in Los Angeles," said resident Bill Eick of  Sun Valley. "All we're asking is that we be treated the same as the rest of Los  Angeles."  </P> <P> "Any proposal that limits development is welcome," said Lake View Terrace  resident Margarita Allen.  </P> <P> Several speakers said they do not want to see the area become "Glendale West."  Lewis Snow, president of the Lake View Terrace Home Owners Assn., said  homeowners in the east Valley are trying "to prevent the Glendale-ization of  our hillsides."  </P> <P> They said Glendale has allowed its hillsides to become cluttered with houses.  </P> <P> Though the proposal may seem extreme to some, Snow said, "We would rather err  on the side of caution and protect the hillsides."  </P> <P> Those opposed to rezoning said the city would be violating property owners  rights and depriving moderate income people of housing.  </P> <P> The plan protects "a few at the expense of many," said Lucy Metcalf of La  Crescenta, who owns property in the area. "This is taking private property for  public use."  </P> <P> Judith Spencer of Sunland called the plan "too severe. It will curb a healthy  growth situation."  </P> <P> "This will have a dramatic effect on the community by virtually eliminating  single-family housing," said builder Chris Richman of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Several speakers said that only multimillionaires will be able to afford new  homes in the area if it is rezoned.  </P> <P> "Porter Ranch has 3,500 homes," said Paul Fise of Sun Valley, referring to a  $2-billion development plan for the Chatsworth Hills approved by the City  Council early this week. "That should take care of our additional housing needs  in the San Fernando Valley for some years to come," reducing the need to  develop hillsides in the East Valley, he said.  </P> <P> Torres said he normally supports plans that call for increasing the housing  supply, but that in this case he believes the mountains should be preserved.  </P> <P> "This is long overdue," said Commissioner Suzette Neiman.  </P></p>

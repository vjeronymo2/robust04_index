The Australian Foreign  Ministry is paying attention to the fact that North Korea has  contacted Australia while the DPRK's discussions with the United  States and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) are  coming to their final stages.    Australia and North Korea established diplomatic ties in  1974. Relations between the two countries were ruptured because  North Korea had one-sidedly closed its embassy in Australia and  deported Australian diplomats from North Korea.    According to an Australian Foreign Ministry spokesman and  diplomatic sources in Australia, North Korea took the initiative  in contacting Australia and high-level diplomats of both  countries held meetings at Australian embassies in Bangkok and  Jakarta between late last month and early this month.    In the meetings, it is said that North Korea called for  normalization of diplomatic ties and that Australia, as a  condition for normalizing diplomatic ties, demanded that North  Korea accept nuclear inspections by an international  organization and that it promote discussions with the United  States and the ROK. Australia says it informed Japan, the  United States and the ROK about details of the meetings.    In the past, Australia and North Korea promoted partial  diplomatic exchanges in Beijing and other places.</p>

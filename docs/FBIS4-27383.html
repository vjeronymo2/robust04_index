			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 1 (YONHAP) -- While President Kim  Yong-sam is away from the country on state visits to Russia and  Uzbekistan from June 1-7, Chongwadae [presidential offices], the  Office of the Prime Minister and the Foreign, Home and Defense  Ministries are prepared for any emergency.    Because the president is abroad when the North Korean  nuclear  dispute is facing a critical moment, these national security-  and public order-related agencies are on alert against anything  that might happen during his absence.    Tension on the Korean peninsula is mounting as the UN  Security Council has taken up the nuclear issue. Concerned  about this development, President Kim instructed  security-related ministers to prepare fully for any abrupt North  Korean action in a meeting he himself presided over Sunday. On  Monday, he invited Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok, Economic Planning  Minister Chong Chae-sok and National Unification Minister Yi  Hong-ku to breakfast at Chongwadae and told them to preserve  national security and public order during his absence.    Stressing that the row over Pyongyang's nuclear program is  entering a critical phase, Kim said the government should remain  on around-the-clock alert so that South Koreans can go about  their business without feeling a sense of crisis. He also  called for all- out efforts to prevent major accidents.    Prime minister Yi, giving a briefing on the cabinet's  determination to hold the fort during the president's absence,  said all cabinet members would fully support Kim's summit  diplomacy in Russia and Uzbekistan by maintaining national  security and public order and taking all possible precautions  against accidents.    On Monday morning, President Kim called President Bill  Clinton, who was about to fly to Europe to attend ceremonies  marking the 50th anniversary of the Normandy invasion, to ensure  close Korea-U.S. cooperation in dealing with the North Korean  nuclear issue and to explain about his trip to Russia and  Uzbekistan.    The hot-line conversation with Clinton ended Kim's official  schedule prior to his departure for Moscow on Wednesday.    On Monday afternoon, Kim personally checked the agenda for  his summit with Russian President Boris Yeltsin and the speeches  he is to make in Russia and Uzbekistan.    Chongwadae virtually adopted an emergency stance under Chief  of Staff Pak Kwan-yong's control Monday.    As Senior Foreign Affairs and Security Secretary Chong  Chong-uk, Senior Economic Secretary Pak Chae-yun, Senior Press  Secretary Chu Ton-sik and Senior Administrative Secretary Hong  In-kil are to accompany the president to Russia and Uzbekistan,  all remaining senior secretaries -- Chief Secretary Pak  Kwan-yong, Senior Political Secretary Yi Won-chong, Senior  Government Affairs Secretary Yi Ui-kun, Senior  Petition-Information Secretary Kim Yong- su and Senior  Education-Culture Secretary Kim Chong-nam -- will take turns  serving as Chongwadae duty officer.    Chongwadae is also maintaining around-the-clock  communication  with the traveling president.    Prime Minister Yi is in charge of state affairs during the  president's absence, and this is his first experience as prime  minister. His office is thus prepared to help Yi carry out his  duties during the president's absence by maintaining close  cooperation with Chongwadae and national security-related  agencies.    The Foreign Ministry is working 24 hours a day under Vice  Minister Pak Kun-u, as Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu is a member  of the president's entourage.    The Home and Defense Ministries implemented an emergency  work  system Wednesday, while the armed forces are on high alert to  increase surveillance of North Korea's military movements.    The police have strengthened their posture against crime  nationwide to maintain law and order while the president is away.</p>

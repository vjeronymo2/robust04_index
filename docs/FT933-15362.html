			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Report on WDA highlights a conflict THE DAMNING report yesterday by the Commons public accounts committee on the management of the Welsh Development Agency highlights a potential conflict in its role: to be a fully-accountable public body while seeking to promote Wales and attract inward investment with entrepreneurial flair. The appointment in 1988 of the businessman Dr Gwyn Jones, who was chairman until last week and for much of the period covered by the MPs' report, put the emphasis on the latter. While he flew around the world attracting business, the internal management, headed since early 1991 by Mr Philip Head as chief executive, appeared insufficiently willing to exercise what it might have regarded as bureaucratic controls. Mr Head had succeeded Mr David Waterstone, who had left the previous summer to work in industry. Neither the Welsh Office nor the government-appointed non-executive directors, were effective in stamping out the practices condemned by the MPs. The investigation by the committee, chaired by Mr Robert Sheldon, Labour MP for Ashton under Lyne, followed concerns raised by the National Audit Office on the WDA's 1991-92 accounts. The committee's main criticisms are: The agency failed to follow a 'clear legal requirement' to seek Welsh Office approval for a redundancy scheme between 1989 and 1992, which led to an overpayment of Pounds 1.4m. The Welsh Office is criticised for providing grant for the scheme without realising that approval had not been sought. The MPs accuse the agency of seeking to buy the silence of its international director Mr Michael Price, who left in February 1992 with an early retirement package valued by the committee at more than Pounds 228,000. They are also concerned by Operation Wizard, in which fees of Pounds 308,000 were paid to consultants over three years to consider possible privatisation. The MPs say there might have been a deliberate attempt by the agency to conceal the costs by spreading them under several headings in its accounts. The committee is also disturbed by the appointment in 1989 of an American, Mr Raymond Carignan, as a consultant to lead the agency's US operations. As a result of what are described as inadequate contractual and supervisory arrangements, Mr Carignan departed in 1991 with office furniture and equipment which cost Pounds 53,000. An even more unfortunate appointment in 1991 was that of a marketing director, Mr Neil Smith, a fraudster whose bogus credentials were not checked. Mr Smith is now in prison. 'He was able to breach internal financial regulations, including engaging models for promotional work in an unacceptable manner,' the report says. Mr Smith held interviews in a hotel room. The MPs also criticise the agency's failure to seek Welsh Office approval in 1984 for allowing senior officials to have free petrol for their private use. This scheme was stopped in April 1992. Dr Jones is personally criticised for a delay in notifying a change of use at rural premises for which he had received a grant. 'It is clearly important,' the report says, 'that circumstances do not arise which can give cause to any allegations of abuse of position.' The MPs, referring to 'the high standards expected of those who handle public finance', recommended that the Treasury and the Welsh Office 'take urgent steps to ensure that problems similar to those covered by this report do not recur, and that the lessons which have been learned are notified to and applied by all non-departmental public bodies.'

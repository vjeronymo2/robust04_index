			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by T. Garmize: "Reform Will Not Be the Shock </F> Kind--Promises Deputy Social Protection Minister Pavel  Kaminskiy"]    [Text] The squabble on the pages of the mass media is mild,  but the complaints against one another are serious--this is the  way the relationships that developed last week can be  characterized, but the question concerns only this temporary  segment, between the Pension Fund of the Russian Federation and  the Ministry of Social Protection of the Population. The  publication by some newspapers on 11 and 12 April of information  about an increase in the scale of pensions of separate  categories of pensioners starting 1 May, based on the data of  Saturday's news conference at the Ministry of Social Protection  of the Population, evoked an immediate "refutation" on the part  of the [Pension] Fund. But already on Wednesday, 13 April, the  ministry came out with a denunciation of the Fund's announcement  and with government guarantees.    Interested readers have very likely already become familiar  with the text of this announcement and the arguments of the  ministry on the pages of MOSKOVSKAYA PRAVDA. Without a doubt  they have also read the specifically addressed advances: To  whom, when, and to what extent earnings from which the pensions  are calculated will be recounted. But although it is infinitely  important today and tomorrow, a pension does not exhaust either  the depth of the problem of pension security as a whole, or,  what is more, urgent reforms in this sphere in the more distant  future.    Meanwhile, confusion, turmoil, and other unpleasant  consequences of haste accompany even the most charitable cause  in our country--social protection of the population. Subsidies,  indexation, the right to benefits, and nullification or changes  in such rights follow one after the other like ball lightning on  a graph, and with the same speed. Social security people are  unable to calculate, and pensioners and persons with privileges  are unable to grasp the text; therefore, they do not tire of  complaining. Thus, the taste of victory perhaps goes to Hershey  Cola, and not to the state, which is really continuously  indexing the scales of pensions and benefits from a meager  budget (the reasons for its meagerness are a separate  discussion).    It is pleasant to report to the readers that the drawback of  haste, it seems, is understood in higher governmental echelons.  And although, to use army vocabulary, it is still far from an  ideal societal structure, no "all hands on deck" jobs and false  alarms are expected in the near future in the cause of social  protection. Evidence of this is at least the order of priority  of the recalculations of earnings from which pensions are  estimated. The oldest pensions are subject to recalculation  first of all, at least for the purpose of correcting mistakes  committed in determining the scale of coefficients in bringing  "old" wages up to date.    Sociological forecasts even in our society, given the  conscientious approach to their compilation, are beginning to  gain respect and enjoy serious attention. In speaking about  forecasts of this type in relation to the need to change pension  legislation, recognition should be given to their futurological  value especially. One of the main reasons for reform, for  example, is the very complicated, to put it mildly, demographic  situation in the country. No offense intended, it is simply a  reality: Today there are 360 pensioners and about 400 other  social dependents for each 1,000 workers. Until the years  2000-2003, the increase in the proportion of pensioners will be  insignificant. But by 2010 such a sharp worsening of the  demographic situation is forecast that from 2015-2020 the  establishment of a new age pension standard is practically  inevitable. The ministry, of course, did not set, nor will it  ever set, the task of a barbarous, rapid destruction of the  system that has developed. But there is a program that was  stringently calculated and reasoned out, and it has to be  implemented.    It is not necessary to be a Solomon to estimate how the  demographic burden will grow on the workers of the 21st century;  moreover, a burden not on some kind of Martians, but on today's  youngsters. "We hope society will understand us." Commendable  foresight. After all, all these liberalizations cause the  confusion that literally manna is being strewn from heaven...but  on unprepared soil. Well, that is what the harvest is like, from  the "pot revolt," to putsches, to the results of elections.    Social policy is a system of two communicating vessels.  Under  current conditions there can be no question of any kind of  smooth transition of time. On the contrary, at least the  demographic elderly burden table in some countries of the world  in 1990, which was presented for review by journalists,  guarantees a seething of passions. The column "Russia," with its  colossal dubious leadership in this respect, is higher than the  United States, the Netherlands, and Spain together with France.  And this, you will note, is in the year 1990! But given the  birthrate in 1992-1993... It appears we will not cede first  place to anyone for a long time yet.    Of course, we have heard enough about the reasons for  longevity and, as a consequence, the possibility of "prolonged  success in the work" of our Western intellectual fellow-beings  The ecology, the quality and accessibility of food products,  relaxation, everyday amenities... To this, which, by the way, is  his own personal reminder, Kaminskiy is ready "to throw up his  hands..." But to assert such a significant state of affairs in  the country and "to drop one's hands" when the state of affairs  is corrected is incompatible. Thus, now is also exactly the time  to reason out a smooth transition to a new age qualification, to  the retention of justifiable benefits, including age benefits,  when going on pension, and the proportion of pensions and wages  of working pensioners. And what is more, without draconian  measures, and in accordance with common sense and public opinion.    Incidentally, public opinion right now does not diverge from  common sense with respect to the tendency of the minimum and  maximum scales to come closer together. It is now 1:4, but  sociologists fear a proportion of 1:2, which for the many who  have worked years longer than required for the assignment of a  pension, or who were stuck in harmful production, is really  unacceptable. What is more, no one plans to cancel compensation  payments, and, in addition, the current indexation keeps them at  a scale of 19,000 rubles [R]. As for the proportion, the  ministry is inclined to a ratio of 1:3. But for the present,  according to a statement by P. Kaminskiy, the minimum wage,  which has remained unchanged for a rather long time, does not  allow him to "change" the scale of recalculations. Thus the  minimum pension today of R34,000 (with compensations) is really  going nose to nose with the maximum...    Seasonal troubles have also not been ignored--camp vouchers  for orphaned children, invalids since childhood, and children  from poor and large families. According to a decree of the  government of 4 April, parents pay only 10 percent of their  cost, and the rest is handled by social insurance, trade unions,  and local funds for protection of the population. Vouchers for  invalid children from incomplete families and orphans are even  cheaper.    The attitude toward pension funds was expressed. There  should  be no objection, of course, to nonstate, supplementary forms of  protection of the population. The ministry even held a seminar  with the participation of representatives of almost 160 funds  that underwent expert analysis in this ministry. At the same  time, concern was caused by the promises of some funds of  guarantees that were almost state guarantees, which does not  correspond to reality! But, Kaminskiy repeated, these are  nonstate funds, and there can be no question of state guarantees  for fund obligations.    Public opinion causes, accompanies, and mutually also helps  or preserves any reform. The pension fund, like no other, must  be optimally reasonable in order that old people and newborns  can nevertheless survive together with all of society under  conditions of changes that for us are necessary and perhaps even  historic.</p>

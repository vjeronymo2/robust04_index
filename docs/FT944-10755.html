			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / International Company News: Currency influences restrict growth at Elan Corporation Elan Corporation, the Irish-based drugs company 75 per cent owned by US investors, reported pre-tax profits of IPounds 19.8m (Pounds 19.5m) for the six months to September 30. The interim results last time showed a loss of IPounds 69m but included a write-off of IPounds 85m for goodwill when Elan acquired Drug Research Corporation. Excluding the write-off, profit before tax amounted to IPounds 16m. Turnover rose from IPounds 50m to IPounds 59m. Manufacturing and distribution income was flat at IPounds 29m as an 8 per cent increase in sales was offset by the strengthening of the punt against the dollar. The main market for Elan's products is the US, which accounts for more than 50 per cent of sales. The group's main product is the range of hypertension and angina drugs known as the Cardizem family, which are projected to have sales of approximately Dollars 900m (Pounds 550m) in the US and Canada this year, according to Mr Tom Lynch, the chief financial officer. The drugs are made under licence by Marion Merrell Dow and Elan takes 5 per cent of sales. Royalty income fell from IPounds 10m to IPounds 8m, also the result of currency influences. Contract development income increased from IPounds 7m to IPounds 11m, representing an increased contribution from Advanced Therapeutic Systems, a research affiliate. Earnings per share were 55p compared with losses of 206p. Earnings before the exceptional charge amounted to 45p. The group is maintaining its policy of not paying dividends at the interim stage.</p>

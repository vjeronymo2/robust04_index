			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Norwegian Election: EC issue sways Norway vote - Labour party set to remain in power as minority government NORWAY'S Labour party last night tightened its hold on power as a minority government after increasing its vote in the general election. But with 89 per cent of the votes counted, results also showed strong resistance to Norway's application to join the European Community, signalling a big problem for Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, prime minister, as she seeks to turn public opinion in favour of membership. The most spectacular gains in the election yesterday were made by the agrarian Centre party, which based its campaign on uncompromising opposition to the EC. Computer projections showed the party, led by Ms Anne Enger Lahnstein, more than doubling its vote and overtaking the Conservative party as the largest opposition group in the 165-member Storting (parliament). The projections showed the Centre party, which won 11 seats in the last election in 1989, increased its representation to 31, its best-ever result, with 19 per cent of the vote. The Conservatives, meanwhile, suffered their worst setback for 20 years, losing nine of 37 seats, with 15 per cent of the vote. The right-wing Progress party, which supports EC membership, fell sharply and was set to lose half its 22 seats. 'This is a demand from the people that we continue the fight against EC membership,' said Ms Lahnstein, popularly known as the 'No Queen'. Labour, with 37 per cent of the vote, was projected to win 67 seats, a gain of four, due mainly to an improving economy and insistence that EC membership will be decided by a referendum, not the election. Mrs Brundtland said before the poll she would seek support on most issues except the EC from the Socialist Left party or the Centre party. The Socialist Left, which is anti-EC, was projected as losing four seats, to hold 13. Final results were expected to be delayed because of a breakdown in the computerised voting system in Oslo. Officials said a count from the capital would not be completed until later today at the earliest, and another vote might have to be called. A senior Labour leader said a clear anti-EC result in the election would harden the government's already tough stance in accession negotiations with the Community begun earlier this year, particularly over the sensitive issues of fishing and oil.</p>

			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INCENTIVE-BASED RATE PLAN TAKES PHASED APPROACH  </P> <P> The California Public Utilities Commission is expected this month to adopt an  incentive-based system for regulating Pacific Bell and GTE California. As  proposed, effective Jan. 1, the system would:  </P> <P> * Cut phone rates next year and then peg them in future years to a  cost-adjustment formula. This formula would limit price increases to the rate  of overall inflation minus 4% for assumed efficiencies due to cost-cutting and  labor-saving technology. Thus, in a year in which the cost of living increased  5%, telephone prices should rise no more than 1%. If inflation rose less than  4%, phone prices would actually be cut.  </P> <P> * Reorganize regulation so that the PUC still would set rates for basic phone  service, which on the local level remains a monopoly. Prices for most optional  calling features would be capped, but the companies would be allowed to lower  charges, within limits, if they wished to encourage usage. Prices would be  deregulated for such services as yellow pages advertising where competitive  alternatives already exist.  </P> <P> * Authorize the PUC, as part of its rate-setting procedure, to establish a  target rate of return for the phone companies. For 1990, that rate would be  11.75%. As an incentive to improve efficiency, the companies could keep all  profits for another percentage point, but earnings in excess of 12.75% would be  split evenly between customers and the company. Earnings exceeding a 16.75%  return would be refunded. For phone customers, the refunds would come as  credits in future bills.  </P> <P> In a final phase of the regulatory revision to be completed next year, the  proposal calls for the commission to revise all telephone rates to reflect the  new system. This "rate design" phase would eliminate the bewildering array of  credits and surcharges applied to customers bills. At that time, the proposal  recommends that the PUC scrap a 20-year-old $1.20 monthly fee for "Touch Tone"  service and also expand the local service area in which unlimited calls can be  made at no extra charge from 8 miles to 12 miles.

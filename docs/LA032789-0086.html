			<p><P> March 27, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFS: FIRE DAMPENS SERVICE  </P> <P> The Devonshire Christian Church in Mission Hills held its traditional Easter  services Sunday morning, despite an early morning fire that caused $30,000 in  damage to the church structure and $5,000 in damage to its contents, a Los  Angeles Fire Department spokesman said. The damage was limited mostly to the  church's offices but the sanctuary was damaged by water and smelled like smoke.  Fire Capt. Vince Cardinale of the department's Mission Hills station took his  entire 10-member crew to the church to help it prepare for services. "Most of  the church area itself was in pretty good shape," he said. A Fire Department  spokesman said the fire was caused by electrical problems in the structure's  attic.  </P></p>

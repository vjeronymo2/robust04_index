			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / Soviet atomic materials on sale Businessmen in the former Soviet Union have offered to sell heavy water, which can be used to make atomic bombs, to a Norwegian company, Norway's foreign ministry said yesterday, Reuter reports from Oslo. It is not illegal for a Norwegian company to purchase heavy water (deuterium oxide) but all exports and help to negotiate sales are forbidden. The ministry said Norway was probably a transit country for heavy water exports. Meanwhile, a Russian minister promised yesterday to tighten border controls after two citizens were caught trying to sell 1.2 kg of low-grade uranium in Germany.</p>

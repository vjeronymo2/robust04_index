			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / Rifkind challenged over Trident MR MALCOLM RIFKIND, the defence secretary, is being challenged to explain why his ministry is considering proposals that were previously rejected as unacceptable for refitting Trident submarines. The Scottish Council Development and Industry said Mr Rifkind must explain why lower standards of nuclear safety in refitting Trident may now be acceptable. The body, which lobbies for economic development in Scotland, also wants to know why the matter is being decided before consulting the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate. The government will decide in the next few weeks whether work on refitting Trident should be carried out at Rosyth, Fife, as was decided in 1986, or at Devonport in Plymouth. The Babcock Thorn consortium which manages Rosyth fears that if it loses the Trident contract the yard, which employs 4,200 people, would close within a few years. The contest appears to be between a proposal by Devonport to convert existing docks into a Trident refitting facility at a cost of Pounds 130m and a similar project at Rosyth which would cost Pounds 147m. A total of Pounds 120m has already been spent at Rosyth on building a brand new facility to refit Trident. But in December Babcock Thorn submitted a proposal based instead on refurbishing battleship docks, which the company believes is being considered by the MoD on an equal footing with Devonport's scheme. Babcock Thorn says that when it suggested a refurbishment scheme in 1991 the plan was rejected by the Ministry of Defence in favour of the Pounds 267m new-build project. The development body said: 'Either the original specification had unnecessarily high requirements, or increased risks to safety and operational efficiency are now being accepted as cost savings.' It said the government should explain why lower safety standards may be accepted, especially for Devonport where many more people live in the nuclear emergency evacuation zone than at Rosyth. 'It cannot be wise for government to depart from its original specification for a nuclear installation without a full explanation,' the development body added. Babcock Thorn had earlier feared that it was not being given a fair hearing and that Mr Rifkind had already recommended in favour of Devonport's proposal. A decision on the issue is not expected before next week at the earliest.</p>

"That's the man  that killed my husband."  </P> <P> At several points during her 90 minutes on the stand, the woman reiterated that  she is certain that Ramirez is the man who broke into her three-bedroom house  just before dawn on July 20, 1985.  </P> <P> She was the fifth prosecution witness to identify Ramirez as the so-called  Night Stalker. He is on trial for 13 murders and 30 other felonies in a string  of night-time residential attacks throughout Los Angeles County, mostly in the  spring and summer of 1985.  </P> <P> The woman said Ramirez also beat up her 8-year-old son, but did not bother the  couple's 2-year-old daughter, who slept through the attack.  </P></p>

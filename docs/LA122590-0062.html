			<p><P> December 25, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONE EN-CHANTED CHRISTMAS EVE;  </P> <P> AT ST. MICHAEL'S ABBEY, MIDNIGHT MASS IS SUNG IN BOTH LATIN AND GREGORIAN CHANT  </P> <P> Don't talk to the guys at St. Michael's Abbey about the old standards. Don't  bring up the Cole Porter chestnuts or the Irving Berlin ditties or the Gershwin  tunes if you want to impress them with your knowledge of music in the old days.  It won't work.  </P> <P> To the priests and seminarians at the abbey, Mozart might as well have been a  rapper. They deal each day in music that was new when the Chinese were using  printing presses for the first time: Gregorian chant.  </P> <P> They sing unto the Lord an old song.  </P> <P> They belong to the small Roman Catholic community of priests known as  Norbertines, an order founded in France in 1121 by St. Norbert and that  flourished in later centuries in Hungary. St. Michael's is the headquarters of  one of only three Norbertine communities in the United States, and it is the  only Catholic seminary in Orange County.  </P> <P> It is also one of the few places you can hear the Mass sung not only in Latin,  but in Gregorian chant. The performance of chant as part of the liturgy is the  cornerstone of the Norbertine order.  </P> <P> The priests of the abbey teach at St. Michael's Prep School (which is on the  grounds of the abbey north of El Toro), as well as at Santa Margarita and Mater  Dei high schools, and they work at various Orange County parishes on weekends.  But "our main purpose is to sing the liturgy -- what we call the divine  office," said Father Philip Smith, the abbey's music director.  </P> <P> "The liturgy is the focal point of our lives, and Christmas is the  personification of that because we have a beautiful midnight Mass preceded by  Christmas carols and midnight Matins."  </P> <P> Word gets around. The abbey's church routinely is filled to capacity for the  midnight Mass on Christmas Eve. People from throughout the county come to hear  the choir of 20 seminarians sing the ancient unison songs developed by Pope  Gregory I in the 6th Century. For most of the seminarians, that night is about  as close to show business as they'll get.  </P> <P> "There is a bit of show biz," said Darrin Merlino, a postulant, or begining  seminary student, from Huntington Beach. "For some reason, we always seem to  sound better when there's a group out there watching us. But overall, it's  pointed toward Christ.  </P> <P> "I never really did anything musically before I came here, and it's exciting  being an active member and singing rather than just listening. You really get a  feel for the music and you become part of it."  </P> <P> Although all Norbertines sing, few have had formal musical training, Smith  said. Seminarians may never have sung in a choir or learned to read music  before coming to St. Michael's, "but we give them plenty of experience once  they get here," he added.  </P> <P> At the abbey, not only do they learn to read music, but they master the  complexities of the ancient "square notation" used in Gregorian chant, in which  the musical note heads are square-shaped rather than oval and have no stems to  indicate rhythm.  </P> <P> "I was mostly used to guitar Masses before coming here, and that just didn't  appeal to me," said Frater Justin Ramos (the designation is Latin for brother),  a seminarian from Los Angeles. "When I first heard Gregorian chant, it really  stirred me. I had learned the notation, and when I came here that was made  alive for me. That drew me. They place such a great emphasis on it here. It  really inspired me to want to learn it more."  </P> <P> Romy Kirchhoefer, a postulant from Salt Lake City, said he came to the abbey  for a Palm Sunday Mass before entering St. Michael's Prep School, "and they  were playing the Gregorian chant through the speakers outside. That was the  first time I'd heard it, really, outside of maybe an old movie somewhere.  </P> <P> "It was really a powerful factor in my wanting to join the community because I  thought that it was really beautiful. I liked the way people were wearing the  white habit and that they were in a religious community, but I think the  Gregorian chant was really the determinant for me."  </P> <P> Kirchhoefer, Ramos and a handful of other seminarians have learned enough of  the chant and of the more familiar polyphonic music -- which employs harmony --  to qualify for the abbey's polyphonic schola. This is a smaller choir that  sings four-part pieces daily in rehearsal and performs traditional Christmas  carols in parts beginning on Christmas Eve.  </P> <P> "They're the cream of the musical crop at St. Michael's," said Smith, who has a  bachelor's degree in music education from Cal State Fullerton.  </P> <P> The sound produced by both choirs was striking enough to get the attention of  John and Deborah Traylor, record producers from Huntington Beach. They arranged  for the choirs to record a compact disc of Christmas songs and chants last  December. The disc was released in Southern California in October.  </P> <P> The songs and chants on the recording don't show the polish of a professional  choir, but they weren't meant to, Smith noted.  </P> <P> "We didn't learn any music specifically for the recording," he said. "We said,  'OK, we've sung the midnight Mass, now we're going to document it.' We wanted  as much as possible to have it sound just as it sounds when people come to  midnight Mass here. We did not want it to be too polished. We did not want a  studio sound. We wanted people to be able to hear in their homes what it's like  to come to midnight Mass at St. Michael's."  </P> <P> In dealing with Gregorian chant, he said, "the true professionals are not  necessarily the ones with (musical) expertise because Gregorian chant embodies  a centuries-old tradition of worship. The true professionals in that kind of  music are the ones who have dedicated their lives to living out that  tradition."  </P> <P> For the seminarians and priests of St. Michael's, working as a choir is an  outgrowth of a communal life unique to Orange County. Most priests in the  county are of the diocesan, or parish, variety and live in small numbers in  rectories near their churches. The Norbertines are priests of the type known as  religious, and most of them live together in a specific location dedicated  specifically to their community: the abbey.  </P> <P> The community of Norbertine priests that would eventually live at the abbey  began when a small group of Hungarian Norbertines established the seminary on  El Toro Road in 1961. Five years later, the prep school began to accept  non-seminarian students as boarders.  </P> <P> In 1984, the community was given full abbey status by the Vatican, a step that  indicates the church hierarchy "feels that you have a community that is going  to be around permanently," Smith explained. "It kind of shows that you have  become self-sufficient."  </P> <P> Young men studying to be priests at St. Michael's begin as postulants and  attend classes at Saddleback College for at least two years if they have had no  previous college training. If they and the priests at the abbey decide they are  ready to continue their studies, they go on to live at the abbey as novices and  study theology and philosophy there for two years. Their final studies before  being ordained are completed in Rome.  </P> <P> The priests take the common vows of poverty, chastity and obedience, but for  the Norbertines there is another, lesser vow: stability. They promise to remain  with the community at the abbey. This powerful sense of community is one of the  main reasons several of the seminarians said they decided to study with the  Norbertines.  </P> <P> "A priest friend of mine who is at a parish in Costa Mesa told me that at one  time in his life, he desired the community life because he said that life in  the rectory, as ironic as it seems, is very lonely," Kirchhoefer said. There  are only a small handful of priests who live at each parish, he said, but "in  the community life, you have tens of people going through the same things, the  same troubles, the same joys and everything is much more like a family."  </P> <P> That family used to be much more isolated. When ground was broken on the 35  acres where the abbey now sits, the hillside was "nothing but rocks," Smith  said. Years before widespread development worked its way north on El Toro Road,  the abbey was a kind of quiet, isolated oasis among the scrub brush.  </P> <P> Today, the grounds are covered with a lush variety of trees and flowering  plants (planted and tended by the priests and seminarians), and quiet and  tranquillity still surround the place. But on the facing hillside, across El  Toro Road, a large housing tract has sprung up. It has produced mixed feelings  in the religious community.  </P> <P> "When the first founding fathers came here from Hungary," Kirchhoefer said,  "the only thing here was Cook's Corner, a popular hangout for motorcycle clubs,  and it was relatively quiet. I think most of us like that because it sets the  ambience for our spiritual life, and also for our prayer life and our studies.  We get enough (of life outside the abbey) when we go out to work at the  parishes. We just want to come back and just be quiet. But the ambience now has  changed considerably."  </P> <P> But, said Frater Xavier Cloney, a seminarian from West Covina, another priest  at the abbey put the concept of isolation into a different perspective.  </P> <P> "One time I complained to the principal of the school here that we were getting  surrounded, and he told me that we didn't come here to get away from people.  Now, he said, they were coming to us. Our intention was to have just enough  land for a high school and an abbey."  </P> <P> Said Kirchhoefer: "I didn't come here for the hills. I came here for the life  and for the spirituality."  </P> <P> And, of course, for the music, particularly at Christmastime. But, unlike the  commercial world, the Norbertines never jump the gun on holiday celebrations.  </P> <P> "Our Christmas really begins for us right on Christmas Day," Ramos said. "The  time before that, for us, is a time of waiting and expectation, waiting for our  Lord. Midnight Mass is really the climax. And everything remains for two or  three weeks after Christmas, but our decorations -- the trees, the lighted  candles and so forth -- don't go up until Christmas Eve."  </P> <P> But, Smith added, Christmas carols and chant are heard weeks before the  decorations arrive. Like all other seasonal singers, the Norbertines must start  rehearsing "Angels We Have Heard On High" and "Silent Night" in November. And,  if a few clinkers work their way into the music during the Christmas Masses,  well, the priests are in the business of forgiving.  </P> <P> "As a musician, there were a lot of things I would have liked to have cleaned  up (in the recording)," Smith said. "But as a priest and a Norbertine, I  wouldn't want to dabble with it one bit, because this is from their hearts."  </P></p>

			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / People: Scotia's new chairman? Sir James McKinnon, who steps down as director general of the Office of Gas Supply in September, could soon be leading a small but glamorous pharmaceutical company on to the stock market. He has been made deputy chairman of Scotia Holdings, the research-based drug company, which expects to float its shares within the next year or so. Sir James, 63, was also made deputy chairman of financial services and media group MAI last week. MAI, like Scotia, is headed by Sir Ian Morrow. The two men know each other from their days when they were presidents of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Scotland. Given that Sir Ian is now over 80, it is thought he will hand over the chairmanship of MAI and Scotia to Sir James. Although Scotia only had a turnover of Pounds 16m in the year to last June it has spent over Pounds 32m on pharmaceutical research and development since it was founded by its chief executive Dr David Horrobin. In order to continue its heavy spending in this area, the company is keen to get its shares fully listed on the stock market. Apart from recruiting Sir James McKinnon, there are a number of other well-known names on Scotia's board of directors including James McAdam, chairman of Ratners, and William Glynn-William, deputy managing director of Glaxo Pharmaceuticals UK. To pave the way for its stock market float, Scotia has hired Kleinwort Benson as its merchant bank and Hoare Govett as broker. The company is owned by a couple of venture capital funds, Dr Horrobin's family and about 200 shareholders. The shares are traded in a small way under rule 535. On the basis of the last price of Pounds 7.80, the company is valued at around Pounds 180m.</p>

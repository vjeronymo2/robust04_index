			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / UK Company News: Davies &amp; Newman warns of downturn DAVIES &amp; NEWMAN, the holding company for Dan-Air, the UK-based airline, yesterday warned of a 'material reduction' in 1992 profits compared to forecasts made during the company's refinancing last October. Mr David James, the company doctor who became chairman in 1990 when D&amp;N came close to collapse, said market conditions in the first quarter this year were disappointing. He blamed continuing recession and uncertainty caused by the election, which reduced business travel especially. However, he reported a 'dramatic upturn' in passengers and forward bookings since the election result. Forecasts made during the refinancing of Pounds 22m profits this year are now unattainable. 'Nonetheless, we believe it is still feasible to see a return to profit in 1992, subject to a market recovery at the levels we anticipate,' he said. D&amp;N announced pre-tax losses of Pounds 35.5m in the year to December 31, in line with forecast losses of Pounds 35m and ahead of 1990 losses of Pounds 38.7m. Turnover of Pounds 317.8m was slightly ahead of forecasts of Pounds 312.1m, but below 1990's Pounds 365.2m. The shares fell 11p to 90p. Only two of four Boeing 727-200s due for disposal were sold during the period, raising a surplus of Pounds 1.31m. However, a third aircraft has since been sold. The interest charge fell to Pounds 7.23m (Pounds 9.74m) as proceeds of the Pounds 49.3m placing reduced borrowings and brought gearing down to 67 per cent, from 518 per cent a year earlier. Exceptional items totalled Pounds 11.4m (Pounds 4.15m), which included a Pounds 7.5m special fee to Lloyds Bank and others for extending banking facilities. The closure of the airline's charter base in Berlin cost a further Pounds 1.1m. Extraordinary profits of Pounds 7.39m, compared to forecasts of Pounds 7.1m, came from the sale of Dan-Air Engineering. The company is not paying a dividend. There was a retained loss of Pounds 13m. But after accounting for expanded share capital, shareholders' funds increased to Pounds 42.8m (Pounds 15.1m). Mr James said changes promised during the refinancing were all under way. Licences for seven new scheduled routes had won approval from the Civil Aviation Authority, although two routes, Cairo and Istanbul, were pending approval from their respective governments. The fleet's average age has been reduced to 12.1 years (14.5 years) and the 1995 target remains 5.4 years. Mr James said he would stay with the company for up to one more year. This follows the appointment earlier this month as group chief executive of Mr John Olsen, who joined from Cathay Pacific. COMMENT Should yesterday's warning on 1992 profits be seen as an inevitable reaction to grim markets, or as an admission that last October's forecasts were unrealistic? Certainly the assumption of a 7 per cent increase in European passenger yields for this year now looks optimistic, after yields have already been undercut by static business travellers in the first few months. The problem for investors, and for Mr James, is judging whether the strong pick up since the election is sustainable or another false dawn. Those who do not yet quite buy D&amp;N's recovery potential may prefer to wait until the annual meeting for a clearer update. Until then, City forecasts for this year of Pounds 5m profits put the shares on a multiple of more than 20, suggesting the market has already discounted the upside.</p>

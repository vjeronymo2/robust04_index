			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / Names at odds over the pace of protest: Action taken by Lloyd's members THIS WEEK'S bitter attack by Mr Peter Nutting on other prominent figures among Lloyd's Names highlights the difficulties of organising a group of individuals unaccustomed to collective action and political manoeuvring. It has also illustrated the depth of divisions among the loss-making Names at the insurance market. Attracted by the prospect of easy money and social cachet, Lloyd's Names - the individuals whose assets back underwriting at the insurance market - traditionally have had little interest in campaigning. Over the past few years that attitude has changed. Just under half of Lloyd's 22,400 Names have joined the Association of Lloyd's Members, which since its formation in the early 1980s has become the broad representative body for all Names. The association's focus, however, is on the provision of information and advice to its members - all of whom face unlimited liability for any insurance losses - and it cannot hope to advance the interests of the substantial minority of Names who have suffered severe losses. As a result, Names on loss-making syndicates have begun to form their own organisations. Several thousand Names are either taking or contemplating legal proceedings against their agents, and in one case against Lloyd's itself, on grounds of negligence or a failure of duty of care. More than a dozen associations or action groups have been created, and groups have also appointed public-relations advisers to lead press and media campaigns on their behalf. Mr Nutting is himself a prominent figure in this growing movement, having led a successful legal campaign for 1,000 Outhwaite Names which resulted in a Pounds 116m out-of-court settlement in February. In April Mr Nutting agreed to chair a new umbrella group of loss-making Names - the Lloyd's Names Associations Working Party. With the Lloyd's Council indicating that it was prepared to help badly affected Names, the working-party group might have provided the Names with a way to negotiate a settlement outside the courts. However, Mr Nutting resigned last week, saying that he could not work with Names' leaders who were opposed to this more moderate approach. 'Some leaders and members of the committees of some action groups are involved in a highly organised campaign of vilification against Lloyd's, its council and most of those who earn their living on the market,' Mr Nutting said. He urged other Names to reject the leadership of what he called 'extremists', and attacked efforts to obtain injunctions to prevent Lloyd's drawing down on the deposits which all Names must lodge with their agents when they join the market. Mr Nutting suggested also that Names' groups should be more patient about the pace of their legal campaigns. However, many Names on another group of loss-making Lloyd's syndicates have supported more radical action and reject Mr Nutting's advice as representing the interests of the Lloyd's establishment. Those radicals are in no mood for compromise. They are among 6,000 or so Names who are members of syndicates - such as those managed by the Gooda Walker and Feltrim agencies  -which specialised in catastrophe or spiral reinsurance, in which Lloyd's syndicates and London market companies reinsure each others' exposure to catastrophe loss, and which have borne a large share of Lloyd's losses. Many joined the market recently and with relatively few assets are ill placed to meet the losses that have emerged after the series of catastrophes that shook world insurance markets between 1988 and 1990. Their anger of Names at the scale of their losses has been fuelled by evidence that members' agents may have mis-represented the character of the risks to which Names were exposed, and by the degree to which the market's overall losses have been concentrated in relatively few syndicates. Mr Alfred Doll-Steinberg, chairman of the Gooda Walker Action Group, the biggest single action group, which represents 2,100 Names, has been the most publicly visible radical. He rejects the 'pay now, sue later' advice proffered by moderates such as Mr Nutting. Mr Doll-Steinberg's group's has launched an attempt to seek a judicial review of Lloyd's. Mr Doll-Steinberg's legal adviser, Mr Richard Astor, has also started a separate lobbying group, the Names Fraud Action Group. The Distressed Names LMX Spiral Action Group, led by Mr Andrew Grossman, a US lawyer and Name, has attempted to unite Names on other spiral syndicates behind the more radical approach. His group is planning its own effort to seek injunctions as well as launching a legal action alleging negligence. Mr Grossman has been connected with litigation in the United States, where about 100 Names are alleging breaches by Lloyd's of US securities laws when it recruited them. Both Mr Doll-Steinberg and Mr Grossman have been vigorous lobbyists. As well as winning support in the press, Names have fought a highly effective campaign in parliament, making common cause with a group of Conservative MPs, many of whom are themselves Names. Extensive use of parliamentary privilege has been made to promote allegations by MPs from both main parties of insider trading - which say outsiders were stuffed on to the LMX or 'dustbin' syndicates while insider working Names creamed off the safest and most profitable business for themselves. Tensions between the more moderate and radical approaches have come to the surface recently as leading executives at the Corporation of Lloyd's examines the mechanics of its bail-out plan. Mr Nutting's resignation may well set back these efforts. It indicates that it may be difficult to reconcile the instincts of more moderate Names with those of the more militant. That might make a compromised deal for Names harder to achieve and must make it all the more likely that the legal action dogging the market will continue.</p>

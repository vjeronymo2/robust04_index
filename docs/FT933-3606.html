			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: An example to follow Sir, Your survey of Northern Ireland (September 9) was both interesting and informative. One cannot but think that if a political solution to the problems besetting the country could be found, great improvements would be made. At a time when both South Africa and Israel have thought the unthinkable and negotiated with their enemies and brought political solutions in sight, should not our government similarly buckle down to finding a political solution in Northern Ireland? Perhaps the foreign secretary could devote more of his efforts to this very worthwhile end. If this government could come to some sort of an arrangement in Northern Ireland, I am sure it would reap huge political gains and might even go some way towards solving its long-term financial problems.

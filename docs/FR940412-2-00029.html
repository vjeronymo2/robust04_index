The Government recognizes that even among responsible contractors there are different degrees of performance risk. The Government, under this program, is willing to pay higher prices to lower risk contractors to obtain on-time delivery of quality products. The PIC program works under the premise that award to a contractor with a good delivery and quality record for the Federal Stock Class (FSC) in question will improve the chances of the Government receiving a quality product on time. Under the PIC program, an award may be made to other than the low-price offeror. The on-line system provides the policy, definitions, applicability, procedures, and clauses/provisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.

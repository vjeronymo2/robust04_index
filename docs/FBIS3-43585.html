The reasons for the arrest were not known this morning.  However, Issue No. 15 of the newspaper, which was supposed to  be published on 6 January, was seized at the printing house by  administrative authorities. The paper was then suspended.    LE NOUVEL INDEPENDANT has distinguished itself these past  weeks by publishing articles denouncing some scandals within the  corridors of power.    On the other hand, it has been reported that PERSPECTIVE  HEBDO, another independent newspaper published in Douala, the  economic capital of the country, has also been suspended.  According to the managing editor, Mr. Joseph-Marie Bessery, the  previous issue had already been seized.    PRESPECTIVE HEBDO, which investigated sports scandals which  have taken place over the past few weeks in Cameroon, published  in this issue an investigation concerning the scandal that  rocked the former Cameroon Bank Society, which was declared  brankrupt in 1991.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Durban June 20 SAPA -- The choice of capital for  KwaZulu/Natal will be discussed at a Provincial Cabinet meeting  in Pietermaritzburg on Tuesday [21 June], a day after the  African National Congress leader in the province criticised the  Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] national leadership of "interfering"  in the debate. The 11-member executive is to meet on Tuesday  for its weekly gathering, the first since its three ANC MECs  [members of the Executive Committee] boycotted the previous one  in Ulundi.    On Monday, ANC KwaZulu/Natal leader Jacob Zuma told a Durban  press conference he would take the opportunity on Tuesday to  solve the mounting crisis surrounding the choice of capital.  But, he warned, the province was "heading for trouble" if the  IFP went ahead with its unilateral plan to hold the first  meeting of the legislature in Ulundi next week.    Mr Zuma repeated the ANC's plan to boycott this meeting and  he criticised IFP leader and Home Affairs Minister Mangosuthu  Buthelezi for meddling in the province's affairs. He was  reacting to Mr Buthelezi's reported threats at the weekend to  expel IFP members if they favoured Pietermaritzburg over Ulundi  as the capital.    Mr Buthelezi, he said, was behind the move to make Ulundi a  provisional capital: "He has clearly discussed the matter in  public and has been openly confrontational on the issue."    If "national figures stopped interfering...if we are left  alone we could work it out," Mr Zuma said, but added that  central government would be forced to intervene if the issue was  not resolved. He said that if central government was not  convinced the region was ready to govern it would withhold  powers from the province.    Mr Zuma said the Transitional Executive Council had decided  before elections that Pietermaritzburg should act as a  provisional capital until the first sitting of the legislature  settled the permanent capital venue. He said the issue should  be discussed openly by the elected representatives of the  province and all parties should abide by their choice.    KwaZulu/Natal premier Dr Frank Mdlalose said on Monday the  issue would be discussed at Tuesday's cabinet meeting. Dr  Mdlalose repeated his personal preference for Ulundi as a  capital, but added that no final decision had been taken and  "the IFP will weigh all evidence carefully before making a final  decision".    He suggested a commission should examine the issue and make  recommendations, which could take up to two months, and then a  referendum should be held to test residents' support for either  Ulundi or Pietermaritzburg.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] To date, the Lithuanian economy subjects debt to the  power engineering system is in the sum of 230 million litas.  This was said by Prime Minister Adolfas Slezevicius on  Lithuanian Radio today.    According to him, the government will be compelled to adopt  unpopular measures because such a debt cannot be endless. In  spite of all debts, the supply of hot water to Lithuania's  residents will not be interrupted. It is natural that the  prices of the power engineering sources will go up, because they  have not changed for almost a year, and inflation has been  taking place in all branches of the economy, said Adolfas  Slezevicius. The compensation mechanism, because of the future  increase in the price for people who must be socially supported,  has already been prepared.    According to the prime minister, in the size of fuel and  electricity subsidies, Lithuania occupies first place among the  Baltic states. According to him, Lithuania subsidizes about 70  percent of the true price of electricity, Latvia -- about 30  percent, and Estonia has altogether rejected such subsidies.  This year over 200 million litas are to be allocated in the  budget to subsidize the power engineering system.    Power Engineering Minister Algimantas Stasiukynas, who took  part in the broadcast, said that the power engineering system  has so far used about 145 million dollars of foreign credits.  Commenting on such use of foreign credits by Lithuania, Adolfas  Slezevicius said that because of a great shortage of turnover  funds in the power engineering system and of high debts for fuel  to foreign countries, we have been compelled to use part of the  foreign credits to amass state fuel reserves. According to him,  this made it possible essentially, to eliminate all debts for  the purchase of fuel and remain warm during the last winter.    Today, Lithuania has no oil debts, and the natural gas debt  is in the sum of 25 million dollars. Meanwhile, the gas  consumers debt to the power engineering system is in the sum of  60 million dollars. By the way, Lithuania has been paying world  prices for fuel for the second year now.</p>

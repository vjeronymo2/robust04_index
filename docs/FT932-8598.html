			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / International Company News: ABB Asea Brown Boveri improves first quarter operating earnings ABB Asea Brown Boveri, the leading power engineering group, has improved first quarter operating earnings by 1 per cent to Dollars 409m, writes Ian Rodger from Zurich. It expects pre-tax profit for 1993 as a whole to be at about the same level as last year's Dollars 1.11bn. The group said the downturn in demand in Europe continued in the quarter, putting pressure on prices and reducing volumes for several ABB businesses. However, the depreciation of currencies in countries such as Sweden, where the group has important operations, has created opportunities. Indications of an economic recovery in North America have not yet shown up in the group's new order figures, but orders from Asia continued to grow well. New orders in the first quarter were down 3 per cent from a year earlier but the order backlog at end-March was Dollars 29.4bn, up 11 per cent.</p>

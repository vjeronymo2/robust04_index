			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Jupiter Tyndall advances 65% A substantial increase in the profits of the fund management division were behind the 65 per cent increase in 1993 pre-tax at Jupiter Tyndall Group. Mr John Duffield, chairman, said that there had been a good start to the present year, with a further substantial rise in the fund management activities. The shares rose by 18p to 279p. On turnover up 33 per cent to Pounds 19.3m (Pounds 14.5m), profits were Pounds 9.41m (Pounds 5.71m). Earnings per share were 22.1p (13.6p) and an increased final dividend of 7p is proposed for a total of 11p (7.5p). An enhanced scrip issue alternative is also planned at a level 50 per cent higher than the cash payment. Fund management profits advanced 68 per cent to Pounds 6.69m with rises from pension funds, investment trusts, offshore funds and the company's Hong Kong office. The banking side fell slightly to Pounds 3.18m. As a result of the growth in fund management the split between Jupiter's two activities had changed from 53 per cent for fund management to 47 per cent for banking in 1992 to 68/32 over 1993.</p>

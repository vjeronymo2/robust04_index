			<p><P> October 10, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SIMI SCHOOLS SETTLE SUIT ALLEGING SEX HARASSMENT  </P> <P> The Simi Valley Unified School District has negotiated a tentative settlement  of a lawsuit that accused a high school principal of sexually harassing a staff  psychologist for two years until she accepted a demotion to escape him, lawyers  involved in the case said Monday.  </P> <P> Attorneys in the lawsuit refused to disclose the financial terms of the  agreement, but the psychologist who brought the lawsuit, Sara Kopman-Davis,  described the amount as "real substantial, especially for a school district."  </P> <P> "Settlement-wise, I'm satisfied, but money isn't what I wanted," said  Kopman-Davis, who filed suit in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles. "I wanted  him reprimanded. As far as I know, he has never been reprimanded."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Allegations Denied  </P> <P> The chief defendant, Apollo High School Principal Brad Greene, declined to  comment. His attorney, J. Jane Fox of Ventura, said he denied all the  allegations and that the pending settlement should not be considered an  admission of guilt.  </P> <P> Greene was accused in the lawsuit of making sexually explicit remarks to  Kopman-Davis as part of an effort to seduce her, of touching and grabbing her,  and of giving her a poor evaluation in the spring of 1987 after she repeatedly  rejected him -- including rebuffing his advances at a professional conference  in San Francisco, said her lawyer, Julia Dragojevic.  </P> <P> Fox and the school district's attorney, Donald F. Austin of Oxnard, said the  settlement agreement still had to be signed by Greene, as well as school  district officials, to become final, and that those signatures were expected  "within the next few days."  </P> <P> Austin acknowledged that under the terms of the agreement, three school  district officials were to be dismissed as defendants -- Supt. John Duncan and  two assistant superintendents, Allan Jacobs, who is in charge of curriculum,  and Robert Marcus, who was in charge of personnel and has since retired.  </P> <P> Kopman-Davis and Dragojevic claimed that she took her complaints about Greene  to the three officials and received no action except for an offer to transfer  to another school. She said Monday that she finally accepted a transfer in the  fall of 1987 from Apollo High School, the district's alternative high school  for problem students, to Royal High School, the district's main high school.  </P> <P> In accepting the transfer, Kopman-Davis said she took a demotion from school  psychologist to guidance counselor, accompanied by a $4,000 cut in salary.  </P> <P> She filed suit in August, 1988, after filing a complaint with the state Fair  Employment and Housing Board and being told it could take years to resolve,  according to Dragojevic. The suit named as defendants Greene, the school  district, the three district officials and the school board, the lawyer said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> District Administration  </P> <P> Austin said the district administration had investigated Kopman-Davis's claims  in good faith "but had very little to go on" because she did not provide any  corroborating evidence. He said she was given the chance to provide names of  witnesses or other sources during each meeting with the officials and did not,  leaving the district little choice but to offer her a transfer.  </P> <P> "They didn't know who to believe," said Austin, who described both Greene and  Kopman-Davis as respected employees. Greene, 48, has been employed by the  district since 1967, and Kopman-Davis, 32, since 1981, Dragojevic said.  </P> <P> School Board President Lewis Roth said that Greene had never been reprimanded  for sexual misconduct, and that the board had no plans to discipline him or  Kopman-Davis.  </P> <P> During the course of the litigation, three women gave sworn statements on  Kopman-Davis's behalf that they also had been sexually harassed by Greene while  employed as teachers at the school, according to Kopman-Davis and her lawyer.  </P> <P> One of the witnesses testified in a deposition that she had had a five-year  sexual relationship with Greene and that after she ended it, the principal  threatened to end her teaching career, according to Dragojevic. That woman and  a second witness have since left teaching, according to Dragojevic, who said  the third witness still works for Greene.  </P> <P> Fox declined to discuss the allegations against her client. According to  Austin, the district's attorney, Greene claimed that the allegations were made  in response to an evaluation he wrote of Kopman-Davis, faulting her work.  </P> <P> Greene said Monday that he is still employed by the district as principal of  Apollo High School, which serves about 300 students.  </P> <P> Supt. Duncan did not return a reporter's phone calls Monday. Board member Diane  Collins refused to comment.  </P></p>

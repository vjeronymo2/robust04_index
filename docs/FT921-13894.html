			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Sport: High risk game for top casinos - Gaming and nowhere more intensely than on the so-called Mayfair strip in London. The drop, or money exchanged for chips, in London's casinos reached almost Pounds 1.2bn last year. But the top clubs face an uncertain future. Casinos in trouble include the Ritz in Piccadilly and Les Ambassadeurs in Park Lane. They face the ultimate risk: that they may be closed down  - rien ne va plus - if the police and Gaming Board decide to oppose renewal of their licences following a dawn raid last June. The recession has not hurt the gaming industry. High-stakes players such as Australian tycoon Kerry Packer or Saudi Arabia's 'Mr Fixit', Adnan Kashoggi, are still often seen at the tables. The high-rollers come mainly from abroad. The British do not, it seems, have the money these days to play for life-and-death stakes, as the scions of the shires did in the heyday of John Aspinall, formerly one of Mayfair's leading casino proprietors. However, Aspinall is planning a come-back later this year with a new licence which might well flush out old English money again. Nowadays it is to the Far East - Malaysia, Hong Kong and Japan - that the casinos look for big-money players. A handful of flamboyant gamblers are prepared to play off a credit line of six figures and gamble Pounds 500,000 in a weekend. Betting Pounds 1,000 on an individual number at roulette and covering all the numbers round it, a player can rake in as much as Pounds 396,000 on a single coup and put a serious crimp in a casino's finances. If the wrong number comes up, the player loses Pounds 40,000. Top casinos will take bets of Pounds 50,000 a hand at punto banco (the British form of baccarat) and Pounds 10,000 at blackjack. When one of the internationally-known high rollers comes to town, rival casinos buzz with excitement. Which club will the player favour? No matter that such gamblers, if they hit a winning streak, can clear enough to make or break the house; the action is what counts. If the player returns the next night the law of probabilities will reward the casino. It is the competition between casinos to attract high rollers from abroad that could, in part, explain the present crisis. The Ritz Club is the most successful casino in London, with an annual profit of around Pounds 8m. From the famous Ritz bar, with its gilt and mirrors, to its temple of gaming tables attended by votaries gowned by Yuki in flowing red silk, it reeks of luxury. The newly re-opened Les Ambassadeurs, in Hamilton Place at the end of Park Lane, is a former Rothschild mansion and a celebration of high Victorian taste. Its restoration cost Pounds 7m, which the company is said to have recouped in the first three months of play. Nemesis came out of the blue. London Clubs, owner of these and four other London casinos, was about to go public with a long-planned share flotation when, at 3.45am last June 6, 250 police and the entire inspectorate of the Gaming Board descended on its main casinos. The police were as discreet as they could be. The gamblers, intent on the final spin of the wheel before the night was over, were not disturbed. Instead, as soon as the clubs were empty the police began removing all the company's files and computer records. The police said they chose that time so they could remove all the papers they wanted. Woken from their beds, managers organised copying machines across the casino floor. Around 50,000-60,000 documents were removed. What, though, were the police looking for? What would have justified such a dramatic raid on London's most successful casino group? As yet, there are no answers. 'We have been waiting for six months but we are still in the dark,' says London Clubs' management. 'It's a very difficult time for us because we have 2,300 staff who are fearful for their jobs. All we can do is wait it out.' A decision on whether to proceed against the company will have to be made shortly, if only because its casino licences come up for renewal in the spring. The Gaming Board has given no hint on whether it is worried by so-called technical issues - complimentary services ('comps') to players or control of credit and clearing of cheques - such as led to the closure of Playboy's casino in Park Lane 10 years ago. Such matters are regarded as the touchstone of good conduct in British casino gambling. The guiding legal principle is that casinos are prohibited from inducing players to gamble. But there are grey areas. For instance, it is not clear how far overseas players may be offered 'comps' such as air fares and hotel suites. Casinos from Monte Carlo to Las Vegas to Darwin offer comps as the easiest way of bringing in good customers. British casinos, striving to compete, are restricted in what they can offer by way of hospitality. In a celebrated dictum, the board once suggested diaries and pens as suitable gifts to favoured customers. In practice, there is no objection to players being entertained to dinner in the clubs or chauffeured to events such as Ascot or Wimbledon. For the past decade, since Coral and Ladbroke were forced to dispose of their casinos after charges of corruption, the chief danger to the British casino industry has been its dullness. Now rumours abound, some quite lurid. It is said that some London casinos are the haunt of call-girls, although that seems unlikely. There are many pretty women to be seen at the tables; but any woman can wear a designer dress and carry a Chanel handbag. In spite of London Clubs' anxiety about its future, the wheels are spinning as fast as ever. The company hopes to make a profit of more than Pounds 20m this year. After the raid, the management had an independent check done on its books and claims to have found no cause for concern. Whatever happens, the present case is the biggest event to hit British casinos since the shake-out of Ladbroke and Coral and the departure of Playboy. The industry is worried about its good name. The threat facing London Clubs shows that the risks of casino gambling are not all on the players' side of the table.</p>

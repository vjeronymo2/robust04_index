			<p><P> October 17, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 2 LIVE CREW TRIAL OPENS; DEFENSE OPPOSES INTRODUCTION OF TAPE  </P> <P> A prosecutor warned a jury of four women and two men Tuesday that they would  hear "graphic depictions of sexual conduct . . . violent sex acts, and women  being abused . . . " during the landmark obscenity trial of the controversial  rap group 2 Live Crew.  </P> <P> The attorney for band leader Luther Campbell countered that "certainly (the  songs) are sexually related, but sex is not verboten in this country. This is  not about offending people. This is about a legal test."  </P> <P> Campbell and two other band members, Mark Ross and Chris Wongwon, face  misdemeanor obscenity charges in a case that has raised important legal  questions over censorship and cultural values. If convicted, each faces up to a  year in prison and fines of up to $1,000.  </P> <P> As the trial opened, the attorneys agreed with Judge June Johnson that  observers under 18 should be barred from the courtroom.  </P> <P> Assistant Broward County prosecutor Leslie Robson said he would play a tape  recording secretly made by an undercover sheriff's deputy who attended a June  10 performance by the group at a Hollywood, Fla., nightclub. The microcassette  recording was made three days after the group's album, "As Nasty as They Wanna  Be," was declared obscene by a federal judge.  </P> <P> Before the tape could be played to the jury, however, Bruce Rogow, attorney for  Campbell, charged that it had been tampered with and was therefore not  admissible as evidence. The tape the prosecution seeks to play for the jury has  been digitally enhanced for clarity, and entire verses of some songs have been  omitted, Rogow said.  </P> <P> Johnson said she would rule on Rogow's motion today.  </P> <P> Even if the tape is played, Rogow expressed confidence that prosecutors would  be unable to prove that the 2 Live Crew performance appealed to the prurient  interests of the average Broward County resident and lacked any serious  literary, artistic or political value.  </P> <P> Rogow and Campbell freely admit that the lyrics of the black group's songs are  raunchy, and probably offensive to many. But they also contend that the group  has been singled out for prosecution by Broward County Sheriff Nick Navarro.  The band and some free-speech advocates contend the prosecution is rooted in  whites' misunderstanding of black culture or animosity toward young blacks.  </P> <P> The day before the band was arrested, Ft. Lauderdale record store owner Charles  Freeman was charged with selling an obscene album after an undercover sheriff's  deputy bought a copy of "As Nasty as They Wanna Be." Two weeks ago an all-white  jury found him guilty, marking the first time in U.S. history that anyone has  been convicted of selling an obscene musical work. He is to be sentenced Nov.  2.  </P> <P> The jurors in the 2 Live Crew case were picked after six days of questioning.  One is black, a 61-year-old woman. The two men, ages 24 and 26, are the  youngest. The oldest juror is a 76-year-old woman, a retired sociology  professor.  </P> <P> Campbell said Tuesday that the jury "ain't the group needed for this case, but  we got to deal with what we got. Based on the people we've seen, they're OK."  </P></p>

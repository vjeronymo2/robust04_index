			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / BMA to compile GP survival guide FAMILY DOCTORS have instructed the British Medical Association to draw up a 'comprehensive survival guide' for general practitioners who may wish to stop providing National Health Service treatment. A motion calling for the preparation of the guide was adopted at a conference of the BMA's general medical services committee, which represents family doctors, last week. It was passed against the advice of the BMA leadership. The immediate cause of concern, expressed in the motion, is the possible implication for GPs of the government's proposed re-organisation of health services in London. This envisages employing some family doctors on direct NHS contracts - GPs are currently independent contractors - and the possible involvement of the private sector in primary healthcare services. BMA leaders believe, however, that the success of the motion also reflects a wider and growing frustration among GPs and hospital doctors about salaries and conditions of service. In such circumstances a threat to stop providing NHS treatment is the doctors' ultimate sanction. Doctors are, like other public sector employees, waiting to see whether the government decides to continue a version of its 1.5 per cent pay ceiling for a second year. If the ceiling is abandoned, the BMA plans to make representations to the doctors' and dentists' pay review body that medical earnings suffered in relation to other professions in the 1980s. With the move to locally-managed trust hospitals under the 1991 NHS reforms, it is now uncertain how long review body-recommended national pay scales for hospital doctors will remain in existence. Mr Chris Wilson, human resources director of Homewood NHS Trust, Surrey  - which has pioneered the introduction of local contracts - told the National Association of Health Authorities and Trusts conference last week that pay accounted for about 70 per cent of a trust's costs. 'Any organisation that says it is not interested in how 70 per cent of its resources are being used is probably being quite irresponsible.'</p>

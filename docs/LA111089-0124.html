			<p><P> November 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE PROFESSOR AND THE MYSTERY WRITER;  </P> <P> BOOKS: WHEN CAROLYN HEILBRUN CREATED HER DETECTIVE 25 YEARS AGO, SHE WAS AFRAID  SHE WOULD BE FOUND OUT BY COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY OFFICIALS. TODAY SHE'S A  RESPECTED NOVELIST OF THAT GENRE.  </P> <P> Kate Fansler, erudite detective, does not actually exist. Wealthy, brainy,  witty, willowy, prone to putting aside her duties as a tenured professor of  literature at a very Columbia-like university just long enough to solve the  occasional murder -- how could she be real? She lives and offers her sardonic  observations on the world only in the pages of mysteries by Amanda Cross.  </P> <P> Who does not actually exist either. Cross, elegant mystery author, sells quite  respectably for the genre, has won the Nero Wolfe award and been nominated for  the prestigious Edgar, and recently published the ninth novel in the Fansler  series, "A Trap for Fools." For years, readers wondered who she was, unaware  that there is no Amanda Cross except on book jackets.  </P> <P> On the other hand, Carolyn Heilbrun, a distinguished professor of literature at  Columbia and an influential feminist critic, is entirely real. Being real, she  found herself, in 1963 at age 37, pressed on every side: teaching a full course  load, seeking tenure, sharing her university office with colleagues and her  Riverside Drive apartment with a husband, three children under the age of 8 and  a dog. "You're just never alone," she recalls, in the now-familiar lament of  what was then a rarer species, the hyphenated woman. "I felt I had very little  time of my own."  </P> <P> Worse luck, she was running out of the English mysteries she'd taken refuge in  for years. That was when Heilbrun invented Kate Fansler and, fearing possible  retaliation by the tenure-granters at Columbia, the pseudonym Amanda Cross.  "This is all hindsight," Heilbrun says, "but looking back, this was a space of  my own." As she wrote years later, "I sought to create an individual whose  destiny offered more possibility than I could comfortably imagine for myself."  </P> <P> It is a fitting time for hindsight, this 25th anniversary of her first Fansler  tale. Women have long been mystery writers (consider Agatha Christie, Ngaio  Marsh, Ruth Rendell, P.D. James) but when "In the Last Analysis" was published  in 1964, there'd been a historic dearth of female protagonists. "With the great  male writers -- Dashiell Hammett, Raymond Chandler, Ross MacDonald -- the women  were either bitches or the women they loved," Heilbrun says. "One of the things  that makes me feel very good is the number of women detectives there are now.  Women police detectives. Lesbian detectives."  </P> <P> Trend in Mysteries  </P> <P> Indeed, the great influx of women writers and characters is one of the  unmistakable trends in contemporary mysteries. Roughly 40% of the membership of  the Mystery Writers of America is female. A group called Sisters in Crime,  formed three years ago to promote women practitioners of the art, has grown  from 30 members (including Amanda Cross) to more than 500. Its president,  novelist Nancy Pickard, is among those who call Cross "something of a mentor,  literally or figuratively, for a lot of women mystery writers. . . . When my  turn came, there had been this person there first."  </P> <P> Heilbrun says she "had no noble ends in mind" in 1963, however. Begetting Prof.  Fansler was a hoot. "All detectives are fantasy figures in a sense," says  Heilbrun. This fantasy figure was roughly Heilbrun's age and shared her  profession, her astringent humor, her interest in social issues. She had an  Upper West Side apartment that probably didn't look terribly different from  Heilbrun's -- stuffed furniture in dignified colors, Oriental rugs, paintings  and the inevitable wall of books, an academic's home. Fansler even shares her  inventor's willingness to wander onto interesting but tangential conversational  paths. "I used to be quite thin myself," Heilbrun muses, gray-haired and  grandmotherly, though not a grandmother, at 63. "But the only way to stay thin  when you're old is to live on a lettuce leaf, like Jackie Kennedy."  </P> <P> Anyway. Where Fansler differed dramatically was that Heilbrun made her single,  childless, unencumbered. She gave her beauty because "I wanted to give her  everything and see what she would do with it." Heilbrun even granted her sleuth  a trust fund; "you can't have a detective who can't hop on a plane." Although,  she says thoughtfully, "this question about rich women. . . . They are the most  conservative, the most backward, the least adventurous." Heilbrun belongs to  the Cosmopolitan Club, where nearly every woman has money and her husband's  surname, "which I find simply appalling in this day and age."  </P> <P> Anyway. Heilbrun was sure her department would take a dim view of this sideline  when she was reviewed for tenure. "It was dangerous as it was; I was suspected  even then of being a feminist," she says. The name Amanda Cross, combining a  surname from a Nova Scotia road sign with an Anglophiliac first name and having  no other significance, sheltered Heilbrun for half a dozen years. Being  anonymous "was great fun, I now realize," she says. "Secrecy is always a kind  of power. . . . A sense of power was the last thing a woman was supposed to  have."  </P> <P> She had one unnerving experience: Her first Fansler mystery was nominated for  the Mystery Writers of America's Edgar award (after Poe, of course) and  Heilbrun feared she might win. "It would have just been awful, simply awful,"  she says. "There would've been some attempt to find out who (Cross) was." But  Cross was spared, and Heilbrun went on writing scholarly works under one name  and mysteries under the other, on one occasion corresponding with a fellow  professor-critic under both identities.  </P> <P> Cross had fans from the beginning, not so much for her plots ("not my strongest  point," she acknowledges) as for her gutsy heroine. "The women that I knew, and  I myself, were just entranced," says Jane Bakerman, professor of English at  Indiana State and a scholarly writer on mysteries. "Kate was smart. She held  down a major job in a major place. She was strong. She was a single woman who  regarded marriage as a choice, not a destiny. She was vocalizing some of the  things a number of us had felt or wished for." Bakerman wrote a paper on Cross  without knowing whom she was.  </P> <P> Cover Is Blown  </P> <P> It was the publication of "Poetic Justice" in 1970 that blew Heilbrun's cover.  The Fansler novels constitute sociocultural history as well as literate  entertainment; this time Fansler's university, reeling from the conflicts and  questions unleashed by a student takeover, was recognizably Columbia.  Furthermore, a revered but increasingly anachronistic senior faculty member,  whose graduate student Fansler had been, bore a marked resemblance to  Columbia's Lionel Trilling, whose graduate student Heilbrun had been.  </P> <P> Heilbrun the emergent feminist never confronted Trilling, but Kate Fansler  politely told her elder colleague that "I have never found youthful male  arrogance . . . especially appealing, while you, of course, have." ("There is a  certain amount of wish fulfillment in all writing," Heilbrun observes, mum on  the Trillingness of her fictional professor.)  </P> <P> "Poetic Justice" started people poking around. Her associates and friends began  to guess. One colleague even looked up the pseudonym at the copyright bureau.  Her children were getting older. "I don't believe in keeping a lot of secrets  from one's children," she says. And she was, by then, a tenured professor. So,  "gradually, it leaked out; I let it leak out."  </P> <P> Now, she rather likes being known as Cross, whose mysteries far outsell  Heilbrun's "Reinventing Womanhood" and "Writing a Woman's Life," among other  books. The only troubling part of the unmasking is the flackery involved in  book promotion. "It does worry me how publicity begins, how it snowballs," she  reflects, then veers back from the detour. "That's just grumbling about how  awful life is, which you tend to do after 60."  </P> <P> Older, Pricklier  </P> <P> Kate Fansler, over the course of nine novels, has grown older and pricklier as  well, though Heilbrun notes that "she's not aging at the same rate as normal  human beings." Fansler wed, though did not adopt the surname of, a wry attorney  from the D.A.'s office. "I did not want her to get married, but she got into  this relationship and relationships have momentum," Heilbrun explains. "But  she'll never have children, I promise you that." Over the years, too, "the  importance of other women in her life, women's bonds, women's friendships, has  grown."  </P> <P> In this she resembles her creator, who believes that "if we have individuals  who climb up and pull the ladder after them, this feminist wave will end like  the others." Heilbrun, "a feminist of a generation that produced very few of  them," was the token woman in virtually every arena she entered for years. But  this has changed: "The wealth of wonderful women I now know -- all of them  younger, of course -- it's one of the miracles of life." She points out that,  by the by, when women writers envision utopias, they are frequently all-female.  "Men don't invent all-male utopias, and the reason, of course, is that they  have utopia here." But she digresses.  </P> <P> Speaking of miracles, Heilbrun has been married to her economist-husband since  she was a 19-year-old Wellesley student, another "enormous secret" for years  lest other young women consider similarly premature commitment. It was the  Second World War, she tries to explain. "You didn't go to bed with people the  way people do today." Pause. "Today is much better." Fansler, known to have  lovers here and there, would no doubt agree.  </P> <P> Occasionally, Heilbrun thinks she ought to write something different, fiction  without Fansler. She's even given it a halfhearted try. "Doesn't work," she's  found; she's stuck with, as Fansler's husband once fondly called her, "a sort  of overage Nancy Drew."  </P> <P> "She haunts me. She's there," Heilbrun says with a confessional shrug. "I like  her."  </P></p>

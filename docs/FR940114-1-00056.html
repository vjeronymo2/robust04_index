			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Excessive Speed Causes Crashes <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Speeding is one of the most prevalent reported factors associated with crashes. Studies identify correlations between speeding and other factors including alcohol involvement, young drivers, male drivers, motorcyclists, and nighttime driving. Speeding is cited as a contributing factor in approximately 11 percent of all police-reported crashes and in approximately 34 percent of all fatal crashes (NHTSA, Fatal Accident Reporting System, 1991). It is estimated that in 1991, 13,909 fatalities and 77,277 moderate to critical injuries occurred in speed-related crashes. The economic cost of all speed-related crashes (including all injury levels) was over $18 billion. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Excessive speed has long been recognized as one of the prime factors contributing to motor vehicle crashes. This contribution has several sources: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Drivers have less time to react when travelling at higher speeds since speed increases the distance a vehicle travels during the time it takes for a driver to react to a perceived danger; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Speed increases the total stopping distance necessary to halt a vehicle; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Speed reduces a driver's ability to steer safely around curves on highways, or objects in the roadway. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A major speed-related factor which has been linked to crash involvement is speed variance: The difference in speed among vehicles in the traffic stream. Speed variance is calculated in terms of standard deviation from the mean speed. For example, ten vehicles all traveling at 55 mph on the same highway would have a mean speed of 55 mph and a standard deviation of zero, whereas five vehicles traveling at 65 mph and five vehicles traveling at 45 mph would have a mean speed of 55 mph but a standard deviation of 10.5. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Research studies such as those in 55:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> A Decade of Experience <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (Transportation Research Board, 1984) have shown that motor vehicle crashes are more likely where speed variance is greater. As speed variance increases, vehicles come close to each other more frequently. This leads to more frequent lane changes and passing maneuvers as the faster drivers seek to avoid slower vehicles. Data from the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> National Crash Severity Study <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (1979) show that vehicles travelling 20 mph above the average speed experience a crash risk 11 times greater than those travelling at the average speed. This data implies that crashes can be reduced by controlling speed variance. Controlling speed variance is especially critical on roadways with speed limits less than 65 mph, where conflicting actions and reactions typically cause much larger variations in speed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Speed Increases the Severity of Crashes <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The trend toward increased speeds is cause for concern because of the reduced margin for error and the increase in severity for those vehicles involved in crashes. As the speed of a car increases from 20 mph to 80 mph, a factor of four, the energy of the impact delivered in a collision with a fixed object goes up by a factor of sixteen. The chance of death or serious injury increases dramatically for every 10 mph increase in vehicle speed for the crash involved vehicle. The  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> National Crash Severity Study <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (NHTSA, 1979) revealed that a driver crashing with a 50 mph change in velocity is twice as likely to be killed as one crashing with a 40 mph change in velocity. In short, crashes at higher speeds increase the potential for more deaths and disabling injuries. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Have Effective Speed Control Countermeasures Been Developed? <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Enforcement personnel have several effective countermeasures available for speed control which have been developed by new technology. Traditional methods of speed control once involved the use of stopwatches and pneumatic hoses stretched across the roadway to determine vehicle speeds. Later developments included the introduction of radar and VASCAR which more precisely measured vehicle speeds and reduced the degree of possible operator error. Currently laser speed measuring devices with an extremely high degree of accuracy are becoming available to the law enforcement community.NHTSA has taken an active role in identifying and evaluating new law enforcement technology. After evaluating new devices, NHTSA has established demonstration programs to introduce those devices into the law enforcement community to further advance speed control efforts. These demonstration programs have included enforcing speed limits using radar, VASCAR, laser speed measuring devices, aerial speed measurement, photo radar, electronic signing and saturation patrols.NHTSA studies show that one of the best methods to obtain compliance with speed limits is to combine an aggressive enforcement campaign with a vigorous public information and education effort. Public service announcements (PSA) regarding speed are regularly developed and distributed by NHTSA. Furthermore, other effective countermeasures, such as saturation patrols and multi-agency, multi-jurisdictional enforcement efforts, have been developed and furnished to the law enforcement community. These programs can easily become a part of an agency's traffic enforcement program.Several highway design and traffic control measures have also demonstrated effectiveness for speed control. Freeway design, culminating in the Interstate System, eliminated all at-grade intersections thus providing for free flow traffic. This singular design characteristic resulted in significant reduction in speed variance and the promotion of uniform operating speed. Speed variances on the Interstate System have traditionally been in the range of 6&hyph;9 miles per hour while speed variances on non-freeway facilities can be as great as 20 miles per hour.In addition, the need to control speed for varying conditions has led to the development of variable message speed signs. These devices, first used on the New Jersey Turnpike in the late 1960's have had widespread implementation on all types of facilities and warn drivers of impeding congestion, weather conditions, construction, and incidents which required reduction in operating speed. Real time regulatory variable speed limits are now being tested in the State of Washington. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / People: Facilitating at McDonnell Douglas Peter Smith, a computer industry veteran of 25 years' standing, has been given the task of building McDonnell Douglas Information Systems' share of the UK's fastest growing data processing business. Now 49, he has been appointed director of the US company's facilities management business based at group headquarters in Hemel Hempstead, returning to the UK after a tour of duty as general manager of MDIS' Australasian operations. Facilities management, in which a company agrees to contract out its data processing operations to a computing services company for a fee, has become one of the hottest topics in data processing as companies retreat from services activities to concentrate on their core businesses. Some estimates put the potential for growth in the market in the UK at at least 30 per cent a year. The UK market leader is Hoskyns, owned by CGS of France, but MDIS already has some 10 contracts each valued between Pounds 0.5m and Pounds 7m. It aims to concentrate on areas it knows well - local authorities, central government, the police and health services (it was a runner-up in the London Ambulance Service contract) - rather than large general FM contracts. Smith has spent his life in the services business, having trained in hotel management ('so I cook and drink wine very well'), before moving into the computer business with posts in NCR and Honeywell Bull.</p>

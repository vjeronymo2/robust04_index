			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / Smith tops Labour leadership nominations MR JOHN SMITH, the shadow chancellor, yesterday confirmed his strong head start in the Labour leadership contest by winning nominations from 162 MPs, about 60 per cent of the parliamentary party. His lone rival, Mr Bryan Gould, shadow environment secretary, received 63 votes, only narrowly passing the 55 needed to qualify, leaving him a mountain to climb before the July 18 run-off at a conference of Labour's electoral college. The contest for the deputy leadership delivered a surprise when Mrs Margaret Beckett, widely seen as Mr Smith's 'dream ticket' partner, polled 89 votes - markedly lower than expected in what is now a fierce three-way battle. Mr Gould, who is running for both offices, recorded 69 votes for deputy while Mr John Prescott, candidate of the traditional Labour left, was just five votes behind on 64. The party's hard-left candidates were trounced, Mr Ken Livingstone's leadership challenge winning just 13 votes and Mr Bernie Grant, a candidate for deputy, scoring 15. The highly controversial preliminary phase of the leadership contest was also undoubtedly influenced by the last-minute withdrawal of Ms Ann Clwyd, the party's development spokesman. She backed out of the contest, amid fresh confusion yesterday morning on hearing that, contrary to her original understanding, Members of the European Parliament had not been permitted to make nominations. If Ms Clwyd's claims that she was close to the crucial 55 nominations are even half correct, the transfer of her votes may have made the difference between success and failure for Mr Prescott and Mr Gould. The focus in the election now shifts to the unions, commanding 40 per cent of the electoral college, and the constituency parties, which like MPs control 30 per cent. Nupe ballot, Page 10</p>

			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / CDU defies polls in east German vote Chancellor Helmut Kohl's governing Christian Democrats, struggling for months in the opinion polls, yesterday looked set to defy the pollsters by doing far better than expected in eastern Germany's local government elections. Despite substantial gains by the opposition Social Democrats and the Party of Democratic Socialism, the successor to the former east German Communist party, their support appears insufficient to dislodge the CDU from power in four of the five eastern German states, when state elections are held in June and October. Indeed, yesterday's rise in support for the PDS shows voters shifting their allegiance away from the SPD, as east Germans become sceptical that Mr Rudolf Scharping, head of the SPD, can offer viable alternative policies to Mr Kohl's. In exit polls published last night by the Infas pollsters for ARD television, the SPD's share of the vote in Saxony-Anhalt, considered a test case for Mr Kohl's CDU since it will be the first to hold state elections on June 26, increased from 22.8 per cent in 1990 to 29 per cent, while support for the PDS rose sharply from 12.7 per cent to 20 per cent. More surprisingly, support for the CDU fell less than three points to 33 per cent despite recent corruption scandals, mostly in the Free Democratic party, the junior partner in the CDU-led coalition in the state. The FDP'S share of the vote fell from 10 to about 6 per cent. These provisional results mean the CDU will have to increase its support to hold on to power. Even in the northern state of Mecklenberg-Vorpommern, where thousands of shipyard workers have lost their jobs as a result of closures or privatisation, the electorate swung behind the chancellor, with support for the CDU increasing from 27.8 to 33 per cent. The SPD, for its part, increased its share of the vote from 20 per cent in 1990 to over 27 per cent. But the PDS eroded possible greater gains for the SPD, as its support rose from 19 per cent to 25 per cent. In Saxony, CDU remains the largest party, although its support fell from 44 to about 39 per cent. The SPD's share rose from 14 to 22 per cent. Support for the PDS rose from 11.7 per cent to 16.5 per cent. The FDP slipped below 6 per cent, with its votes shifting to the Greens. In Thuringia, where a wave of strike by potash miners last year appeared to to undermine the support for the governing CDU/FDP coalition under Mr Bernhard Vogel, the CDU's share of the vote only fell from 41.9 to 39 per cent. In the western German state of Saarland, which is governed by the SPD, the CDU made gains, with its provisional vote rising from 35.3 per cent in 1989 to 36.9 per cent.</p>

			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / International Company News: Lotus issues warning of sharp drop in earnings Shares in Lotus Development, the US software company, are expected to come under pressure today following a profits warning issued late yesterday. It said earnings per share in the three months to the end of June were likely to be 20-25 cents, compared with 34 cents a year ago (before a one-off charge.) Analysts had been expecting earnings of nearly 50 cents a share for the latest quarter. Lotus blamed the revision on delays in upgrades to a number of its products. These upgrades will now be released in July and August, the company said, leading to what it predicted would be a strong performance in the second half of the year. For the year as a whole, Lotus predicted earnings per share of Dollars 1.80-Dollars 2, lower than its previous forecast of Dollars 2-Dollars 2.15. The company's shares have already fallen sharply in recent months, closing on Monday at Dollars 51 3/8 , having lost 40 per cent of their value since the middle of March. Although first quarter earnings were up by nearly three-quarters on a year before, sales growth in the first three month of the year was below market expectations, adding to fears that the company was losing out to Microsoft in applications software sales.</p>

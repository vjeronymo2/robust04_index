			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Confounding the image makers - The sudden bull market in US political advertising This has not been a predictable year for American political advertising. It began much as it left off in 1988, as a mixture of fuzzy warmth and below-the-belt assaults. Then along came Ross Perot and changed the rules by taking to the 'free' television talk show circuit as, promptly, did Bill Clinton and, much later, George Bush. Perot disappeared for a few months and the desultory norm was renewed. Now he is back again and paying for his own airtime at a phenomenal rate - and at precisely the same time as the Clinton and Bush campaigns have themselves shifted into top advertising gear. What looked a month ago like a lean year for income from political advertising, has now become a raging bull market. As of last week, the three major commercial TV networks alone reported bookings of Dollars 40.9m (Pounds 25m) from the campaigns, compared with a total of Dollars 38.5m spent by Bush and Dukakis four years ago - and this was with the intensive last two weeks of the campaign still to run. Of this sum, Dollars 17.7m came from Bush, Dollars 5.5m from Clinton and Dollars 17.3m from Perot. In one week alone, Perot bought Dollars 5.3m of advertising time from ABC. Moreover, these figures are incomplete. They do not include time bought on local and cable stations, where the more focused Clinton effort has been concentrated, nor on radio, where the cheapest and some of the dirtiest advertising has been. All told, figures of Dollars 100m plus for spending are being talked of. Money is not a problem. Figures this week suggest that Perot has spent about Dollars 57m, the bulk on advertising, since he is doing virtually no conventional campaigning, is flying in his private jet and is running only a skeleton political organisation. According to the Federal Election Commission last week, Clinton still had Dollars 25m cash in hand, while Bush's reserves were even higher at Dollars 36m. All of which would suggest that this election could turn out, even more than four years ago, to hinge on the advertising messages being conveyed. In reality, the notorious commercials which attacked Dukakis' supposed leniency towards the convicted criminal Willie Horton probably only padded Bush's margin of victory. But the lesson, practised in any number of mid-term elections and carried over into this year, was that going for the jugular paid dividends. Curiously, and assuming that Perot's ad blitz does not land him in the White House, the universal opinion is that, if anything, the reverse is true. The most popular political programmes have been the candidate debates, unvarnished as they are by the image makers. They attracted extraordinary audiences of 70-95m, a testament to what may well be a serious re-awakening of the American public's engagement in the political process. Perot's first paid half hour 'infomercial' earlier this month, aired on one network, was watched by no fewer than 15m people, the second most-watched programme in its time slot, according to the ratings. Subsequent versions have regularly out-drawn rival sitcoms. An 'infomercial' format is exactly the same as a conventional TV programme but has the single purpose of selling a product. Perot's infomercial was a throwback to some ancient time of the single fixed camera - showing just Perot at a desk, his charts and a pointer and lot of homespun wisdom about how 'simple' solving the budget deficit can be. Other half hours have been devoted to soft focus questioning about what a great family man and patriot he is, an image which, by implication, would never be conveyed by professional reporters, whom he detests. Perot is also flooding the ether with conventional 30-second and one-minute spots, in the first series of which he was seen in still photograph, but not heard, letting a sonorous voice-over do the work. Later ones, blasting the press, the pundits and the two main parties, have been directed to answering the charge that a vote for Perot 'wasted'. The second piece of evidence that good old attack advertising is not working so well this year, comes from the public itself. In the second presidential debate, in which only the public, not journalists, got to ask the questions, the mood of the audience was crystal clear: we are fed up with smears and character assassination and want to hear more about the issues which affect our lives. Public opinion polls show a similar discontent. This is a bit of a problem for the Bush campaign, with its unremittingly negative advertisements directed at Clinton. Any British visitor remembering the April election will quickly recognise some of them, such as the one which portrays Clinton as a man with two blurred and 'untrustworthy' heads and another which charges, with specific illustrations of 'ordinary' people, that he will slap higher taxes on the middle class. A third claims that Clinton is guilty of a 'pattern of deception,' which is now in Bush's standard campaign speech, as is his denunciation of his opponent's record as governor of Arkansas, which is also enshrined in a commercial. New attack advertisements on Bush's behalf are coming out at a rapid rate. One, aired on the morning after the second debate in St Louis, showed a local eatery with the average Joe and Mary proclaiming that George Bush had 'won' the debate. It transpired that the location was genuine enough but that all those giving their heartfelt opinions were local Republican campaign workers. The Clinton side has not been dilatory with the negative stuff, making many a meal out of Bush's infamous pledge of 1988, 'Read my lips, no new taxes.' Another recalls Bush saying, 'You will be better off four years from now than you are today' and concludes, 'Well, its four years later. How're you doing?' A third has Bush saying, 'I want a kinder, gentler . . .' and the announcer cutting in and saying 'Uh-uh. We can't afford four more years.' Another alleges Bush has used taxpayer money to shift US jobs to central America. Subtle they are not. But its reading of the public mood has also persuaded it to release more 'positive' advertising than has Bush to date. They may not be quite up to the 'morning in America' material that was at the heart of the Reagan re-election campaign in 1984, but they look forward to challenges with hope, rather than backwards in anger. They never forget the economy. Only the election will tell if all this has been money well spent. At the start of the year many US news organisation assigned journalists to the ad watch, on the assumption it would be influential. More now have to get up at dawn and stay up all night for the news that is made on the talk shows.</p>

These LLRTs are currently required to be performed at intervals no greater than 30 months. The one-time schedular exemption would allow Type C LLRTs of the above listed valves to be deferred until the 9/10 refueling outage, which is currently scheduled for the spring of 1996. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By letter dated September 29, 1994, the licensee applied for a Technical Specifications (TSs) amendment and requested an Exemption from the Code of Federal Regulations requirements to allow Type C LLRTs to be deferred for the above listed RHR system valves until the 9/10 refueling outage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> The Need for the Proposed Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The licensee commenced operating on 24-month fuel cycles, instead of the previous 18-month fuel cycles, starting with fuel cycle 9. Fuel cycle 9 started in August 1992. The requirements of 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix J, Paragraph III.D.3, indicate that Type C LLRTs must be performed during each reactor shutdown for refueling at intervals no greater than 2 years (24 months). On January 12, 1993, the NRC staff issued an exemption to the licensee that allowed Type C LLRTs to be performed at intervals up to 30 months, thus, permitting operation on a 24-month fuel cycle. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Approximately 6 months after startup from the 8/9 refueling outage, IP3 began an extended unplanned non-refueling outage. Startup from the outage is currently expected for early 1995. After startup from the current outage, the plant will run until its next scheduled refueling outage (RFO 9/10) which is scheduled to begin in spring of 1996. In November and December of 1994 the RHR containment isolated valves AC&hyph;732, AC&hyph;741, AC&hyph;MOV&hyph;743, AC&hyph;MOV&hyph;744, and AC&hyph;MOV&hyph;1870 are due for their Type C LLRTs. Currently, the interval for Type C testing of these valves is 30 months. These LLRTs are normally performed during a refueling outage when the reactor is defueled and the RHR system is not providing a source of cooling water. The current outage is a non-refueling outage, therefore, the reactor is not defueled and RHR system is providing core cooling water. The licensee's procedure and the system design require the RHR system to be out-of-service in order to perform the LLRTs. If the RHR system is taken out-of-service to perform the LLRTs the reactor would not have a reliable source of cooling water to remove decay heat. Therefore, the licensee is requesting a one-time schedular exemption to allow Type C LLRTs of the above listed valves to be deferred until the 9/10 refueling outage, which is currently scheduled for the spring of 1996.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed one-time exemption does not increase the probability or consequences of accidents previously analyzed and the proposed one-time exemption does not affect facility radiation levels or facility radiological effluents. The licensee has analyzed the results of previous LLRTs performed at IP3, and has provided the methodology used in extrapolating the previous LLRT data to the proposed one time increase in the surveillance interval. The licensee has provided a sound basis for concluding that the containment leakage rate would be maintained within acceptable limits with the one time extension of the LLRT interval to the refueling outage 9/10. Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no significant radiological environmental impacts associated with the proposed exemption. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With regard to potential nonradiological impacts, the proposed exemption only involves LLRTs on containment penetrations and isolation valves. They do not affect nonradiological plant effluents and have no other environmental impact. Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no significant nonradiological environmental impacts associated with the proposed exemption. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Alternatives to the Proposed Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Since the Commission has concluded that there are no significant environmental effects that would result from the proposed exemption, any alternatives with equal or greater environmental impacts need not be evaluated. The principal alternative would be to deny the licensee's request for exemption. Such action would not reduce the environmental impacts of plant operations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Alternative Use of Resources <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This action does not involve the use of resources not previously considered in the ``Final Environmental Statement Related to the Operation of Indian Point Nuclear Generating Plant Unit No. 3,'' dated February 1975. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Agencies and Persons Consulted <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC staff consulted with the New York State official regarding the environmental impact of the proposed action. The State official had no comments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Finding of No Significant Impact <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based on the foregoing environmental assessment, the Commission concludes that the proposed action will not have a significant effect on the quality of the human environment. Accordingly, the Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statement for the exemption under consideration. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For further details with respect to this action, see the licensee's application for exemption dated September 29, 1994.

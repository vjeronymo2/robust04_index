			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / Venezuelan court to rule on Perez VENEZUELA'S supreme court announced yesterday it will rule on May 20 on whether to send President Carlos Andres Perez for trial on corruption charges in a case that could force him from power, Reuter reports from Caracas. Mr Perez and two former ministers face charges of embezzlement and misuse of funds in the purchase of Dollars 17m (Pounds 11m) at a preferential exchange rate and sale of the dollars in the free market for about Dollars 10m in profit. The government has denied the charges but declined to specify how the funds were spent. The 70-year-old president, who has survived two coup attempts, riots and a host of political feuds since taking office in 1989, would have to step aside if put on trial.</p>

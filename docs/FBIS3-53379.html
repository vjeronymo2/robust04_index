The meeting is part of  the committee's continued and intensive efforts to resolve the  political crisis. The committee reached an agreement on a draft  document of pledge and reconciliation among the parties to the  political forces' dialogue to build the modern Yemeni state.  Discussions will continue on some parties' views and  reservations. The meetings were permeated by a good atmosphere  reflecting a spirit of optimism and a sense of the historic  responsibility toward the homeland under the difficult  circumstances it is experiencing. The conferees showed  eagerness to maintain and bolster our people's great  achievements of unity and democracy and to tackle the current  political crisis in a manner that ensures its nonrecurrence in  the future. An emphasis has been placed on laying down the  sound foundations for the building of a modern Yemeni state and  its institutions and a stable system.    It is noteworthy that the basic issues in the draft document  of pledge and reconciliation have been approved, pending a  decision on some reservations and points that are still under  consultation to [word indistinct] and sign the document in its  final and formula.    The session was adjourned this afternoon to give the parties  to the dialogue a chance for further consultations. They will  meet again Saturday morning, 15 January.    An important statement was issued following the meetings of  the political forces' dialogue committee. Following is the text  of the statement:    In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. A  statement to the nation's people issued by the political forces'  dialogue committee on 13 January 1994:    Praise be to God Who says: And hold fast, all together, by  the rope which Allah stretches out for you, and be not divided  among yourselves [Koranic verse]. Peace and blessings be upon  the master of all prophets, the messenger of love and guidance,  who said: No believer shall be considered a believer until he  loves for his brother what he loves for himself.    Our esteemed people: Our beloved country is experiencing a  sharp political crisis which has threatened all the Yemenis'  dreams for a unified, democratic, and developed society. Had it  not been for the grace of God, the wisdom of the sons of Yemen,  and the sincere sentiments of its brothers and friends, Yemen  would have gone down a road which would have distressed its  lovers and pleased its haters. Governed by the logic of reason  and wisdom, the Yemenis have opted for dialogue and tolerance  rather than stubbornness and blind fanaticism. They have also  opted for avoiding rather than obeying destructive tendencies.  All political forces went to the dialogue table after agreeing  on adopting dialogue as the sole way to resolve the crisis and  to settle differences. All parties have agreed to renounce all  forms and means of violence.    The political forces' dialogue committee has started its  work by setting up committees which will work to halt the media,  security, and military repercussions. This is order to provide  a calm atmosphere that is committed to a logical and serious  dialogue. The political forces' dialogue committee has laid down  the necessary measures to halt these repercussions. Despite the  continuation of some repercussions and some parties' violation  of the committee's past decisions, the political forces'  dialogue committee has continued its work effectively. This is  out of its concern for the supreme objectives and to pay no  attention to trivialities.    Through its continued meetings in Sanaa and Aden, the  polticial forces' dialogue committee reached a full agreement on  most issues raised for dialogue. They dealt with the essential  causes of the frequent political crises and the need for radical  solutions to ensure that they do not reoccur. The political  forces' dialogue committee has placed on the table all views,  papers, and proposals that have been raised by political forces  from inside and outside the authority. The dialogue committee  has received important documents on the foundations of the  building of the modern Yemeni state, the state of law and order  and institutions, a state that is based on justice, equality,  freedom, democracy, and decentralization of the local government  system. Such principles are based on the Islamic faith and law  and respect for human rights.    The political forces' dialogue committee had been eager to  accomplish its work within a period not to go beyond 10 January  1994. However, in view of the nature of the dialogue, and out  of their concern about reaching a complete agreement, the  political forces have decided that more time is needed before  such an agreement is reached. It has set 18 January as a final  date for the political forces' dialogue committee to finish the  document of pledge and reconciliation, to set a mechanism and a  timetable for its implementation, and to agree in principle on  the place and date of the ceremonies of singing the document.    The political forces' dialogue committee stressed that the  document is an advanced and important step. However, the  implementation of its contents is the most important step that  is being impatiently awaited by our people. In view of the  importance of following up and monitoring the steps of  implementation, the political forces dialogue committee must  continue to exist as a popular committee to follow up the steps  of implementation and to monitor the abidance of the parties to  the coalition by the timetable of implementation. The committee  should keep the masses apprised of the progress of  implementation and should specify the stands of all parties on  it without equivocation, concealment, or deception.    Pledging before God and the people to be sincere in its  proposals and faithful in its actions, the political forces'  committee asks the parties that have some reservations to put  them aside in the interest of the homeland. It also asks all  parties to avoid anything that would spoil the climate of the  dialogue and exacerbate the situation. They should abide by all  the measures that the committee has approved and vowed before  the people to respect. Whoever disowns his pledge, violates his  commitments, or drags Yemen down a road that neither satisfies  God nor the people--be it through verbal abuses, violations, or  failure to implement what has been committed to--will be held  responsible before history and the people. God testifies to our  sincere intentions.</p>

			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / International Company News: Ciba sales slide 4% to SFr5.69bn CIBA, the Swiss pharma-ceuticals and chemicals group, has reported a 4 per cent slide in consolidated sales in the first quarter to SFr5.69bn (Dollars 3.93bn). Sales in the healthcare sector grew 5 per cent to SFr2.07bn, but this was not enough to offset continuing weakness in the agricultural and industrial chemical sectors. Sales of plant protection products, for example, were down 15 per cent to SFr1.2bn and sales of textile dyes dropped 6 per cent to SFr359m. Sales in the agricultural sector as a whole were down 13 per cent to SFr1.4bn, partly due to seasonal factors, but Ciba said there was a perceptible rise towards the end of the quarter. The growth of sales in the healthcare sector was substantially lower than the levels achieved a year ago. Ciba said it was not possible to repeat the extraordinarily high introductory sales of Habitrol, its nicotine patch to help people stop smoking, achieved during the first quarter of 1992. The group said it still looked for a modest increase in sales in the year as a whole.</p>

			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / International Company News: Time Warner forced to cut Dollars 1bn placement A LACK of sufficient investor interest has forced Time Warner, the debt-laden US media and entertainment group, to slash the size of a recent private placement of long-term notes from Dollars 1bn to Dollars 850m. The company, which plans to use the proceeds to replace bank loans as part of its restructuring of more than Dollars 7bn of group debt, had previously asked Merrill Lynch, lead agent on the transaction, to raise more than Dollars 1bn by way of a private placing. A banker involved in the placing said that Mr Ed Aboodi, financial adviser to Mr Steve Ross, Time Warner chairman, had asked Merrill Lynch to raise the Dollars 1bn by placing Dollars 750m of 10-year senior notes and Dollars 250m of 20-year paper. However institutional investors were not prepared to accept a full Dollars 1bn of Time Warner senior debt, according to an executive involved in the transaction. Time Warner then agreed to reduce the placing to Dollars 500m of 10-year notes paying 9 5/8 per cent and Dollars 250m of 20-year paper at 10.15 per cent. The 10-year tranche was eventually raised to Dollars 600m. Investors were apparently hesitant due to uncertainty over Time Warner's complicated debt restructuring, including a new Dollars 6.2bn bank loan and the transfer of much of the debt to Time Warner Entertainment (TWE), an 87.5 per cent Time Warner subsidiary that will have both Japan's Toshiba and C. Itoh as minority shareholders. The company's ratings, meanwhile, remain below investment grade, although these are expected to be upgraded after the debt rescheduling is completed. After the size of the Time Warner placing was reduced, Merrill Lynch offered the company an additional Dollars 250m as a bridge loan that would eventually be converted into a new 10-year bond with a coupon 200 basis points above the equivalent US Treasury maturity. The bond is expected to be issued in the second half of 1992. This transaction was described by Time Warner as a forward underwriting commitment. By July it should allow the company to reduce its bank loan by the same amount. Time Warner's next step will be to raise a further Dollars 1bn to Dollars 1.5bn cash by seeking to bring US and European partners into its TWE venture with Toshiba and C. Itoh. IBM, the computer company, is among the companies that may be asked to invest up to Dollars 500m in TWE.</p>

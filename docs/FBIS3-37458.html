			<p>Language: <F P=105> Latvian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In the interstate talks between Latvia and Russia on  the functioning of the Skrunda radar station, the delegations  have agreed on all issues except the payment of rent. This was  explained today by Sergey Zotov, the leader of the Russian  delegation. Zotov said that Russia has offered to pay $2  million a year for the use of the Skrunda site. Latvia, for its  part, is demanding an astronomical sum -- $400 million.    In turn, Latvian delegation head Martins Virsis said that  $400 million a year is the figure mentioned by Latvia at the  start of the talks, just as Russia named its sum. Virsis  expressed the view that the site by its nature is not one that  can be bargained for, but there is a possibility that a  compromise could be reached during the talks.    On the question of the number of military personnel  servicing  the Skrunda radar, Zotov explained that Russia has accommodated  Latvia's wishes, and has agreed to reduce their number from 817,  which was initially requested, to 599. Virsis explained that  Russia has not officially agreed to such a number of service  personnel. Virsis noted that in the event the proposal is made  officially, the number of personnel would be considerably  reduced, and obviously the number would be necessary so that the  station could function according to the technological process  envisaged.    However, no agreement has yet been reached during the talks  on the social provision for retired Russian military pensioners.  Zotov stressed that Russia's agreement of a social nature is a  part of the general agreement on the withdrawal of the army and  the agreement on the Skrunda radar. Thereby the agreement on  the withdrawal of the army cannot be signed separately. The  talks will continue on Thursday.</p>

			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Metallgesellschaft There seems to be no end to Metallgesellschaft's problems. Yesterday brought confirmation of a further DM1bn provision in connection with Castle Energy Corporation, which will basically absorb the surplus from the sale of its Buderus engineering subsidiary. The company cannot afford many more nasty surprises of this nature. In selling Buderus, Metallgesellschaft really was disposing of the family silver. It will be increasingly hard to find new assets to sell, but Metallgesellschaft still has a struggle to reduce its debt. Conservation of cash is clearly a primary objective. The new management has cut this year's investment programme in half and imposed a brutal squeeze on working capital. Even so, its own projections still suggest gross debt close to DM5bn by the end of the current year. That is a sizeable sum given the low margins Metallgesellschaft can expect from its trading business at the best of times. Creditors might be reasonably happy with management's efforts at debt service. Deutsche Bank and Dresdner have at least been repaid their emergency loan. But equity investors betting on longer-term recovery must wonder how the company is ever to generate enough earnings for expansion and eventual dividend growth. Since Metallgesellschaft still requires such radical surgery, it is more baffling than ever that its supervisory board originally failed to notice how badly things were going wrong.</p>

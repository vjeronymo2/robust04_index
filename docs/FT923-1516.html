			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Observer: Jumping ship Price Waterhouse, the bean counters with an ever-expanding portfolio of services, has broached intriguing new territory with the latest high-profile recruit to its management consultancy division. Rival Ernst &amp; Young recently hired Christopher Chope, a former transport minister. Now PW, not to be outdone, is to take on Margaret Hodge, the left-wing leader of Islington Borough Council, to advise on local government matters. The culture shock may be considerable; a surprised PW spokesman used to the secretive world of accountants said news of the appointment emerged from the council, which 'leaks like a sieve'. Not so, retorted an outraged Islington bureaucrat who insisted it came from PW. Whatever the truth, Hodge clearly has a strong head for strategic planning. It appears that she had been in discussions with the firm since before the general election.</p>

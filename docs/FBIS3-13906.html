			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] His eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i, the great  leader of the Islamic revolution, gave a speech this afternoon,  on the first day of the New Year, at a gathering of the people  of Mashhad and pilgrims to the holy shrine of the eighth Imam,  Imam Reza.    He described the nature of the dictatorial system ruling the  world. He referred to the false propaganda and machinations of  arrogant powers against Islam and the Iranian nation as clear  signs of their fear of the lofty ideals of the Islamic system.    The great leader of the revolution said the emphasis of the  Muslim nation and government of Iran on the independence of  nations and their sovereignty over their own natural resources  and wealth suits none of the world powers.    He said: Today, no call for justice is raised from any  country except the Iranian nation and Government against the  oppression committed under the blanket of the new order of  domination of nations in the world. That is a fact which is  confirmed and admired by all fair-minded observers throughout  the world.    His eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i said the struggle of the  Iranian nation in the eight-year war imposed by the Iraqi regime  and the unjust powers backing it was a cause for all arrogant  powers to fear the Iranian nation. He said: While the world's  political and economic powers plunder, at the lowest prices, the  natural resources of developing countries, or countries held  back, the Iranian people, with their slogan of independence and  struggle against arrogant powers, continues its course.    The leader of the Islamic revolution said the great and  glorious resistance of the Iranian nation over the past 15 years  has been a source of hope to other nations. Describing the  conspiracies of the ringleaders of arrogance to crush the  resistance of the Iranian nation, he said: America's guileful  remarks in expressing willingness to establish ties with Iran is  not tantamount to its acceptance of past mistakes or an  undertaking to mend its ways in the future. It is a deceitful  and evil move.    The great leader of the Islamic revolution said: America has  said establishing ties with Iran would be subject to the Iranian  nation discarding its fundamental stances. One of which  principles is noninterference by arrogant powers in the affairs  of the Iranian nation. They should know that the great Iranian  nation, which has an ancient culture and a glorious, historical  past, has become like tempered steel after overcoming great  difficulties and would never accept domination by America and  arrogant powers.    Stressing the alertness and presence of every Iranian on  various scenes, the leader of the Islamic revolution said:  Today, a great national, Islamic, and divine movement prevails  throughout Iran and the Iranian nation is proud of what it has  achieved up to now. The president, statesmen, Majles deputies,  and the judiciary officials have all risen from the bosom of the  people and have popular sentiments and direction. And the  country's officials should, in a joint effort with the help of  the people, endeavor to overcome shortages and eradicate  problems. They should traverse this clear course by utilizing  the blessings of Islam, the Koran, divine guidance, and the  Imam's [Khomeyni's] instructions.    Referring to the Koran's verses and wisdom about the  necessity for Muslims to be alert, aware, and watchful the great  leader said: Those who are intoxicated with lust and power are  negligent. They consider as their enemy those who have been  awakened by God's guiding light. Therefore, they are trying to  make them ignorant like themselves and distract them from their  right path. And the Iranian nation, because of its great divine  victory in raising the banner of Islam and making proud the name  of God and the prophets in the world, must today regard the  mention of God's name and divine guidance as a fundamental issue  and shed any negligence in various aspects of its life.

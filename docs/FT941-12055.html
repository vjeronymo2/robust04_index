			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / International Company News: Fokker chief quits after boardroom row The chairman of Fokker, the Dutch aircraft manufacturer which is 51 per cent-owned by Deutsche Aerospace of Germany, has resigned after a board dispute over his plans for a 30 per cent reduction in the price of Fokker's aircraft. Mr Erik Jan Nederkoorn is to be replaced temporarily by Mr Reinder van Duinen, vice-chairman of the management board, until a new chairman drawn from outside the company can be found. Fokker said he had resigned for personal reasons but declined to give details. The cost-cutting plans, unveiled by Mr Nederkoorn in late December, also called for the elimination of around 1,000 jobs. The plans met with opposition from fellow members of the management board as well as Dutch members of the supervisory board, who argued that the cuts were unnecessarily drastic. Dasa, which is reported to have wanted even stiffer cuts, declined to use its majority on the supervisory board to back Mr Nederkoorn in the face of Dutch opposition. Mr Nederkoorn's resignation is unexpected and ironic because he was the driving force behind last year's sale of Fokker to Dasa, a subsidiary of Daimler-Benz.</p>

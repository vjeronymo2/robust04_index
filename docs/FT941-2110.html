			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Survey of Jersey (5): Competition in some fields - The legal services market is more tightly controlled than for accountants. Lawyers need to be qualified in Jersey to practice / Legal and Accountancy Professions Glance through the list of accountancy firms in the Jersey telephone directory, and you might be mistaken for thinking that you were in London, New York or Sydney, so many of the same names arise. All the UK's largest 'big six' firms are present, as well as some of the medium-sized firms, to accompany the local names. The most recent entrant, just three years ago, was Arthur Andersen. Mr Greg Branch, partner in charge of the office, says he now has about 25 staff and is seeing healthy growth. With low unemployment and difficulties in recruitment from the UK, he says one of the firm's real problems is finding new employees. In many ways, the business carried out by the accountants in Jersey is similar to anywhere elsewhere in the world, with accounting, tax and consultancy services all on offer. Mr Branch says demand for consulting, which he imagined would grow only slowly, has proved unexpectedly popular as companies which expanded rapidly in Jersey seek advice on their operations and systems. In the future, there are signs that the accountants' role will expand as a result of new legislation, including the forthcoming financial business law which will require a reporting accountant to verify to the States' supervisors each year that trust companies and other financial services entities comply with requirements. The primary element that skews the accountants' business away from the normal pattern elsewhere is the heavy influence of offshore trusts and company administration work. Coopers &amp; Lybrand, through its subsidiary Abacus, is probably the largest such entity locally. It employs more than 400 people in the Channel Islands, of whom about two-thirds work on trusts and companies. There is certainly a wide variety and growing number of products available, with work required on personal trusts, special purpose vehicles, 'freezer trusts' in which entrepreneurs shield their shareholdings from capital gains tax, and the infamous 'asset protection trusts' designed to safeguard the assets of professionals worried about being sued. In this work, the accountants come into direct competition with lawyers, bankers and other firms offering trust and company administration. 'We are all fulfilling the same function though we approach it from different angles,' says Mr Geoffrey Grime, senior partner of Coopers &amp; Lybrand. The exception to this pattern is Andersen, which has avoided entering trust or company administration work. Mr Branch says this is partly a response to the 'risk-reward ratio', given that great competition means the fees are relatively low, while there are substantial future liabilities if things go awry. However, he also says that taking on the role as a trustee or administrator would risk at the very least the perception of a conflict of interest, with the firm acting effectively as directors of companies which may form part of their own client base. The structure of law firms in Jersey is rather different to the accountants. While a few London practices - such as Gouldens and Theodore Goddard - have established local offices, law is dominated by long-established Jersey-based firms. This may partly reflect the traditionally less aggressive approach of lawyers than accountants in building international works. In addition, the legal services market is more tightly controlled than for accountants. Lawyers need to be qualified in Jersey to practise, which acts as a barrier to entry. Unlike the UK, most law firms include both barristers and solicitors. Each group is currently separately controlled and represented by its own body, although a debate is now in hand about whether the separate bodies should be merged. Mr Jonathan White, a senior advocate with Ogier &amp; Le Cornu, one of Jersey's law firms, says there may have been a modest decline in demand for some types of legal services, although he sees continued growth of commercial litigation. 'Until now there was almost too much work for too few firms,' he says. How do the firms ensure the honesty of their clients - particularly those without a corporate presence on the island who are subject to some independent scrutiny by officials? 'You have to know your client, but it is horrendously difficult to monitor,' says Mr Branch. 'The days when people came in with suitcases full of money are long gone. They have become much more sophisticated.'</p>

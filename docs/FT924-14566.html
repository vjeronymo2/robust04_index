			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / Arts: An uneasy marriage - Opera It is not only rebuilding that is causing disruption at Glyndebourne. A warehouse fire earlier in the year destroyed sets and props, including those for Le nozze di Figaro, which was scheduled to be one of the operas that the touring company would take round the country this autumn. Evidently the plans were too far advanced to change and Glyndebourne Touring Opera has carried on with the Mozart opera anyway. Alongside revivals of Katya Kabanova and The Rake's Progress the company now has the novelty of a new production of its own to mark its first ever London season. Stephen Medcalf is the producer and John Gunter the designer of the new sets, which immediately proclaim a distinct personality. The curtain rises to reveal an aristocratic home of sleek modernity, almost Scandinavian in feel, every surface white and polished, spanking clean. Even the servants' quarters have a touch of class, as though the master of the house felt the least he could do was to furnish his staff with assemble-them-yourself, wall-to-wall cupboards in the latest fashion. The countess lounges in a similarly all-white, sparsely furnished bedroom. The most effective of the designs comes in the last act, where the night-time comedy is played out in a pool of blue light, surrounded by delicately abstract bushes. Unfortunately the huge mask which looms over the scene proves to be a bad omen in more ways than one. At this late stage in the evening the producer has decided to make a point, about reality and charades - a shame, as the rest of the production had been fairly true to the spirit of the opera. The cast has been well chosen. The Count and Countess make a young and handsome pair. As the plot starts to ignite sparks of tension between them, it is easy to believe that this couple still feels the physical attractions and jealousies of a marriage's early years. Ralf Lukas brings a promising baritone voice to the Count's music and Juliet Booth is a generously-sung Countess, though she was not entirely happy with her second aria. The resentment felt below stairs was well caught by Nicholas Folwell's determined Figaro and Regina Nathan's nicely-sung Susanna, though neither has the sparkling Latin temperament that their music supposes. Julie Unwin played a sensitive Cherubino, who knew exactly what he was doing. The moment when he lured the Countess unwittingly into his arms was a well-judged observation from a production that generally kept to the usual moves. Led by Neil Jenkins's amusing Benny Hill-lookalike Don Basilio, the smaller roles are cast from strength. The music moves briskly in the hands of Marco Guidarini, who conducts Mozart in a recognisably Italian style, sharp and clear, but without the ability to find give-and-take within the musical numbers. Still, the pace on stage is not allowed to slacken. On balance the performance is just sharp enough to make it worth investigating. Le nozze di Figaro, Sadler's Wells, sponsored by N M Rothschild &amp; Sons Ltd. and Rothschild &amp; Cie Banque. Four further performances in London (Box Office 071-278 8916) then touring.</p>

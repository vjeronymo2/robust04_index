			<p><P> July 20, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: AZUSA;  </P> <P> SWAP MEET PLAN DROPPED  </P> <P> The owners of Edwards-Pacific Drive-In Theaters have withdrawn their  application to expand a once-weekly Saturday swap meet to Saturdays and  Sundays.  </P> <P> In recent years, the swap meet has become unpopular with nearby residents, who  complain about the traffic, lack of parking and the run-down appearance of the  drive-in on Foothill Boulevard. Under pressure from the city, the Edwards  family has made improvements to the facade of the 1960s theater. But traffic  and parking problems persist.  </P> <P> In May, the Planning Commission recommended that the city deny the proposal by  the Edwards family, citing the adverse effect on the community. Edwards had  been scheduled to appeal the matter before the City Council last Monday.  </P> <P> Edwards' attorney Lawrence H. Davidson said the Edwardses "want to be a good  neighbor and there was opposition by the community, and they want to evaluate  that."  </P> <P> The family has given no indication about their plans for the site, Davidson  said.  </P> <P> The city is interested in exploring a redevelopment deal with Edwards to modify  the 30-acre property's commercial-use zoning and will approach Edwards in the  near future, City Administrator Julio J. Fuentes said.  </P> <P> In the meantime, the city is considering adopting an ordinance that would  require swap-meet operators to obtain a conditional-use permit, which could  impose new conditions on the operation of swap meets within the city.  </P></p>

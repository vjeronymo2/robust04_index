			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Abbott Mead wins BT contract Abbott Mead Vickers, the advertising agency, has landed what it claims is the 'largest single new business win in the history of British advertising', with a contract from British Telecommunications worth Pounds 50m in annual billings. The agency's shares rose 27p to close at 660p. BT said the agency's brief was to increase the personal use of telephones. Domestic use is 25-30 per cent lower in the UK than in the US and the network is a 'very under-utilised fixed asset,' said BT. The aim was to encourage people to make more calls and stay on the phone for longer. There has been concern within BT that since the days of the 'Beattie' campaign, which was devised by J Walter Thompson, part of the WPP group, the organisation's advertising had become too fragmented. Recent campaigns had been divided between agencies Simons Palmer Denton Clemmow and Johnson, and Saatchi &amp; Saatchi. The latest move to AMV will consolidate all personal telephone advertising under one roof. Simons Palmer and Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, as well as BMP DDB Needham, pitched against AMV for the latest campaign. AMV has done work for BT before: it devised its Yellow Pages advertising and is also working on raising awareness of code changes planned for next year.</p>

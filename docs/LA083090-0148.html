			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COOK IT LIGHT: ANOTHER COOL IDEA  </P> <P> This dish is ideal for summer entertaining because it's cold, it can be made a  day ahead of time, and it looks terrific. To make an even prettier presentation  I like to garnish the platter with edible flowers, such as nasturtiums,  whenever they are available.  </P> <P> The reason the chicken is removed from the heat just slightly undercooked is  because it will continue to cook as it cools in the liquid. If overcooked,  chicken becomes tough and less flavorful.  </P> <P> PARTY CHICKEN PLATTER  </P> <P> 6 whole chicken breasts, boned, skinned and halved  </P> <P> 1 cup coarsely chopped celery  </P> <P> 1 cup coarsely chopped onion  </P> <P> 1 carrot, peeled and sliced  </P> <P> 1 bunch fresh parsley (including stems and leaves), chopped  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon salt  </P> <P> Dash white pepper  </P> <P> 2 cups dry white wine, about  </P> <P> 1 envelope unflavored gelatin  </P> <P> 3 tablespoons water  </P> <P> 1 bay leaf  </P> <P> 1/2 cup calorie-reduced mayonnaise  </P> <P> 1/2 cup finely minced parsley  </P> <P> Cucumber slices, carrot curls, pimiento strips, radish roses, optional  </P> <P> Remove all visible fat from chicken. Place chicken in large saucepan and add  celery, onion, carrot and 1 bunch chopped parsley. Mix salt and pepper with  wine and pour over chicken mixture. If mixture is not completely covered, add  little more wine. Bring to slow boil over medium heat. Cover and simmer until  chicken breasts are slightly underdone, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat and  allow to cool to room temperature.  </P> <P> Remove chicken from pan, reserving liquid, and arrange on large platter. Cover  tightly and refrigerate.  </P> <P> Return reserved poaching liquid to heat and bring to boil. Strain and reserve 1  3/4 cups. Soften gelatin in water. Add to reserved liquid and mix until gelatin  is thoroughly dissolved. Add bay leaf and allow mixture to come to room  temperature. Chill until slightly jelled, about 1 hour. Then remove and discard  bay leaf. Add mayonnaise to gelatin mixture, mixing thoroughly with wire whisk.  </P> <P> Remove chicken from refrigerator and spoon gelatin mixture over each breast,  covering entire platter. Sprinkle 1/2 cup minced parsley evenly over all. Cover  and refrigerator until mixture is firmly jelled, about 3 hours. Garnish with  cucumber slices, carrot curls, pimiento strips and radish roses. Makes 12  servings.  </P></p>

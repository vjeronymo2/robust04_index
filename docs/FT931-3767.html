			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Drinks sector The near 10 per cent relative decline of the UK drinks sector this year reflects not only its fading defensive attraction. Alcohol is an obvious target for a chancellor wrestling with a PSBR of more than Pounds 40bn. Not surprisingly, the industry is busy inventing reasons why increased duties could be counter-productive. The tax take might suffer when domestic consumption of beer and spirits is dropping and personal imports from the continent are growing. Where beer is concerned, these arguments look self-serving. Duty indexation would add less than 1p to the price of a pint. That is much less than the large price increases imposed a couple of years ago by brewers and which contributed heavily to the fall in demand. Slight over-indexation of duty would not now make matters significantly worse. Though personal imports account for nearly 10 per cent of the take-home trade, the share was 6 per cent before allowances were increased in January. The trend will be clearer by the November Budget. The spirits case is stronger. The alcohol in spirits is taxed more heavily than in beer and wine, and markedly more than in cider. High UK duty undermines producers' ability to argue against duty increases in European export markets. But EC harmonisation is a long-term issue. There have been some sharp wholesale price increases in spirits this year. The stock market is probably right to assume that the chancellor will be letting those responsible off lightly if he opts for mere indexation.</p>

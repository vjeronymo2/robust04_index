			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] China intends to join the General Agreement on  Tariffs and Trade (GATT) within this year. The Ministry of  Foreign Affairs [MOFA] positively supports this plan and is  moving to call on the international community to "let China join  it at an early date." This is because the MOFA has judged that  "incorporating China into the framework of a market economy will  eventually promote its reform." Japan also plans to take the  initiative in holding bilateral tariff talks with China, which  are preliminary steps to joining GATT, and appeal for "speeding  up the procedures for China's admission" at the GATT's Uruguay  Round ministerial conference to be held in Marrakech, Morocco,  in April for signing the accord.    The current situation indicates that the World Trade  Organization (WTO) will likely be inaugurated six months ahead  of the original schedule. An accord was reached at the Uruguay  Round talks that GATT will be changed into WTO in July 1995. It  is with this background that Japan has started assisting China's  early admission. If China should fail to obtain GATT membership  within this year, it will also fail to become a founding WTO  member. Then, China will have to once again start its  application for the WTO membership after its inauguration. In  this case, it is most likely that China's participation will be  further delayed.    A senior MOFA official expressed his concern, and said: "If  China is kept out of the WTO, the multinational rules in world  trade will not be perfect." Moreover, the MOFA aims at  indirectly checking the United States by having China admitted  into the WTO system.    In a bid to win the membership before the year ends, China  has been engaged in improving its trade conditions at home. For  example, the dual exchange rates for the yuan were unified into  one early this year. In March, GATT will hold working-level  panel meetings on China's participation. However, in connection  with the issue of renewal of the most-favored-nation status for  China, the United Stated has indicated a cautious stance on  China's GATT admission. Thus, if the current state is left  unchanged, China may face a delicate situation regarding its  GATT participation within this year.</p>

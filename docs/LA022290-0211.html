			<p><P> February 22, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CITY SECTION BASEBALL PREVIEWS  </P> <P> * Teams listed in predicted order of finish.  </P> <P> NORTHWEST VALLEY CONFERENCE  </P> <P> North Valley League  </P> <P> Kennedy  </P> <P> COACH: Manny Alvarado, 2nd year  </P> <P> LAST SEASON: 22-7; 1st in league at 12-4  </P> <P> PLAYERS TO WATCH: Kennedy won its third City Section 4-A Division title of the  decade last season behind a group of talented seniors. The band included City  MVP Gino Tagliaferri, All-Valley infielder Mike Murray and three-year starter  Pat DeBoer. Yet, even with those standouts in the lineup, All-City junior  Garret Anderson batted cleanup -- and did he mop up statistically. Anderson,  who bats left-handed and plays in the outfield, hit .362 with five home runs  and 31 runs batted in. He led area juniors in RBIs in City play. Anderson is  not the lone threat, however. Catcher Lazaro Campos, who hit .367, is back for  his third season of varsity play and will bat cleanup behind Anderson. Troy  Bourne, a reserve last year, will start at first. James Bernas, an all-league  member of the junior varsity, will start at second. Either Billy Ramirez or  Rich Trujillo will fill Tagliaferri's slot at short. Palmer Drain, used as a  designated-hitter last year, starts at third. Ben Guzman, Jason Rosen, Mitchell  Drain and Birmingham transfer Jack Moussa (.266, nine RBIs) are in a fight for  the remaining outfield berths. The pitching corps has been through it all  before. Left-hander Denny Sharp (7-2, 3.75 earned-run average, 108 strikeouts  in 84 innings) might possess the best curveball in the area.  </P> <P> Junior right-hander Cody Beaumaster (4-1, 2.13 ERA) is the No. 2 starter.  However, Sharp (67 walks) and Beaumaster (15 walks in 19 2/3 innings) will need  better control if the Golden Cougars want to make it two titles in a row.  </P> <P> OUTLOOK: "Last year at this time pitching was our big question mark," Alvarado  said. "Now that seems to be one of our strengths." Last year's strength was the  infield. That also has changed. "It's one of the strongest outfield teams I've  ever been associated with," Alvarado said. "As long as we can catch it and  throw it, we'll be in good shape."  </P> <P> San Fernando  </P> <P> COACH: Steve Marden, 14th year  </P> <P> LAST SEASON: 16-7-1; 2nd in league at 10-5-1  </P> <P> PLAYERS TO WATCH: If San Fernando makes a run at Kennedy for the league title,  it will be behind the strength of its pitching staff. John Najar, a utility  player last season as a junior, has been converted into a pitcher and Marden is  pleased with what he sees. "He could be the most dominant pitcher I've seen all  winter," Marden said. Hector De La Cruz, a three-year letterman, returns for  his senior year. De La Cruz (6-1, 3.42 ERA, 58 strikeouts in 58 1/3 innings), a  left-hander, included among his victories an upset of Chatsworth on the road.  Left-hander Canto Franco, the junior varsity league MVP last year, and  sophomore right-hander Rick Savala are also in the running for a place in the  rotation. "With a lefty and righty in the starting rotation and a lefty and  righty in the bullpen, we look real strong with our pitching," Marden said. Two  starting position players return: third baseman Richard (Shorty) Sanchez and  outfielder Octavio Serrano. Fernando Ortega and Roy Aguilera, reserves last  year, are among a large group fighting for outfield berths. Marden's biggest  discovery could be shortstop Luis Rodriguez, a switch-hitting sophomore.  Rodriguez follows in the footsteps of All-City shortstops Bobby Corrales (1989)  and Albert Torrez (1988). "He's going to be better than both of them before  he's through," Marden predicted.  </P> <P> OUTLOOK: The 1990 Tigers are similar to their predecessors in almost every  respect, Marden said, and status quo is fine with him. "The key for us is to do  what we do well -- put the ball in play, have solid pitching and play good  defense," Marden said. "We play for one run an inning." Where do they rate? "We  may not be as strong as some teams we've had in terms of returning starters,"  he said. "But nobody else does, either, except maybe for El Camino (Real)."  </P> <P> Granada Hills  </P> <P> COACH: Darryl Stroh, 21st year  </P> <P> LAST SEASON: 4-16; 4th in league at 1-15  </P> <P> PLAYERS TO WATCH: Last season, Stroh's 20th as coach, was the worst in his  tenure, a career that includes five 4-A City titles. Are his players intent on  proving that 1989 was a fluke? Stroh says he doesn't know, and for good reason.  "We haven't spent any time talking about last year," he said. Based on the  early returns, '89 might have been an anomaly. The Highlanders won seven of  eight games in winter-league play, Stroh said, and have been opening some eyes  -- namely his own. "I've been pleasantly surprised," he said. Right-hander Gabe  Miller returns as does left-hander Mike Komsky. Another familiar face will  brace the pitching staff -- football quarterback Bryan Martin. The younger  brothers of two former Highlander standouts will play at first. Josh Leach,  whose brother Jeremy played football and baseball, will see time at first along  with Robert Fowble, whose brother Greg also was a two-sport player. Second base  will be manned by either Todd Williams or Darryl Stroh Jr. Shortstop Jon  Condos, a returning starter, "has looked outstanding," Stroh said. Gabe Padilla  or Derrick Cole will start at third. The outfield likely will consist of  Martin, Alex Vasquez and Eric Anderson. Scott Berger, the lone sophomore on the  team, also might play in the outfield. Andy Petroski, a kicker on the football  team, is the catcher.  </P> <P> OUTLOOK: Stroh says the team strength is undeniably its defense, "but it'll all  boil down to the pitching," he said. The team's superlative performance in  winter ball has left Stroh guardedly optimistic. "We won seven of eight and we  played well," he said, "but we won something like three out of four last year  too."  </P> <P> Cleveland  </P> <P> COACH: Rich Raymond, 1st year  </P> <P> LAST SEASON: 7-12-1; 3rd in league at 5-10-1  </P> <P> PLAYERS TO WATCH: With the exception of returning All-City outfielder Pat  Bryant, the Cavaliers' strength also appears to be on the pitching rubber. A  pair of right-handers, Bobby Macias (5-11, 175) and Bobby McRae (6-5, 175), are  the likely starters. McRae, who starts on the basketball team and will be a  late arrival, was 2-5 with a 3.26 ERA last year. Sophomores Mike Petruzates,  Robert Rundquist and Mario Macias, Bobby's brother, also will pitch.  Right-hander Steve Pressler is a possible relief specialist. Petruzates and  McRae will alternate at first when not pitching. Sophomore Julio Marcial will  start at second and David Sipolla -- who batted a team-high .465 last year on  the junior varsity -- will play shortstop. Mike Sutyak, a junior, is the third  baseman. Macias and Petruzates are probable starters in the outfield. Bryant, a  senior who will start in center and bat first, hit .464 and stole 21 bases last  year. Both marks ranked first among returning area City players. He also drove  in 14 runs and recorded team highs in doubles (five) and home runs (four).  </P> <P> OUTLOOK: Raymond coached the Cleveland junior varsity last year, so he is  familiar with the many youngsters who populate the Cavs' roster. He knows their  strengths, their limitations. "Our sophomores are highly skilled," he said.  "Some have played for those world championship teams in Encino . . . but we're  awful green and young." If the pitching comes through as expected and the  defense holds up -- a couple of big ifs -- Cleveland might well knock off some  of the 4-A title contenders.  </P> <P> West Valley League  </P> <P> El Camino Real  </P> <P> COACH: Mike Maio, 8th year  </P> <P> LAST SEASON: 9-8; 3rd in league at 9-7  </P> <P> PLAYERS TO WATCH: First things first. Maio wants everyone to be aware of one  thing: "I'm trying very hard to keep American Legion and El Camino baseball  separate." It might be a tall order. The Woodland Hills West Legion team won  the World Series title in August, and the majority of its players were from El  Camino Real. Included on the West team were Ryan McGuire (first base), Pat  Treend (pitcher), Jason Cohen (left field), Bobby Kim (catcher), Jeff Marks  (right field), Greg Lederman (third base), Chris Castillo (outfield), Gregg  Sheren (infield), Chris Teich (infield) and Sean Boldt (pitcher). Of the group,  five were regulars. And if that's not enough, Herman Merchan (utility), who  excelled at St. Genevieve High and on the Panorama City Legion team,  transferred to El Camino Real over the summer. Seeking places on the pitching  staff are Corey Bromberg, Daniel Costa, Terry Morrow and Josh Massey. Maio's  toughest sell? "I really believe that there are 15 teams in the Valley that can  beat us. . . . The notoriety they received doesn't mean a thing now." Boldt, a  junior transfer from Canyon, might be a key. McGuire, a hard-throwing  left-hander, was effective during Legion play in late relief and would make an  ideal closer. If Boldt falters, however, the UCLA-bound McGuire might be used  in the starting rotation.  </P> <P> OUTLOOK: This team has been tabbed by many -- including most of the coaches in  the conference -- as the one to beat. Maio bristles at the thought. "Look at  all the No. 1 teams who lose. Granada Hills in football, Chatsworth was ranked  No. 1 in the nation (in baseball) by USA Today a couple of years ago and they  didn't win it, USC lost to Northridge (in baseball)," he said. Are the players  responding? "I think they're listening. I think I've made an impression."  </P> <P> Chatsworth  </P> <P> COACH: Tom Meusborn, 1st year  </P> <P> LAST SEASON: 21-7; 1st in league at 12-4  </P> <P> PLAYERS TO WATCH: One of the most successful programs in the state, Chatsworth  has won or shared nine consecutive league titles. The good news for Meusborn is  that Chatsworth isn't favored to win the title this season. "It doesn't make  that much difference to me," he said. "We're going to play them game to game,  week to week. It won't make me happy to read that we're favored to win and it  won't make me mad if we're not favored." Right-hander Reed McMackin, part of  the Chancellors' starting rotation a year ago, returns after posting an 8-2  record with a 4.02 ERA. Left-hander Danny Rodriguez, a standout on the junior  varsity last year, is the probable No. 2 starter. Mitch Root, who will start in  center field, will be the closer. Soly Maya (first base), Nestor Martinez  (second), Tommy Lee (shortstop) and Adam Pearlman (third) all played for the  junior varsity in 1989. Outfielder Rodney Bloom and catcher Mike Mancuso are  returning lettermen. Scott Carpenter is scheduled to play in right. "When you  look at the roster, you see we have 11 seniors," Meusborn said. "We're older  than most teams, but experience-wise, we're sort of green."  </P> <P> OUTLOOK: "I think we have some good pitching," Meusborn said. "With Rodriguez  and McMackin, we'll be in pretty good shape." Chatsworth is strong up the  middle with Mancuso, Martinez, Lee and Root. But there is a preponderance of  new names. Derek Wallace, Eric Johnson, Jason Evans and Rich Aude -- all of  whom were both drafted and received scholarship offers -- have graduated.  Perhaps Meusborn will soon find out the true strength of the Chatsworth  program.  </P> <P> Taft  </P> <P> COACH: Rich McKeon, 3rd year  </P> <P> LAST SEASON: 16-11; 2nd in league at 11-5  </P> <P> PLAYERS TO WATCH: McKeon is left to sort through what remains of a  senior-dominated team that a year ago gave Chatsworth a run for the league  title. Returning starters include Benji Belfield, a shortstop-relief pitcher  who had three saves and was 4-3 with a 4.94 ERA. Belfield also ranked among the  team's offensive leaders with seven extra-base hits and 15 RBIs. Brett Reisner  (.246, 10 RBIs) returns in the outfield. Jamie Zeichick, a reserve last season  after having off-season shoulder surgery, will start in the outfield and bat  fourth. The pitching staff is deep but untested. Battling for starting berths  are senior left-hander Ryan Revel, sophomore left-hander Cory Jacobson, junior  right-hander Eddie Soto and sophomore right-handers Sean Collins and Michael  Krasner. Carey Wilbur, a varsity reserve last season as a junior, will start at  catcher. Sophomore John Erganian will play first base, freshman Warren Stewart  and sophomore Matt Allison are battling it out at second, and freshman Brandon  Witkow and Krasner are doing likewise at third. Darnell Hendricks, a speedy  junior, will start in right.  </P> <P> OUTLOOK: "I'm hoping that we'll have a combination of leadership and youth,"  McKeon said. McKeon also might have to rely on team speed to manufacture runs  if the offense falters, a possibility given the experience of the team. "We  probably have the quickest outfield around," he said. "We may rely on team  speed in the top of the order." The team has more pitching depth than in the  past, but experience is nil. Only Belfield has pitched at the varsity level.  </P> <P> Canoga Park  </P> <P> COACH: Jim Smith, 2nd year  </P> <P> LAST SEASON: 3-13; 4th in league at 3-13  </P> <P> PLAYERS TO WATCH: Smith is frank about the Hunters' chances. "We've basically  got no pitching," he said. Senior left-hander Doug Van Horn, ineligible last  season, is the only player certain to see time on the mound. Ineligibility has  ravaged the team. "We have 11, maybe 12 kids out," he said. "We lost five kids  to grades." Mike Bruce, a returning starter, will catch. "He has a real good  arm," Smith said, which makes Bruce a possible pitching candidate. Returning  lettermen Curt Sazzman and Valentine Douglas are waging a war for the nod at  shortstop; the loser will play elsewhere in the infield. Doug Kreider, a  returning starter, will play at third. Mike Lewis returns in the outfield. Greg  Hurst also will play in the outfield. Leo Roldan is a possible starter at  second, and Scott Blemker and Van Horn are expected to split time at first.  </P> <P> OUTLOOK: "The only thing we did decent in winter league was field the ball,"  Smith said. "We faced some pretty weak pitching and didn't do too well against  that." Prospects don't look good, but Smith remains upbeat. "We'll have fun,"  he said. "But I think it's going to be a long year."  </P> <P> VALLEY PAC-8 CONFERENCE  </P> <P> Mid-Valley League  </P> <P> Birmingham  </P> <P> COACH: Wayne Sink, 26th year  </P> <P> LAST SEASON: 8-12; 3rd in league at 6-10  </P> <P> PLAYERS TO WATCH: A team of vast experience appropriately will play for Sink in  his 26th and final campaign as head coach. Nine returnees, headed by  outfielders Bob Bookatz and Danny Larson, will be counted on for power. Bookatz  batted .420 as a junior. Larson led City players in triples with six. Also  coming back is senior infielder Justin Bass, who batted .343 in '89. The list  of veterans also includes catchers Seth Rosenzweig and Marc Feder, pitchers  Josh Brown and Jason Mansfield, probable leadoff hitter Ruben Flores and  infielder-pitcher Matt Mowry. "It's a good nucleus to work with," Sink said.  Players up from the junior varsity who will play key roles include first  baseman Mike Belasco, first baseman-pitcher Noah Kirshbaum, left fielder Mike  Malki and outfielder Adam Kallen. Brown and Kirshbaum are the right-handed  starting pitchers and Mansfield is the lone left-handed starting pitcher. Mawry  should pitch some short relief.  </P> <P> OUTLOOK: Sink is open in evaluating his swan song. "What we have is  experience," he said. "And the rest is up to them. They could have a great  season if they're motivated. But I can't go out there and hit that curveball."  The primary goal, Sink says, is the playoffs. But he would like to build from  there.  </P> <P> Monroe  </P> <P> COACH: Kevin Campbell, 5th year  </P> <P> LAST SEASON: 11-11; 1st in league at 8-8  </P> <P> PLAYERS TO WATCH: Monroe begins this season with something most teams would  love to have: a veteran pitcher. Sean Henson is a senior who ranked fourth  among Valley-area City pitchers last season with a 2.08 earned-run average in  64 innings. Henson also will play first base. Other returnees include shortstop  and leadoff hitter John Langley, power-hitting outfielder Jeff Rubell and  outfielder Jim Rose. Joining Henson in the rotation will be a pair of  sophomores: Christian Ascencio, who doubles as a first baseman, and Adrian  Loverich. "One of those two will have to be a starter," Campbell said. The rest  of the lineup is solid. San Fernando transfer Mario Gonzalez is a junior left  fielder with good speed. Seniors Fran Espinosa and Chad Majers will play second  base and third base, respectively.  </P> <P> OUTLOOK: With Henson, Monroe has a proven winner on the mound. "Obviously,  right now the question would be who will be our No. 2 starter," Campbell said.  Defensively, the coach likes what he sees. As far as run production, Campbell  pegs that as a gray area. "We need to improve our offense," he said. "If we can  get the ball in play, we'll be OK."  </P> <P> Van Nuys  </P> <P> COACH: Bill Gordon, 1st year  </P> <P> LAST SEASON: 7-10; 2nd in league at 7-9  </P> <P> PLAYERS TO WATCH: The biggest news so far during Gordon's short stay at Van  Nuys is, unfortunately, bad: Returning all-league senior shortstop Lorenzo  Morales suffered pulled ligaments in his arm and is wearing a cast. "Hopefully,  he'll return in three to four weeks," Gordon said. "I say hopefully. He's our  best kid." In the meantime, Gordon looks to other returnees for leadership.  Junior third baseman Hector Alvarenga is a letterman who will play shortstop  until Morales returns. Seniors Martin Ramos (first base) and Carlos Gonzalez  (outfield) also will start. The rest of the team is dominated by juniors,  especially the pitching. The top two starters are 11th-graders Tony Gonzalez  and Jayme Jimenez, a pair of "junk-ballers," according to Gordon. Morales, when  he returns, will relieve. Juniors David Gomez and Jesus Enciso join Gonzalez in  the outfield. Rare seniors in the lineup include second baseman Carlos  Gutierrez and catcher Marcos Espino. A positive note for Gordon has been the  emergence of sophomore Patrick Alvarado, who "is looking really good" at third  base, according to Gordon.  </P> <P> OUTLOOK: Gordon is cautiously optimistic. "We want to be in every game," he  said. "But our primary goal is the playoffs." While Morales is gone, Gordon  will miss him like a soldier pining for home. In the meantime, Gordon looks  ahead with a bright eye. "We've got to at least let them know that they've been  in a ballgame," he said. "We have the makings of a pretty darn good team."  </P> <P> Reseda  </P> <P> COACH: Mike Stone, 12th year  </P> <P> LAST SEASON: 4-14; 4th in league at 1-14  </P> <P> PLAYERS TO WATCH: Stone is nearly positive that this year's team will fare  better than last season's largely because of the emergence of steady -- albeit  green -- pitching staff. A pair of sophomores -- Jesse Yeomans and Bebo  Granello -- will start on the mound. Two football players -- Robert Reynoso and  Mike McCarthy -- will provide relief. Reseda's run production will be aided by  veterans, notably junior Louis Vanacore, who batted .460 to finish third in the  Valley-area City batting race. He is joined by ex-football players Joe Tushnet,  a shortstop-center fielder who will bat first and provide speed, and Tuti  Rodriguez, a first baseman who will bat fourth. "I'm expecting those guys to be  real solid .300 to .400 hitters," Stone said. The team's best player, according  to Stone, is freshman David Barbares, a shortstop who won't join the team until  he's academically eligible in 10 weeks. "He's gonna be a good one," Stone said.  </P> <P> OUTLOOK: One thing is for sure, according to Stone: "We're going to be a lot  better than last year. Last year, we had no pitching. This year, we're in  better shape. This year, we'll be there in the seventh inning." The big  variable, the coach says, will be the Regents' run production. "It's a matter  of offense," he said.  </P> <P> East Valley League  </P> <P> Sylmar  </P> <P> COACH: Gary Donatella, 2nd year  </P> <P> LAST SEASON: 19-4; 1st in league at 14-2  </P> <P> PLAYERS TO WATCH: Sylmar lost three top pitchers from last season's City  semifinalists but that shouldn't stop Donatella's team from again making noise.  Leading the way is Joe Contreraz, a senior third baseman who batted .351 last  season and was second among City area players in doubles with eight. Contreraz  will team with junior pitcher-outfielder Dereck Orneles in the heart of the  order. Orneles can run, swing the bat and pitch, according to Donatella.  Joining Orneles on the mound will be junior James Encinas, the team's top  pitcher. Seniors Gonzalo Hernandez and Danny Garcia also will pitch along with  sophomore Jimmy Lemos. Leadoff hitter David Romero is a senior outfielder.  UCLA-bound football player London Woodfin will provide power (he hit .343 last  year) when he returns in early April from arthroscopic knee surgery. Shortstop  Roberto Garcia is sure-handed.  </P> <P> OUTLOOK: Sylmar has the makings of another fine team. What this year's team  lacks in quality pitching, Donatella said, it makes up for in quantity of  reliable pitchers. "Pitching is the key," he said. Scoring runs should be  little problem with Contreraz, Orneles and Woodfin. Said Donatella: "We're  going to be around the top."  </P> <P> Poly  </P> <P> COACH: Jerry Cord, 15th year  </P> <P> LAST SEASON: 15-9; 3rd in league at 11-5  </P> <P> PLAYERS TO WATCH: Six returning lettermen join a group of talented young  players, a mix that bodes well for the Parrots. Cord will look to senior  right-hander David Giatti, whose strong junior season was cut short by arm  trouble that still hounds him. In 46 innings, Giatti led Valley-area City  pitchers with a 1.22 ERA. "He's been throwing," Cord said. "But who knows how  he'll come back?" Joining Giatti in the rotation will be senior right-hander  Eddie Castellanos, who doubles as a designated-hitter. "We're counting on those  two to be mainstays," Cord said. Junior pitchers, including Rodrigo Dorame and  Raul Torres, will get a chance to pitch. Other leading returnees are position  players. Senior shortstop Gabe Chavez and junior outfielder Jonathan Campbell  are powerful hitters. The top of the order includes second baseman Roy Lozano  and leadoff hitter Will Molina, a center fielder. Much of the youth comes from  the 1989 Encino Pony League World champions: sophomores Steve Chavez (catcher),  Jesus Perez (outfielder) and Francisco Flores (first baseman).  </P> <P> OUTLOOK: Poly has a legitimate shot at the title, but much depends on Giatti's  recovery. "We're not gonna make a lot of mistakes defensively," Cord said. "We  can make contact and score runs. The pitching is the only question. Somebody  has to step forward."  </P> <P> Grant  </P> <P> COACH: Tom Lucero, 14th year  </P> <P> LAST SEASON: 16-5; 2nd in league at 12-3  </P> <P> PLAYERS TO WATCH: Talk about youth: Grant has two returning lettermen, and one  of them is still playing basketball. That leaves senior second baseman Steve  Pelote as the team's lone returning starter when play gets under way.  Accordingly, Pelote will be counted on for big things. He batted .368 and drove  in 25 runs last season. The other returnee is pitcher Billy May, a reserve  forward on the basketball team. Lucero's No. 1 pitcher will be junior  right-hander Gary Rosoff. Junior soccer player Holvik Castro pitched well in  last year's playoffs. More youth can be found in sophomore right-hander Tony  Kuper, a transfer from Antelope Valley. The lineup is somewhat shrouded in  mystery at this point. Senior catcher Steve Gordon, junior second baseman  Brandon Long and junior outfielder Shane Williams figure to bid for attention.  </P> <P> OUTLOOK: The football and basketball teams already have won league titles,  placing the onus on Lucero's group to follow suit. Lucero says that the goals  are there -- "Obviously, we want to win the league title. We always shoot for  that." -- but the bodies remain in question. "Having just two returners makes  it difficult," he said. "It's not like the past where I could rely on a Rodney  Beck or a Javier Delahoya. We're trying to find the right combinations. We're  so young and so competitive. There's some enthusiasm."  </P> <P> North Hollywood  </P> <P> COACH: Marty Biegel, 1st year  </P> <P> LAST SEASON: 3-13; 4th in league at 3-13  </P> <P> PLAYERS TO WATCH: The first name Biegel mentions when discussing the team uad  is senior shortstop Eric Martinez. "He's got All-City potential," he said.  Biegel also praises No. 3 hitter and football star Mike Lewis. Two pieces of  the puzzle will not report until after the basketball season: first baseman  Harry Marks and leadoff hitter-center fielder Duane Braxton. "Duane's my table  setter," Biegel said. "He's got great speed and he's a great defensive  outfielder." Biegel's top two pitchers are right-handers Sammy Ciaramarilo and  Craig White, a junior varsity basketball player. The outfield contains good  fielders in Nelson Pichardo and Ozzie Collins. Second baseman Carlos Olmos, an  Orel Hershiser lookalike, according to Biegel, along with infielders Adrian  Padilla and Charlie Lee will see playing time. Three are vying for the  catcher's job: Steve Macias, Livan Cartaya and Ivan Guillermo. Jose Ortiz also  could squeeze in some playing time for Biegel.  </P> <P> OUTLOOK: "We'll go as far as our pitching carries us," Biegel said. "We will  score runs, that I know." And with Biegel, the ebullient New Yorker at the  helm, there is no shortage of enthusiasm. "The kids have been absolutely  beautiful in their accepting of a new guy on the block," he said. As for the  league race? "We'll be competitive," the coach assured.  </P> <P> NORTHERN CONFERENCE  </P> <P> Northeastern League  </P> <P> Verdugo Hills  </P> <P> COACH: David Richard, 1st year  </P> <P> LAST SEASON: 12-12; 3rd in league at 9-7  </P> <P> PLAYERS TO WATCH: For the first time, the Dons will have an on-campus baseball  diamond. And despite having just one returning varsity player, Richard might  have carved out a respectable team to play at the new facility too. "Whenever a  new guy comes into a program, they always say it'll take a year," said Richard,  20, a walk-on and former junior varsity coach at Marshall. "But I told the  kids, 'Let's start now.' There's no reason to shine this year off." Pat  Hernandez, who starts at third base, is the lone returning letterman, and he  will be expected to anchor an infield of considerable inexperience. First  baseman Stan Hessinger, second baseman Larry Gouger and shortstop Pat Eubanks  all are sophomores. There are two sophomores in the outfield, Matt Ward and Ray  Medina. Richard calls Ward, "the one to watch." Senior Jeff Martinez starts in  left. The pitching staff, which Richard calls his main concern, consists of  right-handed seniors Chad Runnels and Scott Boudreaux and junior right-hander  John Bishop. "If we get the pitching taken care of, we'll be OK," Richard said.  </P> <P> OUTLOOK: Verdugo Hills played well in a scrimmage against Van Nuys on Tuesday,  which made Richard feel a lot better about the big picture. "We've come a long,  long way," he said. "I'm really impressed with the work ethic. Everybody has a  great attitude." Richard has successfully cleared the first hurdle --  recruiting key young players from the student body. Whether the older players  can contribute in uncertain; last season, the junior varsity did not win a  game.  </P></p>

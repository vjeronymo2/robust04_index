			<p>BFN     [Text] Concerning the accusation brought by the military  command, the reaction of President Aristide's spokesman was not  long in coming. Let us listen to Jean-Claude Martineau.    [Begin Martineau recording, in Creole] They have spoken of a  certain meeting held in a Washington hotel. It was a public  meeting during which the president discussed how to get out of  the crisis with a great number of Haitians. Contrary to  statements by the men who pretend otherwise, I do not believe  any plans stemming from this meeting are being carried out.    First, I would like to say that these men have been killing  people for years. So, such a slight pretext will not relieve the  military -- who are slaughtering people left and right, then  laying their bodies in state [as heard] until pigs eat them in  the streets -- of their responsibilities. [words indistinct] as  if they are defending themselves against the wishes of an entire  nation and the entire world. This is something. It is drug  dealers' rhetoric. [end recording]    That was President Aristide's spokesman Jean-Claude  Martineau.</p>

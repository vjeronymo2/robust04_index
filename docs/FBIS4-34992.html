			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Noel Irias] </F>   [Text] Commander Bayardo Arce has reported that the  National Directorate of the Sandinist National Liberation Front  [FSLN] yesterday presented to the Sandinist People's Army [EPS]  its observations on the Military Code, especially on military  subordination to civilian authority and on the scope of military  responsibility.    A source said the two sides also discussed relations between  the Armed Forces and society -- relations "that the law does not  cover." Arce did not elaborate on these relations.    Arce explained: During the meeting "we expressed the  National Directorate's concern and reported its unanimous  opinion on the reforms the Military Code requires."    He reported that on Tuesday the Sandinist Directorate will  assess the arguments and explanations presented by the military  High Command in response to questions posed by the FSLN, adding  that in the afternoon the directorate will issue a communique to  make public its official position on the code.    The Sandinist leader said: "Our legislative wing is awaiting  this position to open debates on the code in the National  Assembly."    According to Arce, his party's position is not a product of  the opinion of the 15 members of the directorate. He affirmed  that the FSLN sought the opinion of various sectors of society,  including that of businessmen, retired EPS members, and the  party's rank and file. Arce described the meeting as "fruitful,  positive, and constructive."    Military spokesmen preferred not to comment on the working  session with the FSLN.    The National Directorate, which has been holding a special  session since last week, will continue the session Tuesday and  Wednesday of next week. On Thursday, it will hold a meeting  with the Board of Directors of the Higher Council of Private  Enterprise.</p>

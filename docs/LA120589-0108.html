Sentencing is scheduled for Feb. 13.  </P> <P> The former president of Far Western Bank in Tustin, Roger McGinnis, pleaded  guilty last month to one count of conspiracy in connection with the case, and  will be sentenced Jan. 18. A third man, John DeMattia, has also pleaded guilty.  </P> <P> Prosecutors said that in 1984 McGinnis provided casinos with false financial  information indicating that Goodman and DeMattia had large bank balances, thus  enabling the two men to obtain substantial credit lines.  </P> <P> The casinos allegedly defrauded in the scheme were Binion's Horseshoe, the Las  Vegas Hilton, the MGM Grand and the Desert Inn and Country Club.  </P></p>

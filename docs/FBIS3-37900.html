They say the process may take several months to implement  despite the resolution's demand for an immediate release of  Lefortovo prison inmates.    One source said the main problem was how to enforce the  resolution in a legal way. Nor is clear how the Duma's  constitutional prerogative of declaring amnesties will be  interpreted, he said. The source says that the amnesty covers  those convicted but not those under investigation or trial which  gives a wide room for legal interpretation of the Duma  resolution. Even if experts arrive at a conclusion that the  prisoners must be set free immediately, there is always a chance  of delaying the resolution indefinitely for various reasons such  as failure to return a book borrowed from the prison library, he  said.</p>

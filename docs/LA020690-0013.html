			<p><P> February 6, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ABORTION  </P> <P> In response to Conrad's continuing coat-hanger commentary on the Republican  Party (Jan. 28) and the Supreme Court (previous cartoons):  </P> <P> Let him also depict the other side -- the innocent, defenseless human being  within the uterus as the hands of the doctor (who has taken an oath to preserve  life) approach with instruments to scrape, salinize or vacuum the child out.  </P> <P> Sadly, in these times of self-seeking attitudes, the unborn are treated as  nonexistent or unimportant.  </P> <P> They are the product of conception and a woman's property and lacking civil  rights.  </P> <P> Pro-choice is a misnomer; the child has no choice. One day abortion will be  recognized for what it is -- sanitized, sanctioned murder -- and it will hang  heavy on the conscience of the nation.  </P> <P> DONNA EVICK  </P> <P> Culver City  </P></p>

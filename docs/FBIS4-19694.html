			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Saygi Ozturk: "Syria: Abdullah Ocalan Is in </F> Greece"--punctuation as published]    [Text] In view of Internal Affairs Minister Nahit Mentese's  visit to Damascus, Syria is preparing to deal a new blow to the  Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK]. Syrian Internal Affairs  Minister Muhammad Harbah has said: "We shall not allow the PKK  to exist in our country. We shall uproot that organization  together.    Harbah also said that PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan is not in  Syria and that they have been informed that he is in Greece.  According to the record on the talks Mentese and Harbah held,  the two officials exchanged the following views:    Mentese: Turkey and Syria have favorable relations. Turkey  wishes to maintain them.    Harbah: We wish to have our relations improved.  Furthermore, we wish to bring to light all matters that have  been in the dark until now. We must trust each other more.    Mentese: The Turkish officials are aware that the PKK's  terrorist activities in Turkey are organized in Syria. We have  reliable intelligence reports that confirm that state of  affairs. We ask you not to allow the PKK to shelter in your  country.    Harbah: We agree that the PKK was involved in various  activities in Syria until 1992. However, our relations entered  a new phase after then Internal Affairs Minister Ismet Sezgin  visited Damascus on 17 April 1992. We favor friendship and  fraternal relations between our two countries.    Mentese: That is exactly what Turkey wants. However, you  must prove your friendship and fraternal relations. Here is a  clipping from a newspaper. It says that PKK leader Abdullah  Ocalan met with three Turkish journalists in Barr Ilyas, which  is under Syria's control. That means that the PKK leader is in  this region.    Harbah: The reports that PKK leaders are in our region are  wrong. An effort is being made to create the impression that  the leading PKK cadres are either in Syria or in the region we  control in Lebanon in order to disrupt the relations between  Syria and Turkey.    Mentese: We will give you other documents that confirm that  Abdullah Ocalan is in this region. We will give you the  addresses of several places and telephone numbers. We know that  the leader of a terrorist organization cannot remain in the  region without your being informed of his presence. That Ocalan  is in the region is a strong possibility.    Harbah: We have received information that Ocalan is in  Greece. We will definitely not allow the PKK to organize  conferences or meet with journalists in Syria. We can guarantee  that.    Mentese: The PKK is a threat to Turkey and the region. A  part of Syria is included in the territory of the state the  Kurdish organizations wish to establish. You will suffer as  much as Turkey does.    Harbah: We are also worried about that. The establishment  of a Kurdish state in the region would be as harmful for you as  it would be for us. Syria's most fertile lands are included in  the territory of the state they wish to establish. We support  Turkey's territorial integrity. The political will in Syria  supports Turkey's territorial integrity. Ethnic communities are  a threat to Syria as much as they are to our neighbors. We will  remove the PKK's roots together.    Mentese: The Turkish public and the media are very sensitive  about the PKK problem. We have the right to expect our  neighbors to maintain a similar approach.    Harbah: We are not satisfied with the Turkish newspapers.  They publish reports against Syria. Do we not do anything  positive?    Mentese: Freedom of the press exists in Turkey. We cannot  interfere in their reports. That is out of the question. The  documents discovered in the possession of several terrorists  arrested in Silopi some time ago reveal that the PKK sent arms  and rocket launchers to Turkey through Syria. We will give  those documents to you.    Harbah: Not a single firearm can be transferred from one  place to another in Syria without the government being informed.  Nevertheless, what you have said will be investigated.    Nahit Mentese held talks with President al-Asad for three  hours on the last day of his visit. Mentese explained the  support the PKK and its leading members receive in Syria and  stressed that the effort to improve the cooperation between  Ankara and Damascus will be very useful for the two countries.</p>

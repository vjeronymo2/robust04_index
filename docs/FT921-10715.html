			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Upjohn shareholders to sue company officials over Halcion OFFICIALS at Upjohn, the Michigan-based pharmaceuticals company, are facing a shareholder lawsuit charging them with concealing information about problems with Halcion, the world's most widely prescribed sleeping pill, writes Karen Zagor in New York. The company, which recently denied a report that it had concealed data about the drug's side-effects from the Food and Drug Administration, said it believed the shareholder claims had no merit and the company would vigorously defend itself. Mr Theodore Cooper, Upjohn's chairman, and eight directors were named in the suit filed in a federal court in New York. Upjohn has faced a steady stream of criticism over Halcion since August, when a Salt Lake City woman sued the company claiming she had killed her mother in a fit of Halcion-induced violence. The case was settled out or court for an undisclosed amount. The latest suit charges the Upjohn officials with mismanagement, proxy fraud and 'self-dealing'. The suit accuses them of exposing Upjohn to liability from civil lawsuits, regulatory fines and penalties, possible criminal liability, and the loss of goodwill, reputation and standing. News of the suit had little impact on Upjohn's share price by midday in New York yesterday. Mr Sam Isaly, an analyst at Mehta and Isaly, which specialises in pharmaceutical stock, said: 'Usually the plaintiffs get some nuisance money but the potential damage is minimal.' Consumer activists in the US have pressed for the FDA to ban Halcion. In November the agency approved sales of the drug in smaller quantities, with inserts advising patients of side-effects. Upjohn has aggressively defended itself against critics and plans to bring a lawsuit against a Scottish psychiatrist who alleged the company failed to report adequately all of Halcion's side-effects. The UK banned sales of Halcion in October.</p>

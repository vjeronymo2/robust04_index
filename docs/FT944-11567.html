			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Sizeable turnround by coal 'cast-off' Sir, Whether Anglo United beats off the three other contenders, acquires Coal Products and thus secures its own 'salvation' ('The preferred route to recovery', November 3) remains to be seen. What is not in doubt is that Coal Products cannot be fairly described as 'British Coal's cast-off'. Our subsidiary has achieved a sizeable turnround in profitability over the past two years. This has been done by closing excess capacity and by developing the strengths of its branded products. Oxfam would be grateful for such valuable discards. Ray Proctor, finance director and director of privatisation, British Coal, Hobart House, Grosvenor Place, London SW1X 7AE</p>

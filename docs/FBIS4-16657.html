			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Letter from ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA editor N. Polezhayeva to </F> Moscow Prosecutor G.S. Ponomarev: "Witness' Testimony"]    [Text] I, Natalya Ivanovna Polezhayeva, chief editor of  ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA, have received a summons from the Moscow  prosecutor's office demanding that I appear before investigator  Leontyeva for questioning as a witness. I know very well I have  not witnessed any crime and so I naturally asked Mikhail  Ivanovich Slinko, chief of the department for the investigation  of banditry, in what connection and on what basis I was being  summoned.    It turned out it was in connection with the 12 April  publication in ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA of the article "Between the  Criminals and the Bureaucrats.... Who Needed Otari  Kvantrishvili's Death?" They wanted to find out from me the  name of the author and the source of the information.    I do not think that interrogation is needed for these  questions. An official request was enough, which had been  suggested. But M.I. Slinko, citing some article in the Criminal  Code, promised to draw up a compulsory court attendance order.    In order not to waste my own working time nor that of the  prosecutor's office workers, I have taken the liberty of  printing my testimony in the newspaper.    In accordance with article 41 of the Russian Federation law  "On the Mass Media," "the editorial office is obliged to keep  secret its source of information and does not have the right to  name a person supplying information on condition he is not  named, except for a case when relevant demand has come from a  court in connection with a case with which it is dealing."    In this case the author made anonymity a condition for the  purposes of his own safety. In this connection I cannot give  the author's name or the source of the information. But I  assure you it was obtained from officials of the Ministry of  Internal Affairs and the editorial office has no doubts about it.    [signed] Witness N. Polezhayeva</p>

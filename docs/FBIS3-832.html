			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report]  <H6>  THE CITIZEN </H6>   Bophuthatswana Events To Encourage ANC To Topple Buthelezi  --  Johannesburg THE CITIZEN in English on 11 March in its page-6  editorial maintains that "events in Bophuthatswana have put paid  to the involvement of any members of the Freedom Alliance in the  election other than Ciskei." The incidents in Bophuthatswana  will "cast a shadow over South Africa, encouraging ANC [African  National Congress] attempts to topple Chief Buthelezi and  increasing the chances of White Right resistance."    Warning Against `Bophuthatswana Treatment' for kwaZulu --  Johannesburg THE CITIZEN in English on 14 March in its page-6  editorial notes that the "Bophuthatswana crisis" has ended with  the takeover of the Bophuthatswana administration by the South  African Government and ANC-dominated Transitional Executive  Council and the appointment of Mr Tjaart van der Walt, until now  South African ambassador to Bophuthatswana, as administrator.  THE CITIZEN hopes kwaZulu "will not be given the Bophuthatswana  treatment and that Chief Buthelezi will allow the election to  take place, even without IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party]  participation, without offering any resistance. As for the  White Right, the AWB [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] has proved  a paper tiger and the Conservative Party [CP] is in danger of  splitting. With the CP in disarray, the Afrikaner Volksfront  [National Front] is weakened, and with the IFP isolated, so is  the Freedom Alliance."  <H6>  THE STAR </H6>   IFP Must Allow Others To Campaign Unhindered, Vote -- Having  decided against participating in South Africa's first nonracial  election in April, the IFP "must accept the responsibility of  ensuring that it does not hinder those who do wish to vote,"  declares a page-16 editorial in Johannesburg THE STAR in English  on 15 March. The IFP may deny that it intends to use  "undemocratic methods to discourage those wishing to cast  ballots" but "events on the ground look ominous. On Sunday at  least five people were killed in Umlazi, near Durban, after  armed IFP supporters occupied a stadium where the ANC was due to  hold a rally, forcing the meeting to be held elsewhere." "The  IFP leadership is facing a test -- and so is the Transitional  Executive Council, fresh from its admirably decisive performance  in Bophuthatswana."  <H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>   Divisions in IFP Over Election Participation -- Johannesburg  BUSINESS DAY in English on 15 March in a page-10 editorial sees  "divisions" in the IFP with the organization saying it will not  participate in the elections, and others, like central committee  member Ben Ngubane, saying "the election is still a definite  option." BUSINESS DAY believes there is "a slender chance of  participation despite the apparent firming of deadlines.  Barring this, Inkatha has only one card: the king." If the  IFP refuses to contest the polls, Mandela "can afford to tone  down the rhetoric and simply point to the fallacy of Buthelezi's  claims. But he has still to convince Zulus generally that the  future of the monarch and traditional chiefs is safe with an ANC  government, and that rank and file public servants need have no  fears of being dismissed or victimised." "If the ANC wins a  handsome share of the Natal vote, and finds the mediation  tiresome, it will be sorely tempted to dismiss Inkatha as  irrelevant, and pull out. Buthelezi will then be consigned to  the political wilderness, and there will be no coming back."    Call for Prosecution of Killers of AWB Members -- A second  editorial on the same page refers to the execution of two AWB  men in Bophuthatswana, saying the ANC's Popo Molefe "may be  unmoved by the killing members of a group of armed, racist  invaders, some whom had reportedly been shooting black  civilians. He may feel the AWB men got what they deserved, but  to move from there to the argument that nothing should be done  about cold-blooded murder is a slippery and dangerous path."  "Rights are universal and freedoms indivisible," and we cannot  "believe it is wrong to shoot Chris Hani but not Alwyn  Wolfaardt. The last thing the ANC should be encouraging is the  belief that only crimes of which it disapproves will be  prosecuted, or that some people can take the law into their own  hands."  <H6>  SOWETAN </H6>   Need To Woo Azapo Into Election Process -- "While we will be  watching with trepidation the Inkatha Freedom Party's  non-involvement in the election, we need to bite the bullet and  get on with it," states a page-8 editorial in Johannesburg  SOWETAN in English on 15 March. However, it makes SOWETAN  "uncomfortable" that "Azapo [Azanian People's Organization] has  been ignored despite the fact they are the only party to stick  to their guns. If the IFP is wooed back into the process every  attempt should be made to get Azapo back."</p>

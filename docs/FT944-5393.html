			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / How to Spend It: Take the silk road to oriental success - Avril Groom finds this season's Eastern styling full of promise The oriental exoticism which spices this year's Christmas dressing has fascinated Westerners for thousands of years. Alexander the Great's men brought richly-glinting textiles from Persia to Europe, and the Silk Road to China was already long-established when Marco Polo returned to Venice in 1295 with fabrics and fables from the court of Kublai Khan. Over the next 500 years, the West made full use of luscious embroideries and brocades from India and China, but the most far-flung destination of all, Japan, remained a closed book until the middle of last century. Then, a young draper's manager named Arthur Liberty became enthralled by the first display of Japanese artefacts in Britain  - at the International Exhibition of 1862 - and resolved to open an oriental shop. Japanese fabrics had already caught the imagination of the Pre-Raphaelite artists, and Liberty set out to supply them. So, by the time he opened his shop in 1875, its distinctive character - a heady mix of the Orient and the latest in contemporary design, then personified by the Arts and Crafts movement - had already and quite naturally come into being. Other exotic crazes followed, but over the past 100 years the yen for ethnic fashion has periodically led Western designers to turn eastwards for inspiration. Many designers have this season explored oriental themes. By inventive new cutting and experimenting with hi-tech fabrics respectively, Yohji Yamamoto and Issey Miyake constantly rework the kimonos and Haori coats which are their heritage. Jean-Paul Gaultier has switched his ethnic attentions to the padded silk and fur trims of Mongolia. But the special mix of delicate period detail and bold modernity belongs to one man - the British Designer of the Year, John Galliano, profiled on page 4 - whose tiny collection of 18 outfits has altered the image of evening-wear from designer stores to the High Street. Galliano's girl is at first sight a porcelain-fragile geisha, or a portrait of the bejewelled captive Chinese concubine, whose life-story forms the extraordinary early chapters of Jung Chang's Wild Swans. Yet other elements  -high-heeled shoes and seamed stockings, a tailored jacket or a body-caressing bias-cut skirt - make her firmly a creature of the 1990s. This clever mix of ancient oriental and modern European strikes a chord with today's woman, who reserves her right to be, and look, both strong and vulnerable. To mix successfully Eastern mystery with up-front modernity, soft-pedal the oriental. Rather than look like a stray from the chorus of Madam Butterfly you want to suggest a mood through detail. Galliano does it to perfection - a black satin jacket has straight, upturned, kimono-style lapels and trumpet-shaped, contrast-lined sleeves, yet it is still traditionally tailored and double-breasted. His precision-cut designs (available at Liberty, Brown's and Joseph) are highly priced, but even the beautiful embroidered silk obis (sashes) that go with them would, at Pounds 140, be enough to capture the spirit if worn with a plain black, fluted or bias-cut dress. Oriental colour schemes, so often based on red or gold, add seasonal brightness with an unusual slant to the eternal sea of evening black. Plain velvet trousers leap to life when teamed with an frog-fastened silk jacket from Monsoon that has a subtle, fitted, rather than boxy Chinese, cut. A long skirt, based by Yohji Yamamoto on traditional Japanese fabric wraps and richly printed on fiery red, its texture derived from old kimono silk, needs nothing more than a matt-black T-shirt to balance its drama. Issey Miyake inimitably modernises ancient shapes: his sunset-orange jacket has a hint of the kimono in its print and slanted edges, while its pleats mould flatteringly to the body in contemporary style. It looks topically hard-edged with lacquer-shiny PVC jeans (Top Shop's at Pounds 29.99, are a good version of this one-season buy). Whistles gets in the mood with a chinoiserie print on satin but it makes it up in voguishly nostalgic, and very European, bias-cut shapes. Liberty is still the happy hunting ground of orientalists. The store has a tradition of buying oriental jewellery and accessories. This time it is the influence, rather than the letter, of oriental style that is appropriate, such as the little tassled brocade bag illustrated. Fenwick is also a good source of period-style glass-bead jewellery, carefully made and reasonably priced, from Erickson Beamon and Robert Rose. Long strings of jet-look beads start from Pounds 24.95. Evening scarves include a fringed black-velvet style, lined in red satin and embroidered in gold (Mondi, Pounds 95) while crocheted, beaded drawstring bags are Pounds 21.95. Natasha Barrault's fragile, beaded organza bags (from Pounds 200, at Browns), Colette Maluf's tiny diamante-spangled hairpins and slides (from Pounds 22 at Space NK, WC2), Wonderful Wraps' tassled and padded, velvet and satin stoles, and Herbert Johnson's nostalgic half-hats and headbands all have just the right mood of delicately louche Eastern promise. Special pieces, such as Yamamoto's sarong or Galliano's obi, have the making of modern heirlooms. But if you have time and energy, searching for antique originals is rewarding. The Gallery of Antique Costumes and Textiles, Church Street, London NW8, Cornucupia, Tachbrook Street, SW1 and antique markets often have a little vintage chinoiserie. Even jumble sales can come up trumps. Years ago at one I unearthed a large fringed scarf in black Chinese silk, traditionally embroidered in white. It has elicited more comment than any of the little black designer dresses it has been worn with.</p>

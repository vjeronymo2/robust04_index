			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Laing fall restricted to 11% and dividend maintained JOHN LAING yesterday brought a brief moment of cheer in a chill week for construction companies which has seen three of its larger rivals announce dividend cuts, writes Andrew Taylor. Laing managed to restrict its pre-tax profits fall to just 11 per cent to Pounds 5.6m (Pounds 6.3m) and maintained its interim dividend at 3p. This was covered by earnings per share of 4.5p (4.8p). At the end of June the company had net cash of Pounds 10m, compared with borrowings of Pounds 13.2m at the same stage last year. The share price rose 11p to 120p. In the first half there was a small loss on housing in the UK and US. Both markets remained very difficult said Mr Martin Laing, chairman. He criticised the government's failure to stimulate the economy, while the jobless total was mounting and construction companies were going into receivership. COMMENT Laing's reputation as a quality contractor is not misplaced. The company has displayed an admirable ability to generate cash. It has been helped by some big contracts won in the late 1980s, when margins were higher, and which have still to be completed. The current order book is about 25 per cent lower than in June last year, which may not be a bad thing. It may indicate that the group is choosy about what work it takes on. Laing, like others, continues to struggle with housing. It says further provisions are not required at this stage, but much will depend upon whether house prices have finally reached bottom. The company, however, plans to take about Pounds 20m a year out of housing over the next three years. In the current year it may make Pounds 18m, which would put it on a prospective p/e of just over 8. One of the few companies in the sector which might just justify a buy recommendation.</p>

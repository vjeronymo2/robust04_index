			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Arts: Young composers - Barbican Hall The BBC's 'Young Musician of the Year' competition has been running for a long time now, but this year Lloyds Bank has been inspired to extend its sponsorship to a 'Young Composer Award' as well. Splendid idea; but not, this first time, ideally well handled by the BBC, for the three-and-a-half hours it took. On Monday we heard pieces by the 12 composer-finalists, interspersed with mostly dim performances of irrelevant music by former Young Musicians of their Years, and with laborious relocations of music-stands and microphones, chummy commentary by a female compere and much intrusive noise from the BBC crew - rumbling mobile cameras, audible instructions from their earphones, bangs and crashes from the booths at the back of the stalls. Much more serious, for a competition that wears a public face, was that we never knew when we were hearing the vital evidence. Each contestant among the original 69 (their ages ranged from 15 to 21, and all the finalists were male) had submitted a 'portfolio' of four pieces, as varied as possible - with express encouragement to venture into popular territory, though nothing we heard suggested any such ambition. For performance in this concert, however, only works playable by the faithful Nash Ensemble or by soloists could be exhibited; and yet we were told repeatedly that the jury would take equal account of the unheard pieces too. Quite right: but where does that leave the live audience? It was made clear that two or more of the composers had dressed up earlier 'exercises' as small-ensemble pieces. Presumably they took bolder flights in their full-orchestra stuff, or perhaps in soloistic flights that would require rehearsal-time beyond the budget - but we were not to know that. The eventual joint winners were the 18-year-old James Webb, a Charterhouse chorister whose processional carol 'Huic Magi' testified to a sensuous modern ear for twining chapel voices, and Philip Howard (15) with a slight but elegantly shaped flute-and-piano piece, and a colouristic, under-propelled study called The Rains. We were not to know how much of Halli Cauthery's range was contained in his three icy, unappetising songs on homicidal Icelandic poems (delivered by Peter Hall with faultless commitment), nor whether Craig Grosvenor's coolly serial guitar-piece Noir or Elliott Tucker's bright but disjointed Aladinsane - title after David Bowie - represented their best work. Richard Whalley's Phoenix, striving innocently to match an empurpled DH Lawrence exhortation, might or might not have been his best effort. At the very least, the candidates next time should be told firmly that a Nash-sized piece will have to be their public exhibit if they make the finals - with a bigger piece on tap for a later BBC concert, should they win. The Leeds piano competition is not a good comparison: there too the semi-finals (and more) are taken into account, but aficionados can hear them, whereas the essential workings of this 'Young Composer' contest were reserved to the private ears and eyes of the jury. There must be better ways of arranging it.</p>

			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / International Company News: Upbeat outlook for US biotechs The US biotechnology industry continues to confound the pessimists and flourish, in spite of the difficult economic and political climate, according to the largest annual survey of biotech companies. The Ernst &amp; Young report shows the combined revenues of 1,311 companies up 12 per cent to Dollars 11.2bn for the year to June 30 1994. Research and development expenses rose by 23 per cent to Dollars 7bn, leading to a total net loss for the industry of Dollars 4.1bn, compared with Dollars 3.6bn for the previous year. 'Biotech is marching on, although lots of people are trying to write its obituary,' said Mr Kenneth Lee, Ernst &amp; Young life sciences director. 'Even healthcare reform, which many believed could lead to the demise of many biotech companies, will actually provide a boost to the industry as the new marketplace embraces and reimburses innovative therapies.' Best evidence for the industry's health is the growing number of products undergoing clinical trials - up from 270 a year ago to more than 300. The report shows that the two most successful companies, Amgen and Genentech, are far ahead of the rest. The Californian pair developed eight of the 10 best-selling biotech drugs, and their combined market valuation of Dollars 11.4bn accounts for more than a quarter of the whole industry's capitalisation. Ernst &amp; Young's main concern is whether biotech companies will be able to raise enough new money from investors to fund current levels of R&amp;D. The average company has enough cash in hand to remain in operation for the next 25 months at its current 'burn rate'; the comparable figure a year ago was 34 months. Although venture capitalists invested Dollars 639m in biotech in 1993-94 (compared with Dollars 459m in the previous year) their money is moving from early-stage companies to later-stage investments.

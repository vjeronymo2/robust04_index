			<p><P> July 29, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ON THE WATERFRONT: ALLURE OF THE SPORT;  </P> <P> FISHING CLUB STRESSES CONSERVATION, THE FUN OF ANGLING  </P> <P> Tucked away beside the fuel dock near the Balboa Pavilion is a one-room  cottage, so small and unpretentious that most folks never give it a second  glance. Yet, it is home to one of the largest fishing clubs in the world.  </P> <P> The Balboa Angling Club was founded in 1926 by about 75 avid fishermen. During  the 63 years of its existence, the club has grown to include 1,000 members,  ranging from kids to senior citizens. And it has earned an international  reputation, thanks in large part to the dozens of world records in salt-water  game fishing held by members like Gil Kraemer, whose picture hangs in a  prominent spot on the back wall of the clubhouse.  </P> <P> Kraemer, last year's president, caught a whopping 1,062-pound blue marlin in  the waters off Hawaii and now holds the world record for the largest billfish.  The club has come to expect this kind of big-league fishing from its members.  Yet, as Helen Smith is quick to point out, there is a lot more to the Balboa  Angling Club than bringing home a big fish.  </P> <P> Smith, club secretary and official fish weigher for the past 29 years, likes to  remind visitors that the club was originally founded to promote conservation.  Members release most of the marlin they catch, she says. "We were one of the  forerunners in tagging and releasing."  </P> <P> The club holds one of the largest released marlin tournaments in Southern  California -- the Master Billfish Tournament, which this year takes place Sept.  6 through 10. The tournament usually draws about 75 boats, ranging in size from  18-foot Boston Whalers to 95-foot fishing yachts. The range in boat sizes  reflects the economic mix of the club membership, Smith says.  </P> <P> "We're not like a yacht club. We have a lot of people who are not rich in this  club. The little guy can compete along with the guy with a lot of money. And  we've got lots of rich people in the club, too."  </P> <P> To join the club, anglers must pay a one-time entry fee of $50 and a yearly fee  of $80 for singles, $115 for families and $15 for juniors. Lifetime memberships  cost $1,000. Prospective members must be recommended by a current member.  </P> <P> The clubhouse, managed by Helen Smith, the organization's only paid staff  member, is open Thursday through Sunday. Smith, whose husband formerly operated  a commercial sportfishing boat, says she got the job nearly 30 years ago  because she "knew fishing, knew office work and knew how to talk on the  (marine) radio."  </P> <P> At work in her small, waterfront office, with its commanding view of Newport  Harbor, Smith fields phone calls from members wanting the latest fish reports.  "Don't forget to look under the kelp patties for yellowtail," she told a recent  caller. She also prepares -- and frequently updates -- a recorded fish report  that is available 24 hours a day by dialing (714) 673-3520.  </P> <P> One of her most important duties is weighing in the day's catches. "I'll even  take their picture," she says. "Many years ago, I used to have to come down at  1 or 2 in the morning and weigh in the fish, but my husband won't let me come  down after 9 anymore."  </P> <P> Before the permanent clubhouse was built in 1947, club members weighed their  fish at a dock between the Pavilion and the ferry crossing. But in 1947, 41  members bought $100 certificates to finance construction of the current  clubhouse, pier and an official weigh station that serves all Newport Harbor,  including non-club members. The biggest fish Smith remembers weighing was a  600-pound broadbill swordfish.  </P> <P> Every summer the club runs a junior angling tournament that is open to the  public. The 37th annual tournament, which began June 17, will continue through  Aug. 20 and is open to boys and girls under 16. Contest rules are available at  the Balboa Angling Club or at most local fish weigh-in stations. (For  information dial (714) 673-6316.)  </P> <P> Smith says the tournament is designed to "get the kids out fishing" for the  summer. One "kid" named Jock Albright began fishing with the club 25 years ago  and is still going strong.  </P> <P> "I was 9 when I joined the club," says Albright, who now serves as club  treasurer. For Albright, the appeal of fishing is in the sport itself -- not  the catch.  </P> <P> "I like spending time on the ocean," he says. "It seems like every day you're  out there you see something different. Different sea life, porpoises, whales.  Every fishing day is different."  </P> <P> Floating Lab -- The Orange County Marine Institute will offer two excursions,  both open to the public, aboard its special research-oriented floating lab this  weekend.  </P> <P> The first will be offered from 5:30 to 8:30 p.m. today, and the second will  take place from 9 a.m. to noon Sunday.  </P> <P> The family-oriented program is offered aboard the 85-foot research vessel Van  Tuna. Participants, who will spend three hours at sea collecting various  marine-life specimens, should arrive at least 15 minutes before departure. Cost  is $20 per adult, $10 per child. For information, dial (714) 831-3850 or (714)  496-2274.  </P> <P> Junior Championships -- The prestigious Governor's Cup junior match races for  teen-age sailors will take place Thursday through Aug. 6, at the Balboa Yacht  Club, 1801 Bayside Drive, Corona del Mar.  </P> <P> Thirty-six top sailors from across the United States and as far away as New  Zealand will compete in the racing event, which is one of a half-dozen major  junior championships in the United States.  </P> <P> The sailors, divided into 12 teams of three, will race in identically rigged  Santana 20 sailboats. Races will begin at noon each day in the ocean just off  the Newport Pier. Three races are planned each day on Thursday, Friday and  Saturday. The final two races are scheduled Sunday. For information, dial (714)  673-3515.  </P> <P> Cruising South -- For those who have always dreamed of sailing off into the  sunset, Orange Coast College is offering a two-night sailing seminar on  cruising Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean by private boat.  </P> <P> The program is entitled "Cruising South" and is from 7 to 10 p.m. Wednesday and  Aug. 9 at the Orange Coast College Sailing Center, 1801 W. Coast Highway,  Newport Beach.  </P> <P> Experienced cruisers John Bowman, Don and Jill Shannon and Bill McNaughton will  be guest speakers. Cost is $39. For information, dial (714) 432-5880.  </P> <P> Kids in Boats -- A beginning boating course for children is being offered this  summer by the Orange County Girl Scouts at the Dana Point Harbor Youth and  Group Facility, 34451 Ensenada Place, Dana Point.  </P> <P> Called "Round Robin Boating," the class is open to children 10 and older and  covers rowing, canoeing, sailing and basic boating safety. Participants must be  able to swim. Classes will be from 1 to 4 p.m. Monday through Friday. Cost is  $35 for Girl Scouts, $40 for others. For information, dial (714) 979-7900.  </P></p>

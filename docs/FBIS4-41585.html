			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Omer Kebapcioglu report from Baku] </F>   [Text] Vladimir Kazimirov, President Yeltsin's special  envoy to Nagorno-Karabakh, who is conducting shuttle diplomacy  to solve the Azerbaijani-Armenian conflict, arrived in Baku  again last night. He was received by President Geydar Aliyev  this morning. Kazimirov said Russia believes the active  participation of Turkey and Iran in the efforts to resolve the  Nagorno-Karabakh problem would be beneficial. He explained that  he went to Tehran to hold talks with this aim and that Iran  agreed to the proposal in principle. Kazimirov said he will soon  go to Ankara with the same proposal.    Aliyev said he finds the proposal favorable. He said he  supports the current developments, which started with a  cease-fire and continued with a letter sent to the leaders of  the sides concerned. The active participation of Turkey and  Iran, Aliyev said, might make a solution easier.    Aliyev pointed out that Turkey is a member both of the CSCE  and of the Minsk Group. In this respect, he said, we attach  great importance to the participation of Turkey in particular.</p>

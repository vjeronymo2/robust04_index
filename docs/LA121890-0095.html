			<p><P> December 18, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIRM'S TELEPHONE SWEEPSTAKES OFFERS SOVIET ROCKET RIDE  </P> <P> A company is betting Americans so dearly want to fly in space that they will  pay to enter a sweepstakes for a chance to win a trip aboard a Soviet rocket  and a week on the space station Mir.  </P> <P> "Our long-term business strategy is to arrange for space travel opportunities  for anyone who wishes to go into space," James Davidson of Space Travel  Services said Monday.  </P> <P> Would-be American cosmonauts can call 1-900-258-2MIR -- at a cost of $2.99 per  call -- to enter a random drawing. Space Travel gets more than half of that  revenue.  </P> <P> Soviet officials could not be reached Monday to confirm the announcement.  </P> <P> But Americans reacted immediately to the contest offer. Thousands of calls to  the number Monday overloaded the service company's circuits and made the line  inaccessible, the company said.  </P> <P> The company said the problem should be corrected by today.  </P> <P> The winner, to be selected in December, 1991, gets six months of training,  including Russian language lessons, and a seat on a Soviet rocket in late 1992  or early 1993, plus $500,000 cash.  </P></p>

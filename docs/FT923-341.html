			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / The Labour Party at Blackpool: Maastricht rebels fail to dent leadership's resolve A GRASSROOTS rebellion in favour of a national referendum on the Maastricht treaty was halted in its tracks yesterday when Mr Gerald Kaufman was joined by senior trade union leaders to argue against a plebiscite. The outcome was an overwhelming vote against two motions - one which opposed ratification of the treaty, the other which pressed for a referendum. Senior party officials pointed out that the defeat for the opponents of Maastricht was not merely due to the union barons, but also sprang from overwhelming support for the leadership from constituency parties. They pointed out also that the show-of-hands vote so clearly backed the platform that the rebels waived their right to demand a card vote which would have shown the exact scale of their defeat. As a result, Mr John Smith, the party leader, can expect to see his hand substantially strengthened when he presents his tactics to the members of his parliamentary party, many of whom are clearly more critical than the conference of his stance. In his speech, Mr Kaufman, who stepped down this summer as shadow foreign secretary, warned that a referendum would help the Conservatives out of their difficulties on Europe and threatened to split Labour. He urged the party to campaign for greater powers for the European Parliament, greater EC aid for the regions and use of the EC as a 'force to redress Tory domestic policy'. He said the Community was far from perfect but Labour had much to gain from 'getting the best possible out of the EC'. The centrepiece of the government's Europe policy had become a vacuum, he said. 'Maastricht is the Tories' problem,' Mr Kaufman said. 'We should not turn it into Labour's problem.' A referendum would 'create unnecessary divisions in the Labour party, in every union, in every branch, in every constituency Labour party, in the parliamentary Labour party,' he said. Similar views were advanced by Mr Gavin Laird, the engineers' and electricians' leader, and Mr Alan Tuffin of the communications workers. For the rebels, Mr Tony Benn, the former cabinet minister and veteran leftwing MP for Chesterfield, argued forcefully that it was wrong that Labour should oppose a democratic vote on the Maastricht treaty when the French and Danes had held referendums. He added: 'We pride ourselves on one member, one vote to elect the leader (of the party) but not one member, one vote to decide the future of this country.' But in spite of a warm reception, the conference voted overwhelmingly against him.</p>

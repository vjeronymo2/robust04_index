			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Survey of Guernsey (26): Chancellor mans the petrol pumps - His committee is the primary forum for discussing tax and spending issues / Profile:  Conseiller Roydon Falla ANYONE in Guernsey who objects to paying 20 per cent income tax should have no problem tracking down the chancellor of the exchequer to make their views known - especially if they drive a car. Conseiller Roydon Falla, the man who has presented the island's budget for the past decade, is to be found on alternate Saturday afternoons operating the pumps at his petrol station. 'It keeps me in touch with my customers,' he says. 'And parishioners still think of me as one of their representatives.' Falla, a tenacious 71-year-old, has a twinkle in his eye and his feet firmly rooted on the island on which he was born. He recently returned from a trip to London to receive an OBE in the New Year Honours Lists - the three letters have already been added to his business cards. But he has never seriously considered moving away from Guernsey. The title chancellor is misleading, although one he is frequently given since he posed for journalists clutching a donated suitcase in the style of the British chancellor of the exchequer's red budget box. In fact, Mr Falla's formal title is president of the advisory and finance committee. Guernsey's government runs by majority vote, not by a cabinet issuing diktats. He certainly does not have the final say in the annual patterns of revenue-raising and expenditure. But his role is of vital importance. The committee is the primary forum for discussing tax and spending issues. It also scrutinises every policy letter issued by the island's other committees, and it can attach a comment disagreeing with the recommendations if it chooses. While he may leave the minutiae of technical issues to others, Mr Falla is regarded as an effective chairman able to steer discussion, listen to arguments and steer decision-making. Next year he plans to retire from politics to focus on his hobbies: snooker and gardening. It will make a change from the battles he has fought, including a vote of no confidence in his committee and the presentation of an alternative budget by a rival. 'I have lost customers because of decisions I have taken,' he says. 'I approved the closing of the school where my children were educated. But I believed it was right. My first priority must be the island.' Mr Falla has been involved in local politics for many years. His uncle had been a deputy before the war, and his wife's father was a deputy. He sat on the police committee, the local school committee and the parish council. He was prepared for a fight when he stood for election as the deputy for Torteval district in 1970, but the incumbent decided to stand down and he was elected without opposition for two three-year terms. Then in 1976, he was selected by the electoral college as one of the island's 12 conseillers. He pauses for a long time when asked why he has survived in politics. 'I think people trust my judgment,' he says cautiously. 'I have always kept a low profile, but I think I can cut through the cackle.' He served as president of the housing authority and the police committee, and vice-president of the civil service board. In the meantime, he was running his businesses - a plumbing and electrical contracting company, and a garage. He admits to a tension in the future of the island's economy. 'We must protect and look after the finance sector and make sure it stays,' he says. But he winces at the mention of the phrase 'offshore centre. 'The feeling I get is that we are respected as a financial centre,' he says. 'We never went out to become one. But it's a highly competitive market now and we have to go out and get business.' He also recognises the difficulties raised by the lack of diversity, which has been driven by the decline of horticulture as much as the growth in finance. He wants to see the expansion of what he calls the 'visitor economy', and also stresses the development of trade links with France. But he wants to see only growth which does not put pressure on the island's limited space or workforce. Mr Falla sees no need to change Guernsey's relationship with the EC. And he does not anticipate any change to the long-standing policy of maintaining a balanced budget. 'It's really good house-keeping,' he says. 'If we can't afford something, we don't do it.' But says he would like to reduce the island's reliance on income tax, and he supports moves to consider the introduction of some form of value-added tax, if the difficulties of inflation and collection can be overcome. If progress is made on that issue in the next few months, his political battles are certainly not yet over.</p>

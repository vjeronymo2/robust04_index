			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Airport to expand as protestors relent The Japanese government is expected to announce plans next week to increase capacity at Tokyo's overcrowded Narita international airport, following a deal with anti-airport pressure groups who have blocked expansion for almost 30 years. Mr Shizuka Kamei, the transport minister, said his ministry had accepted a proposal from mediators that would settle its dispute with farmers and other groups hostile to the airport. He declined to comment on the details of the plan but it is understood to provide for the construction of one additional runway at the airport, 40 miles north-east of Tokyo. Farmers and environmentalists successfully held up the original construction of the airport for more than a decade and have vehemently opposed any expansion, but they are understood to have agreed to the mediators' proposal. It calls upon the government to suspend plans for a third runway and not to press ahead with the construction of the second before completing extensive consultations with farmers and residents affected. The transport ministry had originally proposed the construction of two more runways at the site to meet the rapidly growing demand for landing slots. An estimated 38m passengers are expected to use the airport in 2006, compared with 22m now. Airlines from 43 countries are awaiting permission for landing rights at Narita. The compromise is expected to be formally approved at a final round of negotiations next Tuesday. However, the consultation process is expected to take several years to complete before construction of the runway can begin.</p>

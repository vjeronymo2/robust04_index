			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: CULVER CITY;  </P> <P> SEWER CHARGE CHANGES OKD  </P> <P> The City Council has unanimously approved changing sewer charges for  single-family residences from a flat fee to one that is linked to water  consumption during the 1990-91 fiscal year.  </P> <P> The old flat-rate fee system was adopted in 1978, but a recent study by the  consulting firm Psomas &amp; Associates concluded that it is feasible to start  charging sewage fees based on readings from water meters, according to a staff  report.  </P> <P> The new fee system, however, cannot be applied to apartment and condominiums  that are served by a single water meter.  </P> <P> Under the new system, owners who want to avoid sewer charges on water used to  irrigate lawns and gardens could install a separate meter for outdoor water  use. A city staff report advised owners who use more than 35,000 cubic feet of  water a year for irrigation to install an additional meter.  </P></p>

			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Pressure on margins drives Acorn down to Pounds 115,000 Higher component costs and increased competition drove margins down at Acorn Computer Group, contributing to a sharp fall in annual profits. Although revenues in the 12 months to December 31 rose 13 per cent to Pounds 54.3m (Pounds 48.2m), operating profits fell from Pounds 1.58m to Pounds 104,000 and the pre-tax line was Pounds 115,000, against Pounds 1.31m. Earnings per share fell to 0.2p (2p). The shares dropped 14p to 76p. The company, controlled by Olivetti of Italy, remains the principal supplier of computers to schools in the UK. Gross profit margins fell by 5 per cent as the cost of key components, especially semiconductors, rose. Profits were further hit by the Pounds 700,000 cost of establishing a new operation in Germany. Mr Ernesto Musumeci, chairman, said Germany was an important potential market and that the investment had been important for the company's longer-term development. Revenues from the new operation had, however, been affected badly by the recession. He thought it unlikely that margins would recover because of competitive pressures and was taking steps to reduce overheads accordingly. The company benefited from a Pounds 183,000 contribution to profits from Advanced Risc Machines, a semiconductor company in which Acorn has a 42.86 per cent stake. ARM develops products that are being used, among others, by Apple Computer of the US and Samsung Electronics of Korea. Mr Musumeci said the company would continue to address the home computer user as well as the schools market. It has launched a range of machines - Risc PC - able to run both Acorn operating software and operating systems from other suppliers and suited to publishing and interactive multimedia.</p>

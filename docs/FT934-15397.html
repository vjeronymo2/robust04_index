			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: UK economy On the surface, a 3 per cent underlying growth in output prices in the year to September must come as bad news for those who believe UK inflation is licked. The rate. which excludes food, drink, tobacco and petroleum, is creeping up from levels much closer to 2 per cent six months ago. But there is some consolation in the reason for the acceleration of the annual rate. The abnormally low rises of last summer and autumn are starting to drop out of the index. On a monthly basis there is hardly any acceleration at all: the rate has fluctuated around 0.3 per cent for some time. On top of that input prices are falling again, while weak food price inflation is holding down the overall headline rate. The good news is thus that these figures do not show inflation about to take off again. It seems unlikely that the authorities will face a test of their determination to keep underlying retail price inflation below 4 per cent. The bad news is that the fall in inflation should apparently have come to a halt at such a high level despite the severity of the recession. Adjusted for mortgages, retail prices are growing at around 3 per cent, well inside the upper half of the official target range. The Bank of England may not yield unprotesting to demands for lower rates around Budget time unless it also sees firm evidence of fiscal responsibility.</p>

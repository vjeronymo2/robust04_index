			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Watchdog urges publishers not to run latest Benetton adverts THE Advertising Standards Authority yesterday urged British publishers and poster contractors to refuse all but one of a new series of controversial advertisements for Benetton, the Italian clothes manufacturer and retailer. One of the advertisements, which has already received wide publicity, is a photograph of a dying Aids patient, Mr David Kirby. The others show a burning car, Albanian refugees leaping from a ship, an Asian couple struggling in flood waters, an African guerrilla soldier holding a human thigh bone and a child being lifted by its arm on to a truck in the midst of an African crowd. The ASA said it had advised publishers that only the photograph of the Asian couple is likely to avoid falling foul of its code of conduct. Ms Caroline Crawford of the ASA said the majority were 'pure exploitation of scenes of tragedy and would be highly likely to cause great distress'. In London yesterday, Mr Luciano Benetton, one of the company's founders, and Mr Oliviero Toscani, responsible for the creative aspects of the campaign, vigorously denied suggestions that the campaign exploited human suffering to sell clothing. Since 1984 Benetton has regularly been censured in many countries for using shocking photographic images in its advertising. Mr Benetton said his company, which has 6,500 retail outlets in some 100 countries, will this year spend 4 per cent of its annual Pounds 1.96bn turnover on the latest campaign and other planned media projects. Mr Toscani said Mr Kirby's parents had consented to the use of the photograph of their dying son in the campaign, and that 'it was a privileged way to die, in the arms of his family.' He said Benetton's advertising policy was 'to move from using advertising to promote a product, to the promotion of greater social awareness.' He added that such advertising 'probably doesn't sell sweaters but I don't care'. Asked whether the company had considered making charitable donations to help solve some of the social problems featured in the campaign photographs, Mr Benetton said: 'As far as making charitable contributions is concerned, that isn't our job. The state must be present in those circumstances.' Mr Toscani condemned conventional advertising as merely 'showing everything that is fake . . . I think Benetton is doing something more useful than just selling a product, though of course you have to do that too.' He added that Benetton was very pleased with the mass of free publicity its controversial advertising had attracted. Mr Benetton also said that the company planned to move into other forms of media, including magazine publishing and the production of 'educational films'. Observer, Page 20</p>

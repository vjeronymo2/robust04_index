			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / International Company News: Brussels solves gas sale problem The Belgian government has chosen a Belgian solution to the difficult privatisation of SNI-NIM, the state holding company which owns 50 per cent of Distrigaz, the country's gas supply and distribution monopoly. The government has agreed in principle to sell most of its 83 per cent stake in SNI-NIM to Ackermans &amp; van Haaren, a quoted Antwerp-based industrial holding company. If Ackermans agrees to the government's conditions, the deal should raise about BFr14.5bn (Dollars 397m) to help ease Belgium's budget deficit. The decision - part of the government's BFr85bn four-year privatisation programme - puts an end to rival bids for a stake in Distrigaz, lodged by a range of international investors, including British Gas. The government wants to keep tight control over Distrigaz, through a 'golden share,' and is also insisting that an unspecified stake in the company - probably between 10 and 25 per cent - is floated on the Brussels stock exchange. The government will retain ownership of certain other SNI-NIM holdings, including its 6.6 per cent stake in Sabena, the national airline. British Gas, VIAG and Bayernwerk of Germany, and Conoco, the oil and gas subsidiary of DuPont of the US, had made a rival offer for Distrigaz, and BASF, the German chemicals group, had expressed a separate interest in Distrigaz shares. Instead, the 50 per cent stake will be sold initially by Ackermans to Tractebel, the quoted Belgian utilities group which owns a further 33 per cent of the gas company. Apart from the stock market flotation, Tractebel has also promised to cede small stakes in Distrigaz to regional energy companies in Belgium. The remaining 17 per cent of Distrigaz is owned by Shell. The government said it hoped to conclude a deal with Ackermans by the end of the month, and then seek European Commission approval for the sale. Apart from its energy holdings, SNI-NIM's main investments are in financial companies, transport and engineering groups. Politically and financially, the disposal of SNI-NIM is the most complex of the planned privatisations. Last year, the government agreed to sell half of CGER-ASLK, the state-owned network of bank and insurance branches, to Fortis, the Dutch-Belgian financial services group, for BFr35bn.</p>

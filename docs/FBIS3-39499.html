At the same time the high  unemployment rate remains the key economic problem, according to  the ministry's economic report for February, published in Bonn  today.    The rebuilding of the east German economy is continuing to  make "clear progress," the report says. The private sector in  eastern Germany is "increasingly gaining momentum." [passage  omitted]    The rise in the level of registered unemployed to over 4  million was "not surprising" and in line with the annual  forecast. It was due largely to the usual effects of winter on  the labor market, which would subside during the spring, the  report predicts optimistically. In addition, the labor market  is seen as a delayed indicator which "still shows the effects of  last spring's economic setback in eastern Germany." [passage  omitted]</p>

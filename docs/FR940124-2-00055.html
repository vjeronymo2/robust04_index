			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 5. The Trustees of the Funds will receive quarterly and annual statements concerning distribution and shareholder servicing expenditures complying with paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of rule 12b&hyph;1, as it may be amended from time to time. In the statements, only expenditures properly attributable to the sale or servicing of a particular class of shares will be used to justify any distribution or servicing fee charged to that class. Expenditures not related to the sale or servicing of a particular class will not be presented to the Trustees to justify any fee attributable to that class. The statements, including the allocations upon which they are based, will be subject to the review and approval of the Independent Trustees in the exercise of their fiduciary duties. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Dividends paid by a Fund with respect to each class of shares, to the extent any dividends are paid, will be calculated in the same manner, at the same time, on the same day and will be in the same amount, except that fee payments made under rule 12b&hyph;1 plans relating to each respective class of shares will be borne exclusively by that class and any incremental transfer agency costs relating a particular class of shares will be borne exclusively by such class. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. The methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset value and dividends and distributions of the classes and the proper allocation of income and expenses between the classes has been reviewed by an expert (the ``Independent Examiner'') who has rendered a report to applicants, which has been provided to the staff of the SEC, stating that such methodology and procedures are adequate to ensure that such calculations and allocations will be made in an appropriate manner. On an ongoing basis, the Independent Examiner, or an appropriate substitute Independent Examiner, will monitor the manner in which the calculations and allocations are being made and, based upon such review, will render at least annually a report to the Funds that the calculations and allocations are being made properly. The reports of the Independent Examiner shall be filed as part of the periodic reports filed with the SEC pursuant to sections 30(a) and 30(b)(1) of the Act. The work papers of the Independent Examiner with respect to such reports, following request by the Funds which the Funds agree to make, will be available for inspection by the SEC staff upon the written request for such work papers by a senior member of the Division of Investment Management or of a Regional Office of the Commission, limited to the Director, an Associate Director, the Chief Accountant, the Chief Financial Analyst, an Assistant Director, and any Regional Administrators or Associate and Assistant Administrators. The initial report of the Independent Examiner is a ``report on policies and procedures placed in operation'' and the ongoing reports will be ``reports on policies and procedures placed in operation and tests of operating effectiveness'' as defined and described in SAS No. 70 of the AICPA, as it may be amended from time to time, or in similar auditing standards as may be adopted by the AICPA from time to time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. The applicants have adequate facilities in place to ensure implementation of the methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset value and dividends and distributions of the classes of shares and the proper allocation of expenses between such classes of shares, and this representation has been concurred with by the Independent Examiner in the initial report referred to in condition 7 above and will be concurred with by the Independent Examiner, or an appropriate substitute Independent Examiner, on an ongoing basis at least annually in the ongoing reports referred to in condition 7 above. Applicants will take immediate corrective action if this representation is not concurred in by the Independent Examiner, or appropriate substitute Independent Examiner. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. The prospectuses of the Funds will contain a statement to the effect that a salesperson and any other person entitled to receive compensation for selling Fund shares may receive different levels of compensation for selling or servicing one particular class of shares over another in a Fund. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. The Distributor will adopt compliance standards as to when each class of shares may appropriately be sold to particular investors. Applicants will require all persons selling shares of the Funds to agree to conform to such standards. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

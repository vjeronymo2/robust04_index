			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / International Bonds: New issues focus on continental European currencies NEW EUROBOND issues yesterday were concentrated on continental European currencies, as volatile conditions in the gilts and US Treasuries market held activity in the sterling and dollar sectors at bay. Positive sentiment on the French bond market encouraged buying of a FFr2bn long-dated issue for Electricite de France (EDF), the French electricity utility. The deal, which matures in 2012, took advantage of stronger demand for long-dated paper following the steepening of the French government bond yield curve. Following the French election and the latest money-market rate cuts on Tuesday, the French yield curve is now positive, except at the short end, with 20-year yields at 7.40, compared with 7.12 per cent for 10-year bonds. The yield curve is expected to steepen further, but additional rate cuts are likely to benefit the long end of the market, if less markedly than shorter-dated bonds. The EDF deal was launched at a yield spread of 33 basis points over the comparable OAT yield, but strong buying by European institutions, which are mostly bullish on the bond and currency markets, helped the spread tighten to 31 basis points. In the D-Mark sector, a DM200m issue for McDonald's Corporation, the US fast-food chain, caught retail investors' attention. Although the spread of 30 basis points above the Bobl 105 series German government bond did not appear unusually generous for a double-A-rated credit, the rarity of McDonald's debt, and its status as a household name, sparked a rush for paper. The issue traded as tight as seven basis points over the Bobl, before easing back to 14 basis points, according to lead-manager Deutsche Bank. The deal was snapped up by retail investors in Belgium, Luxembourg and Switzerland, dealers said. A DM200m five-year deal for Bancomext, the Mexican bank, was also targetted at retail investors, but was considered rather aggressively priced for a Latin American credit. In the dollar sector, a debut Dollars 100m issue for Corporacion Andina De Fomento (CAF), the Latin-American supranational agency which finances trade and infrastructure, was also the first straight offering by a Latin American borrower with an investment-grade rating. CAF was rated triple-B by Standard &amp; Poor's, the US rating agency, last month. Previously, CAF, which is jointly owned by the Andean pact countries, funded itself through the syndicated loans market, but now plans to diversify its investor base. A small dollar offering in the domestic Colombian market is also being prepared. Lead-manager Chemical Investment Bank reported good demand from institutional investors, encouraged by the investment-grade credit. A further Latin American deal, for Loma Negra, Argentina's largest cement company, is expected to be launched today. The Dollars 85m issue of five-year bonds is expected to be priced to yield 480 basis points over the comparable US Treasury issue.</p>

			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / Treuhand chief outlines aims The Treuhand agency charged with privatising east German business has secured contracts committing DM184bn (Dollars 106.9bn) in investment and guaranteeing 1.6m jobs, the agency said yesterday. It has sold 11,700 enterprises. However, in the course of fulfilling these contracts the jobs figure could fall to 921,000 permanent posts, while investments could be reduced to DM100bn, according to Mrs Birgit Breuel, the agency's president. Depending on the contract, an investor can gradually reduce the workforce, ending up with a final, permanent, figure agreed with the Treuhand. Mrs Breuel said implementation would be monitored by a management holding company, or VRA, in which private investors would be able to hold stakes of at least 25 per cent. In assessing the agency's targets for the next 12 months, Mrs Breuel told a news conference she was convinced the Treuhand had set up 'the framework for the economy in eastern Germany'. She said its main task this year would be privatising the remaining 266 enterprises, which employ about 100,000 people, or 2 per cent of eastern Germany's labour force. Seventy-three of these enterprises have already been hived off to five management groups, whose western German managers will restructure them before sale. The agency will try to restructure and sell by the end of the year the remaining 193 enterprises. However, Mrs Breuel could not confirm the level of subsidies required to prepare the enterprises for privatisation and keep the workforces employed. But she confirmed that by the end of 1994 the Treuhand would have spent DM275bn and earned DM68bn from sales.</p>

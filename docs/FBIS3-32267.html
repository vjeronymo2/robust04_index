			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on Nicaraguan economic developments monitored through 2  February; source follows in parentheses after each item.    President Violeta Chamorro inaugurated a stock exchange on 1  February for the first time in Nicaraguan history. This stock  exchange will strengthen the national financial system, and,  according to President Chamorro, its creation places Nicaragua  on par with other Central American nations. (Managua Sistema  Nacional de Television Network in Spanish 0100 GMT 1 Feb 94)    The government estimated today the five-day-old  transportation strike caused losses of approximately 60 million  cordobas, or, more than $9 million. An economist has said from  that amount, which represents for Nicaragua the revenues earned  from the total production of coffee, the government has lost  over 3 million cordobas, the equivalent of $500,000, in taxes.

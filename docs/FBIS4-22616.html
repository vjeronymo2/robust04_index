			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by PRAVDA correspondent Viktor Pritula: "All Flags </F> Come To Visit, Except Russian"]    [Text] Hanoi--The economic blockade of Vietnam is  lessening by the day. The Americans, for instance, understand  very well that any prospective economic niche will be filled by  their competitors. Even Austria did not remain out of the  action. Its government delegation signed an agreement on  construction of various communications projects.    I cannot cease being amazed by the powers of observation and  wit of my friend Linh Van Nhan. A specialist on Russia, he  regularly watches information programs on the "Ostankino"  channel. And once in a while comments on them. His latest  comment: "The ghost of the unforgettable Leonid Ilich has  returned to the Kremlin."    "What makes you think so?" I ask, perplexed.    "From watching Clinton's visit," replies Linh Van Nhan,  without blinking an eye. "You know very well how such historic  visits used to be covered in the past on the 'Vremya' program."    Needless to say, the dean of the Russian language department  had me flat on my back. True, in those "stagnation times" that  have already become part of mythology, when Linh Van Nhan was a  student at Voronezh University, Central Television was under the  direction of Suslov, the country's chief ideologist. Naturally,  all events involving our general secretary "for life" were  presented as historic milestones. Whenever someone visited  Moscow, "Vremya" expanded beyond any size.    For the Vietnamese press, television, and radio that are not  infected with "Ostankino" syndrome, the main news is still  closer to Vietnam.    For instance, much has been written about the visit to the  Vietnamese capital of prominent French political figure Jacques  Chirac. The mayor of Paris, who has his sights on the  presidency, decided--as did current president Mitterrand--to  build a solid bridge with the countries of Indochina, on the  reasonable assumption that in the future they will take their  proper place in the dynamically developing Asia-Pacific  corridor. In conversation with the Vietnamese leadership, Chirac  emphasized many times that France attaches priority significance  to developing relations with Vietnam. And this is not a mere  declaration. In terms of investment in the Vietnamese economy,  France is third in the world after Hong Kong and Taiwan, and  first in Europe.    One of the permanent foreign policy topics in the Vietnamese  mass media is the host of American delegations that have  descended on Vietnam. Congressmen, senators, and businessmen  have begun to frequent it. Still, business rules politics, no  matter how the latter may try to subordinate it. Representatives  of IBM, General Motors, AT&amp;T, Kodak, and a number of other  companies held consultations with Vietnamese Deputy Prime  Minister Phan Van Khai as part of the research group of American  industrialists and political scientists.    At a meeting with journalists, Ho The Lan, a representative  of the SRV Ministry of Foreign Affairs press department, read  out a long list of foreign delegations planning to visit  Vietnam. There were no delegations from Russia and the CIS  countries on that list. I have to admit that I am tired of  repeating the reasoning regarding the potential benefits of  cooperation with Vietnam. Therefore, today I will not do so. Let  those Russian officials who visited Vietnam last year do it.  They promised cooperation to the Vietnam side. And they were not  the only ones. Prime Minister Chernomyrdin himself talked to  Vietnamese Minister of Foreign Affairs Nguyen Manh Cam last fall  in Moscow. It is hard to tell, though, how much these promises  are worth.    But should we become like those Russian diplomats in Hanoi  who, in a pique of temper, accused local journalists of not  being objective in their coverage of Russian realities?    The discouraged Vietnamese colleagues, deprived of the  propaganda materials they used to get from the now-abolished  Hanoi bureau of RIA-NOVOSTI, are hurt by this allegation flung  at them by the diplomats.    "Is what we publish about Russia or show on television not  true?" one of the journalists asked me.    "Unfortunately, it is," I replied.</p>

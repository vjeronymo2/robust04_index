			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Notes on Northern Journey" by staff reporter Lo Ping (5012 </F> 0393): "Deng Xiaoping Directs Six Old Men To Take Over the  Reins After His Death"]    [Text] A break in tradition produced great repercussions  like thunder shaking the valley. The CPC top leaders strongly  and continuously criticized the television broadcasting of  footage of Deng Xiaoping's sickly appearance on 8 February. In  society, when people saw another face of the paramount leader,  who used to glow with vigor, they could not help but sigh: Deng  Xiaoping's days are numbered! A great question then arose in  their minds: What will happen after Deng's death???    The CPC Central Secretariat has now given out the following  message: Deng Xiaoping has made a five-point verbal  "injunction," and the most important point was that he directed  that: "After I pass away, you should consult Wan Li, Bo Yibo,  Li Desheng, Yang Dezhi, Gu Mu, and Jiwei when dealing with  important affairs."    It was noteworthy that Wan Li ranked first among the six,  causing people to recall a popular saying from the late 1970's:  "Go and see Wan Li if you want to have something to eat." In  those days, Wan Li was a provincial leader of Anhui and the  province took the lead throughout the country in adopting the  farmland contract system and breaking the people's-commune  structure. This was a very popular move and Wan Li also won  Deng Xiaoping's trust. It has yet to be verified whether Deng  now actually entrusts Wan Li with holding the reins as Mao  Zedong entrusted Hua Guofeng before his death by saying: "With  you in charge, I can set my mind at rest." We can believe this  is true for the time being.    What is mentioned above was the first point of Deng's  injunction. Before the remark "after I pass away," there was  another remark: "In recent years, the Central Political Bureau  and the State Council have been doing well-organized work and I  am glad to see this and also feel relieved." An interesting  fact is that on 7 March, when Jiang Zemin and Ding Guangen  relayed Deng Xiaoping's "five-point hopes" to the Political  Bureau, the Secretariat, and the State Council leading body  through Wang Ruilin (director of Deng Xiaoping's office), the  first point was as mentioned above; however, on the same day,  when Hu Jintao relayed this at a Central Secretariat meeting  attended by leaders of the provincial and municipal party  committees, some deletions were made. There was no remark about  "after I pass away" and only two of the six people were named:  Wan Li and Bo Yibo. The first point relayed by Hu Jintao read:  "Henceforth, you may consult such comrades as Wan Li and Yibo  whenever you find this is necessary."    By comparing the two versions relayed by Jiang Zemin and Hu  Jintao, one can easily see that first, the CPC leading body did  not want to make people think that Deng was going to "pass  away"; second, they tried to prevent people from taking Deng's  "instruction" as his "death-bed injunction"; and third, the  Political Bureau holds a consensus of opinion on Wan Li and Bo  Yibo, two of Deng's "bosom friends."    Anyway, CPC leaders at all levels are well aware that after  Deng's death, while Jiang Zemin and Li Peng are in charge of the  government, Wan Li and Bo Yibo will oversee them and play the  part that Deng Xiaoping is now playing.    In the not too distant future, if there are no changes like  those in East Europe and the former Soviet Union and no major  changes with "Chinese characteristics" in mainland China, after  Deng Xiaoping departs the human world, Wan Li and Bo Yibo will  take over Deng Xiaoping's political status. Wan Li may not have  the same authority as Deng Xiaoping has now but his hands are  not stained with the blood of the victims in the 4 June incident  and he is also more popular with intellectuals and ordinary  people than Deng in terms of being open-minded. Many people  have regarded Wan Li as a firm reform-minded leader for a long  time. Therefore, if Jiang Zemin and Li Peng actually follow  Deng's "injunction," the CPC will probably fare better than it  does now. Maybe, this is the reason why Deng Xiaoping selected  Wan Li and Bo Yibo as his "successors." Of course, the only way  out for the Communist Party is to terminate the rule-of-man and  one-party dictatorship and take the path of peaceful changes.    Apart from the abovementioned point, which was also the most  important point, Jiang Zemin and other leaders also relayed four  other points:    Exchange opinions and unify thinking inside the leading  body,  when handling major affairs and encountering major problems, and  make decisions and take actions resolutely and firmly.    Continue to consolidate and develop the system of democratic  centralism inside the party and take this as a major principle;  do not allow the existence of small "coteries" inside the  leading body.    Leading bodies at the central level and at the ministerial  and provincial level should consistently inspect things in  society and, thus, personally collect first-hand information.  They must not be divorced from the masses while handling a  multitude of affairs.    Continue to maintain the independent and peace-oriented  foreign policy as in the past, at present, and in the future;  resolutely oppose and resist hegemonism and power politics;  develop friendly relations with countries which are friendly  toward us and respect our sovereignty and internal affairs on  the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence; and  give priority to establishing and developing friendly, mutually  trusting, cooperative, and understanding relations with  neighboring countries. This should be our country's long-term  strategy.    Apart from the five points, Deng Xiaoping also mentioned  the issue of national reunification in his "injunction" about  what should be done after he "passes away." According to what  was relayed, Deng said: China will not be really prosperous and  powerful as long as the nation is still not reunified and  Taiwan's peaceful return is still unrealized. Every one of our  party members and cadres with the aspiration must not be  arrogant and must not relax their efforts as long as this  important mission is unfulfilled.    What is noteworthy in the remarks is the term "peaceful  return." Deng did not mention "peaceful liberation" or  "liberation through armed force." It was sensible of him not to  mention "liberation" but "return" because the people in Taiwan  are living in better conditions than ordinary people in the  mainland (both in their material and cultural lives) and they do  not need the Communist Party's "liberation." It is sensible and  realistic to mention "peaceful return" rather than "armed  liberation" because, once force is used, the Communist Party  will certainly become the accused in the court of morals.  People who are keen to launch a war and to kill their own  countrymen will certainly be punished by the 1.2 billion Chinese  people and the people all over the world. The four characters  of "peaceful return" [he ping hui gui 0735 1627 0932 2981] were  rather noticeable, because this showed that Deng Xiaoping  remained sober-headed, perhaps more sober-headed than before.  This is an extremely important message for the Taiwan  authorities and the people of Taiwan.    In order to strengthen the Deng Xiaoping Office and to keep  close ties between Deng and the Political Bureau, according to a  proposal by Wang Ruilin, director of the Deng Xiaoping office,  the Political Bureau appointed Deng Rong as deputy director of  the Deng Xiaoping Office, because Wang Ruilin had participated  in the actual leading body of the Central Military Commission  since January this year and was responsible for the political  and ideological work in the armed forces and the organization of  the leading bodies at units at and above the division level.  However, on learning that Deng Rong had been appointed deputy  director of his office, Deng Xiaoping deleted the relevant words  in the proposal and told Wang Ruilin: I object to this. This  is improper. Comrade Ruilin is able to properly handle many  things. Deng Rong often accompanies me, so she can be a  part-time assistant in the office but no official title should  be given to her. Please consider my opinion. Deng Rong's  official title caused people to recall that Mao Zedong made his  nephew Mao Yuanxin play the role of a liaison officer between  him and the Political Bureau in his later years. Deng Rong is  not equal to Mao Yuanxin but the traditional working mode of the  Political Bureau obviously remains the same. On this point,  Deng Xiaoping also has to follow Mao Zedong's example.    Undoubtedly, Deng Xiaoping has entered the last stage of his  life and is not far from the end. The CPC top leaders are aware  of this but they still try to extend Deng's life. The following  episode occurred in recent months:    In mid-February, 12 senior retired leaders, including Song  Renqiong, Song Ping, Yao Yilin, and Chen Zuolin, jointly wrote a  letter to the CPC Central Political Bureau and Jiang Zemin,  requiring that the Political Bureau properly take care of  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's health and take this as an important  matter entrusted by the whole party, the whole Army, and the  entire people of the whole country. The letter said: On 8  February, Comrade Xiaoping met with Shanghai CPC and Government  leaders when he was rather tired and the unfavorable impression  left with the whole nation, the whole party, and overseas  communities should not be underestimated. The central leading  body was wrong in making such an arrangement. They proposed  that the Central Political Bureau hold a meeting to discuss  arrangements to ensure Comrade Xiaoping's rest and recuperation  and to see that he was not bothered about any ordinary and  routine affairs which were not urgent nor critically important.  His rest must not be affected and disrupted. Reportedly, after  listening to opinions from Wan Li, Peng Zhen, Bo Yibo, Yang  Shangkun, and Wang Ruilin, Jiang Zemin made the following reply:  First, the Political Bureau will do its utmost to properly take  care of Comrade Xiaoping's health and ensure his longevity and  will bear the greatest responsibility to the whole party, the  whole Army, and the entire people throughout the country;  second, there is no need to change the resolutions adopted by  the First and Third Plenary Sessions of the 14th CPC Central  Committee.    At a party meeting in late February, Wan Li said: Comrade  Xiaoping's devotion to the party's cause and his strong will  power determine that he will not stay idle and will not just  rest without doing anything. Old comrades inside the party  should be well aware of this, so their criticism about that was  not serious.    Outside the Political Bureau, the CPC leadership continued  to  stress three points: First, Deng remains in good health;  second, he may sometimes have some minor illnesses; third, there  will be no trouble after he passes away. During the "two  sessions," Wan Li also answered questions about Deng's health  when receiving National People's Congress deputies and Chinese  People's Political Consultative Conference members. He said:  Comrade Xiaoping remains in good health. We play bridge twice  a week. Comrade Xiaoping's reaction is no worse than some  people in their 50's or 60's. However, he sometimes takes his  time in playing. He has no serious or fatal disease. As an old  man, he may be ill from time to time, and he has always been  receiving medical care. The central leadership has made careful  and concrete arrangements. After Comrade Xiaoping passes away,  there will be absolutely no change in our country's economy,  principles, and policies.    It is obvious that the CPC authorities are trying hard to  stabilize the situation and reduce the shocks once Deng passes  away. This is a strange phenomenon when a country is under the  rule of one person. Such "antishock therapy" is unimaginable in  the democratic world and such a thing is unprecedented and  unrepeatable there.</p>

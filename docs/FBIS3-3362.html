The session noted: Over the  past year, people of various nationalities in our country have  fully implemented the guidelines of the 14th CPC National  Congress and have triumphantly advanced along the path of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Our country  has enjoyed economic development, political stability, national  unity, and social progress, achieving significant results in  reform, opening up, and socialist modernization as well as  creating new prospects in all fields of work. The government  work report realistically summed up the work carried out by the  government over the past year. The basic principles guiding the  work in 1994, and the various key tasks outlined in the  government work report, are feasible and inspiring. CPPCC  members who attended the session expressed concern about some  current salient contradictions and problems such as the  overextended scale of investment in fixed assets, substantial  price increases, the relatively weak status of agriculture as  the foundation of the national economy, production and  management difficulties in some state-owned large and medium  enterprises, problems that merit attention in spiritual  civilization, various corrupt practices, and the poor state of  public order in some localities. They enthusiastically offered  their opinions and suggestions, and expressed the hope the  government would take strong measures to solve them in earnest.    The session noted: Realizing the great cause of reunifying  the motherland in accordance with the principles of "peaceful  reunification and one country, two systems" represents the  common aspiration of all Chinese people, including the  compatriots in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao as well as Chinese  nationals residing abroad. People from various parties and mass  organizations attending the CPPCC session, as well as people of  all nationalities and from all circles, firmly support the  various preparations made by our government to ensure a smooth  change of government and a smooth transition in Hong Kong and  Macao in accordance with the basic laws of the Hong Kong and  Macao Special Administrative Regions and with the relevant  resolutions made by the NPC and its Standing Committee. They  also firmly support our government's solemn stand on resuming  the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong on schedule, and on  maintaining Hong Kong's long-term stability and prosperity. The  session firmly opposed all attempts at or actions of splitting  the motherland, expressing the hope that differences between the  two sides of the Taiwan Strait would be solved through increased  contacts and consultation in accordance with the principle of  one China. We pin our hopes on the Taiwan authorities,  especially on the people of Taiwan.    The session maintained: 1994 is vitally important for our  country's advancement of reform, opening up, and socialist  modernization. We must steadfastly follow the guidance of  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics and the CPC's basic line; fully  implement the guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress and  the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee;  expedite the pace of building a socialist market economic  structure; and maintain sustained, rapid, and healthy  development in the national economy. We must also strengthen  democracy, the legal system, and socialist spiritual  civilization; maintain political stability; and promote overall  social progress. The overall task of the entire country is to  seize the opportunity, deepen reform, open up wider, promote  development, and maintain stability. All kinds of work in  people's consultation should submit to and serve this overall  task.    The session urged: All units involved in people's  consultation, CPPCC organizations at all levels, and CPPCC  members should raise the banner of patriotism and socialism and  follow the principles of "long-term coexistence, mutual  supervision, treating each other with all sincerity as well as  sharing weal and woe." They should earnestly implement the  guidelines of the current session, conscientiously improve  people's consultation and democratic supervision while taking  economic construction as the central task; actively participate  in the administration and discussion of state affairs; and keep  forging ahead in an uplifted, pioneering, and arduous spirit so  as to make fresh contributions to socialist modernization and  the peaceful reunification of the motherland.</p>

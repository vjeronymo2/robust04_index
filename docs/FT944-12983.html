			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Pocketing battleships The battle for VSEL is more likely to be decided by high politics than high finance. British Aerospace is campaigning for GEC's rival bid for the warship-maker to be blocked on competition grounds. So far, there is no definitive word from the Ministry of Defence. But GEC's purchase of a 14 per cent stake in VSEL suggests confidence on its part that the bid will receive the necessary approval. BAe's decision to focus on politics reinforces the impression that it has little chance of winning a straight financial fight. GEC's cash offer is worth 12 per cent more than BAe's paper offer. The financial logic of merging with VSEL is so attractive that BAe will be tempted to improve its bid. But the company is not in a position to put up cash and, if it offers more paper, its share price would fall - so diminishing the value of a higher bid. Meanwhile, the group knows GEC could easily use its cash mountain to top any improved offer. GEC's current bid of Pounds 14 a share should enhance the group's earnings by around 2 per cent, giving it scope to pay more cash without suffering dilution. VSEL is a pawn in a wider battle between GEC and BAe. Lord Weinstock, GEC's managing director, is anxious to force BAe to agree to a merger of the two groups' defence businesses before he retires. Without VSEL, BAe's balance sheet would be stretched. The company would find it harder to take the write-offs necessary to restructure its troubled turboprop business. That does not mean a BAe deprived of VSEL would automatically fall into Lord Weinstock's lap. But the pressure would be on.</p>

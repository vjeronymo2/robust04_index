			<p><P> September 26, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SPORTS ET CETERA: MONTE VISTA'S MCNAULL MAKES UP MIND, CHOOSES AZTECS  </P> <P> Joe McNaull, a 6-10 center from Monte Vista, will commit to San Diego State to  play basketball, Monte Vista Coach Zach Peck said Monday.  </P> <P> After visiting SDSU, McNaull made one other recruiting trip, to Arizona State,  before making his decision and canceling trips to Nevada Las Vegas, Utah and De  Paul.  </P> <P> "At San Diego State there was a chemistry," McNaull said.  </P> <P> McNaull averaged 18 points, 11 rebounds and four blocked shots a game as a  junior last season. Peck said he is a strong shooter and covers the floor well  for a big man.  </P> <P> "He's going to have to get stronger to be able to deal with the wear and tear  of college basketball," Peck said. "He's got a lot of growing to do."  </P> <P> McNaull, 17, plans to contribute as a freshman.  </P> <P> "I think I could play right away at SDSU," he said. "I just need to gain some  weight and gain some confidence."  </P> <P> Under NCAA rules, SDSU Coach Jim Brandenburg is not allowed to comment. DON  PATTERSON  </P></p>

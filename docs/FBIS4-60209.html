			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [by Laurence Peter] </F>   [Text] Sanaa, May 21 (AFP)--Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah  Salih called off a ceasefire on Saturday and vowed that his  northern forces would capture the key port city of Aden after  his southern rivals declared an independent state.    Salih told a press conference at the presidential palace  that  fighting had raged on after southern forces ignored a three-day  truce the north declared late Friday.    Southern troops were still fighting so "there is no  ceasefire," he said.    "We already said we were adhering to the ceasefire but the  separatist forces initiated fighting on all war fronts this  morning, so fighting is going on."    The president added: "We are now putting a military ring  around Aden," the former capital of Marxist South Yemen, which  united with conservative North Yemen four years ago.    "After putting this ring around Aden our intention was not  to  enter the city. However, after the announcement of separation  by the south we are obliged to enter the city at all costs."    He added: "Then the armed forces will continue to pursue the  separatists in al-Mukalla," a port east of Aden where his  southern rival Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid reportedly moved  his base earlier this week.    The northerners have been battling to reach Aden all week,  but had earlier said they would only blockade the city but not  enter it, and promised not to harm the civilian population of  more than 500,000.    The north had announced the ceasefire for the Moslem feast  of  'Id al-Adha (sacrifice), which starts on Saturday.    Asked how long the war, now in its third week, would last,  Salih said: "This decision can be made only by commanders in the  field. We hope it would end as soon as possible."    "We are facing the war machine of a former state which was a  member of the socialist bloc, armed to the teeth," he said.    But he added that Bid's army had lost 80 percent of its  equipment since the start of the conflict on May 5. He charged  that two Tupolev transport planes had arrived at al-Mukalla  airport and another ship was unloading military hardware at the  city's port.    "These aircraft and ships will be considered as the enemy,"  he warned.    He said a number of southern units had "declared loyalty to  the legitimate authority after they heard the declaration of  separation," especially the powerful 'Abbas brigade in the oil-  producing province of Shabwaho.    Several members of al-Bid's Yemen Socialist Party had also  assured him of their loyalty.    "Al-Bid has no cause," he said. "If he had a cause he would  have stayed in Aden, now he has escaped to al-Mukalla.    "Al-Bid will eventually have to run away to Oman or Saudi  Arabia. He will eventually have to join his separatist  colleagues living abroad. In fact, he has already sent away his  family."    Asked about possible support from other Arab countries for  al- Bid, Salih said: "Any Arab country or friendly state which  may try to sympathise with this position puts itself in the rank  of the enemies of the Yemeni people."    "This would represent a flagrant interference in Yemen's  internal affairs," he said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The farmers in the northern Upper Huallaga (San  Martin Department) who left that region after the brutal attacks  by the Shining Path and the MRTA [Tupac Amaru Revolutionary  Movement] are gradually but with determination returning to  their land. The people living in that region agree that what is  taking place now in that part of the country is the best result  of the pacification policy.    When subversion entered the Upper Huallaga region a few  years  ago--about the mid-1980's--mainly in some provinces of San  Martin Department, thousands of farmers and peasants had to  leave their farms or land to settle in the nearby cities or, in  the worst cases, to settle in the capital.    Subversion now has been practically eliminated and the  people  have returned, not with the intention of continuing to grow  coca, which is the raw material for the sinister narco-terrorist  alliance, but to grow other types of products that are more  profitable and can be exported.    For example, in 1992 rice growing in Tarapoto reached 12,000  hectares and so far this year the cultivation of this product  has already reached 30,000 hectares. It is expected that 50,000  hectares of rice will be grown by the end of this year.    The situation of the corn crop is also the same. Although  the  quality of corn is not the best, efforts are being made to  improve it to the exportable type required by the important and  demanding world markets.    But despite this limitation, Tarapoto's corn is wanted by  countries like Germany, which wants to buy 80,000 metric tons  even though this year's production is only expected to reach  20,000 metric tons.    This is why agricultural land is being prepared in order to  increase corn production considerably next year.    General Alfredo Rodriguez Riveros, general commander of the  Huallaga Front, said: ``The farmers welcome the intentions of  foreign importers.''    Regarding fruits, grape production is giving good  results--it  is being used for making wine and marmalade and sales are good.    A Peruvian farmer said: ``In Cumbaza we have rich land with  good production. Although the grape harvest is only once a year,  we have two harvests here.''    Gen. Rodriguez said: ``We are gradually making progress in  replacing coca, and the price of coca has dropped considerably  in all of San Martin Department.''    As an effective complement to this situation in the northern  Upper Huallaga, antidrug operations are eradicating cocaine base  although not definitively.    The work by the Air Police Directorate providing air support  to National Antidrug Division (Dinandro) patrols, and sometimes  to the Army, is ``suffocating'' the drug traffickers still  operating in the region.    An Air Police Directorate officer said: ``Ninety percent of  the antidrug operations are carried out through the use of  helicopters, and our unit is the only that can carry out this  type of operation.''    Although the people who live in the areas where drug  traffickers operate protected by the wild jungle of San Martin  reject the police action because the people in some way also  live off this activity, the ``blows'' have been hard and more  drug traffickers had to leave for other regions, where a  struggle also is being carried out against them.    An Air Police pilot said: ``We carried out several  interdiction operations in the last few weeks; an area is hit  after confidential information is received. We seized precursors  and drugs, and many people involved in this activity were  arrested.''    The struggle against drug trafficking probably will take  some  time but much less than the struggle against terrorism. But the  police operating in the area need more sophisticated equipment  to face this social scourge in a more effective manner.</p>

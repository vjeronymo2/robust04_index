			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / Arts: RSC lightweights come to London - Theatre The two 1992 stagings that the RSC has just brought to London - A Winter's Tale in the main Barbican, The Odyssey in the Pit - are both lively and both lightweight. One particular feature of the Winter's Tale production is that too few of the actors know how to make minor syllables, minor words, rapid and/or hushed utterance register to the sides and depths of the big theatre: a flaw that has made too many RSC transfers lightweight in the big Barbican Theatre. This Winter's Tale, which won several golden opinions in Stratford, is directed by Adrian Noble. It runs fluently, tells its story clearly, proves a good show. The groundless jealousy that makes Leontes so problematic a role becomes credible here; John Nettles's multi-faceted Leontes blows warm and cold, is trusting and suspicious. Yet when I remember Peter Hall's (by no means perfect) 1988 National Theatre Winter's Tale, I find that Noble's staging misses the play's scale. There is a high-flown edge of heroic melodrama to Leontes, making us stand apart from him even as he sucks us into his violent inner whirlpool; and so Tim Pigott-Smith showed. Nettles is sensitive, reasonable, but small-scale. He neither distances us nor draws us in. Paulina, by contrast, embodies good sense and moral outrage without ever soaring into such heights: and Eileen Atkins's raging force vibrates in the memory. Gemma Jones has both sense and sensibility, but her account of this winning role is a tad too elegant and refined. Samantha Bond's charming Hermione has more edge; and Andrew Jarvis's Antigonus is more directly communicative. Phyllida Hancock's Perdita is a fake-radiant country-bumpkin bore, and Richard McCabe's Autolycus is sour even when amusing. Anthony Ward's designs (with costumes veering between Victorian gowns and blue denim jeans) make a big gimmick out of balloons: entertaining, without illuminating the play. Derek Walcott's version of The Odyssey, as staged by Gregory Doran, is a vivid little dollop of multiculturalism and transhistoricism, recommended chiefly to politically-correct wet liberals. (Costumes range from Ancient Greek to traditional Caribbean. Accents, even among the residents of Ithaca, from Caribbean to south London. Parlance switches from 'My love is like a little black lamb asleep on a hill' to 'Me lost a husband too.') All of which, as applied here, shrinks Homer's world considerably. Walcott winds the old story up as if it were The Wizard of Oz, with Odysseus suddenly recognising the people of his 20-year absence in the faces of the folk back home. Walcott's revisionist account does nothing shocking, but it is soppy enough to make Odysseus win over mean old Thersites. This is not - is not meant to be - an epic. Just lots of poetry. Some of Walcott's lines are fine (Odysseus says of Ajax: 'He always strode as if earth were dung to his heels'), but there are over-many self-conscious purple patches in which one metaphor is piled too rapidly on another. And this Odyssey boils Homer's characters down into two-dimensional stereotypes. Ron Cook is a natural Odysseus (wily, fallible, determined), and perfectly judges this production's sub-heroic tone. Too many of the supporting roles are cheaply conceived, but Peter de Jersey plays Eurylochus, Achilles, and other roles with a kind of integrity that is arresting. In repertory at the Barbican and the Pit</p>

			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / Survey of Nottinghamshire Coalfields Regeneration (1): Base for expansion strengthens - Growing financial and services sectors and the availability of new funding are paving the way for investment The Nottinghamshire economy faces challenges in the 1990s, the scale of which was never dreamed of in the 1980s when the future of the coalfield seemed secure. These challenges involve a shift away from reliance on traditional industries to an economy based more widely on services and light manufacturing. The background is the sudden and drastic rundown of the coal industry as the power industry switches to the generation of electricity by gas, instead of by coal, its traditional fuel. The Nottinghamshire pits have been closely tied to the power generation industry. From 1961 to 1992, the number of pits had been declining, but slowly. The number fell from 39 to 13 while the number of pit jobs fell from 56,000, or 18 per cent of county's male workforce to less than 12,000. This was part of a nationwide phenomenon. But in the mid-1980s, after the end of the mineworkers strike and following the emergence during the strike of the Union of Democratic Mineworkers, the future of the rump of the industry looked secure. Margaret Thatcher, then prime minister, seemed to owe the UDM, the members of which stayed at work during the strike, a political debt for breaking the power of the National Union of Mineworkers. Within the last 18 months, however, since the announcement by Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary in October 1992, of a further rundown in the coal industry, a further nine Nottinghamshire pits have closed. The workforce has declined to 3,200 and is expected to be 2,800 by September. The county council believes at least Pounds 250m a year is being taken out of the economy, given the amount British Coal spent on wages and supplies. Such a sharp change in the fortunes of the local coal industry would have been difficult enough for the economy to absorb in the best of circumstances. But the rundown came when the economy was in recession. It coincided with the equally long-running problems of other staple industries: textiles, subject to intense overseas competition, and engineering where, also since the 1980s, there has been a decline in employment as employers have adopted new manufacturing techniques. Overall, the effect has been to reduce the strength of the county economy. 'In the early 1980s Notts had the highest gross domestic product of the five East Midlands counties,' said Howard Jackson, director of the Nottinghamshire County Council's planning and economic development department. 'We've slumped next to bottom place over Derbyshire. We've seen Leicestershire and Northamptonshire comes up the list, becoming the two most prosperous counties.' In social terms, Nottinghamshire's problem has been exacerbated by the physical concentration of the mines in the north and west of the county, frequently in villages whose reason to exist has been the pit, where the winding gear looks down on the estates of redbrick homes. Only Cotgrave has been in the south of the county. But the north and west also have concentrations of engineering and textiles companies. Unemployment has been consistently above the national average and in Mansfield, the largest town affected, it is more than 16 per cent. There are two immediate problems. The first is that of re-training redundant miners and fitting them back into the labour force of Nottinghamshire and the adjacent counties. The second is helping existing companies firstly to withstand the financial problems of emerging from recession and then to expand or strengthen existing operations. In the medium and longer term, the growth of the economy is dependent on diversification, especially in the north and west of the county. What form this might take is unclear. In the south, around Nottingham, the process is well-advanced with the growth, for example, of financial services and the development of the city as an office centre. Once considered as headquarters for English Heritage the city has been chosen for an Inland Revenue development. To help, a battery of services and funds is being made available, although Martin Gawith, deputy leader of the county council said that their work 'certainly is not as co-ordinated as well as it ought to be or could be'. Assistance to the county is coming in at three levels. At the local level, the county council, the training and enterprise councils (Tecs), local enterprise agencies and British Coal Enterprise are playing a role not only in the provision of training and job advice services but also in the provision of venture capital and loans to small companies. There has been some success in putting redundant miners back to work. British Coal Enterprise said it had been finding jobs at the rate of about 100 a week. But there is a difficulty. 'Each agency knows what it deals with. We don't have the capacity between us to say 'OK, we've lost 9,000 jobs since October 1992'. Where are all these people? What are they doing? Who are they? There's a worry a lot of people are staying at home, who've got lost, who are very isolated. It's an unknown,' said Pat Richards, chief executive of the North Nottinghamshire Training and Enterprise Council. The second level of help comes at the national and regional level. The government has largely funded East Midlands Development, which will spearhead the regional drive for inward investment and whose developing activities are thus watched closely in Nottinghamshire. The establishment this year of a new government office for the East Midlands, bringing together all departmental activities, should ease some co-ordination difficulties. It should prevent the sort of situation where, for example, the department of transport promises a level of funding for the Robin Hood railway line, to link Nottingham with Mansfield and Worksop, which the Treasury finds too high. At a financial level, there should be funding for the county from the government's single regeneration budget, depending on the skill of local private-public sector partnerships in putting bids together. Amounts are unclear. However, the government's designation of the north and west as an assisted area opens up the way for subsidies to companies creating jobs. It also smooths the way for the authorities in seeking funds from the European Union for specific projects. This European funding is the third level of assistance and the Nottinghamshire Council has calculated that there could be Pounds 65m available over the next three years. Growth trends seem linked in the immediate future to industries which are already established. The arrival in Mansfield of Toray Textiles, the Japanese group, and the decision by Johnson Controls, the US company, to make car seat covers in the town offer an immediate boost to the textiles industry and have opened up the possibility of a new industrial concentration. 'One company or group of companies can be the focal point around which others can circulate,' said John Finch, chief executive of East Midlands Enterprise. But such arrivals are rare and officials observe that the main stimulus to counteracting the rundown of the coalfield will be a national economic recovery. Surveys have shown that in Nottinghamshire, as elsewhere, order books are fattening and profitability has started to improve. The ground is ready for economic expansion. That, in its turn is the prerequisite for the sort of sustained corporate investment which would underpin the shift away from the historic dependence on the coalfield.</p>

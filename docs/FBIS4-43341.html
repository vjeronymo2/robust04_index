			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Gianfranco Fini, chairman of the Italian </F> Social Movement, by Daniela Horvath and Teja Fiedler; place and  date not given: "Mussolini Was Not a Criminal"]    [Text] [STERN] Mr. Fini, is Benito Mussolini still the  greatest Italian statesmen of this century for you?    [Fini] I never used this formulation. I said: Mussolini is  one of the men in Italy who embody this century best.    [STERN] Your present formulation is not precisely reserved.  Was the Duce a great politician or a bad dictator?    [Fini] Until 1938, until he put his signature on the racial  laws and his alliance with Hitler, fascism in Italy met with  broad agreement. Afterward, it was finished. What came  afterward was totalitarianism.    [STERN] Mussolini attacked Ethiopia and Albania even before  the "steel pact" with Hitler.    [Fini] At that time, other countries, for example, Great  Britain, were as imperialist as Italy. Today, however, there is  no longer room for it: neither for colonialism nor for  totalitarianism.    [STERN] The hawks in your party, however, have not yet  bidden farewell to classic fascism.    [Fini] These people are wrong. Fascism is no longer  up-to-date today.    [STERN] It is not only in Italy that one gets the impression  that its ideals are absolutely popular again.    [Fini] What is still valid are lasting values, such as the  defense of the family and the love of one's country.    [STERN] And the idea of the social state of solidarity,  which is allegedly supposed to take care of the poor?    [Fini] That, too, of course.    [STERN] These values are to be translated into reality arm  in arm with head of government Berlusconi of all people, an  industrial magnate who controls the course of tough economic  liberalism?    [Fini] We are not against the free market economy. What we  want is a social market economy like in Germany.    [STERN] The first thing that your government partner  Berlusconi proposed was to cut pensions and to introduce lower  wages in the Mezzogiorno, the anyway poor south of Italy, where  your party got the most votes.    [Fini] As long as we are in the government, there will be no  wages that are graduated according to regions.    [STERN] Your party friend and deputy head of government,  Giuseppe Tatarella, said it quite clearly the other day: I am  not a fascist. When will we finally hear this sentence from you?    [Fini] I see myself as a postfascist.    [STERN] What may we understand by that?    [Fini] This is quite simple: I have surpassed fascism, this  ideology is no longer necessary.    [STERN] At any rate, you stated recently in an interview in  a good fascist tradition that the question of the border with  Slovenia and Croatia is still "open" for you. When do you  intend to annex the Istrian peninsula?    [Fini] You should not only read the leftist press, which  constantly quotes me incorrectly: For me there has never been a  border problem. What we are interested in is the adequate  protection of the Italian minority.    [STERN] That is to say, the borders are inviolable for you?    [Fini] Borders are never immovable, but if this is done,  then only by negotiations, in our opinion.    [STERN] When did you actually discover the moderate fascist  in yourself?    [Fini] When communism broke down in Europe with the fall of  the Berlin Wall in 1989. Many people of my generation only  became fascists -- in quotation marks -- because communism  threatened our freedom.    [STERN] Not all members of your party seem to have taken  part in this change. For example, the Italian Social Movement  in Venice had a mass said in honor of Mussolini. And in the  party organ of your party, SECOLO D'ITALIA, an article that puts  homosexuality on the same level with rape, incest, and sodomy is  being published now.    [Fini] Wait a moment: This was not an article by the  editorial staff, but the polemic pleading of a guest author...    [STERN] ...which your paper printed in full without  dissociating itself from it.    [Fini] Our party line on the topic of homosexuality is  clear: Everyone can do with his body what he wants, as long as  he does it in his private sphere. But it is also clear that  homosexuality is not normal.    [STERN] And the memorial service for Mussolini?    [Fini] A memorial service for the dead is not an attack on  democracy.    [STERN] If a mass were said today in honor of Adolf Hitler,  the world would be topsy-turvy.    [Fini] After all, Hitler was a criminal.    [STERN] And the Duce?    [Fini] It was Mussolini's greatest error to get involved  with Hitler. However, the difference is that there is hardly  anyone in your country who grieves for Hitler today, while many  Italians are still convinced today that Mussolini achieved a lot  of good things. At any rate, he was not a criminal.    [STERN] What about the racial laws, the prosecution of  political opponents?    [Fini] The racial laws were also a tragic error of  Mussolini.    [STERN] Why did you, as the strong man of your party, not  become a member of the government?    [Fini] For the time being, I want to take care of the party  and explain our attitude toward fascism today to the world.    [STERN] Why do you not start in Bologna, where your European  candidate Piero Buscaroli suggested internment camps for  homosexuals?    [Fini] I do not believe that he said such a thing.  Buscaroli is one of the most important musicologists in Italy.  Hence, music and camps -- they do not go together.    [STERN] The concentration camp commanders liked to have  Wagner and Beethoven played to them by the prisoners' orchestras.    [Fini] Wagner, but certainly not Rossini.    [STERN] You are not trusted abroad: Your ministers are  booed at, people refuse to shake hands with them -- like in  Belgium. Statesmen like Francois Mitterrand or newly elected FRG  President Roman Herzog are warning against a right-wing  development like in Italy. Is the Waldheim effect, Italy's  isolation, imminent?    [Fini] The whole thing is a campaign before the European  elections that is directed by the European left.    [STERN] Herzog is really not suspected of left-wing ideas.    [Fini] Your president certainly talks and acts with the best  of intentions, but he clearly fell into the trap set by European  socialists like Mitterrand or Papandreou; they are afraid that  the right will win everywhere in the European election.</p>

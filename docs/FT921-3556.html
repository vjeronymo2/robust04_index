			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / World Trade News: France lifts curb on S Africa coal THE French government has lifted its embargo on imports of South African coal, as a gesture of support for the reforms being undertaken by President F W de Klerk, writes Our Foreign Staff. The coal import restriction, imposed in 1985, is the last French curb on trade with South Africa apart from the UN embargoes on arms and oil. Before 1985, South Africa was supplying about 6.4m tonnes of coal, or about 30 per cent of total consumption, to France.</p>

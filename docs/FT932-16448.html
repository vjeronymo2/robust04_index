			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Paying over the odds for overdrafts - In a Nutshell Many small firms pay between 5 and 10 per cent above base rate for overdraft finance, according to a survey of Northern Ireland businesses. Thirty per cent of firms with overdrafts paid interest at 5 per cent above base or higher. Some companies in the services sector paid 10 per cent above base - a total of 16 per cent - while manufacturing companies paid up to 9 per cent above base. These were not isolated cases and possibly reflected a failure to appreciate that rates were negotiable, the authors noted. One in six service businesses and one in 10 manufacturers were unaware of the rates they were being charged. The survey covered 1,000 firms employing fewer than 100 people each.

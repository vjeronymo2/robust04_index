			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with PLO Executive Committee member Shafiq al-Hut </F> by an unidentified correspondent in Beirut on 4 May -- recorded]    [Text] [Al-Hut] Although I have not acquainted myself with  the details of the Palestinian-Israeli agreement, I think it is  based on the Israeli interpretation of the Oslo Agreement. This  is also what happened with regard to the other agreements, such  as that on the crossings, which was signed in Cairo. Perhaps  what we and millions of viewers saw today when Yasir 'Arafat  refused to sign the agreements and then finally submitted to  various pressures and made another concession to ensure the  success of the ceremony proves this point. But this does not  rule out that the signing of this agreement constitutes a  significant move in the sense that the differences over the  negotiations will be seen on the ground, in the popular arena.  I think there is cause for concern when the implementation  takes place according to the Israeli interpretation. The  Palestinian Arab people will discover the grave loss suffered by  the Palestinian cause as a result of the Oslo Agreement, the  basis of all the agreements, including today's agreement.    [Correspondent] What are the prospects for the peace process  in the area after the signing of the agreement?    [Al-Hut] My feeling is that we are drawing away from peace  more than many people think, especially those who support this  process according to the current framework and agreements. The  situation of the Palestinian people has not changed. Perhaps it  is even worse than before 13 September 1993. There has been no  progress on the Lebanese, Syrian, or Jordanian tracks. This  means there is still a long way to go. This way is fraught with  dangers. I see the possibilities for an explosion are perhaps  greater than the possibilities for peace.</p>

			<p><P> June 10, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> WOMAN SEES SATANISM IN CHILD-ABUSE CASES;  </P> <P> SHELTER: SHE OPERATES AN UNDERGROUND NETWORK TO HIDE YOUNGSTERS FROM ALLEGEDLY  ABUSIVE PARENTS. CRITICS CHARGE SHE'S OPERATING OUTSIDE THE LAW.  </P> <P> In the view of children's rights crusader Faye Yager, a shadowy, satanic  brotherhood manipulates the nation's courts, haunts the police and allows  children to suffer unspeakable evil.  </P> <P> A 30-room English Tudor mansion -- complete with housekeeper, gardener and  Rolls-Royce parked outside -- protects Yager from that world.  </P> <P> Her home is the headquarters of an underground network through which, she says,  thousands of volunteers in 50 states have hidden hundreds of children from  abusive parents.  </P> <P> Police came to the house in April with a search warrant, looking for files or  videotapes to back up a Florida woman's claim that Yager had tried to browbeat  the woman's children into accusing their father of satanism and abuse.  </P> <P> Since Yager's arrest April 14 on charges related to that complaint, Cobb County  police have received calls from throughout the country, many on behalf of  fathers who hope the network will be dismantled and their missing children  returned, police Lt. Robert Pittman said.  </P> <P> "It's very frustrating to a father who's been cleared of any wrongdoing  whatsoever to know there's a nationwide organization whose avowed purpose is to  remove children from the jurisdiction of our courts," said Thomas A. Massey, an  Evansville, Ind., attorney.  </P> <P> Massey represents John Rademacher, whose ex-wife and 8-year-old daughter, Sara,  have been missing since last November, presumably hidden through Yager's  services.  </P> <P> Authorities seized about 40 files and tapes from Yager's home, but she said the  network was not exposed by the search.  </P> <P> "I'm not stupid. I don't keep anything that's going to lead to any kids, but  they don't know that," she said.  </P> <P> Yager, a 40-year-old former interior designer, started Children of the  Underground three years ago for the purpose of sheltering abused youngsters she  believes have been abandoned by the court system. She estimates she has helped  500 families or more, with one to six children each.  </P> <P> The case against Yager, expected to be argued before a grand jury this summer,  involves a Florida woman who said she asked the organization for protection  because her husband physically abused her, their 8-year-old daughter and  10-year-old son.  </P> <P> Yager is charged with kidnaping the boy and subjecting him to cruel verbal  treatment; a kidnaping charge involving the girl later was reduced to  interfering with the custody of a child.  </P> <P> Police contend that Yager threatened to send the children back to their father,  who she said would beat them, if they refused to make accusations against him.  </P> <P> Cobb County Dist. Atty. Tom Charron described Yager as a woman of good  intentions who has become obsessed.  </P> <P> Yager denies the criminal charges, but does not entirely disagree with  Charron's assessment of her.  </P> <P> "I am obsessed," she conceded in an interview at her home in affluent Sandy  Springs in suburban Atlanta. "I'm obsessed with a legal system, a system  designed to protect that destroys. I'm obsessed with this cult business that is  allowed to operate. These people are Ozzie and Harriet by day, and get away  with it."  </P> <P> She claims that many prominent lawyers and judges are "generational satanists"  brought up to believe in Satan.  </P> <P> In her basement files, records involving "cult" cases are earmarked with bright  orange tabs.  </P> <P> Sitting in a room filled with antiques, she strings together story after story  of children who say they were abused, many by fathers or relatives involved in  occult activities. In a voice often just above a whisper, she tells of girls  used as Satanic "breeders" to produce babies for their tormentors to sacrifice.  </P> <P> At times, she stops to introduce a grandmother who works with the network, or  to chat with an abused teen-ager who is among her house guests.  </P> <P> The case against her, Yager said, never will go to trial. She said that police  and FBI agents assisting in the investigation are harassing her family and  trying to destroy her credibility, especially among law enforcement officials  who have trusted her.  </P> <P> "My credibility has been tarnished, tarred and feathered. I've been slandered,"  she said.  </P> <P> Her history with Cobb County authorities dates back to 1973, when the courts  awarded custody of her own daughter, Michelle, to the child's father, Roger Lee  Jones, even though Yager claimed he had sexually abused the girl.  </P> <P> She launched her underground crusade in 1987, the year after Jones was indicted  on nine counts of child molestation involving three minors in Venice, Fla. He  still awaits trial on the charges.  </P> <P> Memories of what happened to her daughter, who now lives with Yager and her  current husband, keep her bent on helping other children, she said.  </P> <P> FBI agent Jeff Holmes accompanied police in the search of Yager's house a few  days after her arrest, but won't say whether the FBI has undertaken a broad  investigation of the network.  </P> <P> Charron said that until the missing children are found or their locations are  revealed, authorities can do nothing.  </P> <P> "Until you have the children or proof of where they are, you don't have the  elements of a crime," he said.  </P> <P> Any broad action involving the network would be up to the FBI because Cobb  County has limited jurisdiction, Charron said.  </P> <P> Yager's detractors say she is a media princess carried away with publicity.  </P> <P> Denise Gooch, a founder with Yager of the nationwide organization Mothers  Alliance for the Rights of Children, described her as a "reporter's dream and a  parent's nightmare."  </P> <P> She was asked to leave because of philosophical differences and began her own  network the same year, said another founder, Sarah King.  </P> <P> Yager admits she doesn't shun attention.  </P> <P> Her gardener drove her to a preliminary hearing in her husband's Rolls-Royce.  She wore a hat, a floral print dress and a corsage. She listened as her  attorney told the judge she should not pay court costs because she is indigent.  </P> <P> "Howard Yager doesn't have to pay for attorneys for his wife. I have no  income," she said, adding that she transferred her property and money to her  husband's name before she started the underground.  </P> <P> Authorities have criticized Yager's interview techniques with children. They  say she intimidates them and often brings up the subject of satanism.  </P> <P> "She's not objective," said Pittman, the Cobb County police lieutenant. "We  feel she intimidates the child into saying things that aren't true."  </P> <P> Some videotapes, Pittman said, show Yager "screaming and hollering at kids,  threatening to send them back into an abusive situation."  </P> <P> Yager, who has the children sit in a high-backed Renaissance-style chair in her  library while she videotapes them, denied she is abusive.  </P> <P> "I'm very blunt about things," she said. "I tell them, 'You're at the end of  the road. If I can't help you, not many people out there are going to.' "  </P> <P> She also denied bringing up satanism. She said: "I don't want to believe things  like that are going on. I'm being forced to believe it."  </P> <P> Helen Russell, a friend who has watched some of the interviews, defended  Yager's style and her ideas about cults.  </P> <P> "Isn't it easier to think one woman is crazy," Russell asked, "than to think  our society has gotten so perverted?"  </P></p>

Yavlinskiy told reporters that in his government current  Finance Minister Boris Fedorov would chair the Central Bank,  while Anatoliy Chubays would remain the privatisation supremo.    The leader of the Yabloko parliamentary faction said he had  not received any offers to join the government of Viktor  Chernomyrdin, but had there been any he would have "submitted a  programme of extreme anti-crisis measures in three weeks".    However, Yavlinskiy added that he would assume the  responsibility "only on condition that the president exerts no  pressure and does not interfere".    Yavlinskiy believes that First Deputy Premier Yegor Gaydar  had resigned because of the economic situation which had sharply  aggravated of late.</p>

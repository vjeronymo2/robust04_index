			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Progressive Forces Seek New Man for </F> `Return Match'"]    [Text] Rome -- The official watchword at PDS [Democratic  Party of the Left] headquarters is definite: Occhetto's  leadership is not in question within the PDS. The top leaders  say so by implication, and the party leader himself said so  forcefully at a Directorate meeting. But after the election  defeat the debate on the pros and cons of a change of leadership  for the major party of the progressive alignment is enlivening  the debate between the various tendencies within the Left. It  is even challenging the assumption that the leader of the  "return match" against the Right, victorious in the 28 March  elections, must necessarily be of communist extraction. Even  within the PDS there are growing signs of a situation in flux.  It is unanimously agreed that the process is bound to  accelerate after the European elections in June, which demand a  cautious attitude on everyone's part. It is only then that we  will see the start of the debate leading up to the congress in  the fall, clarifying the intentions of the various protagonists,  who are now busy mainly with examining what is to be done,  without revealing their respective hands.    Against the background of the now almost proverbial rivalry  between Occhetto and [PDS Deputy Secretary] D'Alema, a conflict  over policy line is emerging, based essentially on the choice  between, on the one hand, "renewal" and the "stability" of the  leadership and, on the other, the problem of the PDS' new role.  It is the basic substance of the debate between those aiming at  a dissolution with a view to the establishment of the  "democratic party" and those, on the other hand, who insist on a  "strong relationship" with the center by an organizationally  autonomous Left -- two stances that seem to be represented by  [L'UNITA editor] Walter Veltroni and Massimo D'Alema,  respectively.    Significantly, a rapid opinion poll conducted by LA  REPUBBLICA yesterday among some 40 progressive deputies and  senators indicates the editor of L'UNITA and the former PDS  lower house speaker as the two favorite candidates for the  leadership of the alignment, out of a choice that also includes  figures from outside the PDS, such as former Deputy Stefano  Rodota, Mayor of Rome Franco Rutelli, Socialist Valdo Spini, and  Mayor of Venice Massimo Cacciari. One- third of those  interviewed expressed no preference, but three-fourths of the  sample seemed convinced that a change of guard is essential. If  the same opinion were to become current within the PDS itself,  the fall congress could indeed prove to be Occhetto's last as  secretary.</p>

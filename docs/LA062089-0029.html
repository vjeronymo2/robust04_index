			<p><P> June 20, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> COFFEE SHOP BEEFS UP CULTURAL LANDMARK PROPOSAL  </P> <P> Hamburgers are the latest weapon being used by San Fernando Valley residents  who have a beef with a mini-mall builder trying to tear down a "landmark"  Studio City carwash and gas station.  </P> <P> Preservation-minded homeowners were treated to 99-cent burger specials Monday  as they announced that a 1950s-style coffee shop next to the gas station will  be added to their monument application when it is considered Wednesday by the  city's Cultural Heritage Commission.  </P> <P> Residents are seeking monument status for the southeast corner of Ventura and  Laurel Canyon boulevards as a way of preventing a developer from demolishing  the gas station and carwash and building a $15-million mini-mall.  </P> <P> Two weeks ago, a commission member visiting Studio City to inspect the carwash  and gas station commented to residents that their application might be  strengthened if it included the 28-year-old Tiny Naylor's Restaurant along with  the automotive facilities.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Googie' Look  </P> <P> The coffee shop is built with a modernistic look known as the "Googie" style to  preservationists. It uses angular steel beams that form wing-like exterior  supports for the restaurant.  </P> <P> The nearby carwash has a similar look. Residents say its three 55-foot-tall  boomerang-shaped steel beams honor the Valley's car culture and form a fitting  "Gateway to Studio City."  </P> <P> Restaurant operators rolled back the price of hamburger-fries-and-Coke specials  to 1963 levels Monday to help monument supporters reminisce while they filled  Tiny Naylor's vinyl-covered booths.  </P> <P> Years ago, the coffee shop was one of the few restaurants in the southeastern  Valley that was open around the clock. So it was a popular hangout for  teen-agers growing up in the 1960s, said Jack McGrath, organizer of the  save-the-carwash campaign.  </P> <P> "In the 1960s, all the kids around here came here," agreed Sunny Gillis, 43, a  1963 graduate of North Hollywood High School who lives in Burbank. "Coming here  was like going to the circus or going fishing with your dad. This is where you  fell in love, got beat up, got drunk. And all that could happen before lunch."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Clubs Met There  </P> <P> Linda Knieps, 41, a member of North Hollywood High's class of '65, said the  coffee shop was a favorite meeting place for social clubs that were popular on  campus. "I was a member of the Chanteclair's. It was the most fun to come here  after football games or club meetings. I was really upset when I heard that a  mini-mall might be built here. We don't have enough nostalgic landmarks left."  </P> <P> Tiny Naylor's officials -- who served about 300 hamburger plates during a  90-minute period Monday -- pledged to spend $75,000 to restore the coffee shop  to its 1960s splendor if commissioners make the restaurant a monument. A  cultural designation would prevent developer Ira Smedra from demolishing the  corner for a year.  </P> <P> "You remember the counter and the tile and the soda jerks? That's what we'll  bring back," Randy Peters, the restaurant chain's chief operating officer, told  reporters -- including a Voice of America broadcaster preparing a report for  European listeners.  </P> <P> The old-fashioned look won't apply to the menu, however. A hamburger, fries and  a Coke will cost $4.50, officials said.  </P></p>

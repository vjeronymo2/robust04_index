			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / UK Company News: Static year for George Weston George Weston Foods, the Sydney-based food company controlled by Associated British Foods, returned static profits for the year to January, writes Bruce Jacques in Sydney. Net profits were steady at ADollars 49.3m (Pounds 21.5m) on a small sales gain to ADollars 939.6m. The annual dividend is held at 14 cents with a same-again 9.5 cents final. Poor market conditions prevented the company from reaping the rewards of cost cutting during the year. The Queensland bread operations suffered significant losses and overall bakeries results were hit by higher wheat prices and a consumer move to downmarket brands. Trading margins had not improved so far in the current year.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Bi Quanzhong (3968 0356 1813) and </F> XINHUA reporter Yin Hongzhu (1438 7703 4376)]    [Text] Beijing, June 17 (XINHUA) -- The national education  conference closed in Beijing this afternoon. Delivering a  summation speech at the conference on behalf of the party  Central Committee and the State Council, Li Lanqing, member of  the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and vice premier of  the State Council, called on the whole party and all sectors of  society to act energetically to implement the guidelines of the  conference and to strive to make contributions to help China's  education system flourish.    Ding Guangen, member of the CPC Central Committee Political  Bureau and Secretariat, presided over the closing ceremony.  Attending the conference were leading comrades, including Wei  Jianxing, Wen Jiabao, Song Jian, Li Guixian, and Ismail Amat.  Responsible comrades from the central committees of the various  democratic parties and leaders of the All-China Federation of  Industry and Commerce were invited to attend the conference.    In his speech, Li Lanqing said: In convening this high-level  conference, the party Central Committee and the State Council  aimed to mobilize the whole party and all sectors of society,  beginning with high-ranking leaders of the party and government,  to earnestly implement the "Outline" [Outline Program for the  Reform and Development of Education in China], push forward the  reform and development of education in China, and enable  education to make greater contributions to China's socialist  modernization drive. Delegates attending the conference said  unanimously that Comrade Jiang Zemin's important speech and  Comrade Li Peng's keynote report showed great foresight and  contained both strategic principles and pragmatic and specific  policies and measures, all of which demonstrated the  determination of the party Central Committee and the State  Council to attach importance to the development of education,  and also demonstrated their ardent expectation that all sectors  of society would attach importance to the development of  education.    Li Lanqing stressed: The fundamental way to solve  educational problems in China is reform. Of course, we must  also make conscientious efforts to tackle the practical  difficulties and problems facing education. China is a  developing country with nearly 1.2 billion people and a  relatively backward economy, but it is running education at a  scale that surpasses that of every country in the world. With  limited financial strength, China will not be able to put  sufficient funding into education to meet practical needs. This  will remain a contradiction for a long time to come. We must  proceed from reality, improve educational efficiency in China  through reform of education, and find a new path for the  development of education that suits China's national conditions.  He pointed out: Making nine-year compulsory education  universal and eliminating illiteracy among young and middle-aged  people in China by the end of this century constitute the  foundation for raising the quality of the whole nation and the  cornerstone for China's socialist modernization drive. The  whole party and every sector of society must take the  realization of these "two basic goals" as an urgent and  magnificent historical mission. To ensure the realization of  the "two basic goals," they must vigorously create conditions  and overcome difficulties. The "two basic goals" set by the  conference are: To make, by the end of this century, nine-year  compulsory education standard in about 85 percent of the  populated areas, with school attendance rates in middle schools  reaching 85 percent; and make the literacy rate among young and  middle-aged people 95 percent. This is in accord with China's  national conditions, and we are confident of fulfilling the  objectives. We have made elementary education universal in 91  percent of the populated areas, with attendance by school-age  students in elementary schools reaching 98.3 percent, and that  of students in junior middle schools 73 percent. The  development of the economy in the 1990's will provide a better  material basis for educational development. Because China is a  huge country with a vast territory, and conditions in each area  differ considerably, we have formulated a principle according to  which programs will be drawn up in line with the characteristics  of each region, guidance will be offered in line with specific  conditions, and implementation of programs will be carried out  step by step. In line with the actual conditions in each  region, we have set the goal and a deadline for making education  universal, and put forward methods and modes of running schools  as well as corresponding measures for educational reform. We  will not insist on uniformity, and this will help enhance the  initiative of different regions in fulfilling the "two basic  goals." At present, three are 36 million illiterates among  China's young and middle-aged people. In the past few years,  the number of illiterates has been reduced by about 5 million  each year. At this rate, it is possible essentially to  eliminate illiteracy among young and middle-aged people by the  end of this century if governments at all levels and all sectors  of society work conscientiously toward this goal.    Li Lanqing said: The difficulty in making nine-year  compulsory education universal lies in the countryside,  especially in poor areas. In developing education in the  countryside, we must resolutely change the guiding principle of  running schools divorced from rural economic construction, which  exists in varying degrees, and find a way of running schools  suited to local conditions. In developing rural education, we  must increase investment and improve the conditions for running  schools. At the same time, we should vigorously encourage  overall planning for elementary, middle school, and high school  education and the integration of agriculture with science and  education. In either nine-year education or six-year education,  students should learn to read and write well and cultivate fine  moral integrity and civilized habits. On this basis, some  vocational skills and knowledge of applied science should be  taught.    Li Lanqing said: In achieving the "two basic goals,"  efforts should also be made, first, to go all out to cultivate  qualified teachers and run normal schools well; second, to  continue to run enterprise-affiliated middle and primary schools  and kindergartens well while changing the operating mechanisms  of enterprises and establishing a modern enterprise system;  third, to give special aid to the education of ethnic minority  people; fourth, to pay close attention to various kinds of  special education and nursery and preschool education and attach  importance to problems related to girls' school attendance; and  fifth, to combine the drive to wipe out illiteracy with programs  on studying general knowledge and technical skills and  disseminating socialist spiritual civilization.    Discussing vocational and adult education, he said:  Vigorously promoting vocational and adult education is the only  effective way to train large numbers of skilled people, which  conforms with China's national conditions; it is also the only  way to modernize education and revitalize the economy. In China  today, those who are able to attend colleges and universities  are, after all, the minority. The overwhelming majority of  young people, after undergoing basic education up to a certain  age, can acquire skills only through vocational education. We  must vigorously promote vocational and adult education so as to  provide opportunities for them to receive technical and  professional training and to enable them to become qualified  workers with suitable skills needed by society. He said: Adult  education is a new form of education which develops the  traditional school education to a life-long learning process;  and it is of great importance to raising the quality of the  nation and directly and effectively promoting economic and  social development. We should go all out to run various adult  educational institutions well so as to update the knowledge of  people who are employed and to continually raise their  ideological and cultural qualities and professional capabilities.    Discussing reform of the higher educational system, he said:  Schools of higher learning are the primary bases for training  high-level talented personnel and developing science and  technology, and the development of science and technology is the  fundamental guarantee for realizing China's second- and  third-step strategic goals of development and for meeting the  challenges in the 21st century. To accomplish this glorious and  yet arduous task, China's schools of higher learning must  further improve the quality of education and efficiency of  school management through reforms. He discussed, in particular,  views on reforming schools administered by departments. He  said: The system of running schools of higher learning by  departments took shape when the structure of a planned economy  was in effect; and it played an important and positive role in  developing higher education in the past. However, such a system  of administering schools of higher learning, characterized by  barriers between different departments, was one of the major  causes for the "small but comprehensive" system, redundant  establishment of schools and majors, and poor efficiency. Along  with the gradual deepening of the economic structural reform,  such maladies have become increasing obvious, causing more and  more serious problems for schools of higher learning.  Therefore, it is imperative to carry out reform systematically  in line with the goal set forth in the "Outline." At present,  there are some 300 schools of higher learning administered by  ministries and central departments. Through the joint efforts of  various sectors in the past more than a year, dozens of them  have shifted or are trying to shift to joint management with  local communities, while many of them are preparing for reform.  In the future, schools of higher learning administered by  ministries and central departments should focus reforms on  expanding their services and increasing majors. They should  gear themselves to the needs of society, run schools  independently, encourage management of schools in various forms,  rationalize the distribution of schools, and raise the  efficiency of school management. Except for special trades and  professions in need of continued management of a few backbone  schools, the majority of schools should gradually shift from the  system of management at the central and provincial levels to the  system at the provincial level so as to allow provinces,  municipalities, and autonomous regions to map out overall  arrangements and rationally distribute schools of higher  learning within their jurisdiction, thereby reducing the  unnecessary redundant establishment of schools and majors and  concentrating manpower and material resources on improving the  quality and standards of a number of schools of higher learning.  All relevant central departments should continue to strengthen  support and leadership over their affiliated schools of higher  learning. The purpose of reform is to improve the quality and  efficiency of these schools and alleviate their difficulties in  running schools. He pointed out: The task is difficult and  needs all-out cooperation and support from all sectors. In  carrying out the reform, it is necessary to proceed from the  realities, adopt a positive approach, and take prudent measures.  The majority of ministry-affiliated schools may begin various  kinds of joint management with local communities and then later  delegate managerial autonomy to them after conditions are ripe.  Where conditions permit, managerial autonomy can be delegated  to local communities immediately. In a nutshell, it is  necessary to stress actual benefits, and guard against formalism  and rushing headlong to delegate managerial autonomy.    As for intensifying and improving schools' moral  education, Li Lanqing pointed out: While intensifying education  on patriotism, socialism, and collectivism, we should also  compile Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism  with Chinese characteristics into teaching materials for  educating young people. We should attach importance to education  about China's moral traditions, living examples should be used  for education about the national situation, attention should be  paid to aesthetics education, and efforts should be made to  educate students about the Constitution and to be law-abiding  citizens.    Commenting on issues of common concern within educational  circles and in society as a whole, Li Lanqing said that more  resources must be channeled to education. He said: The State  Council departments concerned and governments at all levels must  carry out the specific requirement which Premier Li set out in  his report -- that governments must increase their investment in  education. All provinces must increase their educational  budgets in light of their goals for educational development.  Meanwhile, in accordance with the needs for deepening various  reform projects, educational funds should be raised through  various avenues and continual efforts should be made to improve  the mechanisms that ensure inputs for education. Li Lanqing  pointed out: Teachers hold the key to educational reform and  development. Governments at all levels are duty bound to raise  teachers' social status and their pay as the "Teachers Law"  requires. This responsibility should be shared by governments  at all levels and all relevant departments. While the Central  Committee, the State Council, and governments at various levels  have done a great deal of work since 1993 in paying teachers'  unpaid wages, new arrears have again been incurred. This  problem should never be treated lightly. We must clearly  understand that teachers' being able to receive their wages in  full and on time is an important provision of the "Teachers Law"  as well as a basic right of the vast number of teachers. It is  a direct responsibility of governments at all levels to resolve  and guard against the problem of the delayed payment of  teachers' wages. Principal leading comrades of all party  committees and governments must seriously approach and resolve  this problem. Li Lanqing also commented on issues concerning  teachers at nongovernment schools, the unauthorized  establishment of universities and colleges, unauthorized student  enrollment, improving the quality of meals at universities and  colleges, and subsidizing students who have financial  difficulties.    Li Lanqing told all localities and departments that they  must  promptly convey the guidelines laid down in the educational  conference and organize the vast number of cadres and masses to  study Comrade Jiang Zemin's important speech and Comrade Li  Peng's report. He said: Relevant departments of the State  Council and party committees and governments of all provinces,  autonomous regions, and municipalities under the central  government's direct jurisdiction must earnestly study and draw  up plans and measures for implementing the guidelines laid down  by the conference. He stressed: Implementing the "outline" as  well as the views on implementing the "outline" is the  responsibility of governments at all levels. Party committees  and governments at all levels should place the implementation of  this "outline" high on their agendas and should draw up specific  measures for implementing the "outline." Leading cadres must  earnestly change their leadership style and methods of work; and  principal leaders must personally investigate, study, and handle  major problems arising from implementing the "outline."    In his speech, Ding Guangen said: This conference was an  important conference in China's history of educational  development. The conference is a complete success thanks to the  direct leadership of the party Central Committee and the State  Council, as well as to the efforts exerted by comrades attending  the conference. Education has a close bearing on training  personnel for the 21st century, on China's economic  revitalization, and on the nation's future. We must display the  spirit of holding ourselves responsible for the state and the  nation and earnestly follow through with the assignments put  forward by the conference so as to create a situation in which  China's educational cause will continue to thrive.</p>

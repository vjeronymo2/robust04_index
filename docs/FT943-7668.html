			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / Arts (Openings): Edinburgh Last chance tonight at the Edinburgh Festival for dance-lovers to see Mark Morris's life-enhancing 'L'Allegro' at the Festival Theatre; Lucinda Childs and Merce Cunningham bring their companies to the Festival this week as well. There will be three performances of Peter Stein's seven-and-a-half hour production of Aeschylus's 'Oresteia' trilogy in the Murrayfield Ice Rink. Performed by a Russian cast of actors in their native language, this staging has been touring the world for several months. Other festival drama this week includes Stephane Braunschweig's production of 'A Winter's Tale', performed in French by the French National Drama Centre in Orlean; and the Abbey Theatre, Dublin, in Patrick Mason's staging of one of JM Synge's lesser-known plays, 'The Well of the Saints'.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Colorado proposed to revise Rule 3.03.2(5)(a), concerning the Division's responsibility to publish written notification of its proposed decision on a bond release request, to require that the notification include the right to request a public hearing within 60 days after the completion of the inspection and evaluation required in Rule 3.03.2(2), rather than 30 days after the completion of the inspection and evaluation or 30 days from the close of the public comment period if comments are received. Colorado proposed to delete in its entirety Rule 3.03.2(5)(b) concerning the Division's responsibility to provide written notification of its proposed decision on a bond release request within 30 days after the conclusion of an informal conference. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.40(a)(2) require a permittee to publish notice of its bond release request. The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.40(f) provide that any person with a valid legal interest has the right to file written objections to the proposed bond release and request a public hearing within 30 days after the public notice required by 30 CFR 800.40(a)(2). This Federal regulation also requires the regulatory authority to hold a public hearing within 30 days after receipt of the request for the hearing. The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.40(b)(2) require the regulatory authority to provide written notice of its final decision to release or not to release all or part of the performance bond within 60 days from the filing of the bond release application, if no public hearing provided for by 30 CFR 800.40(f) is held, or, within 30 days after such a public hearing has been held. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Unlike the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.40(b)(2), which provide that written notification of the regulatory's authority's decision must occur within 60 days of the filing of the bond release application, Colorado's proposed Rules 3.03.2(4)(c) and 3.03.2(5)(a) provide that the notification must occur within 60 days after the completion of the Division's inspection and evaluation of the reclaimed site for which bond release is sought. Since this inspection and evaluation does not occur until 30 days after the permittee's publishing of the bond release application, Colorado's proposed Rules 3.03.2(4)(c) and 3.03.2(5)(a) provide the Division with 30 more days for review than would be afforded under the Federal regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.40(b)(2) are authorized by section of 519(b) SMCRA, which requires that the regulatory authority notify the permittee in writing of its decision regarding the bond release request within 60 days from the filing of the request, or within 30 days after a public hearing on the request when one is held. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

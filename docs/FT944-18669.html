			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / Councils spar with Audit Commission on reforms District councils are in conflict with the Audit Commission over how much money can be spent in preparation for the local government review. Labour-controlled Southampton asked if it could appoint managers to plan the takeover of responsibilities after the Local Government Commission recommended it for unitary status, which would require it to take control of education and social services. But the Audit Commission's legal advice was that the council could only undertake a limited range of activities until the orders to create a new unitary council had received royal assent. It said: 'In a case like Southampton or Bristol, the present county council is responsible for education and social services. It is the county council which must collect the information about these services that will be necessary to ensure a smooth transfer of functions.' The cross-party Association of District Councils pointed out that not all the councils involved were willing to plan for new unitary councils while there was still a chance that change could be avoided. Mr John Truscott, the leader of Southampton city council, said: 'There doesn't appear to be any logic to it.' He added councils would have to work to a tight timetable next year, with orders passed by MPs in February at the earliest, and 'shadow elections' for councillors to supervise creation of the new councils in May. Southampton is a member of the English Major Cities group of district councils which is calling for the government to treat them as a 'special case'. The group also includes Bristol, Derby, Hull, Leicester, Nottingham, Plymouth, Portsmouth and Stoke-on-Trent.</p>

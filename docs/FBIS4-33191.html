			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Early Morning" newscast] </F>   [Text] Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, National Action Party  [PAN] presidential candidate, has reiterated to the media what  he has been saying all along: he will not participate in the  debate among all the presidential candidates. On 28 and 29 May,  he said the following:    [Begin Fernandez recording] I believe that if there is time  for multiple debates, it makes no sense for all of us to meet on  the same day and at the same time, especially when the objective  of the debate has already been expressed. I repeat, I think  there is enough time; it makes no sense for us to meet at the  same time and place. [end recording]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Fighting the Drug Menace"] </F>   [Text] The three bills relating to narcotics offences which  the National Assembly adopted on Monday can be taken as a  reaffirmation of the government's resolve to combat the drug  menace with renewed vigour. The new laws regularise ordinances  promulgated by the caretaker government in September last and  puts new and more powerful weapons in the hands of the  government with which to fight the evil. One of these provides  for death penalty and also the confiscation of the assets of  convicted offenders. The other two remove certain deficiencies  in the Dangerous Drugs Act of 1930. Knowing the magnitude and  complexity of the problem, the laws will be welcomed by all  those who have been demanding more stringent punishment for drug  traffickers and their minions. While doubts may be entertained  about how effective a deterrent the death penalty will be, the  provision relating to the confiscation of assets will surely be  seen as a potent measure because it is bound to have some  chastening effect on those criminals who may not be unduly  averse to the idea of being sent to prison for a year or two but  who would certainly be deterred by the thought of losing their  considerable fortunes as a punishment for their drugs-related  crimes. Doubt will nevertheless persist about the ultimate  effectiveness of these laws if they are no enforced in the same  spirit in which they have been enacted.    In deterring crime the awareness of the inexorability of the  course of law is far more important than the severity of  punishment. This is especially true in this country where most  laws are rendered impotent by a combination of corruption and  slothful enforcement. Unfortunately, this is even more true in  the case of drug-related offences in which the culprits very  often are influential people or enjoy powerful patronage through  sheer money-power and influence. The drug barons, who have  powerful links and lobbies, can dodge the law without much  difficulty. Therefore, what is of the utmost importance is the  will to strictly enforce these laws. Only the certainty of  being caught, tried and punished can instill the necessary fear  in the hearts of the offenders.    The need for a sustained and determined drive to eradicate  the drug menace is all too apparent. Over two million of  Pakistan's citizens, including women and youth, are victims of  heroin and other deadly drugs; the country's image and  reputation are being tarnished in foreign lands as a producer,  processor and supplier of different kinds of narcotic drugs.  The new and reinforced laws should give the government the  punch and power it needs to get at the purveyors of poison,  bring them to justice and break the back of their  well-entrenched operational networks. But the enforcers will  have to be careful to ensure that the powers are not applied  only against the pedlars and other small-time operators because  they can be apprehended more easily than the big fish who really  control them. If the drug barons, whose identities are not  unknown to the authorities, are allowed to go scot-free either  because of negligence or legal lacunae, the purpose of enacting  stringent laws would be frustrated.    The government would also do well to consider integrating  the  different laws, said to number about a dozen, under which drug-  related offenders can be apprehended and punished, into one  comprehensive and forceful law that would eliminate the  possibility of any offender, however influential and powerful,  evading arrest and punishment. Drug enforcement officials would  welcome such a law in place of the several which now guide their  activities and which only add to the confusion and hinder  enforcement. Of equal importance is the need to keep a strict  watch on the activities and modus operandi of the various groups  involved in the deadly trade--drug barons, carriers and pushers.  They are well-organised, have at their disposal huge wealth,  are spurred by enormous profits from relatively small  investments and have powerful links and patronage; to facilitate  their work; they cannot be restrained merely by enacting laws,  however strict. A totally different approach, backed by  scientific methods of detection, trailing, intelligence  gathering, surveillance and so on and, above all, by an  indomitable will to succeed, is what it takes to win a decisive  battle against the scourge of drugs.</p>

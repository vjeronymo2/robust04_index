			<p><P> May 29, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Japan's Major Banks Post Lower Profits: Japan's largest banks reported weaker  profits for the year ended March 31, and bank officials are predicting only a  modest recovery for the current year, which will end next March. The banks,  Sumitomo, Dai-Ichi Kangyo, Fuji, Sanwa, Bank of Tokyo and Mitsubishi Bank, said  profits fell due to the strength of the yen. The banks were also hurt by losses  from bad loans to Mexico and increases in loan-loss reserves to cover possible  defaults by debtor nations.  </P></p>

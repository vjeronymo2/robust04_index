			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Platon repeats call for no action on bid Mr Robin Meyer, chairman of Platon International, has written to shareholders of the USM-quoted instrumentation group, repeating the board's earlier advice to take no action on the bid from Wills Group. The letter follows the publication of Wills' offer document in which Mr David Massie, chairman, said there were a number of advantages of a merger, including complementary product ranges, geographic fit and opportunities for an increase in sales. He also drew attention to the recent achievements of Wills, an industrial, electronic and automotive products company. They included a return to profits, a strong balance sheet and reduced bank borrowings. They compared with Platon's recent losses, lack of dividend and qualified accounts. The 5-for-4 share offer values Platon at Pounds 2.93m, or 27 1/2 p a share. Platon's shares were unchanged at 25p yesterday while Wills' rose  1/2 p to 22p. Wills claims undertakings to accept representing 15.7 per cent of Platon. Wills also published details of its rights issue to raise Pounds 5.4m. The 34m shares are offered at 16p on the basis of 1-for-3 ordinary, 1-for-3 warrants and 10-for-3 preference.</p>

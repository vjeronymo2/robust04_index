			<p><P> September 22, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> LE CIRQUE DU SOLEIL SHINING LESS BRIGHTLY  </P> <P> Has success spoiled Le Cirque? Well, of course not, Jean-Claude.  </P> <P> Spoiled isn't the word for this French Canadian company of upscale mountebanks  who only last Sunday won, of all things, an Emmy (in a four-way tie for  Outstanding Special Event).  </P> <P> Why, the mere sight of Le Cirque du Soleil's encampment as you approach Santa  Monica Pier is a boon for smog-sore eyes. There's still nothing under the  soleil quite as enchanting as that sparkling blue and gold tent on the beach  and the palpable excitement that surrounds this magickal enterprise.  </P> <P> But an enterprise is what it has become much more in the brief span of two  years.  </P> <P> And the changes are subtle.  </P> <P> Le Cirque's founder, Guy Laliberte, for instance, is now listed as president  and CEO of Les Productions du Cirque du Soleil Inc. (the italics are ours). An  overlong preamble to the start of the show, included a welcoming address by  Laliberte that belonged in the boardroom. Saperlipopette, owners of the Loews  Hotels, a Cirque sponsor, were even introduced! The faintly acrid smell of all  that billowing dry ice -- a Cirque staple -- has become laced with a soupcon of  corporate je ne sais quoi.  </P> <P>  Aside from Le Cirque's splendid redefinition of the very idea of circus (one  ring, excellence and only human animals), marketing shrewdness and general  acumen have distinguished this Quebecois company since it took local audiences  by surprise as the spectacular opening act of the Los Angeles Festival in 1987.  </P> <P> And a lot has happened since, most of it very good for Le Cirque. But how good  is good? The show Wednesday was heavy on clowning and short one of its key  first-act attractions: the Shandong Acrobatic Troupe of the People's Republic  of China. Red tape, not politics, has allegedly delayed the troupe in China,  according to a Cirque spokesman. Amazingly -- and unforgivably -- no  announcement was made about it to the audience.  </P> <P> A lot of slapstick comedy was offered as a substitute, between ring master  James Keylon (new) and Le Cirque's resident clown Benny Le Grand, master of the  active garden hose (a return engagement of dubious hilarity).  </P> <P> It didn't quite cut the moutarde, in spite of Le Grand's soaking and smearing  of one patron and his ruining of another's necktie.  </P> <P> (Are we having fun yet? . . .)  </P> <P> Le Cirque's real strengths lie elsewhere: in the superiority of their specialty  acts (the superb young jugglers, gymnasts, cyclists, trapeze artists,  aerialists and contortionists) and Le Cirque's exceptional, extraterrestrial  special effects; the resplendent, rainbow-hued costuming by Michel Crete and  Dominique Lemieux; the fantasy lighting by Luc Lafortune, and Rene Dupere's  striking original music, under the adroit musical direction of Benoit Jutras.  </P> <P> While the second half of the evening was considerably livelier than the first,  there were still not as many breathtaking acts as one remembered from past  incarnations. True, the French trapezistes are terrific (despite a couple of  well-recovered fumbles), but no better than the trapezistes of 1987. Bulgarian  acrobatic dancers Maia Taskova and Mariela Spasova do nice things with  streamers and hoops and balls, and Frederic Zipperlin's contortionist juggling  (with spheres of all sizes) is admirable, but not nearly as amazing as the  contortions of Angela Laurier in Le Cirque's 1988 visit. These new acts'  overall level of competence appears down a notch from the company's formerly  uncontested A+ level.  </P> <P> All in all, it is the older routines that continue to dazzle most: gymnasts  Eric Varelas and Amelie Demay; the daredevil cyclists, the balancing chairs,  the teeterboard act of the "businessmen penguins."  </P> <P> The fruit of too much success? Perhaps. Or is it simply that when Gilles Ste.  Croix replaced Guy Caron as artistic director the sensibilities changed? That's  more likely. But it's all remediable, and the arrival of the Shandong Acrobats  on Tuesday will probably do much to relieve this malaise.  </P> <P> Le Cirque is still a remarkable entertainment. It's just that we all know by  now how remarkable it can be and won't settle for less. So cut the comedy and  get on with the acts, because this time you walk out humming the scenery,  lights and, naturellement, the music.  </P> <P> Good but not good enough.  </P> <P>  Under the big top on the beach at the Santa Monica Pier, Tuesdays through  Thursdays, 8 p.m.; Fridays, 9:30 p.m.; Saturdays, 4:30 and 8:30 p.m.; Sundays,  1 and 4:30 p.m. Through Oct. 15. Tickets: $7.50-$31.50; (213) 458-6199, (213)  480-3232 or (714) 740-2000.  </P> <P> </P></p>

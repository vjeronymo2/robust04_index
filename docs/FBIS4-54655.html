			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Message by His Majesty King Mihai I to the Homeland on </F> Holy Easter 1994" -- date not given]    [Text] Romanians:    Today, when you are celebrating the Holy Easter Holidays,  together with your families in your villages or in your towns, I  am addressing you in earnest.    I decided to accept the invitation of the Metropolitan of  Banat and of the Mayor of Timisoara to come to our Romanian land  and pray together for our homeland.    In spite of their promises, those who are ruling today do  not  allow me to be together with you where I had been invited, that  is in Timisoara. They have not succeeded in overcoming the fear  of those direct ties that exist between you and me, ties whose  signs became evident two years ago when hundreds of you welcomed  me with enthusiasm.    The authorities are wrong. For all of you and for them, too,  my presence among you represents the guarantee of civil and  moral peace, as well as the spiritual peace that the Homeland  needs in order to emerge from self-doubt, discouragement, and  fear. Having confidence in what was said at the first talks  that started two weeks ago on practical aspects of my journey, I  hoped that the authorities finally understood that my only  preoccupation is to make a contribution, with all my power, to  the reconciliation of all Romanians, because only together can  we revive Romania.    Although I was ready to take into consideration all  solutions  in the name of the major interest of all Romanians and national  unity, in spite of the wish showed by some people who are  involved in administering the Homeland's affairs, I have to  notice with sorrow that the highest level of the state  leadership still upholds the unjust decision regarding my  exclusion, a decision taken by the leaders of the communist  state coup over 40 years ago.    Romanians, because of you and for you, I do not want to lose  hope. The Lord's resurrection is the triumph of hope over  suspicion and we share the same belief in the triumph of life  over death.    Christ has arisen!    This is the time when our patience has to yield results.  Christ has arisen!    The time has come for those who suffered injustice to rise  and move on. We say the same prayer for our Homeland, for your  families, and for your future.    Christ has arisen!    Romanians, my destiny is in your hands. My return depends on  each of you, by respecting the freedom and dignity of each  person.    I know that many of you have publicly shown the wish to see  me among you and I was greatly moved listening to the appeals of  the representatives of the nation, of young people, of  intellectuals, of trade unions, and of numerous associations.  To all this one can add the thousands of letters that I receive  from faithful fellow nationals.    The time has come for us, after sacrifices and suffering, to  be together at the revival of our homeland.    On behalf of my family, I wish you happy holidays.    So help us God!    Mihai</p>

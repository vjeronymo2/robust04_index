			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / Parliament and Politics: Borrie points to 'disarray' - Takeover &amp; Merger Policy IT IS TOO EARLY to judge the success or failure of the government's policy on UK acquisitions by foreign state-controlled companies, Sir Gordon Borrie, the Director-General of Fair Trading said yesterday. Sir Gordon told the Commons Trade and Industry Committee investigation on takeovers and mergers, however, that following the clearance by the Monopolies and Mergers' Commission of the Pounds 300m acquisition by Elf Aquitaine, the French state-controlled oil group, of the UK downstream assets of Amoco last week, the so-called 'Lilley doctrine' was 'in some disarray.' Sir Gordon said since last July there had been a number of mergers which qualified for referral to the MMC under the new policy. In six cases, Mr Lilley had accepted the director-general's advice not to refer. In three cases, Credit Lyonnais-Woodchester, Signet-Sligos and Elf Aquitaine-Amoco, he had not taken the director-general's advice. In two other cases, Kemira Oy-ICI and British Aerospace-Thomson CSF, there were issues of competition involved which required investigation. In the light of the MMC's clearance of four of these five mergers, Mr Lilley would no doubt want to review his policy, Sir Gordon suggested. It would be wrong for the director-general to stretch his independence to include any matter which he personally thought should be referred, Sir Gordon said.</p>

			<p><P> August 6, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC;  </P> <P> 2 SOLOISTS DISTINCTIVE AT PEPPERDINE FESTIVAL  </P> <P> The Malibu Strawberry Creek Music Festival wheeled around into its orchestral  phase Saturday night at Pepperdine University's cozy Smothers Theatre.  </P> <P> Until this midway point, the five-concert series had been preoccupied with  chamber music -- a medium more suited to the dry, intimate Smothers acoustics  than big-thinking orchestral classics. Nevertheless, Yehuda Gilad and the  mid-sized Festival Orchestra served up a trio of orchestral works planned  around no less lofty a theme than last November's fall of the Berlin Wall.  </P> <P> And yes, there was distinction to be heard -- mostly from the two guest  soloists, New York Philharmonic concertmaster Glenn Dicterow and cellist Peter  Rejto, in the Brahms Double Concerto for Violin, Cello and Orchestra. Dicterow  was virtually faultless, brandishing a gleaming, marvelously agile, world-class  tone that blended beautifully with Rejto's less secure, but mostly smooth,  suave cello. It was a true collaboration, with neither player dominating.  </P> <P> For his part, Gilad was content mostly to push straightforwardly ahead while  giving his soloists plenty of room to sing. Had the performance taken place in  a more reverberant hall, it might have had an even more powerful impact.  </P> <P> Beethoven's Symphony No. 8 opened with a cautious, somewhat broadly paced  movement and sported lean, clear textures everywhere. As the piece wore on,  Gilad eventually was able to produce some essential sharp-edged rhythm from his  generally tight ensemble, though he couldn't do much about the frequently sour  intonation of the violins.  </P> <P> Before the Brahms and Beethoven, Gilad offered a rarity -- the first seven of  Max Bruch's 15 "Swedish Dances." The portion heard here revealed a rather  earnest attempt to emulate Brahms' own "Hungarian Dances," one that never quite  lets its hair down despite a few dashing moments.  </P> <P> The program booklet, by the way, couldn't make up its mind as to whether the  Brahms Double Concerto was written in A minor or C. The former is correct.  RICHARD S. GINELL  </P></p>

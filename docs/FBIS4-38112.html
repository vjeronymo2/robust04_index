			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by 'Abd-al-Rahman Isma'il] </F>   [Text] The negotiations between the government and the IMF  have reached a dead end. The IMF insists that the government  devalue the Egyptian pound and offer a large number of public  sector companies for sale in exchange for its recommending that  one-third of Egypt's debts be waived; that is, $4 billion, which  are scheduled to be forgiven this month under the agreement  signed between the government and the IMF in the summer of 1991.    The talks held last week between government officials and a  team from the World Bank were fraught with acute differences, as  each side stuck to its position. The government asked the World  Bank team to postpone the devaluation of the pound to a later  stage and promised in return to accelerate the privatization  process and sell a considerable number of public sector  companies in the coming months.    Zafin Burmister [name as transliterated], World Bank  representative in Cairo, has stated at a ceremony marking the  bank's 50th anniversary that the government has pledged to the  bank to privatize more than 80 public companies in the coming  months. He added that the government is keen on fully  implementing the program signed with the bank and the IMF to  have a third of its debts forgiven.    Mahmud 'Abd-al-'Aziz, chairman of the Banks' Union, has  stated that banks will stop accepting any new deposits as a  result of the increase in the deposits they now hold. He added:  Unless the government hastens to issue long-term bonds enabling  the banks to invest the accumulating funds in their possession,  the banks will find themselves compelled to stop accepting new  deposits. Speaking to journalists during a seminar on Arab  banking on Sunday [19 June], 'Abd-al-'Aziz explained that the  banks will not accept money it cannot invest. The increase in  deposits held by the banks, he added, will lead to a drop in the  interest rates.</p>

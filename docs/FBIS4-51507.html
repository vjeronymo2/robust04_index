			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by commentator Naoki Tanaka: "Japan's Involvement </F> in Security of East Asia and Deregulation"]    [Text] As with the Hosokawa government in the past, the  Hata government will have to develop an interim character since  the relationship between individual politicians and voters has  yet to be established regarding specific policies. People  inside and outside the government are expected to make brisk  moves towards a parliamentary majority. How then should voters  respond to the interim government? There is no other way but to  establish a concrete criteria for judging whether the interim  government is acceptable, taking Japan's world position into  consideration. My criteria for such judgment is based on the  following two points.    First, Japan should be involved in East Asian security.  Japan should continue to study how to dissuade North Korea from  developing nuclear weapons and how to specifically apply  Japan-U.S. security arrangements to the East Asian situation on  the premise that Japan takes such initiatives within the  framework of the Constitution. The Diet should clarify Japanese  involvement in the use of U.S. military bases and supply depots  in Japan.    Nuclear weapons must be loathed. If the democratic system  proves its solidity in blocking North Korea from developing  nuclear weapons, this would create a dramatic condition for the  security of East Asia. It goes without saying that blocking  North Korea from developing nuclear weapons would clear up  unfounded concerns over a rise of militarism in Japan.    Second, Japan should create a climate for expanding private  investment by abolishing economic regulations. The abolishment  of such economic regulations will inevitably spark fierce  competition among enterprises, and some will suffer defeat.  However, goods and services provided by competitive enterprises  will greatly benefit consumers and users. This logic has never  been tested.    Abolishing government regulations will turn the public  sector  around. But will the Hata government take the lead in  abolishing such regulations?    The aforementioned points are my criteria for assessing the  Hata government.</p>

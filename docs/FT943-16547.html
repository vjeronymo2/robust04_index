			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Leading Article: Swedish bond boycott The sharp rise in European bond yields this year partly reflects investors' nervousness about deteriorating public finances around the industrialised world. In few countries does such concern look more justified than Sweden. The three-year-old centre-right coalition of Mr Carl Bildt has presided over an explosive build-up of public debt. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, gross general government debt will rise to 93 per cent of gross domestic product this year against only 44 per cent in 1990. The public deficit, which reached 13 per cent of GDP last year, is now falling slowly as the economy starts to grow after three years of contraction. The most worrying feature is the rise in the structural deficit. According to the OECD, this is only about three percentage points below the actual deficit, partly reflecting large government outlays on the crisis-hit banking industry. The Bildt government has been woefully unsuccessful in reducing government spending, estimated this year at 67 per cent of GDP, against 59 per cent in 1990. Whichever government emerges from the September general election will need to make expenditure cuts a priority. Against this sobering background, Friday's statement by Mr Bjorn Wolrath, chief executive of the Skandia insurance group, that it is stopping purchases of government bonds looks understandable, yet curious: understandable, because Mr Wolrath appears to be alarmed by the prospect that the opposition Social Democrats, if victorious in September, could prove even less adept than Mr Bildt in curbing the deficit; curious, because Mr Wolrath must have known his comments would trigger a sharp fall in Swedish bond prices and the krona. The Skandia group, which holds an estimated 4 per cent of Swedish state debt, has thus suffered a large capital loss on its domestic bond portfolio. Mr Bildt reacted by pointing to the continuing need for deficit cuts and implied that the Social Democrats were not up to the task. This may seem an inadequate response, but the Bildt government has already unveiled plans to prune spending by the equivalent of 10 per cent of GDP over the next five years. The debt imbroglio highlights a Swedish paradox. Sweden's plans to join the European Union are predicated on its becoming a 'core' country capable of taking part in economic and monetary union. However, Mr Bildt's measures to improve the functioning of the economy have left the country far away from the Maastricht convergence targets. Over the longer term, Mr Wolrath's broadside should strengthen politicians' will to implement budget cuts. In the short term, however, the Skandia statement will make Swedish bonds difficult to sell, unless real interest rates rise further and the krona falls. Yet these would merely be palliatives. Sweden's integration into Europe demands urgent pruning of public spending and the fiscal deficit.</p>

			<p><P> July 19, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POLAND EXPECTED TO ELECT JARUZELSKI;  </P> <P> HE DECIDES TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT; ASSEMBLY VOTES TODAY  </P> <P> Communist Party leader Wojciech Jaruzelski said Tuesday that he will be a  candidate for the newly created office of president, virtually assuring his  election today by the National Assembly.  </P> <P> Gen. Jaruzelski, 66, a career military officer, thus reversed his announcement  of June 30 that he was withdrawing from the running. He cited "new facts" and  "a sense of duty" as impelling him to stand for the presidency.  </P> <P> Among the factors that caused his change of mind, Jaruzelski said, was "the  need for the preservation of continuity of the functioning of the state and  concern expressed for its stability."  </P> <P> "International aspects were strongly emphasized," he went on. "It was commonly  stressed that avoidance of responsibility in such a special moment would be in  contradiction to the duties of a politician and a soldier."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'New Facts'  </P> <P> Among the "new facts" was a slow collapse of resistance to Jaruzelski's  candidacy among Communist Party allies in the National Assembly. In recent  days, the Peasants' Party and the Central Committee of the Democratic Party  came out in support of the general after nearly two weeks of waffling.  </P> <P> The Communists and their allies have 300 of the 559 votes in the two-house  National Assembly and should be able to elect Jaruzelski without help from the  259 members of Solidarity, the independent trade union movement.  </P> <P> The Communists won Solidarity's agreement to have an open roll-call vote on the  presidency in order to ensure party discipline. It was not certain whether  Solidarity will instruct some its members to vote for Jaruzelski if the vote is  close, but last week, Solidarity leader Lech Walesa -- in a surprise public  statement -- said he was willing to work with Jaruzelski if he were elected.  </P> <P> "It is not the habit of parliamentary democracy that an opposition votes in the  same way as the government majority," Solidarity Sen. Karol Modzelewski said.  However, Solidarity members could help Jaruzelski simply by not taking part in  the voting, thereby reducing the needed majority.  </P> <P> Jaruzelski, when he announced his withdrawal, endorsed his interior minister,  Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak, for the post, and he suggested again Tuesday that the  National Assembly turn to Kiszczak if his own candidacy should fail.  </P> <P> Kiszczak, however, has generated little enthusiasm in the Communist Party  ranks, although Solidarity initially preferred him and Walesa actually endorsed  him. Kiszczak had led the government side in the so-called round-table  negotiations that led to Solidarity's return to the political arena.  </P> <P> After Jaruzelski's withdrawal, it became evident that the Communist Party saw  Jaruzelski as a stabilizing force and as far more trustworthy than Kiszczak,  whose genial demeanor with Walesa and the Solidarity leadership suggested  weakness to a party faced with an uncertain future.  </P> <P> Over the past week, Jaruzelski met in closed sessions with each party  organization, concluding Monday with a six-hour session with the Solidarity  members of the National Assembly.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cool Response  </P> <P> The Solidarity members, by and large, responded coolly to Jaruzelski, noting  that he had failed to repudiate his 1981 declaration of martial law or Poland's  participation in the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion that put down the "Prague  Spring" reform movement in Czechoslovakia.  </P> <P> Jaruzelski and his supporters in the party believe that the declaration of  martial law, at the height of the Solidarity crisis, saved Poland from Soviet  military intervention.  </P> <P> Under the recently rewritten Polish constitution, the president may serve two  six-year terms and will control Poland's military and foreign relations -- thus  assuring, in the current situation, Poland's continued close relations with the  Soviet Union. Presumably, this is what Jaruzelski meant by his reference to the  "international aspects" guiding his decision.  </P> <P> The president's first order of business will be to appoint a prime minister,  who will put together a government. The task is assuming growing urgency as the  nation's economic situation appears to be worsening steadily. The annual  inflation rate is now estimated at 160%, and shortages are chronic.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Threat of Unrest  </P> <P> Meanwhile, bus and tram drivers in Katowice, a heavily populated industrial  area in south-central Poland, went on strike Tuesday demanding higher pay.  </P> <P> The threat of renewed labor unrest is troubling to both Solidarity and the  government, which has dealt with recent wage demands by quickly increasing  wages and then printing more money.  </P> <P> The government has temporarily frozen wages and prices, mostly in an effort to  curb a series of small wildcat strikes that began to sweep Poland in April and  May. But the government has indicated that prices will soon be increased  sharply.  </P> <P> Although no one is certain how the militant Polish labor force will respond,  there is concern that a serious outbreak of labor unrest could threaten the  first power-sharing arrangement in the East Bloc.  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 28, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> HAWAII;  </P> <P> 4 MORE HOUSES LOST TO VOLCANO'S LAVA  </P> <P> Lava slowly flowing from Kilauea Volcano through a remote housing area on the  island of Hawaii sent four more houses up in flames.  </P> <P> Civil Defense officials put the number of homes destroyed in Kalapana Gardens  since April 4 at 32, or about a quarter of the subdivision's homes. Two  separate flows were joining together, and the lava surges caused Civil Defense  officials to extend blockades and to warn residents of the possibility of large  methane gas explosions. Hawaii County Civil Defense Administrator Harry Kim  warned residents that the town's one store and two churches could be destroyed  in the next week to 10 days.  </P></p>

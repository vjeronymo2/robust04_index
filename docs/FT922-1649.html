			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: WPP As a rule companies do not like seeing their accounts qualified by the auditors. But WPP may be an exception. Arthur Andersen's stark observation yesterday that a going concern basis may cease to be appropriate usefully underlines the urgency of agreeing terms for the marketing services group's capital reconstruction. It has long been clear that WPP was heading for a mid-year crunch, precipitated by a combination of subdued cash flow from trading, earnout payments to executives of acquired businesses and interest and debt repayment deadlines. Not for the first time in the history of once high-flying UK stocks, though, a group of preference shareholders is attempting to extract a better deal. Armed with a clear majority of the votes - and gambling that the banks will not dare pull the plug when the money runs out next month - they are hoping to do better than the present draft offer, which requires them to convert their holdings into ordinary shares at four times the normal rate. It looks like a dangerous and greedy game. The ordinary shareholders, to be sure, are in a weak position with the pref holders enfranchised. But the further they are diluted the weaker the incentive for those WPP executives on whom a recovery in the company's fortunes ultimately depends. Nor are the existing terms exactly miserly, when compared with say the Brent Walker or Brown &amp; Jackson schemes. Allowing for future earnouts, pref holders will control a bigger slice of the cake than they would under the original conversion, a cake which will be increased by the banks' Pounds 150m debt-for-equity swap. In the absence of a Saatchi-style put option, the banks appear to have the whip hand. The effective preference offer of 35.3p per share compares with an average price over the last four months of 28.7p. With bank debt trading at 65 per cent of its nominal value, it would not do for the pref holders to push their luck.</p>

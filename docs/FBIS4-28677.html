			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["United States Must Clearly Know the Will of the Korean </F> People" -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, June 12 (KCNA) -- The U.S. House of  Representatives reportedly passed on Thursday a "resolution"  urging "sanctions" against the DPRK.    This is entirely unreasonable. This is a wanton violation of  the sovereignty and dignity of our Republic and an unpardonable  strong-arm act to stifle our socialism.    The U.S. House of Representatives also carried a  "resolution"  urging the readjustment of the schedule of the "Team Spirit"  joint military manoeuvres this year and "strengthening of the  combat power" of the South Korean puppet army. This revealed  again the sinister intention of the United States to contain the  DPRK by force of arms.    This can be easily judged from the facts that Robert  Gallucci, U.S. assistant secretary of state, blared that "the  United States does not rule out military sanctions against North  Korea" in a hearing at the subcommittee of Asian and Pacific  affairs of the U.S. House of Representatives on the 9th of June  and Hamilton, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the  U.S. House of Representatives, next day said the U.S. had no  other option but to fight and that it was necessary to increase  the potentials of the U.S. troops in South Korea and the puppet  armed forces.    If the United States chooses a reckless adventure, ignoring  our repeated warnings, we will take a decisive self-defensive  measure.    The United States must clearly see our unshakable will and  resolution and immediately stop the adventurous war provocation  moves.</p>

			<p><P> May 7, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> FALSE READINGS ON COCAINE USE  </P> <P> People who receive a common local anesthetic may test positive for illegal  cocaine use up to two days after treatment, doctors at Fairfax Hospital in  Falls Church, Va., warned last week. They said that applying half a teaspoon of  tetracaine, Adrenalin and cocaine solution, called TAC, to the skin for local  anesthesia before stitching up a cut or wound will produce a positive urine  test for cocaine for up to 48 hours.  </P> <P> Similar effects can occur when the topical cocaine solution is used before  surgery on the eye or nose, as well as for certain dental procedures, the  doctors reported in Annals of Emergency Medicine.  </P> <P> One day after receiving TAC, more than three-quarters of the 18 patients in the  study "clearly failed" a standard test used to screen people for illegal drug  use, said Dr. Michael Altieri, who directed the study.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kiev, 13 Dec -- Ukrainian Peasants Democratic Party  [USDP] cochairman Serhiy Plachynda said: ``As we expected,  communist fascism in Russia is winning. It is subsidized by  both world Zionism and chauvinist circles. Those who may come  to power in Russia will pursue a policy which will be very  dangerous for Ukraine. It is now becoming clear that the public  should reach the conclusion that we must not disarm. Nuclear  missiles are a guarantor of peace not only in Ukraine but  throughout the world. Zhirinovskiy will be at war with Ukraine  the moment the last ballistic missile equipped with a nuclear  warhead is removed from Ukrainian territory. It is a great  danger to Ukraine that President Kravchuk does not realize that  nuclear weapons are a guarantor of statehood and security. Our  government and structures of power are operating a pro-Moscow  policy: Even now Ukraine is buying goods from Russia paying six  times as much [as we should] and selling them for eight times  less [than we should]. Ukraine's budget is plummeting and all  that is aggravated by such a dangerous force appearing as  Russian communist fascism. So the USDP position is that, as a  nuclear state, we can only carry out nuclear disarmament when it  is adequately matched by other nuclear states' disarmament.''</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Andrey Bayduzhiy, under rubric "News" and </F> subrubric "Carte Blanche": "Forget About the Ecology?: Clean Air  as Payment for Economic Survival"]    [Text] Not too long ago the pages of NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA  were the arena for heated polemics between Viktor  Danilov-Danilyan, minister of environmental protection and  natural resources, and Aleksey Yablokov, chairman of the  Interdepartmental Commission (MVK) for Ecology, of the Security  Council. If one discards the mutual personal dislike that is  typical of Russian administrators, the essence of the  differences of opinion expressed by the two respected ecologists  and ex officio state figures can be summarized as  opposing evaluations of the state of the natural environment --  which is almost apocalyptic, according to Yablokov, or one that  suggests restrained optimism, according to Danilov-Danilyan.  Accusing each other of incompetency, the learned gentlemen, who  indisputably occupy, in today's ecological table of ranks, the  first and second places (I shall not undertake to make a  judgment about who occupies which place), cite extremely weighty  arguments as the basis of their positions. And it would scarcely  be worthwhile for a journalist to interfere in this almost  scientific discussion if it had not revealed an underlying  natural law that it would be a mistake to ignore. Despite all  the difference of the views expressed by the administrators of  Minprirody [Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural  Resources] and the MVK, they completely coincided in the view  that the resources available to their departments and, in  particular, the executive power's vertical line in general for  resolving or at least mollifying the ecological problems are  obviously inadequate, and that new steps are necessary here.    Being consistent individuals, neither one delayed in putting  his words into action. Viktor Danilov-Danilyan, as a member of  Russia's Choice, continued his march into power and, intending  to achieve the development of civilized environmental-protection  legislation, added to the title of minister the rank of deputy  to the State Duma. Aleksey Yablokov, on the contrary, declared  politics to be an unworthy matter and, as a sign of protest  against President Boris Yeltsin's ignoring of ecological  problems, submitted his resignation from the position of his  advisor on ecology and the protection of health, while reserving  the right, even after leaving the MVK, to concentrate completely  on the creation of a broad ecological movement.    The opposing nature of the actions taken by people who  possess in Russia ecological power to the highest degree only  seems to be such. Actually it attests to a situation when a few  ecologists, professionals and amateurs, have been completely  deprived of public attention and support, while remaining  one-on-one with numerous problems. The hopes shared by the  optimists, among whom Danilov-Danilyan himself was included,  that, after the upsurge of the ecological movement in the second  half of the 1980's and its damping as a result of the economic  and political crises in the early 1990's, the population that  had adapted to the new realities of the democratic market would  turn its gaze to the mess in the ecology, were not justified.  The results of the recent election serve as the best  confirmation of this. The "Green" party, which united the  activists of the ecological organizations, having failed to  collect the necessary 100,000 signatures, came crashing down as  early as the registration stage. The Cedar bloc, which made  statements under ecological slogans, despite an intensified  advertising campaign, suffered as a result a no less impressive  defeat and, with 0.1 percent of the votes, ended up in last  place. Incidentally, as for Cedar, whose voter list included  just about anyone, so long as he was not an ecologist, that  movement, which had been created shortly before the beginning of  the election campaign, did not recommend itself by anything in  particular, other than tinsel advertising posters with elements  of ecology, and, after its defeat, went back into the  underground, presumably until the next election.    Such a crushing defeat for the ecological bloc cannot be  explained simply by its fractionation or lack of organization.  Both situations, of course, exist, although one of the leaders  of the Socioecological Union, enraged at an item published in  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on the eve of the election, did attempt to  prove otherwise, ascribing to his movement nonexistent merits  and accusing the press of doing no more and no less than  unleashing an informational war against the "Greens." However,  even the small size of the ecological organizations -- which lay  as the basis of these shortcomings -- actually only reflects  another, much more serious tendency. Its essence lies in the  fact that the chief antiecological center, that previously used  to be located somewhere at the summit of the  party-nomenklatura-departmental pyramid, has today  shifted sharply downward, and the person who acts as the  ecologists' chief opponent is no longer the state official, the  director corps, or the "new Russian" businessman who is chasing  profit at any cost, but actually that very same  average-statistical Russian man in the street who, not too long  ago, demanded the closing of practically all the dirty  production entities and the establishment of strict ecological  order.    According to Minprirody data that was cited in the summer of  1993, the precise following of the already enacted laws and  statutes governing the protection of the environment would lead  at that moment to the bankruptcy of more than 60 percent of the  Russian enterprises. A year later, the economic crisis has  definitely not loosened its embraces, and today the number of  enterprises that guarantee their survival, including those doing  so thanks to the ruthless exploitation of nature, is even  greater. They can be made ecologically safe only by investing  tremendous amounts of money in environmental-protection  measures, which, either as a result of an increase in cost, will  convert their output into something that is completely  uncompetitive not only in the world market, but also in the  domestic market, or will force the compensating of the  environmental-protection costs at the expense of people's wages.  Either of these situations will have an immediate negative  effect on the population's standard of living. That is why the  ecological slogans that previously seemed to be a reflection of  man's legal right to have a normal environment, are evaluated  today by the same population as green extremism.    Incidentally, one should not think that the problem of the  price of ecology is pertinent only for Russia. A few years ago  in Germany, a country that is ecologically favorable as compared  with us, in response to a compliment concerning rabbits that  were running across the lawns, the burgher who was giving me a  ride only slapped the pocket in which his wallet was presumably  located and, with a rather sour face, said that he would gladly  trade all the rabbits for a new BMW. But whereas the West  Europeans who have achieved a certain level of prosperity have  to pay for the preservation of a normal living environment by  rejecting a part of their welfare in the form of a second car or  a country home, for Russians, 60 millions of whom live in areas  with unfavorable ecological conditions, the alternative is much  harsher. The smog that hangs over the city and the growing  figures in the disease rate seem a much lesser evil than the  much more tangible threat of unemployment, poverty, and fuel  crisis.    As a result, the resolution of the most painful  environmental-protection questions, with increasing frequency,  comes up against not the inactivity of the executive authority,  an economic depression, or imperfect legislation, but the  population's elementary unwillingness to sacrifice anything at  all for the sake of the ecology. There are more than enough  examples of this: from the small Karelian settlement of  Nadvoitsy, the residents of which, in exchange for their  economic welfare, have reconciled themselves to ecological  misfortunes, to the cities around the Caspian, where the local  authorities took the money that had been allocated to combat  flooding and diverted it to other purposes.</p>

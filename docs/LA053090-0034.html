			<p><P> May 30, 1990, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> IT'S NO FAST-LANE LIFE, BUT 200 TURTLES KEEP OJAI COUPLE ON THE GO  </P> <P> On a warm afternoon in the Ojai Valley, 77-year-old Lillian Greene is busy  outside her home making the daily head count of her turtles.  </P> <P> There are about 200.  </P> <P> Her husband, Max, 85, is about to make his daily trip to what he jokingly calls  the "big wicked city" of Ojai to pick up the vegetable cuttings that Bayless  Market saves for him.  </P> <P> The tortoises eat a diet made up primarily of lettuce, oranges, mangoes, corn  on the cob, grape leaves and frozen string beans, but they also love cactus and  wild mustard from the fields.  </P> <P> "Grass is better for them than lettuce," says Lillian as she smashes apples  with a heavy rock for two huge Sulcata tortoises from the Sahara, with shells  nearly two feet across.  </P> <P> Though toothless, the large turtles chomp through the apples in seconds. Their  razor-sharp jaws are so strong that during battle they can rip through an enemy  tortoise's shell and flip it over on its back.  </P> <P> "I don't dare turn my back on them or they'll butt me," Lillian said. Some  tortoises are extremely aggressive and will butt anyone on their territory.  Lillian bought this pair, but the majority of their turtles were gifts.  </P> <P> The Greenes' property, blooming with purple and yellow climbing roses and blue  rosemary, resounds with grass-chomping and scraping of shells against obstacles  as the tortoises crawl slowly around.  </P> <P> Surprisingly, they are not silent: Lillian says they make sounds like a baby  doll or a jackhammer when excited or during mating.  </P> <P> Many of the tortoises or turtles (the terms are used here interchangeably,  although technically tortoise designates the terrestrial varieties and turtle  the aquatic) at the Greenes' Turtletown are grandparents and are up to 100  years old.  </P> <P> It is an international mix of Mojave tortoises, Hermanns from England and  Germany, tiny Israeli Terrestras, box turtles, little Horsefield turtles from  the steppes of Russia and more.  </P> <P> There are numerous sheds with cardboard cartons that serve as the tortoises'  beds, a small "gingerbread" cottage and low "houses" of cinder-block, boards  and blankets. Constantly underfoot, the turtles have free reign under the shade  of large patio umbrellas and mesh awnings.  </P> <P> "We get up each day at 7 to open everything up," Lillian Greene said. They then  feed, doctor and clean up after the tortoises. After lunch, school classes or  curious visitors often line up for tours.  </P> <P> The Greenes put the tortoises away for the night by 4 p.m., boarding up the  small huts to keep out raccoons and the bear that once menaced their brood.  </P> <P> The Greenes moved to the Ojai Valley in 1930 as newlyweds and still live in the  same house. About 20 years ago, they heard something eating their squash. It  turned out to be a tortoise attached to a large chain and ring, which they  promptly removed.  </P> <P> Unable to find its owner, the Greenes adopted Speedy; someone gave them a  female, and nature took over. People started bringing them sick, injured or  lost tortoises and eventually the animal shelters brought them more, Lillian  Greene said.  </P> <P> Now they have a permit to care for turtles from the California Department of  Fish and Game that they proudly display with their awards from the Desert  Tortoise Council, the Optimist Club and the Ventura County Humane Society.  </P></p>

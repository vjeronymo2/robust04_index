			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, April 5 (CTK) -- The participation of  Juraj Molnar, a delegate by the Slovak National Party (SNS) in  Sunday's World Slavonic Congress, held on the initiative of  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, is evidence of a crisis in the party,  chairman of the Democratic Left Party (SDL) Peter Weiss told  journalists today. This crisis results in pushing for extremist  and populist trends, Weiss added.    "If a political party loses a program, it usually  compensates  it by turning to myths. One of them could be Slav solidarity  and cooperation of Slav countries," Weiss said.    Chairman of the ethnic Hungarian Christian Democrats Bela  Bugar pointed to the apparent shift in the SNS strategy. The  party's last electoral manifesto was unique [in] calling for the  destruction of a common state of two Slav nations; now it is  calling for the unification of the Slavs, Bugar argued.    Slovak Radio broadcast a statement by SNS chairman Jan Slota  today. Molnar travelled to Moscow as an observer and was not  assigned to present a message, Slota said.    Slota considers negative statements by leaders of other  parties inadequate and stupid. At the congress Molnar said  "five sentences" on the need of Slav solidarity, concluding that  no Slavs would exist without Great Russia. Slota said he fully  identified himself with this view.    The SNS "has nothing in common" with the alleged invitation  to Zhirinovskiy to Slovakia for April 16-19, Slota stated,  adding that "if we are really such a democratic country as we  are calling ourselves... I see no reason for wondering about  Zhirinovskiy's visit".</p>

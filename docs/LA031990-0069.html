			<p><P> March 19, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Video Deal: The image of the home-video business as a dog-eat-dog jungle full  of combative companies is changing.  </P> <P> An unprecedented instance of cooperation between two of the biggest companies  -- Paramount and Warner -- was announced recently. They're jointly financing a  30-second TV ad promoting sales of Paramount's "Indiana Jones and the Last  Crusade" and Warner's "Lethal Weapon 2" -- both available at $24.98. The  commercial, now in 17 markets, features clips from both action films. Both  movies have been in the top three on Billboard's rental chart for the last few  weeks. CLAUDIA PUIG  </P></p>

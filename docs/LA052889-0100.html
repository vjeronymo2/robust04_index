			<p><P> May 28, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Cardinal John J. O'Connor of New York arrived in Beirut on a three-day mission  to draw attention to foreign hostages held in Lebanon and to the bitter  fighting there. The 69-year-old archbishop is scheduled to meet with warring  Christian and Muslim leaders on both sides of the divided capital. O'Connor is  in Lebanon in his capacity as president of the Catholic Near East Assn., which  provides millions of dollars in humanitarian aid to the embattled country. He  said he would gladly meet with any of the nine Americans and seven other  Western hostages, and added, "I hope that they can hear my voice or can see me  or can read that the people of our country have not forgotten them."  </P></p>

			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Time to try harder on pensions Sir, In connection with the government white paper on pensions ('Pensions - the white paper', June 24), dare one pose two questions? 1) Is the Treasury happy that social security secretary Mr Peter Lilley's white paper (specifically on the minimum solvency standard) could have the effect of depressing UK equity stocks for years to come, while being able to write new government debt without fear of political reprisals for decades? 2) Is the actuarial profession so despicably greedy for fatter fees that it has to devise age specific asset/liability solvency standards? It is time to knock a few heads together (or off). Encouraging governments to issue more gilts is, I contend, not a socially responsible policy. Although actuaries are the best equipped to measure risk, their ability for getting it wrong for UK plc is plain to see. One example is the unnecessary pension surplus built up in the 1980s as a result of assumptions that were too conservative and damaged corporate UK recovery from the early 1950s recessions. Why should they take away the fairly basic commercial decision from trustees, who can come to their own conclusions on what risk profile to adopt, including actuarial advice? Any minimum solvency standard would not have stopped Robert Maxwell; it merely places an extra burden on employees' and employers' purses and the only gainers are the actuaries, benefit consultants and the government's borrowing requirement. Thank you, Mr Lilley: now please try harder. C R Kemp, Caparo House, Birchills, Walsall, West Midlands WS2 8QE</p>

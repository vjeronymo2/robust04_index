			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Vietnamese Must Leave the Country"] </F>   [Text] The 350 Vietnamese asylum-seekers who fled to the  Netherlands from Czechoslovakia a few years ago have until the  end of the year to leave the country. If they don't go, they  will be repatriated to Vietnam.    Tomorrow in Hanoi, the Netherlands and Vietnam are to sign  an  agreement determining the procedures for the return of this  group, Foreign Minister Kooijmans told the Second Chamber. Some  350 people are involved. Vietnam has agreed not to persecute  them on their return. That was the condition required by the  Second Chamber before it would approve the agreement. The  Justice Ministry has given the refugees six months to leave the  country of their own accord, after which time they will be  forcibly expelled.    Asylum-seekers who return to Vietnam of their own accord can  count on assistance from the International Organization of  Migration and from UNICEF, the UN refugee organization. The  group in question are Vietnamese who worked as contract workers  in Czechoslovakia before fleeing to the Netherlands following  the "velvet" revolution, for fear of discrimination. A total of  500 Vietnamese came to the Netherlands, about 150 of whom have  since voluntarily returned to Prague or Vietnam.    The Netherlands did not want to recognize them as refugees  as  Justice Minister Kosto did not believe there were any grounds  for doing so. The Second Chamber found return to Vietnam  undesirable as long as the Vietnamese Government had not  guaranteed they would not be persecuted.</p>

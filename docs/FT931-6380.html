			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Councils map for Wales to be redrawn THE MAP of local government in Wales is to be redrawn for the second time in 19 years. Mr David Hunt, Welsh secretary, yesterday announced his intention to replace the eight counties and 37 districts with 21 unitary authorities responsible for all services. Elections for the new councils will be held next year and the authorities will come into being legally on April 1 1995. Making the announcement - appropriately on St David's day - Mr Hunt said the 'desirable reform' would give electors a 'better understanding of who is providing local services, which will result in greater accountability'. The reshaping of local councils brings to an end two years of talks. A similar reorganisation is being discussed in Scotland and in England, where the Boundaries Commission is not likely to report for some time. Mr David Thomas, chairman of the Council of Welsh Districts, said the reform would give Wales 'a system of government that can for the first time be clearly understood by the people it serves'. The Assembly of Welsh Counties, which had lobbied against diminishing county powers, made no statement. Under Mr Hunt's proposals, county names such as Clwyd, Dyfed, Gwent and Gwynedd - introduced by a Conservative government in 1974 - will disappear. Names then wiped off the local-government map, such as Monmouthshire, Pembrokeshire, Carmarthenshire and Cardiganshire, will re-appear along with new districts such as Heads of the Valleys in south Wales. The reform will affect 120,000 workers though the districts. Mr Thomas did not think more than 1,000 - 'all in central administration' - would lose their jobs. A report last month by management consultants Touche Ross put the cost of the re-organisation ranging from as little as Pounds 66m over 15 years to as much as Pounds 153m at constant prices. Touche Ross also projected potential savings from a minimum of Pounds 17m a year, and Mr Hunt said he was 'confident the reorganisation will pay for itself well within 15 years'. The Welsh capital, to be known in future as the City and County of Cardiff, is to be given a special role. A study is to be undertaken of how the city, and its position as capital, should develop over the next 25 years. Mr Hunt told MPs Wales would lead the UK out of the recession. Announcing a five-year programme for the regeneration of the valley communities, he insisted the portents were good for the whole of Wales to 'go for growth'. The Welsh secretary also looked to the new local government structure based on a single tier of 21 unitary authorities to secure a more co-ordinated approach to economic issues through the Welsh Economic Council. He emphasised that Wales had established itself internationally as the 'first option for new projects and expansion'. Assurances by Mr Hunt that the reform of local government was unlikely to lead to massive redundancies failed to satisfy Mr Ron Davies, the shadow Welsh secretary, who said the high level of unemployment was 'blighting the economy of Wales'. Mr Hunt emphasised the success of the first five-year programme for the valleys, due to end on March 31, in bringing to bear the full range of government policies on the problems and challenges of a single area. He said the creation of long-term sustainable employment of improved quality should be the first objective.</p>

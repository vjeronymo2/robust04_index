			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / International Company News: CarnaudMetalbox improves 15% CARNAUDMETALBOX, the French packaging company whose 25.3 per cent shareholder MB-Caradon, the UK building products and security printing group, is considering selling its stake, increased net profits by 15 per cent to FFr976m (Dollars 174m) in 1992. That was in spite of tough trading conditions and the effect of devaluations against the franc. Mr Jurgen Hintz, president and chief executive officer, said the results showed that CMB was recession-resistant. He said that even without any recovery in its markets in 1993, the group should show further progress. There were gains to come from cutting costs, saving working capital and using FFr1.5bn of tax losses. Mr Ernest-Antoine Seilliere, head of CGIP, the Frech holding company which has a 25.3 per cent stake in CMB, said if MB-Caradon sells, CGIP aims to buy 7 per cent and an associate investor would buy a further 6 per cent. The Paris stock exchange had said this would not necessitate a full bid. Sales in 1992 fell 3 per cent to FFr 24.8bn, but would have been 2 per cent ahead on constant exchange rates. Lower resin prices hit prices for plastic packaging but margins in the division improved pushing the group operating margin up from 9.4 per cent to 9.9 per cent. Operating profits rose 2 per cent to FFr 2.5bn. Lower reorganisation costs of FFr262m compared with FFr389m and a fall in interest charges to FFr 642m from FFr 672m led to a 12 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to FFr 1.7bn. Earnings per share were FFr 12.07 up 14 per cent. A dividend of FFr4 is proposed, an 8 per cent rise.</p>

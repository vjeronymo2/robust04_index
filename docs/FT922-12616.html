			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / World Stock Markets: Shopping around in a global retailing sector - Investors who are increasingly seeing signs of new life in pan-European retailers INVESTING IN European retailing stocks has primarily been determined by national considerations with investors backing companies in countries where economic growth and consumer spending promise to be the most buoyant. The German retail sector has been a prime example of the phenomenon as investors bid up retail stocks to take advantage of the strong consumer sales and growth opportunities created by unification. The German stores sector was lifted to a rating of 30 times earnings in 1990 but has since slipped back to 17 times in 1992 as the Bundesbank applied a squeeze on interest rates to get inflation back under control. The retail component of stock markets in several other European countries has also fallen back as consumer spending expectations for 1992 have remained generally bleak. But there appears to be a growing belief that consumer spending should pick up markedly in the second half of this year and many retail stocks are twitching back to life. However, as retailers slowly internationalise their businesses, such simple national economic determinants are becoming increasingly obsolete. Many of the bigger European retailers have invested heavily outside their domestic markets, broadening their exposure to growth in other countries and continents. For example, many French food retailers have sought to escape the constraints of their dire home market by investing abroad. Carrefour now derives 40 per cent of profits from hypermarket operations in Spain, Argentina, Brazil, the US and Taiwan, while Promodes made 45 per cent of its profits in 1990 from stores in Italy, Portugal, Spain and the US. A study by UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the London-based stockbroker, found that 22 of the 37 big quoted continental European retailers had some foreign earnings - almost 18 per cent of their profits outside their domestic markets. Although this international exposure is considerably less than in most other industrial sectors, some individual retailers, such as Delhaize Le Lion of Belgium, and Ahold of the Netherlands, now derive more than half their income from their stores in the US. At an international retailing conference held by Goldman Sachs at the start of April, Mr Tom Smith, chief executive officer of the successful Food Lion grocery chain, which is partly owned by Delhaize, outlined an ambitious expansion strategy, promising to open 125 stores this year. Food Lion's rapid expansion has largely been responsible for Delhaize's profits growth, which has been constrained in Belgium by the mature retailing market and restrictive planning laws. Partly as a result of these developments, many investors, particularly the American and Japanese fund managers, are already viewing retailing stocks on a pan-European basis. And as the single market develops and national economies converge, there will increasingly be a case for investing in individual retailing stocks rather than national sectors. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew believes that two groups of European retailing stocks offer attractive prospects: German retailers, which will benefit from the upsurge of consumer spending in the eastern Lander; and the geographically diversified retailers, such as Carrefour, Promodes, Delhaize and Ahold, which are well positioned to sustain good international profits growth in spite of saturated home markets.</p>

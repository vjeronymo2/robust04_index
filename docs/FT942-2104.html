			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Vodafone valuation Sir, Re Lex's comment on the relative valuation of Cellnet and Vodafone (Securicor, June 13). The valuation would be more comparable if it took account of two important factors. First, the differing levels of debt in the companies; Vodafone has more than Pounds 100m of net cash while Cellnet has several hundred million pounds of capitalised finance leases. Second, unlike Cellnet, Vodafone has substantial international investments which could be worth Pounds 1bn. If these factors are taken into account Cellnet would be valued at 65 per cent of Vodafone's UK operations, rather than 45 per cent contained in Lex. The higher percentage seems a more reasonable level; as Lex pointed out, Vodafone has double Cellnet's cash flow and operating profit.

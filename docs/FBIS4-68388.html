			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Irina Zvyagelskaya, vice president of </F> the Russian Center for Strategic and International Studies:  "Russia's Diplomatic Style in the Middle East"]    [Text] The visits to Moscow by PLO Chairman Yasir  Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin testify not only  to the possibility of new steps toward settlement of  Palestinian-Israeli relations and the Arab-Israeli conflict as a  whole, but also to Russia's choice of a new line of action in  the Middle Eastern area.    Russia inherited the role of cosponsor of the Middle East  conference from the disintegrated USSR. It was inherited under  conditions where Russia, running up against economic hardships,  not possessing the military potential of the former great power,  and having received numerous conflicts in the former Soviet  republics, was scarcely able to permit itself to follow an  active policy in a region which was sinking ever lower on the  scale of foreign political priorities.    As a result a very strange situation emerged: formally  Russia  had certain obligations resulting from its status and related to  settlement of the conflict, but at the same time it had  practically no approaches of its own to the problem. Russian  policy was realized within the framework of a kind of "Siamese  twins" notion, spoken of by minister of foreign affairs A.  Kozyrev in an interview with KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA on 9 April  1994. This merging with the American position (not only in ends,  which was justified, but also as to means) undermined the  traditional influence of Russia in the Middle East. The  willingness to transfer all the worries of a settlement to the  United States, which really did have great capabilities, in no  way fit with the obvious fact that Russian interests in the  Middle East are not identical with American interests, although  they can coincide in part.    Let me recall in this connection the role of the USSR in the  period of the Iraqi aggression against Kuwait. Soviet diplomacy  of that time supported the U.N. Security Council decisions that  envisioned stopping aggression, using military force against  Iraq (if it did not withdraw its troops), establishment of the  embargo, and so on, but still it operated with its own means.  The USSR even resorted to a certain worsening of relations with  the United States, which unequivocally favored military force,  but it kept its image of a power with its own political  personality and view of the situation.    The merging with American policy deprived Russia of those  advantages which it could have drawn from the ideological  reorientation. It is well-known that many Arab regimes who  viewed the spread of communism as a direct threat to their  existence were inclined to development of closer relations with  Russia, which had rejected communism as its official ideology.  The Middle Eastern scheme of international relations has always  been built on balance. The cessation of the "cold war" and  removal of the region from the sphere of the Soviet-American  standoff, which were received favorably in the Middle East, did  not mean that the states located there were ready to accept, in  place of the two rival forces, some ugly and unnatural hybrid  which would deprive them of the freedom of political maneuver.  Notions of undivided U.S. dominance became widespread in the  Middle East, replacing the former bipolar structure.    Russian participation in settlement of the conflict remained  a formality and this made it more difficult to work out the  system of its own interests in the Middle East and their  relationship with other foreign policy priorities. A pause in  determination of national interests was probably inevitable  because Russia had entered a role that was new to it as an  independent subject of international relations. It could not  help preserving a certain genetic link with the former great  power, of which it was a fragment. The duality lying in the very  history of the appearance of contemporary Russia in the  international arena was reflected in all its political behavior.  The natural desire to occupy a worthy place in the world was  extinguished by fears that it would be accused of a rebirth of  imperial ideas inherited from the USSR. Moreover, the internal  political ratio of forces (the predominance of advocates of a  complete rejection of the old Soviet policy) led to distortions.  Unjustified hostility to any U. S. actions was replaced with  equally unjustified "Siamese twinning."    Succession and new elements of foreign policy were most  closely intertwined for Russia in the question of a Middle East  settlement. The USSR, whose peace initiatives were by no means  always realistic and often were mere words, consistently called  for an international conference on the Middle East and for  participation by the Palestine Liberation Organization in the  peace talks. It took significant changes in the international  and regional arenas (the Palestinian uprising in the occupied  territories, the crisis in the Persian Gulf, and Egypt's  intermediary role) to bring these appeals to practical  realization. The Madrid process, which began in October 1991,  opened the doors to both multilateral and bilateral talks among  participants in the conflict. The coming to power of government  of the Avoda [translation unknown] socialist party reordered the  focuses in Middle East settlement. Emotions gave way to greater  pragmatism.    In the system of talks Russia was an honorary cochairman,  able to approve agreements that were reached but unable to do  anything significant to prepare them or put them into effect.  The Palestinians and Israel began to conduct their own game,  calling on the United States when necessary and seeming to  forget about Russia's existence. This was demonstrated in the  Oslo meeting in August 1993 where the PLO and Israel agreed to  institute autonomy in Gaza and Jericho, and in September 1993 in  Washington where they signed the agreement. By itself the  agreement, with all its unquestioned importance, could not  signify a smooth transition to Palestinian self-government.  Bloody tragedies continued and continue to be played out in the  occupied territories. The crime in Hebron where an Israeli  settler shot praying Palestinians in a mosque put the whole  peace process in danger.    In this situation Russia has a special responsibility. The  Middle East, which for it has become the "far" abroad, still  preserves its special strategic, political, and economic  significance. After the events in Hebron Russian diplomacy was  able, using its ties with the PLO and the current level of  relations with Israel, to prevent a breakoff of the talks. V.  Posuvalyuk, a special representative of the RF President, was  sent to the Middle East, followed by deputy minister of foreign  affairs Yu. Ivanov and minister A. Kozyrev himself. Talks  between the Palestinians and Israel were renewed in Cairo. The  visits of Arafat and Rabin to Moscow will obviously help  consolidate what has been achieved and, despite all the  difficulties, strengthen mutual understanding.    At the same time Russo-Syrian and Russo-Jordanian contacts,  an important element in the settlement, have broadened.    The talks are continuing in essentially the "Washington  format." Russia's activism, including its proposal to call a  second Madrid conference, did not arouse enthusiasm in  Washington. It is not just a matter of different approaches to  settlement. The steps by Russian diplomacy were perceived in  Washington, which has already begun to become accustomed to  close partnership, as an affirmation of Russia's desire to  distance itself from American policy and receive political  dividends for its own initiatives.    In actuality a normal process is underway. Russia is  developing its own diplomatic style in the Middle East, trying  to introduce a contribution that fits its national interests  into the resolution of this protracted conflict.</p>

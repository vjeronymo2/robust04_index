			<p><P> October 2, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> AUSSIE TO GET SUPERSONICS TRYOUT  </P> <P> Andrew Gaze, who led Seton Hall to the NCAA final this year, left Australia for  a tryout with the Seattle SuperSonics.  </P> <P> If the 24-year-old Gaze can make the Seattle lineup, the 6-foot-7 forward would  become the first Australian to play in the National Basketball Assn.  </P> <P> "I don't know what I am up against or how it will go, but I'll just give it my  best shot," Gaze said.  </P> <P> "I might be cut off after two weeks, I might be able to stay on. It's a new  challenge and it will be a great experience."  </P></p>

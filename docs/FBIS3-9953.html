			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with former Minister of Social Security Antonio </F> Britto by Artur Pereira; place and date not given]    [Text] Atlantida, Rio Grande do Sul--Identified in a recent  poll as the PMDB's [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party]  favorite candidate for president of Brazil, former Minister of  Social Security Antonio Britto insists he is going to run for  governor of Rio Grande do Sul State. Now recovered from surgery  to repair a hernia, Britto is relaxing at the beach resort of  Atlantida and using the time to receive an average of 50 people  a day, mostly delegates from the state branch of the PMDB. Walks  along the beach are gradually being replaced by long phone  conversations in which he tries to round up support for the  party's nomination. "The only reason I would not run for  governor is if the party denies me the nomination," he said.    The decision to run in a regional election, in his opinion,  puts him in an especially good position to discuss the future of  his party, now weakened by charges of corruption against quite a  few of its stalwarts. Britto's prescription is simple: "The PMDB  candidate must be a familiar face. It must be a clean face." To  the former minister, politicians today can no longer equivocate  when it comes to ethical and moral issues.    These subtle criticisms are aimed at a specific target:  former Sao Paulo Governor Orestes Quercia. In an interview with  O GLOBO, Quercia had made a rather unflattering assessment of  Antonio Britto the politician, accusing him of being too  inexperienced to run for the presidency. The response came in  the form of cruel irony: "I do not want to write any page today  that I would have to explain tomorrow," Britto said,  emphatically, after begging "Dr. Quercia's" pardon for having  too short a resume for his 41 years.    In informal conversations with friends and advisors, Antonio  Britto gives other reasons for turning down the nomination to  run for president under the PMDB banner. He would not feel  comfortable working the crowds in the company of colleagues  whose images are tarnished--some by charges of corruption,  others by woeful performances in regional posts. Britto thinks  this would jeopardize the good ratings he has achieved in the  polls. That is why he urges a far-reaching purge in the PMDB,  with the proviso that the accused be guaranteed every  opportunity to defend themselves. "The way it is on the campaign  trail today, the PMDB has to stop at every corner to give  explanations," he lamented.    Although he turned down the invitation to serve as the  government's new leader in the Chamber, the former minister  vigorously defends his friend Itamar Franco. Orestes Quercia's  harsh criticisms of the government and the president do not  please Britto. He credits the Itamar government with reinstating  ethics and dignity in the federal public administration of this  country.    The former minister's isolation in the southern coastal  resort is only relative. Early in the morning Britto receives  telephoned reports from his advisors about stories in the day's  newspapers in central Brazil. Starting last Thursday, he began a  program of visits to nearby towns, as part of his campaign for  governor of the state.    [Pereira] A survey taken in the PMDB indicates that you are  preferred by 35 percent of respondents, compared with 10 percent  for Orestes Quercia. Does that encourage you to run for  president?    [Antonio Britto] Obviously, I am flattered by the results of  those polls. However, they cannot make me change a decision that  is irreversible: my decision to run for governor of Rio Grande  do Sul.    [Pereira] Deputy, you have not only the PMDB survey in your  favor. You are also well situated in the public opinion polls.  Wouldn't that make you change course and run for Planalto Palace?    [Antonio Britto] I have been interpreting those opinion  polls  primarily as a judgment of my accomplishments at the Ministry of  Social Security. So I am happy when I see those figures, but a  candidate for the presidency--and it seems to me Dr. Collor  taught us that--is not viable unless there is a lot of solidity  in his platform and among his supporters.    [Pereira] What kind of problems would prevent an agreement  prior to October's presidential election?    [Antonio Britto] The parties are looking at the national  picture through the lens of parochial interests. So the PSDB  [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] looks at the polls, sees that  it is strong in Sao Paulo, and bases its approach on that. The  PMDB does the same thing, and so on.    [Pereira] But isn't there a contradiction there? By opting  to  run for governor of Rio Grande do Sul, aren't you showing  greater concern for regional matters than the problems of this  country?    [Antonio Britto] It is not a matter of putting either one  first. It is a matter of having a concern that, naturally, is  national--to win a more appropriate role for Rio Grande do Sul.    [Pereira] Do you think the atmosphere is favorable to the  emergence of an alliance at the center to oppose Lula and Maluf?    [Antonio Britto] I think it is only a matter of time before  we see an understanding between the labor-oriented and social  democratic sectors. It could happen today, if people would take  the larger view. But if it does not happen today, it will happen  tomorrow out of necessity. God willing, the necessity will not  be too great and the price paid for the delay not too high. I do  not know whether the country can stand yet another process that  is formally legitimized by democracy but made illegitimate by  administrative failure. What we do not know is whether the  country will continue to put up with a situation where people  are told to renew their hopes through the ballot box, but later  their frustration is renewed because of the administrative  actions they witness.    [Pereira] In light of this danger of a repeat of  frustration,  don't you think this is a good time for politicians to put aside  their personal interests?    [Antonio Britto] What scares me is realizing that someone is  going to be elected president. He will bear an extraordinary  burden of hope, but also a dose of voter impatience that was not  present in the wake of previous elections.    [Pereira] Former PMDB president Orestes Quercia said the  country is leaderless. Would you agree?    [Antonio Britto] Obviously not. President Itamar inherited  the worst situation in the history of the Republic: empty  coffers, a disbelieving public, and a wrecked state. Despite all  those difficulties, his performance will be measured by the fact  that the next president will find the country in better shape  than Itamar found it. Furthermore, we must credit him for  reimposing ethics and dignity in the federal administration. So  the presidential hopefuls should be the first to support Itamar.    [Pereira] What would you say is the purpose of those  criticisms?    [Antonio Britto] I do not have to judge Dr. Quercia's  intentions. I judge the effect of what he said, and the effect  is not positive for this country. It is very easy today to take  positions based on "I have nothing to do with that."    [Pereira] In the case of the PMDB, is this happening because  of internal disputes?    [Antonio Britto] In the past, the PMDB's prestige was the  result of a common position taken by the majority. Now we have  neither the personal prestige represented by [the late] Tancredo  [Neves] and Ulysses [Guimaraes], nor the programmatic prestige.  The PMDB today is a confederation whose components talk to each  other through the newspapers. What motivates people to stay in  the PMDB is the belief that in political party life, you don't  solve the problem by changing the name of the shop or its window  display.    [Pereira] Former Governor Orestes Quercia said you have  neither the background nor the experience to run for the  presidency. What is your reaction?    [Antonio Britto] I should beg Dr. Quercia's pardon because,  at 41, I have only able to become a federal deputy, a minister,  and--above all--to earn a degree of respect that touches me  greatly, that inspires me, i.e., the respect of my fellow  citizens. Perhaps my delay in building a longer resume is due to  the fact that I am very careful. I do not want to write any page  today that I would have to explain, or regret, tomorrow.    [Pereira] You and Senator Pedro Simon head the so-called  "authentic" group within the PMDB. Is that group disposed to  face up to the fight and compete against Quercia at the party  convention?    [Antonio Britto] There is no fight at all. What Senator  Simon, I, and the majority of the party members have said is  something extremely simple. This country has improved a lot in  these past months because two principles without which there can  be no nation have been rediscovered in Brazil: solidarity, and  dignity. You can choose to be a parliamentarist,  presidentialist, republican, monarchist, social democrat,  socialist, or capitalist, but you cannot choose a country where  there is no dignity or solidarity. What we have been saying is  that in this improved country, neither the PMDB nor any other  party can even begin to present itself to society if it does not  offer alternatives that are characterized from the outset by  dignity. The face of the PMDB candidate must be a clean face.    [Pereira] Does this mean the PMDB will have trouble during  the presidential campaign because it harbors some of the  so-called "dwarfs" from the Budget Committee and people accused  of corruption, as is the case with former Governor Orestes  Quercia?    [Antonio Britto] I do not think people can equivocate any  longer on issues involving the ethical conduct of public  figures. As for the colleagues who have been touched by the  charges, the correct road would seem to me to be assuring ample  opportunity for defense and total support so they can defend  themselves. If it is proven that they are involved, the party  can no longer live with them.    [Pereira] But how can you patch together a unity that  involves leaders who have been tarnished by accusations of  corruption or poor administration?    [Antonio Britto] Brazil is nostalgic for the old MDB  [Brazilian Democratic Movement] and we in the PMDB miss it, too.  Particularly since during the MDB era, the party's strength was  that it could work the crowds and be considered by the  man-in-the street as an instrument of Brazilian society that  could bring about a sensible change in the social democratic  line. Dr. Ulysses used to say--and he repeated it in that  historical speech of his when he resigned as president of the  PMDB--that "politics is either practiced in the streets, or not  practiced at all." Going out into the streets will become  possible for the PMDB if it understands some of the requisites  put there by society as, for example, the need for dignity. This  means the PMDB must undertake a renewal of its cadres.    [Pereira] So you do not think the PMDB is ready for the  campaign trail today?    [Antonio Britto] Right now the PMDB in many states is  uncomfortable about going into the streets and having to stop at  every corner to give explanations. That is why we urge that  Pedro Simon be named party president, since he has the best  resume within the PMDB. He would be able to lead the process of  renovation and purge. But I think that even if Simon is not  party president, the future of the PMDB will continue to depend  greatly on him. The party has a preliminary question to answer  within the next few weeks: whether it wants to be a participant  or just a spectator in the election process. If it is content to  be a spectator, fine, then it has nothing to worry about. It can  just keep doing what it is doing. If it wants to compete, then  it has to change.    [Pereira] In light of this confused party situation, do you  think Lula would be elected if the voting took place today?    [Antonio Britto] No. If Lula could be considered today as  president-elect, he would not be stuck down there at 28 or 29  percent. I think Lula has a biography that must be respected,  but he has not yet faced the realities of the campaign. The  campaign has not begun yet. Actually, so far the PT [Workers  Party] is the only party that has not been of help to Lula. The  rest seem--because of omission, confusion, or division--to have  been working for Lula.    [Pereira] Were Lula to win the election, do you think he  could forge the agreements that would guarantee his ability to  govern?    [Antonio Britto] The biggest problem Lula faces is that fact  that many people in the PT go to bed dreaming of Felipe Gonzalez  but wake up next to Fidel Castro. The PT seems to me to be  suffering from very serious doubts about the role it should  play--a modern and progressive role that seeks alliances with  social democratic sectors to build a majority, or the opposite.  That can work only if the platform is a minority plan imposed on  a majority. Both the future of the PT as a party and that of  Lula depend on the answer to that question.    [Pereira] Might the indecisiveness of that parties give rise  to another savior of the Fernando Collor type?    [Antonio Britto] I think that despite the suffering, the  Collor era did us some favors. One is that it put an end to  these candidates who come out of nowhere and, worse, whom no one  knows where they are going. I do not think there will be  anything new in the election context in terms of names.  Novelties, if any, will be found in formulas, agreements, and  coalitions.    [Pereira] If it turns out that the parties cannot agree on a  candidate through a so-called "third route" and if former  Governor Orestes Quercia wins at the PMDB convention, would you  stand on the same platform with him?    [Antonio Britto] In the first place, I would be afraid of  spoiling Dr. Quercia's platform appearances because of my lack  of experience (chuckles). But obviously, I do not think there is  any way for Dr. Quercia to become a candidate until the  explanations he was asked to provide become a solid reality. I  think he himself is acting correctly by beginning to take steps,  that certainly have not been completed, in terms of providing  the explanations that the public is demanding.    [Pereira] You were defeated in the mayoral election by  Olivio  Dutra, of the PT. Isn't there a risk that this will happen  again, in the race for governor?    [Antonio Britto] Dutra is the one who should be worried,  since he once ran for governor and lost. In politics, no one  wins every time.    [Pereira] Deputy, it seems you are a little pessimistic as  regards this country's future, given the indecisiveness that you  yourself mentioned.    [Antonio Britto] I am not pessimistic. What I am is  perturbed  because what I see is a country that is poised on the brink of  growth, a country that has already identified and located its  problems. And yet, strangely, things are not moving forward.  There is just one reason for this: we have not yet been able to  build the kind of political will that can support a plan for  change.</p>

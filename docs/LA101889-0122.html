			<p><P> October 18, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ALISO VIEJO;  </P> <P> TAX RATE INCREASE TO FINANCE SCHOOLS  </P> <P> A tax to help pay for new schools in the Aliso Viejo community and a portion of  Mission Viejo will be included in property tax bills for the area starting next  year.  </P> <P> The tax rate, set by the trustees of the Capistrano Unified School District  this week, will range from $241 for a single-family, detached home less than  1,700 square feet, to $483 for a home between 2,400 and 3,499 square feet.  Apartment owners will pay $145 per unit, and owners of commercial and  industrial property will pay $1,725 per net acre.  </P> <P> The tax rate will be re-evaluated by school trustees on July 1 of each year and  may be raised a maximum of 2% per year. The special tax district was  established two years ago in an agreement between the school district and the  Mission Viejo Co., said Dave Doomey, a school district administrator.  </P> <P> The agreement allows the district to sell $120 million in school bonds to help  pay for a high school, an intermediate school and four elementary schools in  Aliso Viejo. A fifth elementary site will be purchased in Mission Viejo near  Felipe Road and Barbadanes.  </P> <P> The first bond will be sold for $45 million and paid off by residents over 25  years. Additional 25-year bonds will be sold as the additional schools are  needed, Doomey said.  </P> <P> During the first tax year, 3,349 residential units and 165 parcels of  commercial acreage will be assessed the school tax, according to Doomey.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali by </F> Asiem el Difraoui; place and date not given: "Finger on the  Trigger"]    [Text] [Difraoui] Mr. Secretary General, what is your  view on NATO's Bosnia ultimatum?    [Butrus-Ghali] Of course, we welcome the decision of 9  February. In fact, the United Nations acted as a kind of  catalyst with its letter to Manfred Woerner. We confronted NATO  with its responsibility and thus contributed to their new  determined position.    [Difraoui] Who will decide on air strikes when the ultimatum  has expired: NATO or the United Nations?    [Butrus-Ghali] First of all, we hope it will not get that  far and negotiations will lead to heavy weapons being handed  over to the blue helmets before the ultimatum expires. The  United Nations and NATO are cooperating closely. Who will give  the "all clear" for possible air strikes has not been determined.    [Difraoui] If you are allowed to do so, will you start air  strikes?    [Butrus-Ghali] I would not hesitate one moment to enforce  the Security Council's decisions by means of air strikes. If  NATO gives me a mandate, I can act immediately because I already  have a UN mandate.    [Difraoui] Could air strikes fail because of Russian  opposition?    [Butrus-Ghali] Certain members of the Security Council, such  as the Russian Federation, have their own interpretation of  certain security resolutions, as far as the difference between  air support and air strikes is concerned. They consider these  two things as completely separate. But at the moment, the  Russian Federation shares the same aims as the United States,  the European Union [EU], and the United Nations, and it plays an  active role in the Geneva talks.    [Difraoui] Would not a lifting of sanctions have been more  effective than the threat of air strikes?    [Butrus-Ghali] Lifting the embargo is a decision that the  Security Council has to take. So far, the Security Council has  rejected doing this.    [Difraoui] In your capacity as Secretary General -- are you  tending toward lifting the embargo?    [Butrus-Ghali] My position has various nuances. I will  follow the Security Council's decision. I think that the  Security Council has to accept responsibility for such a  decision.    [Difraoui] In view of the continuing massacres, there are  numerous voices in the world that advocate a tougher approach....    [Butrus-Ghali] I can understand the worldwide feeling of  dismay. I am suffering as well, I am alarmed by the massacres,  the genocide, the rapes. I am shocked. Nevertheless, public  emotions have to be restrained in order to be able to go on  negotiating.    [Difraoui] Has the United Nations been able to determine yet  who is to blame for the massacre in the Sarajevo market?    [Butrus-Ghali] No, we are still investigating.  Paradoxically, these investigations are very difficult because  there was only one shell involved and not several. If there are  more than one explosion, it is easier to determine where the  shells come from.    [Difraoui] In your opinion, who is mainly responsible for  the continuation of the war?    [Butrus-Ghali] This is a difficult question. We are all  responsible, of course there are the warring parties, but also  those who did not want to intervene. As far back as last May,  the Security Council demanded 8,000 blue helmets for Bosnia. We  (the General Secretariat) asked for 30,000 troops. So far, we  have not even gotten the 8,000. Of course, the continuation of  the war is mainly the fault of the warring parties, who are  sisters and brothers really -- but it is also the fault of the  international community. It does not make the necessary efforts  to find a solution. There are not enough funds being made  available.    [Difraoui] Several UN generals in former Yugoslavia, such as  Francis Briquemont and Jean Cot, criticized exactly that. They  blamed the United Nations for not providing enough troops -- and  this is why they had to go.    [Butrus-Ghali] I can understand their standpoint. But the  United Nations does not have any troops of its own. It is the  member states that supply the United Nations with troops. We  kept asking, we sent letters to dozens of countries. We did not  get anything. It is, therefore, not our fault. The United  Nations has fulfilled its task and has established contact with  the member states, but it did not get a single soldier....    [Difraoui] Is this not a situation where everybody is  blaming everybody else -- the United Nations is blaming the  member countries, and the member countries are blaming the  United Nations?    [Butrus-Ghali] No, I do not think so. We have always  demanded troops and additional material to carry out our task  properly. We need a maximum number of troops in order to  achieve maximum results. But still, we will not blame the  countries that have not sent any troops. There are 124 member  countries, and you cannot blame them all -- but the United  Nations is being blamed.    [Difraoui] Where did the United Nations make mistakes?  Where are you blaming yourself?    [Butrus-Ghali] The only thing for which we can blame  ourselves is that we have not managed to convince the member  states of the necessity of having more troops there. That we  have not managed to convince them to pay their contributions.  We are in a bad financial crisis -- $1 billion are outstanding.    [Difraoui] Is this not also due to mismanagement and  corruption within the UN administration?    [Butrus-Ghali] Various newspapers keep reporting gigantic  failures within our administration. This is an exaggeration. I  have nominated an inspector to fight corruption; as soon as  problems become obvious, sanctions will be taken. On the  subject of mismanagement: One has to remember that with the  same administration, the same number of people, we are no longer  carrying out three, but 17 international peacekeeping missions.  We have not taken on one single additional person. We have  troops in Burundi, Rwanda, observers in South Africa, soldiers  in Cambodia, Somalia, a military presence in the Spanish Sahara,  in El Salvador.... The fact that we manage to do all this  speaks for itself. Cambodia was a particular success. The  United Nations managed to create stable conditions for free and  fair elections. Yasushi Akashi, the United Nations' special  envoy in Cambodia is now in charge for former Yugoslavia.    [Difraoui] Does this mean you feel unfairly treated by  world opinion?    [Butrus-Ghali] To put it simply, public opinion looks for a  scapegoat and blames the United Nations. I would not say that  we do not make any mistakes. But the mistakes arise from our  being inundated with work. At the same time, we do not have  either the military or the logistic means to carry out 22  operations. This is our weakness. We have the funds for three,  four missions, but not for 22.    [Difraoui] After a long debate, Germany is now finally  deploying blue helmets -- not for military missions, but for  humanitarian and logistical support. Should the Federal  Republic not provide combat forces?    [Butrus-Ghali] No!!! -- What counts for me is that Germany  takes part in UN activities at all. It is up to the individual  member country to choose which field it is most interested in.  Peacekeeping missions are only 30 percent of all UN missions;  70 percent are environmental measures, economic and social  cooperation, development aid, etc. There is a lot to be done  every week.    [Difraoui] This means there will be no Bundeswehr bombers  over former Yugoslavia?    [Butrus-Ghali] Our policy is that every country can decide  itself what it wants to offer. We accept anything. One state  could say: We are prepared to send aircraft, another one sends a  hospital. A third: We are going to send troops, but only under  the condition that they do not fight.    [Difraoui] If you had the opportunity to do so, how would  you change the composition of the Security Council, which goes  back to the times of the Cold War?    [Butrus-Ghali] I would not make any suggestions, but I would  think practically: Who pays, who sends people....    [Difraoui] Germany pays almost one-twelfth of the  contributions. Would not Germany have the right, if not to a  seat on the Security Council, at least to house some of the  important UN organizations? The United Nations promised this  indirectly on several occasions?    [Butrus-Ghali] Yes, I was in Bonn for this reason, and we  will transfer several UN organizations there. But I would also  like to say that it is more important to have many German  engineers within UN organizations worldwide than to have the  headquarters of these organizations in Germany.    [Difraoui] But if the Germans would like to have more of the  United Nations in their country....    [Butrus-Ghali] We have achieved this. During the next few  months we will transfer a division of the UNDP, that is the UN  development aid program, to Bonn.    [Difraoui] But this is not an important organization....    [Butrus-Ghali] You have to start making small steps.    [Difraoui] Do you intend moving a human rights organization  to Germany in the future?    [Butrus-Ghali] We can talk about that when such an  organization is established.... I will come to Bonn during the  next few months. I would like the Germans to take an even more  active part in UN activities. I am counting on Germany's role  in the world to strengthen the United Nations' role. As I said  before, this does not only mean peacekeeping missions, this is  just one activity. There is a summit on social development going  on in Copenhagen; there will be a summit on overpopulation in  Cairo next year; in 1995 Beijing will host a summit on women.  These are examples for important contributions and  technological help of a country like Germany....    [Difraoui] Are you content with the situation in Somalia?    [Butrus-Ghali] After the withdrawal of the Belgian, French,  U.S., and German troops we are trying to do our best, replacing  them with African and Asian units.    [Difraoui] Is this not a failure?    [Butrus-Ghali] No. Of course, we have not been successful  in the south of Mogadishu. But in the entire rest of the  country, and this is 95 percent, we were successful. We have  established local police forces, local councils, hospitals,  orphanages, etc.; food supply is safeguarded, children no longer  die of hunger.... These are very positive things.    [Difraoui] The only peace talks that brought about concrete  results last year were those between Israel and the PLO. The  United Nations did not have a share in these -- is this not  typical?    [Butrus-Ghali] No, there is no text of the United Nations  that says that the United Nations holds a monopoly on conflict  solving. On the contrary, I would be very pleased if the  Israeli-Palestinian conflict were solved tomorrow outside the  framework of the United Nations. I would also be content if the  conflicts in Burundi or Rwanda were solved by the Organization  of African Unity. As I said, I am overburdened. I do not have  the means to care for 22 sick persons, if I have only beds for  three or four available. If anybody else wants to solve a  conflict, I am the first person who will be pleased about it.    [Difraoui] During the Gulf war the idea of a new world order  was emphasized. Was this not a big illusion?    [Butrus-Ghali] I have never said that there is a world  order, not to speak of a new one. The only thing I said was  that a new world order must be established -- and that the  United Nations can help develop it.</p>

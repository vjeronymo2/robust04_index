			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Congressional and Administration concern about the adverse effect of discriminatory ``reverse preferences'' on U.S. commerce has been rekindled by recent complaints about ``reverse preferences'' that are allegedly granted to imports from the European Union (EU) by some agreements between the EU and countries in Central and Eastern Europe. Therefore, as provided in the SAA that accompanies the UR Act, the Administration intends to conduct a full review of ``reverse preferences'' that may be granted by beneficiaries of the GSP program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> II. GSP Review <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The SAA provides that, upon enactment, USTR will initiate a GSP review to determine whether any GSP beneficiary grants preferential treatment to imports from another developed country that has, or is likely to have, an adverse effect on U.S. commerce. This review will consider ``reverse preferences'' granted by any GSP beneficiary, but it is expected to focus principally, although not exclusively, on countries in Central and Eastern Europe that have association agreements with the EU. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> USTR is directed to solicit public comments and to seek information from U.S. Embassies in GSP beneficiary countries. Ninety days thereafter, USTR will determine whether the ``reverse preferences'' granted by a GSP beneficiary have or may have an adverse effect on U.S. export interests sufficient to warrant further review. If so, USTR will enter into bilateral consultations with that country with the goal of eliminating the ``reverse preferences.'' Nine months later, USTR will make a determination of whether the ``reverse preferences'' have, or are likely to have, a significant adverse effect on U.S. commerce. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If USTR makes an affirmative determination, the country's status as a beneficiary developing country will be withdrawn or suspended, unless the country has agreed to eliminate the significant adverse effect. The review will terminate if the determination is negative. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> III. Public Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Interested parties are invited to submit comments regarding discriminatory ``reverse preferences'' that are granted by a GSP beneficiary country, and their effect on U.S. commerce. Interested parties are invited to report on any association agreements, or similar agreements, under which a GSP beneficiary country grants preferential treatment to products of another developed country, that has or may have an adverse effect on U.S. export interests. Preferential treatment may include preferential tariff treatment, as well as preferential non-tariff treatment (e.g., quotas). Interested parties are urged to give specific examples of U.S. export interests that have been adversely affected by ``reverse preferences.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In particular, interested parties are urges to be as specific as possible about: (1) Any product that is subject to different rates of duty by a GSP beneficiary country depending upon whether the product is imported from the United States or another developed country, such as the EU; (2) the various, actual, applicable rates of duty (i.e., bound, applied, preferential), as well as any scheduled rate reduction; (3) the level of trade in the subject product that the United States and other developed countries have with the GSP beneficiary; and (4) the size of the market in the beneficiary country. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments must be submitted in 15 copies, in English, to the Chairman of the GSP Subcommittee, Trade Policy Staff Committee, 600 17th Street, N.W., Room 513, Washington, D.C. 20506. Comments must be received no later than 5 p.m. on Wednesday, January 25, 1995. Information and comments will be subject to public inspection by appointment with the staff of the USTR Public Reading Room, except for information granted ``business confidential'' status pursuant to 15 CFR 2003.6 and 2007.7. If the document contains business confidential information, 15 copies of a nonconfidential version of the submission along with 15 copies of the confidential version must be submitted. The confidential version of the submission should be clearly marked ``Submitted in Confidence'' at the top and bottom of each and every page of the document. A nonconfidential summary of the confidential information must be included with the confidential submission, along with a written explanation of why the confidential material should be protected. The version which does not contain business confidential information (the public version) should also be clearly marked at the top and bottom of each and every page (either ``public version'' or ``non-confidential''). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> IV. Dominican Republic <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> In the 1993 Annual GSP Review, the GSP Subcommittee reviewed the worker rights practices and the adequacy and effectiveness of IPR protection in the Dominican Republic. Notwithstanding evidence of some progress on worker rights and IPR protection in the Dominican Republic during the course of the review, these two cases are continued when the results of the 1993 Annual GSP Review were announced on July 1, 1994. Since that decision, the Dominican Republic has made considerable progress on worker rights and has continued to make progress on IPR protection. In September, the Motion Picture Export Association of America, the domestic petitioner in the IPR case, withdrew its petition. In October, the AFL&hyph;CIO, the domestic petitioner in the worker rights case, withdrew its petition. Based on the continuing progress on worker rights and IPR protection in the Dominican Republic, as well as the withdrawal of the two petitions, the GSP reviews have been terminated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=2 --> Frederick L.

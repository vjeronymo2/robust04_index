			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / Housing reforms to go ahead The government is to press ahead with changes in housing policy designed to prevent 'queue-jumping' by homeless lone parents. This emerged last night after the Earl of Arran, junior environment minister, accused pressure groups of mounting 'a misleading and alarmist campaign' against the government's proposals. Pregnant teenagers, single parents and other vulnerable categories will no longer be guaranteed speedy access to the permanent tenancy of a house or flat. Instead they will be offered temporary accommodation, with guaranteed tenure of at least six months, while their housing needs are assessed along with those of other families already on waiting lists. Lord Arran assured the lords that a 'safety net' would be kept in place for all those who are classified as statutorily homeless. He said the government would make a statement next month outlining its response to the representations made about the new policy. Legislation to implement it is expected to be introduced in the new parliamentary session due to open in November. Baroness Hollis of Heigham, speaking from the Labour front bench, said the action taken by the government to force up the rents charged by local authorities and housing associations had contributed to the increase in homelessness. She called for the receipts from the sale of council houses to be made available to provide affordable accommodation for the homeless.</p>

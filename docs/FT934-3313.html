			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Warning from Courtaulds Textiles Shares in Courtaulds Textiles fell 10 per cent yesterday after the UK group warned that pre-tax profits for the year about to end would be below market expectations. The announcement was an unwelcome swansong from Mr Martin Taylor, the youthful chairman of Courtaulds Textiles, who next month starts his new role as chief executive of Barclays, the UK's largest bank. However, Mr Taylor, 41, who was head-hunted for the Barclays job partly because of his skill at dealing with the press and City analysts, denied feeling any embarrassment about giving the profits warning only three weeks before his departure. 'I'd rather handle it than leave it to my colleagues.' Courtaulds Textiles said it was unlikely profits for the year to December 31 would match last year's Pounds 39m. Analysts, who had cut their estimates to Pounds 41m-Pounds 43m after lower than expected interim profits of Pounds 13.7m, yesterday trimmed their full-year forecasts to about Pounds 37m. The shares closed 54p lower at 489p. The group had reported difficult conditions in continental Europe in September. It said yesterday that trading had deteriorated further in October and November. Mr Taylor said: 'In the UK, although there has been some recovery, the level of early autumn activity has not been maintained.' A particular problem was caused by a new factory near Derby in which the group had invested Pounds 10m to make Aristoc stockings. Teething problems prevented the plant reaching full capacity, so it lost sales and profits in the peak pre-Christmas manufacturing period. Mr Taylor was worried about the outlook for continental Europe, which last year accounted for 18 per cent of sales: 'We made no money in Europe in the first half and we are not going to make any in the second.' Two thirds of group profits were usually made in the second half. Only when management accounts for November were produced last week did the size of the shortfall became clear. The board was still expecting to recommend an increase in the final dividend. Lex, Page 24 London SE, Page 44</p>

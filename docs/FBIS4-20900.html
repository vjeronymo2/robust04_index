			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Nikolay Burbyga report: "It Is Not We But the United </F> States and Britain Which Are Ready To Produce Biological  Weapons, Russian Expert Believes"]    [Text] IZVESTIYA No. 40 published material from Britain's  THE SUNDAY TIMES in which it was claimed, with reference to  anonymous intelligence sources and the testimony of three  defectors, that the Russian Ministry of Defense, without the  knowledge of the country's president, is secretly carrying out  work on a program to create bioweapons.    The Russian Ministry of Defense described any suspicions  concerning Russia's violation of the ban on the development,  production, and stockpiling of biological weapons as "completely  groundless."    In his turn our correspondent succeeded in meeting with an  expert from one of Russia's special services who is well  acquainted with the results of visits by a Russian delegation to  biological facilities in the United States and Britain. What  did our specialists see there?    "A group of Russian experts visited several biological  facilities in the United States in February-March of this year.  These trips take place in the context of a  Russian-American-British accord on reciprocal visits to the  three countries' biological facilities. In the United States  our experts visited two enterprises belonging to a private  company, Pfizer, and the center for the study of animal  diseases, which belongs to the U.S. Department of Agriculture."    "At Pfizer's former plant for the production of biological  weapons, manufacturing equipment formerly intended for the  production of military-use biological compounds not only  survives and is maintained in good working order, but is even  being redesigned and modernized. No attempt was made to keep  the specialists from seeing technological-apparatus lines for  growing, concentrating, drying, mixing, and packaging biological  preparations having a dual purpose (civilian and military),  which, although they have not been operated for many years, are  maintained in good condition."    "Several of the firm's principal laboratories and production  buildings boast specific architectural-design solutions,  engineered systems for the protection of personnel and the  environment, hermetically sealed equipment and manufacturing  areas that do not correspond to the list presented by the firm  of microorganisms on which work is being carried out. In other  words, the possibility exists for conducting in these buildings  work with the pathogens of dangerous infectious diseases of man  and animal. It is noteworthy that right here our specialists  were not permitted to take a sample."    "In October last year and in January this year the Americans  and the British also visited our Pokrovskiy Biological  Preparations Plant, the Berdskiy and Omutninskiy Chemical  Combines, and the Scientific Research Institute of Applied  Microbiology in Obolensk. In 1992 American and British experts  were invited to participate in an independent commission set up  by directive of the Russian president to inspect the activity of  the Institute of Particularly Pure Biological Preparations in  St. Petersburg. That same institution which the West had  accused of working on a 'superplague.' The Western experts were  given the opportunity to visit unhindered any of the institute's  structural subdepartments, laboratories, and premises, to talk  with institute staffers, and to take photographs. It was  acknowledged that the institute's activity does not contravene  the 1972 Convention."    "In the United States our experts encountered a different  attitude, to put it mildly. The American side did not provide  conditions analogous to the visit of the U.S.-British delegation  to Russian nonmilitary biological facilities, as was stipulated  in the earlier-agreed documents. Our experts were not admitted  to several laboratories and one building. Tough restrictions on  photographing and videoing were established for us. They were  not allowed to take a biological sample. One facility was  opened for visiting only after a time delay, and only following  persistent demands from the delegation and our embassy. Things  were no better during the visit to the facilities of the company  Evans Medical Ltd in Britain."    "I think that the new round of accusations against us is no  coincidence. It is an attempt to preempt us. You see, a  session of the Preparatory Committee of the Special Conference  To Examine Potential Measures To Monitor the 1972 Convention is  due to be held soon. Russia's desire to establish tough and  wide-ranging measures to monitor compliance with the Convention  is clearly not to some people's liking."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Mozambique National Resistance Movement [Renamo]  President Afonso Dhlakama said in the city of Inhambane  yesterday that the ongoing registration of voters is not running  smoothly, allegedly because of fraud promoted by the ruling  party. Afonso Dhlakama was speaking at a news conference  shortly after the first provincial cadre conference that began  on 14 June.    Afonso Dhlakama said he had information that two Tanzanians  have been arrested in Cabo Delgado Province. They had been  registered for the October elections and were going to vote for  Frelimo [Mozambique Liberation Front]. Dhlakama accused  electoral registration officers of furthering the interests of  the ruling party, noting that they have been trained by Frelimo.  He said in registering voters, electoral officers show a  photograph of the president of the Republic, instructing the  electorate to vote for Joaquim Chissano.    Asked to comment on Renamo's plans to (?monitor the  registration of voters), Dhlakama said members of his movement  have already been selected for that purpose. He said tomorrow  Renamo monitors will be assigned to registration centers to put  an end to irregularities. Afonso Dhlakama also accused the  government of hindering the electoral process because no  registration centers have been established in certain  localities, forcing the residents to walk for miles to register.  Dhlakama noted that registration teams should meet the  electorate and not the other way round.    Turning to the role of Renamo advisers, Dhlakama said he was  disturbed with the manner in which they are being treated in  Inhambane Province. He said the advisers have no vehicles and  the governor is undermining their activities.    Turning to the Renamo conference, which was designed to  review party activities in the province, registration and  education of voters, and the adoption of a Renamo election  strategy, Dhlakama said those goals had been achieved. He  described the conference as positive.    Meanwhile, the command of the Republic of Mozambique Police  in Cabo Delgado Province has already denied Renamo's claim that  two Tanzanians had been detained after being registered as  voters.    Afonso Dhlakama has left for Xai-Xai for a meeting with  Renamo cadres. The Gaza provincial cadre conference was  scheduled to begin this afternoon, but had to be postponed due  to Dhlakama's late arrival. [passage omitted]    Renamo spokesman (Rehire Khan) yesterday accused the UN  Mozambique Civilian Police Command [Civpol] of collaborating  with the Mozambican Government in violation of the General Peace  Accord. (Khan) alleged that Civpol elements went to Chigubo  District without informing the Renamo advisers to the governor  of Gaza Province. (Khan) noted that Chigubo is a Renamo area.

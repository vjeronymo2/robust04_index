			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Television and Radio Review: Rise and shine to Fred Astaire  -Dance You will look in vain for anything of much merit in matter of dance on television this Christmas. Amid the slough of despond of the listings, there are a few programmes which aim for a dance audience: BBC TV has made a recording of Northern Ballet Theatre's oh-so-winsome dramatisation of A Christmas Carol, (BBC2, Christmas Day), and earlier in the afternoon there is A Tribute to Rudolph Nureyev (BBC2, Christmas Day), a repeat of a documentary, followed by a showing of Paul Czinner's film of Kenneth MacMillan's Romeo and Juliet with Fonteyn and Nureyev. It is a very mixed blessing: you can see the original cast of all the supporting roles, but Czinner's cinematic style was stuffy, and Fonteyn and Nureyev were among the worst interpreters of the lovers ever seen at Covent Garden. (The chance to film Lynn Seymour in one of her grandest achievements  -the role made for her - was, of course, missed.) Apart from this miserable list - nothing. No doubts as to what the independent stations' policy is towards elitist and snobbish old dance. BBC2 will show Holiday Inn (Christmas Eve) with Fred Astaire at 8.10am on (don't forget to set your alarm clock - and again on Sunday for the immortal Fred in The Barkleys of Broadway at 8.25am). And a perfectly tiresome holiday to all those who concocted the TV schedules.</p>

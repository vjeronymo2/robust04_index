			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Major tour ends on note of gloom MR JOHN MAJOR completed his pre-summit tour of European capitals yesterday with stark reminders from Dublin and The Hague over the scale of the difficulty he faces in achieving a wide-ranging accord in Edinburgh this weekend. The contrasting approaches of Ireland and the Netherlands on the key issue of financing of the Community led officials in London to describe the mood as far from 'optimistic'. On his return, the prime minister claimed that he had made progress but immediately was at pains to add that he could not recall a summit with so many important issues on its agenda, all inter-linked. In an attempt to cast an encouraging light, he added that often the results only came in the denouement. 'We must wait and see,' he said. However, his meetings yesterday only served to underline the strongly-held disagreements that remain. Whereas Mr Ruud Lubbers, the Dutch premier, made it clear that he is doggedly opposed to a substantial increase in Community spending, Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister sided firmly with his southern European allies in seeking a generous settlement. It also emerged that Ireland is in dispute with the European Commission over criteria by which the new cohesion fund would be distributed. Dublin claims proposals leave it at a disadvantage to its Mediterranean partners. Downing Street conceded that northern and southern member states were still 'a long way apart' on financing questions, adding that lack of an agreement might scupper hopes of pressing on with EC enlargement. There was a little more hope of reaching an accord over the terms Denmark is seeking to aid its ratification of the treaty. However, officials pointed out that grave doubts remained among several member states over the legal validity of the compromises now being sought by Copenhagen. Although EC presidencies tend to be pessimistic prior to a summit to accentuate subsequent successes, there appeared genuine anxiety. Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, said in Brussels last night: 'I'm past the stage where I'm an optimist or a pessimist.' Mr Major is due to meet Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president, tomorrow.</p>

			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / Schemes earmarked for government spending cuts The schemes identified by Mr Portillo cost more than Pounds 350m in 1993-94, excluding receipts from loans, but spending on some of the programmes is scheduled to fall over the following three years while others rise modestly, Andrew Baxter writes. In detail, the schemes are: Regional selective assistance: discretionary grants to support investment projects in assisted areas cost an estimated Pounds 89.2m in 1993-94, up from Pounds 71m in 1992-93. A further increase to Pounds 104m is planned by 1996-97. Consultancy initiative for small companies: along with local business support, this cost an estimated Pounds 92.2m in 1993-94, down slightly from Pounds 95.2m in 1992-93, and is planned to fall to Pounds 83m in 1996-97. Launch aid: a risk-sharing investment by government in the development of civil aerospace projects, payments dropped from Pounds 32.9m in 1992-93 to an estimated Pounds 4.6m in 1993-94. Plans are for payments of Pounds 6.6m this year, Pounds 25.3m in 1995-96 - including Pounds 20m to Short Brothers for the Learjet 45 project - and Pounds 8.4m in 1996-97. The government's net receipts, which it gets once projects reach a certain production stage, were an estimated Pounds 58.1m in 1993-94. After falling this year they are budgeted to rise to Pounds 80.9m by 1996-97. Shipbuilding: loans of Pounds 21m were made under the Home Shipbuilding Credit Guarantee Scheme in 1992-93. Loan payments received in 1993-94 were about Pounds 6.8m. Receipts will stay around this level until 1996-97. The Shipbuilding Intervention Fund made grants of about Pounds 22m in 1993-94, but these will fall to Pounds 6m by 1996-97. Space: the National Space Programme cost Pounds 20.4m in 1992-93, falling to an estimated Pounds 14.7m in 1993-94. Again, spending is due to decline further, to Pounds 9.2m this year and Pounds 6.3m in 1996-97. On top of this is the cost of membership to the European Space Agency, which Mr Portillo wants reconsidered. Total agency spending by the DTI was an estimated Pounds 76.8m in 1993-94, rising gradually to a planned Pounds 80.5m in 1996-97. R&amp;D spending on non-nuclear energy technologies: this was an estimated Pounds 35.6m in 1993-94, up slightly on the Pounds 33.4m of the previous year. It will stay at about Pounds 30m-Pounds 31m a year until 1996-97. The lion's share goes to renewable and novel sources of energy. Export promotion: programmes in 'established markets' are targeted by Mr Portillo. Europe and North America accounted for 36 per cent of export promotion spending in 1992. Total gross spending on international trade and export promotion was an estimated Pounds 56.7m in 1993-94, to rise to Pounds 60.9m in 1996-97.</p>

			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Letter: Public should be told reality of life assurance contributions Sir, Messrs Ross and Scurfield's predictable defence of the life assurance industry (Letters, January 29) ignores a simple truth - most policyholders do not KNOW that large proportions of their savings are being siphoned out of first year contributions to fund the industry sales system. All that is asked is they tell them. If the public are told and accept that 90 per cent of the first contribution to a pension scheme is paid away in commissions and acquisition costs so be it. But let the public be the judge. They should publish their commission scales. It is the responsibility of the life industry to justify its charges, not to hide them behind cleverly worded policy constructions the public do not understand. One cannot compare long-term, equity-based investments with deposit-based savings. In the latter there is no capital risk and instant access without penalty. This is neither a fair comparison nor an addition to balanced debate. They may like to consider why an endowment policy is sold in preference to either a unit trust or PEP in the majority of cases. The answer, of course, is one word - commission. Messrs Ross and Scurfield know it. The industry knows it. Every salesman (IFA or tied) knows it. They are just too frightened to admit it. They may claim that the SIB survey is flawed but they can hardly deny their own policy conditions. They weave a tangled web. It is time it was stopped.

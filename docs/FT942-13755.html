			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Canada farm exports at risk The Clinton administration yesterday stepped up its war of words with Canada over bilateral farm trade by outlining proposed curbs on Canadian wheat, flour and barley under Article 28 of Gatt. But the measures will not take effect for 90 days, leaving the door open for further talks to resolve the disputes. Article 28 allows a country to impose new trade restrictions in cases where existing duties are considered too low to provide adequate protection for domestic producers. But it also permits the target country to seek compensation through tariff increases of its own. Canada has threatened to retaliate against a range of US products, including chicken, wine, Bourbon whiskey, canned fruit and mushrooms. US agriculture secretary Mike Espy said that if the negotiations with Canada fail, a quota will be imposed on Canadian imports from July 1. Imports above the quote will be subject to punitive tariffs. The quotas will be subject to negotiation. The immediate cause of the friction is a surge in Canadian exports of durum wheat, used mainly for pasta, which US farmers claim is disrupting their domestic price-support programmes. But the Clinton administration has also linked the grain dispute to complaints about Canada's supply-management system, which protects poultry, egg and dairy producers from foreign competition.</p>

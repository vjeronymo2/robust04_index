			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Ruslan Maysigov] </F>   [Text] Nazran January 4 TASS -- The new year has brought  new problems into the Republic of Ingushetia where shops and  everyday service facilities refuse to accept 50,000 rouble  banknotes from their clients under various pretexts.    The republic has been lately swept by rumours about an  upcoming money reform in Russia. Having learnt the bitter  lesson of previous money reforms, workers and employees of state  organisations and enterprises also refuse to take their salaries  in 50,000 rouble notes. Earlier such rumours rattled the  neighbouring Chechen Republic.    Meanwhile, black marketeers and shadow economy dealers are  buying up the rejected bills for 45,000 roubles in banknotes of  10,000 and 5,000 rouble denomination.    abdul-Khamid Aushev, a Russian Central Bank representative  in  Ingushetia, said that "such rumours are being spread by  mafia-like structures and hard currency dealers for their own  benefit." Aushev said he had contacted the Central Bank which  had denied these rumours as groundless.</p>

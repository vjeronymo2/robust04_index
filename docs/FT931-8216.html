			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / S African multi-party talks to resume MULTI-PARTY talks on a new South African constitution will resume early next month, the first such meeting since talks broke down last May over the issue of multi-racial power-sharing. Two crucial meetings which took place this week - bilateral talks between the government and the mainly Zulu Inkatha Freedom Party, and a meeting of the national executive of the African National Congress - cleared the way for the resumption of multi-party talks. The three parties, and others from across the political spectrum, plan to meet on March 5 and 6 to plan the resumption of full democracy talks. Negotiators from the government and Inkatha, who ended a three-day meeting yesterday in Natal, said they had made progress on constitutional issues. However, the gap between Inkatha and the ANC - bitter rivals in Natal - remains huge over such issues as devolution of power to regional governments and whether the new constitution should be written by an appointed or elected body. The government and the ANC have already reached outline agreement on many issues, including a plan to rule together in coalition until the end of the century, and they have made clear they will proceed without Inkatha if it resists their proposals. Yesterday the ANC launched its campaign for the first multi-racial elections, expected sometime next year, calling on international delegates to a 'solidarity conference' near Soweto to contribute funds to the campaign. ANC officials said they would be discussing their sanctions policy at the conference, and would announce a major shift in policy tomorrow. South African police said they were investigating a complaint that former president PW Botha had assaulted his gardener. Gardener Jan Louw accused Mr Botha and his bodyguard of hitting him earlier this month during an argument over whether he had been drinking on duty.</p>

Yushkaytis; UDC 681.586:681.7.068]    [Abstract] A method is proposed for construction of  multiplex systems of fiber-optical interferometric sensors  entirely without optical directional couplers. In these systems,  the signal waves are formed by reflecting a portion of the  radiation, propagating in the fiber lightguide, from semi-  transparent mirrors, built within it, or from the internal  nonhomogenieties of the lightguide itself. When they arrive back  into the laser cavity, the lasing amplitude changes. Small  changes in the length of the optical path in the lightguide,  caused by the physical effects, which are being examined, can be  detected by controlling the laser output. Theoretical  relationships are developed for a frequency-modulated laser with  optical feedback and the carrier frequency modulation method for  multiplex sensors is discussed. Modulation characteristics of a  He-Ne laser, the bistability of the longitudinal modes are  examined and the effect of cross-talk is estimated. Autodyne  multiplex sensors including underwater acoustics antenna and  temperature sensors are also briefly discussed. The experimental  study of frequency-scanned He-Ne-laser operating with different  lightguide systems demonstrated that an autodyne detection is  suitable for application with distributed sensors employing a  Rayleigh scattering signal.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Paris, Feb 2 (AFP) -- The French Government  announced aid totalling 300 million francs ($50 million) to the  fishing industry Wednesday [2 February] after violent protests  by fishermen protesting at low prices for their catches.    Agriculture and Fisheries Minister Jean Puech told  fishermen's representatives here they could have half in grants  and half in low-interest loans, with 10 million francs released  immediately for families in the most difficulty.    Puech also said all fishing firms would have their welfare  charges cut by half, at an estimated total cost of 83 million  francs, and added that he had asked the European Community to  fix minimum prices for seven species of fish.    French fishermen on the west coast have kept their boats in  port and staged frequent clashes with police since their  protests came to a head last weekend as fish prices fell to an  all-time low.    They have said that by Monday all fish markets would be  closed, with nothing to auction.    Wednesday's handouts came before a scheduled meeting between  Prime Minister Edouard Balladur and Puech with fishermen at  Rennes, the Brittany capital, on Friday, when they had been  promised a stormy reception.    In the north Brittany port of Roscoff late Tuesday some 100  fishermen and their wives seized and dumped crates of Scottish  fish that had arrived by ferry from Plymouth, southern England,  police said Wednesday.    Further south, in Lorient, fishermen sacked refrigerated  warehouses in violent clashes which injured 17 police. Nine  protestors were arrested and released only after a battle at the  police station where they were being held.    In Brussels a European Commission spokesman said earlier  Wednesday that the commission does not intend any immediate  reestablishment of minimum import prices for certain fish  species, since no European Community member had requested such a  move.    Such minimum prices were set for the March-December period  last year for six species, while a minimum price for Atlantic  salmon was applied from mid-November last year until January 31  this year.    The spokesman said no member had supplied the commission  with  figures showing a marked drop in market prices for one or more  species.    At the most recent meeting of EC fishing ministers, held in  December, the commission pledged to reintroduce such minimum  prices as soon as circumstances called for it.    The EC fishing ministers are not scheduled to meet again  until April 12.    Speaking after a cabinet meeting here earlier Wednesday,  Puech conceded that fish prices had "fallen sharply" and that  the situation was "very difficult."    "Emergency measures" are needed, he said, adding: "The  government will actively support this sector."    The government announcement also came as Brittany fishermen  were heading for a mass demonstration Thursday in the channel  port of Boulogne-sur-Mer, the main port for fish imports.    The strikers voted to allow ferries to continue operating  provided they carry no fish.    Breton fishermen greeted Puech's package with skepticism  late  Wednesday, saying that it would make little difference.</p>

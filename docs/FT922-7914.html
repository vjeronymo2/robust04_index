			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Seoul adds to Hyundai squeeze THE South Korean government yesterday threatened new credit sanctions against Hyundai a day before Mr Chung Ju-yung, the founder of the conglomerate, formally launches his independent presidential campaign. The Office of Bank Supervision (OBS) said it would bar Hyundai from making new investments or acquiring real estate unless it collects Won202.7bn (Pounds 145m) Hyundai lent to the Chung family earlier this year. The Chung family is believed to have used the funds to help finance creation of the Unification National party, which is expected to nominate Mr Chung today as its candidate in the December presidential election. Hyundai recently promised it would recover the loans by the end of the year, but the OBS said the money should be repaid by this summer. Hyundai has suffered credit restrictions as a result of the dispute. It believes that it recently lost a contract to build the Tsing Ma bridge for the Hong Kong airport project because the squeeze on its credit undermined confidence in its financial position.</p>

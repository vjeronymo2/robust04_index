			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by correspondent Celso Pinto from Marrakech] </F>   [Text] U.S. Vice President Al Gore yesterday strongly  advocated the inclusion of social working conditions on the  agenda of the future World Trade Organization (WTO). Brazilian  Foreign Minister Celso Amorim, however, was the one who most  strongly opposed this idea.    The issue is sensitive, especially for developing countries,  but the three days of debate among the countries of the General  Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (GATT), which ended yesterday in  Marrakech, suggest that the issue will not be discarded. It  ended up becoming a compulsory point of reference in the  speeches of the ministers, and also a factor that neatly marked  a division for the future.    Gore's closing speech, and the speech delivered by Amorim a  short time before, were the most clear examples of the final  session. "Economic growth cannot be maintained if it ends up  producing social convulsion," Gore said to representatives of  more than 120 countries. "A global system of commerce that does  not eliminate exploitation will collapse in the end, because  people around the world will not support it," he noted.    Gore did not clarify what precisely the United States is  expecting in this regard, but noted that there is concern about  extreme situations of manpower exploitation. The implication is  that this might produce unfair competition. He said, however,  that "the United States will resist any attempt to turn the  issue of improved working conditions into a form of  protectionism."    Amorim not only considered "inappropriate" the debate on the  subject, but believes that it raises the fear of the appearance  of "global protectionism, which opens the way to the exportation  of technologically sophisticated goods produced by developed  countries, and closes the door to our competitive exports." The  social conditions issue, he suggested, might result "in the  exportation of unemployment from rich to poor countries,  transferring a social burden that poor countries cannot bear."    The idea of "global protectionism," which Amorim later  explained to this newspaper, entails the fear that developing  countries will end up paying twice: by opening several markets,  through the Uruguay Round of talks, and by having their exports  hindered in the sector in which they are most competitive. The  fear is that by using the concept of "social dumping,"  economically developed countries can find a way to ban  importations from industrial areas where low manpower cost is a  comparative advantage of developing countries.    Even though there are substantial differences with the U.S.  position, Amorim praised Gore's public commitment to avoid using  the "social issue" as a veiled form of protectionism. Even rich  countries are far from having reached an agreement on the  subject. For example, British representative Timothy Sainsbury  said that Great Britain "is not convinced that the WTO and the  international trade system provide the best context for  addressing the subject." German Minister Gunther Rexrodt  advocated a "multilateral discussion," provided the matter "does  not become an instrument for commercial restrictions or for a  new source of protectionism."    Gore also put strong emphasis on the environment, in this  case with Brazilian support. There is consensus on the subject  within GATT, and a subcommittee will make a comprehensive  analysis of relations between the protection of the environment  and trade during the installation phase of the WTO (which should  come into operation at the beginning of 1995). After its  creation, the WTO will have a special committee for the issue,  which will function until 1996.    Gore was the highest-ranking official attending the signing  of the Uruguay Round agreement in Marrakech. His presence was  aimed at giving a high profile to President Bill Clinton's  commitment to free trade, which became confusing immediately  after the conclusion of the Uruguay Round in December with the  threat of using unilateral legislation (Super 301) in the  commercial area. Both Gore and U.S. negotiator Mickey Kantor  reiterated Clinton's commitment to the commercial opening.    Japan, which was the main potential victim of Super 301,  adopted a hard stance on the issue. Japanese Foreign Minister  Tsutomu Hata said in his speech that his country is "deeply  concerned about the protection of domestic industries by the  abuse of antidumping measures, which will lead to the adoption  of unilateral measures and to the promotion of regionalism."  This was a veiled message for the United States.    In a meeting with Gore after the GATT session, Hata--who is  considered a likely candidate for the post of new Japanese prime  minister--assured that the new government in Japan would not  change its commercial opening policy, and would continue along  the course of the liberalization reform. The United States  expects more concessions in this area, in order to avoid  imposing commercial sanctions on the Japanese.    Japan, like the United States and the other main GATT  members, reaffirmed its willingness to ratify the Uruguay Round  in 1994, in order to make feasible the target of beginning WTO  operations on 1 January 1995. Ambassador Paulo Nogueira Batista  has told this newspaper that there has been a change in the  strategy for negotiations over the Uruguay Round. Instead of  submitting it to Congress, the U.S. executive branch decided to  submit it separately to the Senate. This will call for approval  by a two-thirds vote, and not by a simple majority, but will  give the Round the status of an international treaty, and this  is very important. Precisely because GATT does not have this  status (because of U.S. resistance at the time it was created),  the U.S. Congress does not refrain from applying commercial laws  that oppose multilateral regulations. If the U.S. Congress  approves the WTO, it will be more difficult, for example, to use  instruments like the Super 301, Nogueira Batista has said.    Minister Celso Amorim believes that this aspect of the  Uruguay Round, as an instrument for reinforcing multilateral  mechanisms and multilateral discipline in world trade, is  perhaps its main benefit. Obviously, there were gains with the  reduction of tariffs on industrial products and reductions of  agricultural subsidies.  <H5>  Pressure From Brazil </H5>   However, not all Brazilian expectations were met. For  example, Brazil ended up obtaining a tariff reduction--beyond  the average tariff--for orange juice of only 15 percent in the  United States, and 20 percent in Europe. The Europeans made a  much more generous offer, but backed down on their word at the  last minute, under pressure from Spain and Italy.    At a bilateral meeting yesterday with Sir Leon Brittan, the  European official for commerce, Amorim reiterated his hope that  "it will not be necessary for us to wait for a new round for  Europeans to give us fairer treatment."    Amorim yesterday met with representatives of the Czech  Republic, China, Uruguay, and Morocco. He and other ministers  also had lunch with Kantor. To Chinese Minister Gu Yongjian,  Amorim reiterated his expectation that the Chinese will refrain  from buying agricultural products on the international market  from countries that subsidize their agriculture.</p>

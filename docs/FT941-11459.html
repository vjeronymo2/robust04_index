			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / British Coal prepares to shut three more pits British Coal yesterday signalled the closure of three more pits as it neared the end of a programme to rationalise the industry for privatisation. Closure of the Ellington pit, the last deep mine in the north-east of England, is likely to be confirmed today. Review meetings, usually the precursor of closure, are also being arranged soon for the Annesley and Ollerton mines in Nottinghamshire. Yesterday's announcement will leave British Coal with two fewer working pits than envisaged in October 1992 when the corporation announced closure of three-fifths of the industry but was forced to backtrack because of public outcry. Although one or two further pits may be closed before privatisation as their seams near exhaustion, most which have not been earmarked for closure are likely to be offered to the private sector in the five sale packages being prepared by the government. Yesterday's three pits bring to six the total identified for closure this week, although that includes Silverwood in the Yorkshire region, which is not being developed and is being merged with nearby Maltby. This will leave British Coal with 17 working pits, including the Silverwood/Maltby merged unit. Asfordby in Leicestershire has yet to open and is likely to be offered as part of one of the packages. All six pits identified for closure this week were, until recently, considered to have safe futures. The others identified or named for closure at the start of this week were Goldthorpe, in the Yorkshire area, and Manton in Nottinghamshire. The other survivors are: Kellingley, Kiveton, North Selby, Prince of Wales, Riccall, Stillingfleet, Whitemoor and Wistow, all in the Yorkshire area; Bilsthorpe, Daw Mill, Harworth, Thoresby and Welbeck, all in the Midlands; Longannet in Scotland; and Tower and Point of Ayr in Wales.

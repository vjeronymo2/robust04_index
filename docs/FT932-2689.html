			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / International Company News: Indus urges rethink on import duties INDUS Motor, the Karachi-based affiliate of Toyota, yesterday appealed for reversal of a reduction on import duties for cars, announced in Monday's Pakistani budget. Monday's budget reduced import tariffs and other taxes for cars across the board, with the duties on 1300cc cars, similar to the Corolla assembled by Indus, reduced from 197 per cent to 100 per cent. In response to the company's plea, the government yesterday announced it was setting up a committee to consider appeals from Indus and any other companies who claimed to be affected. Mr Sartaj Aziz, the finance minister, said that the committee would begin hearings within 72 hours and finalise its recommendations within the next two weeks. Indus Motor began producing Corollas in April this year, from its Rs1.5bn (Dollars 56.43m) plant at Qasim, near Karachi. The plant has an annual capacity of between 20,000 and 40,000 vehicles. Toyota has a 25 per cent stake in the company.</p>

			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Foreign &amp; Colonial assets and dividend up FOREIGN &amp; Colonial Investment Trust has increased its final dividend by 11.6 per cent, a greater rise than had been forecast at the interim stage. The shares rose 2 1/2 p to 174 1/2 p on the news. The investment trust, the UK's largest, said that the increase reflected its strong revenue position, rather than any confidence in the prospects for future dividend growth. 'It may well be that in the 1990s, it will prove impossible to increase dividends and net assets at the same rate as in the 1980s' said Mr John Sclater, chairman. In 1991, the trust's net assets per share grew by 21.6 per cent, outperforming the FT-A All-Share Index. F&amp;C benefited from its decision to borrow money and invest in the weak equity markets of 1990. Net assets per share at end-1991 were 184.5p, compared with 151.7p at end-1990. Earnings per share were 3.38p (3.29p) and total net assets were Pounds 969.4m (Pounds 797m). The final dividend was 2.12p (1.9p), making a total of 3.19p (2.9p), the 21st consecutive annual increase. At the end of 1991, the trust's portfolio was split in assets terms between; the UK (41 per cent); US (27 per cent); Japan (9 per cent); Far East (3 per cent) and Europe (18 per cent). F&amp;C uses the foreign exchange markets to mismatch its asset and currency exposure. In currency terms, it had a relatively greater exposure to Japan and Europe than it had in asset terms. The trust was the first to introduce a savings scheme and it said it had passed the 50,000 shareholder mark early this year. Private investors now own 35 per cent of the company. Mr Michael Hart, joint manager of the trust, said that he was 'fairly hopeful about the UK market. It is lowly rated, although the big uncertainty is the election. If the Conservatives win, everyone will be cheered up and interest rates will come down.' Mr Hart was optimistic about Europe which will benefit from an eventual fall in German interest rates and regarding Japan, he said the position 'looks pretty terrible on the surface, but we are doing some cautious buying.'</p>

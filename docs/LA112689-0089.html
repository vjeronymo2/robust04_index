			<p><P> November 26, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TOLERANCE, DIVERSITY IN NEWPORT-MESA SCHOOLS  </P> <P> Regarding sex education in the Newport-Mesa school district, Bonnie O'Neil  states that the curriculum should be chosen by "selected" parents and school  personnel. Who will select the "selected" parents and by what and whose  criteria? Will they be selected so that they ensure the students are presented  with incomplete, inaccurate information that will ill prepare them to make  life's difficult choices in this ever more complicated world?  </P> <P> High school age students are not gullible little children whose behavior and  values can be twisted any which way. If they are taught the "right" values at  home then Ms. O'Neil need have no fear they will misuse the complete, accurate  information they receive in a sex education class.  </P> <P> JEAN WINTERFELT  </P> <P> Newport Beach  </P></p>

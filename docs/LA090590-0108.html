			<p><P> September 5, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE;  </P> <P> MEN FIGHT OFFICERS, SEE SPORTS CAR BURN  </P> <P> Two men were arrested Tuesday after they led police on a chase at speeds of up  to 120 m.p.h. that ended in Irvine in a fight with police and the destruction  of their sports car.  </P> <P> Masaaki Tachiki, 22, and Kinichi Nikashimi, 19, both of Northridge, were  arrested at about 1:30 a.m. Tuesday and booked into Orange County Jail on  suspicion of evading arrest and assaulting two police officers, California  Highway Patrol spokeswoman Officer Angel Johnson said.  </P> <P> Johnson said the men were spotted by two CHP officers at 1:15 a.m., speeding  southbound along the San Diego Freeway near the Euclid Street off-ramp.  </P> <P> The officers gave chase. As the car neared heavy traffic, the driver veered the  Pontiac Trans Am sports car onto the right shoulder to pass the slower-moving  cars. The two men got off the freeway at Irvine Center Drive, and the car spun  out of control, Johnson said. When the officers pulled up behind the stopped  car, the men jumped out of the Trans Am and started to fight the officers but  were subdued, Johnson said.  </P> <P> Suddenly, while the four stood outside the parked cars, the Trans Am burst into  flames.JAMES M.

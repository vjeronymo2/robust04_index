			<p>BFN     [Text] Canberra, May 3 (XINHUA) -- Tian Jiyun,  vice-chairman of the Chinese National People's Congress (NPC),  arrived in Australia's largest city of Sydney this evening to  start a week-long visit to the country.    Tian said in a written statement upon his arrival that the  visit by the NPC delegation to Australia is to "enhance the  existing links and contacts between the Chinese NPC and the  Australian Parliament and to expand the friendly cooperative  relations between our two countries."    Tian, who is heading the NPC delegation, also said that he  was looking forward to meetings with leaders of the Australian  Parliament and government to exchange views on the issues of  common concern.    He also expressed his wish to have an opportunity to make  contacts with people from all walks of life including those from  the industrial, commercial and business circles.    Tian expressed his belief that his visit to Australia "will  be a great success."    It is understood that during his stay in Australia, Tian  will  tour Canberra and the states of Victoria, New South Wales and  Queensland.    He will also have meetings with leaders of the Federal  Parliament and Government on furthering the contacts between the  two parliaments.    Australia is the last leg of Tian's trip to the South  Pacific, which has already brought him to New Zealand, Western  Samoa and Papua New Guinea.</p>

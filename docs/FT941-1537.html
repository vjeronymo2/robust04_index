			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Pacific Rim recovers again as Tokyo falls Heavy profit-taking ahead of the March 31 book closing left the Nikkei index 1.4 per cent lower, for its fourth consecutive daily decline, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei lost 291.43 to 19,962.10, breaching 20,000 for the first time in nine days. The index rose to a high of 20,322.03 in the morning session, but steadily lost ground on profit-taking, hitting a low of 19,937.99 just before the close. Tuesday's plunge in the bond market triggered selling of equities by investors hoping to cover losses on their bond portfolios. Traders expect the liquidation by companies to continue throughout the week and predict volatility up to the start of the new business year. Volume rose to 400m shares from 370m. Foreign demand, which has supported Japanese shares recently, subsided while domestic institutions, arbitrageurs, corporations, and individuals were also sellers. The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 13.59 to 1,614.42 while the Nikkei 300 closed down 2.75 to 296.52. Declines led advances by 758 to 274 with 154 issues remaining unchanged. In London, the ISE/Nikkei index rose 2.225 to 1,334.00. Pharmaceutical shares were weaker on reports that the health ministry had instructed makers of interferon alpha, an anti-cancer drug, to issue stronger warnings that it induces depression and suicidal tendencies. Takeda Chemical Industries fell Y40 to Y1,250 and Fujisawa Pharmaceutical lost Y40 to Y1,160. Hanwa, the steel trader which faces mounting debts as a result of speculation on the financial markets during the late 1980s, fell Y54 to Y569 after the issue met heavy selling from a Japanese broker. Large capital steels were down on profit-taking. Nippon Steel fell Y8 to Y342 and Kawasaki Steel fell Y4 to Y365. Corporate selling also hit high-technology stocks, with Hitachi down Y19 to Y950 and Toshiba down Y17 to Y773. Speculative issues were higher in active trading. Sumitomo Coal Mining rose Y45 to Y856 and Izutsuya gained Y25 to Y734. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 179.09 to 22,170.78 in volume of 157.2m shares. Roundup The resolution of interest rate speculation in the US unleashed buyers around the Pacific Rim. Karachi was closed for Pakistan national day. HONG KONG climbed by 5 per cent although Jardine Matheson fell HKDollars 4.75 to HKDollars 49.25 before it was suspended from trading in the afternoon. Brokers said that the Fed's rise in short-term interest rates removed a key uncertainty. Linking that to the view that the market was oversold, institutions pushed the Hang Seng index up by 453.36 to 9,465.53, in indicated turnover up from HKDollars 6.73bn to HKDollars 7.82bn. Jardine group companies fell after Jardine Matheson, the parent, said that it would cancel its local listing at the end of this year. Swire Pacific A leapt HKDollars 5.50 to HKDollars 58.50 on a rush of switching orders. BANGKOK put on another 4 per cent after the Thai bourse eased margin loan regulations, triggering active bargain hunting by domestic investment funds. The SET index closed 49.32 per cent higher at 1,286.44 in moderate turnover of Bt7.4bn, the buying focusing on finance and communications issues. KUALA LUMPUR credited retail buying and foreign funds as the KLSE composite index closed just short of the 1,000 level, up 32.47 or 3.4 per cent at 999.95. SINGAPORE noted late profit taking from both Hong Kong and London, but the Straits Times Industrial index still ended 66.24, or 3.2 per cent higher at 2,111.28. AUSTRALIA bought on the Fed news and on a sharp jump in local futures, the All Ordinaries index ending 40.1, or 1.9 per cent better at 2,180.9. On the Sydney futures market, the March share price index shot up 60 to 2,205.0 on short-covering. In the cash market, blue chip and resource stocks reflected overseas buying in the morning, mainly from Asia, and domestic institutional investment in the afternoon. TAIWAN rose for the third straight day, helped by a rally in financials and Hong Kong's recovery. The weighted index closed 69.43 up at 5,331.27 and turnover rose by TDollars 10bn to TDollars 49.8bn. BOMBAY's speculators sold to get out of overbought positions, the BSE index closing 64.96 lower at 3,726.82. The effect of the ban on the carry forward, or 'badla' system of trading, was reinforced on Tuesday when the stock exchange declared a broker in default.</p>

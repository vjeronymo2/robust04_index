			<p>930809 FT  09 AUG 93 / No more buried treasure: The economic argument is winning in the UK coal debate What is to be done with Britain's coal? There it lies underground, some 2bn tons of it: enough to power the nation - in theory, at least - for several hundred years. But after nearly a millennium of working, the cheap coal has gone. The world has vast new reserves to exploit, and British coal no longer repays the cost of digging it up. In pure economic terms, what is the case against closing the pits tomorrow? The point can be put another way. The world has a finite stock of hydrocarbons. Eventually, as they start to run out, the price will rise. That may take another century or two; but at some point, British coal will acquire a value again. Is it not in the national interest meanwhile to leave it where it is? The coal industry has a standard answer to this. Even if you stop mining, the pits cost Pounds 2m a year each to maintain. If you do not maintain them, they collapse. In that case, if you wanted to regain access to the coal, you would have to dig pits again from scratch, at a cost in today's money of Pounds 400m-Pounds 500m each. Meanwhile, you are left with huge liabilities in terms of redundancy, industrial sickness and land subsidence. In the long run, none of this makes real economic sense. The liabilities are a matter of historical fact: the only question is when they are to be addressed. As for the cost of new pits, that is simply part of the calculation. If the coal price is high enough to justify it, well and good. If not, good again. But hang on, says the coal lobby. If you shut the pits, you are throwing away two kinds of asset: the coal itself, and the means of getting to it. And in terms of the national interest, if you import coal, what about the balance of payments? This does not make economic sense either. If a thing costs more to obtain than it will sell for, it is not an asset. There is quite a lot of gold and silver underground in Britain. It stays there because it costs too much to recover. No one suggests digging it up regardless, as a means of helping the trade balance. Subsidising production for the sake of import substitution is simple inefficiency. And British coal is massively subsidised. The director-general of electricity supply puts the amount, in the form of an artificially high coal price, at Pounds 2.3bn over the past three years. That cost is paid by the British public, through a higher electricity price. As a tax on business it is a misallocation of resources. As a tax on individuals it is wickedly regressive, since it hits hardest those who spend most time at home: the old, the sick and the unemployed. As for the asset value of the pits themselves, that is mostly depreciated. Where it is not, there is still no point in throwing good money after bad. There is an analogy to be drawn from the oil industry. Installing a platform in the North Sea costs around Pounds 500m, the same as sinking a pit. The oil company will carry on producing until the running costs are higher than the value of the oil. It will then shut the platform down. This involves environmental liabilities, just as with coal. There is also the same option of going back for the remaining oil a century hence. The sums may be tricky: but even if they showed the investment to have been misconceived in the first place, no commercial oil company could convince its shareholders that it should therefore go on running it at a loss. It might be argued that to characterise the whole British coal industry as uneconomic is too sweeping. Certainly, open-cast mining is profitable, and a handful of pits might be so. In pure economic terms, there is one simple way to find out. Let each pit operate as a separate commercial entity, competing freely on price. The obvious risk is that short-term price-cutting could prove so ferocious as to drive inherently viable pits out of business. But it should not be beyond the wit of government - which still has a hand in setting the UK coal price - to devise some kind of transitional arrangement. Above all, the coal industry is now so small as to be in economic terms almost irrelevant. The whole value of Britain's coal reserves at today's price is roughly equal to a month's output of the national economy. In turnover terms, British Coal is smaller than Bass, the UK brewer, and half the size of J Sainsbury, the British supermarket chain. It still employs 20,000 miners, and to put them out of work would be atrocious. But these are atrocious times. BT laid off 19,000 workers on a single Friday in July last year. The political dimension, of course, is something else again. The government tried to wash its hands of the whole affair by privatising electricity, thus aiming to expose the coal industry to the free market. But as it found to its consternation last October, coal still strikes an atavistic chord with the British voter. The whole of the foregoing argument is therefore in one sense irrelevant. However much the government accepts the case, it will proceed only timidly and by degrees. But in another sense, it is the political argument that is irrelevant. Production of British coal has fallen remorsely for almost 40 years, as has the number of miners. In 1955, British Coal's staff totalled over 700,000. It is now 44,000. In other words, over the long haul the economic logic is winning. It is worth putting such figures in context. Between 1973 and 1990, British coal production fell by 2.2 per cent a year on average. Across Europe as a whole, production fell by 2.3 per cent. The reason is obvious enough. Europe led the world in the industrial revolution, and used coal to do it. A country like China still has massively rich seams of coal because it is at an earlier stage of economic development. If there is cheap coal to be had elsewhere, the industrialised nations should count themselves fortunate. The demise of British coal is not a sign of decline. With luck, it should be a sign of progress.</p>

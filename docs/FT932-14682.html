			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / Building materials groups act on margins SOME construction materials companies are managing to raise prices to rebuild profit margins, but many are having difficulty making the increases stick. Customers of cement group Blue Circle have already received notification of price rises of between 2 per cent and 3.5 per cent to take effect from June. For the rise to stick, Blue Circle needs its big customers, such as RMC, to pass on the increase through higher concrete prices. RMC has not officially decided on such a move yet. The pattern across the whole construction materials industry is similarly patchy. Redland tried to raise the price of concrete roofing tiles in January. Yesterday, Mr Gerald Corbett, the company's financial director, admitted that discounting was still going on, although volumes were up. Brick prices, which have fallen by a third over the past two years, remain depressed. Mr Michael Rose, managing director of Butterly Bricks of Ripley, Derbyshire, said: 'Stocks have peaked at record levels in the last few months.' Timber importers have tried to raise prices, spurred by the fall in the value of sterling as much as a desire to rebuild margins, but have so far failed. Mr Bruce Wright, finance director of London-based Meyer International, said: 'The sterling price of softwood is the same as it was 10 years ago.' Plywood and chipboard have fared a little better, helped by Japanese demand. Prices are 1 per cent to 2 per cent higher this year. Mr David Taylor, building materials analyst at stockbroker UBS, said that the PVC industry, which supplies piping and guttering, has also tried to raise prices without success. Plasterboard price rises in the first quarter had trouble in holding but since the end of March the increases have become more widespread. Knauf (UK), the Kent-based subsidiary of a German company increased prices by about 10 per cent on March 29. Mr Tony Galloni, marketing manager, said: 'It is too early to tell whether the new prices are holding.' Pilkington raised glass prices by 8 per cent in February and says the prices have held. The company said: 'The glass merchants are keen to see prices rises stick so they can raise their own margins.' Pilkington is also raising the price of insulation materials by between 7.5 per cent and 10 per cent from April 26. But the company acknowledged it has been 'very difficult to get these rises to stick in recent months'.</p>

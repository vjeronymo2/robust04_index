			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of Swiss Banking and Finance (5): Electronic trading approaches reality - The Stock Exchange THE Swiss stock exchanges finally seem to be near to the introduction of electronic trading. Mr Dieter Sigrist, secretary of the new Swiss Stock Exchange, says the current project for developing an electronic system is on schedule to be introduced in the spring of 1995. 'Both on the technical side and on the political side, we are on track,' Mr Sigrist said. This is a considerable achievement, considering the rough ride that Swiss banks and brokers have had in this area over the past few years. Plans for an electronic exchange in Switzerland were first outlined in the mid-1980s. At the time, seven bourses were operating in the country but intensifying competition from other European exchanges made the need to concentrate activity more pressing. However, given the strength of regional sentiment, it was unlikely that the others would willingly cede the field to the Zurich Borse, by far the largest of the Swiss exchanges. The creation of an electronic exchange provided an elegant way of avoiding loss of face as physical location would be irrelevant to such an exchange. Two attempts to create such a system were made in the 1980s, the more ambitious was designed by Andersen Consulting. But in late 1991, the project was suddenly scrapped. By then four of the seven exchanges had closed, leaving only Zurich, Geneva and Basle. Moreover, business was depressed and fixed commissions had just been abolished, leaving brokers uncertain about their future income. Many thought the Andersen project, which some said could cost more than SFr100m by the time it was installed, was extravagant. Andersen and the stock exchanges are still in court arguing over the consultants' fees, which are expected to be between SFr20m and SFr40m. To their credit, the exchanges went back to work to design a more modest system, and agreed on a plan that would be based on one developed for Australia's stock exchanges. Ironically, the Australian system had been based on one developed for the Swiss Options and Financial Futures Exchange (Soffex) in the early 1980s. The development budget is SFr80m and Mr Sigrist says about half of it has been spent to date. The system will handle trading and connect to the Swiss Clearing Corporation (SEGA) and the Swiss Interbank Clearing system (SIC) for processing settlements. In preparation for the launch of the electronic exchange, a number of organisational changes have taken place or are foreseen. First, a legal association called Swiss Stock Exchange (SSE) was established in May this year to take over responsibility for completing the exchange from the Association of Tripartite Bourses. It will also operate the exchange. Initially, only members of the three existing stock exchanges are SSE members and, for legal reasons, this is likely to prevail for the initial years of operation. Direct membership will become possible as soon as one of the three founding exchanges ceases operations, but that will only happen when the relevant canton agrees to give up its collection of taxes on securities transactions. SSE has already taken over responsibility for trading regulations and listings from the Association of Swiss Exchanges, which has been dissolved. Soffex, hitherto owned by the big banks and other exchange members, became a wholly owned subsidiary of SSE last month. One result of this move was that Soffex last summer dropped its plans for co-operating with other European futures exchanges. Instead, it will wait and develop an external policy together with the stock exchange. Another consequence is that the Soffex computer system will be transferred to a new computer complex that will be set up for the Swiss exchange. Meanwhile a new federal stock exchange law is being prepared to replace existing cantonal ones. It will probably not become fully effective until near the end of the decade and so the existing stock exchange entities and, more important, tax systems will remain in effect even after the electronic exchange has started to operate. For competitive reasons, the SSE wants to change from the cantonal volume-based tax to transaction ones, but Mr Sigrist does not see this happening until 1997 or later. The new federal law will probably leave most regulatory and surveillance matters to the SSE, at least at the initial stages, with final responsibility falling on the Federal Banking Commission. For example, a suspicion of insider trading would prompt the SSE to carry out an investigation and, if it was suspicious of wrongdoing, it would pass the case on to the commission. It has not yet been decided whether the SSE will build up its own surveillance staff or whether it will call upon companies' external auditors to carry out initial investigations. Mr Sigrist doubts that a big staff will be necessary because few cases will arise. He points out that there are only 55 members. The electronic exchange will collect data not only on the brokers carrying out transactions but also on whether deals are done for customers or for the broker's own account. The pace of implementation of electronic trading may seem painfully slow, but Mr Sigrist makes no apology. 'We have learned by spending a lot of money doing the wrong thing,' he says.</p>

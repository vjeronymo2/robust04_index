			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 6 (AFP)--China is "seriously  considering" Russian President Boris Yeltsin's call for an  international conference on the North Korean nuclear standoff, a  foreign ministry spokesman said Monday.    "China believes that the most practical and effective  framework so far for properly settling this issue is the  trilateral dialogue between the four parties" -- North and South  Korea, the United States and the International Atomic Energy  Agency [IAEA].    But nevertheless China would study seriously Moscow's call  for a multilateral conference, he added.    Since the North Korean nuclear crisis began about 18 months  ago, Beijing has refused to consider it an international issue  and has tried to block most initiatives taken within the United  Nations.    Instead China, which is Pyongyang's only ally, has pushed  for  the United States to talk directly with the communist regime in  the hope that this would eventually lead to Washington's  official recognition of Pyongyang.    In March, China snubbed a similar Russian call for a  multilateral conference because it countered its own efforts to  force the Americans to talk directly with Pyongyang.    The United States has called for sanctions against Pyongyang  following the IAEA report to the Security Council that it was  unable to verify whether North Korea removed plutonium from its  Yongbyon nuclear plant to make atomic weapons.    China, torn between its role as an international power and  its links with Pyongyang, may take advantage of the Russian  proposal to delay any UN vote on sanctions which would put it in  an embarrassing position, diplomatic sources said.</p>

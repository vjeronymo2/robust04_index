			<p><P> July 13, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> 2 CONVICTED OF MURDERING SYLMAR MAN  </P> <P> After a week of deliberations, a San Fernando Superior Court jury Wednesday  convicted two men of murdering a Sylmar man who was chaperoning a Sweet 16  party last year.  </P> <P> John Tanner, 23, of Lake View Terrace was found guilty of shooting John Shaw,  23. Jeffrey Evans, 24, of Lake View Terrace was found guilty of second-degree  murder for aiding and abetting Tanner.  </P> <P> But the jurors were still deliberating the charges against Dennis Elliot, 24,  of Pacoima, who prosecutors charge was involved in the quarrel that provoked  the shooting.  </P> <P> During the eight-week trial, Deputy Dist. Atty. Edward Nison argued that  Tanner, Evans and Elliot, who he said are gang members, approached Shaw as he  stood with other guests in front of the house in the 14900 block of Aztec  Street in Sylmar. Evans asked the party-goers if they were affiliated with  gangs. Shaw replied that he was not, which Tanner interpreted as a slight,  Nison said.  </P> <P> Tanner shot Shaw four or five times in the back and chest, he said.  </P> <P> Tanner testified he was asleep at home after drinking with friends all day when  the shooting took place.  </P> <P> Evans and Elliot also are charged with attempted murder in a drive-by shooting  involving a 20-year-old Pacoima man, Cedric Finley, in Lake View Terrace about  half an hour before the Sylmar killing. Finley was shot at four times but was  uninjured, Nison said.  </P> <P> The jury was still deliberating charges stemming from that shooting.  </P> <P> Sentencing for Tanner and Evans was set for Aug. 11. Both face a maximum  sentence of life imprisonment.  </P></p>

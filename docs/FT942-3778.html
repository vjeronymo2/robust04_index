			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / European Elections: Champagne corks pop in Walworth Rd There was elation at Labour's headquarters in London's Walworth Road early this morning. Volunteers uncorked champagne bottles as they analysed the results. Mr Larry Whitty, general secretary, said the results showed Labour doing 'substantially better than any of us expected'. Mr Whitty revealed that the party's eve-of-poll internal soundings had been showing Labour gaining a maximum of 50 to 55 seats. By early morning it was looking as if the party would go beyond 60. Mr Whitty had more than that to celebrate. He pointed to Labour victories right across the country, a virtual 'wipeout' of the Tory vote in London - and perhaps the most applauded result in the headquarters all evening - the capture of Essex Man deep in the Tory heartlands. Among those milling around Walworth Road was the shadow secretary to the Treasury, Ms Harriet Harman, anxious to make sure that her comments for the evening would be overheard by the Financial Times: 'What the people of Essex have said is that they don't believe that the Tories represent the party of low tax any more. Now Essex Man and Woman have turned to Labour.' Among the many results striking a particularly poignant note for the gathered party activists was the election of Mr Neil Kinnock's wife Glenys as a Euro MP. Her celebration speech was a striking contrast to the Glenys Kinnock who stood outside the same building during the last general election tearfully recording the national humiliation of her husband. It was left to Mr Frank Dobson, transport spokesman, to contribute his joke for the evening amidst the euphoria. Gleefully watching the Conservative rout on the television, Mr Dobson said: 'It is a real record-breaking night for John Major. In fact it is like Brian Lara in reverse - he is breaking so many records.'</p>

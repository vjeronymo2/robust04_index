			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> 14. A new &sect;86.004&hyph;28 is added to subpart A to read as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=4 --> &sect;86.004&hyph;28  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=4 --> Compliance with emission standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Section 86.004&hyph;28 includes text that specifies requirements that differ from &sect;&sect;86.094&hyph;28 and 86.098&hyph;28. Where a paragraph in &sect;86.094&hyph;28 or &sect;86.098&hyph;28 is identical and applicable to &sect;86.001&hyph;28, this may be indicated by specifying the corresponding paragraph and the statement ``[Reserved]. For guidance see &sect;86.094&hyph;28.'' or ``[Reserved]. For guidance see &sect;86.098&hyph;28.''.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a)(1) [Reserved].

For guidance see &sect;86.094&hyph;28.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)(1) Paragraph (b) of this section applies to light-duty trucks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Each exhaust, evaporative and refueling emission standard (and family emission limits, as appropriate) of &sect;86.004&hyph;9 applies to the emissions of vehicles for the appropriate useful life as defined in &sect;&sect;86.098&hyph;2 and 86.001&hyph;9.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)(3) through (b)(6) [Reserved]. For guidance see &sect;86.094&hyph;28.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)(7)(i) Paragraph (b)(7) of this section describes the procedure for determining compliance of a new vehicle with evaporative emission standards. The procedure described here shall be used for all vehicles in applicable model years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The manufacturer shall determine, based on testing described in &sect;86.001&hyph;21(b)(4)(i)(A), and supply an evaporative emission deterioration factor for each evaporative/refueling emission family-emission control system combination. The factor shall be calculated by subtracting the emission level at the selected test point from the emission level at the useful life point.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) The official evaporative emission test results for each evaporative/refueling emission-data vehicle at the selected test point shall be adjusted by the addition of the appropriate deterioration factor. However, if the deterioration factor supplied by the manufacturer is less than zero, it shall be zero for the purposes of this paragraph.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) The emission value to compare with the standards shall be the adjusted emission value of paragraph (b)(7)(iii) of this section rounded to two significant figures in accordance with ASTM E 29&hyph;67 (reapproved 1980) (as referenced in &sect;86.094&hyph;28(a)(4)(i)(B)( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> )( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ii <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> )) for each evaporative emission-data vehicle.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8)(i) Paragraph (b)(8) of this section describes the procedure for determining compliance of a new vehicle with refueling emission standards. The procedure described here shall be used for all applicable vehicles in the applicable model years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The manufacturer shall determine, based on testing described in &sect;86.098&hyph;21(b)(4)(i)(B), and supply a refueling emission deterioration factor for each evaporative/refueling emission family-emission control system combination. The factor shall be calculated by subtracting the emission level at the selected test point from the emission level at the useful life point.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) The official refueling emission test results for each evaporative/refueling emission-data vehicle at the selected test point shall be adjusted by the addition of the appropriate deterioration factor. However, if the deterioration factor supplied by the manufacturer is less than zero, it shall be zero for the purposes of this paragraph.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) The emission value to compare with the standards shall be the adjusted emission value of paragraph (b)(8)(iii) of this section rounded to two significant figures in accordance with ASTM E 29&hyph;67 (reapproved 1980) (as referenced in &sect;86.094&hyph;28 (a)(4)(i)(B)( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> )( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ii <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> )) for each evaporative emission-data vehicle.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (9) Every test vehicle of an engine family must comply with all applicable standards (and family emission limits, as appropriate), as determined in &sect;86.094&hyph;28(b)(4)(iv) and paragraphs (b)(7)(iv) and (b)(8)(iv) of this section, before any vehicle in that family will be certified.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) through (d) [Reserved].

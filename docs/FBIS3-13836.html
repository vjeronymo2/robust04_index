Despite some positive points in this resolution, the way  that  the United States voted on some of its paragraphs, not to  mention the U.S. obstruction of the Security Council for  approximately three weeks, revealed the U.S. Administration's  true position and confirmed that this U.S. Administration holds  a greater bias toward Israel than that of former U.S.  Administrations.    The comments made by the U.S. representative at the Security  Council, after this resolution was passed, are perhaps the  clearest example of this extreme U.S. bias toward Israel,  especially since she announced that her country does not regard  the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, and Arab Jerusalem as occupied  territories, so, according to her, they are not covered under  the Fourth Geneva Convention concerning the situation of  civilians at wartime.    Given this, and in view of this extremely biased U.S.  position, we do not need to wonder whether Washington is  entitled to play an honest broker role in the Middle East  conflict. We do, however, wonder about another doubtful issue:  Will the new Security Council resolution be implemented on the  ground, particularly regarding international protection for  Palestinians, as long as the Clinton administration, which is  facing a domestic crisis, flatters both Israel and its U.S.  friends in this manner?    While not wishing to focus any more attention on this  extremely negative U.S. position toward an important aspect of  the Middle East conflict; namely, Arab Jerusalem, we do hope  that the recent Security Council resolution will be translated  into tangible results. We wish to see results that will help  open the door wide to the resumption of the peace process and  help make the desired changes in the lives of the citizens in  the occupied Palestinian territory.</p>

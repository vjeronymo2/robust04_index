			<p>BFN     [Text] A new party named Main Path Party [MPP] [Anayol  Partisi] has been established. The petition on the  establishment of the new party was submitted to the Interior  Ministry Secretariat General by Gurcan Baser on behalf of the  founders council. The party has 31 founding members.    [Begin recording] [Correspondent Burak Gercek] Different  scenarios have recently been proposed with regard to our  political life. The most talked-about proposal consists of the  unification of the True Path Party [TPP] and the Motherland  Party [ANAP] under the Main Path banner. This was realized  today, but only in name. The participants are different. We are  now asking MPP founding leader Baser why they chose this name.    [Baser] We used our right as citizens and 31 of us  established a party in line with the Political Parties Law. In  our country, division in the political spectrum demonstrates the  governments' inability, rather than their strength. It will be  beneficial for the parties with similar platforms -- the party  in power and the main opposition party -- to integrate. We are  inviting all parties with similar platforms to unite under our  roof.    [Gercek] Whereabouts in the political spectrum are you  situated?    [Baser] Free economy and Ataturk nationalism. I believe  that these two phrases are sufficient.</p>

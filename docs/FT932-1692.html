			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / Survey of Power for Europe (14): A shareholding workforce - Privatisation has altered the corporate culture WALK INTO the headquarters of the 16 privatised electricity generating and distribution companies in the UK and you will soon see a television screen relaying the latest share prices in the sector. The information on the screens is in constant demand from senior executives to the humblest employees, nearly all of whom still have shares in their company bought at privatisation. Employees tend to know how their company and its rivals are faring on the stock market. According to industry executives the screens and the interest shown in them symbolise a cultural transformation which is producing a more competitive atmosphere than before privatisation. The claims are exaggerated but there have been significant changes. Electricity companies have become more outward looking and more focused on what they should and should not be doing. Although they are constantly attacked for making excessive profits - or rather the government is attacked for permitting them to do so - the standard of their service has not become a significant issue as it did for BT, after the telephone system was privatised. According to Mr Stephen Littlechild, the industry regulator, companies have more than met the standards he has laid down. These include guaranteeing that electricity must be restored within 24 hours of a supply fault and replacing a company fuse within four hours. A source of friction with poorer customers has been reduced by the 62 per cent drop in the number of disconnections in Britain. The City approves such improvements - largely because it means there is also less friction with the regulator - but it is much more interested in how the companies are raising their efficiency to influence profits. Critics of privatisation feel that job cutting is viewed in the City almost as a virility symbol. Thus Eastern Electricity, the largest company, was marked down until recently because some analysts viewed its management as too slow to reduce its workforce. Its shares perked up this year following a job shedding announcement. Few companies have matched the job cutting rate of National Power. Staff numbers there have been reduced from 17,000 at privatisation three years ago to less than 7,400 today. The effect on profits has been dramatic, according to Mr John Baker, chief executive. Productivity in the last year, when jobs have been reduced by 4,000, has risen by 25 per cent and salary costs by 12 per cent. Mr Baker says this would not have been achievable if the company was still in the public sector. 'Management would have been invited to back pedal in the interests of political stability. In the new climate the unions have been exceedingly constructive. It is a different culture.' PowerGen, the other generator, is down to 4,900 staff from 9,000 three years ago. Regional companies have been cutting too but less savagely, they argue, because they had less fat. Midlands Electricity is typical having cut about 800 jobs from more than 8,000. In cutting such large numbers electricity companies have taken active steps to avoid alienating those that are left. South West Electricity, for example, hired Charles Smith Associates, a management consultancy which helped Rover improve its staff morale. Performance related pay is also being introduced. For example, Seeboard recently concluded a deal for more flexible working and performance pay with retail staff. Some companies are also hoping to motivate staff by making down-line managers more profit-oriented. East Midlands electricity recently rationalised 13 so-called cost centres into seven 'profit centres'. Headquarters staff is being cut accordingly. In introducing all of these changes companies have been helped by a stream of healthy profits - some recs almost doubled profits in 1991-2 and are showing healthy rises last year. This in turn has enabled salaries to remain high. The exceptions are retail and electrical contracting employees who have seen their salaries fall as management have brought salary structures in line with the market. Elsewhere higher than average salary rises have been common. This year, at a time when public sector rises have been restricted to 1.5 per cent, electricity workers have enjoyed rises above that, and in some cases above 4 per cent. But the biggest financial gainers have been the senior executives. Most chairmen and chief executives of regional electricity companies earned between Pounds 50,000 and Pounds 70,000 before privatisation and between Pounds 150,000 and Pounds 200,000 a year later and significant increases have followed. If the rises continued last year - they will be revealed in annual reports in the next few months - the Labour Party, which opposed privatisation, and others are likely to make political capital.</p>

Applicant proposes to conduct the activities on a world-wide basis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Closely Related to Banking Standard <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act provides that a bank holding company may, with Board approval, engage in any activity ``that the Board after due notice and opportunity for hearing has determined (by order or regulation) to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto''. In determining whether a proposed activity is closely related to banking for purposes of the BHC Act, the Board considers,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> inter alia <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , the matters set forth in National Courier Association v. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 516 F.2d 1229 (D.C. Cir. 1975). These considerations are: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Whether banks generally have in fact provided the proposed services, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Whether banks generally provide services that are operationally or functionally so similar to the proposed services as to equip them particularly well to provide the proposed services; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Whether banks generally provide services that are so integrally related to the proposed services as to require their provision in a specialized form.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  516 F.2d at 1237. In addition, the Board may consider any other basis that may demonstrate that the activity has a reasonable or close relationship to banking or managing or controlling banks.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Board Statement Regarding Regulation Y <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 49 FR 806 (1984).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applicant maintains that the Board previously has determined by order that the proposed activities, when conducted within the limitations established by the Board, are closely related to banking and consistent with section 20 of the Glass-Steagall Act (12 U.S.C. 377).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See, e.g., Citicorp <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 73 Federal Reserve Bulletin 473 (1987),  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> aff'd sub nom.

In particular, Applicant maintains that the proposal will enhance competition and result in greater convenience to Applicant's customers. In addition, Applicant states that the proposed activities will not result in adverse effects such as an undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interests, or unsound banking practices, and that Company will conduct the proposed activities in accordance with prudential limitations designed to safeguard against such potential adverse effects that have been relied upon by the Board in similar previous cases.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See, e.g., Citicorp, supra; The Sanwa Bank, Limited, supra. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In this regard, Applicant has requested that one of the prudential limitations be modified to permit one officer or one director of one of its United States banking affiliates to serve as a director of Company, a modification which Applicant maintains is consistent with prior Board actions.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See, e.g., Synovus Financial Corp., et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 77 Federal Reserve Bulletin 954 (1991). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In publishing the proposal for comment, the Board does not take a position on issues raised by the proposal. Notice of the proposal is published solely in order to seek the views of interested persons on the issues presented by the application, and does not represent a determination by the Board that the proposal meets or is likely to meet the standards of the BHC Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any comments or requests for hearing should be submitted in writing and received by William W. Wiles, Secretary, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, D.C. 20551, not later than January 26, 1994. Any request for a hearing on this application must, as required by section 262.3(e) of the Board's Rules of Procedure (12 CFR 262.3(e)), be accompanied by a statement of the reasons why a written presentation would not suffice in lieu of a hearing, identifying specifically any questions of fact that are in dispute, summarizing the evidence that would be presented at a hearing, and indicating how the party commenting would be aggrieved by approval of the proposal. This application may be inspected at the offices of the Board of Governors or the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, December 30, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Jennifer J.

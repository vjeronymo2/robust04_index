			<p>BFN     [Text] Cape Town June 8 SAPA -- The Frontline States are to  send a task force to Lesotho to quote "knock some sense" into  the elements disrupting the country, Frontline Chairman and  Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe said on Wednesday.    Speaking at a late night press conference attended by  President Nelson Mandela, Namibian head of state Sam Nujoma and  President Ali Hassan Mwinyi of Tanzania, he said the task force  would try to interact with those who were disturbing democracy  in the mountain kingdom.    It would also warn them that if they persisted in their  actions, the Frontline States would "go further than just the  political act of sending a task force". Military action was  "not excluded but for now it has not been decided on".    Mr Mandela said the Frontline States had no desire to engage  in any action offensive to the international and regional  organisations whose opinions it valued. "We must understand  this as an attempt to preserve democracy within the parameters  of consultation with all parties that are involved. We are  committed to methods of peaceful persuasion in addressing  problems generally and in particular with regard to Lesotho."    President Mugabe said the task force had already met and  would leave as soon as its members had "put their thoughts  together" under the terms of reference given to them. They  would report back as soon as possible.    Whatever action was finally taken would be on a joint basis  and would not be just the action of an individual Frontline  country.    President Mugabe said he and his Frontline colleagues on  Wednesday discussed a report compiled by a task force appointed  earlier this year on the situation in Lesotho and felt "very,  very disturbed". The situation there was deteriorating by the  day and the government was unable to perform its functions  freely because of interference by elements in both the army and  the police force.    "In view of that worsening situation, we have decided that  we  will certainly set up another task force which will go back to  Lesotho and try to knock some sense into those elements of the  forces, whether it is police or army who are interfering with  the smooth running of governmental activity and actually causing  the lawlessness currently taking place in that country." He  regarded this as "stern action".    The task force would "enjoin them, urge them, encourage them  and actually warn them that if they persist in their actions, we  will go further than just the political act of sending a task  force. "We would set a very dangerous precedent if, in a region  where democracy is the order of the day, and where it is not the  order of the day, is being established...we allowed its reversal  by forces which are bent on lawlessness, and disorder."    President Mugabe said the first task force which represented  only Botswana, Zimbabwe and South Africa, had made  recommendations to Lesotho, including restructuring of the army  to incorporate guerrillas from the Lesotho Liberation Army.  However, sections of the army had prevented the government from  implementing the reforms.    Representatives of Botswana, Lesotho and Zambia were also  present at the press conference.</p>

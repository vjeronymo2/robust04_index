			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The final rule adopted the consensus agreements reached by the industry in the Working Groups, with only slight modifications. Sections 284.8(b)(5) and 284.9(b)(4) require pipelines to provide standardized information relating to firm and interruptible service on their EBBs and to provide users with the ability to download the standardized information in compliance with standardized procedures and protocols. The rule provides that the details of the required information, procedures, and protocols will be made available in a document entitled ``Standardized Data Sets and Communication Protocols,'' which will be available at the Commission's Public Reference and Files Maintenance Branch. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The standardized data sets specify the information concerning capacity availability that pipelines must provide both on their on-line EBBs and through downloadable files. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  This information includes offers to sell firm capacity (either by the pipeline or releasing shippers), bids for capacity, awards of capacity, withdrawals of capacity offers and bids, operationally available ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  interruptible) and unsubscribed firm capacity, and system-wide notices. In addition, the Commission established a mechanism for creating a common code data base for identifying pipeline transaction points, such as receipt and delivery points. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> On-line EBB refers to a continuous computer connection between a pipeline EBB and a user's computer in which the information from the pipeline's computer is displayed visually on the user's computer and the user can enter data directly to the pipeline's computer. File downloading refers to the transfer, in computerized format, of a file from the pipeline's computer to the user's computer. The user then can use other computer programs to manipulate the data off-line when it is not connected to the pipeline's computer. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The communication protocols establish principles and procedures relating to the operation of pipeline EBBs and the provision of downloadable files to users. The most important of these protocols is the requirement that the pipelines provide downloadable files that conform to the standards for Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) promulgated by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Accredited Standards Committee (ASC) X12. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In addition to EDI, the Commission had required the pipelines to provide for file downloads in a standardized ASCII flat file format, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  but the Commission is deleting this requirement on rehearing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> ASC X12 standards provide an electronic data submission capability that allows computers to exchange information over communication lines using standardized formats. Since the ASC X12 transaction sets provide generic data groups applicable to a range of potential applications, the transaction sets must be customized to individual applications by correlating or ``mapping'' the specific information to an ASC X12 transaction set through an implementation guide. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> ASCII refers to the American Standard Code for Information Interchange, a code for character representation. ASC X12 downloads also use ASCII characters. The term ASCII flat file download refers to a standardized file download capability that does not meet the requirements of the ASC X12 standards. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the rule, the Commission recognized that as pipelines began the process of implementing the data sets, they could discover problems requiring modifications. The Commission stated that pipelines should communicate any problems to the Working Groups, which should make the necessary modifications to the data set and submit them to the Commission in sufficient time to permit implementation of the requirements by June 1, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On March 4, 1994, Working Groups 1 &amp; 2 filed revised capacity release data sets and an implementation guide for downloading these data sets using EDI. Public notice was given of the filing with an opportunity for comments. By order dated April 1, 1994, the Commission accepted the revised data sets and implementation guide. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 59 FR 16537 (Apr. 7, 1994), 67 FERC &para; 61,006 (1994). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The initial Working Group reports included a number of issues on which the Working Groups had not yet reached agreement. In the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR), the Commission concluded that the Working Groups should take more time to consider these issues and try to reach consensus. The Commission provided that the Working Groups submit reports on these matters to the Commission by February 1, 1994. In Order No. 563, the Commission found that resolution of these issues should await the February 1, 1994 reports. Nevertheless, many of the requests for rehearing and clarification address the same issues. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission has received a number of reports from the Working Groups, which were publicly noticed with an opportunity for comments. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  When appropriate, the Commission will address these issues in this order to provide the Working Groups with guidance as to how to proceed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Working Groups 1 &amp; 2 could not reach consensus on several issues, and submitted reports from participants on the following issues: proposals for electronic index of purchasers which would provide information about the capacity rights of firm shippers, position papers on whether to require disclosure of aggregate firm and interruptible nominations at pipeline points, and position papers on the methods for recovering electronic communication costs. Working Group 5 submitted reports on a consensus agreement for implementing a common code for company names. Working Group 4 submitted a final report on communication protocols and operational logistics. Working Group 3 submitted a report containing a proposal for implementing standards for nominations and confirmations and a schedule for developing standards for other business transactions. Several participants also submitted position papers on the issue of ASCII flat file downloads. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission will address the issues raised by the rehearing requests in the following areas: data set implementation and maintenance; specific information included, or proposed to be included, in the data sets (operationally available capacity, unsubscribed firm capacity, and firm and interruptible flowing volume); electronic communication issues (ASCII flat file downloads, file uploads, and subset downloads); common codes for companies and gas transaction points; additional standards for an Index of Purchasers and non-capacity business transactions; and proposals relating to the method for recovering the costs for implementing standards. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

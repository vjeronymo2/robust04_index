			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / International Company News: Paramount Communications Shares in Paramount Communications tumbled yesterday as it emerged that far more investors had tendered their shares in support of the Viacom bid for the company than the competing, higher one from QVC, writes Richard Waters in New York. Both bids have been extended by two days, pending a court decision on a legal challenge mounted by QVC. Viacom said 12.3m shares in Paramount had been tendered in support of its bid, equivalent to 10.5 per cent of the company. QVC, on the other hand, said 209,829 shares had been tendered for its offer, equal to 0.2 per cent of Paramount's shares. On Wall Street, Paramount closed Dollars 2 1/2 lower at Dollars 76 1/2 . Paramount Communications and AT&amp;T announced plans yesterday to develop pilot interactive television programmes for broadcast in the US. Paramount will use AT&amp;T software to put together interactive versions of two popular US television programmes, one on entertainment and the other on sports, which can be delivered over cable TV systems, telephone lines or satellite links.</p>

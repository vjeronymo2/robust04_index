			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> TEACHERS RESPOND ON TORRANCE TESTS  </P> <P> Teachers believe the article "Torrance Teachers, Parents at Odds Over Returning  Tests to Students," which ran on the South Bay pages on Nov. 4, did not  adequately present our position.  </P> <P> Returning tests to students is not the issue. Of course we return tests and go  over them thoroughly with our students. It is an essential part of the learning  process.  </P> <P> The issue is whether there should be a requirement that all tests leave the  classroom with the students.  </P> <P> What would be gained? A few of the tests might make it home to the parents for  discussion.  </P> <P> What would be lost? The students' chance to test themselves against materials  developed by textbook publishers for use nationwide. If the tests left the  classroom, it would breach security commitments made by users of the tests to  these publishers.  </P> <P> Cheating is a serious problem. We would not want to inadvertently reward those  who have access to previously administered tests, rather than an understanding  of the subject.  </P> <P> Countless hours of teacher time would be lost. We attempt to devise tests that  challenge students with higher levels of critical thinking and analysis -- not  just rote learning.  </P> <P> These tests are extremely difficult to devise -- impossible, in fact, if we  have to start from scratch every time. Questions often need several revisions  to most effectively measure understanding of the texts and other classroom  content. If we could afford to change texts more often, perhaps this would be a  less serious problem.  </P> <P> But the most damaging -- absolutely crucial -- aspect of this lost time would  be the cost to other essential parts of the teacher's job, including classroom  preparation and responding to students' writing.  </P> <P> Parents should be involved in their children's education. We have encouraged  parental help in our summer reading program and in a tutorial center we are  establishing.  </P> <P> There are many other ways parents have supported and can support the schools,  but analyzing responses to a test without knowing the instructional context  could only be useful if it is in conference with the teacher involved.  </P> <P> We are deeply concerned about how to help our students and use a broad range of  assessment techniques. Tests play only a part in this process and should not  become the focus rather than the learning itself.  </P> <P> For those parents who are sincerely concerned about going over a test with a  teacher and find it impossible to meet during the day, we've found that a phone  conversation can clear up most questions.  </P> <P> We as teachers have been creating quality education in Torrance for a number of  years and welcome all who share our commitment. However, we believe this  requirement would be both divisive and counterproductive.  </P> <P> MARGARET HARRELL,  </P> <P> English and social studies teacher,  </P> <P> West High  </P> <P> BRENDA McNAMARA,  </P> <P> social studies department  </P> <P> chairwoman, West High  </P> <P> LARRY LORENZ,  </P> <P> social studies department  </P> <P> chairman, South High  </P> <P> CARL STRONG,  </P> <P> social studies department  </P> <P> chairman, Torrance High  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Political Editor Chip Tsao, and Stacy Mosher] </F>   [Text] Any change to the law on land inheritance in the  New Territories will be reversed after the 1997 handover, a  senior Chinese official in Beijing told EASTERN EXPRESS last  night. He was responding to the row over proposals initiated by  a legislative councillor, Christine Loh, to give women the right  to inherit property in the New Territories.    "Article 40 of the Basic Law stipulates that the lawful  traditional rights and interests of the indigenous inhabitants  of the New Territories shall be protected," the Chinese official  said. "Loh's amendment to the laws governing indigenous  inheritance right is supported by the Hong Hong government. It  is intended to be divisive, instigating internal struggle among  Hong Kong people. Loh's amendment undermines Hong Kong's  stability. It is deceptive as it calls for sexual equality.  The future Hong Kong government will act in accordance with the  Basic Law but not follow things set out by them (Loh and the  Government)."    A senior Hong Kong government official criticised the  warning. "Nobody has the right to prejudge the SAR [special  administrative region] legislature," he said. "It is a part of  autonomy enjoyed by the future SAR under the Joint Declaration.  Chairman Mao Zedong said: `Women hold up half the sky'."    Simon Li, a retired high court judge and former member of  the  Basic Law drafting committee and current Preliminary Working  Committee member, said the rights of the New Territories'  indigenous people were secured by the Joint Declaration and  "nothing in this world is equal". Li said Loh's visit to the  New Territories villages was undemocratic. "In the old days,  when Emperor Chin visited a place, he used to be escorted by a  hundred carriages," Li said. "Now some democratic legislators  have to be protected by 400 policemen."    Heung Yee Kuk members agreed to form a "Headquarters for the  Struggle to Protect Home and Tribe" after a meeting yesterday  discussing Loh's amendment to the New Territories Land  (Exemption) Bill. Members vowed to pursue their campaign by  peaceful means.    Attention has focused on the Fanling village of Lung Yeuk  Tau  and the Sha Tin village of Kak Tin in preparation for today's  visit by Loh's subcommittee on women's affairs to exchange views  with villagers on inheritance laws and women's rights. Earlier  this week nearly 1,000 villagers rallied outside Legco [the  Legislative Council] to protest against Loh's proposal. A  United Democrats legislator, Lee Wing-tat, was assaulted and  demonstrators supporting the amendment reported being attacked.  Loh was the target of verbal fury, with some saying that she  would be "raped and buried" if she set foot in the New  Territories. Police declined to confirm rumours that hundreds  of uniformed officers will be deployed to maintain order during  the visit.</p>

			<p><P> May 12, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> 'EARTH GIRLS': THROUGH THE EYES OF EXTRATERRESTRIALS  </P> <P> "Earth Girls Are Easy" (citywide) takes place in Los Angeles, but it's L.A.  through cracked sunglasses with purple stardust frizzies on the lens.  </P> <P> The movie is a jazzy, snazzy rock-musical comedy about a dumped-on Valley Girl  who ushers three girl-crazy extraterrestrials around town after they crash-land  in her swimming pool. And its virtuoso director, Julien Temple ("Absolute  Beginners"), turns Los Angeles into a candy-frosted, slick dream mall, where  Melrose Avenue, the San Fernando Valley and Ocean Avenue seem to have swallowed  up everything.  </P> <P> The city is creamed over visually with Temple's wit and impudence. He's like a  guy who dreamed up Los Angeles out of TV and movies and then went out and found  all the places he dreamed: found the nutty drive-ins, goofball specialty shops,  the huge plaster doughnuts, the palm trees slashing the smoggy sky. He's even  found Angelyne, the puffy-bosomed blonde in lavender sunglasses whose only  raison d'etre seemed to be her omnipresent L.A. billboards -- she pops up here  as a sultry bimbo in a BMW.  </P> <P> It's the look of the movie, supposedly filtered through alien eyes, that's  special. But the core of "Earth Girls" is too easy: slick fluff that's been  ingeniously lacquered over, a mix of Valley Girl shop-and-chop sarcasm and  cutie-pie sci-fi effects with the laid-back, benignly trashy mood of an old  beach party musical.  </P> <P> The script and four songs were co-written by Julie Brown, MTV's resident  put-down specialist, as a vehicle for herself. Instead, Brown's part, Valerie  the dippy manicurist, went to Geena Davis, with Brown recast as her girlfriend,  boss of the Curl Up and Dye hair salon. The rest of the cast is equally  anachronistic: Michael McKean as a burnt-out surfer and pool cleaner; Jeff  Goldblum, Jim Carrey and Damon Wayans as the aliens from Jhazzalan, and  ex-"Saturday Night Live" bad-mouth Charlie Rocket, as Valerie's faithless  boyfriend, looking something like Dan Quayle as a sour-faced yuppie swinger.  </P> <P> Brown's songs are cute; as Temple stages and shoots them, they're the high  spots of the movie. But the movie is a weird hybrid. The visual satire is  ingenious and even entrancing, like an old '50s Frank Tashlin comedy or a  musical number by Stanley Donen and Bob Fosse. But the verbal humor has a mean,  sluggy tartness, like the condescending cracks of rich kids at the hicko  culture of the local styleless boobs.  </P> <P> Temple has a weakness for this kind of humor; he's a wealthy Cambridge boy who  must have liked the punks and rockers for their freedom and contempt for  authority. But, sometimes, he seems to lack the real populist flair that a  pop-music specialist needs, and this may be why, except for his superb rock  videos, he hasn't caught the public fancy yet.  </P> <P> In the end, though, the visuals triumph. "Earth Girls Are Easy" may be a  classic case of a director getting more out of his material than it really  deserves. Temple has spectacular gifts for making musical movies. He is a witty  formalist, a light-hearted virtuoso, and, like all the best movie-musical  directors, he's able to create images that breathe in tempo with the songs or  cut against them jaggedly, exhilaratingly.  </P> <P> There is one terrific example of that here: " 'Cause I'm a Blonde," a  bimbos-on-the-beach satirical number in which Julie Brown redeems herself for  all the script's lazy one-liners and its paucity of invention and real style.  She gives the number a languorous, wooly-headed self-infatuated buzz, and  Temple makes the air around her crackle. "Earth Girls Are Easy" (MPAA rated PG,  despite sexual innuendo and partial nudity) may be the weakest piece of  material Temple has had to work with, but he transforms it anyway. In his  hands, the whole style of this movie becomes an apotheosis of glitz.MICHAEL  WILMINGTON  </P></p>

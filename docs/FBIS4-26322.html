			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Danielle Yang] </F>   [Text] Taipei, June 20 (CNA) -- Taiwan imported U.S.$33.64  million worth of auto parts and components from Europe in the  first quarter of this year, up 52 percent from the same period  of 1993, according to statistics released by the Ministry of  Economic Affairs Monday [20 June].    During the three-month period, imports of stainless steel  increased the most of any European import over last year's first  quarter, growing 180 percent, followed by a jump in machinery  imports of 65 percent, the statistics showed.    However, Taiwan's exports to Europe mostly declined during  the January-March period. Toys and recreational equipment  registered the largest decline of 25.9 percent to total only  U.S.$113.98 million. Plastic product exports decreased 22.1  percent, and bicycle exports fell 1.8 percent.    Meanwhile, Taiwan's exports to the European Union alone  decreased during the first five months of 1994, but increased to  those European countries that are not part of the EU, data  compiled by the Euro-Asia Trade Organization (EATO) showed.    Taiwan exports to the EU totaled U.S.$4.619 billion, down 7  percent, while exports to non-EU European countries totaled  U.S.$716.1 million, up 5 percent from the same period of 1993.    Among EU countries, exports to Ireland grew 19.6 percent,  exports to Denmark increased 9.8 percent, and exports to Britain  increased 2 percent, according to the EATO data.

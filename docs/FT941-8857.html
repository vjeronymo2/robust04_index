			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / International Company News: Sumitomo Chemical in Y9bn loss Sumitomo Chemical, the large Japanese chemicals company, yesterday posted its first non-consolidated operating loss, demonstrating the depth of the crisis afflicting the industry in Japan. The company halved its full-year dividend to Y3 per share. Sumitomo forecast static sales this financial year and would make no profit on the operating, pre-tax or post-tax lines. The group warned it would need to sell securities worth Y10bn (Dollars 96m) this year for its operating profits to break even. The group, the first of the big Japanese chemicals companies to report full-year results, reported a loss of Y9.7bn for the year to December 31, compared with a profit of Y7.4bn in 1992. Consolidated pre-tax profits fell 18.6 per cent from Y40.3bn to Y32.8bn. Consolidated operating profits fell from Y53bn to Y36.8bn. The consolidated results, which were achieved on sales down 8 per cent from Y1,018bn to Y936bn, were flattered by a number of exceptional factors. These included a gain of Y22.7bn on sales of securities, and Y5.7bn on the sale of property in Osaka. There were no such gains in 1992. Sumitomo also made provisions of Y15.6bn for currency losses, bad debts, topping up the pension fund and the cost of disposing of plants. That compared with similar charges in 1992 of Y4.7bn. Post-tax earnings fell from Y16.3bn to Y12.8bn. The tax charge fell from Y23.9bn to Y20bn. Earnings per share fell from Y10.09 to Y7.87. The company forecast consolidated sales of Y960bn this year, generating operating profits of Y40bn, pre-tax profits of Y27bn and post-tax earnings of Y11bn.</p>

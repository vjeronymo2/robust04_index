			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Peter Scherer report: "RAF Split?"] </F>   [Text] Frankfurt/Main -- "Currently profound developments  are taking place" in German left-wing extremist terrorism. This  is revealed by an analysis of the current situation by the  Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution [BfV], in  which the authority points in particular to important changes in  the situation within the terrorist Red Army Faction (RAF). The  RAF is entangled so much in quarrels about its direction that  there has even been a split of the militant extremist  organization, the BfV report says. Its so-far stable structure  -- a complex construct consisting of the so-called command  echelon, the "prisoners' collective," and about 250 supporters,  the "RAF scene" -- has "broken apart."    Links between members of the RAF scene and the also  left-wing  extremist Workers Party of Kurdistan (PKK) are known. Thus, the  authorities noted recently that an activist who belongs to the  RAF scene participated in a "leading function" in a  PKK-controlled Kurdish solidarity rally in Bonn. At a meeting  of the Hanns-Seidel Foundation in Budapest, BfV Vice President  Frisch discussed the "international ties" of the RAF scene.  There he cited the "participation in demonstrations against the  PKK ban and the trips of some members of the RAF scene to  Turkey."    However, Frisch did not talk about PKK support by the RAF  command echelon or of a "massive, in particular logistical  support," the BfV said, correcting corresponding media reports  yesterday.    The RAF has further expanded its contacts and its ties with  other European terrorist groups. This also applies to its links  with the banned Turkish extremist organization "Devrimci Sol"  (Revolutionary Left [Dev Sol]). In the meantime, the "Dev Sol"  has even been integrated in the "SpinnenNetz" [CobWeb] mailbox  system, which was started in 1991 -- an information and  leadership instrument of the inner RAF scene, which is  camouflaged as an "information shop" of the "antifascist action."</p>

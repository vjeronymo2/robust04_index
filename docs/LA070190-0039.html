			<p><P> July 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONLY IN PARIS, DARLING!  </P> <P> In Horace Sutton's article, "Manhattan's Times Square Boasts Another  Enthusiastic Renaissance," June 10, he mentions a restaurant "run by one of the  adopted sons of Josephine Baker, darling of Paris and New York City in the  '20s."  </P> <P> Baker certainly was the darling of Paris, and all of France, after going there  in a black revue late in the '20s, but she was never the darling of New York  City, even on her infrequent returns. I lived in New York City in the '20s, and  for many decades thereafter. I think I know more about that city than Sutton  will ever learn.  </P> <P> GABRIEL FURLONG  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

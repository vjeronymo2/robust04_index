			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / MMM case makes Russia revise share rules: Imminent collapse of pyramid scheme exposes failure of government regulation The Russian government yesterday said it would devise rules to regulate share trading, as the country's best known company, the MMM finance house, tottered on the verge of a collapse which would ruin the dreams of large numbers of its shareholders. They are unlikely to be compensated, certainly not in full, if the pyramid investment organisation collapses - though Mr Sergei Dubinin, the acting finance minister, has been put in charge of a committee which will see what can be done. The cabinet meeting called to consider the crisis at MMM - which now has an estimated 20,000 people waiting around its Moscow headquarters to trade in their shares - heard an astonishing litany of government insouciance in the face of MMM's activities. By their own account, ministers and senior officials had allowed a company to continue trading which broke a number of existing laws every day of its operation. It had not paid Rbs49.9bn of tax and had not maintained or shown to the authorities proper records, according to Mr Vladimir Gusev, head of the taxation service. It continued to sell shares through a company named Russia House Selengha, despite a ban on such trading by the supreme arbitration court. It has also, according to Mr Gusev, not registered itself with the finance ministry, in spite of a law which obliges all companies which issue more than Rbs1bn of shares to do so, and in spite of government estimates that it sold Rbs4bn of shares each day, according to Mr Andrei Vavilov, the first deputy finance minister. Nor has it responded to requests from the anti-trust committee for interviews, according to Mr Leonid Bochin, head of the anti-trust committee Mr Oleg Soskovets, first deputy prime minister, criticised officials for splitting up control of the securities market and thus confusing the issue. The huge crowd of people round its headquarters swelled overnight - though the crowd appeared relatively peaceful in the warm Moscow sun. Touts were passing through the crowd offering around Rbs80,000-Rbs90,000 for MMM shares as the black market price rose from around Rbs40,000-Rbs50,000 after company spokesmen promised that the buying and selling points would re-open today with Rbs125,000 to be offered for the shares - up from Rbs115,000 which was the last price quoted by MMM last week. However, the possibility that the crowd might turn violent or that the government might be blamed for the collapse was clearly present in ministers' minds - the more so since a representative of the Consumers' Federation, invited to the cabinet meeting, advised ministers to prop up MMM since its collapse would mean that 'total responsibility for it would fall on the government'. Mr Sergei Mivrodi, the elusive MMM chairman, has threatened to use his claimed 10m shareholders to force a referendum on the future of the government (for which only 1m signatures are required).  MMM Consultancy Group Ltd of Basingstoke, a resource management and logistics consultancy, would like it to be known that they have no connection whatsoever with the MMM company in Moscow.</p>

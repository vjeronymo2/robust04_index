			<p><P> June 19, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOOK REVIEW;  </P> <P> NO DANCING IN EMPTY EAST COAST 'BALLROOMS'  </P> <P> Make Believe Ballrooms. By Peter J. Smith (Atlantic Monthly Press: $18.95; 292  pp.).  </P> <P> What a surpassingly strange genre this is, these unpleasant little narratives  of wasted East Coast youth, that Bret Easton Ellis -- in a quote that goes far  beyond a blurb and into the realms of pontification -- labels "comedy of  irritation."  </P> <P> Ellis is right about one thing: "Make Believe Ballrooms" is supremely  irritating. I can't state that strongly enough. "Make Believe Ballrooms" is so  irritating that you don't get a chance to notice the plot is nonexistent (but  the author is very talented), until after you've calmed down.  </P> <P> This novel is a hymn of hatred to the whole human race, and Peter J. Smith  succeeds -- like a bratty little kid, bonking, bonking on one note of the  piano, until the rest of the assembled company rise up as one and shout,  "ENOUGH! Get some of your toys and go play outside for awhile. We can't take it  anymore!"  </P> <P> </P> <P> Egregious Errors  </P> <P> The point is: The author has set out to write a fatuous, plotless, stupid  little novel; he succeeded admirably. Bret Ellis likes it. His publishers must  have liked it. His editor liked it so much that he let his author get away with  egregious technical errors like letting the groom walk down the aisle at a  wedding, or racist inaccuracies like calling three Iranians "Moishe" (thus  managing to be both anti-Iranian and anti-Semitic at the same time), calling a  10-year-old sheep a "lamb," and I don't know what all.  </P> <P> And, yes, the subheading under the above-mentioned "point" is, of course, this  is a parochial review, from the West Coast, and all that. On the other hand,  "Make Believe Ballrooms" is nothing if not a parochial novel, taking the  position that New York City, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Miss  Porter's School make up the world. OK. No problem. Maybe they make up the  world, and maybe the author, publisher and editor are correct in that  assumption. My parochial answer to that would be: That still doesn't make a  10-year-old sheep a lamb.  </P> <P> The plot: Hal has a brother, Beck, who is marrying the most-awful nouveau riche  woman in the world, "Little Lisa Lyman." Hal has a sister, Fishie, who is such  a competitive swimmer that she shaves her head. Hal, Beck and Fishie drive  around in a family car named "Son." "Little Lisa Lyman" has a 7-year-old  brother named "Sir," and a grandma named "Sug," for "Shut Up, Grandma." Hal's  own nickname is "Children." My, those East Coast folks surely live in the fast  lane! And when Hal is rescued from his own anomie and ennui, it's by a girl  from Texas, named "Mary Ann Beavers." (I think that name gets accompanied by a  readerly sigh and the expostulation, "Ah, Ah! Eternal Youth!") Hal meets Mary  Ann and is saved from his awful life. Beck is eventually saved from the dreaded  "Little Lisa Lyman. . . ."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'English Major' Rules  </P> <P> In between the beginning and the end, the indeterminate middle-material of the  "English major" rules. We get an allusion to Erasmus on page 3, to Percy Bysshe  Shelley on page 30, three pages of jejune dopiness on Emily Dickinson starting  on page 16, a kind of interesting salute to Nathanael West's "The Day of the  Locust," through S.J. Perleman, on page 23, line 16. Also many little jokes  about machismo-mechanics for those who yawned through English: "Radiator," Hal  yells, when Son, his car, breaks down. "The diverter value linings redumbrated  at once! Use the B-900 Vatka Cloaca screws. And a fulcrum hammerhead so you  won't disengage the bindings!" This is Perleman all right, but Perleman at his  worst. And it's not just a function of being a young, East Coast, white male  with no "adventures" to write from. (Joseph Olshan, for instance, fits that  profile, and writes like an angel.) Peter J. Smith, for reasons of his own, has  written to irritate, and succeeded. Good luck to him.  </P></p>

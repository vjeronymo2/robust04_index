The  jump in gas production will be even greater: from 20.2 million  cubic meters per day to 24.6 million cubic meters per day--a  rise of 22 percent.    It happens that 1993 was not one of the most promising years  for investment in Petrobras, which was working with a limited  budget. Investments by the end of the year totaled about $2  billion, of which something like $980 million was spent to  develop the production of petroleum and natural gas.    But results were better than the company expected, according  to the assistant superintendent of the Production Department,  Bergson Antonio Cajueiro. The company extracted 669,000 barrels  per day, or 6,000 barrels per day more than had been expected  initially.    By the end of the year, the country had produced about 2  million barrels more than expected, with the result that it did  not have to import the equivalent of $32 million worth. Compared  to 1992, petroleum production was up 2.4 percent, and gas  production was up 6 percent.    That performance was due in particular to the fact that the  Bijupira-Salema (Campos Basin) and Caravela (Santos Basin)  fields produced more than expected in Petrobras' initial  calculations. There was also increased operational productivity,  according to Cajueiro.    The stars in petroleum production in 1993 were the Campos  Basin off the Rio de Janeiro coast and the Santos Basin, which  extends from Cabo Frio in Rio de Janeiro to Santa Catarina. They  played an important part in the increase in production and in  reserves, which, according to preliminary Petrobras  calculations, ended the year at 4 billion barrels, or 8.1  percent more than the total of 3.7 billion barrels in 1992.    All indications are that the Campos and Santos Basins will  continue to perform outstandingly in 1994, when Petrobras plans  to invest $1.1 billion to develop our country's petroleum and  natural gas production. The amount scheduled for all Petrobras  deals is $3.4 billion, according to Orlando Galvao, the  company's financial director. Two-thirds of that will be spent  on petroleum exploration and production.  <H5>  Challenge </H5>   Increasing petroleum production from 669,000 barrels per day  to 719,000 is being considered a challenge at Petrobras. After  all, as Cajueiro explained, that will come to 50,000 more  barrels per day, a quite significant amount. Moreover, there  will be the natural decline in production by producing wells. If  nothing is spent to expand production, production will fall from  669,000 barrels per day to 629,000 barrels per day--a drop of  40,000 barrels per day. So in fact, according to Cajueiro's  calculations, Petrobras will have to produce an additional  90,000 barrels per day to achieve 719,000 barrels per day  (40,000 to make up for the natural decline in production plus  the additional 50,000). By the end of the year, assuming an  average price of $16 per barrel (based on 1993 prices through  November), the state firm will have saved $520 million that it  otherwise would have had to spend on petroleum imports. The  major contributors to increased production will be the giant  Marlim and Albacora fields (in the Campos Basin), Caravela  (Santos Basin), and Urucu (Amazon Basin).    If petroleum production of 719,000 barrels per day (on  average) is confirmed by the end of 1994 and if consumption is  on the order of 1.3 billion barrels per day (a conservative  estimate), our country's oil fields will be supplying 55 percent  of our domestic requirements, while the remaining 45 percent  will have to be imported.</p>

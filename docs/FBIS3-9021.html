The Czech minister, Josef Zieleniec, said that the framework  of the plan, which the Czech Republic signed only recently,  should not change. In the opposite case new talks would be  necessary. He added that the Czech Republic was satisfied with  the current plan and did not consider any change feasible.    The Ukrainian minister, Anatoliy Zlenko, said he could only  agree with Kozyrev that the plan was not a panacea. But he  added that he believed that it was in the interest of all to  have the same status.    Zlenko expressed Ukraine's wish to cooperate with the  Visegrad Four (the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and  Slovakia). He said that such an important factor of European  developments as Ukraine could well complement the group's  activity.    Zlenko is ending a two-day visit to the Czech Republic  today.</p>

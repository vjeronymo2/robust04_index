			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Management: Going is good for Ladbroke 'riders' The Ladbroke Retail Management Challenge could well be another name for the 3.30 at Haydock Park. It is, however, a competitive distance learning course for 650 'riders' - betting shop managers, area managers and regional controllers from Ladbroke Racing - which ended this week with the announcement of the winner in London. Pinnacle, as the initiative was dubbed, is intended to address the general problem of motivating a far-flung management team. The game started six months ago with two preliminary rounds in which participants had to draw up a detailed business plan for their betting shop or area for the next financial year, as well as ideas for better marketing and expansion. The 'field' was whittled down to 60 for the semi-final (each had to make a presentation to the Ladbroke sales director), and to eight for the final (same again in front of a panel of judges). Richard Carter, sales director of Ladbroke Racing, believes one reason for Pinnacle's success is the way it combines fun with a serious purpose. The early rounds - completed with the help of guidance notes from the centre  -encouraged a better understanding of the profit and loss account and threw up detailed local strategies for targeting customers and improving the business mix in betting shops. 'There is a strong top-down as well as a bottom-up approach,' says David Richards of co-sponsors Ernst &amp; Young. 'A lot of games like this are abstract, but this one is relevant because participants have to deliver.' Carter is toying with the idea of a further challenge which rates participants on actual results. In the meantime, the eight finalists can look forward to having their bonuses doubled and the winner to visiting betting operations in California, Hong Kong and Berlin as part of a round-the-world trip for two.</p>

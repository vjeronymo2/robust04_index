Kitabatake of Central Research Labs, </F> Matsushita Electric Ind., Moriguchi, Osaka 570, Japan]    [Text] Direct transformation of graphite to diamond and SiC  heteroepitaxial growth on Si(001) were studied by molecular  dynamics simulations using the Tersoff potentials of carbon and  silicon. The carbon lattice of graphite was compressed along  c-axis and graphite diamond transformations were observed  after lattice relaxations. Hexagonal diamond and cubic diamond  were synthesized from graphite without any large atomic  displacements. Heteroepitaxial growth of single crystal 3c-SiC  on Si(001) was observed after carbonization of the Si(001)  surface. Breaking of the Si-Si bonds and shrinkage of the [110]  Si rows with C atoms are possible mechanisms for the  heteroepitaxial growth of SiC on Si(001).  <H5>  1. Introduction </H5>   We have used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to  understand microchemistry and microstructure of the material  syntheses and thin film growth.[.sup]1-4[/] MD simulations  enable us to follow atomic trajectories and configurational  changes in the processes. In this paper, mechanisms of direct  transformation of graphite to diamond and SiC heteroepitaxial  growth on Si(001) were studied at atomic scale using MD  simulations.    The simulations were carried out using the Tersoff many-body  empirical potential for Si and C.[.sup]5[/] The positions and  velocities of every atom in the computational cell were  calculated following each time step by integrating the equations  of motion using the Schofield algorithm.[.sup]6[/] The  potential energies and forces associated with each atom in the  computational cell, as well as the total potential energy and  maximum force value, were calculated for each time step and  atomic configurations were allowed to relax. The calculations  were carried out using MD and quasidynamic (QD)  techniques.[.sup]2[/] The position and velocity of each atom  were computed in a fully dynamic mode until both the total  potential energy and the total force of the ensemble  (independently) reached minima at which point the velocity of  each atom was set to zero. The system allowed to evolve further.  The procedure was repeated until stable atom positions with  approximately zero net force were obtained. After the QD  relaxations, initial unstable configurations changed to more  stable configurations which corresponded to a local potential  energy minimum.  <H5>  2. Graphite Diamond Transformations </H5>   Direct transformation of graphite (G) to diamond (D) has  been  reported using explosive shock compression[.sup]7,8[/] and  static high pressure methods.[.sup]9[/] Cubic diamond (cD)  and/or hexagonal diamond (hD) was synthesized by these methods.  Several models of mechanisms of these direct transformations of  G D was proposed.[.sup]8[/] Nevertheless a model of G  cD included unreasonable 60 degrees rotation or long slip of the  (0001)[.sub]G[/] planes. Another model of direct  transformation of G cD was initiated by rhombohedral  graphite (rG) which contained few percent in natural graphite.  Figure 1 [not reproduced] shows these conventional models of G  cD.    Direct transformations of G hD and G cD are discussed  using the MD and QD simulations. The carbon lattice of graphite  was compressed along [0001][.sub]G[/] axis. Small slip of the  (0001)[.sub]G[/] plane and small displacement of each atom in  the (0001)[.sub]G[/] plane were introduced to the initial  configurations of the QD relaxations. Direct transformation of G  hD and G cD were observed. Mechanisms of these G D  transformations were illustrated in Figure 2 [not reproduced].  <H5>  2.1. MD Simulations of G hD </H5>   G hD was observed when the QD relaxation was simulated  using the initial configurations as follows. The  (0001)[.sub]G[/] plane spacing of 3.35 Angstroms was  compressed to the (1 010)[.sub]hD[/] plane spacing of 2.18  Angstroms. Small displacements of 0.05 Angstrom perpendicular to  the (0001)[.sub]G[/] planes were introduced to the atoms in  the directions of the small arrows in Figure 2. Lower  (0001)[.sub]G[/] plane was slipped 0.5 Angstrom in the [10 1  0][.sub]G[/] direction as illustrated by large arrow in  Figure 2.    After the relaxation, lower (0001)[.sub]G[/] plane slipped  along the arrow and atoms 9, 12, 13, 16 displaced in the  [0001][.sub]G[/] direction. Upper plane atoms 10 and 11 made  bonds with lower plane atoms 13 and 16, respectively.  Relationships of the crystal axes between G and hD and the  stable atomic spacings (Angstroms) in each configuration were    [0001][.sub]G[/] [1 010][.sub]hD[/]: 3.35/2.18 (1),    [1 2 1 0][.sub]G[/] [1 2 1 0][.sub]hD[/]:  2.53/2.52 (2),    [10 1 0][.sub]G[/] [0001][.sub]hD[/]:  2.19/2.06 (3).    This mechanism of G hD transformation agrees with the  reported conventional models.[.sup]8[/]  <H5>  2.2. MD Simulations of G cD </H5>   On the other hand, G cD was observed when the QD  relaxation was simulated using the initial configurations as  follows. The (0001)[.sub]G[/] plane spacing of 3.35 Angstroms  was compressed to 2.18 Angstroms. Small displacements of 0.1  Angstrom perpendicular to the (0001)[.sub]G[/] planes were  introduced to the atoms in the directions of the small arrows in  Figure 2. No slip of the (0001)[.sub]G[/] plane was  introduced.    After the relaxation, lower (0001)[.sub]G[/] plane slipped  along the arrow (opposite direction to that of the G hD) and  atoms 1, 4, 5, 8 displaced in the [0001][.sub]G[/] direction.  The bonds 2, 3 and 6, 7 were broken. The shaded parts of the  (0001)[.sub]G[/] plane changed to the plane perpendicular to  the initial (0001)[.sub]G[/] plane. Lower plane atom 8 made  bonds with upper plane atoms 2 and 3. Relationships of the  crystal axes between G and cD and the stable atomic spacings in  each configuration were    [0001][.sub]G[/] [001][.sub]cD[/]: 3.35/1.78 (4),    [1 2 1 0][.sub]G[/] [1 10][.sub]cD[/]:  2.53/2.52 (5),    [10 1 0][.sub]G[/] [110][.sub]cD[/]: 2.19/2.52 (6).    This mechanism of G cD transformation is different from  the conventional models.  <H5>  2.3. Discussions </H5>   Experimental studies suggested that the axes relationship [1  2 1 0][.sub]hD[/] [1 10][.sub]cD[/] of the synthesized  diamond and syntheses of the fiber structure along the [1 2 1  0][.sub]hD[/] direction by the shock compression.    In our models, cD and hD synthesized by the direct  transformation of G exhibited relationships of (2) and (5). This  result suggests the relationship of [1 2 1 0][.sub]hD[/] [1  10][.sub]cD[/] which agrees with the experimental results.  The difference of the lattice spacing between G and D in the G  D transformations were small (&lt;1 percent) along the [1 2 1  0][.sub]G[/] direction and large (&gt; 13 percent for cD, &gt; 5  percent for hD) along the [10 1 0][.sub]G[/] direction. These  differences of the lattice spacings may cause the syntheses of  the fiber structure along [1 2 1 0][.sub]hD[/].    New G cD mechanism without unreasonable rotations or  displacements is proposed by the MD simulations.  <H5>  3. SiC Growth on Si(001) </H5>   Heteroepitaxial growth of cubic silicon carbide (3c-SiC;  _b_-SiC) on Si wafers has been investigated and the surface  reaction (carbonization) of a single crystal Si wafer with  gaseous hydrocarbons at elevated temperature is essential to  grow epitaxial single crystal 3c-SiC thin films.[.sup]10[/]  In this paper, the mechanism of the carbonization of the Si(001)  surface is studied at atomic scale using the MD and QD  simulations.  <H5>  3.1. MD Simulations </H5>   Thirty-six carbon adatoms were deposited on the surface of  the Si lattice whose dimension was 10 x 10 x 8 and the  configurational change after the QD relaxation was studied.    Figure 3 [not reproduced] shows atomic configurations of the  relaxed Si(001) surface with the C adatoms after 15,000 steps of  QD calculations. In the carbonized region, the [110] rows of the  (001) surface Si atoms shrink in the [110] direction with C  atoms. The side view of the third [110] Si-C row from the top in  Figure 3(a) is shown in Figure 3(b). It is clearly observed that  the Si surface layer atoms are pulled by the C atoms in the  [110] direction to form bonds of Si-C. Some of the Si surface  layer atoms (for example, atoms 1 and 2) are unconnected from  the second layer Si atoms (3, 4 and 5, 6, respectively). The  breaking of the Si-Si bonds between first and second layers  enables the shrinkage of the [110] row of Si surface atoms with  C atoms in the direction of [110]. Si atom 1 is displaced along  the arrow in Figure 3(a), (b) by C atom _a_ and makes new bonds  with Si atoms 5 and 6 while atom 1 initially has bonds with Si  atoms 3 and 4.    Two-layer two-dimensional configurations of Si and C (Figure  3(b)) correspond to the 3c-SiC configurations whose crystal  directions are 3c-SiC[001]//Si[001] and 3c-SiC[110]//Si[110].  This directional relationship between epitaxial 3c-SiC and the  Si substrate agree with reported experimental  results.[.sup]10[/] Five atom spacings of carbons in the SiC  configurations coincide with four atom spacings of the Si  lattice as illustrated by vertical lines in Figure 3(b). This  relationship agrees with the bond length ratio of the  crystalline lattice; Si/SiC = 2.35/1.89  5/4. Possible  heteroepitaxial growth mechanisms of 3c-SiC on the Si(001)  surface are elucidated by the MD simulation as the breaking of  the Si-Si bonds between first and second layer atoms in the Si  lattice and the shrinkage of the [110] row of the Si lattice  atoms with the C atoms.

			<p>BFN     [Text] The province's public security organs have cracked  a exceptionally serious fraudulent case of running joint  ventures by cheating and using the signboard of Sino-foreign  joint ventures to forge the certificates of foreign exchange  funds and to defraud customers of their money by more than 100  million yuan. Zheng Chen, and 14 other criminals have already  been arrested and brought to justice.    On 6 July last year, the Pingyi County Public Security  Bureau  seized five unlawful elements for illegally purchasing old bills  of U.S. dollars in the county's (Hongshi) Town. And 4.5 million  yuan in Renminbi, seven cars, and eight wireless mobile  telephone sets were captured on the spot. According to  preliminary investigations, they were an exceptionally serious  criminal gang engaged in fraudulence. This case has drawn the  attention of the provincial party committee, the provincial  government, and the Ministry of Public Security. The provincial  public security department has directly commanded the  investigation of this case and organized the public security  organs of related prefectures and cities to conduct  investigation in all directions. Through a lot of investigation  work, it has been ascertained that Zheng Chen, principal  offender, had been sentenced to three and half years of  imprisonment in Beijing on the charge of embezzlement and  bribe-taking. In April 1992, criminal Zheng, in collusion with  his partners, fled to Shandong and got acquainted with a foreign  trader through all sorts of relations. Under the condition of  paying $50,000 or 500,000 yuan in Renmenbi to this foreign  trader every year, Zheng used the name of this foreign trader to  run some false joint ventures in Weifang and Taian one after  another. Zheng Chen himself served as president and general  manager of these joint ventures. Then, by using the signboard  of Sino-foreign joint venture, and by using the mentality of  urgently needing foreign exchange among large and medium-sized  enterprises, Zheng Chen forged the certificates of foreign  exchange funds and signed many contracts on exchanging U.S.  dollars in the name of supplying goods. Whenever he gained a  certain amount of money by cheating, he wrote new certificates  of funds from banks to lure even more customers to be deceived.  In addition, by using the difference of time, he adopted the  method of drawing in a large amount of money and paying a small  amount of money and the method of tearing down the east wall to  repair the west wall to occupy a huge amount of funds for  operation and circulation. He also spent money without  restraint. It has been ascertained that this criminal gang  defrauded some 106 million yuan from more than 40 enterprises in  Hebei, Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, Shandong, and seven other  provinces and municipalities.    In the course of handling this case by public security  organs, in order to reduce the economic losses of the deceived  units and support enterprises to develop production, the  captured 60 million yuan of illicit money and property have  already been returned to the deceived units. At present, this  case is still under further investigation and handling.</p>

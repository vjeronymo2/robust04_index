			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "special correspondent" Ribamar Oliveira] </F>   [Text] New York -- Finance Minister Fernando Henrique  Cardoso on 18 March said that if he decides to run for the  presidency he will not be "the anti-Lula [Workers Party, PT,  candidate Luis Inacio Lula da Silva] candidate." Cardoso, who is  in New York negotiating a debt agreement with creditor banks,  said the IMF directorate is aware of the possibility that he may  leave the ministry to run for the elections and that such a  situation would not harm the negotiations. The following are the  main points of his news conference:    Candidacy -- "If I were a candidate, I would not be the  anti-Lula candidate. That is a mistake. But I have not decided  yet whether I will be a candidate. My dilemma is not that. I  must see whether the economic stabilization plan can be  maintained if I leave the ministry. It is not an elementary  issue. Frankly, I'd rather support some other candidate."    PT -- "The PT's problem is that it is a party that has very  defined ideas that go against the current issues. The PT has  never assumed a negotiating position and that makes things  difficult. The PT presupposes that it has an inherited or divine  right to govern the country. This is a mistake that makes them  assume a presumptuous and mistaken attitude. If it were not for  that reason we could negotiate even with the PT. But with that  attitude it is very difficult."    Alliances -- "We also made an effort with the PMDB  [Brazilian  Democratic Movement Party]. But nobody knows who will be the  PMDB candidate. Talks with the PFL [Liberal Front Party] were  suspended because it is too early to discuss alliances. It is  true that no one will be able to govern alone in this country.  The people currently want a common plan among the country's  political forces. We are offering the people a real plan, a real  path. Those who attack us are not presenting alternatives.  Everyone knows it is necessary to establish a path. The  stabilization of our currency is only a precondition to deal  with the major national problems."    IMF -- "I did not discuss the issue of my candidacy with the  IMF. It would have been inappropriate. Despite the rumors and  insinuations in Brazil, I have not made a decision yet about my  candidacy. But the IMF directors know I could become a  candidate. I do not believe my candidacy would affect relations  with the IMF."    Constitution Revision Process -- "Anyone who has a notion of  what is going on in Brazil knows it is necessary to amend the  Constitution. Not many articles must be modified and I think  there already exists a consensus about them. Maybe this  consensus is not sensed in Congress, but it does exist in  society."    Veto -- "This is not the moment for discussing wage  privileges for the public sector. The fact that the Chamber of  Deputies has not understood this is very serious."</p>

			<p><P> June 17, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'FIRST BORN' A GRIPPING GENETIC EXPERIMENT FROM A &amp; E  </P> <P> Cable's Arts &amp; Entertainment network continues to provide interesting  alternatives. The latest example is "First Born," a challenging and  intriguingly off-center, three-part drama from the BBC airing on consecutive  Saturdays and adapted from Maureen Duffy's futuristic novel, "Gor Saga."  </P> <P> Tonight's premiere (at 7, repeating at 11) almost immediately probes the  sometimes clashing agendas and interests of science and humankind, laying the  foundation for a tale about genetic experimentation that is captivating and  intensely disturbing.  </P> <P> British government scientist Edward Forester (Charles Dance) finally achieves  his dream, the creation of a "new species -- one with man's intelligence, but  without his homicidal aggression." A female gorilla secretly impregnated with  human sperm has given birth to a male hybrid that Forester names Gordon.  However, Forester's decision to spare the human-like infant -- whose only  outward simian manifestation is thick body hair that soon disappears -- will  return to haunt him.  </P> <P> In the coming years, Forester will be consumed by his terrible secret and his  attempts to hide the truth from his own wife (Julie Peasgood) and from Gordon  (Jamie Foster), who grows into a relatively normal teen-ager, unaware that his  mother was a gorilla. The tension builds when romance blooms between Gordon and  Forester's daughter.  </P> <P> Although marred by unexplained gaps and a terribly hokey sequence involving  kidnaping, blackmail and fiery death, Ted Whitehead's script is an otherwise  gripping, twisting, provocative and ironic exploration of moral and scientific  issues. The performances are excellent, Philip Saville directs suspensefully  and, all in all, "First Born" is absolutely first-rate. HOWARD ROSENBERG  </P></p>

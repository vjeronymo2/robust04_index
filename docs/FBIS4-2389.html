			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 10 (XINHUA) -- Faruq Qaddumi,  foreign minister of the State of Palestine, said that the  Palestinian issue should be solved according to relevant U.N.  resolutions, and that the Palestine Liberation Organization  (PLO) will continue to make efforts for a political settlement  of the issue.    Qaddumi, also director of the PLO Political Department, made  the remarks in an interview with XINHUA yesterday.    Qaddumi arrived in Beijing on Thursday [7 April] for a  six-day visit to China as guest of Chinese Vice Premier and  Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and left here today for Tianjin, a  north China port city.    Qaddumi told XINHUA that his current visit here is to  further  strengthen the friendly cooperative relations with China and the  traditional friendship between the Palestinian and Chinese  peoples.    He said that during his stay in Beijing, he held talks with  his Chinese counterpart Qian Qichen and met Chinese Vice  President Rong Yiren, and exchanged views with them on the  Middle East issue while briefing them on the negotiations  between Palestine and Israel as well as between other Arab  countries and Israel, and the situation in the occupied  territory.    Qaddumi stressed that Israel should withdraw from the  occupied territory so as to ensure a smooth implementation of  the agreement on Palestinian self-rule on the West Bank and in  Gaza.    He said that the PLO will make efforts and continue peaceful  negotiations for an early realization of the legitimate rights  of the Palestinians.    The foreign minister, who has visited China eight times,  expressed his thanks for the consistent support from the Chinese  Government and the Chinese people for the just cause of the  Palestinian people.    He regarded the Palestine-China agreement on economic and  technical cooperation signed by him and Vice Premier Qian as an  important result of his current visit, according to which China  will provide an interest-free loan of 75 million yuan renminbi.</p>

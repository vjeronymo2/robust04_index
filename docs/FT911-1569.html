			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Letter: TV and parallels with poll tax Sir, The current debate in your columns about the BBC television licence has some interesting parallels with the nearly departed poll tax. Poll tax was thought by many people to be unfair, not least because it was levied on every citizen. The proposed council tax, on the other hand, will be levied on householders - heads of family who have taken on financial responsibility of running their household. The TV licence has always been a household, not a personal tax. The probability that a whole family rather than just an individual would never watch the BBC seems quite remote. May I suggest that, when an increase in licence fee is next needed, it would be more equitable if single occupancy households enjoy the same 25 per cent discount that will be applied to the council tax.

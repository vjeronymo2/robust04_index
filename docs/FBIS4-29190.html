			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, June 16 KYODO -- Okinawa Prefecture  urged the United States to curtail its bases in southernmost  Japan in a full-page WASHINGTON POST advertisement Thursday [16  June], saying aircraft noise and shooting drills are hurting the  residents' living conditions and the environment.    The ad is timed with Okinawa Governor Masahide Ota's visit  to  the U.S., starting Thursday, to press the White House and the  Pentagon on the issue. Ota said in the ad that his past two  visits to the U.S. to seek a solution to the problems failed to  produce any concrete results.    Ota is scheduled to meet commanding officers of the  Hawaii-based U.S. Pacific Fleet. In Washington he will hold  talks with State Department and Pentagon officials as well as  with members of the Senate and House of Representatives Armed  Services Committees.    Some 75 percent of U.S. military facilities in Japan are  concentrated in Okinawa, comprising a cluster of islands  northeast of Taiwan. The ad calls for the return of the U.S.  naval port in Naha, and the abolition of parachute training and  live-ammunition exercises.    Okinawa was reunited with Japan on May 15, 1972 after a  27-year occupation, under the condition that U.S. Forces would  be allowed to continue to use the bases there.</p>

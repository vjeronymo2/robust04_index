			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Prudential If a life insurance company should be judged by its ability to sell life insurance, Prudential still has something to prove. Yesterday's 45 per cent rise in full-year profits owed more to recovery in general reinsurance - which the Pru admits is peripheral to its ambitions - than underlying momentum in long-term savings. Life insurance profits rose by 10 per cent. But that includes taking Pounds 50m of US investment gains into profits rather than diverting such windfalls into reserves, as was the case last year. On the accruals accounting method favoured by the Pru, the profit contribution from new life insurance business actually fell. Prudential might reasonably plead special circumstances. Restructuring its direct sales force in the UK has yielded annual cost savings of more thanPounds 100m, but with inevitable disruption. As reorganisation comes to an end, the sales force must start to perform. More worryingly, Jackson National proved extremely vulnerable to low US interest rates, which made its annuities less attractive than equity-based savings products. Perhaps an infusion of new management and revamped product range will be enough to reverse last year's 38 per cent drop in sales. It is certainly too early to pass judgment on either count. In theory, Prudential should be well placed to deal with tougher regulation at home. By deciding not to provide against mis-selling of personal pensions, it has shown touching faith in its record of compliance to date. While a yield 30 per cent higher than the market average might look generous in the light of yesterday's headline figures, the uncertainties demand no less.</p>

			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Hickson tumbles Speciality chemicals group Hickson International fell sharply after the news of an explosion at one of its plants, was joined by an analyst's sell recommendation and confirmation that a leading institutional shareholder had reduced its equity stake. The shares were weakened initially by news of the explosion which had destroyed one of Hickson's fine chemicals manufacturing plants at Ringaskiddy, in the Irish Republic. The explosion follows a fire last September at the company's plant in Castleford Yorkshire which killed five staff. The fire led to a Pounds 250,000 fine and Pounds 150,000 costs a month ago. After yesterday's news, Mr Martin Evans, chemicals analyst with Hoare Govett, turned seller of the stock. He said the explosion would hit investor confidence in the management and would lead to uncertainty over future production. He also said that a prospective p/e of 17 times was too high in the light of the troubles and a sector rating of 15 times earning and argued that the shares deserved to fall a further 10 per cent. Finally, Hickson confirmed yesterday that Gartmore, one of its leading shareholders, had sold 4.9m shares earlier in the week and taken its stake down to 2.2 per cent. Hickson's share price tumbled 14 to 194p with 1.1m shares changing hands. The announcement by Thorn EMI that negotiations to sell its defence electronics buisness to GEC had been called off hit both companies' shares. Leisure analysts said that the fall in Thorn's price - down 10 at 935p - reflected not only the market's immediate disappointment but also the fact that no other suitor could be called to mind immediately. GEC shares slipped a penny to 343 1/2 p. The two companies admitted last month that they were in discussions, with a price tag of Pounds 160m mentioned by industry specialists. Standard Chartered gained 25 to 885p ahead of interim figures on Thursday as buying pressure was accentuated by a bear squeeze. Reed International slid a further 8 to 652p, apparently affected by the caution of Dutch investors in Reed Elsevier over current trading conditions and future prospects for the combined group. Ms Chris Munro, media analyst at Hoare Govett, believes that the encouraging interim figures, together with the group's exposure to advertising and prospects of success in the Official Airline Guides deal will reassure both Dutch and British investors. Reuters Holdings again rose on enthusiastic US buying and strong UK recommendations in a thin market. The shares closed 20 firmer at 1535p. SG Warburg reiterated its buy recommendation for Carlton Communications on an earnings growth forecast of 25 per cent. The shares appreciated 11 to 764p. In the media agencies sector, Saatchi &amp; Saatchi went up 4 to 174 on a market forecast that Tuesday will bring news of interim profits of around Pounds 9m. A downgrade in United Biscuits undermined the shares which slid 8 to 381p. Hoare Govett chopped its profit forecast by Pounds 7m to Pounds 198m, blaming low food price inflation. Board changes and fresh investment at Amber Day lifted the shares 7 to 71p. An unfulfilled order was said to be holding Dixons up, the shares finishing 9 ahead at 236p. Sears, said to be benefiting from a Smith New Court upgrade, was up 5 at 109p. Glaxo failed to benefit from yesterday's rally after Nomura reiterated its 'sell' recommendation because of the potential downside of the forthcoming Zantac patent case. The shares closed unchanged at 529p.</p>

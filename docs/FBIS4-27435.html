			<p>BFN     [Text] Masayoshi Takemura, head of Sakigake [Harbinger],  held a news conference in Matsue City on 29 May, in which he  commented on the possibility of the cabinet resigning en masse  to pave the way for the Social Democratic Party of Japan's  [SDPJ] return to the coalition government. He said that his  response to SDPJ Secretary General Wataru Kubo's remark seeking  the voluntary resignation of the cabinet was, "The SDPJ's return  to the coalition by resigning en masse is improbable." This is  an attempt to restrain ongoing moves in the SDPJ.</p>

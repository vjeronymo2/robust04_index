			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["df"-signed report: "In the Future, Bonn Wants More Money </F> Back From Europe"]    [Text] Duesseldorf, 3 May -- In 1994, the Federal Republic  of Germany will pay an estimated 44.2 billion German marks [DM]  to the EU budget; of this sum, DM8.7 billion will go to the EU's  traditional own resources (customs and levies), DM23.3 billion  to value-added tax funds, and DM12.2 billion to GNP funds.  German payments to the "European Development Fund" (Lome  Agreement), which is financed outside the EU budget through  payments from member states, will presumably amount to DM913  billion [as published] in 1994.    This is what the Federal Finance Ministry says in its answer  to a written question in the Bundestag (printed matter 12/7296).  The ministry gives a detailed explanation of the legal and  technical bases for the financing of the EU budget by the member  states.    The German payment obligation results from the EC Council  decision of 24 June 1988 on the system of the Community's own  resources, which was ratified by the Bundestag on 20 December  1988.    This decision on the financing of the EU budget envisages  maximum EU resources totalling 1.20 percent of the annual GNP at  market prices in the Community.    This quota is achieved by means of the following revenue  procedures: In addition to its traditional own resources  (customs and levies), to which the Community is basically  entitled, the Community can access the revenue from the  value-added tax (value-added tax funds) up to 1.4 percent of the  "standard assessment basis."    This assessment basis corresponds to the sum of all sales at  final consumption level that are taxable under Community laws.  The methods of calculation are the same for all member states  and are stipulated in an EEC directive. According to the  Federal Finance Ministry, they are undisputed in substance.    The Commission and the Court of Auditors of the European  Community have to supervise the standardized calculation of the  value-added tax assessment basis by all member states. This has  probably not always been sufficiently done in the past.  However, the Federal Government now sees an "increasing  improvement."    The value-added tax assessment basis is only considered up  to  a maximum 55 percent of GNP, however. This lower rate was  introduced above all in response to criticism of economically  weaker member states which, compared with other member states  and measured by the respective GNP, have a relatively high  assessment basis.    The balance of the EU budget that is not covered by this  revenue is financed by way of a standardized rate of payment  being applied to the respective GNP of member states. The  harmonization of the assessment of GNP by EC directive was  started and is making "good progress," according to Bonn  officials.    The regulation on the EU's own resources, which was  basically  adopted by the European Council on 11-12 December 1992, is  intended to reduce the importance of value-added tax funds for  the period 1995-1999, and is to orient the structure of the EU's  own resources at the GNP system to a larger extent. This will  be done through the gradual reduction of the upper ceiling of  the value-added tax funds from 1.4 percent to 1.0 percent by  1999 and through the step-by-step reduction of the value-added  tax assessment basis to 50 percent of the respective GNP for all  member states.    According to the Federal Finance Ministry, from 1989 to 1997  the Federal Republic of Germany paid or will pay to the  Community budget the following sums (in billion German marks):    1989 -- 23.8    1990 -- 22.0    1991 -- 32.5    1992 -- 35.3    1993 -- 37.8    1994 -- 44.2    1995 -- 45.4    1996 -- 48.5    1997 -- 52.3    However, there have also been payments from the EU budget  back to the Federal Republic. This means that the net amounts  paid by Germany were lower (in billion German marks):    1989 -- 13.4    1990 -- 11.6    1991 -- 19.1    1992 -- 22.0    1993 -- 23.6    The Federal Government has said that because of the "erratic  course of paybacks," it is not possible at this early point to  estimate the German net payment for 1994.    On the basis of the resolutions adopted by the European  Council in Edinburgh in December 1992, the Council, the European  Parliament, and the Commission on 29 October 1993 agreed on a  spending plan for the period 1994-1999.    The Federal Government stresses in its statement that it  will  stand by the obligations it assumed within the scope of the EC.  The government, however, is prepared, in the scope of its  possibilities, to keep the Federal Republic's financial burdens  within acceptable limits by pursuing a strict course of  budgetary discipline.    The Federal Government will in the future increasingly "push  its financial interest in higher paybacks to Germany" in  connection with the formulation of unavoidable Community  expenditures and in connection with the appropriation of funds.  It is seeing possibilities of approach in particular in the  area of the so-called "internal policies."</p>

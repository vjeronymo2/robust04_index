			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading The derivatives sector had a volatile session which saw a recovery on the back of a firm Wall Street following initial weakness due to weakness in gilts, writes Joel Kibazo. In stock index futures, the March contract on the FT-SE 100 opened at a discount to an already weak cash market at 3,420. The poor form of the gilts sector prompted selling from the large institutions and the contract fell through its recent support level of 3,400. However traders reported buying at the lower levels, even as March declined indicating there was no clear view on the direction of trading from market participants during the morning. The strength of US bonds boosted the New York market and helped March bounce, which also offered dealers much sought after arbitrage opportunities. March finished at 3,430, at a 6 point premium to cash. Volume was 18,061 at the official close. Index options continued to lead the way in traded options business. The FT-SE 100 option finished with 20,842 lots while the Euro FT-SE 100 traded 3,541 contracts. BP was the busiest stock option at 3,561 lots, closely followed by NatWest Bank with 2,341 lots and Hanson with 1,940 lots. Activity in the OMLX futures remained poor with volume falling to 449 lots as the March contract on the Mid 250 index closed at 4,101.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Bernhard Jagoda, head of the Federal </F> Employment Office, by Adelbert Reif; place and date not given:  "`The Situation Is Explosive'"]    [Text] [Reif] Let us assume that the Federal Employment  Office were to cease to operate. What consequences would that  have?    [Jagoda] No one would be able to determine what the level of  unemployment, which is soaring, was. Millions of people would  not receive any unemployment benefit. Advice on careers,  qualifications, occupational rehabilitation -- all those things  would be gone. Apart from that, in 1993, which was a difficult  year for the economy, we found jobs for 700,000 people in the  new laender. In the old laender, we found employment for over 2  million people. Is that not something?    [Reif] Private employment agencies could also do that.    [Jagoda] Not, they would not be able to. I am not being  pigheaded when I say that a partial privatization of the labor  market will not yield any results. Incidentally, we can  scarcely talk of the Federal Employment Office having a  "monopoly" if the state service accounts for 30 percent of the  jobs that are found while newspaper advertisements and  information by word of mouth account for 70 percent. That is  perfectly all right. We are pleased whenever anyone finds a  job. My great skepticism with regard to private employment  agencies stems from the justified assumption that we will not  have more jobs as a result. If we end up with private  employment agencies and they function, then they will absorb a  lot of the people who are looking for jobs through us. We will  lose a clear picture of the overall situation on the labor  market. We offer people looking for work the opportunity to  inform themselves extensively about the jobs that are on offer  via computer. Once someone has that information, he can  initiate the application process himself.    [Reif] Have we not arrived at a point where there is too  much state control?    [Jagoda] Privatization must make sense and result in  success. The privatization of the labor market will not  contribute to a reduction in unemployment.    [Reif] Why not?    [Jagoda] Because it will result in agencies taking the pick  of the bunch and in a kind of revolving-door effect. Private  agencies will increase the amount of rotation on the labor  market. So, what we will find on the labor market is not that 7  million changes have been registered, but 7.2 million or 7.3  million changes. The unemployed, however, will remain on the  sidelines of this process. In other words, for those providing  such services, it will be more convenient to assist people in  changing jobs. On the other hand, those people who are in  difficulty because of their age or qualifications will find it  harder to obtain employment.    [Reif] Let us be honest for once. The Federal Employment  Office is nothing other than a costly, bloated, bureaucratic  institution that uses up enormous amounts of taxpayers' money.    [Jagoda] A certain degree of bureaucracy is necessary to  achieve things in a highly industrialized state. However, the  state administration constantly suffers from the shortcoming  that it is dependent on lawmakers. For example, when we read  what new decisions lawmakers have produced in the  BUNDEGESETZBLATT between Christmas and New Year, and then have  already changed a million of our decisions accordingly at the  beginning of January, I cannot say anything negative about the  Federal Employment Office in connection with bureaucracy.    [Reif] It is rather too easy to pass the buck to Bonn.    [Jagoda] Well look, almost daily, we receive new  instructions that have to be translated into practice. It is  not child's play. If I am not mistaken, the Law on Promoting  Employment has been amended 11 times by important pieces of  legislation and over 50 times as a result of other legislation  since 1969. At the same time, we seek to simplify things  wherever possible. There are many directives, instructions as  well as laws and decrees that we try to translate into practice  in a simplified form. In addition, we are continually making  organizational decisions with a view to slimming down and  decentralizing. Thus, as of 1 January 1994, we have made  budgetary provisions for job-creation measures, further  training, retraining, and rehabilitation at each individual  employment agency. So, the administration of every employment  agency not only knows what its budget for 1994 is, but, at the  same time, has received allotments for 1995 and 1996.    [Reif] Despite the dramatic increase in unemployment, you  now have less money at your disposal than before.    [Jagoda] It is true that we have much less cloth for cutting  our coat. However, I would not like to give rise to the  impression that we do not have any money with which to provide  help. Whoever is unemployed, even in November or December 1994,  can count on us. We are always able to meet our financial  obligations. Our budget now amounts to 107.2 billion German  marks [DM], of which over DM50 million is for the payment of  unemployment benefit.    [Reif] How do you assess your job in international terms?    [Jagoda] Compared to other industrialized countries, I  believe that we not only provide precise statistics, but also  set a certain standard through our active labor market policy  and our punctuality regarding payments.    [Reif] There are grave doubts precisely about how exact  your statistics are. In reality, there are said to be almost 9  million people unemployed, rather than 4 million....    [Jagoda] I am surprised that the figure is so modest.  Seriously, however, everything depends on how unemployment is  defined and one's basis for making calculations. If I say that  everyone between the ages of 15 and 65, or between the ages of  14 and 65, 68, or 70 wants to work, then the number of  unemployed will, of course, be much higher. Then, I can also  include all students and all those attending further training or  retraining courses by saying that they constitute "concealed  unemployment." That is something that I simply consider  impermissible. By pursuing further training or retraining,  these "unemployed" people are preparing themselves to enter the  normal work process tomorrow. You can be sure that the number  of people registered as unemployed that we give is correct. I  am firmly opposed to this juggling with horrific figures, which  is intended to cause panic among the public. The lesson of our  century teaches us that people have a pain threshold, and if one  sets a certain pain threshold that is not one in reality, then I  believe that to be irresponsible in terms of social policy.    [Reif] So, where is the pain threshold then?    [Jagoda] In the Weimar Republic, we crossed it in 1932 to  1933 at the very latest. The result was 1945. However, neither  today nor at the time of the Weimar Republic could anyone say  with certainty where the pain threshold lay and whether it has  been reached. We can only establish that with hindsight.  Whether we have 4, 5, 6, or ultimately 8 million unemployed is  of no consequence in this respect. The situation is explosive  every time. The point is that we have to be more resolute and  active in creating new jobs. Continually bemoaning the situation  leads nowhere.    [Reif] The number of people registered as unemployed has  just risen to over 4 million....    [Jagoda] Let me finish saying what I have to say. The pain  of unemployment is a pain felt at the individual level. It will  not be alleviated if more people become unemployed. For someone  who wants to work, for himself and his family, unemployment is  something exceptionally terrible. In that respect, the actual  level of unemployment is irrelevant. It is and remains a  personal tragedy. To reply to your question: This year, the  number of people registered as unemployed in the old laender  will rise by between 300,000 and 400,000. For 1993, the average  annual level of unemployment was 2.3 million for the western  part of the country, and with the increase that we are now  expecting, it will rise to between 2.6 and 2.7 million. Since  the middle of 1993, we have noted a trend toward stabilization  in the new laender, and there are some indications that  employment will increase. In January, however, the magical  figure of 4 million was exceeded. It will fall back in the  spring, but will remain high. At the end of the decade, over 3  million people will still be unemployed in the Federal Republic.    [Reif] Does this mean that Volkswagen's four-day week is  more than a desperate, but hopeless, struggle for work?    [Jagoda] Volkswagen's four-day week is not a model for the  German economy as a whole, but is a temporary solution. It is,  if you want to put it this way, an emergency solution for  Volkswagen.    [Reif] Company programs aimed at boosting efficiency  indicate that a further 500,000 jobs will be lost by the year  2000....    [Jagoda] I do not want to set figures. However, we will  lose jobs in manufacturing. On the other hand, employment will  grow in the construction and services sectors. Nevertheless, we  should not throw in the towel, but ask ourselves: How can we  create 500,000 new jobs by the year 2000? How are we going to  compete internationally? What new processes and products should  we develop? How can we promote and support patents? What  incentives do we need to acquire a greater role in global  economic and trade structures? It is simply nonsense to believe  that we can become internationally more competitive through  wages alone.    [Reif] Herbert Spaeth, president of the Handicrafts and  Trades Association, has reminded his colleagues to display more  responsibility with respect to jobs and training programs.    [Jagoda] My compliments to Mr. Spaeth. I have noticed that  the training program situation in larger companies has  deteriorated to reduce costs in the short term. I have observed  with concern that the number of places on training programs has  declined in the old laender above all.</p>

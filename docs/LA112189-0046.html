			<p><P> November 21, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROBE OF EX-HUD OFFICIAL SOUGHT  </P> <P> A congressional report released Monday recommends that the Justice Department  investigate a former federal housing official alleged to have violated ethics  laws by using government contacts to benefit her private business.  </P> <P> The report, endorsed by the House Government Operations Committee, concludes  that June Koch, a former Department of Housing and Urban Development official,  appears to have broken the law by using her HUD contacts to promote a  consulting firm she founded to advise U.S. companies doing business with the  Soviet Union.  </P> <P> Koch became HUD assistant secretary for policy development in 1984. Her duties  included arranging HUD participation in a number of trade issues involving the  Soviet Union.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, prosecutors expect a grand jury to return an indictment today  against a woman dubbed "Robin HUD" who admitted taking more than $5 million  from the government, sources said Monday.  </P> <P> HUD sources and the Justice Department said prosecutors had presented evidence  to the panel in Baltimore allegedly showing that Marilyn Louise Harrell, who  told Congress she took $5.5 million from HUD, had misused government funds on  several occasions. Harrell said she spent part of the $5.5 million to help the  needy.  </P></p>

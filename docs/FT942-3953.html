			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Delors jobs plan wins backing Plans to promote flexibility in European labour markets which fall well short of UK-style deregulation are spelt out in a European Commission progress report on last December's white paper on employment and competitiveness by Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, writes David Goodhart, Labour Editor. The report was warmly welcomed at a meeting of the Commission last week and will form the basis of Mr Delors' contribution to the European Council meeting in Corfu this month. The report, written by the employment task force at the Commission's directorate general for social affairs, says the white paper has been judged useful in all member states but 'a fragmentary approach is still noticeable' and the need for 'collective action' has not yet been realised. It also argues the white paper strategy is a medium-term one and that progress at this stage must be judged in terms of 'trends and changes in political positions'. The paper is vague on the appropriate role for Brussels in promoting the goals of the white paper. Reflecting the more cautious approach to European-level employment legislation spelt out recently by Mr Padraig Flynn, the social affairs commissioner, the report says Brussels should encourage countries to 'pick and mix' elements of policy from different national systems. The paper welcomes progress made on the white paper recommendation to reduce non-wage labour costs and approves of the steps being taken in countries such as Spain to liberalise redundancy and dismissal legislation.</p>

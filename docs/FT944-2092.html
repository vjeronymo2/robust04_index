			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (High-Risk Investment): Can warrants arrest their dive in '95? - Capital shares have done a little better. In both cases, Bethan Hutton finds optimism over the longer term Warrants and capital shares are rather like Longfellow's little girl: when they are good they are very, very good - but when they are bad, they are horrid. If you put a small amount of money into these investments, you stand a chance of multiplying your original stake several times over - and much more rapidly than if you put the same amount into ordinary shares. But you are also much more likely to lose everything. Warrants and capital shares are both highly-geared investments which tend to magnify the ups and downs of the market. WARRANTS give the holder the right to buy a particular share at a set price on a given date or dates. A warrant's worth depends on the time period before it expires and how close its exercise price is to the actual share price. When markets are going up and the share price shows signs of shooting well above the warrant's exercise price, the warrant price will take off. But if the share price is falling, the warrant normally will fall two or three times as fast. Warrants are issued most commonly by investment trusts, but some normal companies also have them. CAPITAL SHARES are found in split-capital investment trusts. This class of share usually has no fixed share of the profits when the trust winds up; instead, it gets whatever is left over when the other classes of share - zero dividend preference shares, income shares etc - have taken their due. If the markets have been favourable and the trust has grown strongly, then the capital shares will make fat profits. But if the market has slumped, their pickings will be lean. Stock markets have not had a good year in 1994 - at least, not since the beginning of February. So, investors in warrants and capital shares mostly have seen the value of their investments fall. You might expect them to have fallen much more dramatically than the underlying markets. But, as always, things are never quite that simple. Andrew McHattie, publisher of the newsletter Warrants Alert, says: 'With the market being off about 12 per cent, one would expect warrants to be down about 35 per cent. The average warrant is probably down about 25 per cent, but the average obviously disguises a lot of variable performances.' Likewise, capital shares have not done as badly as you might have expected. 'Capital share prices have, on average, proved to be remarkably resilient in 1994,' says Peter Walls, investment trust analyst at Credit Lyonnais Laing. The average capital share price is down 9.6 per cent since the start of the year, while the FT-SE-A All-Share index is down 11.65 per cent. Nigel Sidebottom, who manages portfolios of investment trusts at stockbroker Gerrard Vivian Gray, adds: 'The feeling might be that a geared investment like a capital share would have done worse than that. But the outcome is very mixed - there is tremendous variation. 'The best-performing stock in the investment trust sector was Mezzanine Capital, which rose by 24 per cent (between January 31 and December 8). At the other end of the scale, the worst-performing investment trust share was Scottish National capital, which fell by 50 per cent. Capital shares were at the top and bottom of the list.' Variation in warrant performance was just as extreme. The graphs show one of the best performing warrants (Yorkshire Tyne Tees Television, up more than 500 per cent between January 5 and December 13) and one of the worst (Thornton Asia Emerging Markets investment trust warrants, down almost 80 per cent over the same period). Careful selection is, therefore, crucial: the underlying investment, level of gearing, premium or discount level and general market conditions all need to be taken into account. Colin McLean, of Scottish Value Management, is in charge of the Warrants and Value investment trust. He tends to pick short-life warrants issued by companies. 'Warrants which are in companies rather than investment trusts have tended to be more volatile,' he explains, 'but they can offer better value.' The portfolio of warrants recommended by McHattie's newsletter this year is down an average 0.98 per cent over the year. But 14 of the 26 stocks made losses, several of more than 40 per cent. The portfolio is redeemed by one warrant, British Biotech. This was tipped in May at 43p and has climbed 188 per cent to 124p. This is not an area to be recommended for novices, widows, the elderly, or those of a nervous disposition. But, strangely enough, orphans - or people investing for children or grandchildren - are less likely to be warned off capital shares and warrants. The reason is that while the short-term ups and downs can be the investment equivalent of a white-knuckle ride, they can offer higher growth than many other investments over the long term. Unfortunately, some people ventured into the market this year who probably should have stayed away. McHattie says: 'It has been a typical private investor sob story in many respects, because the market had just enjoyed a fantastic period - 1993 was a year of exceptional gains, where the average warrant tripled in value.' Naturally, this was noticed. 'We had a surge of private investors coming into the market at the start of the year. They did very well in the first three months, but then it all went very sour.' McHattie does hold out some hope. 'My view is that warrant investors may expect a better performance in 1995. I am looking for average gains of 25 per cent from UK warrants in 1995, with many of the gains to come from Asian trust warrants which fared badly this year.' Sidebottom says some capital shares are attractive now, although not necessarily those which have fallen furthest. For private investors, he favours the less highly-geared trusts (such as M&amp;G Dual Capital) which have held up better in poor market conditions, rather than very highly-geared examples (like Scottish National) which have dropped right back and might be thought cheap.</p>

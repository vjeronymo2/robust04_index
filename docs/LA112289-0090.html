			<p><P> November 22, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> Basketball Coach Bill Frieder of Arizona State said that junior forward Sam  Mack will remain under indefinite suspension from the team until a  sexual-assault complaint filed against him can be reviewed by athletic  department officials.  </P> <P> The Maricopa County Attorney's office said that it would not prosecute Mack in  the case because of insufficient evidence.  </P> <P> Mack, 19, was accused in the alleged rape of an 18-year-old female in a campus  dormitory room rented by two Sun Devil players Nov. 5. Frieder suspended Mack  three days later, but Mack was allowed to stay in school and keep his  scholarship.  </P></p>

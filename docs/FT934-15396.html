			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Bell Atlantic buys into Mexican cellular market BELL Atlantic has agreed to pay Dollars 1.04bn (Pounds 680m) for a 42 per cent stake in Iusacell, Mexico's second largest cellular telephone company, and holder of a potentially lucrative concession to own a national wireless telephone network. The purchase is the largest foreign stake taken in a Latin American cellular company and may herald further acquisitions by Bell Atlantic in the region. Bell Atlantic and Iusacell plan to invest in a national wireless telephone network. While such a service will initially be limited to local calls, Iusacell and Bell Atlantic are expected to seek a licence to offer a long-distance service in August 1996, when Telefonos de Mexico's long-distance monopoly comes up for review. Iusacell is controlled by Mexican industrialist Mr Carlos Peralta, who will continue to run the company, but with operational and technical help from Bell Atlantic. Under Mexican law, foreign concerns can own up to 49 per cent of a cellular telephone company. Bell Atlantic will immediately acquire 23 per cent of Iusacell, and another 19 per cent later. Iusacell will make a public offering of a further 10 per cent of its capital and seek a listing on various stock markets. The purchase will dilute Bell Atlantic's earnings by 18 to 20 cents a share next year, and the company does not expect to break even from the deal for five years. Iusacell owns a cellular concession in Mexico City, and controls other concessions in Guadalajara, the centre and south-east of Mexico. It has 135,00 subscribers, making it second to Telcel, the national cellular company owned by Telmex. Iusacell's concessions cover about 60m people, 72 per cent of the Mexican population. The transaction values Iusacell at Dollars 40 to Dollars 44 per person covered by its concessions, about one sixth of the multiple seen in the US. However, cellular penetration in Mexico is far lower. 'On a per-population basis Bell Atlantic is over-paying,' says Mr Bill Deatherage, a telecommunications analyst at SG Warburg Securities. 'But they are placing a significant value on the nationwide wireless licence.' The cellular market in Mexico has boomed since it was opened in 1989. While customers can wait months, even years, to acquire a telephone line from Telmex, it takes just an hour or so to buy a cellular phone.</p>

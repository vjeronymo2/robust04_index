			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> DEA first encountered 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine in Texas in 1979. Since that time, several other exhibits of 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine have been analyzed by DEA and state forensic laboratories in California, Arizona, Louisiana, Pennsylvania, Iowa, Oregon, Georgia, Tennessee and Florida. Clandestine laboratories producing 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine were seized in California in 1986 and in Arizona in 1992. It has been represented as 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA) and has been sold in sugar cubes as LSD. More recently, it has been promoted as an aphrodisiac and distributed under the product name of NEXUS whose purported active ingredient is brominated cathinine. DEA has recently seized several thousand dosage units of this product.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The continued clandestine production, illicit importation, distribution and abuse of 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine poses an imminent hazard to public safety.

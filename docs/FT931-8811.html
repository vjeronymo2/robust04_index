			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / Management: A time and motion study for the House - Can parliament be more efficient 'Reform in this House proceeds exceeding slow. It makes a snail look like Nigel Mansell.' Sir Peter Emery, Conservative MP and Commons procedure committee chairman. Management consultants have infiltrated the gates of Whitehall, as government reform of civil service working practices bears witness. But the barbarians have yet to penetrate the Palace of Westminster. MPs jealously continue to guard the right to decide how business in the engine room of Britain's democracy is conducted. The result is that little ever changes. But what might such a team of unelected executive mercenaries come up with if unleashed on the green leather benches of the House of Commons debating chamber? How would they suggest that business might be ordered more efficiently? Here is an idea of what Messrs Rag, Tag and Bobtail might propose. First the good news: the Commons scores full marks for effort. While ritualistic trappings give proceedings a leisurely and anachronistic air, the chamber sits for longer than any comparable legislature. MPs work on average a punishing 62-hour week - though increasingly outside the debating chamber. Even critics of current practice, such as John Garrett - Labour MP for Norwich South and, incidentally, a management consultant - admit parliament 'processes thousands of pages of legislation, produces hundreds of reports and airs countless grievances at remarkably little cost'.* But when it comes to organising this time there is room for improvement: Hours. The Commons needs a comprehensive time-management study. Delaying the start of sittings four days a week until 2.30pm was fine before 1911 when MPs were unpaid and of necessity part time. But it means the Commons frequently rises well after midnight. With most MPs on the go from 9am or earlier, such a schedule is an inducement to work absurdly long hours and scarcely conducive to effective debate. On Fridays, when MPs are keen to return early to their constituencies, business starts at 9.30am. So there seems little reason why the current timetable should not simply be brought forward five hours from Tuesday to Thursday. No fewer than 83 per cent of MPs responding to a questionnaire prepared by a cross-party committee examining possible reforms in 1991 favoured reducing the number of late sittings. When it reported last year, the committee's recommendations advocated merely one extra morning sitting per week, along with some Fridays off and greater efforts to wind up at 10pm. Committee stage of bills. The development process in the Commons for Westminster's core product line - legislation - could do with an overhaul. Currently, effective scrutiny of a bill is too often subordinate to party political skirmishing. This means the care with which a bill's contents are examined and amendments considered, frequently bears little relation to the measure's intrinsic qualities. One way of correcting this imbalance and ensuring all clauses of a bill receive equal scrutiny would be to provide for automatic time-tabling from the outset of the committee stage of detailed consideration. This innovation would also save time in the chamber by making debates on time-tabling motions to limit debate redundant. Summer recess. The Commons' holiday arrangements should correspond better with the need to subject the government to year-round scrutiny. As Labour's Harry Barnes and Jeff Rooker have argued, parliament's three-month summer recess deprives MPs of the ability to tackle ministers with written and verbal questions to which they must publicly respond. It also strips MPs of the protection against libel which the parliamentary privilege applied to everything uttered in the chamber provides. The system championed by Joan Walley, Labour MP for Stoke-on-Trent North, providing for a five-week cycle of four weeks at Westminster and one week away, would be a sensible improvement. Votes. There can be few spheres in which Bulgaria has anything to teach Britain on productivity. But voting in the national parliament is one of them. The wizardry of their electronic voting system means Bulgarian MPs can conduct a vote in a twinkling of an eye compared with their British counterparts, conserving valuable parliamentary time for other matters. For example, the two cliff-hanging votes in November which secured Maastricht's return to the Commons took a total of 31 minutes. Installing an electronic voting system would represent a big step forward in updating British parliamentary practice. But there is little chance of the government agreeing to it. As the Maastricht debacle demonstrated, there is nothing like having MPs queueing up to troop through the lobbies to make the government whips' task of dissuading backbench rebels that much easier. Prime Minister's Questions. Since MPs have only about 30 minutes per week in which to question publicly the prime minister, it is bizarre to waste vital seconds in pro forma inquiries about his engagements. This happens because verbal questions must be submitted some two weeks ahead of time. It is difficult then for the questioner to frame a topical question; so most fall back on the formula, revealing their real interest only in follow-up questions. The required innovation - abolishing the notice-period - is self-evident. *Westminster - Does Parliament Work? By John Garrett. Published by Victor Gollancz. Price: Pounds 17.99.</p>

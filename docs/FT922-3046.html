			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / 'You'll just have to trust me': The Big Lie - Inside Maxwell's empire - He committed one of the biggest frauds of recent years. In a seven-month investigation the FT has uncovered how Maxwell, vain, domineering and deluded, fooled the world THE SUNDAY morning calm of Oxfordshire on July 7 last year was broken by the clatter of helicopter blades. The four-seater Aerospatiale Twin Squirrel, registration G-RMGN, with the Mirror Group Newspapers lion growling on its side, lowered itself onto the grass in front of Headington Hill Hall, a 30-room Edwardian mansion. Robert Maxwell stepped out. The weather forecast had said it would be one of the hottest days of the year, and staff carried Maxwell's desk and telephone out from the house to the side of the pool. A chauffeur-driven car pulled up and Maxwell's youngest son Kevin jumped out, looking tense and irritated. 'Get me Richardson on the phone,' Maxwell told his secretary, demanding to speak to the chairman of Smith New Court, the ambitious City stockbrokers to Maxwell's public companies. Sir Michael Richardson, who was entertaining members of the local foxhunt and their families to Sunday lunch, was called to the phone. Maxwell told him he had changed his mind. He no longer wanted to step down as chairman of Maxwell Communication Corporation (MCC), his largest company. He would not give way to Peter Walker, the former Tory cabinet minister who was a director of Smith New Court. This was a devastating blow to Kevin. As MCC's chief executive, he had longed for the day when he would run the show. It had been his plan to bring in Peter Walker. But now there would be no liberating change in style, no freedom from the whims of a dominant father. A furious row erupted between father and son by the side of the pool. With the Filipino maid still laying the table for lunch, Kevin drove off, shaking with rage. When Maxwell's decision became public two weeks later, MCC's shares started to collapse, and accelerated the Maxwell empire's slide to disaster. But the alternative - allowing Walker into the inner sanctum  - would have been impossible. Giving control to an outsider might have led to the discovery of the awful truth at its heart. The Robert Maxwell story is about the vanity, brutality and delusion of one man, and how he persuaded others to believe him. He borrowed Pounds 3bn from the world's biggest and most respected banks to build an empire that was doomed to failure. As it tottered, he stole more than Pounds 900m from his companies and their pension funds, most of it in just 10 months as he made a futile effort to pacify the banks. All he bought with the stolen pensions of 30,000 past and present employees  -many of whom now face destitution - was a few more months of life at the cost of Pounds 3m a day. No-one stopped him committing one of the biggest business frauds of the century. One after the other, the lines of defence failed: directors, banks, trustees, pension regulators and the Bank of England. They failed to notice the signs, or to recognise their seriousness; in some cases, they even failed to look. But the signs were there. As Maxwell was arguing with his son in his Oxford garden, the cracks had started to appear. One crack opened the very next day. The small blond man who stepped into the revolving doors of Maxwell Communication Corporation at Holborn Circus in the centre of London on Monday July 8 was unprepared for the shock that hit him. He was about to stumble on one of the first signs of trouble in the Maxwell empire, but he could hardly have guessed at the crisis that lay hidden. Basil Brookes had been MCC's finance director for only nine months: one of Robert Maxwell's chosen few, with a ringside seat at the unfolding drama, or so he thought. MCC, whose most valuable asset was US publisher Macmillan, ranked as one of the top 100 companies on the London stock market. It was valued at Pounds 1bn, making it worth more than twice as much as Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN), Maxwell's second public company. It was Brookes' first public company directorship, and an impressive post for someone aged only 33. Looking through the accounts, Brookes expected to see that MCC had a comforting pile of Pounds 200m ready cash in the bank. But the money had vanished. 'We were hoarding that cash,' Brookes says. MCC was creaking under nearly Dollars 2bn of debt and needed the money to pay the bankers. In a normal company, the missing amounts could easily have been traced. But in Maxwell's corporate labyrinth, figures were hard to come by, even for finance directors. The company ledgers for June had not yet been drawn up, so Brookes had painfully to reconstruct MCC's payments from the treasury department, which, under Kevin Maxwell's day-to-day direction and Robert Maxwell's authority, moved cash around the Maxwell empire. Brookes says: 'It was always an effort to get information out of the treasury - they were always busy and chaotic. It took me a few days to get the numbers, but I got them.' To his horror, the cash had disappeared into the companies that Maxwell called the 'private side' of his empire. This 'private side' - a tangled web of nearly 400 companies, many no more than brass nameplates in offshore tax-havens - was run by Maxwell, his sons Kevin and Ian, and a few trusted aides from the London offices. It held Maxwell's investments in property and foreign newspapers, as well as blocks of MCC and MGN shares - Maxwell's majority shareholdings in the public companies. The web was gathered under two parent companies: Headington Investments, owned by a Gibraltar trust company, and the Maxwell Charitable Foundation, registered in the secretive principality of Liechtenstein. Tight confidentiality laws and obsessive secrecy within the core group shielded both companies from public scrutiny. Directors of the public Maxwell companies, MCC and MGN, talk of an 'iron curtain' which divided them from that hidden empire. In May, MCC had lent Pounds 75m of its precious cash to the private side. But Kevin Maxwell, a director of both the private and public companies, had assured Brookes that the money would be repaid by the end of June. As he combed the books, however, Brookes realised the hole had more than doubled, mainly during June, to Pounds 180m. 'My reaction was one of shock,' says Brookes. 'I felt let down. First, it wasn't back to zero. Then, no-one had bothered to tell me.' He ran up the stairs from his office on the eighth floor to Maxwell's on the ninth, and met Maxwell and Kevin together. They told him there had been a delay in selling some of the private side businesses, but promised the hole would soon be filled. Brookes found the story plausible. It was not the first time MCC had lent the private side money - there was a history of such loans - but MCC had always been repaid. Nevertheless he kept checking. Each morning he dug out the bank statements from the post and pieced them together. Any relief he might have felt soon evaporated. Within days, more money had gone out: Pounds 75m in one lump, on a single signature - Robert Maxwell's. To Brookes' acute frustration, this was within the company's rules. In most companies it would be impossible for the chairman to pay out so much money on his own. But MCC had its own rules, dating from when it was called British Printing Corporation and was rescued by Maxwell from financial disaster. In a fateful board resolution on November 26, 1981, Robert Maxwell had assumed supreme power. His signature alone could sign away the company's assets. Brookes had no way of stopping more money vanishing. 'I was fighting 10 years of history,' he says. Brookes ran up the stairs again, around the corner, and down the short grubby corridor that led to Kevin's office. 'I asked him 'What the hell is going on?' Kevin said, calmly: 'I'm under instructions not to talk to you. You must go to my father'.' Brookes opened the double doors to reception and dodged left down the corridor to Maxwell's secretary, who allowed him into Maxwell's office. Seated behind his desk at the far end of the 60ft room, Maxwell refused to tell Brookes where the Pounds 75m had gone and when it would come back. Brookes said: 'I have to know, it's my job.' But Maxwell rebuffed him, saying: 'You'll just have to trust me. It's all OK.' Brookes spent the next few nights sleepless. 'I got really worried as the days went on. It was so much money, it went so quickly and they wouldn't talk about it.' He telephoned Richard Baker, MCC's former deputy managing director, who had left in February. Baker had been one of Brookes' main allies in Maxwell House. Baker, a combative man, had done nothing to soften the outside face of MCC. But he had also turned his trenchancy against Maxwell. One of MCC's main bankers comments: 'I think it made an extraordinary difference that Baker left.' In a scene which characterised the sense of conspiracy that would grip the Maxwell empire, the two men arranged to meet outside a rugby club near High Wycombe. They parked next to each other, and Brookes went to sit in Baker's car. Baker told him: 'You've got to see Kevin, and if you don't get an explanation, then you have to take professional advice on your own behalf.' What Brookes did not know was that Maxwell was taking money from MCC partly because other sources were drying up. On July 10 at 3pm Maxwell had asked National Westminster, the second largest UK bank and one of the largest lenders to Maxwell, for another Pounds 40m loan for his private companies. The bank had refused. Nor did Brookes know, and would not know until weeks after Maxwell's death, how some of the money siphoned off from MCC had been spent. In mid April Maxwell had begun an illicit operation to prop up MCC's shares, which eventually cost some Pounds 250m. The share support coincided with the disappearance of money from MCC, and the company's administrators now believe some of MCC's money was used to buy the shares. However, it is against the Companies Act for a company to buy its own shares without shareholders' permission or for a director to buy shares without telling the company. In one of his most closely-guarded acts, Maxwell had routed cash through the private side and out to secret trusts in Liechtenstein and Switzerland, in order to disguise the identity of the buyer of the shares. He told brokers who dealt for him that these trusts were entirely independent, but it is now clear that the shares that were bought were under Maxwell's control. Maxwell had resorted to this desperate measure because the survival of the private side hung on MCC's share price. It was this fatal intertwining of the two sides of his empire that was to lead to its collapse. Unknown to the outside world, the private companies had accumulated debts of some Pounds 1bn in 1991. To raise this huge sum, Maxwell had pledged his own shares in both MCC and MGN to the banks, effectively mortgaging them. But MCC's share price had been falling since the autumn of 1990 because the market was worried about the company's massive debt. If the share support scheme could not halt the slide, the banks would call in their loans, and the private side would crash. Maxwell was like a home owner with a huge mortgage on a house whose value was dropping by the day. On Wednesday July 17 the bomb dropped: MCC's annual report was published. The outside world learnt that Peter Walker, who represented the hope that MCC would be run in a conventional way, would not become its chairman. Maxwell explained that MCC was now planning to demerge its US businesses, which made 90 per cent of its profits, one of Peter Walker's recommendations. 'The task he (Walker) was originally invited to do . . . the chairman of the entire group both in the US and Britain . . . will no longer exist,' said Maxwell. In his first, extended interview since his departure from MCC, Walker says he was told by Maxwell on July 11 that 'his services as chairman would no longer be needed'. He says that at the time he thought the decision sensible, as he thought the demerger was in the company's best interests. However, the demerger never happened; Samuel Montagu, one bank approached by Maxwell to draw up plans, says Maxwell never held a formal meeting with the bank on the subject. In retrospect, Walker says, 'Maxwell may have wanted me out of the way. It clearly would not have been possible to keep it all hidden. I was going to set up an audit committee for a close look at all the figures, starting on July 18, the very next day.' The stock market, horrified that Robert Maxwell would stay in charge, began to savage the shares. That week MCC shares fell from 202p to 185p, increasing the strain on the private side. On Friday July 26, Brookes discovered that another Pounds 50m had vanished from MCC, although some had trickled back. The company's administrators now believe that part of this could have been used to buy still more MCC shares. Brookes was now faced with a Pounds 275m hole. It was time for him to protect him-self - and to warn the other directors. Three days later, Brookes wrote out his resignation. It was untyped - he had not trusted it to the secretaries - but he filled two pages with large, neat, rounded handwriting. His lawyers had told him: 'You can resign, but don't walk out until this is settled - you have responsibilities as finance director. And you must get a full meeting of the board.' Robert Maxwell was abroad when Brookes put the letter on his desk. But Kevin, who seemed relaxed, took a copy and agreed to call a board meeting for 10am on Thursday August 1. Word spread among some of the directors that the reason for the meeting was that 'the Maxwells have taken all our money'. Furious, but worried they braced themselves for a confrontation. The anxious group included Brookes, tax director Ron Woods and deputy chairman Jean Pierre Anselmini. Five minutes before the board was due to meet, Robert Maxwell, who was still abroad, telephoned to postpone the meeting to the next day. Then, as the directors gathered on Friday morning, he called again and cancelled the meeting. The Maxwells were fond of challenging the loyalty of their directors. 'Are you with us or against us?', they would ask. From that Friday, the answer was: 'Against you.' On Sunday August 4, Brookes went into MCC to answer a nagging mystery: how had the private side borrowed more money from MCC than the company had to lend? By the evening, Brookes had dug up the answer. He telephoned Peter Laister, a non-executive director, and Woods, and told them to meet him at 11am the next morning. Brookes had uncovered another shock. The mystery money had been 'borrowed' from MCC's banks in an highly irregular way. The money was in effect borrowed for one reason but ultimately used for another. Starting around July 4, when the senior treasurer had gone on holiday, MCC's treasury, under the authority of Robert Maxwell and Kevin, had begun to buy enormous amounts of foreign currencies. The ground rules of these so-called 'spot deals' are that the currency must be paid for by the close of business each day. The world's largest banks, which trade billions of pounds worth of currencies each day, move fast to blacklist any company that does not pay on time. But MCC did not pay up. Several days later, when the banks bombarded the company's switchboard in fury, the treasury raised money to pay them by entering into more contracts with a second set of banks. Again, it did not pay, until it had struck deals with a third set of banks. In three weeks, MCC burned its bridges with some 20 of the world's biggest banks. It was a crippling situation for a company that straddled the Atlantic and which had made much of its profits from dealing in foreign exchange. Despite the seriousness with which they viewed the breach, none of the banks appears to have investigated further. None saw this behaviour as sufficiently worrying to warrant a word to the Bank of England. Surveying the figures, which showed Dollars 100m still unpaid, Brookes came to the sobering conclusion that the frantic deals had halted only because the company had run out of banks. That led him to the even more frightening conjecture that, if the private side was apparently so desperate for money, it could be in crisis - and that MCC could be sacrificed in the panic. The MCC directors who had made this discovery, including the non-executives Laister, Lord Rippon, the former Tory cabinet minster, and David Shaffer, a US director, had a clear choice at that point. They could go public with the discovery or they could stay silent. They chose the second course. Had they chosen the first, the Maxwell empire would have died three months earlier than it did, and over Pounds 200m of pension and company money could have been saved. But they were unaware of the crisis in the rest of the empire. The choice was difficult because of the conflict between two sets of responsibilities. Directors have obligations under the Financial Services Act to make public important news that could affect the share price. But under the Companies Act, they must also act in the company's best interest. The directors guessed, rightly, that if the private side was desperate, it would have pledged its MCC shares to its banks. So if they made the loans public, the shares would crash, bringing the private side down too, and MCC would never get its money back. The next day, early in the afternoon of Tuesday August 6, Laister went to consult solicitors Macfarlanes about the conflict. He reported to the group at 4pm: stay quiet - and get the money back. In retrospect, the directors were in a stronger position than they may have realised. Having chosen that route, they could have pursued it with more resolution. If they had threatened Maxwell repeatedly that they would resign en bloc and make their reason public, they might have succeeded in filling in more of the hole in their company. Instead, the directors appear to have allowed themselves to set aside their own diagnosis of the crisis in the private side of the empire. They relaxed too soon. They were also comforted by the sudden reappearance of some of the money. Over the weekend and during that Monday, the Pounds 275m hole had shrunk to Pounds 135m. 'We were deeply relieved,' says Laister. Suddenly, at 5pm, while the directors were digesting Macfarlanes' verdict, Robert Maxwell ordered them to assemble for a board meeting at 6pm in his office. He had chosen his moment well: the directors were calmer than they had been the week before. Maxwell was seated at his huge black circular table, with Kevin on one side and Ian on the other. The four dissident London directors - Laister, Brookes, Anselmini and Woods - ranged themselves on the opposite side. Maxwell accused them of meeting in secret cabals without the Maxwell family, and ordered them not to take notes, saying that he would circulate minutes afterwards. Guessing - rightly - that those minutes would never appear, the directors met at 7pm to compile and initial their own version. Brookes says: 'We picked Ron's office as it was in the Mirror building - we were less likely to have one of the family barge through the door.' Their minutes note that Kevin had promised that the situation was in hand and he would provide a timetable for paying back the rest of the money. Laister says: 'Not for one second did Kevin or Bob give any indication they were worried. The opposite, in fact.' Brookes adds: 'We thought it had gone reasonably well. It had been pretty hostile, but it was a big step in the right direction.' To the relief of the directors, the temperature inside Maxwell House continued to cool. By August 15, the private Maxwell companies had repaid Pounds 164.7m to MCC. The directors took comfort from the scrawled note from Robert Maxwell, initialled by Kevin, on August 21. It said that 'the borrowings by Headington Investments from MCC have not been used in any way that would contravene the Companies Act' - a question Macfarlanes had insisted he answer. But it is now clear that by that point, the illegal share support scheme had consumed some Pounds 250m, almost certainly much of it MCC's money. They would not have slept if they had known where the Pounds 165m that they gratefully received had come from: Pounds 15m now appears to have come from the liquidation of a portfolio of Japanese shares that belonged not to Maxwell, but to Swiss Bank Corporation. Pounds 60m had come from an extension of the private side's overdrafts: more debt it could not repay. Pounds 40m had travelled, through the airlocks of several private-side bank accounts, up four flights of stairs and along 200ft of corridors from Mirror Group Newspapers next door. And the final Pounds 50m? It now appears to have come indirectly from the sale of shares belonging to the pension funds of Mirror Group Newspapers and MCC. MCC's success in getting its money back was at the expense of others. Fires were breaking out right through the Maxwell empire. Every source of money was drying up, and in the following three months Maxwell would raid again and again the money upon which his unsuspecting pensioners were relying for their future.

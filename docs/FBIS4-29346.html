			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 17 KYODO -- Japan and the United States  are unlikely to reach accord on all of the three priority fields  under the trade "framework" talks before the Naples summit of  the Group of Seven key industrial countries in July, Trade  Minister Eijiro Hata said Friday [17 June].    Settlement on auto trade talks will probably be delayed  beyond the July 8-10 summit, International Trade and Industry  Minister Hata told a press conference.    But he added Japan could reach accord on "the overall  direction" of bilateral auto trade during a meeting between  Prime Minister Tstutomu Hata and U.S. President Bill Clinton to  be held along with the Naples summit.    Japan previously expressed hope that talks on auto trade and  two other priority framework sectors -- government procurement  and insurance -- will be settled before the Naples G-7 meeting.    "There should be flexibility in bilateral framework  negotiations," Hata said.    On Japan's economy, Hata said "the biggest concern" is a  strong yen.    Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno depicted a brighter  economic prospect in his latest press conference amid an  emerging sign of a recovery in various industrial sectors, Hata  said.    But he added small companies are still struggling under the  lingering uptrend of the yen against the dollar.</p>

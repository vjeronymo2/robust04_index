			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / Unbroken growth for Great Universal Great Universal Stores, the mail order and financial services group, has extended its 46-year record of consistent growth with a 9.4 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 518.9m for the year to March. But the shares slipped 25p to 562p on news that the company had no plans to spend its Pounds 1.46bn cash pile. Since GUS enfranchised its 'A' shares last year there has been speculation that it would buy in some of its shares, or pay a special dividend. Mr Richard Pugh, deputy chairman, said that a buy-in was 'under review' but stressed that it had not been 'fully explored'. He added that the group had looked at potential acquisitions, but the vendors were asking too much for goodwill. Dividends are being increased by 18 per cent to 13p, with a final of 9p, but cover remains above 2 1/2 times with earnings per share up 9 per cent at 34.3p. Last year, strong growth in operating profits offset the fall in returns from the cash holding, which was due to lower interest rates. Operating profits rose 17 per cent to Pounds 414m, and would have been Pounds 3.8m higher at constant exchange rates, but net interest receivable fell to Pounds 101.8m (Pounds 117.2m). Mr Pugh said the improving trend had continued into this year with sales and pre-tax profits in the first two months 'somewhat ahead' of the comparable period. But the company cautioned that consumer demand remained 'selective'. All the group's trading divisions turned in higher profits last year, with the home shopping contribution up 21 per cent at Pounds 194.2m, on turnover up 5 per cent at Pounds 1.95bn, and the finance businesses turning in Pounds 67.3m (Pounds 53.3m) at the operating level. Rent on its investment property portfolio rose to Pounds 56.2m (Pounds 51.4m) with the value rising 17 per cent to Pounds 850.3m. Profits from Burberrys and Scotch House jumped 44 per cent on sales of Pounds 200.9m (Pounds 170.6m), helped by strong growth in the Far East. Trading cash flow was down from Pounds 229.9m to Pounds 55.2m due largely to a Pounds 127m jump in debtors, particularly at the General Guarantee Corporation finance subsidiary. The cash pile slipped to Pounds 1.46bn (Pounds 1.5bn). BZW forecast profits of Pounds 575m this year for earnings per share of about 38p. Lex Page 16</p>

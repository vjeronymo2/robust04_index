The goal of setting up this group -- as a  party organizational structure, without legal status -- is to  ensure the support of the locally elected representatives of  this party by the central party leadership and the county  branches, so as to enable them to optimally carry out their  activity in town halls and to implement PAC policies in the  sphere of local administration.    A communique released by PAC announces that the meeting was  attended by PAC President Professor Nicolae Manolescu, members  of the Steering Collegium, parliamentarians, 47 mayors and  deputy mayors, vice presidents of county councils, and the  presidents of the party's county branches.    In conclusion, the meeting endorsed and released an appeal  to  the citizens of the localities administered by the PAC  representatives as well as a statement of the Group of PAC  Mayors and Deputy Mayors. The statement points out that the  local autonomy proclaimed by Law 69/1991 of Romania's  Constitution has never taken effect. The disastrous situation  of the country's localities, which are devoid of sources of  income, is mainly due to the constant blocking of a package of  laws of utmost importance for the normal functioning of the  local councils. The statement draws the attention of the  leadership of the Local Public Administration Department on the  negative effects of this obstructionist policy, which is mainly  felt by the population. The statement also stresses that the  group of PAC mayors and deputy mayors will constantly promote  the idea of the need for legislation to facilitate real local  autonomy. The group considers it as its duty to appeal to all  national and international forums capable of influencing the  policy of the current government.    In conclusion, the statement expresses the conviction that  their colleagues from other parties or with similar political  viewpoints will join the efforts of the PAC mayors and deputy  mayors.</p>

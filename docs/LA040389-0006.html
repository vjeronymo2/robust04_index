			<p><P> April 3, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION;  </P> <P> TRULY EXPECTED TO BE NAMED NASA CHIEF  </P> <P> President Bush is expected to name Navy Adm. Richard H. Truly to head NASA,  Administration sources said, which would make him the first astronaut to head  the space agency. Truly, associate administrator for spaceflight at the  National Aeronautics and Space Administration, is expected to be nominated for  the post this week, said officials, who declined to be identified. He would  succeed James C. Fletcher, who retired from the post after holding it for more  than two years. Truly was pilot of the second space shuttle flight -- a two-day  mission in 1981 -- and commander of the eighth flight, the first night launch  and landing mission, in 1983. He is credited with playing a major role in  returning the United States to manned spaceflight after the Challenger disaster  on Jan. 28, 1986.  </P></p>

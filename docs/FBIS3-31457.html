			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Kresimir Zubak, president of the Croat </F> republic of Herceg-Bosna Presidential Council, with unidentified  correspondent; Zubak is in studio in Siroki Brijeg, Bosnia, the  correspondent is in the Zagreb studio -- live]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Correspondent] The  extraordinary session ended around 2100 this evening. As we  have heard, there was a lot of talk about the role of the  Presidential Council. What was so controversial?    [Zubak] You see, deputies were unclear about two issues. The  first one was whether this abolishes the position of president  of the republic. The second was who was to appoint members of  the Presidential Council. Both issues have been clarified.    The proposed amendment to the fundamental decision on the  establishing of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna specifies  that the position of president of the republic still exists, but  that a new body -- the Presidential Council -- is introduced.  Concerning the appointment of president of the republic, it was  clearly stated that the Presidential Council appoints the  president of the republic, and that the Chamber of Deputies  verifies the appointment.    [Correspondent] Perhaps we should specify what the status of  Mate Boban is now.    [Zubak] At a session of the Chamber of Deputies in Livno on  8  February, Mate Boban put his mandate into the hands of the  deputies of the Chamber of Deputies. In connection with that,  at today's session the Chamber of Deputies decided that there  were extraordinary circumstances and that during extraordinary  circumstances the Presidential Council takes over the functions  of president of the republic. Therefore, the post of president  of the republic still exists, and Mate Boban, who has held that  post so far, still remains the president of the republic, but  with the status that I have just specified.

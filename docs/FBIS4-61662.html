			<p>BFN     [Text] Chisinau, BASAPRESS, 5/5/1994 -- Turkey provided  equipment for a printing house in Moldova to print newspapers in  Turkish with Latin script, stated to reporters Umut Arik,  ambassador and chairman of the "Tica" International Cooperation  Agency of the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs. According to  Arik, Turkey intends to open a Moldovan-Turkish Center of  Culture in Chisinau. The Turkish Government provided $50,000 for  the construction of a brick factory. This sum represents only  half of a loan granted by the Turkish Government. Goods  produced in the East pass through Moldovan territory to the  European market. Therefore, Turkey is willing to finance the  building of a highway stretching 100 km to unite Moldova's  borders. It will be connected to the future Giurgiulesti Port.  "Turkey tries to assist properly and find finances for the  construction of the port," said Arik. According to him, Moldova  needs to improve its economy and especially its agricultural  sector. From 23-28 May, a conference for the businessmen of  Turkey and other countries will be held in Chisinau. It will  analyze the possibilities of investment in the Moldovan economy  and the legislation on foreign investments. According to Arik,  the "Tica" agency will prepare several projects for developing  the Moldovan economy to be forwarded to the World Bank and  European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. "Suleyman  Demirel's visit to Moldova to take place on 1 June proves that  Moldova constitutes a priority in Turkey's foreign relations,"  emphasized Arik.</p>

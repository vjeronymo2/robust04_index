			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / Leading Article: The reshaping of British Gas APART FROM the issue of British Gas's domestic gas monopoly, which the FT has argued (June 29) should be abolished, the Monopolies and Mergers Commission must make two other important recommendations: on a rate of return for the company's pipeline business and whether British Gas's structure is itself against the public interest. Structure is a central question. Some think that, even if its formal monopoly is breached, British Gas will, in its existing form, retain an unacceptably dominant position. Ofgas, the gas regulator, has argued for it to be split into a number of elements, including a gas pipeline company and one, or possibly a series, of regionally defined gas trading companies that would sell gas to homes and businesses. The advantage would be to open up further the market in gas supply, while placing the natural monopoly of the pipeline under impartial ownership. British Gas's position is that this would multiply costs without discernible benefit to customers. It wants to retain the monopoly, but has offered to split itself into five units for accounting purposes, with a view to reassuring the regulator that it is dealing fairly with competitors and customers. The company also argues that it needs to be large and integrated to compete on the world stage. In theory, the break-up argument has clear attractions and would be the right way forward were British Gas now being brought in to the private sector. But there is no denying that today it would also bring great uncertainties, not least for shareholders, and potential rewards which no-one, including Ofgas, has yet convincingly quantified. It feels like a step too far. Serious defects Equally, however, British Gas's position has serious defects. Accounting separation within a centralist culture like British Gas's might have limited impact, in practice. If British Gas also wins the argument for keeping its monopolies, it would rule out the benefits that competition can bring: innovation, better service and a tougher pricing environment. On the other hand, if the domestic monopoly is ended, an integrated British Gas would be so powerful that it would be able to frustrate new competitors. One compromise, already adopted in the industrial gas business, would be to require British Gas to surrender fixed percentages of its market over time, but that is a crude device which attracts regulated entrants rather than true competitors. Better at this stage to establish British Gas's pipeline and trading arms as wholly separate subsidiaries, so creating at least some of the transparency needed for a genuine market. In these circumstances, the threat of full-scale dismemberment could be held in reserve should British Gas abuse its position. Contrary proposals Whichever route is chosen, the MMC will have to determine an appropriate level of profitability for the pipeline monopoly. This issue has been enlivened by provocative and contrary proposals from Ofgas and British Gas. The right rate of return figure probably lies in the middle of these pitches, between 5 and 8 per cent in real terms, offering a premium on top of index-linked gilts without excessive reward for a low-risk business. Although new assets should be valued on a replacement cost basis, the company's assets at privatisation cannot be since they were sold at a substantial discount to book value. These are complex but important issues. British Gas's argument is, at core, that its customers are happy, its would-be competitors unimpressive and that it should be left to emerge as a great, international, integrated gas company, with interests from the oilfield to the showroom. It is an argument which might well appeal to the present government, but it ignores the fact that the combination of privatisation and competition has yielded rich benefits across the utilities in terms of efficiency, innovation, prices, service and transparency, and that the same process can be taken much further in the gas industry. Nor is there any evidence that size is a qualification for effective international expansion. The MMC and the government will be right to urge careful change, but badly misguided if they resist change at all.</p>

			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / Court to rule on Collor Nearly two years after former president Fernando Collor de Mellor resigned amid corruption allegations, the Brazilian Supreme Court today begins its judgment of the case. Mr Collor, who resigned in December 1992 hours before the Senate voted to impeach him, is accused of 'passive corruption' by the attorney-general, who has collected more than 10,000 pages of evidence against him. Mr Collor, who denies the charges, is accused of links to a network of bribes and corruption operated by his former campaign treasurer, Mr Paulo Cesar Farias, during and after the 1989 presidential election. Mr Farias, who will also be judged, fled to London in July 1993 after an arrest warrant was issued. He was later extradited from Thailand. If found guilty, Mr Collor would face a jail term of up to eight years. He is not expected to appear at the judgment, which could take several days.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although applicants may target female adolescents aged 10&hyph;21, provisions must be made in the data collection plan to disaggregate data for participants aged 12&hyph;21. Collecting data on females aged 12&hyph;21 will allow for comparisons with other SAMHSA programs targeting females.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In identifying female adolescents who are ``at risk'' for ATOD use, CSAP proposes this framework for considering risk (See Resnick, 1993):  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Risk factors are: (1) Those environmental forces that have a negative impact on the individual by producing an increased vulnerability to ATOD use. These include family dysfunction, including childhood physical/sexual abuse and incest; high risk neighborhoods/environments; and poverty.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Those visible indicators of problems in individuals, which represent the onset of potentially negative behaviors related to ATOD use and other negative outcomes. These may often be found in public records, and include poor school performance and involvement with child protective services, such as out-of-home placement in the foster care system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Risk factors for the use of alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs may be found in six domains: The individual, the family, the school, peer groups, the neighborhood/community, and society.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Primary prevention efforts for ATOD use should identify female adolescents who are affected by multiple risk factors (environmental forces and visible indicators). Secondary prevention efforts should target female adolescents who may have already initiated ATOD use or have engaged in other problem behaviors such as early sexual activity, truancy, or running away from home.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Recommended Approach: CSAP encourages applicants to develop comprehensive programs that will address one or more of the following questions:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. What combination of strategies is most effective in improving the self-image, including body image, and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generalized self-esteem and self-efficacy of female adolescents?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. What combination of strategies is most effective in developing the competencies or life skills of female adolescents in such areas as intra/interpersonal communications and problem-solving?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Which combination of strategies is most effective in improving the family functioning and strengthening the families of female adolescents, and increasing adolescents' levels of parenting skills so that they will be prepared to parent effectively and appropriately when they have children?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. What combination of strategies is most effective in combatting the long-lasting effects of sexual abuse/assault?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. What combination of strategies is most effective in promoting healthy life styles and life skills (e.g., negotiation, conflict-handling, self-assertion) among female adolescents?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These questions are in addition to the ATOD-specific questions listed in the Outcome Evaluation section of Part IV.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applicants are asked to involve representatives of youth and others in the community to: (1) Identify the risk factors for ATOD use that are to be addressed in the project and (2) select the appropriate interventions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Successful interventions should also impact not only on ATOD use, but on other negative outcomes associated with ATOD use. Related negative outcomes include adolescent pregnancy and parenting;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HIV/AIDS and other sexually-transmitted diseases; adolescent mental disorders, including eating disorders and depression; suicide; violent acts and criminal justice involvement; and homelessness. CSAP is especially interested in programs which will address physical/sexual abuse, teen pregnancy, and HIV/AIDS and STDs, in addition to ATOD use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Contact for Additional Information: Ulonda B.

Under this program priority area, applicants should propose prevention demonstrations directed to youth who are at high risk for becoming witnesses, victims, or perpetrators of violent acts associated with the use of alcohol and other drugs (AOD).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the purpose of this Announcement, CSAP defines violence as a public health, social, and economic issue that affects people of all races, ethnicities, and socioeconomic classes with enormous consequences to all Americans. CSAP recognizes that substance abuse is both correlated with and causes violence and that, in turn, violence give rise to substance abuse. Thus, substance abuse and violence are inextricably intertwined. Violence may be understood as any act that causes psychological, emotional, or physical harm to individuals and/or communities, or that causes damage to property. In this context, violence arises from substance use and abuse, the trade in illicit substances, racism, misogyny, homophobia, among other factors, and results in homicide; assaults, including rape and sexual assault; spouse abuse and battering; child physical and sexual abuse; child neglect; suicide; and vandalism and other forms of property destruction. This broad CSAP definition of violence illustrates the fact that violence affects its victims, witnesses, and perpetrators.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CSAP recognizes that violence is linked to a host of social and health problems that plague many communities; however, the Center is particularly concerned with the relationship of violence to the use and abuse of alcohol and other drugs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> April 27, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> CUBS' HARKEY LOSES NO-HITTER BUT BEATS PADRES  </P> <P> The Chicago Cubs have been expecting great things from Mike Harkey ever since  they selected him out of Cal State Fullerton in the first round of the 1987  amateur draft.  </P> <P> Harkey lived up to expectations Thursday when the rookie right-hander took a  no-hitter into the eighth inning against the San Diego Padres in the Cubs' 3-1  victory at San Diego.  </P> <P> Phil Stephenson led off the bottom of the eighth with his first home run to end  Harkey's bid to become the first Cub in 18 years to pitch a no-hitter. Milt  Pappas beat the Padres, 8-0, on Sept. 2, 1972.  </P> <P> After the home run, Harkey (2-1) was relieved by Mitch Williams, who earned his  fifth save.  </P> <P> Harkey, who was 2-7 during an injury-plagued season at Iowa last season, struck  out five and walked two in his third start of the season. He got his first  major league victory April 14 against the Pittsburgh Pirates before losing his  next start against the New York Mets on April 19.  </P> <P> Pittsburgh 2, San Francisco 1 -- Pirate left-hander John Smiley pitched a  three-hitter to keep the Giants winless at home. The Giants' eighth consecutive  home loss ties a club record.  </P> <P> Sid Bream drove in the game-winning run with an eighth-inning single that gave  the Pirates their first three-game sweep at Candlestick Park since July 11-13,  1983.  </P> <P> Houston 3, Atlanta 0 -- Craig Biggio's two-run homer at Atlanta helped the  Astros end a three- game losing streak.  </P> <P> Biggio's homer, his first, came off Derek Lilliquist after Eric Yelding opened  the fifth inning with a bloop single.  </P> <P> Jim Clancy (1-0) earned the win, allowing two hits in seven innings.  </P></p>

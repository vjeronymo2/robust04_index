			<p>BFN     [Text] Hefei, April 14 (XINHUA) -- Anhui Province, a major  farming area in China, has mapped out a series of new policies  to promote agricultural development and increase farmers'  incomes.    Addressing the annual session of the provincial people's  congress, Anhui Governor Fu Xishou said recently that the  province will continue to pay close attention to agricultural  production.    Fu said that the original land contracting system will be  further improved in line with specific conditions in Anhui.  Farmers can extend leases for another 30 years after their  contracts expire.    Furthermore, the right to use farmland can be transferred,  leased, used for mortgage or as shares of a company during the  contracting period, he said.    Land leases can be extended for 50 to 70 years if farmers  contract for wasteland and barren hills, he added.    Later this year, the provincial government will announce  other flexible policies for the land contract system.    The development of agriculture in the province will focus on  expanding acreage sown in high-yield and high-quality rice and  other grains, a provincial government official said.    In 1994, the province plans to plant grain crops on six  million hectares in order to harvest 25 million tons, matching  1993 production.    Anhui's cotton output is expected to reach 300,000 tons in  1994, about 40,000 tons more than last year. Its oilseed  production is projected to match last year's 1.56 million tons.    To meet these targets, Anhui province will try to raise  output in six existing grain and cotton production centers and  eight new ones listed during the 1990-95 period, the official  said.    Moreover, Anhui plans to choose 10 major counties, 20  agricultural production bases and 50 villages to undertake a  comprehensive agricultural development project, designed to  expand a diverse economy in rural areas, the official said.    He said that provincial authorities will make sure that 1.14  million tons of fertilizer and 7,650 tons of pesticide will be  supplied to local farmers this year.    The provincial government has also decided to help three  million poor rural residents solve food deficiencies over the  next three years and to enable them to eliminate poverty within  five years and lead a good life within eight years, he said.</p>

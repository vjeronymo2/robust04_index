			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Three Chilean and two Peruvian terrorists, who  were members of the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement and who  were captured last year by DINCOTE [Counterterrorism  Directorate], will serve life imprisonment penalties on charges  of high treason. The decision was confirmed yesterday by the  Special Military Court of the Peruvian Air Force, which reviewed  the trial as an appellate court.    The penalty will be imposed on Chileans Jaime Francisco  Sebastian Castillo Petruzzi, Lautaro Enrique Mellado Saavedra,  and Maria Concepcion Pincheira Saenz, and on Peruvians Heber  Celso Oliva Zelada and Segundo Nemesio Alva Marin, who were  involved in the abduction of Peruvian entrepreneur Raul Hiraoka  Torres and other crimes.    The public relations office of the Supreme Council of the  Military Courts explained that high treason is the legal name  for aggravated terrorism, "which because of its juridical nature  and its dangerousness applies to both nationals and foreigners,  because terrorism is a crime against mankind that is repressed  ex officio in all countries of the world."

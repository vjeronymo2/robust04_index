			<p><P> May 7, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> TOO HIGH ROLLERS?;  </P> <P> DODGERS' O'MALLEY MAKES A PITCH FOR RESTRAINT IN PAYROLL SPENDING  </P> <P> The Dodgers' recent recall of outfielder Chris Gwynn to replace the injured  Kirk Gibson did more than reshape the roster.  </P> <P> It provided the club with at least one player earning less than $100,000 a  year.  </P> <P> Gwynn has a split contract. He makes $80,000 with the Dodgers or $40,000 at  Albuquerque.  </P> <P> Club owner Peter O'Malley sat in his office at Dodger Stadium the other day and  attempted to make dollars and sense of a payroll that increased about 20% over  the winter and is baseball's highest ever.  </P> <P> He called for economic reform.  </P> <P> "The system we now have hasn't worked, isn't working and won't work in the  future," O'Malley said.  </P> <P> "The concern over player payrolls is real -- both on my part and throughout the  industry."  </P> <P> Is this at odds with the portrait of improved profitability painted by Peter  Ueberroth when he stepped down as commissioner on March 31?  </P> <P> O'Malley would not comment on anything Ueberroth might have said.  </P> <P> The former commissioner frequently cited the industry's economic growth during  his administration but never said that the system, as it pertains to player  signings and movements, was working. He obviously believed that it wasn't, in  fact, because it was allegedly under his auspices that collusion occurred.  </P> <P> Of the call for reform, Donald Fehr, executive director of the Major League  Players Assn., said:  </P> <P> "The system helped the Dodgers win a World Series last year. The O'Malleys have  become fabulously wealthy because of the system, and still they complain. I  don't know what to make of that. If anyone has no reason to complain it's Peter  O'Malley."  </P> <P> Said O'Malley: "Our club will continue to do fine, but for the sake of the  clubs in general there has to be a change. We can survive if the industry can  survive, but we can't survive in a vacuum.  </P> <P> "If we're going to have baseball in the smaller markets, if we're going to  expand, we have to find a system which allows both sides to prosper. I'm not  saying roll back salaries or bring back the reserve system.  </P> <P> "For a long time the owners had all the leverage and abused it. Now the players  have all the leverage. In many cases they're not being paid for performance as  much as for being in the right place at the right time.  </P> <P> "I mean, if they're looking at free agency in a year, it's likely they'll get a  three-year contract for a staggering amount.  </P> <P> "There has to be a middle ground. There has to be a better way to compensate  the players."  </P> <P> Preparing for expiration of the collective bargaining agreement at the end of  the season, the owners are examining their options.  </P> <P> Collusion is out. Faced eventually with major penalties for their sins of the  previous three winters, penalties that could erode Ueberroth's portrait of  profitability, the clubs reopened the market during the recent off-season with  a spending spree reminiscent of their undisciplined response to free agency in  the 1970s.  </P> <P> Baseball salaries rose about 14.6% last winter, the opening-day average  climbing from $447,291 a player in 1988 to $512,804.  </P> <P> So now what? Which avenue will the clubs choose within the framework of a new  bargaining agreement?  </P> <P> Salary caps? Revenue sharing? Tighter restrictions on free agency, arbitration  or both? Abolishment of one or the other? More equitable distribution of cable  TV money, such as the 12-year, $500-million contract that the New York Yankees  recently signed with the Madison Square Garden network?  </P> <P> O'Malley said he has some thoughts on the subject but wouldn't reveal them. He  will leave the inevitable war of words to others.  </P> <P> "We need to hold hands and work together," he said of management and the union.  "Instead of bashing each other, we need to be creative."  </P> <P> One of the creations the owners already have in place is a spring lockout date  if a collective bargaining agreement hasn't been signed.  </P> <P> "I don't understand the purpose of that other than to force the players to  accept a rollback," Fehr said. "I think the clubs have already decided to go  through the motions (of negotiating a new contract), then stage the lockout.  </P> <P> "They don't like free markets and it has always been their goal to convince the  players to accept a system that will produce lower salaries. I hope I'm wrong,  but they seem determined to provoke a confrontation.  </P> <P> "It may be posturing, but a bunch are already talking publicly."  </P> <P> And Fehr, of course, doesn't accept a lot of what he is hearing.  </P> <P> If baseball needs a new system, he said, why did 58% of the Texas Rangers, who  have never even won their division title, sell for an estimated $25 million?  </P> <P> Why, he wondered, is it virtually impossible even to put a price tag on the  Dodgers or Angels?  </P> <P> "Look at revenues," he said. "The new national television contracts (effective  next year) represent about $15 million to each club or more than $600,000 for  each player in the major leagues.  </P> <P> "That's before tickets, concessions, parking, licensing and local TV-radio are  factored in."  </P> <P> The average major league ticket sold for $7.17 last year. If every visitor to  Dodger Stadium spent a modest $12 for his ticket, food, gifts and parking, that  alone would be more than $36 million.  </P> <P> Then there's the $15-16 million from national TV, the estimated $15 million to  $18 million from local TV and radio, the $500,000 -- a figure rising rapidly --  from major league licensing, the undisclosed shares from appearances on  opposing clubs' cable networks and what is believed to be significant income  from the 400 acres that the Dodgers own in Florida.  </P> <P> O'Malley obviously isn't hurting. Neither is he crying. He is merely addressing  the industry's stability, speaking on behalf of clubs that do not own their  stadiums and do not operate in a market of Southern California's size.  </P> <P> And, he said, even the Dodgers cannot afford a 20% payroll increase every year,  cannot have the payroll double every two years, as his has.  </P> <P> Consider:  </P> <P>  -- The 1989 salary commitment to the 25 players, including the sidelined John  Tudor, who were with the club opening day is $22,193,555, the highest ever. The  figure does not include signing bonuses from previous winters but does include  $2,050,000 in signing bonuses given to Orel Hershiser, Jay Howell, Mike  Marshall, Alejandro Pena and Alfredo Griffin last winter.  </P> <P>  -- The average of $887,742 is also the highest ever, of course, and the  Dodgers are the first club to open a season with the entire roster earning  $100,000 or more. The Dodgers, in fact, have seven players making $1 million or  more.  </P> <P> This year, as well, in inheriting Mike Morgan's $375,000 contract from the  Baltimore Orioles, the Dodgers have broken a policy and accepted incentive  provisions. Morgan can make another $150,000 in award and appearance bonuses.  </P> <P> The Angels, believing that incentives help reduce guaranteed terms in some  cases, have a $12.3 million payroll but could dole out another $2.5 million if  every incentive is realized.  </P> <P> How did the Dodger payroll climb so far so fast?  </P> <P> Cynics might suggest that it was too low to start with, that during the  disastrous 1986 and '87 seasons the club ignored the availability of Tim Raines  and other free agents because of a commitment to collusion.  </P> <P> O'Malley, however, said that the Dodgers' commitment to winning has been  continuous, and that at a time when it is impossible to build strictly through  the farm system, supplemental trades and free-agent signings are bound to  inflate a payroll.  </P> <P> He cited the signing of Gibson to a three-year, $4.5-million contract and the  trade for Eddie Murray, who is guaranteed $2.5 million, $2.7 million and $2.8  million in the final three years of a five-year contract he signed with the  Orioles, who are believed to be picking up the $500,000 of each year's salary  that Murray has deferred.  </P> <P> Of the 24 active Dodgers, only 10 are home grown.  </P> <P> Is the club also paying a price for winning the World Series?  </P> <P> "I don't think that has anything to do with it," O'Malley said. "If we had lost  the World Series or lost the playoffs or finished second in the division, what  players would have been signed for less?"  </P> <P> It seems obvious, however, that the Dodgers' postseason success strengthened  the bargaining power of several players and made the club more responsive to  negotiation demands, including those of Hershiser, whose three-year,  $7.9-million contract will make him baseball's highest salaried player.  </P> <P> "We went higher than we planned with Orel," O'Malley said. "People say to me,  'Peter, you didn't have to sign him,' and I always say, 'That's fine, do you  have any other suggestions?'  </P> <P> "I mean, if we don't sign him, then he probably leaves as a free agent when the  season is over."  </P> <P> </P> <P> ANGEL CONTRACTS  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.66IN:2.22IN:2.33IN:2.11IN:3.98IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="5"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>

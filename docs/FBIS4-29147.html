			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Kim Boldokhonov] </F>   [Text] Ulaanbaatar, 6 Jun -- The aim of the newly created  Mongolian Democratic Rebirth Party is the renewal of the country  on the basis of democratic principles and taking into account  the specific conditions and tasks of our society at the present  stage, as well as the principles of human civilization as a  whole. Dashiyn Byambasuren said this today in an interview with  an ITAR-TASS correspondent. He opened the founding forum of  this new political force today with brief introductory remarks.  The former head of the first multiparty coalition government in  Mongolia's history set up an organizing committee with a group  of like-minded people, which submitted a report "On the  sociopolitical situation in the country and the tasks of the  party" and the draft rules and program of the Mongolian  Democratic Rebirth Party for debate by delegates.    We favor a state with strong democratic power, a society of  civic accord and genuine market relations in the economy. Our  party regards strong presidential power and a small, highly  professional parliament to be most acceptable for Mongolian  conditions, D. Byambasuren noted.    On the matter of collaboration with other political forces,  D. Byambasuren said: "We favor close cooperation with all  parties if our views are common or similar. The Mongolian  Democratic Rebirth Party favors the formation of a general  democratic front."    Moscow ITAR-TASS World Service in Russian at 1117 GMT on 6  June notes the following:    "Congress delegates adopted the party's rules and program  and  elected its ruling bodies. Dashiyn Byambasuren becomes chairman  of the party, and the publicist Luvsangiyn Purevdorj its general  secretary. With this the congress concluded its work."</p>

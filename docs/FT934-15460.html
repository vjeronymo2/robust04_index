			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Lambeth starts action for damages LAMBETH, the Labour-controlled south London council, yesterday started legal action against four defendants including one of its contractors, claiming damages for fraud. The council was accused earlier this year by its district auditor of spending Pounds 20.2m unlawfully. The council said the proceedings resulted from 'recent investigations by Lambeth itself into corrupt practices involving a contractor working with the disbanded integrated building services unit in the Directorate of Operational Services'. The council said the action was 'a major step forward' in pursuing its policy of 'taking all possible action to eliminate corruption and malpractice wherever it is found'. Following an application to the High Court, Lambeth is now empowered 'to locate and seize all relevant documents and other items from various premises and to identify and freeze a significant proportion of the assets of each of the defendants'. The council said: 'This is the first occasion on which Lambeth council has sought to utilise these particular powers, and it is believed that this is the first time any local authority has taken such action.' The defendants cannot be named for legal reasons. In June, Lambeth appointed a Mr Henry Gilby chief executive. He said then that 'significant changes' would be needed 'to put this council on a sound footing'. He had collaborated with his predecessor, Mr Herman Ouseley, now chief executive of the Commission for Racial Equality, in producing a report which said that corruption and malpractice on an 'unprecedented' scale had cost the borough more than Pounds 10m.</p>

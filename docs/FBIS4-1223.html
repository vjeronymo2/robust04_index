			<p>BFN     [Text] Vancouver April 24 SAPA -- As many as 200,000 North  American residents could be voting in the April 26-28 election,  according to South African Embassy estimates in Washington and  Ottawa. Those and other expatriates round the world were so  numerous, they could influence the outcome of the election, the  South African ambassador to Canada, Andre Kilian, told the  VANCOUVER SUN newspaper.    Large advertisements last week in United States and Canadian  newspapers gave South African expatriates and refugees the  locations of polling stations throughout both countries, some  specially set up in centres where there are no consulates.    The advertisements indicated U.S. and Canadian residents  would be allowed to vote even if they had become citizens of  those countries, provided they produced documentary proof they  were once South Africans.    Although neither embassy could give official numbers, both  offered rough estimates based largely on the host governments'  census data. These put the numbers of eligible South African  voters at about 100,000 in each country, totalling 200,000.    The sheer volume of enquiries to telephone numbers provided  in the advertisements indicated a high rate of expatriate  voting, the Washington and Ottawa embassies said. "I just hope  we have enough ballot papers," Mr Kilian said, but added there  was a "contingency plan" in case of a shortage.</p>

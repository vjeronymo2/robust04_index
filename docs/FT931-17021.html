			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / State of the Art: Raiders of the cultural past - European theatre: multi-cultural views / Here the directors are the stars. Language is no longer the route to meaning: dramatic impetus is visual, physical or 'grosses legumes', as the French say - on the Paris stage are a Briton rewriting a French opera, an Egyptian making a film show on the sacred boards of the Comedie Francaise, and an American directing German actors in a language they have never spoken before. Peter Brook's Impressions of Pelleas, Yossif Chahine's Caligula and Bob Wilson's Dr Faustus are stamped with the vision of three of Europe's greatest directors. In all, multi-cultural strangeness and splendour intoxicates, hints at shifting perspectives, changing realities. In Faustus, three actors simultaneously play the hero; Pelleas has different actresses - Chinese, Japanese, Korean - as the heroine on consecutive nights. It is drama as haphazardly personal, fluid, unfixed. It is also highly stylised, presenting a deliberately unreal imaginative world. Here is the director as star: after 30 seconds you see at once Wilson's hallmark - cold artifice - or Brook's mix of the exotic and intimately simple. Drama, with its demand that the director realise his own view of a play, has always been a deconstructionist's paradise. But among Europe's theatre pioneers, we now see a late 20th century trend which parallels post-modern developments in other arts. One feature is a move away from the straight play to a collage of devices - mime, acrobatics, dance, rock, film. Mostly these imposed stylisations - the pleasure lies in the aesthetic pattern, unity of music, movement, design, not in story or naturalistic character. A director such as Chahine makes political points this way; others, such as Wilson, are aesthetes offering no meaning beyond the stage. All are part of a post-modern trend in which language is no longer the main route to meaning; dramatic impetus is not verbal but visual, physical, spiritual. Multi-culturalism is at the core of this phenomenon in Europe. It embodies relativity of meaning, and it liberates directors from traditional texts and conventional staging. It is no chance that the explorers are multi-lingual: Brook, Wilson, Chahine, Ruth Berghaus, Peter Zadek, Luc Bondy may work in French, German, English. The most exciting shows in Europe are translations, radical revisions - Brook chops Debussy's opera in half and plays it with just a piano - or works which barely have a text. All reflects a sense of fragmentation throughout politics and culture. Brook's Paris Tempest, with magic, acrobatics, an Indian Prospero, a black Ariel, showed how translation turned Shakespeare 'into something rich and strange'. For Pelleas the cavernous Bouffes du Nord venue is a fin-de-siecle bourgeois interior with Persian carpets, Chinese vases and Japanese screens. Fixing the oppressive mood of Maeterlinck's play the oriental actresses playing Melisande are women from another milieu; the acting, trembling, precise, understated, recalls the Tempest; gestures, eyes looking away suggest souls - Prospero, Pelleas - lost in themselves. The essential is unexpressed but subtly evoked - perfect for Maeterlinck's symbolist theatre of silence, and for Brook's vision of intimacy and foreboding. Where Brook has exoticism, Wilson has an abstract finesse at once sophisticated and naive. His surrealism owes a debt to Tadeusz Kantor, whose apocalyptic view of history as a cacophony of mass terror is enacted by black and white ghost-figures miming or jerking into action as in early movies to the jangle of guns, machines or folk music; there is no text. Kantor's great Krakow show, Today's My Birthday, still tours Europe. It echoes in Wilson's masterpiece, The Black Rider and in the weaker Dr Faustus. Wilson's figures, chalky faced, eyes blackened, move in irregular jumps. The motif is cold angularity - crooked chairs six feet high, trees as scissor cut-outs, costumes with jagged edges, a red stiletto heel jutting from a slit in a box. Music, mime, dance, starts and stops abruptly. But it is also an enticing nursery rhyme world: pink neon, a big pulpy moon; the devil in Faustus, the lovers in The Black Rider, float upstage on swings. The limit of language is Wilson's obsession. In the 'spoken opera' Faustus, a German cast who first had to learn English, chant monosyllabic verse as parrot grammar, maddeningly meaningless. In Wilson's new show, a musical Alice in Wonderland, 'a word means just what I choose it to mean'. For The Black Rider William Burroughs' banal German-English ballads match the fairground kitsch of Tom Waits' tunes. It is art for art's sake, but Wilson's brittle-cruel-romantic collages work because they dramatise love, death, in a brilliantly realised, unified imagery. Only Ruth Berghaus equals Wilson's intense abstraction. Her Hamburg Jungle of Cities is a Brecht collectors item, a mechanised choreographic nightmare where words hardly matter. A criss-cross of railway lines is backed by a silhouette of skyscrapers; people enter via windows, fall into pits, as a huge tent moves menacingly across the stage to devour all: a surreal updating of Brecht's alienation effect. The cityscape is the theatrical image of our time. Most influential has been Peter Zadek's in his Vienna Merchant of Venice, relocated to Wall Street as a satire on yuppies and a parable of survival in a brash society. The set parodies post-modern architecture - a Richard Rodgers dream bank of steel tubes, glass frames, mirrored panels rises to the loft of the stage - and has sent deconstructionist echoes through many productions. The giant lift-mirror in Bondy's Berlin Final Chorus, for example, reflects both the mad looking glass world of bourgeois society and the audiences reaction to it. Chahine's Caligula is the pinnacle of this style. A huge tower block is also a screen projecting a modern city, moving crowds, Caligula magnified as a crazed dictator. At the end, this terrific structure disintegrates in flames, casting out changing images, different in each part of the auditorium. It suggests how random is our vision - sideshows range from Arab tambourinists to punk acrobats - and how we distance terror as it is stylised by televisual repetition. Caligula wittily and vibrantly uses non-traditional theatre forms to deconstruct our culture; the set is an emblem of the theme. It pinpoints a new visual, physical drama which should spread further this decade. Since European theatre thrives on cultural exchange, and language is of secondary importance, it is to be hoped that more such pieces - only Pelleas is planned for Glasgow - will visit Britain.

			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / Serb referendum holds key to republic's power struggle SERBS yesterday voted in a referendum on whether to hold early elections - the outcome of which will play an important role in determining whether United Nations sanctions against Yugoslavia will be lifted. Confusion yesterday appeared to grip Belgrade, the Serbian capital, because many people were uncertain whether to vote in the snap referendum called by Serbia's ruling Socialists under the control of Serbia's President Slobodan Milosevic. Mr Milan Panic, the Yugoslav federal prime minister, and Mr Dobrica Cosic, the president of Yugoslavia, both favour early elections to get rid of Mr Milosevic, who is seen by the international community as most responsible for the war in Bosnia. Yesterday Mr Andrei Kozyrev, Russia's foreign minister, and peace negotiators Mrs Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen said in Moscow that UN sanctions could be lifted if Mr Panic gained the upper hand against hardline Serbs. They also indicated sanctions might be eased to help people survive the winter. If the referendum fails, Mr Milosevic could remain in office for three more years. It would be a blow to Mr Panic and Mr Cosic who have pledged to get UN sanctions lifted and democratise Serbia. The Socialists called the referendum in the belief it would fail and enable them to remain in power at a time when the Serbian economy is collapsing under the strain of war and sanctions, which include an oil embargo. The rules require a majority of registered voters to vote Yes. It was unlikely more than 3.5m people would vote Yes after Serbian television, under Mr Milosevic's control, had denied publicity to the referendum. Ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 per cent of the 2.1m population of the southern province of Kosovo, yesterday ignored the ballot, heeding a boycott of Serbian institutions ordered by pro-independence Albanian leaders. Some of Serbia's fragmented and weak opposition leaders also called for a boycott. Turnout was reported to be moderate. Results are due to be announced tomorrow. Some 400,000 refugees, emigres and Serbs in former Yugoslav republics are eligible to vote.</p>

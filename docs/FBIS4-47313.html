I. Adamatskiy, St. Petersburg State </F> University; UDC 519.713]    [Abstract] Cellular automata are discrete mathematical  models of multi-component natural and artificial systems  consisting of a large number of relatively simple elements  linked locally into regular structures. Cellular automata may be  applied to parallel asynchronous computation or image  processing. This article examines an algorithm to model  multi-dimensional deterministic finite asynchronous cellular  automata with memory in a Turing machine with one-dimensional  tapes (Turing machines without memory are also considered).  Turing machines are claasical devices for evaluating the  complexity of calculations. Estimates are obtained for the  spatial and temporal complexity of modeling. It is found that  the number of cell states, the size of the vicinity around a  cell used to determine its state, the amount of memory, and the  maximum delay as a cell changes from one state to another are  either constant or vary insignificantly as the number of cells  increases. Formulas are presented which are useful in evaluating  the complexity of modeling asynchronous cellular automata with  memory. Examples of the modeling of multi-component systems are  presented. The case of a network of cellular automata is  considered. Figures 8; references 16: 8 Russian, 8 Western.</p>

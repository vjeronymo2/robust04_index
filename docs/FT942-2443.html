			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Rail union may call more strikes despite talks RMT, the railway union, may decide to extend its campaign of one-day strikes after weekend talks with Railtrack failed to bridge what negotiators describe as an 'enormous gap' between the two sides of the pay dispute. Railtrack, which operates the railway infrastructure, is to resume talks with the union early this evening at the offices of Acas, the conciliation service, in a final effort to avert a second 24-hour shutdown of the network on Wednesday. Railtrack's board is to meet this morning after the company's negotiators said at the weekend they would reconsider the costings behind the pay offer to signal staff. Under industrial relations law, the union has to give seven days' notice of any industrial action. That gives it the next two days to decide whether to call a third strike for a week on Wednesday. For their part, Railtrack's negotiators are re-examining the costings behind their original offer to see whether they can offer signalling staff more pay in return for improved productivity. RMT insists that signalling staff should have an 'up-front' payment of 11 per cent before entering talks on a longer-term offer linked to changes in working practices to boost productivity. Railtrack says it can only offer 2.5 per cent now for all its employees. It has told the signal staff that it will offer substantial but self-financing rises of at least 11 per cent once changes in working practices are agreed. However, 7 1/2 hours of talks on Saturday failed to achieve a breakthrough in spite of Acas officials' attempts to establish common ground between the two parties. Railtrack insisted on a 48-hour adjournment of the negotiations. Union officials were annoyed at the delay. The rail union is convinced that Railtrack's industrial relations executives lack the full authority to negotiate, and have to keep going back to the Railtrack board - and, indirectly, the government - to decide their next move. The weekend disclosures that Ms Jill Rutter, a member of Mr John Major's policy unit in Downing Street, attended a Railtrack board meeting last Friday at the behest of the Department of Transport has reinforced union suspicions that the government is involved in the dispute. The government took pains yesterday not to comment. Costs policy attacked, Page 7</p>

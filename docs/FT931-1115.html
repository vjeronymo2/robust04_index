			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Management: Down Under the weather In the land of the long weekend, taking an unjustified 'sickie' is an inalienable right, jealously guarded by workers who spend more time at the beach than at their desks. Is this an outdated image of Australia, rightly condemned by politicians and business leaders alike? Or is there a grain of truth in the caricature? The answer, it seems, is a bit of both. Anecdotal evidence suggests that abuse of sick leave provisions - the infamous 'sickie' - is widespread. In justification, most workers will point to the provisions of the national or state 'award' covering their industry, in which terms and conditions are laid down by the quasi-judicial Industrial Relations Commission. Many workers regard the sick leave provisions as an extra holiday to be taken regardless of good health. This view is encouraged by managers who rarely require proof of illness. There is little hard evidence that this free and easy attitude to sick leave has led to higher overall absenteeism than in other industrialised countries. Indeed, research* for the Australian government by Bill Merrilees and Dale Miller from Newcastle University suggests absenteeism is lower in many industries - banking, construction, distribution and services. But evidence is emerging** that absenteeism is a significant problem in the public sector, which includes most of the power generation and telecommunications industries, as well as public administration, community services and about half of the transport and storage sector. According to research by Mark Wooden, associate professor at the National Institute of Labour Studies at Flinders University in Adelaide, only the dangerous mining industry suffers worse absenteeism than these industries, which account for 87 per cent of public sector workers. Wooden says there is insufficient data to be certain about why the public sector should be more prone to the 'sickie' epidemic. But he suggests the reasons probably include more generous sick pay provisions, low job satisfaction, greater job security and less demanding management. 'I don't think Australians are lazier than anyone else, or any more inclined to take a day off,' he says. 'People are just responding to the incentives that are given to them, and in Australia the view is widely held that if the sick leave days are in the award, they are there to be taken.' *Report 7, Service Industry Research Programme, DITAC. **The Sickie: a Public Sector Phenomenon, and The Cost of Time Off Work in Australia; National Institute of Labour Studies.</p>

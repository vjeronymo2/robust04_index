			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Scottish Hydro advances 19% - Sales to England and Wales up 16% and represent 20% of turnover A SHARP rise in sales to England and Wales and higher than average rainfall helped Scottish Hydro-Electric, the electricity generator and distributor, increase pre-tax profits for the year to March 31 by 19 per cent to Pounds 146.4m. The shares, however, closed 2p lower at 344p. The dividend rise of 12 per cent to 11.38p was at the higher end of expectations. It was achieved on earnings per share of 27.6p (25.3p). Turnover was 7 per cent up at Pounds 717.8m. Mr Roger Young, chief executive, said the margins improvement had been helped by lower fuel costs resulting from a change in the fuel mix. The contribution of gas was 27 per cent, compared with nil in 1991-92 while hydro increased from 25 to 26 per cent and coal fell from 14 to 9 per cent. Operating profit was 18 per cent up at Pounds 112m. Mr Young said the company was examining whether to negotiate new five-year contracts with British Coal to replace existing ones with two years to run. Although new contracts would offer lower prices, comparable with those recently concluded by the generators in England and Wales, one option for the company was to import all coal when current contracts expire. 'We only burn about 1m tonnes of coal a year and can take a risk with imported coal as long as we keep reasonable stocks,' he said. Unlike most electricity companies, Hydro-Electric has kept staff numbers steady since privatisation two years ago but operating profit per member of staff has risen from Pounds 35,000 to more than Pounds 50,000 a year. 'We are showing we do not have to cut staff to increase profits,' said Mr Young. Sales in England and Wales were up 15.7 per cent to Pounds 135.1m, a fifth of turnover. Sales volumes in Scotland rose 2.3 per cent. COMMENT The modest 9 per cent earnings per share rise may explain why yesterday's otherwise impressive results failed to lift the share price. Dividend cover, at 2.43 times, is, after all, low by electricity company standards. However, Hydro is capable of increasing earnings by more than most in the sector and the quality looks good. Last year's superficially unimpressive earnings growth was depressed by the redemption of government debt; the underlying improvement was 21 per cent. In future the company will benefit from the sale of its relatively cheap electricity through the enlarged interconnector with England and Wales. That will increase further the proportion of profits from non-regulated generation, up last year by 18 per cent before cross subsidy. Assuming pre-tax profits of Pounds 170m this year, the dividend can increase to 12.7p, putting the shares on a prospective yield of 4.6 per cent and worth considering.</p>

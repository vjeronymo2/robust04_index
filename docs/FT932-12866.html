			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / China-Taiwan meeting is 'the first crack in their Berlin Wall' / The talks in Singapore today THE first tentative steps towards resolving more than 40 years of animosity between China and Taiwan are likely to be taken today when representatives of the two meet in Singapore. The meeting will be the highest level of contact between Beijing and Taipei since the foundation of the People's Republic of China in 1949 and the decampment to Taiwan of Generalissimo Chiang Kai Shek and his Kuomingtang (KMT) forces. The talks are described as unofficial and it is unlikely that they will mark any big diplomatic breakthrough. Nor is anyone suggesting that the years of mistrust between China and Taiwan are about to come to an end. But the meeting does have considerable symbolic significance. Even the delegates themselves seem in awe at the turn of events. 'We will be witnessing one of the historic moments of the century,' said one delegate. Mr Wang Daohan, leader of the Chinese delegation to the talks, said China is ready to offer Taiwan peaceful reunification. 'We stand for peaceful reunification,' said Mr Wang soon after arriving in Singapore. 'As both sides share the wish to develop cross-straits relations and realise peaceful reunification, there is nothing that we cannot sit down and talk about.' Western analysts in Beijing say China appears to have initiated a bold shift to a more conciliatory Taiwan policy, details of which are only now emerging. Various factors have prompted the change: China realises the substantial gains to be had from an alliance between its own fast-growing economy and a cash-rich Taiwan (Taiwan has foreign exchange reserves of more than USDollars 80bn (Pounds 51bn). China not only needs Taiwan's capital, it also needs its expertise in a number of fields. As China's trading power grows it is becoming increasingly concerned about access to markets and fearful of possible protectionism in the form of the North American Free Trade Agreement and the European single market. Beijing is beginning to see the value of a stronger north-east Asia regional trading axis which would include Japan, South Korea, possibly the resource-rich Soviet far east - and Taiwan. China's elderly leadership is concerned about the rise of an opposition in Taiwan demanding not only more democracy but also independence. Any such move is anathema to China. Beijing had always argued that its first priority was Hong Kong and that there was plenty of time to deal with Taiwan after 1997. This has changed: China's leaders feel that forces in Taiwan in favour of reunification are in urgent need of a boost. Taiwan also seems to realise it has far more to gain than lose by a closer relationship with China. As China's economy has opened up, investment from Taiwan has flooded in. According to the official New China News Agency some 12,000 Taiwan-funded enterprises have been established on the mainland with total investment of USDollars 8.9bn. Taiwan says that last year alone Taiwanese businesses invested Dollars 5.5bn in China while two-way trade was more than Dollars 7bn. Taiwan wants to establish some legal framework for the protection of such investments. Taiwan's KMT government is as anxious as Beijing to contain the rise of the opposition. It sees making moves towards reunification and normalising relations with Beijing as one way of doing this, though this also brings opposition accusations of 'selling out' Taiwan's interests to Beijing. The opening up of China and the easing of travel restrictions to the mainland by Taiwan has led to increased contact between people on the two sides of the Taiwan straits. Many of the big spenders visiting cities such as Shanghai are from Taiwan. Cultural, linguistic and family ties are still strong. Families split for the past 40 years have been reunited. According to the Taiwan authorities about 5,000 Taiwanese have applied for approval to bring their spouses from the mainland to Taiwan in the past two years. The Singapore meeting has involved much delicate diplomatic manoeuvring. It is believed to have been arranged by Mr Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's elder statesman, who over the years has managed to maintain close personal contacts with both Beijing and Taipei. Mr Lee has recently been emphasising the need for Singapore to invest more abroad, particularly in China. By playing host to such a meeting, Singapore's standing in Beijing will be considerably enhanced. Because Beijing refuses to recognise Taiwan as an entity in its own right, it is represented in Singapore by a semi-official body called the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits. For its part Taiwan is represented by the Straits Exchange Foundation, also described as a semi-official group. Much ground has to be covered before these two once bitter enemies become friends. Officials concede that it will be some time before they even have direct trade, transport or postal links. But Singapore marks the start of a process. 'It's something which would have been inconceivable only a short time ago,' said a Singapore-based analyst. 'In its own way it is a bit like the first crack appearing in the Berlin Wall.'</p>

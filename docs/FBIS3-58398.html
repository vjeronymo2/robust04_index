			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Loic Bouvard, president of the North Atlantic </F> Assembly, member of the Union for French Democracy, and vice  president of the French National Assembly: "A Historic NATO  Summit?"]    [Text] Nations which have demonstrated their willingness to  join the democratic club should not be kept out of the alliance  -- but Russia must not be isolated.    Did the heads of states and governments who gathered in  Brussels over the last few days on the occasion of the reputedly  "historic" NATO summit rise to the occasion? It is worth  repeating that the summit was first and foremost a test for the  U.S. Administration, on whose initiative it had been convened.  This was an opportunity for the United States to disclose its  "vision" of a European policy which seemingly had fallen by the  wayside since Bill Clinton came to power a year ago. The  imaginative and concrete proposals brought to the summit by the  Americans bear witness to a genuine commitment to their  responsibilities. To Central and East European countries which  have been fearing the consequences of an overly exclusive focus  on Russia, they offered a Partnership for Peace. To West  Europeans, they offered a possibility to carry out independent  actions using NATO resources.  <H5>  Central Europe </H5>   European partners of the United States within NATO,  including  France, were appreciative of this American effort at rethinking  NATO. But will statements made at the summit be enough to  appease Western skeptics -- for whom the alliance is an obsolete  relic of the Cold War -- and Eastern skeptics -- who, on the  contrary, view it as a promise of stability and peace for the  future?    Everything will hinge on the way the decisions made in  Brussels are implemented. If it helps Central and East European  countries in transforming their military structures, if it  harmonizes their defense capabilities with those of NATO, if it  lays the foundation for joint operations, if it contributes to  the necessary renewal of attitudes within post-Soviet military  institutions, the Partnership for Peace will have done more for  its intended beneficiaries than grand statements or promises of  assistance which no one will feel constrained to keep.  Nevertheless, nations which have demonstrated that they are  willing and able to join the democratic club should not be kept  out of the alliance.    For Central and East European countries, and especially  would-be members of the European Union, the Partnership for  Peace must lead to full integration into the alliance.  Confining these countries to the sidelines for a long time  would only undermine the faith their governments and citizens  have placed in the values of democracy and free enterprise, and  would create a zone of instability which would one day bring  grief to the whole of Europe.    While it is essential to avoid making Central Europe feel  ignored, it is just as crucial to avoid isolating Russia.  Should Russia come to feel cornered, it not only would become  far less predictable, but would also accumulate colossal  resentment against the West. Convinced of Western malevolence  toward it, it would undoubtedly attempt to recreate a buffer  zone through reasserting control over neighboring countries. Of  course, its support at the UN Security Council, which alliance  countries have managed to benefit so much from over the past few  years, would also be lost.    The experience of post-World War II Germany shows that the  best way to turn a former foe into an ally is not to humiliate  or ostracize it, but to bring it into the game after drawing up  strict rules by which it is expected to play. While Central  European countries must be given firm assurances of future NATO  membership, it is just as crucial to get Russia to commit itself  within a strong security partnership. The Partnership for Peace  makes this possible. It does not prevent integration into NATO  to happen at varying dates depending on the country. On the  contrary, it facilitates such a notion. It is up to each  partner to show, through active participation, how determined it  is to join the alliance.    Indeed, the guise NATO is most likely to assume in the  future is that of an alliance "a la carte." The types of  interventions which NATO will have to carry out in the years to  come, whether on its own initiative or under a mandate from  broader-based collective security organizations, will require  flexibility and interoperability of forces rather than permanent  integration of such forces. After a long period of indecision,  the U.S. Government has now acknowledged the consequences of  such a situation by bringing to the table the notion of  "combined joint task forces." Such forces, which would have the  ability of pulling apart from the integrated structure, could be  deployed under WEU [Western European Union] command for  interventions which the United States would be unwilling to take  part in.  <H5>  Bosnia </H5>   This approach is congruent with French aspirations, as  France  would like the European Union to assume responsibility for  conflicts which affect continental security. France will be  ready to participate fully as soon as command and control  procedures are defined to its satisfaction. Of course, it is  clear that NATO must keep the upper hand wherever the Americans  are willing to commit themselves.    So significant progress has been achieved for items on the  agenda. However, political enlargement and the reform of the  alliance's military structure will be credible only if NATO  demonstrates an ability to take concrete action when a conflict  breaks out on the continent. The summit's agenda did not  include the situation in the former Yugoslavia. France  correctly sought to remedy this by asking its allies to give  explicit support to the European Union's peace plan, and asking  NATO to renew its commitment to the implementation of UN  resolutions. Indeed, how can one remain passive while innocent  civilians are being slaughtered every day in Sarajevo and other  besieged Bosnian cities? More than once, the U.S. authorities  threatened the Serbs with armed reprisals, only to back down  thereafter. The Europeans, although primarily concerned with  the safety of their blue helmets, are increasingly reluctant to  bear the humiliation of being constrained not to use force.    For the alliance, averting its eye from Yugoslavia would be  akin to abdicating its very purpose. Indeed, its current  relevance will be judged by its determination to intervene,  militarily if necessary, to uphold the principles of freedom,  democracy and law.</p>

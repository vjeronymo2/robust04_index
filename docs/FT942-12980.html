			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / Select committee backs levies to enforce training targets Radical changes in industrial training policy are to be recommended by a House of Commons select committee tomorrow. The trade and industry committee, which will argue in its report that the decline of UK manufacturing industry can still be arrested, will suggest a levy on companies which fail to train their workers adequately. The government has consistently set itself against compulsion in training, but the imposition of training levies is central to Labour's industrial policy. The committee, in a wide ranging report which looks at issues including the role of the City and trade unions, says: 'Our preference is for a voluntary system, provided it can actually achieve what the UK needs.' There was some evidence that the UK's voluntary system was delivering improved performance, but the committee concludes that the UK's targets for training are not 'world class' and that there is some market failure in the voluntary system. 'There are market failures in this area, and it is too early to judge whether recent government initiatives will provide what is needed,' says the committee. 'Targets should be set on a sector by sector basis and, if it proves to be the case that companies do not meet these targets, the government should then consider introducing a compulsory element of training and some form of remissable payroll levy in the relevant sector.' Greater incentives to companies could be provided by additional tax allowances for training, possibly linked to the Investors in People standard, which seeks to assess whether a company's training programmes meet its business needs. The government should also provide more generous tax relief for individuals paying for their training. The committee says the establishment of national training targets, which aim, for example, for 80 per cent of young people to have achieved level two in a National Vocational Qualification by 1997, were an important step, 'but they are not world class'. It suggests the government should work with other bodies to upgrade the targets.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Simferopol, 23 June -- The session of the Supreme  Council of Crimea continued its work. The deputies considered a  series of decrees by the president of Crimea on transferring the  property of the Republic of Crimea under the jurisdiction of the  government. The majority of the deputies criticized these  decrees saying that they go contrary to the legislation of  Crimea and Ukraine. Crimean Communists' leader Leonid Hrach  accused Crimea's President Yuriy Meshkov of his desire to "pay  for the victory at the elections with the property of Crimea and  involve people in a war among the mafia clans." On the other  side, Crimea's President Yuriy Meshkov and his supporters at the  Supreme Council demanded that the members of parliament "fulfill  people's will," that the decrees be approved and no obstacles be  put in the way of the executive authorities. The proposed  variant of the resolution did not receive the sufficient number  of votes during the voting and was sent to be wored up.    After this the deputies considered the draft law "On the  Fulfillment of the Constitution and the Laws of the Republic of  Crimea." The discussion of this issue evoked a negative  response on the part of Yuriy Meshkov. Since the draft law  seriously restricted the plenary powers of the president of  Crimea, Yuriy Meshkov declared that part of the deputies had an  intention "to embark of the road of confrontation between the  Supreme Council and the president." During the voting this  draft law also failed to receive the sufficient number of votes  and was sent to be worked up.    Afterwards the deputies adopted "a resolution on measures to  stabilize agriculture in Crimea in 1994 and 1995 and on the  program for reforming the agro-industrial complex of Crimea." A  commission was formed at the session to study the issue on the  status of the city of Sevastopol. At the end of the sitting a  whole number of deputies criticized president Yuriy Meshkov for  his tactlessness and insults to the deputies during the session.    The next sitting of the Supreme Council of Crimea will take  place on 29 June.</p>

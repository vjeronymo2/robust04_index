			<p><P> April 25, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> INFORMANT IN LAWYER FRAUD CASE IS HIMSELF INDICTED IN U.S. COURT;  </P> <P> CRIME: PROSECUTORS SAY HE TOOK PART IN AN INSURANCE-BILKING SCHEME BEFORE GOING  TO AUTHORITIES.  </P> <P> A network television reporter last year introduced a San Diego lawyer to 33  million viewers as the "undercover government agent" who "infiltrated the  Alliance" -- a group of Los Angeles area lawyers accused of manipulating  lawsuits to defraud insurance companies of huge legal fees.  </P> <P> The interview by Mike Wallace of CBS-TV's "60 Minutes" was the highlight of  attorney Leonard Radomile's presentation of himself as a daring crime buster, a  white hat who went to the authorities as soon as he learned he had wandered  into a nest of crooks.  </P> <P> The government has a different version.  </P> <P> Along with 17 other alleged members of the so-called Alliance, Radomile, 43,  was indicted Tuesday in San Diego on racketeering and mail-fraud charges.  </P> <P> Some of those whom Radomile implicated took comfort in the fact that he shared  their fate. "Mr. Radomile is not lily white," a lawyer for one of his  co-defendants said in an interview.  </P> <P> But, if the tale of Radomile-as-hero was not complete, neither did the  indictment tell the whole story.  </P> <P> In fact, Radomile did work secretly with the government. He first reported the  Alliance to federal authorities. And he, along with two clients, gathered  evidence by secretly taping conversations with members of the group.  </P> <P> Radomile has recently refused requests for interviews. But his lawyer, John  Heisner, said Radomile is outraged.  </P> <P> "Leonard made the case," he said. "I can't wait until we get all these facts  out and demonstrate what Leonard's role was. If anything, he was a victim of  the Alliance and, like a good citizen, brought the crime to the attention of  the government, who then used him in an undercover capacity."  </P> <P> Federal prosecutors declined to discuss details of Radomile's cooperation. But  the indictment charges that he illegally profited from the scheme before  volunteering himself as an informant.  </P> <P>  According to Radomile and government sources, he went to federal officials in  Los Angeles in 1987, without requesting or receiving immunity. The indictment  accuses him of taking part in the scheme in the prior two years, 1985 and 1986.  </P> <P> There have been rumors of negotiations in which Radomile has steadfastly  refused to make a deal in which he would have acknowledged some culpability. If  true, that suggests the government believed it could not ignore acts he  committed before blowing the whistle, regardless of the risk that a jury would  see its treatment of a key informant as ruthless.  </P> <P> Radomile, whose story emerged from legal depositions over the past several  months, was briefly married to televangelist Terry Cole-Whittaker, the bubbly  former Mrs. California who coined the slogan "Prosperity, your divine right."  He served as chief executive of the Cole-Whittaker ministries before their  marriage broke up in 1984.  </P> <P> The events leading to his indictment began the next year, when Radomile became  acquainted with Los Angeles attorney Lynn Boyd Stites, the alleged mastermind  of the Alliance, also indicted Tuesday.  </P> <P> Radomile had just been dragged into the Willow Ridge litigation in Los Angeles,  a series of lawsuits aimed at recovering funds from investment promoter Barry  S. Marlin, for whom Radomile had worked briefly in the 1970s. Soon after  Radomile learned he had been sued, Stites' law firm called with an offer to  defend him, Radomile said in a deposition last summer.  </P> <P> According to Radomile, Stites said he was familiar with the litigation and  could persuade the other lawyers to drop him from the case. Stites was also  certain he could get Radomile's legal fees paid by insurance companies that had  insured Marlin's businesses, Radomile said.  </P> <P> A short time later, Stites turned Radomile's case over to a friend, former  Studio City attorney Marc I. Kent. Stites explained that he could not represent  Radomile because he previously had another client in the case. However,  although Kent would be counsel of record, Stites would work with him behind the  scenes, Radomile said he was told.  </P> <P> Over time, Radomile said, he grew uncomfortable with the arrangement. His case  had not been quickly dismissed, and he was also concerned about the chumminess  of some of the lawyers whose clients were opposing each other in Willow Ridge  and several other cases. It appeared they were going out of their way to make  these cases infinitely complex and expensive, Radomile testified.  </P> <P> About Christmas, 1986, Radomile went to see Stites to demand answers. He said  Stites warned him not to make trouble.  </P> <P> Stites had boasted of getting huge referal fees from some of the other lawyers.  So Radomile was shocked, he said, when Stites showed him sworn declarations in  which the same lawyers denied, under penalty of perjury, having a financial  connection with Stites.  </P> <P> By his account, fearful and angry at being muscled by Stites, Radomile soon  took his story to the U. S. attorney in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> During the summer of 1987, he and two of his clients wore hidden devices to  tape conversations with Stites and others. The tapes captured attorneys  discussing kickbacks to clients and efforts to control both sides of lawsuits  to assure huge billings to insurance companies, according to well-placed  sources.  </P> <P> That was Radomile the white hat. But earlier, according to the indictment and  sources familiar with the litigation, he had helped the lawyers infiltrate  cases and had gained from his dealings with the network. In the Willow Ridge  case, for example, insurance companies paid Radomile $585,000 to settle a  cross-complaint filed by Kent on his behalf, insurance industry sources  alleged.  </P> <P> And, for a time when Kent handled Radomile's insurance-paid defense, Kent was  paying Radomile about $10,000 a month, informed sources said. Kent pleaded  guilty to mail fraud in October, admitting, among other things, that he and  other Alliance lawyers paid kickbacks to some of their clients for the right to  defend them at insurance company expense. Radomile has said the payments were  for legitimate work.  </P> <P> Upon pleading guilty, Kent surrendered his law license and became a star  government witness. As a government informant, Radomile had helped bring down  Kent. Tuesday's indictment suggests Kent returned the favor.  </P></p>

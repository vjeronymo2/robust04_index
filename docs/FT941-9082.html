			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / International Company News: IBM in Unisys chip deal International Business Machines is to make semiconductor chips for Unisys, its long-time rival. The chips will be used in a new generation of Unisys mainframe computers. IBM will manufacture the chips, designed by Unisys, at its plant in Burlington, Vermont. It has been seeking new customers for its chip manufacturing business to leverage its investments in semiconductor production. The agreement signals the completion of Unisys's switch from older bipolar semiconductor technology to cheaper advanced complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) chips for use in its mainframe computers. IBM is also converting its mainframe products to CMOS. CMOS is the standard semiconductor technology used in personal computers and workstations. Until recently, however, it has lacked the speed and density of the bipolar technology used in mainframe computers. CMOS is now catching up with bipolar speeds.</p>

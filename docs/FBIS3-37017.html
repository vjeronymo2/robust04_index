The IAEA and Pyongyang still adhere to  opposite views on the possibility of inspecting the two North  Korean installations, where, the agency suspects, work is under  way to create a nuclear bomb. In such a situation, the  possibility of the sides' reaching a compromise appears unlikely.  <H3>  Pyongyang "has neither the capability nor the wish to create  a bomb" </H3>   In an exclusive interview with KOMMERSANT-DAILY, North Korea  ambassador to Russia, Comrade Son Song-pil stated that  Pyongyang, contrary to U.S. assertions, "has neither the  capability nor the wish to create a bomb." Up until recently,  he noted, the United States, in an effort to justify the conduct  of military exercises and to preserve its contingent in the  south of the Korean Peninsula, has talked about a threat to  South Korea on the part of the USSR and the DPRK. Now there is  no USSR, and Washington needs "new excuses." "The essence of the  North Korean nuclear problem," the ambassador said, was  explained by Great Leader Comrade Kim Il-song in his New Year  speech: It is the "product of U.S. hostile policy."    Pyongyang, however, believes that the problem can be  resolved  only through negotiations with the United States. According to  Son Song-pil, immediately after the consultations, a general  outline for resolving the problem was delineated. The DPRK  promised to suspend its withdrawal from the nuclear  nonproliferation treaty, stop using the nuclear reactor with  graphite moderator, and freeze all nuclear programs. Washington  for its part promised to abandon the policy of "threatening the  DPRK" by stopping its joint Team Spirit military exercises with  South Korea. At the same time, Pyongyang will agree to IAEA  inspection "on a limited scale." As the ambassador noted,  however, the IAEA has again "irresponsibly" demanded a  full-scale inspection, which does not correspond to North  Korea's "special status" under the nonproliferation treaty. The  United States, the diplomat believes, not only is not seeking to  adjust the IAEA's position, but has actually renounced the  obligations it assumed earlier, thereby violating the principle  of using a comprehensive approach in dealing with the problem.  And now, according to the ambassador, Pyongyang is right to  abandon its promises (although the decision to suspend the  withdrawal from the treaty still stands). As for the economic  sanctions, the DPRK, "which has a powerful industry, will not be  stifled." The United States, in the ambassador's opinion, may  try to exert pressure by military methods. Washington has  already announced its intention to deploy Patriot missiles in  South Korea and hold new exercises analogous to Team Spirit. In  this event the DPRK, according to the diplomat, will take  "adequate measures" (he did not specify which).    Son Song-pil also stated that even in the event of a  full-scale inspection (which will become possible only after  Pyongyang has returned to the nonproliferation treaty), North  Korea will not admit the IAEA to the two installations it wants  to inspect. He explained that only nuclear installations are  subject to inspection, while these two are not such. [passage  omitted]</p>

			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Revamped Borthwicks returns to the black Borthwicks mounted a sharp recovery in the first full year following disposal of its lossmaking meat interests, with pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.71m for the 12 months to April 2, against losses of Pounds 1.99m. The natural flavours company achieved sales of Pounds 29.2m, up 11.5 per cent on last time's Pounds 25.6m from continuing operations. The outcome took in losses of Pounds 117,000 on disposals; the previous year's deficit was struck after Pounds 3.08m of losses on disposals and reorganisation costs. 'This year saw Borthwicks for the first time focused on its future as an international flavours business and we are pleased with the turnround to profit. In operating terms this side of our business has always made money and we will continue to build on its reputation,' Mr Peter Brackenridge, chief executive, said yesterday. Operating profits from continuing operations rose 12 per cent from Pounds 2.03m to Pounds 2.27m, but rose only 2.8 per cent if losses by F&amp;C Hong Kong, a flavours and fragrance maker acquired in July, were taken into account. Sales in the UK market, which account for two thirds of turnover, remained flat although exports showed an increase of 14 per cent. Trading remained strong in the US where sales of Borthwicks Flavours USA rose by 16 per cent in dollar terms and 28 per cent in sterling terms. Earnings per share were 2.5p compared with losses of 3.8p. A recommended final dividend of 0.8p lifts the total by 8 per cent to 1.3p.</p>

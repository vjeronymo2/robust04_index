			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Watson &amp; Philip plans store expansion after 21% gain Watson &amp; Philip, the retail and wholesale food group, plans to expand its convenience store chain by at least 50 units this year, in a further move away from its wholesaling roots. The announcement came as W&amp;P reported a 21 per cent increase in pre-tax profits for the year to October 29, from Pounds 10.3m to Pounds 12.5m. The shares leapt 33p to 343p. The company has gone through several changes in the last year aimed at repositioning it as primarily a retailer rather than a wholesaler. Most important was the Pounds 21m acquisition of the Circle K chain last February. Circle K's advanced systems were extended into Allday, W&amp;P's existing convenience store business, and both groups integrated into a reorganised distribution network. In October, W&amp;P sub-contracted its Spar and VG supply business to four other wholesalers in a deal worth Pounds 21m over six years. The company hopes to add 50 stores to its 316-strong chain by the end of October, as well as 15 franchise stores, and may increase the expansion rate to 80 stores next year. Group turnover increased from Pounds 492m to Pounds 573.9m, thanks largely to a 36-week contribution from Circle K. Retail sales more than doubled to Pounds 154.7m, with profits increasing more than four-fold to Pounds 4.6m. Turnover at the food service division, which supplies hotels, restaurants and institutions, increased 3 per cent to Pounds 81m, but profits more than doubled to Pounds 1.5m as the gross margin benefited from a move out of fast food supply. However, profits fell 30 per cent at the cash and carry business to Pounds 2.2m on sales down 8.5 per cent. Earnings increased 20 per cent to 26p per share, and the proposed final dividend is 9.9p, lifting the total 7.5 per cent to 14.3p. COMMENT The market's enthusiastic response to the news from W&amp;P may be justified. The company sees a gap in the market for well-run and well-positioned convenience stores, providing for top-up purchases between superstore visits, and backed by similar systems and distribution networks to grocery multiples. The impressive performance of Circle K since its acquisition appears to support that claim. Convenience store expansion should also make problems in the cash and carry chain, whose small-business customers have been decimated by recession and the expansion of multiples and discounters, an irrelevance. Forecasts of Pounds 14.5m for 1994 put the shares on a prospective p/e of 12, and at a prospective yield of 5.5 per cent they look attractive.</p>

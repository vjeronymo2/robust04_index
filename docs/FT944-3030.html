			<p>941215 FT  15 DEC 94 / Survey of Charities Investment and Finance (1): Sector seeks new sources of income - As smaller charities follow large ones in seeking professional financial advice, all wonder how much they may lose as a result of the National Lottery One of the less noticed accompaniments to the frenzy leading up to last month's launch of the National Lottery was a complaint to the Advertising Standards Authority by the Institute of Charity Fundraising Managers. The institute objected to the extent to which advertisements promoting the lottery had linked the purchase of tickets with notions of doing charitable good. 'Every time you play the National Lottery, someone else gets a better chance,' they read. Charity fundraisers fear that the public, induced by the possibility, however remote, of winning a fortune, will buy lottery tickets in preference to alternative forms of charitable support. Yet when prizes, tax, profits and allocations to other causes are accounted for, charities will receive only 5.6p for every Pounds 1 lottery ticket purchased. Even so, the sums raised for charity will be substantial - an estimated Pounds 100m in the first year, perhaps rising eventually to three times this level. Unfortunately, however, estimates of possible losses commissioned by the voluntary sector point to broadly similar figures of between Pounds 190m and Pounds 270m a year. Finance directors of charities will be watching anxiously for signs of the lottery reducing their income. Even if fears about its impact prove to have been exaggerated, however, it is clear that the lottery will be no substitute for charities pursuing sound, efficient investment management and fundraising policies. The stimulus of recent changes in charity law, as well as pressure for the best possible return on investments, is encouraging a growing number of smaller charities to join big ones in seeking professional investment advice. Although small by pension-fund standards, the charities sector is a well established specialist activity for fund managers. A number of the biggest operators have several decades' experience of handling charity assets, and in some cases now have approaching Pounds 2bn of charity funds under management. Most have teams of charity specialists, and often offer facilities such as telephone helplines, which can make investment issues less intimidating for inexperienced trustees. Charities can, depending on the size of their investments, choose between common investment funds or individual portfolio management. Big London investment managers are likely to seek minimum investments of Pounds 1m-Pounds 2m to justify individual management, but are willing to accept charity accounts as small as Pounds 1,000 for common investment funds. About Pounds 2bn is currently held in common investment funds, and this form of investment is being stimulated by a phased process under which the official custodian, a public official, is returning to smaller charities money that had been held on their behalf. Fund managers remain concerned about the restrictive impact of the 1961 Trustee Investments Act, under which charities must maintain a 50-50 split between wider-range investments in equities and narrower-range gilts. Earlier this year, the government introduced some changes, largely to extend opportunities for investment in Europe, but it did not relax the 50-50 requirement. Ministers have rejected a call from a government-appointed task force on charity deregulation to abolish the requirement. The Treasury is, however, currently reviewing the position. As an alternative to scrapping the 50-50 rule, the task force proposed a revised division, enabling charities to invest up to 90 per cent of their funds in the wider-range category. This is supported by Mr Martyn Bensley, head of the charities division at Fleming Investment Management. 'The government could change the 50-50 division quickly by Order in Council, and should do so,' he says. 'There are other questions, like definitions of appropriate investments, that could then be considered over a longer period. If a charity had invested Pounds 2m on a 50-50 split when the act was introduced in 1961, its wider-range Pounds 1m would have been worth Pounds 15m in absolute terms by the end of last year, and its narrower range Pounds 706,000. In real terms, the wider range would be worth Pounds 1.4m and the narrower Pounds 65,000. That seems to make the case for a 90 per cent split in favour of the wider range.' Mr Bensley and some of his fellow fund managers would like the Charity Commission, still largely occupied with matters of charity law and accounting, to give more attention to investment issues. He has proposed the establishment of a panel of practitioners to advise the commission on investment questions. Questions about charity investment lock into a wider debate about the financing of Britain's voluntary sector and, more broadly, its future. Financial support from individual and corporate donors has remained generally flat for several years. Public funding, on which somecharities rely for much of their income, is tight, and the future holds fresh uncertainties. The Scottish Office, for example, has turned down proposals that new councils be required to retain existing levels of voluntary-sector funding when local government in Scotland is reorganised. Last month's Budget brought no relief on the issue of unrecoverable VAT paid by charities, although Mr Mike Fountain, partner in charge of VAT at Coopers &amp; Lybrand, chartered accountants, says that, because charities face a more complex VAT regime than the average business, some pay the tax unnecessarily on items such as building purchases, rent, equipment for research and advertising. Given the difficulties, therefore, in stimulating big increases in traditional sources of income, the voluntary sector is beginning to look to alternatives. A local investment fund was launched last week by Business in the Community with Pounds 2m from the private sector, including Pounds 500,000 from National Westminster Bank, and a Pounds 1m grant from the Department of the Environment. The fund will provide loans of between Pounds 25,000 and Pounds 250,000 to launch community enterprises, helping voluntary organisations to overcome their frequent difficulties in raising loans on the conventional financial markets. Elaborations of this idea, including a fully fledged charity bank, are emerging from work on the future of charities being undertaken by Demos, the think-tank. Demos's work is part of a flurry of examination about to burst upon charities. The National Council for Voluntary Organisations is setting up a Commission on the Voluntary Sector, to stimulate thinking about future priorities. The Central Statistical Office has commissioned a survey of the sector's sources of funding, expenditure and assets. A study of the financial governance of charities is about to begin, financed by the Charities Aid Foundation, the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants and the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. So, during the next two years, there will at least be a flow of new source material to fuel the debate about the future of the voluntary sector. It is a debate about absolute fundamentals. Changes in welfare service provision and government funding may be pushing some big charities to the point where they will look more like NHS trust hospitals, local-authority social services departments or private-sector residential care companies than the conventional public image of voluntary organisations. If this happens, it will leave a growing amount of traditional, campaigning charitable slack to be taken up at local level. But small, local voluntary organisations tend to face greater financial problems than their bigger counterparts, particularly when it comes to meeting core costs - donors prefer supporting specific programmes to paying electricity bills. As a result, staff of under-resourced smaller organisations often spend as much time fundraising in order to survive as on providing services. Charity's share of the National Lottery proceeds might be better spent on tackling the sector's infrastructure problems - for example, by financing top-quality management and staff training which would be available to the sector as a whole - rather than simply generating another lottery among 700,000 voluntary organisations that will be scrambling for a share of the prize.</p>

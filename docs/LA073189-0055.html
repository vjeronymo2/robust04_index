			<p><P> July 31, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY SPOTLIGHT: MEDIA / KEVIN BRASS;  </P> <P> HE DOESN'T CONSIDER HORSE OWNERSHIP A REAL HANDICAP  </P> <P> San Diego Union handicapper Jeff Siegel is a rarity, a handicapper who  occasionally gets to visit the winner's circle as something more than a  spectator.  </P> <P> As most experienced horse players know, Siegel is an active horse owner, as  well as a handicapper. Because of his dual role, he often handicaps races that  include his own horses.  </P> <P> "I don't think it conflicts," Siegel said. "I don't know what I can do to make  (the horses) run faster."  </P> <P> More than a guy with a small share of one or two horses, Siegel owns all or  part of 75 thoroughbreds, 35 of which are currently racing. He is also vice  president of the successful Clover Racing Stables, producer of several stakes  winners.  </P> <P> Siegel never mentions his ownership in the "comment" section of his handicap  column, although the information is readily available to anybody who reads the  fine print of the Daily Racing Form.  </P> <P> The main questions that arise from Siegel's ownership revolve around betting  because the odds are established by the amount of money bet on each horse. In  theory, Siegel could affect the odds by saying negative things about a horse.  </P> <P> "We have kept an eye" on Siegel, said Bob Wright, the San Diego Union's  executive sports editor. "The primary concern is, is the handicapper  undervaluing a horse to allow him to bet on it? We have never seen it happen  with Jeff."  </P> <P> Siegel is just one of many handicappers and tipsters used by bettors. His may  be one of the most prominent columns, but bettors are fickle and rarely, as a  group, rely on any one source of information.  </P> <P> "I can look at a race as objectively as anyone else," said Siegel, who supplies  handicaps to three other dailies in Southern California, in addition to the  Union. "I've never seen any evidence that my picks affect the odds."  </P> <P> Among horse players aware of his dual role, Siegel still has the one ingredient  essential to a handicapper: credibility.  </P> <P> "We are aware he owns horses," the Union's Wright said. "If he allowed his  position as an owner to interfere with his handicapping, he would be cutting  off his nose to spite his face. He would lose credibility."  </P> <P> An hourlong comedy special featuring weatherman Larry Mendte has been put on  hold by KFMB-TV (Channel 8). The show proposal was sent back to Mendte after  Channel 8 officials pinpointed areas of "concern," according to program  director Jules Moreland. A skit called the "Human Weenie Roast" reportedly was  one of the scenes that made Channel 8 nervous. In a Letterman-like stunt, the  script called for Mendte, dressed in a flame-resistant suit with hot dogs stuck  to the outside of it, to walk through fire. . . .  </P> <P> After eight years of exposing the double-dealings of San Diego's rich and  famous, as "the Inside Story" columnist for the Reader, Paul Krueger is leaving  the paper. Besides being "completely burned out," Krueger said he is "unhappy  with the way things have been going in the last year" at the Reader,  specifically the apparent de-emphasis on hard news. Krueger, also the local  stringer for Time magazine, expects to take a couple of months off. He doesn't  rule out working for the Reader in the future, but he has no plans to do the  column again. . . .  </P> <P> KSDO-AM (1130) afternoon talk show host Stacy Taylor is leaving the station to  take a midday job with WLS-AM in Chicago. "I wasn't able to strike a suitable  deal here," Taylor said. "So I had no choice but to look elsewhere." . . .  </P> <P> Anna Martinez, late of KVUE in Austin, Tex., where she was a weekend anchor and  reporter, starts this week at Channel 10 as a general assignment reporter. . .  .  </P> <P> Union-Tribune management has promised the Newspaper Guild that management will  bring a new contract proposal to the table within the next couple of weeks. . .  .  </P> <P> Among the locals mentioned in Andy Warhol's diaries: former talk show host  Stanley Siegel (Andy watched his New York show) and the late Lita Vietor, wife  of Jell-O heir and San Diego magazine co-founder John Vietor. (Andy met her at  one of the 37,000 parties he attended during the '80s.) . . .  </P> <P> Steve Garvey adds a "thought of the day" to each of his weekday morning shows  on XTRA-AM (690), perhaps attempting to give the show philosophical punch. It  needs some sort of spark. The huckling of new sports guy Jimmy (The Saint)  Christopher is not nearly enough. Given a choice between listening to static  and listening to Garvey do mutual-admiration interviews with Rolf Benirschke or  a scout from the Chargers at 7 a.m., static would be slightly more exciting.  After a month of doing the show, even Garvey sounds like he's about to doze off  during interviews. Most of the interviews are with jocks who, like Garvey, have  little to say. Here's a thought of the day: Garvey and Co. is boring radio. . .  .  </P> <P> The editor of a local publication, informed that a free-lance writer was in the  hospital, responded in typical editor-like fashion. "Does that mean she won't  be filing her story?" the editor asked. . . .  </P> <P> A $7.7-million price tag has been placed on North Coast Newspapers, publishers  of the Coast Dispatch and other North County papers, according to a letter from  a New York broker obtained and published by the Blade-Citizen. The  Virginia-based Times Journal Co., owner of the papers since 1986, is looking to  focus assets on its home market of Washington, according to the letter. The  broker is apparently trying to package the coastal papers with Pomerado  Publishers in Poway, publishers of several inland papers. Current North Coast  Publisher Bill Lyke confirmed that he is trying to put together a deal for both  entities. . . .  </P> <P> Jim Baumann, editor of the six North Coast papers for the past seven years, is  leaving to start a monthly magazine covering Encinitas. . . .  </P> <P> New KNSD-TV (Channel 39) news director Don Schafer is bringing in his own  assistant, Irv Kass, to operate as a managing editor. The two have worked  together at five other stations. . . .  </P> <P> KGTV (Channel 10) officials are discussing expanding programming to 24 hours.  </P></p>

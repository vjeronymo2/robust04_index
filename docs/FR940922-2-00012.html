			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Comment 9  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Respondent argues that the Department distorted its calculation by completely excluding the pastoral portions of the land from orchard cost allocation because pastoral activities are an integral part of the growers' operations which must bear an appropriate share of management, repair, and vehicle expenses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Petitioners contend that pasture land should not bear expenses because it requires little tending or investment. Furthermore, petitioners note that pasture land requires virtually no management, while kiwifruit orchards require intensive management activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> DOC Position <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We agree with petitioners in part. While pasture land requires little or no labor, it may require management and vehicle-related expenses. Accordingly, we have adjusted our COP calculations to reflect these costs in the final results. (See Department's analysis memorandum dated August 29, 1994, for appropriate adjustments.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Comment 10 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Respondent argues that the Department's treatment of intra-family interest and salary and other related-party expenses in the preliminary results is inconsistent and in error. Respondent contends that it has been the Department's practice to treat transactions between related parties as unreliable and to examine costs to a company as a whole and eliminate intra-company payments and transfers. Respondent argues that the kiwifruit growers' accounting is typical of a small business in that it is essentially tax driven. In particular, respondent argues that recharacterizing grower profits as interest payments and inflated salaries paid to family members are typical methods used to cut taxes. Respondent cites Growers 5, 7, 17, and 19 as examples of this practice. Respondent uses Grower 17 for analysis purposes and argues that the wages paid by the grower to his spouse are a paper transaction only and that his spouse is not in fact a farm hand. Similarly, respondent argues that the loan from Grower 17's spouse to the grower was a paper transaction to reduce taxes in which the wife pretended to loan her husband money and the husband pretended to pay his wife interest. Respondent applies the same argument to salary payments made to the son of Grower 19 and asserts that this is a profit distribution among family members. Respondent further argues that, for Grower 8, the Department should exclude interest that the owners paid themselves from the COP calculation because it was a distribution of profits to the owners.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Petitioners argue that respondent has furnished no evidence of New Zealand tax provisions to support its claim that the inflated payments are reported for tax purposes. Petitioners argue that the Department should not accept respondent's claim that some of the expenses are not real expenses when nothing in the record demonstrates this claim to be true.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> DOC Position <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We agree with petitioners. Absent specific evidence to the contrary, we consider expenses recorded in a company's financial statements to reflect actual expenses incurred in its operations.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See Final Results of Sales at Less Than Fair Value, Sweaters Wholly or in Chief Weight of Man-Made Fiber From Taiwan <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 55 FR 34585 (1990). Respondent has not presented any documentary evidence in support of its claim that the recorded expenses were not actual expenses. Accordingly, we continue to rely on the growers' financial statements for orchard expenses in the final results.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Comment 11 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Respondent argues that the Department incorrectly disallowed the rental income credit reported by Growers 8, 13, and 18. Respondent contends that these growers reported imputed rental income as a credit against their reported labor cost because each of these growers provided housing to their orchard employees. According to respondent, under New Zealand income tax law, employer-provided housing is considered a taxable benefit to the employee. As a result, the grower that provides housing is required, when submitting its tax information, to increase the reported salary paid in cash to the employee by the imputed value of the housing benefit. Respondent explains that, because of this calculation, the growers' income statement reflects a total labor cost that includes both the wages actually paid to employees, the imputed value of the housing benefit, and the growers' actual expenses incurred in providing employee housing. Respondent contends that this imputed housing value is not an additional expense to the grower. Respondent maintains that the Department misunderstood the nature of the housing expense and included both the imputed value of the housing benefit and the actual housing expenses incurred by the grower. Respondent argues that the Department erred in its COP calculations when it disallowed the offsetting credit amount reported in growers' financial statements to correct the employer's overstatement for employee housing expenses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Petitioners contend that the rental income credit is inappropriate because housing rental is not a farm operation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> DOC Position <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We agree with respondent. In this case, the growers provide a housing benefit to employees. Under the New Zealand tax laws, this housing benefit is considered a taxable benefit to the employees and its imputed value is reflected on the employees' income statements along with total wages. Although the growers' income statements reflect a total labor cost that includes both the wages actually paid to employees and the imputed value of the housing benefit, the imputed housing value is not an additional expense to the growers; the actual cost of the housing benefit, such as depreciation, maintenance, electricity,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> etc. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , is already included in the growers' financial statements. Since the growers' financial statements show an expense for the imputed housing benefit that was not incurred, the growers offset this expense with ``rental income'' to reconcile their financial statements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To include the imputed housing value plus the growers' actual expenses incurred in providing the housing benefit in the COP calculation would result in double-counting the total expenses for the housing. Accordingly, we have accepted this ``rental income'' credit adjustment reported by respondent for Growers 8, 13, and 18 in the final results.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

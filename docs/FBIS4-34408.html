			<p>BFN     [Text] Lima, 17 Jun (EFE) -- Peruvian President Alberto  Fujimori today said that during the Ibero-American summit in  Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, Latin America left rhetoric  behind and took concrete steps toward integration.    When speaking of the results of the summit, Fujimori said  that "the most important thing is that concrete measures were  adopted and this represents considerable progress toward  regional integration."    "This time the rhetoric was left aside and it was obvious  that each country was making an effort to form a Latin American  trade bloc to counterbalance the other blocs that exist in the  world," Fujimori said.    The Peruvian president said that the economic section of the  final document issued in Cartagena contains several proposals  "which were planned based on the experience and modernization  process of the Peruvian economy."    As for the political content of the declaration of the  Ibero-American chiefs of state and governments, Fujimori said  that the document "insists on the need for the democratic system  to work efficiently."    He also mentioned that "it has been agreed that it is  necessary to combat all kinds of corruption which, just like  terrorism, is one of the scourges that hinders development and  the efficiency of democracy."    Fujimori expressed satisfaction over the result of his  meetings in Cartagena with Ecuadoran President Sixto  Duran-Ballen and Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada.    He and Duran-Ballen discussed several plans that would  integrate the two countries, such as highways and agricultural  projects, while he and Sanchez de Lozada spoke about giving  Bolivia an outlet to the sea through the southern Peruvian coast.</p>

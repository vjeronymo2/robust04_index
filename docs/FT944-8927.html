			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / International Company News: Kidder disposes of mortgage bonds Kidder Peabody, the US investment bank, has disposed of a large part of its portfolio of complex mortgage-backed bonds. It has hired an outside firm to advise on the 'management and orderly disposition' of the rest. The bond sales mark a reversal of a plan announced in early October to transfer the bond holdings to GE Capital, another part of the General Electric group. Since then, General Electric has agreed to sell the bulk of Kidder's operations to another broking firm, PaineWebber. Kidder's said its holdings of the securities, known as collateralised mortgage obligations (CMOs), now stood at Dollars 4bn, down from Dollars 6.7bn at the end of October. In March, before the company began its sales, the portfolio was valued at Dollars 16bn. CMOs are complex derivative-type securities created from pools of mortgage-backed bonds. They have generally performed worse than other bonds as fixed-income markets have retreated this year. Kidder, has hired New York-based investment firm BlackRock Financial Management to advise on the remainder of the portfolio, but said it 'plans to continue to own and manage the portfolio for the foreseeable future'.</p>

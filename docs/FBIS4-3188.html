			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 18 (XINHUA) -- Veteran politician  Michio Watanabe said today he needs more time to decide whether  to leave the main opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to  run in an upcoming parliamentary election for the prime  ministership following the resignation of Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa on April 8.    Watanabe, former deputy prime minister and former foreign  minister, was apparently having second thoughts about his  defection plan now because his bid for the top government post  seems unlikely to succeed, KYODO NEWS SERVICE reported.    He decided on Sunday [17 April] to quit the LDP in an  attempt  to seek ties with the ruling coalition parties to achieve his  goal of succeeding Hosokawa. Watanabe had been expected to make  a formal announcement on his defection plan today.    Watanabe held a 65-minute meeting with LDP President Yohei  Kono today and told him he will consult with his faction members  on the matter, KYODO said. They may hold another round of talks  on Tuesday.    KYODO said an LDP official quoted Watanabe as telling kono,  "I understand your feelings, so please give me a little more  time to think about it."    The 70-year-old LDP veteran cited major differences between  him and the ruling coalition over security issues as one of the  main reasons for him to reconsider his plan to quit the LDP,  still the largest single party in the Japanese Diet (parliament).    Kono appealed to Watanabe to stay in the LDP, saying,  "unless  the coalition decides to revamp its combination of political  forces and accept you, your defection will be of no use,"  according to KYODO.</p>

			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Greycoat warns against rejecting PosTel rescue GREYCOAT yesterday reinforced its backing for the controversial Pounds 120m rescue bid by PosTel, the UK's largest pension fund, when it underlined the risks of the deal being rejected next Friday in a letter to shareholders and bondholders. The letter, which included an up-to-date assessment of the value of Greycoat's property in a forced sale, reinforced the company's earlier assertion that a winding-up would leave nothing for the preference and ordinary shareholders. It also said that the company has not had any definitive offers from another bidder. The letter also told shareholders it had sold its 6 per cent interest in Victoria Plaza, the office development over Victoria Station. Its share of the proceedings, which was Pounds 6m, has been used to repay the debt on the property. Several large preference shareholders continue to believe that the PosTel bid undervalues their shares. Their objections are that: The company is not facing a genuine threat of liquidation. Although PosTel is considered unlikely to improve its offer, they believe that the likelihood of another bidder emerging is strong. Some analysts believe Greycoat could salvage its position through a rights issue. This point is disputed by Greycoat. It points out that another bidder has had several months since the PosTel deal was announced to come forward. Also, it believed 'a conventional capital raising would not be feasible in the present circumstances.' Moreover, it might not have the time to put together an alternative rescue package. The complex structure of Greycoat's financing means that there are conflicting interests between the ordinary and preference shareholders, the zero coupon bondholders and the Brittanic bond holders. The recovery in the property market means that the value of Greycoat's portfolio has been understated. 'My view is that the company is in better shaper than it has been for years,' says Mr John Katz, a research consultant. However, Greycoat believes that in the event of a forced sale all but one of its properties would not share in the improvement in the property market of the last six months. The preference shareholders have been treated unduly harshly, compared with other interest groups. Insufficient information has been provided about the valuations of some of Greycoat's property. Greycoat, however, argues that to give too much detail about its buildings' valuations would not be in its shareholders' interests if the buildings have to be sold. The chance that shareholders will vote down the proposals next Friday is very real. Substantial blocks of shareholders including Gruss Partners, the US arbitrage house which holds 14 per cent of the preference shares and Goldman Sachs, which owns 8 per cent of the preference shares, are thought to be unhappy with the proposed deal. Another concern for Greycoat is that the vote will only go ahead if sufficient bondholders and shareholders have responded. But Greycoat and PosTel remain optimistic that the protests will be shown to be just posturing. They hope that voters will opt for the certainty of the PosTel deal rather than risk everything on the hope of getting a better outcome.</p>

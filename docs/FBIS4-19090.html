			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Text] Prime Minister Tansu Ciller has declared that  Turkey is a secular country and it will remain so, adding that  there is no argument about the government in the country.  Ciller also revealed that a new package of democratization  measures to encompass the entire country will soon be announced  together with Murat Karayalcin, state minister and deputy prime  minister. The prime minister left for the United States to  conduct contacts.    In a statement at Istanbul's Ataturk Airport before her  departure, Ciller reported that in the United States she will  meet with President Bill Clinton and hold a series of meetings.  She said that it is difficult to understand Turkey when you  look at it from the outside.    [Begin Ciller recording] Turkey is also a secular country.  The Republic of Turkey will remain secular. There is no  argument about the regime. Sometimes, it may be difficult to  understand our country when you look at it from the outside.  Another matter we will explain to the other countries consists  of the additional moves Turkey will undertake in the field of  democratization. I met with Mr. Karayalcin before my departure.  Upon my return, together with Mr. Karayalcin, we will announce  a package of democratization measures. Turkey will adopt a  series of measures which will further broaden the scope of  democracy within the framework of a state of law. In actual  fact, these measures were also included in our coalition  protocol. We will embrace these issues with determination.    Turkey is a democratic country and it has covered a great  distance in this direction. It will continue to do so in the  future. We do have economic problems, but we have already  adopted very important measures aimed at overcoming these  problems. Our whole nation supports these measures. Turkey's  future will become increasingly brighter and it will occupy its  rightful place in the world as a leading country. [end  recording]    Commenting on her scheduled contacts in the United States,  Ciller explained that she will deliver a speech at a meeting  organized by the Elie Wiesel Foundation in New York. In  Washington, Ciller recounted, she will meet with President  Clinton and hold contacts with representatives of financial  circles.    [Begin Ciller recording] The main goal of my meetings with  financial circles will not consist of asking for loans for  Turkey. The aim is to reinstate the flow of information  necessary for Turkey's reintegration into the world's money  markets. As you know, our country is experiencing a period of  economic difficulties. We are adopting all the necessary  measures to surmount this problem. We will implement these  measures as a nation, in solidarity. We will certainly overcome  the problems. Let no one have any doubts on this matter. We  may experience some ups and downs in the coming days, but we are  determined to overcome this. The necessary measures have been  adopted. We will experience certain difficulties for some time,  but, as I said, let no one doubt that Turkey's future is open.  Turkey is a great country.    I will explain the economic stability measures we adopted to  the other countries and to financial circles. I will inform  them that we are approaching this issue in a comprehensive  manner and in all seriousness and determination. Our goal is to  secure Turkey's reintegration with the world money markets and  to ensure that everything proceeds according to its normal  course. This will be achieved. [end recording]    Ciller took off for New York aboard a scheduled Turkish  Airlines flight. She was seen off at Ataturk Airport by State  Minister Necmettin Cevheri, Istanbul Governor Hayri Kozakcioglu,  Istanbul Mayor Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and other officials. The  prime minister will return to Turkey on 17 April.</p>

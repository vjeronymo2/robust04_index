			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / Observer: Bike worse than his bark Bjorn Wolrath's claim to have his finger on the pulse of Sweden's investor community looked a little less than convincing yesterday, when the first issue of government stock - a SKr6.5bn tranche of 7-year and 15-year bonds - to be auctioned since his announcement of a bond boycott by Skandia, was 100 per cent over-subscribed. What upset debt office officials in Stockholm was not Wolrath's anxiety about the state of the public finances, but his bald assertion that there was a risk that state debt might not be paid back. 'Wolrath is out on his bicycle,' was the inventive suggestion of one angry official. That won't bother him - Wolrath loves controversy. Last November, he played a very public part in knifing Pehr Gyllenhammar, as the former Volvo boss was desperately fighting to keep the merger with Renault - and his job - on the road. As Volvo shareholders, including Skandia, began giving the thumbs down to the merger, Wolrath and a colleague wrote a devastating critique of the merger plan in Sweden's top-selling quality newspaper. Cynics of Swedish corporate pond-life suggested Wolrath was settling an old score, as Gyllenhammar, himself a former Skandia chief executive, had been less than supportive when Wolrath was battling against a joint takeover attempt by Norway's Uni Storebrand and Denmark's Hafnia. Wolrath won that battle, thanks to Skandia's strange share structure, obstructing any shareholder from exercising more than one vote. But though Uni and Hafnia were seen off - and broken in the process - Skandia's remaining institutional shareholders have since forced the adoption of a more regular system, as the price for stumping up for a share issue earlier this year. Even Bjorn Wolrath needs friends some times.</p>

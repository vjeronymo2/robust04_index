			<p><P> July 14, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BASTILLE DAY;  </P> <P> RESTAURANTS IN FRANCE AS OLD AS THE REVOLUTION  </P> <P> It's a Frenchman's pleasure to dine out. And, in a sense, his patriotic duty.  </P> <P> The great revolution over which countless aristocrats lost their heads put  ideas into others, notably the brigades of private maitres d'hotel and chefs  facing sudden unemployment. In an era when it was dangerous to be less  revolutionary than one's neighbor, the cleverest among this new class of  unemployed disavowed their aristocratic ties and looked to put their talents to  work in patriotic ways.  </P> <P> Though cafes, which served the various revolutionary camps, are an older  Parisian tradition, restaurants, as we know them, are truly a revolutionary  concept.  </P> <P> Inspired, it seems, by a man named Boulanger who in 1765 opened Paris' first a  la carte restaurant on the Rue des Poulies, several restaurants opened (and  closed) during the years of upheaval. Some survivors are still operating,  remarkably unchanged.  </P> <P> Eat in any number of cafes or restaurants in the center of Paris today and  you're likely to be served some history with your napoleon.  </P> <P> Consider the tale of the two Tour d'Argents.  </P> <P> Latter-day gourmets are familiar with the Tour d'Argent, arguably France's most  famous restaurant, tracing its roots to an inn founded in the shadow of Notre  Dame in 1582. Following the trend, it adapted a carte, or menu, around 1780,  executed by a kitchen brigade of the type formerly reserved for aristocratic  homes. Serving kings and courtesans, it introduced the idea that one need not  own a country manor to become a gourmet. Viewed as undemocratic, it was  pillaged by patriots and auctioned.  </P> <P> As current owner Claude Terrail phrases it, "the ball closed" for a time. It  was eventually reopened by Napoleon's chef, and has since served kings and  commoners thousands of its famous numbered ducks. It has retained three stars  from Michelin longer than any other Parisian restaurant and, according to many,  still merits them.  </P> <P> A visit to its penthouse dining room (moved upstairs decades ago) provides a  magnificent bird's-eye perspective of Notre Dame, an experience that nearly  justifies the lofty prices. Current chef Manuel Martinez combines contemporary  and classic, under Terrail's ever-vigilant eye. A fixed-price lunch menu hovers  around $50, while dinners climb closer to $100 per person.  </P> <P>  Tour d'Argent, 15 Quai de la Tournelle, 75005. Telephone 43.54.23.31. Closed  Mondays.  </P> <P> </P> <P> The other Tour d'Argent sits at the Place de la Bastille. National Archive  documents establish its opening in 1640. Named for Henri VI's treasury tower in  the original Bastille prison, this Tour d'Argent played an active role in the  conflicts of 1789. Owned by Gilbert Gaillard, captain of the people's army, it  was a principal gathering site surrounded by barricades and later served as a  hospital. Reopened recently after a two-year renovation by third-generation  owner Jean Francois Solignac, it remains a more common ground than the other  Tour d'Argent, with which it is still waging a battle, this time in court, over  the use of its name.  </P> <P> Its terrace overlooks the curving glass front of the newly unveiled Opera  Bastille. The brasserie-style menu features simple grilled items and shellfish  platters at prices and hours (until 1:30 p.m.) to make republicans smile.  Dinner for one person is $40 or less.  </P> <P>  Tour d'Argent Bastille, 6 Place de La Bastille, 75012. Telephone 43.42.90.32.  Open daily.  </P> <P> </P> <P> While patriots stormed the Bastille by day, evenings in the Palais Royal  steamed with more carnal passions.  </P> <P> An arcaded square built in the 17th Century for Cardinal Richelieu, the gardens  by the 1760s drew Paris' demimonde to cafes, gambling houses and brothels. The  most sparkling survivor of the era is Grand Vefour, which traces its history to  Antoine Aubertot's Cafe de Chartres, a fashionable see-and-be scene of the era,  established in 1780. Now classified a national monument, the restaurant takes  its name from Jean Vefour, who bought it during the Restoration.  </P> <P> Its magnificent decor, Louis XVI-garlanded ceiling and elaborate wall frescoes  often backdropped Napoleon and Josephine as diners. Owned today by the  Tattinger (Champagne) group with Jean-Claude Lhonneur at the stove this season,  its menu is classic, meriting two Michelin stars. Prices are far from  democratic (around $100 per person), but there's an excellent fixed-price lunch  menu at $45.  </P> <P>  Grand Vefour, 17 rue de Beaujolais, Paris 75001. Telephone 42.96.56.27. Closed  Saturday lunch and Sunday.  </P> <P> Far from the Bastille and Palais Royal was a seamy little inn called the  Auberge du Dauphin. Set on a dirt road leading west out of Paris, it became a  carriage stop on the journey from the Tuileries to the Bois de Boulogne. If the  Auberge lacked refinement, the location held great potential, and Michel Doyen  rented it for 1,200 a year in 1791. The miserable road became the Champs  Elysees; the Inn, the elegant Ledoyen. Surviving the centuries, its own  fortunes rising and falling with subsequent republics, Ledoyen rose phoenixlike  last fall when its lease was taken by Regine, Paris' nightclub queen.  Extensively remodeled, its kitchens have been taken in hand by three-star chef  Jacques Maximin (formerly of Hotel Negresco, Nice).  </P> <P> Currently, the place is savoring its reputation as one of Paris' most expensive  and controversial restaurants, while flaunting its revival across the avenue at  another restaurant, Laurent, which traces its beginning to the same period.  Consultant Maxim recently passed the relay baton, so to speak, to chef Philippe  Dorange, but a Provencal flavor remains. Dinner in the subdued salon of Le  Guepard can easily pass the $100 per person level, inspiring loyalty among  some, derision among others.  </P> <P>  Ledoyen, Carre des Champs-Elysees, 75008 Paris. Telephone 47.42.23.23.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Down a Palais Royal passageway on the Rue du Beaujolais existed another  restaurant directly linked to the revolution. Antoine Beauvilliers, the Count  of Provence's officer de bouche (chef), unemployed after his employer's  emigration, decided to open a restaurant in 1790.  </P> <P> The restaurant, offering 168 menu choices, was an immediate success. While  other restaurants rose little above simple tavern status, Beauvilliers added  touches to warm the hearts of contemporary designers -- a dining room of  tasseled silk, liveried waiters, a well-stocked wine cellar and refined  cuisine.  </P> <P> Arrested during the Terror, Beauvilliers survived, and for 15 years was Paris'  most touted and trend-setting restaurateur. As Briffault wrote in 1846,  "Quickly raising the reputation of restaurateurs, he did for our cuisine what  the 17th and 18th centuries did for our literature."  </P> <P> Though Beauvilliers no longer exists on its original site, those in search of  the restaurant's spirit will do well to take a little license (and considerable  cash) and climb up to Montmartre, where a restaurant conceived in his honor  numbers among Paris' most celebrated.  </P> <P>  Beauvilliers, 52, rue Lamarck, Paris 75018. Telephone 42.54.54.42. Closed  Sunday and Monday lunch.  </P> <P> </P> <P> When the revolution broke out, partisans chose their camps or, more likely,  their cafes. Royalists gathered at the Cafe Valois, while citizens frequented  the Cafe des Aveugles. From the Cafe de Foy, Camille Desmoulins incited the  crowds on the 13th of July, 1789, and Danton could frequently be found at the  Cafe Parnasse, partly because the owner was his father-in-law.  </P> <P> While these have disappeared, there are others which carry on in much the same  revolutionary spirit.  </P> <P> Billing itself as the world's oldest cafe, and founded in 1686, Le Procope  quickly became the fief of politicos and journalists. Playwrights and  performers from the nearby Comedie Francaise were habitues, and by the turn of  the century Procope was one of the most celebrated of Paris' cafes. During the  revolution, it was the meeting place of Marat, Danton and Robespierre. It's  from there that the order to invade the Tuileries came.  </P> <P> Surviving as an undistinguished bistro since then, it underwent radical change  recently when purchased by an ambitious Parisian restaurant group. Salons  refurbished in 18th-Century bourgeois style now set the stage for waiters in  Napoleonic waistcoats and a menu of "reign of terror" selections: Dr. Guillotin  fish soup.  </P> <P> The best formula here, perhaps: Have a cup of coffee, read the newspapers and  contemplate the Rights of Man.  </P> <P>  Le Procope, 13 rue de 1'Ancienne -- Comedie, 75006. Telephone 43.26.99.20.  Open daily.  </P> <P> </P></p>

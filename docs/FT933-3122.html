			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Domestic &amp; General rises to Pounds 7.7m DOMESTIC &amp; General, the domestic appliance breakdown insurer,reported pre-tax profits up from Pounds 6.2m to Pounds 7.7m for the year to June 30. Mr Martin Copley, the chairman, said he was 'delighted with the progress' made by D&amp;G, which has a share of about 12 per cent of the Pounds 350m a year appliance breakdown market. Earnings per share were up 24 per cent to 75.63p and the dividend increased by 25 per cent to 22.5p. Turnover grew by 27.3 per cent to Pounds 56.29m (Pounds 44.23m), while underlying premium income, net of reinsurance, rose by 29.9 per cent to Pounds 50.03m. Total contribution (underwriting profits before expenses) amounted to Pounds 13.57m (Pounds 11.23m) and investment income Pounds 6.14m (Pounds 5.86m). Expenses were Pounds 11.46m (Pounds 10.45m). Interest payable amounted to Pounds 282m (Pounds 380m) and the group contributed Pounds 277m (Pounds 68m) to the Policyholders' Protection Board. Mr Copley said that less than 30 per cent of domestic appliances are insured and that D&amp;G is seeking to increase penetration of the market by persuading customers to insure other appliances. D&amp;G launched a 'multi-appliance policy' in June and aims to step up its efforts to expand in Europe, especially France and Germany. #</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, May 10, IRNA -- Majles Vice-Speaker Hojjat  ol-Eslam Hasan Rowhani said on Tuesday that inking any peace  accord without the consent of the Palestinian people was a "big  insult" to that nation.    "A real peace can be established only through Israel's  unconditional compliance with U.N. resolutions, return of  Palestinian refugees to their homeland and holding of a  referendum," Rowhani told Canadian Ambassador to Iran Donald  McLennan.    Rowhani, who is the secretary of the Supreme National  Security Council (SNSC) reiterated that Palestine was not  confined to a single person and that it was the Palestinian  nation that should give final approval to such an important  issue as peace.    "We have time and again expressed our views on the  Palestinian issue...we have never decided, nor will we ever  decide, to take a military action in the region," he said.    The Iranian parliamentarian maintained that it is only the  Palestinian people, and no one else, who can make decision on  the fate of Palestine. "What has been signed by (Palestine  Liberation Organization Chairman Yasir) 'Arafat is an insult to  the Palestinian people," he said. He felt confident that the  Palestinian people will one day seize power as the majority  black people of South Africa did.    The Majles vice speaker also criticized the United Nations  for its failure to fulfil its duties in Bosnia-Herzegovina in  defiance of its charter.    He said that in view of the sensitivity of the Persian Gulf  region as a key energy supply center, Iran's strong presence in  the region has always guaranteed security of the region and will  continue to do so in the future.    Pointing to the importance of parliamentary relations  between  Iran and Canada, Rowhani called for exchange of delegations  between the parliaments two countries.</p>

			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Isosceles For Isosceles, life does not get any easier. In the company's own words, trading conditions are tough - a view confirmed by other food retailers - and at the moment there seems little prospect of an improvement. Judging by the company's delayed annual report, that leaves the proud owner of the Gateway name with a problem. Even accepting the company's own valuations of its sites - it is not clear what they would be worth to a non-food retailer  -Isosceles has around Pounds 1.2bn of net debt and negative net worth of Pounds 320m. Hardly the ideal foundations for returning to the stock market in 1995. It is difficult to see that goal being achieved. With Pounds 100m a year being spent on converting stores to new formats, the company is not generating any free cash flow to reduce borrowings. Even if the Northern Ireland retailer Wellworth and the American Herman's chain can be sold, they are unlikely to fetch much more than book value. At the very minimum that implies that existing shareholders will be diluted out of existence on flotation. The banks seem to have decided that as the problem is not actually getting any worse, they will put off difficult decisions in the hope that something turns up. Refashioning Isosceles into several formats ironically apes the intentions of the financial wizards who hoped to break up the disparate group and sell it to other supermarket chains eager for space. That never happened, but the accounts show a payment for loss of office of Pounds 1.9m as a monument to the late 1980s buy-out.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> DOT has made an effort to address this uncertainty by offering to construct the mitigation at Benson's before the highway can proceed. This would allow the success or failure at Benson's to be evaluated with greater certainty. EPA believes that demonstrating success at the Benson's site or other selected sites prior to highway construction makes sense and should be part of any mitigation plan should the NHCH be partially or fully constructed. However, even if successful, it would not alter the insufficiency of the current mitigation plan. The creation site borders 3 roads, including the busy Route 111. The potential for human alteration and disturbance, from off road vehicles and other human intrusion, would remain, as well as the impacts to wildlife from fragmentation and being hit by cars and trucks. Thus, restoring the site would only offset a modest amount of the impacts the highway would cause to uncommon species in the study area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, the proposed mitigation would not replace many lost functions and values. It would not compensate for fragmenting one of the last large undeveloped tracts remaining in the study area, which provides an oasis for many species of wildlife. The plan would not replace riparian streams, floodplains or the spectrum of natural resource values these areas provide. Also, it would do little to offset the large indirect, secondary, and cumulative impacts the highway would inevitably cause or contribute to.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While preservation cannot replace the direct and indirect impacts from fragmentation, it can reduce the likely secondary and cumulative impacts. However, the current preservation proposal appears insufficient to provide substantial environmental benefits. The 100 acres at Benson's, while useful to buffer the creation area, would be located between the new highway and the developed portions of Hudson, providing only modest wildlife access and benefits. The 135 acres, which is part of the old right-of-way, protects some useful habitat; however, it is a long linear parcel and some of it lies inside of or adjacent to the NHCH.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Three areas appear to be especially valuable and vulnerable to secondary impacts in the future: (1) the 5,000&hyph;10,000 acre block in the southeastern portion of the study area; (2) a large wetland and upland complex in the southern part of Litchfield and Londonderry, containing several rare species and bordering other protected lands; and (3) floodplain forest and farmland along the Merrimack River in Litchfield. We request comment on the adequacy of the current preservation package and whether additional preservation options, such as portions of those described above, could offset the likely secondary and cumulative impacts of the highway.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After considering the project's impacts and the uneven track record of wetland creation and enhancement projects to compensate for projects involving much less severe impacts, EPA has concluded that the adverse effects of the highway will be difficult to mitigate sufficiently to render them environmentally acceptable. The mitigation plan described in the EIS and other documents would not compensate for the severe impacts to wildlife which the project would cause.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. Proposed Determination  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based on the current proposal, the Regional Administrator proposes to recommend that the discharge of dredged or fill material into wetlands and other waters associated with the Nashua-Hudson Circumferential Highway be prohibited. This action would not prohibit other uses of the land on the alignment, nor would it preclude possible permitting of partial build alternatives.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposed determination is based primarily on the adverse impacts to wildlife. EPA has already concluded and stated in previous letters that the project would cause or contribute to significant degradation of waters of the United States and violate the &sect;404(b)(1) Guidelines. It would directly destroy 40 acres of wetlands in an area beset with cumulative impacts, and will degrade additional wetlands through secondary and indirect impacts. Based on current information, the Regional Administrator has reason to believe that the adverse impacts of the Nashua-Hudson Circumferential Highway would be unacceptable. Moreover, these impacts may be in part avoidable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VI. Solicitation of Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA solicits comments on all issues discussed in this notice. In particular, we request information on the likely adverse impacts to wildlife and other functional values of the streams and wetlands at the site. We also seek information pertaining to plants, animals and hydrology of the site and adjacent lands. All studies of the natural resource values of the area or informal observations would be helpful. Information on species or communities of regional and/or statewide importance would be especially useful.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While the significant loss of wildlife habitat serves as EPA's main basis for this proposed 404(c) determination, New England has additional concerns with the proposed project including water quality and drinking water impacts, alternatives, and mitigation. In particular, EPA solicits comments on particular aspects of the project including:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The presence and likely impacts to fish and wildlife resources using the study area;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The potential for indirect impacts from the NHCH to fish and wildlife resources, such as fragmentation, noise and roadkill;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The extent to which local roads and other disturbances have or have not fragmented the study area;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The extent to which the bridges and culverts would or would not provide for the movement of animals;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) The potential for secondary wetland losses, through additional development that would benefit from access to the highway;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Evidence of past and likely future cumulative impacts to the aquatic environment;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) Information on potential for drinking water and other water quality impacts;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8) Information on whether the new highway would generate additional traffic and land use changes compared to a no-build alternative;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (9) The extent to which additional traffic would travel across the Taylor's Falls Bridge and the Tyngsborough Bridge to avoid paying tolls on the Sagamore Bridge or the northern bridge.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (10) The extent to which partial build options would provide traffic relief or make the traffic situation worse, including adding more traffic on local roads, such as Route 3A;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (11) The effectiveness or lack of effectiveness of the NHCH in reducing traffic congestion;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Alejandro Benitez] </F>   [Text] Enrique Dajer Nahum, president of the Confederation  of National Chambers of Commerce (Concanaco), has said the  country's economic structure is well established because there  are steady and solid foundations to continue to develop,  however, "political excuses" have generated too much "agitation."    As the Concanaco president attended the meeting in which  Jose  Francisco Ruiz Massieu, Institute of the National Housing Fund  for Workers director general, submitted a report on its  activities, he added we will be able to remain calm insofar as  we know how to preserve the balance and analyze significant  issues. Dajer pointed out: The political aspect undoubtedly  takes a toll of the investors' minds, but we also know that  economic reasons will eventually prevail, as we saw on 22 and 23  April when the respite returned. We are positive this trend  will prevail, he added.    To that effect, the Concanaco leader emphasized his proposal  to restructure interest rate effects with a new plan to ensure  that they will not have a major impact on productive  enterprises. He also said it is necessary to solve, once and  for all, expired portfolios to ensure that both enterprises and  banks will no longer have constant friction between them and  that economic development will reemerge. Dajer stressed that  relations between Concanaco and the bankers are good and  believes in solving the country's economic ups and downs.    As he was interviewed at the Concanaco headquarters, the  processing industrialists' leader said the political debate, to  which Ernesto Zedillo Ponce De Leon, presidential candidate for  the Institutional Revolutionary Party and his opponents from the  National Action Party and the Party of the Democratic Revolution  were invited, "will not eliminate anguish, uncertainty, or  fears, which we must not link to the economic arena because they  spark negative effects. The political debate is simply the  analysis of political platforms to ensure that we, the citizens,  will be able to analyze them more objectively."    Victor Manuel Terrones Lopez, president of Canacintra  [National Association of the Processing Industry], said  businessmen, as citizens, "favor this political change because  thanks to the debate, we will establish which presidential  candidate offers a better alternative to solve our country's  political and socioeconomic issues."    As he talked about the meetings the business leadership held  with President Carlos Salinas at the Los Pinos presidential  residence on several occasions, Terrones said the following: The  objective of the meetings was to analyze socioeconomic and  political development. The president expressed the need that we  offer him special support, but we have already supported him and  his economic policies. Salinas also wants some adjustments to  adapt the economic policies to the current times and  circumstances.    As for last week's recovery of the Mexican Stock Exchange  [BMV], Terrones said the recovery was only logical because "we  must take into account that the BMV is a volatile stock  exchange. Mexico does not face this problem alone, however; it  occurs in all of the world's stock exchanges. This is why the  ups and downs are normal, but they fail to indicate whether  there will be a resounding bear market."    He said that due to the maturity already reached by the  Mexican private sector, "financial agitation is already leaving  us because the changes are not as radical as those we previously  experienced. For instance, the case of the BMV is currently  handled more professionally because virtually all of the stock  exchanges thank the funds from which they receive greater  financial backing than if it were done by individuals."    As Terrones talked about economic recovery, he maintained  that it will take place in May, but "it will not be a widespread  recovery" because some sectors are indeed producing more, but  others will not recover until late 1994. He acknowledged that  recession or stagnation prevail in two-thirds of the production  sector because even though recovery indexes were encouraging in  January and February, the recovery "fell in March." Industries  and demand, however, will begin to recover slowly at the  beginning of the second half of this year.    Finally, the Canacintra president added that the sectors  with  greater growth capacity are those sectors that have greater  export capacity because production recovery will not be  widespread. "Achieving growth will take us several months, but  it will be more consistent by late 1994," Terrones concluded.</p>

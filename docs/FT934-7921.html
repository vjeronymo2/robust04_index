			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Bolger to form a government but says 'I got the message': PM's party scrapes home by one seat after New Zealand's voters show their weariness with reforms NEW Zealand's conservative National party yesterday secured the majority - albeit a 'wafer-thin' one - that it needs to form a government and prime minister Jim Bolger said he could govern for a full three-year term. But he indicated that his government would slow down its reform programme, saying the electorate had given the party a 'pretty clear message about what it thought of them'. The counting of special votes from absentee electors gave the National party the one extra seat it needed for an overall majority, ending the political stalemate created 11 days ago when a general election delivered a hung parliament. The vote count lifted National to 50 seats from 49 on election night in the 99-seat parliament, with the Labour opposition dropping to 45 from 46 and the two minor parties steady on four seats. Mr Bolger said he was delighted the stalemate was over but understood the message voters sent his government when they cut its majority from 34 seats. In an interview, he said he had repeatedly pointed out during the election campaign that the government had completed most of its reform plans during the past three years. Mr Bolger indicated that, because of his party's small majority, he would try to involve the opposition in some sort of consensus on policy, although he said it would not be possible to 'run around' and consult them on every issue. 'There will be some topics such as employment that we'll want to discuss with them,' he said. Financial markets echoed Mr Bolger's delight with the result. The New Zealand dollar rose a full cent to USDollars 0.5500 and the share market ended almost 5 per cent up on the day. Last week both local and international investors reacted badly to the hung parliament and the voters' decision to change to a proportional representation electoral system. The huge inroads into National's majority and support for the left-leaning Alliance and populist New Zealand First parties were seen as a rebuff to free-market policies that both National and Labour governments have pursued since 1984. The slender majority is expected to make for parliamentary difficulties for Mr Bolger as opposition parties are expected to demand that National provides a Speaker, who does not normally vote. This would leave National with 49 voting MPs, the same as the opposition parties. Under recent changes the Speaker can vote with the government on minor matters but cannot support issues that he believes parliament as a whole would not approve. The leader of the Alliance, Mr Jim Anderton, said last night his party, which won two seats, would honour its promise to support the government on motions of confidence. Labour leader Mr Mike Moore congratulated National on its win but said his party would keep up pressure to moderate National party legislation on such things as trade union legislation. Mr Bolger last night refused to say whether the finance minister Ruth Richardson would continue in the post in the new government. Both the Alliance and Labour have criticised her 'New Right' views, and hinted that they would have difficulty working with her in the new 'consensus' politics. Ms Richardson says she wants to stay and Mr Bolger will have to take into account her popularity in the financial markets. Mr Bolger yesterday reversed his earlier decision not to attend the meeting of Pacific Rim leaders at this week's Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation conference in Seattle. He said he would fly to the conference today and return next Tuesday to form his administration. He said he would not call parliament until immediately before Christmas. One of the biggest problems for the government over the next three years will be potential rebellions by its own members, three of whom are known to disagree strongly with a number of its policies. Yesterday, in a hint of what may be to come, one of National's most outspoken MPs, Michael Laws, threatened to resign if the government allowed an apple exporting company, Applefields, to break the Apple and Pear Board's monopoly on selling fruit overseas. In what appeared to be a turnaround, the minister of agriculture John Falloon said that a break in the monopoly would be against the interests of apple exporters.</p>

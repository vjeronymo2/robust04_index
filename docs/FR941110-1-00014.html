The proposed rules establish procedures for the Commissioner to issue an interim extension of the term of a patent where the original term would expire before a product covered by the patent has received regulatory approval for commercial marketing or use. The rules also are proposed to be amended to clarify that an application for patent term extension must be based on regulatory activities performed by the patent owner or its agent. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Written comments must be submitted on or before January 12, 1995.

Prior to enactment of Public Law 103&hyph;179, eligibility for patent term extension was dependent on regulatory approval of the product before the original patent term expired. Public Law 103&hyph;179 has made it possible, under appropriate circumstances, to obtain interim extensions of patent term where the regulatory process is likely to extend beyond the expiration of the patent term. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One purpose of the proposed rule change is to revise the present regulations contained in 37 CFR Part 1, Subpart F, to include provisions for interim extension of the patent term prior to regulatory approval of the product that can now form the basis of patent term extension. These proposed rules set forth procedures that govern the content and submission of applications for an interim extension of a patent term, and procedures governing the interim extension determination and issuance of interim patent term extension certificates by the Office. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Initial guidelines directed to the preparation and filing of applications for interim extensions of patent terms as authorized by Public Law 103&hyph;179 were published as ``Guidelines For Interim Extension Under 35 U.S.C. 156(d)(5) of a Patent Term Prior To Regulatory Approval of a Product For Commercial Marketing or Use_Public Law 103&hyph;179 (December 3, 1993)'' in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Official Gazette <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  at 1159 Off. Gaz. Pat. Office 12 (February 1, 1994). It is intended that those guidelines will continue in effect until the promulgation of final rules based on the proposed rulemaking. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is important to keep in mind the distinction between an interim patent term extension under &sect;156(e)(2) and the interim patent term extension provided for by Public Law 103&hyph;179 under &sect;156(d)(5). The former applies after regulatory approval has occurred and is addressed in 37 CFR 1.706. Interim patent term extensions under &sect;156(e)(2) are not affected by the proposed changes to the rules. The latter applies before regulatory approval has occurred and is addressed in 37 CFR 1.780 and 1.790. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The eligibility criteria for obtaining an interim extension under &sect;156(d)(5) are substantially the same as for obtaining patent term extension under &sect;156 after regulatory approval has occurred. Under the provisions of Public Law 103&hyph;179, a patent owner or its agent may submit an application for an interim patent term extension within six months, but not later than 15 days, of the original expiration date of the patent. At the time the application is submitted, the regulatory review period must have advanced to the approval phase a defined in &sect;156(g), but must not have ended. For a new drug, for example, the approval phase is defined in &sect;156(g)(1)(B)(ii) as the period beginning on the date a new drug application was initially submitted for the new drug under section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The content of the application for interim extension is proposed to be the same as for an application for patent term extension following regulatory review, with certain modifications necessitated by the circumstances. For example, the application for interim term extension will not be required to contain information about regulatory approval since that event has not occurred. A fee is proposed for each interim extension application filed before regulatory approval occurs_$400.00 for the initial application for interim extension and $200.00 for each supplementary application for interim extension. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

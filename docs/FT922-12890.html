			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / International Company News: Nikkei decline triggers warning on Japan banks A JAPANESE banking industry leader yesterday expressed concern that the country's hard-pressed banks would face difficulties meeting international standards for capital adequacy. The recent plunge in the Tokyo stock market would make it difficult for Japanese banks to meet rules set down by the Bank for International Settlements, said Mr Kenichi Suematsu, chairman of the Federation of Bankers' Associations of Japan. Mr Suematsu's comments, although cautiously framed, were a blunt assessment of Japanese banks' prospects of meeting standards that will come into effect in March 1993. Under BIS rules, Japanese banks are allowed to count as capital a portion of unrealised gains on stock portfolios. However, the fall in equities has wiped away much of these profits. The Nikkei index of leading shares closed yesterday at 17,439.58, up 202.93 points, but down more than 50 per cent from its peak. Mr Suematsu, who is also president of Sakura Bank, said that banks would be likely to meet the BIS standard of an 8 per cent capital-to-assets ratio - as long as the Nikkei rebounded to 20,000. However, banks could not reach a ratio of 8.5 per cent - allowing a margin of safety - unless the Nikkei recovered to 23,000. Asked whether banks would cut loans to meet BIS standards, Mr Suematsu said it was more natural for banks to try to increase capital and to attempt to cut assets other than loans - for example, currency-dealing operations. He added that the current weak demand for loans in Japan was helping banks reach their desired ratios. Mr Suematsu's remarks beg the question of what might happen if banks fail to meet BIS ratios. The international agreement covering capital adequacy carries no sanctions and is not binding on the countries that signed it, let alone on individual banks. It is left to the regulatory authorities in each country to decide what to do with banks that fail to meet the standards. In Japan, this means the Ministry of Finance. Given the complexity of the rules determining how to account for assets and capital, the ministry has some flexibility. However, it could not bend regulations blatantly since this could arouse complaints from other countries. It would also undermine confidence in the banks - and so be counter-productive. However, as IBCA, a London-based rating agency, says in a report it would be in nobody's interest for the Ministry of Finance to become 'rigidly doctrinaire' and demand that banks should reach BIS standards whatever the cost. To a large extent, BIS has already achieved its purpose in devising the ratios. The mere publication of the data has forced banks to be more prudent in managing their assets - well before the rules formally come into effect. US and European banks, which hoped the rules would curb the runaway international expansion of Japanese banks, have also seen their aim fulfilled, albeit more drastically than they had expected.</p>

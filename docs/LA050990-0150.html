			<p><P> May 9, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FILM STUDIOS ARE GIRDING FOR SUMMER;  </P> <P> HOLLYWOOD: THE FINISHING TOUCHES OF STRATEGY AND MARKETING ARE BEING PUT ON A  SEASON OF SEQUELS.  </P> <P> With the peak summer moviegoing months almost here, the Hollywood studios are  putting final touches on their release schedules. Like television networks  gearing for ratings sweeps, the studios have spent much of the spring engaged  in a planning war of marketing and counterprogramming that they hope will  produce blockbuster ticket sales this summer.  </P> <P> Studios have changed the announced released dates on about half a dozen major  summer movies. In some cases, the schedule changes are expected to result in  fierce contests between two or more potential hits while, in other cases, the  date swapping promises to give a film a relatively wide-open berth.  </P> <P> As ever, the studios are also counting on sequel appeal as a selling factor.  The summer slate includes eight titles with a sense of deja vu, up from last  summer's seven.  </P> <P> Along with "RoboCop II," "Another 48 HRS.," "Die Hard 2" and "Gremlins II,"  there'll be "Exorcist III: Legion," "Young Guns II," "The Two Jakes" and "Back  to the Future III."  </P> <P> Most studio executives are quick to note that, even at this late date,  everything on the summer slate is subject to change. Some films, such as 20th  Century Fox's "Die Hard 2" are not finished yet and may not make their  scheduled release dates. Still, other films may be moved in order to take  advantage of a perceived weakness in the competition or to capitalize on other  market changes.  </P> <P> Here's the latest rundown:  </P> <P> * May 18: Orion Pictures' "Cadillac Man," starring Robin Williams, will trying  to pick off Universal Pictures' "Bird on a Wire," starring Goldie Hawn and Mel  Gibson.  </P> <P> * May 25: Universal's "Back to the Future III" looks like it may have the  Memorial Day weekend all to itself. Ironically, the holiday weekend used to  mark the kick-off of the summer movie season but no more.  </P> <P> * June 1: Tri-Star's futuristic saga "Total Recall," starring Arnold  Schwarzenegger, was initially scheduled to shoot it out with "Dick Tracy,"  directed by and starring Warren Beatty on June 15. Then Tri-Star decided to  move "Total Recall" to June 1, when there is no major opposition. The reason?  "Those two movies were clearly competing for the same audience," says a studio  marketing executive from another studio, adding, "Now, Tri-Star has a clear  shot."  </P> <P> * June 8: When production went longer than planned on Paramount's "Days of  Thunder," a racing drama starring Tom Cruise, the studio switched its opening  with the planned June 27 release of "Another 48 HRS.," which reteams Nick Nolte  and Eddie Murphy in a sequel to their hit 1982 action-comedy. So the sequel  looks like it may have this weekend to itself.  </P> <P> * June 15: With "Total Recall" out of the June 15 slot, "Dick Tracy" briefly  appeared to have a clear shot -- until Warner decided to push back the opening  date of its "Gremlins II: The New Batch" from May 18.  </P> <P> "It's counterprogramming," declares a marketing spokeswoman who asked that her  name not be used. The strategy? "The talk around town is that 'Dick Tracy' and  (director/star) Warren Beatty don't have kid appeal. But kids definitely know  the 'Gremlins.' "  </P> <P> Last summer, it was Disney that counted on "kid appeal" as a counterprogramming  element against Warner -- by changing the release date of "Honey, I Shrunk the  Kids" so that it opened the same week as Warner's dark drama "Batman." While  the latter went on to rewrite the record books, with grosses of $251 million,  "Honey" emerged a surprise hit -- and proof of the burgeoning market for family  movies -- with grosses of $130 million.  </P> <P> * June 22: There's a scheduled battle between Orion's "RoboCop II," starring  Peter Weller, and 20th Century Fox's "Die Hard 2," starring Bruce Willis. But  if "Die Hard 2" doesn't wrap production in time, it is likely to wind up racing  Paramount's "Days of Thunder" on June 27.  </P> <P> * June 27: "Days of Thunder."  </P> <P> * July 13: "Exorcist III: Legion."  </P> <P> * Late July: "Young Guns II."  </P> <P> * Aug. 10: "The Two Jakes."  </P></p>

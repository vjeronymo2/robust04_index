			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / Recovery eludes German chemicals West German chemicals manufacturers' profits fell sharply for the fourth successive year in 1993, and there is no sign of a lasting recovery, according to Mr Gert Becker, president of the VCI industry association. The world marketplace had undergone a fundamental change, and it was no longer possible to make certain products competitively in Germany, he said in a new year review. Aggregate earnings tumbled 30 per cent in 1993, following a similar slump the previous year and falls of 20 and 25 per cent in 1991 and 1990 respectively. Prices in Germany for raw materials, labour, energy, environmental protection, taxes and social welfare were far higher than in many other countries. But industry's influence over these cost factors was severely limited, said Mr Becker, who is also chairman of Degussa. The indigenous industry could succeed only if it was able to bring innovations to market. That depended on government willingness to reduce bureaucracy and legal hindrances to investment, and popular acceptance of the need for scientific and technical progress. Government health reforms led to a 4 per cent drop in drugs production last year, Mr Becker claimed, compared with an overall 3 per cent decline in the industry's volume output. Deliveries of chemical fibres fell 12 per cent; producer prices were down 2.6 per cent; and industry-wide turnover from these products slipped 5.5 per cent to DM155bn (Pounds 60.5bn). Production of basic inorganic chemicals fell 5 per cent while organic chemicals prices were 6 per cent lower than the previous year. The industry shed almost 5 per cent of its workforce, cutting 29,000 jobs, said Mr Becker, adding that labour cuts would continue this year. Investment dropped to DM9.5bn from DM11.3bn in 1992, while spending on research and development was maintained at DM10.6bn.</p>

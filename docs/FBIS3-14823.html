"The Russian procurator general sent a letter to the State  Duma on Saturday morning to specify circumstances preventing the  procurator's office from the implementation of the Duma  resolution on political amnesty. Two Duma committees started to  prepare a response to the procurator's inquiry believing that  the procurator general's office waits for the answer," they said.    Meanwhile the committees did their work, the procurator  general's office implemented the resolution to free culprits of  the October 1993 bloodshed, which runs counter to the law,  judging by Kazannik's letter.    The resolution on liberation of the accused was signed by  Deputy Procurator General Kartsev "on silent consent of the  procurator general, stressed presidential assistant on national  security and doctor of juridical sciences Baturin. As a result,  the procurator general's office created a precedent of illegal  implementation of decisions, he said.    In his turn, Satarov said the procurator general's office  adopted a resolution to free the Lefortovo inmates while the  Duma tried to remove contradictions in its resolution on  political amnesty.</p>

			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of India (45): Entertainment at the push of a button  -Satellite TV has taken the nation by storm / India is at the heart of the 1.2bn strong Asian television audience now being targeted by international media barons such as Rupert Murdoch and Ted Turner INDIA has finally become part of the great TV global village. Gone are the days when the unimaginative and politically-motivated bureaucrats who presided over Doordarshan, the government-controlled national network, decided what was best for India's 335m television watchers. Today, viewers can choose from five Star TV channels (BBC world service, Prime Sports, MTV music channel, Star Plus entertainment channel, Zee TV, a Hindi language channel) as well as CNN, Dubai Television, Pakistan Television, two channels from ATN (Asia Television Network), five channels from Doordarshan state television and the Asianet Indian regional language channel in Malayalam. That's not all. International television companies, like soft drinks and cigarette companies, are targeting newer markets, as their domestic markets level out. Asia, with its 1.2bn viewers and a wave of government deregulation and technology, affords the greenest pastures. Media barons such as Rupert Murdoch and Ted Turner have staked their claim. Two months ago, Murdoch paid Dollars 525m for a 63.6 per cent stake in Hutchvision, the Hong Kong-based company which owns Star TV. A formidable new consortium comprising Time Warner's HBO Asia, Turner Broadcasting corporation (which owns CNN), ESPN International, the world's largest producer of sports programmes, Viacom, owners of MTV, Australia's entertainment channel, AUSTV, and Hong Kong's TVB, with a large bank of Chinese programmes, is all set to make a foray into the Asian market. The Pearson group, which owns the Financial Times, is also exploring the Asian, and Indian market. All the new entrants, including Murdoch's newly-acquired Star (which recently signed up a marketing joint venture in India with Bombay-based MediaScope and the Deccan Chronicle newspaper group), seem to opt for some kind of overseas partnering, which makes local political and social obstacles easier to surmount. If Asia is television's newest frontier then India is at its core. Star's phenomenal success has been bolstered by the fact that India has the largest English-speaking population outside Europe and America, and a rising middle class that is only too happy to add more channels to its widening television horizon. Star, dismissed by the Indian government two years ago as a luxury channel that some of the country's elite would watch, today has a fast-growing audience of 18.8m, a 150 per cent increase since June 1992. The Star Plus soaps, Santa Barbara and The Bold and the Beautiful, are discussed endlessly in drawing rooms across the country; the hourly BBC news has all but replaced Doordarshan's lacklustre coverage of events; and a whole new genre of Asian rock and pop stars have found their voices on Star's Asian version of MTV. Star, which is distributed through local cable television operators with no previous experience in the trade, had little competition until six months ago, but is now the most powerful satellite distribution system in the region. There are also other contenders, some of them from inside the region. 'When viewers have a surfeit of programming to choose from, they are increasingly going to look for programmes that they can relate to, in languages that are their own,' says Mr Sashi Kumar, president of Asianet, a Madras-based TV company. Mr Kumar had previously bought time on a Russian satellite to beam programmes in the Malayalam language to the people of Kerala, on India's southern-most tip, and to Malayalam-speaking communities in the Gulf countries. He says: 'the new trend in television is going to be narrow-casting.' By that he means identifying an audience and giving it the programmes it wants in the language it understand best. Asianet, besides generating its own software, has embarked upon an ambitious Rs1.4bn programme to make cable accessible to the entire state of Kerala. Not content with leaving the distribution of its channel to private operators, the company has signed an agreement with Pan Asian Systems, a subsidiary of the Hong Kong-based Hutchison Whampoa, to lay coaxial cables along the state's electricity lines, with franchisees to service the channel. The cables, fed by dish farms or a conglomeration of satellite dishes (15 or 20 of these 'farms' cover the whole state) have a capacity to carry up to 50 channels, and are currently offering subscribers the five Star channels, besides Asianet's Malayalam language channel and the Doordarshan channels. Other channels in different South Indian languages will be added. International TV companies will also have to reconcile internationalism with localism if they are to win foreign markets. The government, in a belated attempt at salvaging its viewership, is planning a series of 21 channels (through digital compression technology) by the end of January, and 10 regional channels in the next month. The rush for the Indian airwaves is still on, but in the next few years, audiences will ensure that only the best survive.</p>

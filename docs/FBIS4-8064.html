			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Is Gorazde going to be another Bhopal? After 13  days of fighting [words indistinct] the defenders from the area  of Vitkovici decided to plant explosives in a nitrogen factory.  We have just learned from Mirsad Dragolj that explosives were  planted in two tanks containing 25 metric tons of ammonia each  and a tank with 20 tons of formalin.    If these tanks explode, the consequences would certainly be  vast, not only for the area of Vitkovici and Gorazde, but also  for the whole of the northern part of the Drina valley. Mr.  Dragolj said this was not an act of desperation, but a move  caused by futile actions of the representatives of the  peacekeeping forces. It is a consequence of the lies about the  latest offensive by some key people in the world organization  and also of the reactions by our state and military organs,  which came too late.

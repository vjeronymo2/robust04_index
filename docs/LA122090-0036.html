			<p><P> December 20, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> FASHION;  </P> <P> BELT-TIGHTENING;  </P> <P> THE IDEA OF BUYING THE LATEST CLOTHING FAD SO YOUNGSTERS CAN DON NEW APPAREL  QUICKLY WEARS THIN FOR PARENTS.  </P> <P> My sisters and I used to call it the holiday harangue. With only slight  variations over the years, it went something like this:  </P> <P> "But Mom, everyone is wearing them."  </P> <P> "I don't care if every kid on the planet wears them."  </P> <P> "But Mom, it's for Christmas."  </P> <P> Long pause. "Well, we'll see."  </P> <P> Whether or not our requested clothing item showed up under the tree usually  depended on three factors: Was it outrageously expensive? Was it practical? Did  it have any redeeming aesthetic value?  </P> <P> My own kids are still young enough that they only want toys. And mercifully,  they're still gullible enough to believe that any omission from their Christmas  list is due to Santa's fiscal problems.  </P> <P> But I wondered what kind of clothing items other kids across the county were  asking for this year -- and whether Santa was going to come through.  </P> <P> My niece, a ninth-grader at Sinaloa Junior High in Simi Valley, told me she  wasn't exactly expecting a Christmas miracle. Just a pair of "black, clunky  boots" from England and maybe some designer jeans.  </P> <P> And what did Santa think of the requests? "Those boots have got to be the  ugliest things I've ever seen," her mother said. "There's no way I'm going to  spend $90 on something even Frankenstein wouldn't wear."  </P> <P> The jeans have a similarly slim chance of making it into a wrapped box. "I'm  sorry, but I won't spend money on ripped jeans. I have a dog that can do that  for free."  </P> <P> Cori Smith, co-manager of Contempo Casuals in Simi Valley, is a seasoned  veteran of the holiday harangue. Mothers and daughters often come into the  store to shop for Christmas clothing. Their differing opinions, she said,  frequently provide entertainment for the staff.  </P> <P> "We have some tops that, for all intents and purposes, are sheer, and when the  mothers see that they look like negligees, they refuse to buy them," Smith  said. "But they usually cave in at the end. Their kids plead with them so  much."  </P> <P> Several store owners said that clothing items that encounter less parental  resistance include currently popular fleece jackets, jeans with leather sewn  onto them to resemble riding chaps, and oversize blazers.  </P> <P> "From the top up, the girls look really nice with these tailored jackets, and  from the waist down, it's the gym look, with mid-calf leggings and tennis  shoes, " said Karen Abel, owner of Wear It Again Sam, a resale clothing store  across the street from Ventura High School.  </P> <P> Over at the Gap in Thousand Oaks, sales associate Eddie Brown said parents are  coming in with their kids' lists and shopping for more conservative looks. "A  lot of kids have asked for overalls. Leggings and oversize shirts are still a  hot look," he said. "Still, most times if it's for a gift, the parents ask if  it's returnable."  </P> <P> And what about boys? As expected, store owners said many clothing requests are  sports-related. But even a simple T-shirt or pair of shorts -- especially if  they're made by such pricey designers as Quiksilver, Billabong, Stussy or  Jimmy'Z -- can turn some Santas into grinches.  </P> <P> "Some T-shirts with a mock turtleneck can be $29, and denim shorts can cost  $44," said Shar Caudill, assistant manager of Surfin' West in Simi Valley.  "Sometimes a parent will say, 'I'm sorry, but I just don't have that much.'  Other times they'll break down and say, 'Oh, OK, it's Christmas.' "  </P> <P> And then there is the rare teen-ager like Ventura High School senior Jessica  Berryhill, who changes the entire holiday shopping equation.  </P> <P> Berryhill, dressed on a recent afternoon in a green polyester-knit sweater from  the 1960s and carrying a small child's lunch pail as a purse, said she steers  clear of department stores. Berryhill prefers thrift stores, where she's more  likely to find the "hippie or beatnik" styles she likes.  </P> <P> How does her mother feel about buying her used clothes for Christmas?  </P> <P> Berryhill smiled. "I think she'd rather not," she said. "I think she'd prefer  that I wore clothes from places like The Broadway."  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE PREMISE  </P> <P> Ventura County is teeming with the fashionable and not so fashionable. There  are trend-makers and trend-breakers. There are those with style-personal and  off the rack-and those making fashion statements better left unsaid. Twice a  month, we'll be taking a look at fashion in Ventura County-trends, styles and  ideas-and asking you what you think. If you have a fashion problem, sighting or  suggestion; if you know a fashion success or a fashion victim, let us know. We  want to hear from you.  </P></p>

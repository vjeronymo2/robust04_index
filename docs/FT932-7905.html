			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Average earnings rise by slowest rate for 25 years AVERAGE EARNINGS grew an underlying 4 per cent in the year to March, the slowest rate of increase for 25 years and 0.5 percentage point lower than in February. The Department of Employment said the March figure was affected by advance payments of bonuses and salaries in March last year ahead of the general election and anxiety about the Labour party's plans for higher tax rates. This was especially relevant in the service sector, where average earnings slowed considerably. In the year to March underlying earnings rose by 3.75 per cent, the lowest figure since the statistical series began in 1985. It compared with 4.5 per cent in the year to February. Earnings were also driven lower by falling pay settlements, the department said. In March British footwear workers agreed a pay increase of 2.5 per cent compared with 3.75 per cent last year, while electrical contractors' employees agreed 3.1 per cent compared with 5.8 per cent a year ago. In manufacturing the underlying increase in average weekly earnings in the year to March was 4.75 per cent, compared with 5 per cent in the year to February. Average earnings have now fallen more than 6 percentage points since they peaked in July 1990 at 10.25 per cent. Unit wage costs were 2.9 per cent lower in the three months to March than they were in the same period a year ago. This was the largest fall in such costs since the series began in 1970. Officials said unit wage costs were falling faster than in any other G7 country. Manufacturing productivity, or output per head, was 2.7 per cent higher in the three months to March than it was in the three months ending December.</p>

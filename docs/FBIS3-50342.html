			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Belgrade, 27 January (TANJUG) -- In reaction to  the writings of certain papers and agencies which accuse the  Yugoslav Army [VJ] of direct involvement in the war in Bosnia,  the head of the information service of the Yugoslav Army's  general staff, Colonel Ljubomir Stojadinovic, told TANJUG today  that there were no VJ units on the territory of former  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    The high-ranking VJ officer further said: "We are not  excluding the possibility that citizens of the Federal Republic  of Yugoslavia -- former members of the VJ among them -- are  fighting on the side of the Army of the Serb Republic as  volunteers. We are certain that both the domestic and the world  public are aware of the fact that a large number of mercenaries,  fanatics, adventurers, and volunteers from the Islamic countries  are fighting against the Serbs as members of the Muslim army in  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Volunteers from the FRY, as free people, cannot be denied  the  right to decide on their own fate and fight for the survival of  their people, especially since Islamic fanaticism has acquired  planetary proportions in its struggle against the Serbs.    VJ troops and heavy weapons have not been moved towards  Bosnia or any other state. They are deployed exclusively on the  sovereign territory of the FRY, in accordance with assessments  on the creation of the most favorable conditions for the defense  of the sovereignty and peace of the FRY and its citizens. The  latest accusations against the VJ directly justify these  precautions," said the spokesman for the VJ general staff.</p>

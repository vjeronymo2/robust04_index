			<p><P> December 1, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UNIONS  </P> <P> Now that President Bush has awarded the Medal of Freedom to Solidarity union  leader Lech Walesa maybe Bush and the radical right will stop bashing unions in  this country.  </P> <P> For eight years the Reagan-Bush Administration praised the Solidarity union as  fighting for freedom and rights of the workingman, while for the same eight  years the same Administration destroyed the air controllers union, packed the  National Labor Relations Board with anti-union (anti-worker) appointees, and  made many other attacks on organized labor.  </P> <P> The blue-collar union member was the backbone of this country because he was  the middle-class. As the unions and blue-collar jobs decline so does our  standard of living and our country.  </P> <P> DAVID J. CLAY  </P> <P> Woodland Hills  </P></p>

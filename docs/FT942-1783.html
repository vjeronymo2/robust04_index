			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Organic EU farm policy proposed The Soil Association, the body that promotes organic farming in the UK, has called on the European Commission to adopt a system of farm management agreements as a way of further reforming the Common Agricultural Policy. The system would ensure that farmers stick to environmental guidelines. Mr Patrick Holden, director of the Soil Association, believes the Commission should establish a set of guidelines for farmers to follow as a minimum to qualify for income support under the CAP. This whole farm management agreement could then form the basis for other bolt-on environmental measures according to region, soil type and farmer preferences. 'Everyone agrees that the CAP is fiendishly expensive and highly unpopular. . . we also know it has wreaked havoc and untold destruction on the environment,' he said. He points to the urgent need to rationalise existing environmental schemes which 'remain underfunded, overlap considerably and urgently require rationalisation within a single policy mechanism'. The Soil Association's suggestions are contained in a policy statement titled 'Subsidies Without Set-aside', which highlights the fundamental difficulty of attracting farmers to organic methods - the problem of recovering the higher cost of production in the market place. It says: 'Since the market place offers relatively few rewards for farmers who voluntarily modify their production methods to benefit the countryside, additional policy mechanisms are needed to encourage farmers to change their ways'. In addition, sustainable agriculture, which has become the latest buzzword in Brussels is interpreted in a number of ways by different producers. 'Some of these low-input, low-output systems can mean almost anything the farmer wants them to,' says Mr Holden. He maintains that the management agreements could set out specific guidelines for cutting the use of artificial inputs which would be easier to police than some of the vaguer concepts currently in use.</p>

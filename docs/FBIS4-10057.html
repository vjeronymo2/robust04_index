			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on economic developments monitored through 5 April.    Sources at the Secretariat of Commerce and Industrial  Development (Secofi) have said the Mexican Government will  launch a "great offensive" against the importation of subsidized  agricultural products from the United States, Canada, and  European countries. Secofi sources explained a government  investigation on imported wheat, milk, and garlic will be  initiated.    Meanwhile, Secofi reported the official gazette has  published  two antidumping resolutions on importing dioctilftalate  [dioctilftalato] and sodium carbonate from Germany and the  United States, respectively. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in  Spanish 29 March 94 p 20)    The government's 1993 anti-inflation measures slowed  production, sales, and jobs, with ensuing effects in income  levels. The slow progress in economic activity resulted in a  1.2-percent reduction in the gross domestic product (GDP) for  the first time since 1987, according to a report by the  Confederation of National Chambers of Commerce (Concanaco). The  report revealed the manufacturing industry decreased by 1.5  percent last year, while the commerce, restaurant, and hotel  sectors declined by 1.2 percent. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in  Spanish 29 March 94 p 28)    The production of important raw materials by Pemex  Petrochemical, a subsidiary of Mexican Petroleum (Pemex), shrunk  by approximately 14 percent last year due to the closure of  obsolete plants and the difficult situation of internal and  external markets. Ethylene and polyethylene production declined  12 percent while ammonium and methanol fell 20 percent and 15  percent respectively. Pemex Petrochemical concluded that  concerning synthetic fibers, the importation of clothes, fabric,  and textiles has reduced internal production, thereby affecting  the demand for raw materials produced by Pemex. (Mexico City  UNOMASUNO in Spanish 29 March 94 p 18)    Foreign investments in Mexico during the first quarter of  this year increased to over $4 billion, namely, 143 percent over  the amount registered for the same period in 1993, Secofi  authorities reported on 30 March. (Mexico City XEW Television  Network in Spanish 0430 GMT 31 March 94)    The commercial representative of the Chilan Embassy in  Mexico  has reported bilateral trade between Mexico and Chile grew 38  percent during 1993, totaling $340.5 million in transactions.  The official said Mexico had a positive trade balance of $78.9  million. The Chilean diplomat explained bilateral trade was  boosted by the Economic Supplementary Agreement, which became  effective in January 1992. The official concluded Chile  exported $130.8-million worth of goods to Mexico during 1993,  while it imported more than $200 million worth of goods.  (Madrid EFE in Spanish 2349 GMT 31 March 94)    As of 31 March 33, products, including beans, corn, bread,  and wheat flour, have been deregulated. Among the deregulated  products are fuels like gasoline, diesel fuel, natural and  liquefied gas, and 20 primary petrochemicals. According to  Secofi, the prices of these products will be regulated by the  law of supply and demand. Secofi sources have concluded this  decision was made based on the fact the opening of the economy  guarantees availability of products for internal consumption.    Meanwhile in Washington, the World Bank approved a  $450-million loan to Mexico on 31 March. The loan will be used  to improve quality and efficiency of elementary school education  in 10 of the poorest states of Mexico. (Mexico City XEW  Television Network in Spanish 0430 GMT 1 April 94)    On 1 April, business sector officials reported productive  efficiency in the country rose 8.8 percent during 1993,  following 4- and 7.2-percent increases in 1991 and 1992,  respectively. The Confederation of Industrial Chambers has noted  the importance of production efficiency amid high interest rates  and a 9-percent annual inflation. A study published by the  magazine INDUSTRIA has revealed productivity in growing sectors  increased 18.4 percent on average. Among the sectors with  higher growth rates are the basic metal industries, with 30  percent; nonmetal mineral industries, with 12.7 percent; the  manufacturing industry, with 12.3 percent; lumber production,  with 7.2 percent; the chemical industry, with 6.5 percent; and  the food industry, with 4.5 percent. (Mexico City NOTIMEX in  Spanish 2141 GMT 1 April 94)    Secofi has reported that during the present six-year term,  the auto industry has invested more than $10.5 billion in Mexico  and created more than 210,000 jobs. Secofi said Chrysler, the  Ford Motor Company, and Nissan were among the companies that  invested the most. Investments totaling approximately $2.4  billion are expected this year in the auto industry. Those  investments are expected to generate 18,000 new jobs and to  result in the manufacture of more than 1 million vehicles for  the second consecutive year. (Mexico City LA JORNADA in Spanish  4 April 94 pp 48, 22)    Luis German Carcoba Garcia, president of the Business  Coordinating Council (CEE), has said population growth exceeded  economic growth for the first time in recent years. The  business leader said it would be erroneous to close the gap  between population growth and economic dynamism by using  "populist policies." According to the Secretariat of Finance and  Public Credit (SHCP), the economy grew 3.75 percent less than  the population increase in 1993. Last year the GDP grew by .4  percent, while the population grew by 1.9 percent. The National  Institute of Geography, Statistics, and Data Processing (INEGI)  has remarked that by the end of 1993 the total population  numbered 85.8 million people, while the GDP totaled $324  billion. INEGI concluded per capita income averaged $3,760 in  1993. (Mexico City LA JORNADA in Spanish 4 April 94 pp 1, 22)</p>

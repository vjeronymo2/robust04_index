			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter He Jun: "Call To Develop Minority </F> Districts"]    [Text] The ethnic minority policy will be guided by the  principles of unity, progress, stability and development, the  State Nationalities Affairs Commission conference was told  yesterday.    If these principles are followed ethnic relations will  improve and China's national unity and social stability will be  protected, Commission Vice-Chairman Chen Hong said.    Inter-ethnic relations improved markedly last year, as  economic developments began to spread from the coastal areas to  the interior and border regions, Chen said.    But increasing contact between the different nationality  cultures had led to unavoidable arguments and conflict,  Commission Minister Ismail Amat told the conference.    Amat urged central and local nationalities affairs  departments to strengthen their conflict resolution work so as  to safeguard social stability.    And he encouraged his colleagues to continue the fight  against hostile forces from inside and outside China that  attempted to split the country by playing the ethnic issue card.    Another national conference will be held in September this  year to honour individuals and collectives that have made  outstanding contributions to the unity and progress of Chinese  nationalities, Chen said.    And he encouraged local government to arrange forums to push  forward the nationalities work. And they should select nominees  for the national honours.    Amat stressed the need to further strengthen the legislation  on nationalities affairs and promote the reform and opening up  in the ethnic regions.</p>

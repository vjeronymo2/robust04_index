			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries soften ahead of Fed meeting US Treasury bond prices softened in light trading yesterday as the market braced itself for a move by the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  3/32 lower at 99 13/32 , with the yield rising to 7.504 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was down  1/32 at 99 3/4 , to yield 6.244 per cent. With the Fed set to convene its policy-making session today, traders were convinced a rate increase was inevitable. Last week's data on inflation and retail sales, coupled with the continued strength of the employment market, provided ample evidence for the central bank to tighten credit conditions for the fifth time this year, according to most analysts. Yesterday's economic news did nothing to undermine that view. The Fed announced a 0.2 per cent increase in industrial production last month, while capacity utilisation - an important barometer of incipient price pressures - held steady at 83.9 per cent. While the July figures represented a slowdown, the data were still well above a level which would suggest the economy had shifted into low gear. Still, the reaction was muted, as a rate increase appeared to be already priced into Treasury bonds. Prices dipped on the news, edged back just before mid-day and receded again during the late afternoon. The only outstanding question was whether the bank would lift the Federal Funds rate by 25 or 50 basis points. A more aggressive move could prove to be a positive development for the inflation-sensitive long end of the maturity range. Analysts said a 50-point increase would demonstrate the central bank's vigilance against inflation. In addition, it would not leave the market wondering if yet another small rate increase was just around the corner. Still, most analysts were expecting the Fed to strike the more cautious course. 'There is still too much uncertainty regarding the economy's performance for the Fed to firm by more than 25 points,' said Mr Elliot Platt of Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, the New York securities house. The public holiday in many parts of Europe crippled trading in the government bond markets which were open for business yesterday. However, dealers are preparing themselves for a sudden increase in activity in the event of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates today. 'This is an important week for bond markets despite the deceptively quiet atmosphere,' said Ms Wendy Niffikeer of IBJ International. The market is also waiting for guidance from the Bundesbank, which is due to resume its fortnightly council meetings on Thursday after the four-week summer break. The scheduled run of four fixed-rate repos, set at 4.85 per cent, comes to an end this week. Ms Niffikeer said the market's attention had shifted away from a rate cut in Germany, following last week's rises in Italy and Sweden. Nevertheless, she believed a decision to keep the repo fixed at 4.85 per cent would be damaging to an already fragile market. 'Any cut in the repo would be favourable,' she said. The market is clearly divided about the Bundesbank's intentions. Ms Alison Cottrell, international economist at Midland Global Markets, believes the gap of 35 basis points between the repo and the discount rates, although wide in theory, may be too tight to allow the Bundesbank to return to its preferred variable repo rate. 'In the absence of an official rate cut, do not expect the repo rate to look too dissimilar to 4.85 per cent - whether fixed or variable,' she advises. Mr Holger Fahrinkrug of UBS in Frankfurt says a return to variable repos should be seen as confirmation that the Bundesbank sees scope for a further discount rate cut. Activity in both cash and futures markets was quiet yesterday. On Liffe, the September bund future was virtually unchanged at 91.57 with 56,338 contracts traded. The September long gilt future rose  1/16 to 100 3/4 . The Bank of England said two tranches of index-linked bonds totalling Pounds 200m were exhausted yesterday. Dealers estimated that as much as 90 per cent of the Pounds 500m of outstanding taps was still unsold.</p>

			<p><P> September 11, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> GROCERS RECRUITS IN PESTICIDES WAR  </P> <P> An environmental group, the National Toxics Campaign, announced today it has  signed up a half-dozen grocery chains in a pledge to shift growers away from  using pesticides, especially cancer-causing chemicals.  </P> <P> Environmentalists called the agreement a major breakthrough, although it  amounted to little more than a general pledge to work toward elimination of  pesticide use.  </P> <P> "This is the beginning of a national campaign," said Craig Merrilees of the  National Toxics Campaign, calling the pact a "first of a kind . . . dramatic  breakthrough" for the environmental movement.  </P> <P> The participants represent fewer than 200 stores in the United States and are  firms primarily in California and Arizona -- Raley's with 55 stores in the  Sacramento area and Abco Supermarkets with about 60 stores in Arizona -- that  have broken ranks before with their industry colleagues on the pesticide issue.  </P></p>

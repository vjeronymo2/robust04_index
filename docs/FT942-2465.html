			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Dehaene to run for Brussels presidency: Belgian PM's candidacy increases prospects of deadlock at EU's Corfu summit Prospects of a deadlock at next week's summit of European Union leaders on the choice of a successor to Mr Jacques Delors as European Commission president increased yesterday as Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, Belgium's prime minister, formally declared himself a candidate. Within an hour of the announcement, senior government allies of Mr Ruud Lubbers, the retiring Dutch prime minister, underlined at a press conference in the Hague that the Netherlands would not consider withdrawing Mr Lubbers' candidacy. The Dutch premier, until recently considered the front-runner for the job, had announced he was seeking the job in May, but delayed a formal declaration until after last month's general elections in the Netherlands - in which his Christian Democrats lost their position as leading party. Mr Dehaene, also a Christian Democrat, was in April approached by President Francois Mitterrand of France and then Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany to make himself available for the job, according to Belgian officials. But until yesterday he had refused to confirm he was seeking Mr Delors' mantle. Mr Dehaene said he was making his candidacy public to remove all doubt that he had the full backing of the Belgian government, which published a statement calling for the support of Belgium's EU partners at the EU summit in Corfu next Friday. Fears have been expressed that Belgium's centre-left coalition could fall apart if Mr Dehaene steps down. If both these Christian Democrats from small member states fight to the end, they risk letting in an outside candidate. Sir Leon Brittan, the British EU trade commissioner, has campaigned openly for the job all year, with discreet backing from the UK. Mr Peter Sutherland, outgoing director general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, made clear he was available last month. Although his chances were dismissed by his government in Ireland, some senior EU officials still believe Mr Sutherland has an outside chance as a tie-breaker in the event of a stand-off in Corfu. Sir Leon's chances are marred because Britain held the job, with Lord (Roy) Jenkins in the early 1980s, because the UK's partners are suspicious of its intentions towards European Union, and because by convention, after the 10-year tenure of the Frenchman Mr Delors, the job should now fall to a small member-state. Christian Democrat leaders meet in Brussels on Wednesday to try to agree a single candidate. This would be likely only if Mr Lubbers could be found a commensurate international position, such as secretary general of Nato, a job not in the EU gift. The Dutch premier was in Rome yesterday to lobby Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister being assiduously courted by all candidates as a 'swing vote' at Corfu. Amid this jockeying for top international positions, Mr Dehaene remarked yesterday that if he was not chosen, 'I still have my job' as Belgian premier. Greece has nominated Mr Christos Papoutsis of the governing Panhellenic Socialist Movement as its European commissioner for environmental affairs, write Kerin Hope in Athens and William Lewis in London. Mr Papoutsis, seen as a Pasok moderate, was re-elected to the European parliament last week. He would replace Mr Yannis Paleocrassas, a conservative former finance minister. The nomination has caused irritation in Brussels, where officials say protocol has been broken. 'The idea was to wait until the new president had been nominated and then let him have a certain influence in composing his team,' one official said. The nomination appears to be aimed at pre-empting yet another dispute within Pasok.</p>

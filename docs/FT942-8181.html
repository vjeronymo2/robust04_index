			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Tories kill disabled bill amid Commons disarray A backbench bill banning discrimination against the disabled was killed amid farcical scenes in the Commons yesterday, as ministers fought off a procedural ambush by opposition MPs. The parliamentary wrangling ended all hope of further progress for the Civil Rights (Disabled Persons) bill, which ministers say would have cost industry Pounds 17bn. But the outcome looked like a pyrrhic victory for the government, with all the hallmarks of a public relations disaster. The first casualty could be Mr Nicholas Scott, minister for the disabled, who appeared deeply uneasy as he mounted a lone filibuster against the bill. Mr Scott has already come under pressure to resign after being forced to apologise for misleading MPs by denying that the government had drafted amendments for Tory backbenchers. In a further embarrassment for Mr Scott, his humiliation at the despatch box was watched by his daughter Victoria, a campaigner for the disabled, who was assisting opposition MPs. 'I think it is time we had a minister for disabled people who represented the needs of disabled people,' a deeply upset Miss Scott said afterwards. The wrangling began yesterday, when Mr Roger Berry, Labour MP for Kingswood, the bill's sponsor, accepted more than 80 amendments tabled by Tory MPs attempting to use up the bill's parliamentary time. The bill's supporters, who included a handful of Tories, thought Mr Berry's manoeuvre would allow rapid progress towards a final vote on the principle of the bill. But as Mr Scott struggled to keep the debate going, government whips spotted that the House was inquorate - mainly because many Labour MPs were in Edinburgh for the funeral of Mr John Smith, the late party leader. A government MP called for a vote to close the debate, a device usually used by supporters of a bill trying to stop a filibuster. The vote was carried by 28 votes to one - 11 votes short of the quorum of 40  -obliging the deputy speaker to push the bill to the bottom of a long list of bills queueing for time. Angry opposition MPs claimed that there were at least 12 Conservative MPs in the Commons whose votes would have saved the bill, even if cast against the closure. 'Millions of people outside this place will be disgusted at what they've seen take place here today. We have seen the minister quite cynically talk this Bill out,' Mr Berry said. As if to prove it was not a great day for parliamentary democracy, the government also blocked a backbench bill to reform treasure trove law, apparently by mistake. A government whip cried 'object' when the Treasure Bill's title was read - the traditional way of blocking such legislation. Mr Patrick Cormack, the Conservative sponsor, said the whip had 'got himself into a bit of confusion'. It was that sort of day.</p>

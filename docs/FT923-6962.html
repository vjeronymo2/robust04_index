			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Hafnia Danish institutions must be rueing their decision to reject what looked like a perfectly reasonable bid for Hafnia by the Swedish insurer Skandia earlier this year. News yesterday that Hafnia has effectively sought protection from its creditors - less than two months after the completion of a DK2bn rights issue - underlines the price paid for what at the time looked like anti-Maastricht style nationalism. The question mark now is over Uni Storebrand, the Norwegian company with which Hafnia ill-fatedly tried to build a pan-Scandinavian insurance alliance. If shareholders are asked to bail it out of trouble they will no doubt take note of the Hafnia example.</p>

			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / BP board in big reshuffle: Chairman and chief executive appointed from within in first shake-up since 1992 coup ousted Horton British Petroleum is to promote a new chairman and chief executive from within its ranks in the first big reshuffle since the boardroom coup of 1992. Lord Ashburton, the chairman who led the coup against the former chairman and chief executive Mr Robert Horton, is to retire next July 1. He will be succeeded by Mr David Simon, the current chief executive. He in turn will be succeeded by Mr John Browne, head of the company's exploration arm. Lord Ashburton had always intended to step down after three years as chairman, and the changes announced yesterday were 'an example of continuity'. The timing of the announcement, on Budget Day, was dictated by the need to inform staff before a top-level planning session for 1995 which begins tonight. Those involved in the changes stressed that they did not imply any shift in the strategy which BP set itself after the ousting of Mr Horton. This is based on a drive to reduce the company's large debts, tighten the integration of its operations, and achieve 'disciplined growth'. All the executives involved in the reshuffle have been closely involved in managing BP's recovery from the losses which resulted from Mr Horton's expansionist strategies. Mr Simon, who took over as chief executive in 1992, will become a non-executive chairman, spending three or four days a week at BP. He said it was important to separate the role of chairman and chief executive. Mr Browne, who is 47, has held a variety of posts at BP including group treasurer. Most recently he headed a successful expansion of the company's oil and gas reserves. The new head of exploration will be Mr Rodney Chase, the managing director with responsibility for the western hemisphere and corporate affairs. Mr Russell Seal, chief executive of BP Oil, the downstream arm, will take on a new set of responsibilities to oversee the further integration of the group. His position will be taken by Mr Rolf Stomberg who heads BP's European oil operations. The announcement of the changes comes at the end of a year in which BP's finances have staged a solid recovery. In the first quarter, the company paid its first dividend increase since the coup, and by the third quarter it had reduced its debts from Dollars 16bn to around Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6bn). The company has also been boosted by substantial oil discoveries in Colombia and west of Shetlands, as well as a recent gas find in Vietnam. Mr Browne intended to seek further growth for the company by emphasising the role of gas. He also saw opportunities to 'deepen' BP's position in the refining and downstream markets, such as in eastern Europe and Asia. BP's chemicals business had undergone expansion which would enable it to take advantage of the current upswing in chemical markets. Mr Simon said that BP's dividend policy would continue to be reviewed on a a quarterly basis. 'We would like to progressively grow the dividend if we have a sustainable financial performance,' he said.</p>

			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Verbundnetzgas signs agreement with Norwegian consortium Verbundnetzgas, eastern Germany's regional gas company, yesterday signed a long term natural gas contract with a Norwegian consortium aimed at reducing its dependence on Russian gas, as well as shifting domestic consumption away from brown coal to natural gas. Starting in 1996, the consortium will deliver 4bn cubic metres a year to VNG which supplies about 90 per cent of the gas market in eastern Germany. Officials said that natural gas consumption in eastern Germany, now about 9bn cubic metres a year, was expected to rise to 20bn after 2000 as more towns and cities in the region switched their domestic heating from gas generated from brown coal to natural gas.</p>

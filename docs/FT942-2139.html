			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / Technology: A cross-border people project - Staff at Hoechst were thoroughly involved in the introduction of a new system / Software at Work Gerhard Storch, financial director of Hoechst UK, is well-versed in promoting the idea of a global accounting system. He has a prepared presentation, complete with slides. The project has an inspirational name, Apollo, with its own sunrise logo. Stories about it appear regularly in the Hoechst newsletter. Storch is clear about the objectives for Hoechst's system. 'First, it is not an accounting project. We are looking to improve customer service. Nor is it a Gerhard Storch project - it involves everyone in the Hoechst group in Europe. The system we are looking for is likely to improve the service to our European subsidiaries in the area of information delivery.' Global systems, especially global accounting systems, are cost effective, enforce standards and bring together different information sources. The German-based Hoechst group is far from alone in its desire to implement such systems across national borders, but few companies can have looked into the idea so thoroughly, and done so much to prepare the ground - and the people. With annual sales of DM46bn (Pounds 18.4bn), Hoechst ranks among the world's chemical industry leaders. Founded 125 years ago, it was the originator of the vivid dyes that brightened clothes fabrics in the late 19th century. Now, it has interests in chemicals, pharmaceuticals, fibres, polymers and paints. Its operations in 120 countries include research laboratories in 15 of them, and it employs 170,000 people worldwide. 'We have a target that our European business should operate in a seamless way in its information flow,' says Storch, 'whether it comes from marketing information or in the process of receiving orders, planning, processing and, ultimately, delivering to the customer. People need accurate, up-to-date information to know that they can deliver to the customer on time.' There are problems to surmount in introducing such compatibility: agreement on aims and universal requirements in-house; choice of software; the weaning of people from their trusted software packages; and, finally, the development of new approaches. Choice of software was relatively straightforward. Many suppliers claim to offer software that is global, multi-currency, flexible and capable of being customised to the degree Hoechst needed. But Hoechst found few real contenders, especially as it had not yet moved to open systems and was still planning to use its mainframe computers. However, one German division was an enthusiastic user of the German-originated SAP accounting software. The group was thus convinced that this modular package offered the most flexible and full-function solution available. It chose SAP's R/2 software for international use on its IBM 3090 and 9021 mainframes. (SAP now offers a Unix-based package, R/3, which arrived too late for Hoechst.) There were a few deficiencies, made good by developments in SAP's own software language. For example, Hoechst needed a credit management module and undertook a joint development with SAP in the UK to replace a Pounds 500,000 in-house software project. In spite of lower functionality, this write-off was a sacrifice worth making for the integration with other SAP modules. Altogether, the investment from the UK, which piloted the development, was roughly Pounds 3m; with seven other European countries involved - France, Austria, Spain, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany (co-ordinator) - the total cost was thus around Pounds 21m. A Hoechst man for 33 years, Storch did not underestimate the difficulty of weaning users from their existing systems, some of which had been international. These included a bespoke sales order processing system used in the UK, France, Italy, Spain and South Africa, and the mainframe accounting software that MSA (now Dun and Bradstreet) implemented in the UK, Spain, and South Africa 10 years earlier. Storch was keen to transfer his company-wide vision to the people who would use the software. He set up committees in each of the countries contributing to the development. 'We felt that a public relations effort was the only way to get it off the ground by a corporate agreement, not a central directive. It was essential that it be led by national companies. A global strategy for information systems has to rely on co-operation and communications, not imposing or prescribing.' Each team had subcommittees, chaired by the division director. Some countries provided specialist expertise: Spain and Italy on re-valuation of assets, for example, and Belgium on VAT rules. Meeting every six weeks or so, the committees wrestled with the details of what turned out to be a rich but complex solution. Some extra modules - cost accounting, and a transport system for dangerous goods - were a part of the UK pilot. 'It's very complex. It requires a great amount of know-how in development and in presentation. Also, it is complex for users, and needs a lot of training. People have to learn as they go along, but we have also had to cope with differences in language and culture,' says Storch. IT organisation manager John Haywood was part of the change management committee. 'We have had to train 400 users in the UK, some of whom have never seen a terminal,' he says. 'We implemented the scheme through a series of workshops, mixing IT people and end users, so that they learned on the hoof about business processes.' Even so, there were logistical problems - some to do with warehousing control and computerisation and others with employees' inexperience. The live switch was thrown on the entire system, including three new modules, on the May bank holiday weekend this year. Some 409 users are spread across the UK headquarters west of London in the accounting, chemicals and pharmaceuticals divisions. 'After a couple of weeks live with 409 UK users there were comparatively few problems. But we are in the hands of one central software developer - through seven national suppliers in the countries, with the master development in Germany,' says Haywood. SAP, inevitably, has its own agenda. Product updates and releases cause problems to companies such as Hoechst, even though such maintenance is done centrally. SAP's new R/3 software is still going through implementation in its first live sites. Other companies agree on the extremely rich functions available with SAP, even though, according to Storch, 'only 25 per cent of the functionality is exploited by any one company'. Mike Demetriou, group chief accountant, has been using SAP software since the first implementation of bought sales and general ledgers two years ago. The newly implemented modules for production costing and sales, RKK and RKE, bring a fresh dimension to his job. They integrate all the information entered in sales and production to produce a detailed analysis at any level. This means he can take a detailed view, by date, customer, invoice and product, of any data. 'I log on daily looking at, for instance, total company performance at the end of the month. If I see a result I don't like, I can go into the hierarchy and look at major divisions, starting to select the route - for example, pharmaceuticals. 'You don't need anyone else to make an inquiry for you - you can do it all yourself, working right down into the detail. If a senior manager doesn't like what he sees in the pharmaceutical budgets, for example, one keystroke will show all the costs that contributed: salaries, travelling, right down to specific transactions - someone's foreign trip. He doesn't have to call in anyone else, so long as he's trained.' Business managers now have a broader knowledge of accounting, and accountants have a broader view of the business. Hoechst's main investment, as Storch constantly emphasises, is not in the system but the people.</p>

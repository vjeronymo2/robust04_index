The message reiterated Jordan's keenness to  see the accord document translated on the ground as an  achievement that concerns the Arab nation as well as the Yemeni  people.

The  president told him he and the Yemeni people were appreciative of  His Majesty King Husayn's and the Jordanian people's pan-Arab  attitude and genuine concern for unity and democracy in our  country. The president said he appreciated that Jordan was  doing all it could to help Yemen ride out the tough challenges  left by the political crisis. President Salih noted that these  efforts were crowned by Amman hosting the gathering of Yemeni  political and social figures to witness the ceremonies for  signing the accord document. Our people, the president told Dr.  al-Karaki, will always recognize Jordan's brotherly stands that  dramatize the profundity of ties between the two brother peoples.    The president asked him to convey his greetings to his  brother His Majesty King Husayn and best wishes for the  brotherly Jordanian people.

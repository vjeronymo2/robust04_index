			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / World Trade News: Vanished satellite 'may have blown up' AN Australian satellite which disappeared after being launched by a Chinese rocket may have been damaged by an explosion, a Hong Kong newspaper with close links to Beijing said yesterday. Wen Wei Po, a Chinese-language daily, said fragments recovered by a Sino/US investigating team suggested the explosion occurred after the satellite was deployed. The report echoes findings by the US journal Aviation Week and Space News which this week said the nose 'shroud', or cone, of the rocket disintegrated at 23,000ft, exposing the satellite to a 1,000mph slipstream that destroyed it. If the reports are confirmed by official investigations, it would damage China's efforts to break into the lucrative satellite launch market dominated by western companies, which charge high prices for their services. The newspaper reiterated earlier claims by China's Aerospace Ministry that the accident was not caused by a failure of the Long March rocket used to launch the satellite from south-west China last month. The Dollars 138m (Pounds 90.7m) satellite was built by Hughes Aircraft, the US aerospace group, for Optus Communications, an Australian telecommunications company which planned to use it for phone and broadcasting services. Optus has said it expects Hughes to supply a replacement satellite as part of a ADollars 500m (Pounds 226.2m) contract to build and launch the two satellites. The replacement one could be launched within 18 months. China launched its first satellite for an overseas client in April 1990, when a Long March rocket put Asiasat-1 into geostationary orbit for a Hong Kong-based consortium. Optus is owned by BellSouth of the US, Cable and Wireless of the UK, and Mayne Nickless, the Australian transport group.</p>

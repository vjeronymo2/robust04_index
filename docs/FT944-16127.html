			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / International Company News: Raytheon reports 22% increase in profits Raytheon, the Massa-chusetts-based defence company best known for its Patriot missile, produced record third-quarter earnings of Dollars 1.45 a share, an increase of 15 per cent. On sales up 10 per cent for the quarter at Dollars 2.4bn, operating profits rose 22 per cent at Dollars 273m. After lower non-operating income, net profits were up 12 per cent at Dollars 192m. However, the results were seen as disappointing, and the shares fell Dollars 1 3/4 to close at Dollars 63. Mr Dennis Picard, chairman, said lower defence spending had led to a fall in sales and profits in government business. But the non-defence businesses of engineering, construction, aircraft and appliances all enjoyed a record third quarter. The company said that 51 per cent of its Dollars 6.9bn order backlog was funded by the US government against 65 per cent a year ago. Over that period, government orders fell 16 per cent and civilian orders rose 50 per cent. Civilian orders received in the quarter included a Dollars 364m contract for Acme Steel in Illinois and a Dollars 1bn-plus environmental surveillance project in Brazil, won in competition with the French defence group Thomson. Total debt fell Dollars 350m to Dollars 639m, giving a debt-equity ratio of 14.9 per cent. Loral, the acquisitive US defence company, produced a 39 per cent gain in second-quarter earnings per share, or 25 per cent before non-recurring items. Bernard Schwartz, chairman, said he now expected full-year net income to rise by more than the previous forecast of 20 per cent, without further acquisitions or the non-recurring gain. Sales in the quarter rose 61 per cent to Dollars 1.35bn, reflecting the acquisition of Federal Systems from January. Net income was up 42 per cent at Dollars 66.3m, or by 27 per cent before the one-off gain of Dollars 6.9m.</p>

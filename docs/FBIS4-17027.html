			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Appeal by the Ukrainian Peace Council and by the Ukrainian </F> Peace Foundation"; Kiev, 14 April 1994]    [Text] The peace-loving public of Ukraine has been, and  continues to seek the suspension of the operation of the  Chernobyl Atomic Electric Power Plant [AES]. We sincerely  rejoiced when the Supreme Council adopted its decision on  suspending the operation of this notorious monster. However,  unfortunately, ignoring public opinion and without holding a  nationwide discussion, a decision was adopted in secrecy not  only on the resumption of the Chernobyl AES operation, but also  on commissioning new units at the Zaporizhzhya, Khmelnytskyy,  and Rivne AES, as well as on a significant expansion over the  whole of atomic power engineering and even on the creation in  Ukraine of a nuclear-fuel cycle, starting from the extraction of  uranium ore and ending with reprocessing radioactive waste and  its burial. We reiterate that all of this is being planned  without the public's knowledge.    At the same time, the International Atomic Energy Agency, as  a result of the work of its commission at the Chernobyl AES,  arrived at the conclusion that there are many "unresolved  problems" at the plant.    For eight years, Chernobyl and other Ukrainian atomic plants  have been giving rise to alarm in European countries. The  European public, just like us, demands that the dangerous  reactors be stopped.    Stressing again the inadmissibility of ignoring public  opinion, we are calling upon the Ukrainian president to suspend  the action of the unpublished edict on the development of atomic  power engineering in Ukraine and to carry an extensive and open  discussion of this burning problem.    Kiev, 14 April 1994</p>

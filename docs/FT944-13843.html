			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Scientists predict tiny processors Researchers yesterday announced a breakthrough in electronic miniaturisation which could lead to computer memories and microprocessors 500 times faster than today's silicon chips and one-five hundredth the size. Scientists at Toshiba Cambridge Research Centre and Cambridge University have developed the world's first process for making 'quantum effect integrated circuits'. These devices consist of millions of microscopically small components on a chip the size of a fingernail. Professor Michael Pepper, managing director of the research centre, said that the achievement was of comparable significance to the discovery in 1958 of the technology for making integrated circuits on silicon instead of connecting together individual transistors. That breakthrough led to the information technology revolution which started in the early 1970s and is still gathering pace. Many electronics laboratories have made such microscopic components, including 'quantum wires' one-hundred thousandth the thickness of human hair. But their individual production is painstakingly slow and expensive. The microscopic components - no more than 10 atoms across - are so small that the electrons in them behave both as particles and waves, in accordance with the bizarre predictions of quantum theory. This allows the circuits to switch far faster than those in conventional chips. The Toshiba process makes it possible to mass produce them on integrated circuits like conventional chips. The process has several stages and is technically complex, but Prof Pepper said it was 'highly manufacturable and could readily be transferred to a production environment' at reasonable cost. The main technical barrier to overcome is that the quantum devices can only operate when cooled in liquid helium to temperatures close to absolute zero. Scientists can, however, foresee them being developed to work at room temperature. Chips based on the technology could reach the market in about 10 years. There are many possible applications, including super-fast memory and logic circuits for computers and more precisely controllable lasers. Mr Sei-Ichi Takayanagi, Toshiba's senior adviser on research, said the technology was still too far from the market to transfer to the company's Japanese research and development laboratories. It would be developed in Cambridge for about five years - and licensed to any other companies that wanted to use it. Prof Pepper predicted that many new applications would emerge which no one had yet thought of. He said: 'Think of all the changes in computing and communications in the last 25 years, and try to extrapolate those 25 years ahead.'</p>

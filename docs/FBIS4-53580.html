			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of report issued by former Foreign Affairs Secretary </F> Raul Manglapus on 19 May; place not given -- read by announcer]    [Text] We have just returned from Jakarta, where we carried  out upon the instructions of President Ramos a special mission  to Indonesia. We conveyed a letter from the president to  President Suharto concerning the proposed holding in the  Philippines of the meeting on East Timor, an event over which  the Indonesian Government had expressed its deep concern. We  had the occasion to exchange views on the subject with His  Excellency Ali Alatas, the foreign minister of Indonesia, and  the other officials of the Indonesian Government.    Our talks were characterized by utmost cordiality. We  assured the Indonesian Government of the Philippines' continuing  support for the territorial integrity of the Republic of  Indonesia, including the province of East Timor, support which  President Ramos had earlier reaffirmed in connection with the  proposed conference on East Timor. We recalled the declarations  of President Ramos, Vice President Estrada, and other Philippine  officials that they shared Indonesia's concern over the  implications of the conference. We made it clear that President  Ramos had firmly dissociated the Philippine Government from the  conference. At the same time, we pointed out that the event was  being organized with Philippine private groups and individuals  as formally the hosts, and we stressed that the Philippine  Constitution guarantees freedom of assembly and freedom of  speech and that therefore the Philippine Government is unable to  prevent, under normal circumstances, the conference from taking  place. However, we informed the Indonesian officials that  everything would be done in accordance with the Constitution and  our laws to ensure that this unfortunate development does not  harm the friendly relations between the Philippines and  Indonesia.    Foreign Minister Alatas expressed the gratitude of President  Suharto to President Ramos for sending our mission. He conveyed  the Indonesian Government's appreciation for our explanation and  for the reiteration of the Philippine Government support for the  Indonesian position on East Timor. He stated that other  Indonesian officials had done and have done that Indonesia  understood and respect the Philippine position on constitutional  rule and human rights. [sentence as heard] He declared,  however, that the proposed conference is not simply a matter of  human rights. We noted Minister Alatas' observation that the  scheduled meeting was neither a gathering of human rights nor an  academic exercise but as part of a political action plan of a  small secessionist exile group, using the Philippine conference  to subvert Indonesia's sovereignty on East Timor. We noted that  this small secessionist exile group was giving the central  direction in the organization of the conference.    We recalled the invaluable role which Indonesia has played  in  the Organization of Islamic Conference with respect to our  secessionist problem. The mission expressed the Philippines'  gratitude for this. We and the Indonesians agreed to continue  exchanging views and information on this matter and on the  Philippine-Indonesian relations in general.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The capability to vent pressure from a pipeline should never take the form of bypassing the SDV but should be from the respective ends of the pipelines. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Bidirectional operations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Response <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _Not affected. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Pigging operations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Response_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Subsea valves should be fitted with remote position indicators to ensure the valve is fully open during pigging operations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Question <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _What measures could be taken to enhance performance and reliability_in particular, how could problems identified in response to question one be alleviated? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Locating the SDV above the maximum wave height would alleviate most problems described in question one. Control lines are relatively short and the valve is readily accessible for maintenance and repairs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are designs where safety can be achieved by other methods. There are also ``economical'' platforms where the producer accepts more risk to reduce facility costs. The location of the SDV should be commensurate with the level of protection afforded to other high-risk facilities on the platform. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The SDV's should be manufactured from materials which will avoid valve replacement and offer reliable performance. The valve should have manual actuators and quick connect ends to facilitate operation or removal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Platform operating decks should be made of plate, not grating. Plate acts as a fire wall. If the deck is made of plate, the SDV can be safely located on the deck. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The SDV's should be self-operating and fail-safe closed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Valves should be routinely inspected and tested as well as continuously monitored. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The SDV and control system should be protected from mechanical damage. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Placement of SDV's on the platform would improve reliability but would also minimize their effectiveness. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Redundant control and instrumentation systems may be desirable. Standards should be established for value specifications and certification. Quality control in manufacturing could also enhance their reliability. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Valve technology has advanced to the point that reliable subsea operation is available. Advancement in the areas of a valve failure data base and check valve technology could yield further reliability and performance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Require a surface SDV as well as a subsea valve. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Question <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _What types of SDV's are available that could be located on the seafloor? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Any valve designed for subsea service such as a quarter turn ball valve, check valve, or a gate valve could perform as an SDV. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The use of hydraulically operated valves could present a pollution problem. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is the actuator that needs to be scrutinized. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No existing SDV would likely serve the purpose when located on the seafloor. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Hydraulic or pneumatic systems would be most practical. Some manufacturers have devised an SDV for subsea service. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

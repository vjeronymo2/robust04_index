			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Other allowable indications for products labeled as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> either antiseptic or health-care personnel handwash.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> labeling of the product may also contain the following phrase:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Recommended for repeated use.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other labeling claims requested by the comments for first  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aid antiseptics are not being included in the tentative final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monograph. The agency believes that the general claim ``for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> handwashing to decrease bacteria on the skin'' encompasses the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> variety of uses for promoting good individual and family hygiene.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency tentatively concludes that the labeling statements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed above express the same concepts as the labeling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggested by the comments in language that can be more readily  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> understood by the consumer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Comments on Definitions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 6. One comment objected to a portion of the definition for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> health-care personnel handwash in &sect;333.3(d) of the tentative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> final monograph that states that the antimicrobial agent is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``broad-spectrum'' and ``if possible, persistent.'' The comment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> argued that, because these handwashes are used 50 to 100 times  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> daily, persistence of effect is unnecessary. The comment also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> questioned the need for a broad-spectrum antimicrobial, stating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Staphylococcus epidermidis  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> S. epidermidis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) generally is the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only natural resident bacteria on the skin, and other transient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> micro-organisms are more likely to be removed mechanically by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> washing than by antimicrobial action. The comment suggested that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the choice to use or not to use a broad-spectrum antimicrobial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ingredient should be left to the manufacturer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another comment pointed out that the requirement for ``broad  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> spectrum'' activity is inconsistently applied in the definitions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for health-care personnel handwash, patient preoperative skin  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preparation, and surgical hand scrub (&sect;333.3(d), (e), and (i),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respectively) because ``broad spectrum'' activity is mandatory for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the first two classes and only ``desirable'' for surgical hand  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scrubs. The comment cited comment 93 (43 FR 1210 at 1224) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the testing guidelines for safety and effectiveness of OTC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> topical antimicrobials (43 FR 1239) to show the agency's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> awareness of possible shifts in microbial flora due to a lack of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> broad spectrum activity. The comment urged that all three  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> product classes include the requirement for each product to at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> least demonstrate in vitro ``cidal'' activity against gram-negative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bacteria, fungi, and lipophilic and hydrophilic viruses in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition to the gram-positive activity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In &sect;333.3(d) of the previous tentative final monograph, a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> health-care personnel handwash was defined as an ``*&blank;*&blank;*  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> antimicrobial-containing preparation designed for frequent use;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it reduces the number of transient micro-organisms on intact skin  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to an initial baseline level after adequate washing, rinsing, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> drying, and it is broad-spectrum, fast acting, and, if possible,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> persistent.'' In the tentative final monograph, the agency agreed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the Panel that persistence, defined as prolonged activity, is a valuable attribute that assures antimicrobial activity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during the interval between washings and is important to a safe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and effective health-care personnel handwash (43 FR 1215). The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Panel explained that a property such as persistence, which acts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to prevent the growth or establishment of transient micro-organisms as part of the normal baseline or resident flora, would be an added benefit (39 FR 33103 at 33115). Although the Panel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> did not propose persistence as a mandatory requirement for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> health-care personnel handwash, the agency is retaining the words  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``if possible, persistent'' in the definition in this amended  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tentative final monograph because this is a desirable trait for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regarding the comment's objection to the broad-spectrum  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement, the Panel in its discussion of the normal skin flora  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stated that the predominant members of the normal flora are gram  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> positive cocci and diptheroids and not  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> S. epidermidis, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  as the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment indicates. The Panel stated further that a small number  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of gram negative species, such as coliforms and related micro- <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organisms, as well as higher forms such as yeast may also be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> residents of the skin of healthy individuals (39 FR 33103 at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 33107). In its discussion of health-care personnel handwash drug  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products, the Panel acknowledged that, in all likelihood, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specified effect of these products (i.e., removal of transient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> micro-organisms) can be achieved with a well formulated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonantimicrobial soap or detergent product. However, the Panel concluded that transient micro-organisms may become part of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> established ``resident'' flora with time, and stated that in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> health-care situation, the fast, effective removal of transient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> micro-organisms is a requirement because they may be pathogenic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (39 FR 33103 at 33115). The Panel recommended that health-care  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> personnel handwash drug products containing an antimicrobial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ingredient should be broad spectrum. The Panel defined ``broad  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> spectrum'' in reference to microbiological activity as meaning the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> antimicrobial has activity against more than one type of micro- <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organism, that is, activity against gram positive and gram  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> negative bacteria, fungi, and viruses (39 FR 33115). Because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transient micro-organisms present on the skin may include widely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> diverse species, resulting from contact with contaminated persons  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and materials, the agency concludes that a greater reduction of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transient micro-organisms on the skin can be achieved if the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> antimicrobial containing drug product used as a health-care  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> personnel handwash provides broad spectrum activity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

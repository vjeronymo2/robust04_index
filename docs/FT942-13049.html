			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / Clergy income reform planned New ways of financing pensions for Church of England clergy will be proposed later this year following an Pounds 800m decline in the Church Commissioners' income-producing assets, the Commons social security committee was told yesterday. Dr George Carey, Archbishop of Canterbury, and other church leaders faced questioning by the committee as part of its inquiry into the operation of pension funds. Under existing arrangements, the commissioners finance clergy pensions out of annual income. However Mr Phillip Mawer, secretary-general of the Church of England general synod, told the committee that if this arrangement continued, pension liabilities were likely to consume the commissioners' entire asset income by 2010. The alternative of a contributory scheme is being considered. Present thinking, said Mr Mawer, was that dioceses rather than individual clergy should make the contributions. Dr Carey gave a firm undertaking that the church had 'resources to manage the pension issue'. Clergy pension rights were not in danger. The Church of England is being forced to raise more money from parishes following the heavy decline in the commissioners' assets, due largely to over exposure in property investments. Dr Carey said that a Financial Times report which first detailed the commissioners' difficulties two years ago had been a 'stunning blow to many of us', although he had been aware to some degree of the seriousness of the problem before that.</p>

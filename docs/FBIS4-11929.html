			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Insufficient Step"] </F>   [Text] After yesterday's Cairo agreement between the PLO  and Israel to deploy a temporary international presence in  Hebron, and then to resume self-rule negotiations on Monday [4  April], the Israeli authorities began, as usual, to belittle the  importance of this step, considered the first of its kind since  Israel occupied the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Israeli officials  began to stress that Hebron sovereignty is Israel's alone and  that this step was taken to calm the situation and explore  efforts to bring life back to normal.    It seems Israeli acceptance of this step has three  objectives. The first is to bring the Palestinian party back to  the table of self-rule negotiations in order to implement the  Gaza-Jericho First accord. The Palestinian and Israeli  delegations began negotiations immediately after signing the  agreement. The second objective is to absorb the vengeance and  anger of Palestinian citizens in Hebron and the occupied Arab  territories in the wake of the massacre and the consequent  killing, terrorism, and siege. The third objective is to  mislead world public opinion and circumvent the world protest  that accompanied and followed the massacre in the holy  al-Ibrahimi Mosque and, since then, the continuing coercion.    Despite its importance and significance, this step is not  enough to prevent more massacres, terrorism, and deliberate  killing in the Hebron area, Jerusalem, and the occupied Arab  territories. This will be especially true as long as the  occupied territories are planted with settlements and as long as  the Israeli Government is providing weapons, support, and  protection for the settlers, and even considers them a  complementary part of its political and security policy.    What happened in Hebron happened before in Jerusalem, 'Ayn  Qara, Dayr Yasin, Qibya, and in Gaza, a few days ago. There are  plenty of examples. It is likely to happen again anywhere, any  time. The Zionist objective has not changed, namely, land  without people.    What is really needed to end the attacks on defenseless  citizens is eliminating the settlements, ousting the settlers  from inside and outside Hebron and from the occupied  territories, and providing real and effective international  protection for the Palestinian people, paving the way to the end  of the occupation.</p>

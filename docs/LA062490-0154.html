			<p><P> June 24, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE RIGHT THING  </P> <P> Regarding "Doing the Right Thing," by Clancy Sigal (April 29): It is almost  hilarious, but utterly appalling, that Young Americans for Freedom attack the  ideology that provides them with license and the freedom to stand on their hind  legs and howl. Were they alive at the time of the men who founded this country,  these crankies would be soundly spanked, their mouths washed out with soap and  sent back to King George's England for some further seasoning.  </P> <P> This democracy is blessed in that it has not fallen prey to those who believe  they are the only true patriots.  </P> <P> MALCOLM WITTMAN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

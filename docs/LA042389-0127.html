			<p><P> April 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARKANSAS DERBY;  </P> <P> DANSIL HUGS RAIL TO BEAT CLEVER TREVOR  </P> <P> In races all week long, jockeys at Oaklawn Park avoided the rail. Until  Saturday.  </P> <P> Frank Brothers, trainer of Dansil, worked a couple of horses in the morning and  passed the word to his rider, Larry Snyder, to hug the rail.  </P> <P> "I felt like the rail was pretty good, I don't know what the so-called experts  think," Brothers said after Snyder followed the strategy and won the $400,000  Arkansas Derby by three-quarters of a length over Clever Trevor.  </P> <P> "I didn't think it was a disadvantage. When I walked across to saddle him, I  kind of looked down and walked a few steps either way. I told him, 'Whatever  you do, don't get off the rail; don't let the field swarm him where he loses  his position."  </P> <P> Brothers said he expected Dansil to be about fourth in the field of 11  3-year-olds, but the complexion of the race changed when favored Manastash  Ridge stumbled badly coming out of the gate -- and went on to finish ninth.  </P> <P> Clever Trevor, winner of the Remington Park Derby, went to the front, and  Dansil -- breaking from the No. 1 post position -- went with him.  </P> <P> Clever Trevor, ridden by Don Pettinger, was a length in front of Dansil after a  half-mile in a quick :45 3/5. Snyder, who has been among Oaklawn's leading  riders for almost three decades, inched his horse along the rail and took a  short lead as the field headed into the turn.  </P> <P> Dansil led by more than a length in the stretch and then held off Clever  Trevor.  </P> <P> For Snyder, 46, it was his first Arkansas Derby victory. "I can't explain what  it means," he said.  </P> <P> Dansil returned $20, $8.60 and $5.20 after running the 1 1/8 miles in 1:49 1/5.  Clever Trevor paid $5.60 and $4.00, and Advocate Training's show price was  $4.40.  </P></p>

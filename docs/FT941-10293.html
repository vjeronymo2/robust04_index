			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / Safety measures target new drivers A package of measures to reduce accidents and casualties involving newly qualified drivers was announced yesterday by the government, Charles Batchelor writes. A new driver convicted of a serious driving offence will have to re-sit the driving test. A separate theory test for all candidates will be introduced by 1996. Newly qualified drivers will be offered voluntary training to improve their skills, and education programmes for use in schools and colleges will be developed for new and prospective drivers. Drivers aged between 17 and 21 represent only 10 per cent of licence holders but are involved in 20 per cent of accidents, the Department of Transport said. They account for 25 per cent of road deaths.</p>

			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Currencies It would have been nice for the UK government if yesterday's Spanish rate cut had created some leeway for sterling in the ERM. In the event, the pound remained at its floor against the peseta and both currencies slipped against the D-Mark. If there is to be a UK interest rate cut before the election, it looks as though the government will simply have to ignore the ERM constraint and hope the peseta continues to move with sterling. That is a risky course, which probably explains why the authorities appear bent on deferring action as long as possible. The danger of delay is that a poll-conscious market might infer that the government had lost faith in its ability to win the election. In that case the opportunity to cut might never materialise.</p>

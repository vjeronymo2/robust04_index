			<p><P> July 21, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LIMITING SALES OF SPRAY PAINT TO CURB GRAFFITI  </P> <P> Concerning the editorial regarding graffiti I would like to point out a few  other people and organizations also working on this problem.  </P> <P> We must congratulate Sen. Torres for his legislation.  </P> <P> Locking up the cans is probably where it will go. Most of paint used for  graffiti is stolen.  </P> <P> There is another bill in the Legislature sponsored by Assemblyman Richard Katz  (D-Sylmar) which will put a tax on spray paint and this revenue will be used  for graffiti cleanup and educational work related to gangs.  </P> <P> Many Los Angeles officials have worked together with VOICE over the past year  on a major anti-graffiti campaign. Valley Organized in Community Efforts  (VOICE) is a coalition of churches and synagogues in the San Fernando Valley.  The City Council is proposing to lock up spray paint cans and use non-jail  sentencing to clean up graffiti.  </P> <P> Hopefully, all this work will come to fruition very soon.  </P> <P> SANFORD DU ROFF  </P> <P> Tarzana  </P></p>

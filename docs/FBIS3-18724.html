			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Bonn Guarantees Armament Exports"] </F>   [Text] The Federal Government is supporting armament  exports -- to crisis regions as well -- by issuing Hermes  guarantees. Exports of militarily relevant goods, that are  subsidized by Bonn, have increased, according to a study by the  International Economy and Development Organization. They  tripled in 1993 compared with the previous year, reaching more  than 2.2 billion German marks [DM]. Thus, Indonesia bought 39  ships of the former National People's Army. For the  refurbishing, the Federal Government promises coverage of  approximately DM699 million. For the purchase of submarines,  Bonn guarantees another DM665 million. The delivery of MBB  BO-105 and BK-117 helicopters to Argentina, Botswana, Swaziland,  the Philippines, and the Czech Republic is also guaranteed by  the Federal Government. How quickly armament export can become  a problem is shown by the example of Argentina: Secured by  Hermes guarantees, Germany supplied submarines to Argentina in  1977. Argentina later used one of these submarines in the  Falkland war against Great Britain.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Congress Confirms, Socialist Party </F> Denies Attempt on Aden Governor Life"]    [Excerpt] Sanaa, London, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Sources close  to Brigadier General Salih Munsir al-Siyayli, governor of Aden,  yesterday denied recent reports of an attempt on his life during  which he sustained serious injuries, prompting him to travel  abroad, where he was admitted to an intensive care unit.    Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] sources have said that  al-Siyayli is carrying out his duties and is available in his  residence every evening with a number of his advisers in the  governorate. Informed sources had confirmed the report about  the injury of the Aden governor, who is the strongest YSP  opponent to the General People's Congress' policy.    AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT contacted al-Siyayli's house, and one of  his aides said he was in the house holding a meeting with more  than 30 people. He said that "if he had been subjected to any  harm, the situation would have been different."    Sanaa sources linked these reports with Salih al-Siyayli's  disappearance and failure to attend the meetings held over the  past days by Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid. [passage omitted]</p>

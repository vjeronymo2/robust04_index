			<p><P> November 27, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PAY RAISES FOR STATE OFFICIALS, PAY CUTS FOR POOR  </P> <P> On Nov. 14, The Times carried an article ("Aged Poor, Disabled to Lose Benefits  Raise") that reported that the state planned to keep the $17-a-month (per  recipient) cost-of-living increase from the federal government rather than pass  it on to the aged, poor and disabled, thereby "saving" $58 million -- a small  fraction of the projected state income shortfall.  </P> <P> And what were the plans for the money saved? The answer came in a Nov. 16  article ("Raise for Governor, Legislators Endorsed"). The raises mentioned were  in the thousands per month category. This must be a government version of Robin  Hood -- take from the poor and give to the rich!  </P> <P> BOYD WINN, Los Angeles  </P></p>

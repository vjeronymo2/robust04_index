			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hindi </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Amitabh Agnihotri: "Mulayam That Was Mulayam"] </F>   [Text] On 4 January, Mr. Mulayam Singh Yadav finished one  month as the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh. In this short  period of one month, signs indicate that Mulayam Singh Yadav,  who is sitting in the chief minister's chair for the second  time, appears to be politically more intelligent this time. He  appears to be more capable of reading the sensitivity of the  political climate now. It appears that he learned from his past  mistakes and is standing on firmer ground. He has learned facts  now after his hard work.    Mulayam Singh is known for his own personal political style.  This is his asset and strength. This asset is still intact with  him. One positive indication is that the bragging that had  previously made him a victim of criticism, or the political  equations that made him unsure of himself, is decreasing now.  This is Mulayam Singh's changed image, who is cementing his  friendship with Kanshi Ram.    Mulayam Singh, who was educated in the political school of  Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia, has some special qualities which make him  important in the state politics despite all the criticism and  accusations levied against him. The new atmosphere that came  into Indian politics with Rajiv Gandhi somewhat escaped Mulayam  Singh. The fact that he had a Rajiv-supported government in the  state for some time is a separate issue. Mulayam Singh never  joined the political "suit and safari" culture. From the  beginning until now, he is still a swadeshi Mulayam Singh. He  never reduced his interests and relations with villagers,  village meetings, and farms.    These very swadeshi connections that Mulayam Singh has have  given him the self-confidence to take the great risk of jumping  into the Vidhan Sabha elections in association with Kanshi Ram's  Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP). He ignored all the threats issued by  the imams and propaganda issued by the Janata family, and  insisted on his own friendly left-wing leaders. He took the risk  of walking alone, and was successful because his feet were on  the ground in this state, and his fingers were on the pulse of  the people.    Therefore, Mulayam Singh turned a deaf ear toward them all  and continued to walk. The political pundits wrote his political  future before the election and made some forecasts. He was not  affected by them, though. He says unofficially now, "Who  believed that I would be able to form a government on my own?  The people have given their decree now, though, and all their  assumptions have failed."    Kanshi Ram has his own style. We cannot believe that Mulayam  Singh is unaware of this style. Nor is it possible that he is  not aware of Kanshi Ram's political activities. Still, the skill  he showed in keeping their coalition in order to establish  government in this state is the result of his changed attitude  and his political savvy. If we had the Mulayam Singh of the  past, then there would be a large number of people who believed  that this coalition would not be successful in forming a  government.    Kanshi Ram did not support the inclusion of his BSP in the  state government. All he wanted was to support Mulayam Singh and  to let him form the government. However, Mulayam Singh finally  convinced him, and the BSP joined the government. This happened  because he felt that it would be difficult to run a government  with the BSP outside of it and not being responsible for the  consequences.    His attitude toward Ayodhya and Dunkel is not extremist now.  Until yesterday, he carried the flag of a one-sided opinion on  both these issues. He is more in control now, though, and is  neither fighting the central government on Dunkel, nor is he a  spokesman for the mosque politics of Ayodhya. The political  balance that Mulayam Singh demonstrated on both these burning  questions at least shows that his past experience has made him  mulayam' [mellow] and serious. This change in Mulayam Singh  Yadav has occurred in several phases. He comments very carefully  on any political question that affects the Uttar Pradesh  political equation. He is becoming an expert on ignoring  specific questions in a specific style. Questions related to his  coalition party, the Bahujan Samaj Party, show his new style. He  is fully aware of the situation that helped him get the chief  minister's position in the state. He is always aware of the  importance of his friendship with Kanshi Ram. He tries his best  to ensure that he does not comment on the statement made by  Kanshi Ram, the BSP chief. Kanshi Ram's comment, "I want an  unstable government everywhere," only made Mr. Yadav smile. He  later said, "You had better ask Kanshi Ram about it." On further  questioning, he says that he said this about other places, not  about Uttar Pradesh. We are fully stable in this state, he said.  Mulayam Singh shows a lot of this type of political skill now.    He avoids making political comments because, as he said  himself, people get confused. "When people spread confusion in  the past, I stopped going to Delhi. If I come here, anyone I  talk to gets confused." Who are the people who confuse the  issue? He does not give any names. But he repeats many times  that he is fully with Kanshi Ram now.    He calls what happened in the UP Vidhan Sabha on the first  day of the session deplorable and inappropriate. Later, he tells  the whole story off the record.    He hints that there should be no cheating on examinations,  and that his government will take some important steps. In  unofficial talks, he says, "You see, no one will be able to copy  at all."    He gives some reasoning, off the record, in implementation  of  the Gunda Act. While mentioning the arrest of Chowdhery  Manmohan, Mayavati, and his own brother, Ram Pal, under this  act, he says, "Was using the Gunda Act to arrest Ram Pal legal?"  He admits that this act was abused.    The political styles of Hemvati Nandan Bahuguna and Bir  Bahadur Singh are discussed often in the state. Both these  leaders had the political asset of being able to recognize even  a minor political worker and meet him directly. Mulayam Singh is  also driving his political vehicle on this path. That is why his  party is behind him and he is leading it. What he has learned  from Lohia and Charan Singh has helped him get the chief  minister's chair now. His political history shows that whenever  and wherever he had to stay behind his party, he could not stop  himself for long.</p>

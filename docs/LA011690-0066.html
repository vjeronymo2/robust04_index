			<p><P> January 16, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NBA ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> KNICKS BEAT CLOCK AND BULLS, 109-106  </P> <P> When New York reporters covering the Knicks wrote early this season that  seven-foot Patrick Ewing had developed into the best center in the NBA, it was  greeted with some skepticism.  </P> <P> But Ewing has changed that. A disappointment early in his five-year pro career,  the Knick center has become a dominant figure in the middle, both on offense  and defense.  </P> <P> Ewing had 33 points Monday at New York, but his defensive work was more  important as the Knicks defeated the Chicago Bulls, 109-106, on a controversial  play in the final one-tenth of a second.  </P> <P> That's how much time was remaining when Mark Jackson inbounded the ball to  Trent Tucker, who turned and made a 26-foot, three-point shot.  </P> <P> "I can't believe it," Bull Coach Phil Jackson said. "There isn't time enough to  get off a shot. That was a one- or two-second shot. A tenth of a second it was  not."  </P> <P> Referee Paul Mihalik said, "It was a judgment call."  </P> <P> The strange finish did not diminish the performance of Ewing. His exceptional  play kept the Bulls from winning handily.  </P> <P> He blocked eight shots and grabbed 12 rebounds. His presence prevented Michael  Jordan from taking the ball to the basket.  </P> <P> Jordan, only nine of 24 from the field, had 26 points. His jump shot gave the  Bulls a 106-104 lead with 1:21 left. But Ewing grabbed a rebound and scored to  tie the score with 65 seconds remaining.  </P> <P> Cleveland 92, San Antonio 89 -- Mark Price does not consider himself another  Magic Johnson, but he always wanted to get a triple-double.  </P> <P> He picked a good time for his first. Facing the tough Spurs at Richfield, Ohio,  Price had 25 points, 11 rebounds and 12 assists as the Cavaliers prevailed.  </P> <P> The Spurs lost their second consecutive road game, despite 28 points, 10  rebounds and four blocked shots by David Robinson.  </P> <P> Denver 101, Dallas 90 -- Alex English scored 20 of his season-high 29 points to  help the Nuggets build a comfortable lead, but Coach Doug Moe was not happy  with his team's play at Denver.  </P> <P> "I hope we've hit rock bottom offensively, because we were terrible today," Moe  said. "We weren't active, we stood around too much and we were totally out of  sync."  </P> <P> Indiana 144, Golden State 105 -- The Warriors are as bad on the road as they  are good at home. After winning six in a row at home, they were never in this  game at Indianapolis.  </P> <P> The Pacers scored 44 points in the first quarter and led, 86-48, at halftime.  </P> <P> Miami 111, Washington 105 -- Glen Rice scored 11 of his 27 points in the fourth  quarter at Landover, Md., to lead a comeback by the Heat and end its 13-game  losing streak.  </P> <P> The Bullets were led by Bernard King with 30 points, but he was sitting on the  bench when the Heat wiped out a seven-point deficit in the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> Phoenix 118, Charlotte 108 -- Tom Chambers scored 40 points, but the Suns had  to go overtime to hand the Hornets their 15th loss on the road without a  victory.  </P> <P> The Hornets battled from a 69-52 deficit to force the overtime on a three-point  basket by Rex Chapman with 23 seconds left. In overtime, Charlotte was  outscored, 12-2.  </P> <P> Seattle 105, Houston 101 -- The SuperSonics, who have been complaining about  not getting a fair shake from referees, lost Coach Bernie Bickerstaff by  ejection early, but outlasted the Rockets at Seattle.

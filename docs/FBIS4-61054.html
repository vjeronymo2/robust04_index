			<p>BFN     [Text] The Russian foreign policy-makers are attentively  observing the situation in the Persian Gulf. Moscow wants to  contribute to a settlement of the conflict there as well as in  any other region of the world and seeks stability and friendly  relations established in the region. Moscow considers this to  be in its direct state interests, a Russian expert on this  region's problems told INTERFAX in an interview.    He suggested that the Russian position on elimination of the  consequences of the Iraqi-Kuwait conflict proceeded from the  priority of international law. "This means that Baghdad must  strictly observe and implement all the decisions made by the  world community. The UN Security Council in its turn must  adequately response to all positive moves by Iraq," he added.    The expert pointed out that three years after the armed  conflict Iraq had done much for implementation of the decisions  made by the UN Security Council, primarily in the sphere of  disarmament.    The expert said this had caused the Russian representative  to  the UN Security Council to propose at its last session that the  "work" with Iraq proceed to the next stage providing for  international control over the Iraqi military programs.    "Moscow, Paris, Beijing and several nonpermanent members of  the UN Security Council believe that such specific measures  would encourage Baghdad for further cooperation with the Special  Commission," the expert suggested.    He said Moscow was afraid that a continuing indefinite  position on lifting the sanctions and utilization of pressure  and threats in dialogue with Iraq might bring results opposite  to expectations, such as confrontation with the UN and a closed  defense policy.</p>

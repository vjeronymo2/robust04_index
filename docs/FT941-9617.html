			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / Arts: Today's Television Why do we so readily talk about 'shoplifting' when we mean theft? People who steal from shops are just as much thieves as the chaps in black masks with sacks marked 'Swag'. Even the publicity for Cutting Edge uses the silly euphemism. The programme looks at the efforts made by shops and police to hold back the rising tide of shop theft, and interviews 'Megan' who is described as 'Britain's top shoplifter', meaning Britain's worst shop thief presumably (9.00 C4). Horizon studies the way in which air crashes are investigated (9.00 BBC2). Panorama reports on asthma, a subject on which we have had a fairly recent programme (9.30 BBC1). BBC2's Picasso Season continues with Richardson On Picasso which describes the beginnings of cubist sculpture (10.00) and Picasso And The Dealers which promises to locate all 23 bronze casts of 'Head Of A Woman' (10.20). Olympic Grandstand will be showing all the greatest moments from Torvill and Dean's Olympic career (11.15 BBC2).</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 4 (AFP)--China on Wednesday dismissed  President Bill Clinton's warning that it risked losing its  most-favoured-nation (MFN) trade status with the United States  if further improvements are not made in human rights.  Commenting on Clinton's warning, issued Tuesday, a foreign  ministry spokesman suggested that the United States had just as  much to lose as China if MFN is not renewed in June and he  reiterated Beijing's opposition to the linkage of MFN with human  rights.    "The Chinese government has repeatedly and clearly stated  that the mutual offer of MFN status between the United States  and China is a reciprocal and mutually beneficial arrangement,"  the spokesman said. "MFN status should not be linked to other  issues irrelevant to it. This position remains unchanged," he  added.    Clinton said Tuesday that while he had no wish to withdraw  China's MFN, Beijing had yet to make the "significant progress"  demanded by his executive order in some areas of human rights.  Asked if China's MFN status was in serious jeopardy, the  president replied. "Yes, it is a possibility."    Clinton must make a decision on MFN renewal by June 3.    The MFN issue has dominated Sino-U.S. relations for the past  year, and ties have been further strained by bitter disputes  over textile quotas, U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, and alleged  Chinese sales of missile technology to Pakistan.    At the same time, however, economic and trade ties have  strengthened considerably, with the American business community,  which is firmly opposed to the withdrawal of China's MFN,  investing heavily in what is now the fastest growing economy in  the world.    MFN status entitles imports to be brought into the United  States at low or zero customs rates. In China's case, the status  is worth hundreds of millions of dollars.    The U.S. trade deficit with China soared 25 percent last  year  to a record 22.8 billion dollars, an independent U.S. agency,  the International Trade Commission (ITC), said Tuesday.    The deficit has risen steadily in the past three years, from  12.6 billion dollars in 1991 to 18.2 billion in 1992 and 22.8  billion in 1993, the ITC said.</p>

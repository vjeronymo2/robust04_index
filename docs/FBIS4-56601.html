			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on developments related to the Panamanian elections  scheduled for 8 May 1994.    Mireya Moscoso de Gruber, presidential candidate for the  Arnulfist Party (PA), said on 26 April that the constitutional  articles on the creation and functions of the defunct Panama  Defense Forces must be amended. De Gruber visited Betania  Corregimiento on the morning of 26 April and stated: "When the  president tried to reform the Constitution, various legislators  erroneously tried to modify several articles. That is why the  Panamanian people rejected the constitutional reforms." (Panama  City Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 26 Apr 94)    Ruben Blades, presidential candidate of the Papa Egoro  Movement, MPE, said that the polls indicate he is tied for first  place with Democratic Revolutionary Party, PRD, candidate  Ernesto Perez Balladares. Regarding support for him in the  interior, Blades stated: "I think we have more support in the  interior than is reflected in the polls." MPE slate members  said as part of their government program that no public  employees will be dismissed. (Panama City Circuito RPC  Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 28 Apr 94)    Government Minister Jacobo Salas said that the president  guaranteed that the 8 May elections will be free. Salas  explained that "violence will not be tolerated, regardless of  where it comes from." Regarding the decree banning weapons  sales, Salas said it will remain in effect until 31 March. The  minister stressed that "it is the president's desire to hold  free elections in which violence -- we are confident there will  not be any violence -- must be repressed, regardless of where it  originates."

Some 52 taxi drivers'  organizations in Panama Province met in a Panama City hotel to  endorse the candidacy of PA presidential candidate Mireya  Moscoso de Gruber. The transportation workers delivered Mrs. De  Gruber a list of proposals to modify Law 14 regulating  transportation. De Gruber promised to meet the transportation  workers' requests and said: "When we are at the presidency, you  will have a friend more than a president. You will advise me on  how my government can work better for all of you." (Panama City  Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 29 Apr 94)    On the evening of 3 May, PRD presidential candidate Ernesto  Perez Balladares met with farmers from Chiriqui Province in  Boquete. Perez Balladares addressed farmers on the need to  improve roads in production areas, erroneous government  agricultural policy, and falling coffee prices. He told  producers he will establish "adequate protection for the  agricultural sector for crops such as potatoes, rice, beans,  corn, and sorghum."

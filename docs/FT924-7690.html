			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Finance and the Family: Houses are cheap, but are they good value? - A look at property returns MAKE NO mistake about it, houses in the UK are currently cheap by recent standards. A difficult question is whether they will get cheaper still. An analysis of housing affordability by the Weekend FT shows that following Thursday's base rate cut, houses are cheaper to buy than at any time since 1971 - before the notion of a 'property-owning democracy' took hold. How has this been measured? The usual crude definition is to take average house prices relative to average earnings. But this tells nothing about the true cost of buying a house, which is shown by mortgage interest payments. These vary with the level of interest rates. The graph uses a subtle definition of affordability adapted from the Building Societies Association, which divides average monthly earnings by the amount needed to finance an 80 per cent mortgage for the average-priced house at prevailing interest rates. All prevailing tax reliefs have been taken into account. The boom of the late 1980s can clearly be seen as an aberration. During the 1950s and 1960s, housing affordability was almost constant - financing a house accounted for around 8 per cent of gross earnings on average (although bear in mind that income tax then stood at 42.5 per cent). Those feeling euphoric about mortgage rates of 8.5 per cent (effectively 7.2 per cent after tax relief for our typical borrower) might note that the net mortgage rate in 1956, when there was no limit on mortgage interest tax relief, was 3.06 per cent. It did not rise above 5 per cent until 1970. Reductions in tax relief, coupled with increasing base rates, have levered up effective mortgage rates. In 1990, they combined with high house prices to make the average mortgage bill account for 45.1 per cent of average gross earnings, on the FT's assumptions. That was significantly more than half of take-home pay. Assuming a current pre-tax mortgage rate of 8.5 per cent, houses now cost only 19.4 per cent of average earnings - the lowest figure since 1971. The bad news is that it will be difficult to make houses any cheaper without more cuts in nominal prices as the base rate cuts are coming to a halt - building societies believe that 6 per cent is the lowest base rates can be expected to go. So the time seems right, on all historical criteria, to buy a house. Would it be a good investment? Perhaps not. As we have seen, house prices have kept dropping, despite big improvements in affordability. People were still rushing to buy houses when base rates were put up to 15 per cent in October 1989. But the Halifax Building Society recorded successive monthly house price falls of 3.1 per cent and 1.2 per cent in September and October this year, in spite of the reductions in base rates. Three key factors have been identified as distinguishing this housing recession from the previous downturns and forcing price reductions: Uncertainty: Fears about the general economy and jobs have made many people nervous about buying a house. Negative equity: Real house prices fell in the mid-1970s without any fall in nominal prices because inflation was so high. In the last few years, low inflation meant that nominal prices had to drop. This led to 'negative equity' - where the value of a home is less than the outstanding loan secured on it, making it impossible, using usual lending criteria, to move house. This has artificially constricted demand, forcing prices down further. Repossessions: Houses grew so expensive, just as people were losing their jobs, that the level of forced repossessions of houses by lenders is at an all-time high. Once a house has been repossessed it has to be sold, thus creating extra supply - another force towards lower house prices. The measures in the Autumn Statement are aimed at precisely these problems. Will they work? In theory, the sudden appearance of Pounds 750m buying 20,000 empty properties cannot fail to stimulate the market and cut into the problem of over-supply. Uncertainty should also be helped. The measures have been broadly welcomed by building societies. But John Wriglesworth, building society analyst at UBS Phillips and Drew, does not think the measures are enough to prevent a fall in property prices of 'at least' 5 per cent next year. He attributes this to oversupply and the 'fear' factor - people who can afford to buy are holding back because of fears of unemployment and further house price falls. If he is right, then it must pay to wait even longer. But most analysts now see prices stabilising. David Goldsworthy, president elect of the National Association of Estate Agents, welcomed the moves, saying: 'If we can take repossessions off the market, then first-time buyers will be buying houses from people wanting to go up the housing ladder.' The slide in interest rates is making the return on cash-based savings unattractive, so should people with Pounds 100,000 to spare be thinking about buying property as a long-term investment in the hope of outperforming equities? The chart below compares the performance of the FT-All Share (without income re-invested) with that of property prices, both in real terms since the end of 1970. During that period, houses outperformed equities  - but the outcome would differ depending on the timing. The return on equities has been greater than on private property over the period from 1973 to date. But if you take 1962, when the FT-All Share index was first compiled, as your base date, property has done better. If you had bought a house then, it would now be worth double the amount you paid for it in real terms, compared with a 22.4 per cent real increase in equities since then. But if you had bought shares after the stock market crash of 1974, your money would have increased almost four-fold today, compared with a return of only 6.6 per cent on property, in spite of the property crash of 1973-74. These examples, and the smoother real house price curve on the graph, show one great advantage for property investors - house prices are far less volatile than equities. 'The utility value of housing keeps their prices rising with income so you should not lose money but it will not necessarily be the best performing investment,' said Wriglesworth. 'But property can be a useful part of a diversified portfolio.' The case for some recovery in house prices looks strong. But it may take time for the fundamental factors to outweigh the lack of confidence of potential homebuyers and the negative equity trap.</p>

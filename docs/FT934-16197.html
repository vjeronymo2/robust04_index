			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / International Company News: France closes sale of BNP shares to institutions THE FRENCH government last night closed the sale of shares to institutional investors in Banque Nationale de Paris, the first company to be sold in its privatisation drive, because the tranche was already more than 12 times subscribed. The economy ministry said that the 'strength and speed' of the institutions' response to the issue had forced it to bring that part of BNP's privatisation to an early close. The original deadline for institutional subscriptions was October 12, the same as for the public offer. The ministry has no plans to close the public part of the BNP sale, which values the bank, headed by Mr Michel Pebereau, at FFr43bn (Dollars 7.6bn) by selling its shares at FFr240 each. The ministry declined to comment on the level of subscriptions received so far from individual investors. However, banking sources suggest that public demand for shares in BNP has also been high. French and foreign institutions subscribed for around FFr100bn of BNP shares in the first two days of the offer, against the FFr8.3bn of equity that had been allocated to them. Under the original offer terms the government reserved 12.12m shares, or 17 per cent of the total issue, for French institutions and 22.5m shares, or 31 per cent, for foreign institutions. However, the number of shares available to institutions could be reduced by up to 9.5m if demand from individual investors is so strong that the government decides to trigger its clawback facility. The success of the BNP share sale is critical to the prospects for the rest of the centre-right French government's privatisation programme. This could include the sale of up to 21 companies, including the Rhone-Poulenc chemicals company and Elf-Aquitaine oil group. Analysts have interpreted the keen pricing of BNP's shares as a tactical ploy to ensure that the issue was a success. The eventual share price of FFr240 was significantly lower than the stock market's initial estimates of between FFr250 and FFr275.</p>

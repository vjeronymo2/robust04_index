			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / Retail spending surge predicted Retail spending will rise 12.1 per cent in real terms in the next five years compared with 4.8 per cent between 1988 and 1993, says Verdict, the retail research group. It says demand will still be weak although spending growth will be faster. That means inflation is unlikely to exceed 3 per cent. Verdict says that significant demographic changes will be important for retailers and consumer goods producers. Older consumers with low housing costs in relation to their incomes will rise in number and will have more disposable income. Verdict says the number of consumers aged 30 to 40 will rise by almost 800,000, boosting sales of household goods, DIY products and children's wear. But unemployment among the young will continue to depress fashion and music. Verdict expects the fastest-growing products to be in consumer electronics, where innovation and falling prices will stimulate demand. New audio and television products are expected to show rapid growth. Retail Demand 1998. Verdict, 112 High Holborn, London WC1V 6JS. Pounds 950.</p>

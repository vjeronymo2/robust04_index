			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, June 23 (BTA) -- The cabinet today increased  the prices of both imported and local solid fuel by a decree  envisaging measures for the stabilization of the energy sector.  Briquettes will cost 1,250 leva/tonne (about $22 at the current  exchange rate), up from 660 leva/tonne, until October 1, when  price ceilings will be introduced for solid fuels.    Other prices were fixed as follows: brown coal from 995 to  1,116 leva/tonne; cleaned brown coal from 1,312 to 1,318  leva/tonne; and lignite coal 632 to 809 leva/tonne.    The decree sets maximum mercantile additions for local coal  at 210 leva/tonne; local briquettes 150 leva/tonne, and imported  coal and briquettes 210 leva/tonne.    It was agreed that value added tax [VAT], introduced on  April  1, should not apply to fixed prices, Nikita Shervashidze,  chairman of the Power Engineering Committee, said after the  government meeting. That is why the government will allocate  2,038 million leva to compensate the electricity supply industry  for losses resulting from the imposition of VAT. In his view,  this financial support is designed to tide the energy sector  over until the introduction of prices and rate schedules that  will allow it to become self-supporting. Power engineering  companies estimate their losses at 2,000 million leva, while  other sectors owe the energy sector some 14,000 million leva,  according to statistics of the Power Engineering Committee.    Heating prices for industrial consumption were also  increased. Suppliers can fix prices according to their  production costs.    The decree envisages sanctions against managers of  enterprises that are behind with their payments. They must pay  their electricity and gas bills before wages are paid to  employees. Those breaking the regulations will be fined up to  10,000 leva.    No agreement was reached with the Finance Ministry on the  enforcement of Council of Ministers' Decree No. 77, under which  payments to the exchequer must precede the payment of wages.  The finance minister and the chairman of the Power Engineering  Committee were assigned to find mutually acceptable solutions.  The introduction of new pricing methods in power engineering is  the key to a lasting solution to its problems. Such a  methodology has been drawn up and will be submitted to the  government for approval. Shervashidze declined to cite new fuel  and electricity prices. He said they would be formed along  market economy principles, depending on the economic situation  and the dollar exchange rate, but mechanisms to cushion the  effect on low-income groups would also be introduced.</p>

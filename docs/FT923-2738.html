			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Scholes blames low activity for 31% fall to Pounds 3.17m SCHOLES, the electrical installation materials group, continued to be affected by 'the worst recession for many years', and reported a 31 per cent fall in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 4.58m to Pounds 3.17m, for the 12 months to June 30. Turnover declined 8 per cent to Pounds 62m (Pounds 67.3m). Mr Bill Riches, who moved up from finance director to chairman in July after the death in March of Mr Reg Harrington, the previous chairman and chief executive, said lower levels of activity lay behind the profits fall. The group's cash position was sharply improved, he said. Net cash generation rose to Pounds 4.4m (Pounds 1.5m) and gearing fell to 13 per cent (32 per cent) as borrowings were cut to Pounds 3m (Pounds 7.4m). Net interest charges were almost halved at Pounds 834,000 (Pounds 1.59m), ameliorating the 47 per cent decline in operating profits from Pounds 7.12m to Pounds 3.8m. The group, Mr Riches said, had a much better second half - turnover was Pounds 33.5m, operating profits Pounds 2.6m and pre-tax profits Pounds 2.3m. The respective first-half figures were Pounds 29.5m, Pounds 1.2m and Pounds 916,000. The improvement, he said, was largely a result of reduced costs and manufacturing efficiencies, and to a lesser extent to increased sales volume. Mr Riches also said that the restructured board would be exerting more hands-on management as far as pricing, joint ventures and product development were concerned. There were no acquisitions in the pipeline, but capital expenditure, having fallen in the year under review from Pounds 2m to Pounds 1.5m, would rise to Pounds 2.5m or more in the current year. Earnings were down at 5.9p (8.5p) per share, from which a maintained 5p total dividend will be paid via an unchanged 3.4p final. COMMENT The results were a little better than expected, especially the second half, though trading is locked into the housing and construction market doldrums. However, Scholes can only benefit from its growing joint venture relationship with Asea Brown Boveri (cf Delta and AEG). ABB does the expensive research and development chores and Scholes makes and distributes the products well. Meanwhile Mr Alan Baxter, the chief executive newly arrived from FKI, adds muscle to a board which needs to regain some control of the operating companies from their managements. Forecasts for current full-year pre-tax profits give a multiple of 9.7. The shares - up 1p at 93p  -might well drift for a while, but any positive interest rate news to help the housing market will give them a boost. Worth buying and holding.</p>

The temporary office of the embassy, which was officially  established on Dec. 6 last year, is at the Kuala Lumpur Hilton,  here. It is headed by Charge d'Affaires Henri S. Gaubenheimer.    Second Secretary (Administration) Andre Lizamore told  BERNAMA  Saturday the embassy was in the process of identifying  appropriate premises for the chancery and official residence and  hoped to move into the new buildings in April.    Meanwhile, Third Secretary and Deputy Head of the South  African Mission to Malaysia, Jan Groenewald, said in a statement  that with the establishment of the embassy here matters  pertaining to relations between South Africa and Malaysia would  no longer be dealt with by the South African Embassy in  Singapore. Groenewald was the officer at the embassy in  Singapore dealing with Malaysia. He will move to Kuala Lumpur  on March 1.</p>

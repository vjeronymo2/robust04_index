			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Observer: The hand that feeds Under-capitalised small businessmen would doubtless have little sympathy with the plight of 26-year-old Richard Li, who cannot quite decide how best to deploy the tidy Dollars 400m that has just landed in his bank account. Half the cash has come his way following the sale of a stake in Hong Kong-based satellite broadcaster Star TV to Rupert Murdoch, while his father, Li Ka-shing, one of the colony's leading businessmen, was so proud of his offspring's handling of the deal that he made it up to a round Dollars 400m from the family coffers. But Li is engagingly vague as to how he intends to spend his largesse. 'I'm in the position of having a completely blank sheet of paper,' he confesses, adding that he rather fancies bringing 'existing state-of-the-art technology to virgin markets in Asia.' Not that that rules out investment in 'conservative businesses' such as property and infrastructure, he goes on. But how about his recent elevation to the position of deputy chairman of Hutchison Whampoa, the colony's oldest company? Might there not be, even in broad-minded Hong Kong, well, a slight conflict of interest? Describing the Hutchison job as a 'family obligation', which at this stage does not absorb all his energies, he insists that, should any minority shareholder express such concerns, he would naturally consider stepping aside. Li reckons his new venture will take six to eight months to establish and he even fights shy of divulging a name. But at least there are no immediate staffing problems; 70 of his former Star colleagues are apparently poised to follow the pied piper.</p>

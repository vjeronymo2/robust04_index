			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Berlusconi warns of pensions sacrifices All Italians will have to make sacrifices if Italy's state pension system is to avoid bankruptcy, Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister, warned yesterday. Italian trade unions have been threatening a 'hot autumn' of strikes and protests against pensions reform, the central plank of a 1995 budget which must raise or save at least L45,000bn (Pounds 18.5bn) to bring down the deficit. Mr Berlusconi, who yesterday chaired the first cabinet meeting since the summer holiday, told journalists the government would seek a dialogue with the unions. 'Unfortunately (the measures) will be unpopular,' he said, but as things stand at the moment, there is no alternative to a change in the pensions system.' He added: 'Accumulated (pensions) rights will not be touched, but we have to restructure this area to avoid the state going bankrupt and not being able to pay pensions.' Having weathered a political storm before the holidays, Mr Berlusconi clearly intended yesterday's press conference in Rome to dispel any lingering doubts, in political or financial circles, about the coalition's coherence and its determ - ination to take decisive action during the autumn. The 1995 budget was not on the formal agenda of yesterday's cabinet meeting. But the prime minister promised that a detailed budget plan would be presented to the Italian parliament well before the deadline of September 30, and that 'for the first time, it will meet requirements not by increasing taxes but by reducing public spending'. Mr Berlusconi was also obliged to declare his personal confidence in the governor of the Bank of Italy, Mr Antonio Fazio, following a series of attacks on the central bank by members of the National Alliance, the far-right partner in the ruling coalition. He said he could not understand how anyone could doubt the government's willingness to respect the bank's independence, and dismissed the comments of National Alliance politicians as 'personal opinions'. Mr Berlusconi also urged the media to concentrate on 'concrete facts instead of idle chatter'. To underpin his message, the prime minister cited an opinion poll, to be published at the weekend, which indicates that support for the ruling coalition has increased from 48.4 per cent at the height of pre-summer crisis, to 53.8 per cent.</p>

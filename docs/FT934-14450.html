			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading THE SUDDEN turn towards optimism in UK equities, backed up by renewed demand from US funds, brought sharply increased turnover in London derivatives markets yesterday, writes Terry Byland. In stock index futures, the December contract on the FT-SE Index raced to a new trading high of 3,163 at mid-session when it stood at a 40 point premium to cash. Volume jumped to 14,230 contracts, nearly 50 per cent above recent averages. The premium remained at 30 points at the close, and the session was featured by heavy arbitrage activity between futures and cash. Fair value, the premium allowing for dividend and carrying costs, stood at around 22 points yesterday but falls to around 18 on Monday when the new equity market account opens. Confidence on other European bourses that interest rates are moving lower, saw European and US funds active. Volume in traded options also soared, and 52,462 contracts were recorded, with the FT-SE contract more than doubling to 28,106.</p>

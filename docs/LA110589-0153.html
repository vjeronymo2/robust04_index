			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO ST. ROMPS PAST NEW MEXICO  </P> <P> Curtis Butts rushed for 156 yards and three touchdowns as San Diego State beat  New Mexico 45-28 Saturday night, spoiling Terance Mathis' Western Athletic  Conference record of 358 all-purpose yards.  </P> <P> Mathis, who became the NCAA career leader in receiving yardage in his previous  game, had six receptions for 147 yards to increase his record to 3,919 yards.  </P> <P> San Diego State (5-3-1 overall and 3-2 in the WAC), which led 38-28 at  halftime, maintained the lead through a scoreless third quarter and then sealed  its fourth consecutive victory on Butts' 15-yard touchdown run in the fourth.  </P> <P> That score was set up when John Wesselman forced a fumble inside the San Diego  State 5 as Derek Coffman of New Mexico (1-9, 0-6) neared the end of what would  have been a 76-yard touchdown run.  </P></p>

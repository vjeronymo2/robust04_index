			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Beware the sickly Russian bear: Should the west spoon-feed its old adversary; should it 'cuddle up to Yeltsin'? Or should it treat Russia as a serious country with its own serious national interests? A surprising question confronts the western powers. Should they fear Russia? The west, it seems, has come to believe that Russia is no longer a menace - after Mikhail Gorbachev opened it up and Boris Yeltsin introduced democracy. Rocky, volatile, impoverished, it may be, but not dangerous; no longer an adversary. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, western politicians have been asking how to use aid to encourage Russia to be friendly, democratic and market-orientated. However, in the US the debate has moved to an older question: whether the Russian bear, reborn after communism, should be feared as much as tamed. The elections in December did most to re-open the question. The party which achieved by far the largest number of votes in the State Duma was Vladimir Zhirinovsky's Liberal Democrats, who believe that Russia should at least re-conquer the space formerly occupied by the Soviet Union. Alexei Mitrofanov, 'shadow foreign minister' for the LDP, says that 'we consider the ex-Soviet republics as integral parts of Russia, and our idea is to restore them to the previous (Russian imperial) status. Not separate countries - and not even something like the Soviet republics. There will be for example no Ukraine - but provinces, as Kiev province, Donetsk province and so on - only local administration, all connected to Moscow.' The oddly named Liberal Democrats are not the only Russians to hold such view. The powerful Russian Communist party and many other groups inside and outside the parliament have also founded their popular appeal on the aggressive reassertion of Russian power in the 'near abroad' - the revealing appellation for the former Soviet states. They are the inheritors of a massive wave of popular revulsion against the arrogance of the west, the impoverishment of Russia and, most of all, the sudden estrangement of more than 25m Russians living in the 'near abroad' from a shrunken motherland. They are prey to theories of conspiratorial domination and control whose defining points can appear to be plausibly anchored in reality. Alexander Prokhanov, whose weekly 'DEN' was the bible of the nationalist movements and which has appeared again in a new guise after being banned, is the most talented of these theorists. He says: 'It's quite simple. The US is exercising its dictatorship over the domestic and foreign policies of Russia, over her cultural and ideological policies. So Russia's foreign policy in all regions of the world must match the national interests of the US in these regions. 'America's policy towards the geopolitical space known as the Soviet Union amounted to seeking its dismemberment and undermining Russia's potential, then keeping this potential at a safe level for America. In these aims (President Boris) Yeltsin and (Foreign Minister Andrei) Kozyrev have been accomplices.' These are not the voices of executive power in Moscow, but they are the voices of influence and of a powerful strand of popular protest. Both before the December elections and more obviously after, the executive power has shifted to accommodate the nationalist revival. Kozyrev has moved furthest: from the too-uncritical westerniser he was when he came to office at the end of 1991, he has become a nationalist statesman. He is not afraid of out-flanking Zhirinovsky on the need to keep the Kaliningrad enclave Russian. He has been threatening on Ukraine and has allowed it to be thought he wanted Russian troops to remain in the Baltics indefinitely. In more considered public voice, an article he wrote a week ago in the daily Izvestiya underscored that 'Russia is doomed to be a great power' with interests which conflicted with those of the west - but that these conflicts could be managed peacefully as conflicts between friendly states everywhere. The devils lie in the details of what it means to be a great power. For Andrannik Migranyan, one of President Yeltsin's most publicly visible advisors, Russia 'is a big power, economically stronger than any of its former republics'. In relation to the 'near abroad', he points out that Russia has a very serious interest: the Russians living outside the Federation; it needs accesses and routes to the Baltic and other seas through former republics; it needs to ensure security. 'All of these factors demand that Russia become a core for the reintegration of this space. Without this (reintegration) we can get many clashes, fights and wars - and we already have them.' Thus Migranyan suggests at the pressure Russia can bring to bear on the surrounding countries now struggling to establish viable statehoods. Economically, Russia dominates all but the lucky few which have substantial resources, such as Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan. It has proposed a rouble zone to bind together again states whose links remain strong: but as the squeeze upon economies gets tighter, the criteria for entry also become tighter. Last week, the governor of the Central Bank of Belarus - the Slav state which has sued for an economic union with Russia once more - said that Russia wanted complete submission to central economic and financial policy. Belarus is so prostrate and so politically inert that Russia may get it. If so, it will be a template for other economies - and the prize would be Ukraine, whose economy is in full collapse. Militarily, Russia has bases in every one of the former Soviet states except Lithuania and Azerbaijan (and it is likely to get its bases back in the latter before long). Armies have 'kept the peace' in Georgia, Armenia, Moldova and Tajikistan - sometimes using, as Sergei Karaganov, a presidential advisor on foreign policy, wrily admits, 'nineteenth century methods'. In Georgia, the Russian army was decisive in first destabilising, then (when he had come to heel) underpinning, the position of Eduard Shevardnadze, the head of state; in Tajikistan, the regime would fall without it; in Moldova, the 14th army's presence protects the interests of the majority Russian speakers on the left bank of the River Dnestr and effectively divides the country into two. Especially in Moldova and Georgia, where Yeltsin gave assurances which the army later ignored, it seems as though the army is conducting its own foreign policy. Politically, the great wave of nationalism which swept through the Soviet Union between 1989 and 1992 has all but exhausted itself - except in Russia. Non-Russian nationalism in the other republics was also anti-Russian nationalism. So the Russian democrats were unable to cement alliances with nationalists in those other republics. Nationalism is now replaced with exhaustion in many states (the Baltics are an exception: they remain strongly independent and in the case of Latvia and Estonia, strongly anti-Russian). The support for nationalist politicians has declined everywhere, including in Ukraine. The new state elites have been unable, some unwilling, to develop the attributes of statehood. There is some force to the comment of Sergei Stankevich, one of the leaders of the centrist Party of Reconciliation and Accord, that 'it is their choice to come to us, not ours. We simply open our doors to our neighbours: you cannot interpret this as imperial behaviour'. But that is precisely how an increasingly influential swathe of western elite opinion is interpreting it. Henry Kissinger, the former US Secretary of State in articles and speeches; former National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski in a widely quoted article published in Foreign Affairs; the influential columnist William Safire; the former head of the US National Security Agency General William Odom - all of these are actively propagandising against (as they represent it) a US-led, western policy of putting Russia first, cuddling up to Yeltsin, letting down the East Europeans and other former Soviets, and pretending there is a partnership. In New York, Dr Kissinger says: 'We are dealing with Russia not as though it were a serious country with its own serious national interests, but as some kind of mental basket case that we have to massage, that we have to be very careful to manoeuvre step by step into some vague relationship of 'friendship' with the west. 'Russia is acting in the traditional Russian manner, which has always had the element of dominating the erstwhile republics of the former Soviet Union. From that point of view, it is imperialist.' The cause around which those who oppose the policy of the west have gathered is that of the expansion of Nato. Under the 'Partnership for Peace' proposal put forward by President Bill Clinton in Brussels in January, all the former Communist states would be eligible to participate in the Partnership at whatever level suited them. For the Poles, the Balts, the Czechs and the Hungarians, it was a slap in the face - a clear indication that the west favoured Russian interests over theirs. They have powerful allies in the west, among them Mr Brzezinski. In Washington, he said: 'I think that if we were to expand Nato eastwards and Nato were to offer Russia a treaty of alliance; if we were to balance aid to Russia with more aid for the non-Russian states, we might succeed in creating a geo-political context that would be relatively stable and would mitigate some of the dangers (of Russian expansionism). This would help the Russian democrats by bringing the west closer to Russia; if we don't do it now, when would we do it? Is a political vaccuum in the heart of Europe in the interests of Russia?' This potentially damaging attack has drawn blood, and a response. On Monday, the US Defence Secretary William Perry took on Kissinger, Brzezinski and others when he said the current policy included views of Russia both as a rival and a partner. This was 'lost on our critics of constructive engagement. They say we have chosen to make Russia a partner when we should be making them a rival. And I say that is a false dichotomy.' The debate can only be inconclusive: for it depends on factors which are unknowable. Migranyan, the presidential advisor, believes Russia is 'in no sense a democracy: it is passing through a time of authoritarianism from which it might emerge into a democracy'. Professor Peter Reddaway of the US Institute for Peace, one of the most consistently pessimistic of the prominent commentators on Russia, points to the criminalisation of the economy and warns of a turning away from reform. It is certain that we are facing a country which will remain an enigma - if no longer enclosed in a dogma. It is undergoing a loss of empire of the kind Britain and France sustained in the 20th century, with an adoption of democracy which took most of the western states centuries to achieve, plus an opening to markets for which the culture was wholly unprepared. It should not be forgotten how intense this process is.

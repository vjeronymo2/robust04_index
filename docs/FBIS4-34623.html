			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on an interview with Venezuelan Interior Minister </F> Ramon Escovar Salom by an unidentified reporter at the  Presidential Palace in Caracas on 16 June]    [Text] Upon leaving the Council of Minister's meeting  yesterday, Interior Minister Ramon Escovar Salom said that what  we have in the country right now are rumors, rumors, and more  rumors.    [EL NACIONAL] The Defense Ministry said it has information.    [Escovar] The Interior Ministry has plenty of information,  but I have nothing to disclose at this time.    [EL NACIONAL] Do you fear public disorder due to the bank  interventions?    [Escovar] Let's wait and see how things unfold. So far we  have reports of only small incidents, of which you are all  aware. Right now--it is a little past 1400--I know of no  demonstrations in Caracas or anywhere else in the country. There  has been gossip on the street here and there, but nothing to be  concerned about. There are, however, many rumors. There is a  rumor factory.    [EL NACIONAL] Coming from whom?    [Escovar] The rumors come from groups which have an interest  in spreading them. I have said I will make a statement on that  particular issue and I will, but not at this time. [end Escovar]    Referring to the decree issued by former President Carlos  Andres Perez granting Venezuelan citizenship to the children of  illegal aliens, the minister stated:    [Escovar] The decree that is in effect is one of the most  important documents handed down by former President Velasquez.  Decree 1,911, issued by President Perez, was an irresponsible  act against Venezuela of historic proportions because it granted  more privileges to illegal aliens that Venezuelans have  themselves. When I was prosecutor general, I opposed the decree  right from the start. I have no doubt whatsoever that the  Supreme Court of Justice will revoke the decree. When the time  comes for the Supreme Court to make its decision, the prosecutor  general will present his case with the arguments he deems best  at the appropriate time.    [EL NACIONAL] Do you believe there are sufficient arguments  to sustain his case?    [Escovar] Of course, more than enough.    [EL NACIONAL] Will you participate?    [Escovar] No, I will not participate because that is no  longer within my realm of responsibility. President Velasquez's  position was supported by 80 percent of the Venezuelan people,  and President Perez's position was rejected by 80 percent. [end  Escovar]    Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli Rivas spoke of the  recently concluded fourth Ibero-American conference in Cartagena  (Colombia), which was attended by President Rafael Caldera.    The discussion included integration, trade, and development,  but from the beginning it was obvious that politics would, in a  casuistical manner, be worked into the agenda, as is the case  with Cuba.    [EL NACIONAL] What did you think of Fidel Castro's  statements?    [Escovar] First I would say that Castro's speech, his formal  speech at the inauguration, was an age-old speech that predated  the end of the Cold War. It was a memorandum of offenses, of the  embargo, and against the United States. More important, however,  was what happened next: First President Caldera, and then  several other presidents, invited Castro to join the  inter-American system from the political and legal viewpoint. In  other words, he was asked to accept the rules of the game of a  community such as that which exists in this hemisphere; that is,  rules based on democracy and human rights.    As for the achievements (?) of the Castro regime, Burelli  Rivas said: My opinion is like that of any individual who has  the democratic conviction that there is no substitute for  freedom and that social development is not incompatible with the  exercise of freedom.    [EL NACIONAL] What about his statement that he will hold  elections in Cuba when Cuba is integrated into Latin America?    [Escovar] When he was asked to have changes made in Cuba  with  him instead of against him, his final statement was, in essence,  what had been suggested to him. He asked to be allowed to join  this community whenever there is a broad Latin American  integration. Well, Latin American integration is moving quickly  through various channels, and now we are trying to unify all our  projects.    One of the states at the summit offered to host the  unification meeting, organize all the integration projects, and  expedite efforts for our countries to join NAFTA and the EU  earlier than scheduled, which, of course, is not this afternoon  or tomorrow.    [EL NACIONAL] Who suggested that?    [Escovar] The president of Paraguay offered Asuncion as host  city for a unification conference to discuss various projects  that are in progress and should be consolidated. I think the OAS  could do a lot in that sense as well. It could serve as the  focal point for all integration plans that are currently spread  out and which seek the same goal.    [EL NACIONAL] Is it true that the Cuban president was  invited  to Venezuela?    [Escovar] No, it is not true.</p>

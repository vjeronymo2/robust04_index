			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / Survey of Mexico (5): A degree of scepticism - A look at radical reform plans for the PRI - the Institutional Revolutionary Party 'As president of all Mexicans, I am determined not to interfere, in any way at all, in the process of selection of candidates of the PRI, of all types, from municipal presidents to presidents of the republic.' With these words, Mr Ernesto Zedillo proclaimed his intention to push for the most radical reform of the Institutional Revolutionary Party since its foundation 65 years ago. The reform, in theory, would make the PRI independent of the president and the government of the day. It would remove the president's power to pick PRI candidates for elective office (the so-called dedazo) and require the PRI to finance itself independently of the government. The pressure for change comes from both within and outside the PRI. Opposition parties and many observers contest that the reform of the PRI is indispensable for democratic change in the country. Within the PRI, many officials grudgingly accept that reform is necessary for the legitimisation of the political system; others, frustrated by presidential control of their party, want a greater say in shaping government policy and in picking candidates. Nevertheless, there is some scepticism that the internal reforms will be implemented as described. Stiff opposition to financial reform is likely to come from those who depend on the party for a living, and from those who fear that the PRI will find it more difficult to win elections when competing on a level playing field with the opposition. Mr Zedillo himself may reconsider his pledge not to interfere in the affairs of the party if the PRI picks candidates opposed to his policies, or if the party tears itself apart as different factions fight over the best posts. Many observers recall that President Salinas quickly dropped his commitment to have internal primaries after his favoured candidate for the governor of the state of Colima was defeated in a primary by a local notary. But while a retreat is possible, the timetable for reform has been set, and a reversal would be politically costly. PRI leaders have agreed to hold a National Assembly by the middle of next year, which is intended to put into statute books any reforms agreed on. Mr Jesus Reyes Heroles, the PRI official in charge of internal reform, says without hesitation that most of the changes will be implemented in time for the 1997 Congressional elections. In a sign of its seriousness about reform, the PRI has in fact already changed the way it selects its candidates. The candidate for governor of Jalisco was to be chosen in a secret ballot of around 2,000 delegates in a convention; in preceding weeks, the PRI picked candidates for local elections in the states of Tlaxcala, San Luis Potosi and Guanajuato through primaries or conventions. Party officials describe the results so far as a big success. The danger remains that conventions or primaries will be dominated by old-style local party bosses, who will (legitimately or not) be able to ensure the election of their own supporters to important posts. Officials say they will seek to prevent the manipulation of the selection process by screening out - at the national level - any undesirable candidates and by setting up a commission to oversee internal elections, but even they accept such precautions may not be enough. Instead, many PRI officials say the process will only work in the long run if the structure of the party is changed so that grass roots activists are given more power; and union, peasant and local political leaders, less - 'the way to solve the problem of (dominant local leaders) is to increase the presence of the territorial sector of the party,' says one official. Such a process will likely be opposed by traditional corporatist sectors, creating conditions for a possible showdown. The reform of the finances of the party may meet even more resistance, with many faring that a radical reduction in the PRI's financial resources will threaten its long-term hold on power. Perhaps for this reason, Mr Zedillo has been much more vague on details of financial reform than on the change in the way of selecting candidates. No-one knows for sure what the annual running expenses of the party are  - but in all 32 states there are scores of PRI offices, and hundreds if not thousands of PRI employers. Mr Reyes Heroles says the payroll has been cut by 70 per cent since the election; but he hints that such reductions only touch the surface of what needs to be done. The opposition has small fraction of such resources at its disposal. Mr Santiago Creel, the most prominent citizen magistrate of the Federal Electoral Institute, suggests that one way to separate the PRI and the government would be to give the opposition control of the Congressional Committee that scrutinises public finances, of the office of the Comptroller-General, and to require continuous auditing of the finances of all political parties. The PRI has yet to respond to such an initiative; but if it is serious about reform, these measures and others may be necessary.</p>

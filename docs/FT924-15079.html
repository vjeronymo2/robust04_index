			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / Major weathers blistering attack over Maastricht: Tebbit speech threatens party unity - Hurd heads off Euro-sceptics MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday scraped over the first hurdle on the road to British ratification of the Maastricht treaty. But in a withering attack on the prime minister from the floor of the Conservative conference, Lord Tebbit threatened to plunge the party into civil war. After a heated debate in Brighton which also saw Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, warn Tory activists that the party could 'break itself' over the issue, the prime minister won a four-to-one majority. Senior colleagues said Mr Major was now determined to bring the Maastricht legislation back to the House of Commons by the end of this month, even if the detailed examination of the bill had to be deferred until early next year. But during the angriest exchanges seen at a Tory conference for more than a decade, Lord Tebbit exposed the divisions which have dogged the Conservatives since they forced the then Mrs Margaret Thatcher's resignation two years ago. In a vituperative performance which played to the nationalism of the Tory party faithful, Lord Tebbit threatened at one point to turn the conference against Mr Major. More than a third of the representatives rose to their feet to cheer his demand that: 'This conference wants policies for Britain first, Britain second and Britain third.' In scenes reminiscent of the battles over Rhodesia which engulfed the Conservatives during the 1970s, Lord Tebbit delivered a stark warning to Mr Major that his battle with the party's Euro-sceptics would be protracted and bloody. As Mr Major sat grimly on the conference platform, Lord Tebbit won a standing ovation from large sections of the audience for a speech which derided the prime minister's economic policy and flatly condemned Maastricht. His intervention followed a similar attack on Maastricht earlier in the day by Mr Kenneth Baker. The former home secretary, who has now emerged at the head of opposition to the treaty in the House of Commons, said he would vote against the agreement that he had backed as a cabinet minister. The Euro-sceptics' stance was comprehensively rebutted by Mr Hurd in what was widely judged as a brilliant speech. It won him a standing ovation from many of the same representatives who had cheered Lord Tebbit. Mr Hurd warned that any move to renege on Maastricht would shove Britain and its government on to the 'sidelines' of Europe: 'Let us decide to give that madness a miss'. The foreign secretary announced that alongside the declaration on 'minimum interference' or 'subsidiarity' expected from the EC summit in Birmingham next week, Mr Major was seeking a commitment from his European counterparts to much greater openness in decision-making. Last night Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, joined the fray on the side of the prime minister by pouring scorn on the 'blind alley' into which opponents of Maastricht wanted to lead Britain. The government would no longer have a voice in international affairs if it opted for 'splendid political isolation'. Both Mr Hurd and Mr Clarke stressed that Maastricht would lead the Community not in the direction of a European 'superstate' but along the road of decentralisation and enlargement in the Community. He insisted that the government was winning the argument over the future direction of Europe. Senior ministers said the government had been shaken by the force of Lord Tebbit's attack. But it had also reinforced Mr Major's determination to use his closing address on Friday to reinforce his support for the treaty. That would follow a speech tomorrow by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, setting out the central planks of the economic policy which will replace the European exchange rate mechanism.

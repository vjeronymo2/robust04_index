The survey refers to figures obtained during the first week  in March and recalls that last January, Perez de Cuellar and  Fujimori were tied with 43.1 percent each.    The survey was conducted after the sale of Telefonica  Peruana  and Entel Peru [National Telecommunications Enterprise of Peru]  to Telefonica de Espana for a total of $2.002 billion, which was  considered an economic success for Fujimori's government.    It must be noted that Perez de Cuellar has been reluctant to  accept his possible candidacy for the presidency despite Imasen  results showing that he has more than 45 percent support.    The same survey shows that if Fujimori runs against Lima  Mayor Ricardo Belmont he would obtain 49.6 percent of the votes  against 31.3 percent for Belmont, who obtained 1.3 percent more  than in a previous survey.    Legislators Fernando Olivera and Enrique Chirinos have said  that if Fujimori runs for reelection, as authorized by the 1993  Constitution, he must resign his post six months before,  according to Olivera, and four months before, according to  Chirinos.</p>

			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / Observer: Handy A missed introduction has turned into a golden handshake for one Andre Verbruggen. As sales director of the French office equipment firm ATAL, he was manning his company's stand at a Brussels exhibition when up for a chat rolled King Baudouin of the Belgians. Alas Verbruggen neglected to introduce the king to his boss, who was so put out that he fired the sales director for a 'serious misdemeanour'. Whereupon Verbruggen appealed, and in his case before an employment tribunal received supporting evidence from the king, to whom he had written. Baudouin's testimony, sent through the Grand Marshal of the Belgian court, pointed out that protocol forbade a lowly subject to take the initiative in introducing royalty. Indeed, by imposing on the king the necessity of shaking hands with the boss, the sales director would have shown disrespect for the sovereign. The tribunal handed down the judgment that there was no 'real and serious' case for the dismissal, and awarded Verbruggen Pounds 20,000-plus in damages and back-pay.</p>

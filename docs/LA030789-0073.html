			<p><P> March 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DAMAGE TO NUCLEAR ARMS PLANT DETAILED  </P> <P> A January accident at a nuclear weapons reactor in South Carolina may have  resulted in significantly more damage than engineers initially believed, a  newspaper reported today.  </P> <P> An Energy Department investigation of the Jan. 22 accident at the Savannah  River plant, during which pressurized water in a reactor cooling system shook  pipes and caused some valves to break, found that two 95-ton heat exchangers  may have been ruined, the New York Times reported, quoting government  engineers.  </P> <P> The Energy Department is further examining the heat exchangers to determine  whether they need to be replaced, the paper said. "We have seen an elevation of  tritium levels in the exchangers," said John Patterson, the department's  assistant manager for reactor operations at Savannah River. "We'll know within  a month whether we'll have to replace them."  </P> <P> The exchangers transfer heat from the primary system for cooling the reactor to  the secondary cooling system. Following the January accident, technicians found  that the secondary cooling system's water contained levels of radioactive  tritium that were hundreds of times higher than normal, indicating leaks inside  the exchangers.  </P></p>

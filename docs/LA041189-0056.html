			<p><P> April 11, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MORE MINORITY STUDENTS, FACULTY URGED AT UCI  </P> <P> UC Irvine Chancellor Jack W. Peltason met Monday with student protesters who  demanded increased recruitment of minority students and faculty at UCI,  establishment of an African American studies department and increased funding  for minority-student programs.  </P> <P> The meeting with Peltason followed a noon news conference at which  representatives of five student groups presented demands and circulated  petitions seeking the resignation of UC President David Gardner because of what  they called "his lack of response in addressing the needs of under-represented  UC students." The students also planned a "teach-in" protest today at the Bren  Events Center.  </P> <P> "They've got to start opening doors today," said Stephanie Lopez, a  representative of the Associated Graduate Students of UCI, "or we're going to  kick the doors down tomorrow."  </P> <P> In an hourlong session with 16 students Monday afternoon, Peltason said that  recruiting minority faculty and students "is very high on my list of  priorities."  </P> <P> "More than one-half of the offers being made to prospective faculty members  (for the 1989-90 academic year) are being made to women and minority faculty,"  the chancellor said. "And almost 20% of the admissions for next year are for  persons of under-represented minorities."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 4 Instructors Left  </P> <P> Last fall, UCI had five black and 22 Latino faculty members with tenure among  637 total tenured faculty. At least four black faculty members left the school  in 1988, three because they were not promoted. Black and Latino undergraduates  at UCI totaled 10.5% last fall, compared to an average 13.8% for all eight UC  undergraduate campuses.  </P> <P> The protesters -- representing black, Latino, gay and lesbian, and graduate  student groups -- met with Peltason, Executive Vice Chancellor Chang-Lin Tien  and Vice Chancellor Horace Mitchell in the campus Cross Cultural Center, a  $750,000 gathering place for minority students that was finished in March.  </P> <P> However, no Asians -- who now make up more than a third of UCI's undergraduate  students -- joined in the protest.  </P> <P> In addition to recruiting and other minority-related demands, students called  for appointment of a full-time paid director of the Gay and Lesbian Student  Union, opening married student housing to gay couples, providing low-cost  health insurance for graduate students and student employees, and allowing  greater student control of facilities that are funded with student fees, such  as the University Center.  </P> <P> None of the complaints appeared to be resolved by the end of the  sometimes-contentious session, in which administrators argued that more money  is being funneled to minority organizations but that no campus group had gotten  funding for everything on its wish list.  </P> <P> Melissa Soto of the gay and lesbian group called Peltason's statements  "rhetoric. Changes are not being made," she said.  </P> <P> University Ombudsman Ron Wilson said the protesters are representative of many  UCI students.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Concerned and Serious'  </P> <P> "We are dealing with students who are frustrated, angry and who are concerned  and serious about their concerns," Wilson said, adding: "We have not adequately  dealt with the needs of gay and lesbian students here.  </P> <P> "We are now trying to aggressively pursue minority faculty and staff, but we  haven't in the past. And we've attracted (minority) students; we just have not  been successful in retaining them."  </P></p>

			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / UK softens stance on EC social charter THE GOVERNMENT can now support most elements of the European Social Charter, although remaining opposed to some of the proposals, according to Mr Michael Howard, the employment secretary. His remarks, in an interview with the Financial Times, suggest that much of the hostility towards the charter expressed by the British government under Mrs Margaret Thatcher has disappeared. Mr Howard said he had been 'very encouraged' by the recent approach of Ms Vasso Papandreou, European social affairs commissioner, and by changes in the form and content of legislative proposals. His comments represent the most conciliatory note struck so far between the British government and the European Commission over the social charter. The government originally criticised it on the grounds that it would damage business. They follow attempts by Mr John Major, the prime minister, to improve relations with the European Community. Mr Howard said he believed Britain would now be opposed to only a dozen of the 50 proposals expected in the 'social action programme'. The minister has said until now that a third of the social action proposals would be acceptable, a third would have to be negotiated and a third would be unacceptable. He said changes in the past six months had led to a significant shift in these proportions. 'There are many measures which we fully support, indeed the majority of measures coming out under the social action programme. There are some we shall continue to resist,' said Mr Howard last week. The government had managed to negotiate changes in the form of some proposals, he said. It had also been encouraged because some of the proposals which it thought were going to appear as being directives have become non-binding recommendations. He said he had been encouraged when Ms Papandreou accepted his suggestions earlier this year that draft proposals should be shown to member states before being published, and that each government should help evaluate the costs to business. Among the proposals which have proved less difficult than the British government feared is the directive on written employment contracts first published in November. However, directives on working time and employee consultation remain controversial. Separately, Mr Howard said he was keeping under review the rule that the employer-led Training and Enterprise Councils should be headed only by chairmen and chief executives of private-sector companies, and in no case by personnel directors. He said a future trade union act following a general election would probably contain proposals to tighten the regulation of union financing in view of anomalies shown by the handling of National Union of Mineworkers' finances. Mr Howard also reiterated that the 26 wages councils setting minimum wages for 2.5m workers had 'no permanent place' and would eventually be abolished by the government. Monday interview, Page 38</p>

			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Gas price formula may go to MMC BRITISH Gas could face a Monopolies and Mergers Commission investigation if it fails to agree in the next week to revise its formula for setting the price of gas for 17m domestic and small business customers. The company was last night finalising its response to an 11-month review into the formula and said it would respond to the industry regulator's proposals by the end of April. The Office of Gas Supply (Ofgas) is apparently planning to turn the review over to the MMC if British Gas does not respond in the next week. The pricing formula review is the first since British Gas was privatised five years ago. If British Gas accepts Ofgas's proposals, it will face tighter controls on standards of service and a less generous pricing formula, which should reduce consumers' energy costs. Ofgas argues that, in the absence of competitive suppliers of gas, it must force British Gas to set public standards, for example on call-out times and disconnections, against which it can be held to account. Under its current price formula, British Gas can increase prices by the rate of general price inflation, less an efficiency clawback of two percentage points. The company is also allowed to pass on to customers all increases in the cost of North Sea gas. Gas users have complained that this structure provides no incentive for British Gas to seek lower-priced supplies. Ofgas has also queried whether British Gas operates its own gas fields in the most efficient way. At the same time, Ofgas is likely to reduce the amount British Gas can add to prices to account for inflation. This is most likely to take the form of increasing the so-called efficiency factor from two to perhaps three or four percentage points a year. When the regulator revamped British Telecom's pricing structure three years ago, this element was increased from three to 4.5 percentage points. The Gas Consumers Council has called on British Gas to cut the inflation-related increase it adds on to prices, but not by cutting the quality of service it offers consumers.

			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / Observer: Hot seat Ian Irvine, deputy chief executive of Reed International, is the latest senior businessman to be sounded out for the top job in ITV - chief executive of the commissioning system for the new centralised network to be introduced next year. Irvine is an inspired choice. He is a serious businessman who would be able to handle the Pounds 500m or so a year programme budget. On top of that, as a former chairman of TV-am, he has at least a passing acquaintance with the colourful ways of Britain's commercial television. Pay is not a problem. For the right chief executive, up to Pounds 300,000 a year could be on the table. The only problem is that Ian Irvine is the latest in a long and distinguished line to say no. Some TV executives have been heard to ask plaintively how they can get their names taken off the list. Those considered capable of doing the job think it would be like sitting on the original bed of nails at the centre of 15 companies notorious for their inability to agree on anything. And those who actually want the job are by definition deemed irredeemably unsuitable. But there's plenty of time yet. ITV does not expect to have to take a decision before the end of May.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Yang Hui-chen and Benjamin Yeh] </F>   [Text] Hangzhou, June 11 (CNA) -- The trial of the three  men charged with robbing and murdering 32 people, including 24  Taiwan tourists, aboard a boat on Qiandao Lake March 31 ended  here Saturday [11 June], with the verdict to be delivered on  Sunday.    The judge heard the last statements by the prosecutor, the  defendants and their lawyers before he closed the hearing, which  began Friday and lasted for two hours Saturday morning.    The three defendants -- Wu Lihong, Hu Zhihan, and Yu Aijun  --  all pleaded guilty Friday.    No relatives of the Taiwan victims appeared at the court to  protest Beijing's decision to limit access to the trial.    Beijing agreed to allow victims' relatives to attend the  trial, but barred Taiwan reporters, lawmakers and Straits  Exchange Foundation (SEF) officials. Taiwan reporters were  permitted to watch the trial via closed-circuit television. SEF  is a semi-official organization authorized by Taiwan to handle  private exchanges between the two sides in the absence of  official contacts across the strait.    In Taipei, eight relatives of the victims held a news  conference Friday, saying the trial was another attempt by  Beijing to cover up the crime.    "Whatever the result of the trial, we will never accept it,"  a relative told reporters.    The Qiandao Lake incident occurred on March 31 when 32  people  were murdered and robbed aboard a pleasure boat ferrying them  across the Zhejiang Province lake. Beijing did not publicize  the incident until two days later and did not admit the deaths  involved foul play until Taiwan threatened to review fragile  cross-Taiwan Strait ties.    Beijing then arrested the three suspects and a fourth  implicated in the incident and made public the alleged  investigative report which many here said has raised more  questions than it answers.    Different accounts of the incident have since emerged, with  the latest one coming from legislator Parris Chang, a member of  Taiwan's largest opposition group, the Democratic Progressive  Party.    Chang told a recent seminar that the murder was carried out  by a squad of some 10 People's Liberation Army soldiers who were  executed shortly after the incident.</p>

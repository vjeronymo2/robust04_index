			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Books: Emerald City blues BFI FILM CLASSICS BFI Publishing, Pounds 5.99 GEORGE CUKOR: A DOUBLE LIFE by Patrick McGilligan Faber Pounds 16.99, 392 pages MARILYN'S MEN: THE PRIVATE LIFE OF MARILYN MONROE by Jane Ellen Wayne Robson Books Pounds 16.95, 236 pages MARILYN: THE LAST TAKE by Pete Brown and Patte Barham Heinemann Pounds 17.50, 486 pages 'WHEN I first saw The Wizard of Oz', claims Salman Rushdie, 'it made a writer of me.' Can he ever forgive it? To Dorothy, to Toto, to the Cowardly Lion, he owes his exile from human society, from which he now sends a love letter - or a castaway's note in a bottle - that sees print as one of four pilot volumes in a new series of 'BFI Film Classics.' Rushdie's 64-page essay on The Wizard of Oz joins Penelope Houston on Went The Day Well, Edward Buscombe on Stagecoach and Richard Shickel on Double Identity. Three great films and a British curio, Houston picking the Graham Greene-based wartime thriller about Nazis infiltrating an English village. The books are a splendid start to the series of 360 movie monographs promised: part of a tie-in enterprise with the National Film Archive aimed at celebrating a pantheon of world cinema. Fashioned on an all-you-need-to-know principle - production history, critical analysis, popular response - the style is flexible enough to allow each author to write to his/her strength. No doubt the volume quickest to be whittled down in the bookshops will be Rushdie's. Such is the fame of the fatwa'd. His essay exists on a more mystical plane. Instead of seeing one film in The Wizard of Oz, Rushdie sees a dozen. A film about childhood, about Hollywood, about good and evil; a film that embodies for him the West's answer to the garish Hindi musicals he grew up with. Rushdie likes fancy and surmise as much as provable fact. He perpetuates the doubtful tales of munchkin actors running amok in Hollywood. At the end he launches into a series of Wizard of Oz-inspired prose poems - if anyone should have his poetic licence extended rather than endorsed, it is this writer. 'A minor book full of fourth-rate imagery.' Thus George Cukor on The Wizard of Oz, soon after he was hired and fired as one of its four directors. But then a fairy tale like L. Frank Baum's was perhaps too close to home for this film-maker. As biographer Patrick McGilligan explains in George Cukor: A Double Life, Cukor was Hollywood's only major gay director and 'that fairy' was a frequent casus belli comment prompting a bust-up with a star or Cukor's exit from a movie. Most famously from Gone With The Wind, which he left after Clark Gable objected to his spending more time fussing around Vivien Leigh and her wardrobe than honouring the film's action and spectacle elements. But what would one expect from a man who made the best women's pictures in Hollywood history? Garbo in Camille, Hepburn in The Philadelphia Stoy, Garland in A Star Is Born: all excelled in the intelligently cosseting conditions Cukor created on set. McGilligan's only faults are that he overdoses us on the gay tittle tattle, and like every Cukor apologist he overstates the case for A Star Is Born. Less a masterpiece than a glamorous melodramatic sprawl, it embodies, even as it claims to chastise, that uncontrolled cosmos known as the entertainment industry. One star flung way out of orbit by it was Marilyn Monroe. The Marilyn factory is at it again on the 30th anniversary of her death. Is there any conspiracy material left to find or invent? Yes indeed. Of the first two books into the shops, Jane Ellen Wayne's Marilyn's Men: The Private Life of Marilyn Monroe digs up an early husband and swears him in on the witness stand. Book two, Marilyn: The Last Take, probes the poor girl's final weeks in exhausting detail. Wayne's book, written in tabloid prose, dubs Monroe 'tragedy's child' and presents her as a victim of the casting couch who in her 'hunger for love' became addicted to her own humiliation. But rather than exploring the complexities of Monroe's personality, the book merely pastes up the old scandals, along with new asides from the ex-spouse. Pete Brown and Patte Barham have done more homework, but they too end up with tunnel vision. They see government conspiracy everywhere, in an unlikely alliance with 20th Century Fox. That studio abandoned the star's last film, Something's Got To Give, when an already unreliable Monroe dashed off to sing 'Happy Birthday' to JFK at Madison Square Garden. Fox was already in trouble with Cleopatra, as the authors explain at excessive length: sometimes the book reads like a Taylor biography. Alas, poor Marilyn. Whether she killed herself or was murdered, she was already well advanced on the road to destruction. My theory is that she was a frail soul exposed too long to the stroboscopic life of the superstar: that merciless alternation between mega-watt attention by day and lonely self-confrontation by night. Few but those fortified by their own ambition and narcissism can survive. Marilyn Monroe, to her credit, may have had too little of either.</p>

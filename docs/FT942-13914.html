			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Lloyds / Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester: Customers likely to get bonanza pay-out Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester customers stand to receive a bonanza if the deal with Lloyds Bank goes through as planned and if the Building Societies Commission approves the decision to divide the Pounds 1.8bn between C&amp;G's staff and 1.4m customers. That C&amp;G should have managed to negotiate such generous terms with Lloyds is perhaps fitting, since it was C&amp;G which set the fashion for paying bonuses when it took over Guardian building society in 1990. 'There is nothing to touch this,' said Mr John Wriglesworth, building societies analyst at UBS. All C&amp;G customers as of March 31 1994, will benefit once the takeover is completed. Borrowers Those who have a mortgage will receive a cheque for Pounds 500 for each mortgaged property. Those in arrears will receive Pounds 500 credited to their mortgage account. Savers A distinction is drawn between savers who are voting members and those who are not. Those who hold a share account, such as Cheltenham Gold, London Share, Instant 7 or the society's tax-exempt special savings account are automatically voting members, as are borrowers. But of C&amp;G's 1m investors, 60,000 are not members and a further 130,000  - children and those with a balance of less than Pounds 100 - are members without voting rights. All savers will receive a percentage - expected to be 10 per cent - of the balance in each of their investment accounts, to a maximum of Pounds 10,000 per account, as long as the account was open on March 31 and remains open until the takeover is completed. The 10 per cent will be calculated on the lower balance at March 31 1994, or on the completion date. Children's accounts also qualify for the pay-out. In addition, investor voting members will receive Pounds 500 as long as they were members of the society at December 31 1993. Trustees who are voting investors also share this benefit. A borrower with a share account would be able to pick up two lots of Pounds 500 as well as the percentage balance payment. Creditors Investors in the society's permanent interest-bearing shares on or before March 31 1994, are entitled to Pounds 500 if they are a voting member, as well as a percentage of the balance.  -----------------------------------------------           ....IN A FRAGMENTED MARKET  ----------------------------------------------- Building societies mortgage market shares  ----------------------------------------------- Net advances                    1993 (percent)  ----------------------------------------------- Halifax                              18.4 Northern Rock                         6.3 Woolwich                              5.8 Leeds                                 4.3 Bradford &amp; Bingley                    3.8 Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester               3.8 Britannia                             3.7 Yorkshire                             2.4 National &amp; Provincial                 2.4 Birmingham Midshires                  2.4 Bristol &amp; West                        1.8 Coventry                              1.1  -----------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 30 Mar (MENA)--The Palestinian and Israeli  delegations led by Nabil Sha'th and Amnon Shahaq resumed their  negotiations here this evening.    A Palestinian source has told MENA that the two sides will  discuss how to reach an agreement on the security arrangements  and international protection in Hebron in accordance with  Security Council Resolution 904. They will also discuss the  possibility of extending these arrangements to the Gaza Strip in  view of the deteriorating situation there after the killing of  six Palestinians in Gaza two days ago.    In its statement to MENA, the Palestinian source noted that  the two sides have not yet reached an agreement on the security  arrangements, adding that the negotiations are still going on in  this regard.    A Palestinian-Israeli subcommittee met all night last night  to discuss the volatile situation in the occupied territories.  The negotiators referred the outcome of their discussion  concerning these arrangements and international protection in  Hebron and Gaza Strip to the Palestinian leadership in Tunis and  the Israeli Government as part of the continued consultations.    MENA has learned from sources close to the negotiations that  the two delegations have met only when the green light has been  received from Tunis.    Israeli sources said that Israel has approved of the  presence  of 100 members of the Palestinian police force and 70  international observers armed with light weapons in Hebron.  However, Palestinian sources say the Palestinian delegation has  rejected the Israeli proposal.</p>

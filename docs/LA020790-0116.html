			<p><P> February 7, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BANK APOLOGIZES FOR NEWSLETTER'S ETHNIC SLURS  </P> <P> First Union National Bank on Tuesday stopped distributing copies of a  newsletter that referred to Germans as "Huns" and Japanese as "Nips" in an  article satirizing fears of foreign investment.  </P> <P> The bank also issued apologies about the article appearing in the Feb. 1  edition of the newsletter, which the bank said already had been mailed to about  600 of its customers, after it received media calls asking about the piece.  </P> <P> William R. Hackney III, First Union's chief investment officer and the author  of the article, referred questions to the bank's public relations staff.  </P> <P> "He was trying to satirize American economic weaknesses, and he deeply regrets  his choice of words," said First Union spokesman Jeep Bryant.  </P> <P> In response to a request for a copy of the newsletter, Bryant said the bank was  "embarrassed by its content . . . so we've stopped distributing it."  </P></p>

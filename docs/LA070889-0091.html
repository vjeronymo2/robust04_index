			<p><P> July 8, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PLAN FOR RETURN OF CHILDREN REJECTED  </P> <P> An Oregon Juvenile Court judge has rejected a plan submitted by the Ecclesia  Athletic Assn. for the return of 53 children taken into protective custody by  the state after a child's beating death.  </P> <P> The children were removed from a farmhouse near Sandy owned by the Los  Angeles-based group after Dayna Broussard, the 8-year-old daughter of group  founder Eldridge Broussard Jr., was beaten to death during a discipline session  last October.  </P> <P> Ecclesia members want the children returned to the farm for a summer camp that  would run from mid-August to mid-October, said Bart Wilson, manager of the  Clackamas branch of the state Children's Services Division.  </P> <P> But Clackamas County Juvenile Court Judge Robert Morgan rejected the plan  Thursday, saying it lacked detail and failed to show how funding could be  raised to take adequate care of the children.  </P></p>

			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / International Company News: Goldsmith sells 9.5% stake in Newmont SIR JAMES Goldsmith, the Anglo-French financier, for the second time in a month has sold a substantial stake in Newmont Mining, North America's biggest gold mining group. A consortium of Morgan Stanley International, Barclays de Zoete Wedd and Gordon Capital Corp has bought 9.5 per cent of Newmont, or 6.5m shares, and were offering them for sale at Dollars 45.50 each. The group said the sellers were affiliated with Sir James and his close colleague Lord Rothschild's J Rothschild Group. In a statement, Morgan Stanley said that once the share sale was complete, DIA Holdings, which is affiliated with Sir James, would hold about 19 per cent of Newmont Mining, and Holdgold, a Rothschild affiliate, would hold 3 per cent. Mr Gordon Parker, Newmont president, and other Newmont officials could not be reached for comment. The offering was not registered with US regulators and so was not open to US buyers. On April 23, Sir James sold a 10 per cent stake in Newmont Mining at Dollars 39.50 a share to the US money manager, Mr George Soros. The price of gold has risen by Dollars 33 a troy ounce since Sir James and Mr Soros publicised their deal, but it eased back yesterday and closed in London at Dollars 356.75 a troy ounce, down Dollars 1.05. Newmont shares fell Dollars  3/8 after the offering announcement, to Dollars 41 3/4 , in contrast to the April sale, when Newmont shares rose Dollars 3 to Dollars 45 7/8 . Sir James acquired a 42 per cent stake in Newmont, then worth about Dollars 1.1bn by swapping timber assets with Hanson, the Anglo-American conglomerate. A 2.6 per cent stake was placed with institutions late last year. Analysts said this year's gold rally provided a good opportunity for Sir James to take profits.</p>

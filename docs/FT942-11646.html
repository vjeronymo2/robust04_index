			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / Riva stalls on Ekostahl sale The future of eastern Germany's largest steel mill was yesterday thrown into jeopardy after Riva, the Italian privately-owned steel company, said it could not acquire the plant under the current arrangements. Officials from the Treuhand privatisation agency said yesterday, however, that a new round of talks would take place next week. Earlier in the day, Ms Birgit Breuel, Treuhand president, and Mr Emilio Riva had met in Berlin in an attempt to unlock the dispute between Riva and IG Metall, Germany's large engineering union. At issue in the dispute between both sides is the way in which Riva will reduce the workforce this year, what it will do with Ekostahl's subsidiary companies, and the composition of the supervisory board.</p>

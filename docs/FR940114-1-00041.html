Outreach Program <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Each State should encourage extensive community involvement in pedestrian and bicycle safety education by involving individuals and organizations outside the traditional highway safety community. Community involvement broadens public support for the State's programs and can increase a State's ability to deliver highway safety education programs. To encourage community involvement, States should: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Establish a coalition or task force of individuals and organizations to actively promote safe pedestrian and bicycle safety practices (see Program Management Component); <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Create an effective communications network among coalition members to keep members informed; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Provide materials and resources necessary to promote pedestrian and bicycle safety education programs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VIII. School-Based Program <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Each State should incorporate pedestrian and bicycle safety education into school curricula. Safe walking and bicycle-riding practices to and from school and school-related events are good health habits and, like other health habits, must be taught at an early age and reinforced until the habit is well established. The State Department of Education and the State Highway Safety Agency should: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Ensure that highway safety in general, and pedestrian and bicycle safety in particular, are included in the State-approved K&hyph;12 health and safety education curricula and textbooks; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Establish and enforce written policies requiring safe walking and bicycling practices to and from school, including use of bicycle helmets on school property; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Encourage active promotion of safe walking and bicycling practices (including helmet usage) through classroom and extra-curricular activities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IX. Driver Education and Licensing <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Each State should address pedestrian and bicycle issues in State driver education and licensing programs. Pedestrian and bicycle safety principles and rules should be included in all driver training and licensing examinations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> X. Evaluation Program <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Both evaluation and problem identification require good record keeping by the State and its political subdivisions. The State should identify the types and frequency of pedestrian and bicyclist crash problems in terms that are relevant to both the selection and evaluation of appropriate countermeasure programs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The State should promote effective evaluation of programs by: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Supporting the continuing analysis of police accident reports (PARs) of pedestrian and bicyclist crashes for both problem identification and program evaluation activities; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Encouraging, supporting, and training localities in impact and process evaluations of local programs; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Conducting and publicizing statewide surveys of public knowledge and attitudes about pedestrian and bicyclist safety; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Maintaining awareness of trends in pedestrian and bicyclist crashes at the national level and how this might influence activities statewide; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Evaluating the use of program resources and the effectiveness of existing general public and target population countermeasure programs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ensuring that evaluation results are an integral part of new program planning and problem identification. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

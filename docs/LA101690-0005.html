			<p><P> October 16, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTGOING ZOO DIRECTOR BLASTS A RANGE OF CRITICS;  </P> <P> GRIFFITH PARK: HE TAKES NO BLAME FOR PROBLEMS AT THE FACILITY, WHICH HE SAYS  HAS BEEN 'UNJUSTIFIABLY PILLORIED AND PERSECUTED.'  </P> <P> In a defiant speech to his superiors Monday, departing Los Angeles Zoo Director  Warren D. Thomas lashed out at city officials, federal inspectors, the Greater  Los Angeles Zoo Assn., the press and critics, taking no responsibility for  problems that prompted him to resign.  </P> <P> Thomas told the city's Recreation and Parks Commission, which oversees the  Griffith Park facility, that the zoo has been "unjustifiably pilloried and  persecuted" over the last month.  </P> <P> "It does no good for them to sit down here at City Hall and call shots for us  out in the trenches when they have no frame of reference," Thomas said.  </P> <P> He added that alleged violations of the U.S. Animal Welfare Act cited at the  zoo over more than three years "were basically minuscule" and questioned the  expertise of the U.S. Department of Agriculture inspectors who had threatened  legal action against the zoo.  </P> <P> Thomas, 59, resigned 10 days ago amid allegations of chronic deficiencies and  fiscal improprieties at the zoo. Officials said he resigned because of damage  to the zoo's reputation and his own.  </P> <P> His resignation was announced just hours before City Controller Rick Tuttle  released an audit that concluded Thomas had violated several City Charter  provisions in his operation of a special fund into which he deposited $78,003  in city money without his superiors' knowledge.  </P> <P> City officials had begun to examine Thomas' management of the zoo last month,  after The Times reported that the facility had been cited repeatedly by the  Agriculture Department for more than three years. The citations listed such  alleged violations as inadequate food storage, sanitation and drainage  problems, pest and rodent contamination, inadequate housing and run-down animal  barns.  </P> <P> The Times also reported that Thomas did not reply to a letter sent by the  Agriculture Department nearly a year ago demanding an immediate response to the  list of allegations.  </P> <P> In his remarks Monday, Thomas said The Times account was "a sensationalized  story which was calculated to scandalize and damage."  </P> <P> "It is incredible to me that these charges were made and printed in the paper  and virtually no one visited the zoo or asked the zoo staff to explain exactly  what these charges meant, their importance and what caused them," he said.  </P> <P> Craig Turner, metropolitan editor of The Times, replied: "The Times' articles  on the zoo situation were carefully researched and balanced. Moreover, the  reporter sought and received comment from city officials, including Mr. Thomas  himself, on all criticism leveled at the zoo."  </P> <P> Thomas seemed to reserve his sharpest criticism for the Greater Los Angeles Zoo  Assn., the nonprofit organization that raises funds for and helps run the zoo.  </P> <P> Thomas accused the association of meddling in the operation of the zoo and said  it has "never understood (its) role as a support group."  </P> <P> "Their aim has always been to protect themselves and their reputation -- often  at the city's expense -- with the ultimate goal of finally taking over the  zoo," he said.  </P> <P> The association should stop trying to "micro-manage" the zoo, he said, and  instead concentrate on raising funds and operating the concession stands.  </P> <P> He accused zoo association members of "promoting their own egocentric  aggrandizement in the community," but did not specify in what manner this was  done.  </P> <P> During the session, the commission listened to Thomas' speech and did not  attempt to ask questions. When he left, Thomas refused to answer a reporter's  questions about the allegations.  </P> <P> Thomas R. Tellefsen, chairman of the zoo association's executive committee,  said Monday that Thomas' accusations "really have nothing to do with the matter  at hand, which is that he did not deal with an issue that arose in the manner  that he should have."  </P> <P> Tellefsen added that the remarks indicate that the next few months will be a  difficult period for the management of the zoo because Thomas will remain in  charge until January.  </P> <P> "I would have hoped or thought there would have been a lot more sensitivity to  the morale of the zoo staff and of the (zoo association's) staff," he said.  </P> <P> Regarding the special fund he established, called the Zoo Emergency Fund,  Thomas said during his speech that it was made necessary by the city's  "inefficient" bureaucracy, which could not react quickly enough to his requests  for money for zoo projects.  </P> <P> "Had there been effective financial procedures set up for handling everyday  crises . . . there would have been no need for the Zoo Emergency Fund," he  said. "Whether right or wrong," he added, "the Zoo Emergency Fund was set up to  deal expeditiously with a spectrum of things."  </P> <P> According to the city controller's audit, Thomas established the fund with the  zoo association in 1987 with money collected from companies that paid fees for  use of the zoo grounds. The money should have gone to the city treasury, the  audit said. Less than half of the money was spent, most of it apparently for  equipment and other zoo expenses.  </P> <P> However, the auditors questioned a $17,000 advance Thomas took to pay for a  trip to Ethiopia this year and city officials said Monday they may attempt to  recover some of the money. Zoo association officials have said that, until  June, they believed city officials had authorized the account.  </P></p>

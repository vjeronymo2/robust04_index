			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Software raid in Beijing Chinese authorities yesterday raided a Beijing computer software distributor and four outlets, AP-DJ reports from Beijing. The Business Software Alliance, an industry-funded watchdog, nevertheless pressed on with calls for the Clinton administration to apply Section 301 of the US Trade Act to its dealings with Beijing. The decision whether to proceed with a so-called 'special 301' investigation is due today. If the US imposes 301 and carries out a probe into China's protection of intellectual property, Washington could impose stiff trade sanctions. The alliance said the raids by Beijing's Intellectual Property Tribunal were the first such action waged against illegal software dealers in China.</p>

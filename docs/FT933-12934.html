			<p>930722 FT  22 JUL 93 / Poland's Dollars 12bn debt talks collapse NEGOTIATIONS between Poland and its London Commercial Club creditors for a reduction in Warsaw's Dollars 12.1bn bank debt were suspended indefinitely yesterday, The Polish side rejected the banks' proposals as 'not acceptable'. Mr Krzysztof Krowacki, the chief negotiator, said: 'We did not expect such a tough approach. The banks have been sending out signals that we would be offered something serious. That is apparently not so.' Poland is seeking an agreement for a reduction of its 1 debt to more than 300 commercial banks similar to the two-stage, 50 per cent debt reduction agreed with the Paris Club on Dollars 33bn of official debt in April 1991. In May Poland and the banks agreed to enter negotiations on the basis of three principles which linked an eventual debt reduction agreement to Poland's capacity to pay and its existing agreement with the Paris Club. Mr Krowacki, who is being advised by Kidder Peabody, the US merchant bank and the US law firm, White &amp; Case, said: 'If the banks come up with a proposal in line with the three principles or are prepared to discuss our proposals, we would return to the table immediately. But there are no plans for this at present.' No comment was available from the banks last night.</p>

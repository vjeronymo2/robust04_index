			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Ashdown attacks PM's 'failure to lead': Liberal Democrat Conference A SUSTAINED onslaught on Mr John Major for failing to give a lead to the nation and to the international community was the theme of Mr Paddy Ashdown's rallying speech to the Liberal Democrats yesterday as the party ended its Harrogate conference. His attack, which won him a standing ovation, was coupled with a warning that the government's credibility had been so undermined by its mishandling of the economic crisis that from now onwards it was 'on borrowed time'. He said: 'Now we know them for what they are. The Tory party - the party of devaluation.' The Liberal Democrat leader, who has previously expressed praise for some of Mr Major's actions since achieving power, excoriated the prime minister as someone whose pledges were worthless, and who pretended the crisis was not there. Portraying Mr Major as the ancient mariner, Mr Ashdown depicted him as 'becalmed, alone, save for the loyal Lamont, the albatross of Thatcherism around his neck, his government paralysed by inaction'. He stopped short, however, of calling for the resignation of Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, saying instead that the priority was to restore stability and some control. He called on Mr Major to make a full statement about what the government intended to do; to put beyond doubt that the UK intended to return to the exchange rate mechanism; and to enable the Bank of England to start acting as an independent central bank. The prime minister's lack of leadership extended, he continued, to the UK's role in international affairs, most notably the future of the European Community and the plight of the people of Somalia and of the former Yugoslavia. On party strategy, the subject most discussed this week, Mr Ashdown applauded the decision on Wednesday that allows for dialogue and some joint action with members of other parties, saying: 'It is the role of our party to lead the process of working with others to assure the country's future.' He also urged Liberal Democrats to become the 'opportunity party', in areas such as education and housing. While his speech pledged conditional support for Mr Major over the economic crisis and over Maastricht, political realities were reflected in his light attack on Labour for joining the government's 'summer slumber'.</p>

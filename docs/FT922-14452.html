			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / EC refuses Irish shift in protocol on abortion A MAJORITY of Ireland's partners in the European Community yesterday refused to allow Dublin to modify its anti-abortion protocol attached to the Maastricht treaty for fear of opening a Pandora's box of other changes. Dublin wanted to reconcile its 1983 constitutional ban on abortion with the sort of case that recently arose when a 14-year-old Irish girl, pregnant after being raped, was initially denied the right to travel to Britain to get an abortion, but was later allowed to do so after a Supreme Court ruling. Mr David Andrews, foreign minister, suggested Ireland might have to delay the referendum on the Maastricht treaty planned for June to clarify the abortion issue. The insistence by Germany and France yesterday that the Maastricht treaty be left untouched reflects increasing nervousness that if even one part of the treaty were unstitched, the rest might fall apart under other demands for re-negotiation. Yesterday's move also has implications for Britain's position on the treaty. The Labour party would want to sign up to the EC social chapter on working conditions if it wins Thursday's UK election. However, it would now be difficult for Britain to renegotiate legally the opt-out on social policy. The only revision open to a Labour government would probably be the sort of interpretative 'solemn declaration' offered to Ireland yesterday. In what turned out to be a self-inflicted embarrassment, the Irish government insisted on adding to the Maastricht treaty a formal protocol, stating that nothing in the treaty would negate its constitutional ban on abortion. However second thoughts set in this year with the case of the 14-year-old. While finally allowing the girl to get an abortion in Britain, three of the Irish Supreme Court's five judges said that, in general, the rights of an unborn child took precedence over the (EC-enshrined) freedom to travel. What the Irish government was seeking yesterday was to add a sentence to its protocol, upholding its citizens' right to travel and to receive information on services legally available elsewhere in the EC.</p>

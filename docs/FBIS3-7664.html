Caparas] </F>   [Text] Puerto Princesa, Palawan -- After a boom-and-bust  cycle, which has become the trademark of the country's economic  performance, government is faced with a critical task of  sustaining the momentum of the reform process that has scored  economic gains, NEDA [National Economic and Development  Authority] Director-General Cielito Habito said during the first  day of the national consultative workshop of the Philippine  Futuristics Society.    Despite the challenge though, Mr. Habito is confident  sustainable growth would be achieved. "There are a number of  factors that underline an optimistic growth scenario for the  country in the next few years and beyond."    He said current economic reforms have provided comfortable  reasons to expect an enhanced productive capacity.    Projections by the National Economic and Development  Authority estimated investments, as share to real GNP, would  grow 9.9 percent in 1994. Correspondingly, Mr. Habito said  construction and manufacturing are expected to improve.    Mr. Habito observed this trend was, in fact, manifested  since  1993. "The manufacturing sector showed signs of good health and  is expected to improve further."    Construction was likewise noted to have improved.    Mr. Habito said during times of economic expansion,  productive capacity will improve.    Exports, as share to gross national product, are also  expected to grow 11.12 percent by the end of the year and a  robust 15.7 percent for the 1994-98 period. Growth of imports  will be slower vis-a-vis exports. For the 1994-1998 period,  imports are targeted to grow 13.6 percent.    In an interview with BUSINESS WORLD, Mr. Habito expressed  optimism inflation will remain at a single-digit average by the  end of the year despite the effects of the momentary increase in  oil prices and increasing labor cost.    Meanwhile, with the outward oriented economic reforms put in  place, Mr. Habito said the economy is in a much better position  to weather both internal and external shocks.    Towards the year 2000, the rapid growth within the  Asia-Pacific region and its participation in the AFTA [ASEAN  Free Trade Area] is expected to propel the country to a higher  growth path. The country's industries are thus expected to gain  world competitiveness.</p>

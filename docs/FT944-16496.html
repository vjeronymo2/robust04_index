			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / Tesco poised for deal on Virgin Cola Tesco is expected to announce today that it will have the exclusive rights to sell Mr Richard Branson's Virgin Cola for at least six months. The unexpected deal puts the UK's second-biggest supermarket chain head to head with J. Sainsbury, the biggest chain, in the Cola wars. In April Sainsbury became the first group to pose a serious challenge to Coca-Cola and Pepsi Cola, when it launched its Classic Cola brand. The deal with Tesco solves Virgin's main challenge in developing the new brand, announced by Virgin on Monday: how to achieve nationwide distribution. Mr Branson felt he needed a 7 per cent share of the UK retail market to make a success of the product and is understood to believe that the deal with Tesco will give him that 'at a stroke'. Virgin Cola will be available in Tesco's stores before the end of November. Virgin is expecting a very aggressive counter-offensive from Coca-Cola, and is planning to sign exclusive deals with an off-licence chain and a newsagent chain to secure access to every sector of the retail market. Both Tesco and Sainsbury are obtaining their cola syrup from the same source, Cott Corporation of Canada. Virgin has formed a 50-50 joint venture company with Cott to market its new product. The deal with Tesco is surprising after comments made by Mr Simon Lester, Cott's managing director, when Virgin Cola was launched. He said that the drink would be sold largely through independent retailers. Mr Mike Conolly, director for soft drinks at Sainsbury, said last night that his company had an exclusive deal with Cott for its recipe, developed in conjunction with Sainsbury's own buyers. However, Cott was free to enter into ventures with other retailers involving different formulations. 'It is hardly surprising that others should want to copy our success,' he said. He added that Sainsbury's Classic had had all summer to build customer loyalty, and had developed a 'healthy market share and a very loyal following'. Meanwhile, the Tesco deal could further dent Coca-Cola's market share in the UK. Within three weeks of Classic's launch in April, the Sainsbury brand had captured about 15 per cent by value of all Cola sales through any UK retail outlet. That compared with the 3 per cent market share held by Sainsbury's own label product previously. Coca-Cola was incensed by the launch of Classic, because it felt that the packaging design was too close to its own. Sainsbury has since subtly altered the packaging.</p>

			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Andreotti steps down as Italian PM FORMATION of a new Italian government moved a step closer yesterday following the resignation of Mr Giulio Andreotti as premier. The timing of Mr Andreotti's resignation had appeared in doubt, as a result of delays on Thursday in electing new leaders of the Senate and Chamber of Deputies following this month's general election. After two rounds of voting yesterday, Mr Giovanni Spadolini, of the Republican party, was re-elected president of the Senate. In the Chamber of Deputies, it took three votes to produce a majority for Mr Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, a veteran Christian Democrat. The nomination of the new parliamentary leaders had become the subject of intense debate as a result of the new political balance following the general election. The polls revealed sharply lower support for the Christian Democrats, still Italy's largest party, and their Socialist allies in the previous coalition government. President Francesco Cossiga yesterday threatened to step down, Reuter reports. Mr Cossiga, 63, said he would only remain in power if convinced that quitting would aggravate the political crisis.</p>

			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / Leading Article: Absent friends THE SUMMIT meeting in Madrid of the leaders of Spain, Portugal and Latin America is laden with symbolism, 500 years after Christopher Columbus arrived in the new world. Many of those present have good reason to celebrate, including the hosts. In contrast with a decade ago, democracy holds sway over much of Latin America, a fact which owes an important debt to Spain's own transition from dictatorship. There have been important advances too in economic policy in Latin America which in many countries have provided a foundation for sustained economic growth. The result is a wave of euphoria about Latin America's future, notably in financial markets. There are dangers in this change of sentiment: it fails to distinguish adequately between economies of highly variable performance, and risks ignoring some fundamental political and social questions which will have a profound effect on their future economic success. For this reason, the absences from the Madrid gathering are also significant. The Venezuelan president, Carlos Andres Perez, who survived an army coup attempt in February, was forbidden by his legislature to attend amid a continuing crisis of political confidence. Alberto Fujimori, the Peruvian leader who usurped constitutional rule in April, was forced to remain at home as a Maoist terrorist group conducts a series of bomb strikes in the heart of Lima. The Colombian head of state, Cesar Gaviria, postponed his visit as the leader of a notorious drugs gang escaped from prison, underlining the threat posed to the state by the drug traffickers. Among those attending, Fernando Collor of Brazil is riding out a corruption scandal at home which, at least, threatens to weaken him severely for the rest of his term. And Fidel Castro, the spectre at the feast, hardly provides the kind of democratic model the creators of these Ibero American get-togethers can have had in mind. Latin America's democracies are fragile, the institutions that support them often weak or inadequate. Guiding the reforms needed to sustain growth and deepen democracy requires a higher quality of leadership than Latin America has traditionally received from its presidents. Whether the Madrid summit can do anything significant to further such objectives must be doubtful. Despite strengthening investment links with the region, Spain's trade ties with Latin America are as yet marginal. Where interests clash, there is no doubt, either, that Spain's priorities will lie with the EC rather than its former colonies. Nevertheless, symbols have their importance, as has the current meeting's stress on democracy and human rights. If over time such gatherings reinforce Latin America's insertion into the world economy and into enduring membership of the community of democratic nations, then they will have their value.</p>

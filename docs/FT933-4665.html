			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Upward-only rent reviews defended RESEARCH contradicting claims that the commercial property market's system of upward-only rent reviews is inflationary was published yesterday by the British Property Federation. 'The report shows that, far from being inflationary, upward-only rent reviews have exerted a strong deflationary influence on the market,' said the federation which represents landlords. This came as part of the group's response to a government consultation paper about possible reforms to the commercial property lease structure. The system of upward-only rent reviews has been criticised during the recession because it has prevented rents paid by existing tenants from falling in line with rents being asked for empty properties. Although rental values moved faster than retail prices in the early 1970s and late 1980s, the rate of price inflation exceeded that of rental values for most of the last 22 years. 'The commercial lease has protected tenants against the full effects of rental value inflation,' the report says. Tenants would have paid more if they had replaced the conventional lease with an agreement to link rent increases to retail price inflation in each of the last 22 years except for 1989 and 1990. If the structure were changed, rents would rise in the longer term to protect investors against increased uncertainty and risk, the report says. Critics of the system include the Bank of England, which said earlier this year that 'upwards-only rent review clauses seem designed for a world which had the certainty of an upwards-only pattern of property values'. The options in the consultation paper include prohibiting upward-only reviews and allowing rents to move either up or down, but never below the initial rent.</p>

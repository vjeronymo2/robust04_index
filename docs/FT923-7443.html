			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / International Company News: Near-record results for Brazilian mining group COMPANHIA Vale do Rio Doce (CVRD), the state-controlled Brazilian mining firm, and the world's leading exporter of iron ore, recorded a profit of Dollars 234.7m for the first seven months of this year, nearly equalling the 1991 figure of Dollars 251.8m. Although not yet reflected in the results, the company's most significant move during the period was the signing of a management agreement in June with the government that will allow CVRD to operate more like a private company. It has been freed of administrative regulations governing state-owned companies, and will operate according to a set of goals negotiated between government officials and company management. Paranapanema, the world's largest tin exporter and Brazil's largest private mining company, posted profits of Dollars 17.5m for the first six months of 1992. Last year, the company lost Dollars 30.6m. The company said more favourable international tin prices were largely responsible for the rebound. Aracruz Celulose, a leading paper and pulp exporter, registered a slim profit of Dollars 3m for the first six months of this year, bouncing back from a loss of Dollars 97.1m last year. Most of the recovery was during the second quarter.</p>

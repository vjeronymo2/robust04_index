			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Yelena Kotelnikova report under the "`Aeroflot' </F> Privatization" rubric: "`Aeroflot' To Receive the Status of  National Carrier"]    [Text] The government has been pinning Russia's prospects  for securing a niche in the world air-travel market on Aeroflot.  From now on it will become our flag-carrier, a status set forth  in the government decree "On Approving the Charter of the  "Aeroflot -- Russian International Airlines" Joint-Stock  Company." While vesting Aeroflot with the right to represent  the country's interests on the world air-travel market, the  government is at the same time tightening state control over its  activity.    The "Aeroflot -- Russian International Airlines"  Joint-Stock Company was set up following the reorganization of  the "Aeroflot -- Soviet Airlines" commercial association, the  Central International Civil Aviation Air Traffic Administration,  the International Commercial Civil Aviation Administration, the  Sheremetyevo Technical Aviation Enterprise, the International  Payments Center, and the "Rossiya" Interregional Agency of  International Air Services.    According to the charter, Sheremetyevo international airport  and the Moscow Airlines company will be separated from Aeroflot  to become independent state-owned firms. The authorized capital  of the newly created open-end joint-stock company is  2,186,394,000 rubles. Before privatization begins, however, all  Aeroflot stock will be kept in federal ownership and will not be  offered for sale until the government so authorizes. The  documents envision the possibility of selling 49 percent of the  stock to the airline's workers, but the period of  denationalization is not specified: the White House has not yet  worked out a clear stance on the subject. Dividends accrued on  shares remaining in federal ownership must be paid exclusively  to the joint-stock company for three years, to be spent on  aviation technology and equipment purchases.    According to the concept devised by government experts,  apart from "protecting economic and other (which? --  KOMMERSANT-DAILY) interests" of Russia, Aeroflot's objective is  to make profits not only by "meeting requirements for  international and domestic air travel," but also by providing  other services. By so doing the government gives in advance the  go-ahead to any commercial activity by the leading airline.    This makes sense. Aeroflot is the sole Russian company that  can boast long years of operation on a highly competitive world  market. Such experience cannot be acquired by sitting in  government offices. Aeroflot's competitiveness has not been  dented by the emergence of other Russian airlines on the  international market. This was confirmed, for instance, by the  fact that Aeroflot was among two airlines operating  international services that ended last year with a profit (over  200 billion rubles), the other one being British Airways, which  earned around $100 million.    The government, however, thought it necessary to tighten  control over the activity of the enterprise. This will be  achieved primarily by changing the form of management. The  status of a joint-stock company calls for a board of directors  (seven people), whose chairman and members are appointed by the  government. The government will therefore be able to control  the entire day-to-day financial activity of a profitable  company. thus creating conditions for raising federal budget  revenues from its operations. This is why Aeroflot, of course,  will be in a privileged position when obtaining air-travel  licenses. Nonetheless, it is unlikely that state protection  will affect Aeroflot's pricing policy of setting the prices of  its services too high by comparison with their quality.</p>

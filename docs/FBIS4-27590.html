			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 30 (YONHAP) -- The government has decided  to send a 50-man medical unit to the West Sahara for about one  year as part of the United Nations Peacekeeping Operations  (PKO), the Defense Ministry said Monday.    At a cabinet meeting in the afternoon, the government  decided  to send a 20-strong advance team in early August if things go  well after the National Assembly approves the decision. The  main body is scheduled to be dispatched in mid-September,  according to ministry officials.    The medical unit will replace a Swiss Medical Service Unit  that has operated there since September 1992, establishing a  central medical office in the Laayoune region where the West  Sahara PKO (Minurso) headquarters are located. The ministry was  asked by the United Nations to send a medical unit to the West  Sahara last February, and it has since carried out a joint  on-the-spot survey with the Foreign Ministry to report to  related ministries.    The United Nations established the West Sahara PKO  headquarters in September 1992. Currently, 490 people from 27  countries are engaged in PKO activities, supervising the truce  in the region and preparing a referendum.    The West Sahara was under the rule of the Moroccan royal  family until 1884, when Spain colonized the region. As soon as  the Spanish withdrew in 1976, the Moroccan Government claimed  dominion over the region while the West Sahara Liberation Front  sought independence, leading to a dispute.</p>

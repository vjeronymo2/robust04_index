			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swedish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Now we turn to Swedish reaction to the latest  events concerning Bosnia. Prime Minister Carl Bildt advocates a  careful line in Bosnia, and he still hopes that negotiations  will cause the NATO threat not to be carried out; but Carl Bildt  is of the opinion that the decision was necessary.    [Begin recording] [Bildt] I think stronger military pressure  is necessary on both sides.    [Unidentified correspondent] Is it credible?    [Bildt] I think it is credible. It is clear through those  partial successes in the negotiations during the last 24 hours  that it is perceived as credible.    [Correspondent] The fact that Russia might not approve a  NATO  decision which has not been sanctioned beforehand in the UN  Security Council -- is this something to be taken into account?    [Bildt] Yes, this shows the tension regarding this question  between the different countries in the Security Council, but  NATO has now acted after consulting the UN secretary general,  who referred to Security Council resolutions within the  framework of which he considers that he is acting; and Russia  was there. [sentence as heard]    [Correspondent] There are many both open and veiled threats  from Russia on an escalation of the conflict. Do you think it  could spread outside Bosnia?    [Bildt] Yes, and that is why I have been slightly skeptical  regarding suggestions in the Swedish debate -- I should express  myself carefully -- suggestions that have meant that we should  take part in a considerable expansion of the conflict. I think  it is essential to have these dangers clear in one's mind.  Thus, to work for a political solution is no excuse in itself  to start on further violence. [end recording]    The person who wants to have harder measures, to which Carl  Bildt referred, is Pierre Schori, the Social Democratic foreign  policy spokesman. He is of the opinion that NATO could act now  with the mandate from the United Nations, and should do so if  the conditions are not met.    [Begin recording] [Schori] It seems that they are serious  this time, and it would be terrible if they again gave a warning  that they did not back up. The reactions of the Serbian army  also seem to indicate that they take it seriously.    [Correspondent] The threats coming from Russia -- is it  credible when Zhirinovskiy says that this could be the beginning  of the third world war? Should one take this seriously?    [Schori] One can of course do this; one must listen to what  he says. But what is important now is to take the daily carnage  in Sarajevo seriously. Politics means to want something, but  politics also means to choose, and sometimes one must choose  between terribly difficult and maybe painful decisions, and here  we must choose between the oppressed and the oppressors, between  victims and executioners, and we must stand on the side of the  people in Sarajevo.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] The peace process in Liberia seems, for all intents  and purposes, to have been on the back burner for weeks now.  Disarmament of the warring factions has come to a halt and  clashes have continued. The peacekeeping forces had its hands  tied to intervene but the last thing the ruling council wants is  for the factions to continue to carry weapons a second longer  than necessary. So Charles Taylor's suggestion two weeks ago  that a transitional army should be set up with his NPFL  [National Patriotic Front of Liberia] providing half the force,  did not go down too well with the council. From Monrovia, Nii  Nartey Allison telexed this report.    Liberia's ruling council today rejected demands by NPFL  leader Charles Taylor for the formation of a transitional army.  State Council chairman David Kpomakpor said the council was  adamantly opposed to such a proposal. Addressing his first  meeting with reporters since assuming office in March, Kpomakpor  said it is counterproductive and we don't consider the issue  debatable. He went on to say while we were trying without  success to take away guns from the various armed factions, he  had proposed that we form another army with these same men and  return their guns to them. This is wrong. Kpomakpor also called  for a fresh meeting of the parties to the Cotonou Agreement to  review the Liberian peace process and he threatened to resort to  action if this proposal was not met. He blamed the slow pace of  the peace process on a lack of will from the warring factions  and said the situation rather than becoming better was, in fact,  getting worse.    Kpomakpor said the council is worried by pressure from the  United States Government that as of the end of this month, if 30  to 50 percent of the arms have not been taken away from the  warring factions, it would reconsider its position on Liberia  but he did not elaborate. Kpomakpor said the United States has  turned down requests to give recongnition to the transitional  government because the government itself lacks control over the  entire country.</p>

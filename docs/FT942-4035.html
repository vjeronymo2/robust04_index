			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: Directors' transactions Danka Business Systems was virtually unknown to UK investors three years ago. Despite its UK listing, its main business - supplying and servicing business equipment - was in the US. With a market capitalisation of more than Pounds 600m, most UK investors are well aware of the company now. The key directors, chairman Mark Vaughan-Lee, chief executive Dan Doyle and finance director David Snell, bought a total of 2.1m shares at a price equivalent to 40p in February 1992. At the start of this year, the shares peaked at 388p and now we are seeing some serious selling. Vaughan-Lee disposed of 320,000 at 347p, reducing his holding to 700,000, while Doyle sold 1.2m at 345p. He also exercised an option over 400,000 more and sold them, also for 345p, although he retains just under 7m. Capital &amp; Regional Properties, like many companies in its sector, has enjoyed spectacular share price performance since the start of 1993. Joint managing director Roger Boyland sold 221,491 shares at 174p leaving him with 500,000, the third-largest holding on the board. James Dewhirst, vice-chairman of clothing company Dewhirst Group, has been in the market adding to his holding. Between May 13 and May 23, he bought 75,000 shares at 118p. Now he has bought a further 105,000 at between 122p and 123p. Of the three Dewhirst family members on the board, however, his 3.2m shares remain the lowest holding. Dewhirst is one of the larger suppliers to Marks &amp; Spencer.  ------------------------------------------------------------------ DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR OWN COMPANIES (LISTED &amp; USM)  ------------------------------------------------------------------                                                             No of Company                      Sector       Shares   Value  directors  ------------------------------------------------------------------ SALES  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Bearing Power Intnl            Dist      200,000      41      1 Boxmore Intn'l                 PP&amp;P       53,000     145      3 Cap &amp; Reg Prop                 Prop      221,491     385      1 Danka Business Sys.

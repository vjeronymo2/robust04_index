			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Throgmorton Trust net assets decline The fully diluted net asset value per share of Throgmorton Trust was 57.8p at November 30 1992, against 70.2p a year earlier. Net revenue for the 12 months fell from Pounds 7.44m to Pounds 6.68m for earnings per share of 2.35p (2.63p). The recommended final dividend of 1.4p maintains the total for the year at 2.3p. Lord Stewartby, chairman, said that although there had been a significant improvement in the past two months - net assets per share had risen to 71.4p by January 31 - the figures for the past year related to a period of almost unprecedented turbulence and difficulty for the financial markets. During the summer there had been a serious loss of confidence, with a consequent weakening of UK investment values, the chairman said. However, since September, the combination of lower interest rates and more competitive exchange rates had improved the outlook for the economy. There were now clear signs of positive interest in smaller companies, and the reduction in the value of the trust's portfolio last year had, by the end of January, been more than recovered.</p>

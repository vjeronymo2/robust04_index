			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] The 5 Mar 94 REAKSMEI KAMPUCHEA on pages  1 and 11 reported on First Prime Minister Prince Krompreah  Norodom Ranariddh's "recent" trip to Mondolkiri Province. The  prince is quoted as saying "it is not right for Cambodian  provincial governors to have to ask Vietnamese permission to  transit [SRV] territory...we should be able to travel...on our  own territory." He pledged that the government would build a  road "as soon as possible"from Memot [Kompong Cham Province] and  Snuol [Kratie Province] into Mondolkiri and Ratanakiri  Provinces. He said assistance for this would be sought from the  United States and "other friendly countries."    The article noted that what roads there are in northeastern  Cambodia have sustained war damage and are still mined.  Ranariddh said that construction of "strategic roads along  borders" would facilitate border defense and security. He  concluded by saying that "if we cannot build these roads, we  cannot resettle people" in the border areas.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Phnom Penh, June 19 (XINHUA) -- The representative  office of the Democratic Kampuchea Party (DKP) here is  postponing its withdrawal from the capital till June 20, as  their visas for Thailand are unavailable on the weekend.    The Interior Ministry of the royal government had asked all  DKP officials to leave the capital before June 19 for security  reasons, but notified them of the request as late as 6:30 PM of  June 17.    The DKP representative office agreed to the request on June  18 morning, but failed to get the visas as the Thai Embassy was  closed as usual at weekends. The DKP people are expected to  return to their base area via Thailand.    Informed of their trouble, King Norodom Sihanouk instructed  the Royal Palace Office and the government to arrange the DKP's  departure well, and the Interior Ministry granted the officials  a one-day delay.    There was no demonstration against the DKP here in the past  two days as the royal government had claimed to be fearing of.    One news source said that Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign  Minister Norodom Sirivudh, secretary-general of the FUNCINPEC  party, said his party took exception to the government decision  to expel the DKP office from Phnom Penh.</p>

			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Overture to opposition by Finnish coalition FINLAND'S ruling centre-right coalition yesterday agreed to hold talks with the opposition Social Democrats on the country's economic problems, but it rejected an opposition demand to broaden the government. Mr Esko Aho, the prime minister, made his offer after the Social Democrats emerged as the main winners in Sunday's local election. They won 27.1 per cent of the vote, 5 points up on their performance in last year's general election. Mr Aho's ruling Centre party unexpectedly took only 19.2 per cent. Their main coalition partner, the Conservatives, captured 19.4 per cent. Contrary to forecasts, the Greens did not make much headway and won only 6.9 per cent of the vote, while the former Communists - the Left Federation - won 11.9 per cent. The city and municipal elections took place amid speculation that if the ruling parties were routed the coalition could fall apart. Mr Ulf Sundqvist, the leader of the Social Democrats, said yesterday that the government had to make changes in its latest crisis package, which includes a compulsory savings scheme as well as sweeping cuts in government spending and tax increases to reduce the budget deficit. Finland's gross domestic product declined 6.5 per cent in 1991. The unemployment rate, at 13.6 per cent in August, is one of the highest in western Europe. 'The country's economic problems remain and considering the challenges we face in the next half year we must get the country back into shape,' said Mr Pertti Salolainen, the foreign trade minister.</p>

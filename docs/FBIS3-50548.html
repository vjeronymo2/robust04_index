			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Maricarmen Camacho from Tuxtla Gutierrez] </F>   [Text] The bishops of the three dioceses of Chiapas  State--namely, Felipe Arismendi Esquivel of Tapachula, Samuel  Ruiz Garcia of San Cristobal de las Casas, and Felipe Aguirre  Franco of Tuxtla Gutierrez--have reaffirmed their willingness to  mediate between the armed groups and representatives of the  Mexican Government to establish a dialogue and find a solution  to the conflict in the Chiapas State highlands.    During a news conference San Cristobal Bishop Samuel Ruiz  Garcia said that they are awaiting a positive reply from  subversive groups to the start of negotiations and an end to the  armed confrontations.    [Begin Ruiz recording] We proposed contributing our  recognized moral influence; all three of us agree with that  service proposal. The mediation process will depend on the  parties' behavior. We hope to be able to reach the party that  declared war to find out whether it accepts our mediation.    What follows? We do not know, because that depends on the  circumstances. All we can do is voice our willingness to serve  as mediators. We will not hold talks with them, only serve as  mediators of a dialogue. [end recording]    The three bishops said they deeply regret the developments  at  the start of 1994. Deputy Government Secretary Ricardo Garcia  Villalobos has reported that the Mexican Government is willing  to hold talks with representatives of the subversive groups to  settle this problem.</p>

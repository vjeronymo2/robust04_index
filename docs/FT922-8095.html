			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / International Company News: Novo Nordisk profits surge 38% NOVO NORDISK, the Danish pharmaceutical and industrial enzymes group, increased first quarter net profit by 38 per cent to DKr324m (Dollars 51m) from DKr234m. Sales were up by 20 per cent to DKr2.66bn from DKr2.22bn in the first quarter of last year. Pre-tax profit was 33 per cent higher, rising from DKr354m to DKr470m. Earnings per share increased by 18 per cent from DKr7.41m to DKr8.74m. Novo Nordisk warned that sales and profits would not rise as fast in the rest of the year. First quarter results were affected by the fact that some important customers took delivery of shipments earlier than expected. Sales were also boosted by currency factors. The company expects to achieve at least 15 per cent growth in pre-tax profits, in line with its long-term earnings objective. The group's capital expenditure will increase strongly from DKr1.3bn to about DKr2bn, mainly with the aim of increasing production capacity internationally.</p>

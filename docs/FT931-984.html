			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Bosnian Moslems and Croats sign final peace papers: Milosevic offers to host ceasefire talks between UN and Serbs A BREAKTHROUGH in the Bosnian peace negotiations in New York, and a call by President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia for a negotiated ceasefire, last night provided the first real hope for months of an end to the year-long conflict in Bosnia. Bosnian Moslem and Croat leaders last night signed the remaining documents in the peace package proposed by international mediators. But the Bosnian Serbs maintained their refusal to endorse the most controversial elements of the peace plan, notably the map of the 10 semi-autonomous provinces into which Bosnia would be divided. It was nevertheless the first significant development in the negotiations in New York chaired by Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen since all the warring Bosnian parties endorsed the mediators' constitutional framework for Bosnia in Geneva at the start of the year. The United Nations Security Council last night welcomed the signing of the documents and called for a 'cessation of hostilities by all parties' in Bosnia. It said it stood ready to take the 'steps required' to bring a peace settlement - an indication it could tighten economic and political sanctions if necessary to put pressure on the Serbs. After talks with General Philippe Morillon, the commander of UN forces in Bosnia, Mr Milosevic offered to host ceasefire talks between Gen Morillon and Gen Ratko Mladic, the commander of the Bosnian Serb army in Belgrade today. 'We want to support efforts . . . for a complete ceasefire in Bosnia-Hercegovina,' Mr Milosevic said. He has voiced similar sentiments before, and the real test of his sincerity will be the extent to which he is prepared to put pressure on both Gen Mladic and Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader. The immediate effect of yesterday's signing by Moslems and Croats of the provincial map and interim arrangements for the administration of Bosnia until elections are held, is to isolate Mr Karadzic. In Washington, the White House, echoing a television interview given by President Bill Clinton on Wednesday night, said that arming Bosnia's Moslems would have to be an option to be considered if the Vance-Owen peace process failed because of Serb intransigence. However, Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, cautioned against the selective lifting of the UN arms embargo on the former Yugoslavia. Among the objections to such a step were the difficulty of securing united Security Council approval and the additional threats that might be posed to existing humanitarian operations in Bosnia. Instead, Mr Hurd envisaged a further tightening of the economic embargo on the rump Yugoslavia, exempting only humanitarian supplies, but involving air, sea and river blockades, particularly on the Danube, and the impounding of cargoes. After hesitating for many weeks, Mr Alijah Izetbegovic finally signed both the map dividing Bosnia into 10 semi-autonomous provinces and the interim arrangements covering the period between the conclusion of a peace settlement and the holding of elections in Bosnia.</p>

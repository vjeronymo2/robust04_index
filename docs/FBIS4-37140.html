			<p>BFN     [Text] Sanaa, 17 Jun (INA)--The Yemeni security forces have  arrested a saboteur whom the Saudi authorities sent to carry out  acts of sabotage in Yemen as part of the Saudi conspiracy  against Yemeni unity and the Saudi support for the secessionists  in southern Yemen.    An informed Yemeni security source told an Iraqi News Agency  correspondent in Sanaa today that the security forces last night  arrested one of the Saudi regime's agents after he blew up a  house in the area of Bajil, approximately 50 km east of the  eastern al-Hudaydah Governorate.    The source explained that the explosion killed one citizen  and wounded seven others. He also revealed that the security  authorities arrested three other saboteurs who confessed they  were recruited by the Saudi authorities to carry out bombings in  Yemen. They were arrested after their recent arrival from Saudi  Arabia, he added.</p>

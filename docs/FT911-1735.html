			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / International Company News: Smiths City Group placed in receivership NEW ZEALAND'S biggest chain of retail stores, Smiths City Group, has been placed into receivership after its bankers demanded repayment of NZDollars 45m (USDollars 26.5m). The chain of 90 stores has been closed, probably until Monday. The board has been endeavouring to restructure the company, and the chairman, Mr Bill Revell, condemned and rejected the bank's decision to force the receivership. But Mr Revell was pleased the receivers planned to continue the recovery plan under which the sale of the larger and profitable stores is proposed. The group has been under severe financial pressure since it acquired the North Island group, Smith &amp; Brown, in 1987. It paid a high price and faced an immediate downturn in trading. Recently, the company has had to close 20 stores. Since last year, secured debt has been cut from NZDollars 60m to NZDollars 45m, but the company has continued to struggle with falling retail sales, which was the reason the banks decided to put control into the hands of Price Waterhouse as receivers.</p>

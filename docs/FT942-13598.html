			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Arts: Pirouetting out of fashion - The ballerina seems to be a dying breed, laments Clement Crisp It is rather like calling a private soldier a general. When a dancing girl hits the headlines, the perkier journals invoke the word 'ballerina' - as in 'Ballerina in Royal love-nest mercy-dash'. The facts (to coin a phrase) will reveal that the 'ballerina' is no more than young Tiffany Plinth from the corps de ballet. But such is the resonance of this glamour-word that it has to be used to set the reader salivating. And, like gay and model and democratic, it is now almost meaningless. In those curious columns in the papers which tell us of people's birthdays every female dancer becomes a ballerina, and one, plainly in the grip of dementia praecox, annually declares herself 'prima ballerina assoluta'. But 'ballerina' still has meaning, as an honourable and thrilling identification of worth and artistry. Most ballet companies now call their leading dancers 'Principals'. One of the reasons I love the Paris Opera is that its first dancers are identified as etoiles and are starrily treated as such. Not so long ago, etoiles would refuse to share choreography with artists of lower rank in the elaborate Opera hierarchy, and I hope the female etoiles still have their own splendid dressing-rooms. (One that Makarova - now there was a ballerina] - used as guest at the Opera was like a suite in a good hotel.) Happily, there still are authentic and radiant ballerine to command our admiration, just as, in the heyday of ballerina-dom, their ancestresses ruled the 19th century stage in triumph, diamonds and a retinue of admirers. Then, the trappings of Grand Dukes and myriad bouquets (concealing gems, of course) were an extra manifestation of their identity as motive force for the ballet of their age. The old repertory we still cling to - the Petipa spectaculars - were hymns to the ballerina principal: without that glittering technical and emotional presence at their heart, they lacked focus. Today they look pointless if they are not given the same blaze of interpretation. And such is the popularity of the classics that far too many companies set out in these vehicles, with nice - oh, so nice - young women dancing the leading roles, and expect the public to accept them as Daimlers rather then the Robin Reliants they all too plainly are. It is a confidence trick played on the public, a duck-pond pretending to be Swan Lake. I have lately been watching two of today's most compelling ballerine, rightful heirs of the great tradition - Ludmila Semenyaka, touring as a guest with Scottish Ballet, and Elisabeth Platel of the Opera. Both exemplify the idea and ideal of a ballerina. Both are products of systems that know how to nourish this increasingly threatened breed. With Semenyaka's dancing we see the wisdom and the noble aspirations of Russian ballet. Exquisite physique has been refined by Petersburg training; in her performance as Aurora we see the grace of technical means and formal dignity that comes from rare talent enhanced by study with the greatest ballerine of earlier generations - Semenyaka, at the height of her powers, still consults Ulanova and Semyonova. Thus the disciplines of classicism free the dancing body and the interpretative soul. In Platel's art every virtue of the French style is plain: schooling that insists upon utmost elegance of statement, upon sweetest technical mastery, upon chic that polishes every movement, upon harmonies that are the heart of academic dancing. There result performances with a clarity and purity which tell of dance unalloyed and radiant, a parure of diamonds. Both artists have colleagues no less securely and splendidly ballerine. Training in Paris, in Petersburg and Moscow, its historical precedent and present understanding, seems to inspire generations of grandly gifted young women. Alas, I can think of few other worthy candidates for the ballerina accolade, though the first among them must be the lustrous, divinely musical Kyra Nichols with New York City Ballet. Is the ballerina a doomed species? The box office knows that the public still has the appetite for these stellar figures, and while the old repertory survives - despite the attentions of Frankenstein producers and designers - their place is secure. But the ballerina's world is shrinking, as less and less of today's choreography challenges or justifies her. The last choreographer to understand the ballerina was Sir Kenneth MacMillan. Romeo and Juliet, Manon, Anastasia, Isadora all extended the range of the three-act ballet, and hence of the ballerina's powers, and it was significant that MacMillan's final big work, The Prince of the Pagodas, identified the ballerina-potential of young Darcey Bussell, both on immediate choreographic terms, and in references to Sleeping Beauty and that classic's significance for the history of the Royal Ballet and its erst-while ballerine, from Fonteyn onwards. That MacMillan's three-act works are sought and staged throughout the world suggests how great is the public's appetite for works which show a ballerina in glory. She will survive; while ballet survives, she must survive. There is a duty for ballet companies and their schools to make sure she survives. Not to see the ballerina in full and tremendous cry (and step), is not to see ballet.</p>

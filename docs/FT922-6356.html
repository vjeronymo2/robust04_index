			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / Management (The Growing Business): New chapter for retailers  -In A Nutshell Small businesses might not think themselves natural winners of the Booker Prize, but if they are in the retailing or catering business, perhaps they should think again. The same group of companies that has been rewarding fiction writers is now doing the same for small businesses. The Booker Prize for Excellence in Retailing and Catering is open to businesses from restaurants to pubs, grocers and newsagents, all of which face sharp competition from the multiples or big brewers. The award, whose sponsors include Golden Wonder, Nestle and Bass, is worth Pounds 27,000 in prize money, although the organisers stress that consultancy advice is also offered to non-winning finalists. All shortlisted candidates can expect to be visited unannounced by shoppers and diners to make sure that customer service is as good as it is made out to be on the entrance form. Contact Booker Prize Office, Profile House, 2 Fazeley Street, Birmingham B5 5JP. Tel: 021 633 0672</p>

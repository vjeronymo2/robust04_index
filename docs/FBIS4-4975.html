			<p>BFN     [Text] Cambodia will adopt Malaysia's policy of  non-confrontation when dealing with neighboring countries on  sensitive issues. Its deputy premier, Prince Norodom Sirivut,  said his country respects the able and high leadership of Prime  Minister Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed in dealing with  neighbors. He said this at a news conference in Kuala Lumpur at  the end of his four-day official visit to Malaysia. In this  respect, he said Cambodia would not jeopardize its relations  with Thailand and Vietnam in efforts to resolve frontier  problems with the two neighbors. He said Cambodia would refer  the problems to the ASEAN foreign ministers meeting in Bangkok  in July. Cambodia has been invited to the meeting as a guest.  But he pointed out that Thailand should first stop harboring  the remnants of the Pol Pot guerrillas along the common border.    He also said Malaysian experience in the rubber and oil and  palm oil industries had always impressed Cambodia and his  country was eager to learn from Malaysia its experience in rural  development.</p>

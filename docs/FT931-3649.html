			<p>930315 FT  15 MAR 93 / Lords set to attack union fee proposals PRESSURE on the government to modify its plans to change the check-off arrangements through which trade union subscriptions are deducted automatically from employees' pay will intensify this week. Tomorrow the House of Lords will have its first chance to amend the government's union reform legislation. Under proposals outlined in the bill, employees would have to indicate their continuing approval of the arrangement every three years. At present there is no obligation to indicate approval. Both Labour and Tory peers have put down changes to the government's proposal, reflecting disquiet about the move from unions and employers alike. The point was the one on which the government came closest to making a concession when the bill was discussed by MPs. Many at Westminster believe it will not survive unchanged during the line-by-line consideration of the bill in the Lords which starts tomorrow and continues over the next few weeks. Ministers are determined not to shift on the point of principle that approval of check-off arrangements by employees would have to be renewed, but they may be forced to make renewal last for longer than three years. Another point that has concerned employers is the proposed greater freedom for individuals to choose the union they join. The government believes it can defuse criticism over the move by underlining that the measure would not affect single-union deals because the law would not introduce new requirements about recognition of unions. Cross-party alliances among peers on aspects of the maternity provisions will also test the government's handling of the legislation. This new set of likely difficulties for ministers in the Lords comes as the government still faces disquiet from Tory peers over its plans for property leasehold laws. Discussion of the Housing Bill resumes in the House of Lords today. But over the leasehold reform provisions the government can rely on support from Labour and Liberal Democrats to save it from defeat by Tory rebels who want to restrict the new rights for long-leaseholders. The common ground on some issues between employers and unions over the planned union reforms is a much more serious threat to the Conservative majority in the Lords.</p>

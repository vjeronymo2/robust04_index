			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Barranquilla--Two of the country's largest mining  projects could be transferred to the private sector. The  government has expressed its support for privatizing Colombian  Coal (CARBOCOL) and selling off its stock in the Cerromatoso  nickel mine.    According to Mines and Energy Minister Guido Nule Aming, as  a  result of the government reform of a year ago that led to the  creation of the Colombian Coal Enterprise (ECOCARBON), CARBOCOL  was left managing no more than Colombia's share of El Cerrejon.  Furthermore, since it was capitalized, it is now on a sound  footing.    Nonetheless, the minister said that the enterprise is no  more  profitable because prices on the international coal market are  far below initial projections.    The government is therefore weighing the possibility of  reorganizing the enterprise, hoping to bring in the private  sector. "We have ordered a number of studies that are measuring  all these possibilities on a national and world level. In my  opinion, it would be very useful for us to privatize CARBOCOL  totally. It is essentially a marketing activity in which the  government has no reason to be involved."    Concerning Cerromatoso, in which the Industrial Development  Institute has an important interest, the minister said there is  no justification for the involvement of the latter organization  either.    Nule presided over a meeting of the Urra, Inc. board of  directors in Barranquilla that passed a budget totaling 48  billion pesos for 1994. The figure does not include any of the  loans granted, the first of which would go to the Electric  Corporation of the Atlantic Coast (CORELCA).    Urra Manager Jose Camilo Manzur said this year's first goal  involves social programs, the purchase of nationally owned  lands, and the relocation of people, without neglecting other  matters such as the signing of loan contracts and progress on  civil engineering projects already under way.    The government is bent on promoting the program to privatize  several entities. The list will include such banks as the Bank  of Colombia, the National Bank, and the People's Bank, and power  plants such as the Betania Hydroelectric Plant.    The Executive Branch believes it should allow the  participation of the private sector in the activities in which  it engages.</p>

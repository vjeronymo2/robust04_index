			<p>BFN     [Text] The parliamentary bloc of the Yemeni Socialist Party  [YSP] issued a statement in which it expressed its regret and  resentment over the statement issued today by the House of  Representatives which represented the secessionist congress and  al-Islah blocs, and has no connection with the Constitution.  The statement said that the House of Representatives is to be  used to justify the war declared by 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, the  motives of which hide the secessionist lenience [as heard] of  the forces which rejected the convention document and the  national dialogue, and instead declared the war by attacking a  number of brigades in the northern governorates.    The statement said that the declaration of the war by 'Ali  'Abdallah Salih and his military dynasty, supported by the House  of Representatives, is a disaster to our people. The statement  declared the boycott of the meeting of the House of  Representatives and suspended the membership until it rectifies  its stand.</p>

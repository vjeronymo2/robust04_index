			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / Private View: The little sister and the lost brother IN HER retirement Margaret Ramsey is writing the life of her brother: not of Michael, the bushy-browed Archbishop of Canterbury, but of Frank, the clever one, who died at the age of 26. Frank Ramsey was not merely clever. He was a mathematics prodigy whose work in philosophy at Cambridge in the Twenties has raised him, in some eyes, above Bertrand Russell and Ludwig Wittgenstein. Ramsey was a physical giant (he stood 6ft 3ins. and weighed over 16 stone) who threw open windows in mathematics, logic and economics. At the age of 18 he translated Wittgenstein's Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus and later he supervised the irascible Austrian, 14 years his senior, for his PhD. At the age of 21 he was helping the 52-year-old Russell to revise Principia Mathematica. His paper on the theory of saving was described by Keynes as 'one of the most remarkable contributions to mathematical economics ever made.' It was as if, said Keynes after the prodigy's death in 1930, Ramsey had absorbed in the nursery everything then being discussed or written at Trinity College. For his sister, who was 12 when Frank died from jaundice, it has been a painful yet liberating journey. It was not the first nor last tragedy in her life: two years before, her mother had been killed when her father crashed the car. 'I had almost a complete black-out for those two years,' she said this week. 'The first thing I remember after my mother's death was my sister appearing on the doorstep of the boarding house where I was at school in Winchester in floods of tears saying that Frank had died. 'These two deaths completely upset me. I couldn't accept them. I was just full of hatred. I didn't feel any grief, just sort of fury and hatred. 'But then gradually I drifted - I was still a child - into a state of feeling I had somehow to continue him. First of all, at school, I did it by playing his records. He was very fond of music, particularly Beethoven quartets. 'Then, I'd been going to read English at Newnham and suddenly at the last minute I decided I'd do philosophy. I don't know why at all, but I'm quite sure it had to do with Frank. 'So I read philosophy under very queer illusions about him. I wasn't a conceited person about my brain. I was what you might call ordinary clever. (She got a First, even so, went on to study economics and taught the subject at Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford). But all the time I had this feeling that I had to continue Frank's work. I knew it was a madness, but it gripped me nevertheless. I remember saying 'Oh, well, if I get a First I'll be in the same class as Frank and continuing him in some way.'' She continued him in another way, by marrying a clever philosopher called George Paul. 'My husband was a continuation of Frank because he was by far the cleverest young philosopher at Cambridge when I was there. He also sort of inherited Frank's wit and kindness. He was very like him in many ways.' They married in 1938 and had four girls: Helen, Elizabeth, Kathleen and Anne. Then disaster struck again. While the girls were still in their teens, their father died of a heart attack after a sailing accident on Lake Coniston. 'We all suffered terribly and it took a very long time before any of them could marry. And this was hard on all of us.' Although fond of her brother Michael, she found him difficult. According to his former press secretary, Michael De-La-Noy, the future Primate of All England was a strange clumsy, messy and irritating youth with a habit of suddenly jumping up and running round in circles. He was generous to Margaret in her widowhood, sending her money to put a daughter through Bedale's School. Yet he was distant. 'Michael couldn't bear sisters, even as a young man. My sister and I were very sad about that. We were quite fond of him but he simply couldn't relate to us.' But with Frank she felt a real identity. They looked alike when young and shared a sense of humour. So she worried about how to deal with her brother's love life. 'It's like spying on someone you're fond of and spilling the beans. Now that fear has gone. It's become what you might call a technical problem.' Though intellectually precocious, Frank was emotionally immature and very dependent on their mother, Agnes. An infatuation with a married woman had him going off to Vienna, as was fashionable then, to be psychoanalysed (and talk to Wittgenstein). Encouraged by his mother, he married Lettice Baker (later a well-known photographer) when he was 22 but then fell in love with a friend of hers, Elizabeth Denby. 'The mix-ups in his marriage made him very unhappy,' said his sister. 'He was sort of tormented between the two of them for the rest of his life. He couldn't give up either of them.' Lettice had two daughters: Jane, a biochemist, who is still alive and Sarah 'an exceptionally gifted and happy person' who, like her father, died very suddenly while an undergraduate at Newnham. Margaret Ramsey has unearthed some of the proceedings of the secretive Apostles, the small, exclusive discussion society to which the famous Cambridge names belonged. Frank was a keen member, and did not miss a meeting for over two years. 'It was his social life,' she said. 'He was not entirely easy with people unless they were on the same wavelength as him.' But the records are unhelpful: the subjects of discussion were concealed by jokey resolutions voted on at the end. One such was 'Has Frank taughtoise?', another 'Should Frank laugh again?'. (The Ramsey laugh was famous). Frank's reputation has continued to grow and there has been speculation about what he might have achieved had he lived. His sister finds the adulation overdone and the speculation meaningless: 'You can't forecast what original work someone might have done]' A big admirer is Hugh Mellor, the present Professor of Philosophy at Cambridge, who has described Ramsey as the most brilliant of his contemporaries. Yet Prof. Mellor has strongly discouraged Margaret from writing a biography. 'I don't know why. He sort of 'owns' Frank. I suspect he feels he's the one who discovered this genius.' I suggested she might be seen as the adoring little sister, unable to write a critical life. Was she going to elevate Frank still further? 'No, not in the least. This interests me, this difficulty. Yes, he was a very much loved person. He was thought to have a very good nature, to be a very good man. I have to see through the obituaries in a way.' If there were to be criticism what would it be? 'Ah. Well, he was very intolerant of people he thought fools. He didn't understand people very well. He inherited a sort of kindness and warmth from Mother, but he was constantly surprised about things in human nature. I'm not suggesting he was unique in this. But if one's digging out defects, that is one of them. 'Michael praised him to the skies in later years but Frank used to say things like 'Michael became a clergyman because he was too stupid to do anything else.'' After the death of her father - a mathematician who became President of Magdalene College - Michael burned every letter in the house. 'Goodness knows why. But I remember him now making a great bonfire at the end of the garden.' The father, Arthur, seems to have been an austere figure, a man of high standards who worked obsessively, fearing he would die and leave his wife in poverty. He did not believe a woman could be both feminine and successful. 'He used to refer to Biddy (her sister Bridget), who was perhaps a bit less bright than the other three, as the fool of the family. She was very pretty but she went through life hampered by feeling stupid. It was all nonsense: she trained as a doctor. 'And I went through life having great difficulty in feeling pretty enough. I found it very difficult to be feminine because Father felt that I wasn't' Has this biography given you pain, or pleasure? 'Both. Large quantities of both.' What are the painful bits? 'Mostly a feeling of inadequacy, that I can't make a good job of it. I have left it rather late and my memory has got very poor.' And the pleasurable aspects? 'When I get a bit right I feel frightfully pleased - and some of the discoveries.' Has it stirred up painful recollections? 'Yes, I've wept quite a few times reading old things, particularly the deaths. His death can easily move me to tears now. But I don't, in a curious way, count that as pain because it's worthwhile.' It's more like mourning? 'Yes. After all, I didn't cry when he died because I was so resentful of him dying and I was rather traumatised by my mother's death. So it's a sort of relief. Yes, certainly.' Has it helped you come to terms with the tragedies in your life? 'They become part of you. In a way you recover, but they do become part of you. But yes, I think it has. I think I feel better in myself through doing it.' I thanked her for the interview. 'Well, I've enjoyed it actually. It's quite like writing the book. There's a certain liberation in talking about oneself.'</p>

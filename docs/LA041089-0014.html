			<p><P> April 10, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: STAGE  </P> <P> In what was billed by Minnesota Gov. Rudy Perpich as "precedent-setting  cultural diplomacy," the Minneapolis-based Children's Theatre Company has  joined forces with the Children's Art Theatre of Shanghai to produce a play.  Plans call for an American playwright to write a play about the impact of  China's Cultural Revolution and reforms on traditional values. It will be  produced first at the Children's Theatre Company in September, 1990, and then  at the Shanghai company in November 1990. After the run of the two individual  productions, the casts will be integrated for a joint staging, which will tour  the Asian Pacific with stops in Gagzhou, Hong Kong, Beijing, Tokyo and T'ai  Pei. Both productions will be directed by Jon Cranney, artistic director of the  Minneapolis group. The Minneapolis theater group already has a two-year  exchange with Moscow's Central Children's Theatre, where Cranney is directing  "The Adventures of Tom Sawyer."

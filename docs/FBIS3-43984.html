			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Australian Foreign Minister Gareth Evans says there  is a growing momentum for peace in Somalia. Senator Evans made  his comment during a one-day visit to Somalia where he held  surprise talks with Somali warlord Mohamed Farah Aidid and rival  Ali Mahdi. His visit comes as several other countries prepare to  withdraw from the United Nations Operation in Somalia [UNOSOM].  But Senator Evans told James Schofield that Australia had no  intention of pulling out.    [Begin recording] [Evans, in progress] Well, it is a  slightly surreal experience to meet someone like General Aidid  against the background of what has happened over last 12 months,  but I had a long hour and a bit with him in Nairobi and I have  met with Ali Mahdi here in Mogadishu. But I have to say that I  am reasonably encouraged by the outcome of those discussions  because if they are to be taken at face value, what they're  saying is that they are both very much committed to consensus  and compromise and there is plenty of objective evidence around  the place that the pressures are building up for them to engage  in such a consensual compromise approach.    [Schofield] What can you take at the face value? After all,  wouldn't it suit Gen. Aidid's purpose, for example, to lay low  until the Americans have gone?    [Evans] Well, all I can say is that there is a very  widespread perception here being communicated to me by all sorts  of people -- presidents of neighboring countries, UNOSOM  personnel, others active [word indistinct] on the ground here --  that the people are really fed up to the teeth with the  suffering that they have experienced and they are putting  pressure on the political leadership of the respective clans to  find this kind of accommodation. Each of them, I think, knows  because of the messages they're getting loudly and clearly from  the international community -- and I repeated those myself --  that they can't expect recognition and financial support or any  other support from the international community if they win power  by force of arms. They know that there is a huge relief and  rehabilitation job still ahead of the country and the only way  that is going to be achievable and they are going to keep their  own popular support is by engaging in a process of political  compromise.    [Schofield] When the U.S. pulls out they're going take most  of the effective communications and, for example, casualty  evacuation support services with them, which will  considerably...which will leave the UN position considerably  weaker, wouldn't you agree?    [Evans] Well, there will still be something over 20,000  troops here and still very substantial backup for them and even  in the worst case analyses in terms of other possible drawdowns  of troop-contributor involvement, we're still talking about  fifteen, sixteen thousand. I know that doesn't produce the  capacity for really activist-interventionist military operation,  that is still a pretty substantial security (?blanket). I mean,  all sorts of things are possible where there is a will to  achieve it in this situation.    All I can say generally in Somalia is that I had expected to  find an absolute nightmare here. It is certainly not a dream  run, but it is a better situation than what I had anticipated.  [end recording]</p>

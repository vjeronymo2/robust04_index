			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / Commonwealth calls for withdrawal of foreign forces and settlers from Cyprus Commonwealth leaders called for 'the speedy withdrawal of all foreign forces and settlers' from Cyprus and expressed 'grave concern over the continued influx of Turkish settlers'. But although the toughly worded statement went on to condemn what it called 'the negative attitude of the Turkish Cypriot side' to recent United Nations 'confidence building measures', it proposed no new initiatives. However, if no progress were made, said the communique, the Commonwealth would 'fully support' Security Council consideration of unspecified 'alternative ways' to implement Council resolutions on Cyprus.</p>

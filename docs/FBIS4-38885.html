			<p>BFN     [Text] If Vasil Novikaw, secretary of the Central  Committee of the Party of Communists of Belarus [PKB], wins the  presidential election, certain economic reforms will be halted  -- namely, the privatization of housing and industrial  enterprises by means of vouchers. This was stated by Syarhey  Kalyakin, secretary of the PKB Central Committee, at a news  conference held by the PKB leadership. According to Kalyakin,  Vasil Novikaw will participate in the first round of the  elections -- this has been decided by the PKB Central Committee.  Kalyakin also noted that "if the situation changes, it will not  be ruled out that Novikaw could form a bloc with one of the  following three candidates -- Kebich, Dubko, or Lukashenka.  Such a bloc is by no means possible with Paznyak or Shushkevich.    Commenting on the slogan of his presidential campaign -- "To  return to the people that which they have been deprived" --  Vasil Novikaw stated that "in the first place, it is necessary  to restore social guarantees and rights which were achieved  during the Soviet period. It is necessary to return to a great,  powerful state, great friendship among the people, and real  people's democracy." The presidential candidate called the  presidency "a foreign body in Slav civilization" and noted that  given a victory of left forces at the presidential and  parliamentary elections, it would be quite possible to propose  eliminating the presidency. Novikaw stated that as of today, he  has almost completed his team for changing the current  government in the event of his election victory. However,  according to Novikaw, even now, the government includes  "specialists and honest people whom we know and will keep at  their posts."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Fanos Konstandinidhis] </F>   [Excerpts] President Glavkos Kliridhis will begin briefing  the political leaders tomorrow on what has been discussed during  the confidence-building measures [CBM's] proximity talks, where  no progress has been made whatsoever.    The reason is because Rauf Denktas rejected President  Kliridhis' proposal on setting up a schedule for the return of  all the residents to the fenced-off part of Famagusta in  conjunction with the reopening of the Nicosia Airport and for  safe access from and to Famagusta. The Kliridhis proposal  includes the withdrawal of the occupation troops to the east of  the Dherinia Road so that there will not be any danger of  enclaving the Varosha residents. [passage omitted]    A senior government source told I MAKHI yesterday that at  the  next session of the talks President Kliridhis will reiterate the  same positions about Famagusta, Nicosia Airport, and safe access  to the fenced-off area of Famagusta. The same source added that  these issues are of substantial importance to the Greek Cypriot  side. This is why there is not going to be any retreat, the  source stressed.    The same source also noted that the Greek Government has  been  fully briefed on the results of the first phase of the talks.  President Kliridhis, the source added, will convene a meeting of  the National Council after the second phase of the talks is  concluded at the end of February.    At any rate, the Cyprus Government and the political leaders  in general do not expect any "spectacular" developments in the  new phase of the talks either. What is expected to happen after  Rauf Denktas' return from Ankara -- where he will go tomorrow  and return on Wednesday -- is that he will make some new  maneuvers and then again block the course of discussion by  reiterating the same positions, particularly on Famagusta, which  is the key to developments.    At the same time, backstage diplomats, particularly the  British and Americans, have begun again to move actively in an  attempt to overcome the deadlock. Their efforts will also be  focused on Ankara on the occasion of the Turkish Cypriot leaders  visit there. To break the deadlock, U.S. Ambassador in Nicosia  Richard Boucher and British High Commissioner David Dain  received instructions to begin intensive consultations with the  two sides. It is also rumored that U.S. Special Cyprus  Coordinator Robert Lamb will be coming to Nicosia during these  days to assist in the consultations.    The purpose of the new diplomatic moves is to attempt, in  the  event that it is impossible to end the deadlock, to find a  formula on the basis of which Mr. Kliridhis and Mr. Denktas will  meet with UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali in New York for  two-three days to hold a "general" discussion. On the basis of  this formula, the British and Americans hope that the proximity  talks, of which they are "sponsors," will continue.    At any rate, the experiment of the proximity talks and the  CBM's seems to be failing. [passage omitted]</p>

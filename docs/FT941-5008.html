			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / Focus on Charles Redman, US special envoy to Bosnia Mr Charles Redman, 50, the US special envoy to the region appointed last August, and now the pivotal player in the peace process, spends his time commuting between Zagreb, Sarajevo, Serbia and Vienna, where Bosnian Croats and Moslems and Croatian officials are trying to put flesh on a preliminary federal plan for Bosnia, writes Judy Dempsey. 'When he first sat in on the Geneva talks, I think he was overwhelmed by the complexity of the issues,' a senior UN official said. 'He listened. He learned. Washington could get its fingers burnt just like the Europeans.' Mr Redman is trying to avoid this by making sure no lines are crossed. He is on the phone constantly to Mr Vitaly Churkin, Russia's envoy to the former Yugoslavia, the German Foreign Ministry, and the UN. 'Redman wants to capitalise on the momentum for peace. If it comes, he'll have a hard time convincing Congress to send ground troops to keep that peace,' a US diplomat said. Sceptics believe Mr Redman, former ambassador to Sweden and state department spokesman, does not have enough political clout, but he leans on his contacts at the intelligence department of the US air force and at Nato, where he served in the 1970s and 1980s respectively.</p>

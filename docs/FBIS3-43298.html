Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation -- ANC military  wing; MK] Chief of Staff Siphiwe Nyanda says March must be the  target date for the establishment of a multiparty force. John  Matham has the details:    The establishment of a national peace keeping force will be  discussed at the first meeting of the Law and Order Sub-Council  of the Transitional Executive Council. There is some skepticism  that the force could be set up and properly trained prior to  April. A government source has told the BUSINESS DAY newspaper  that the idea of creating a force is, in his words, dead in the  water for political and logistical reasons. The government is  concerned about the wisdom of deploying a poorly trained force  in tense areas. But Nyanda insists that the force will replace  the SAP [South African Police], especially the Internal  Stability Unit, in dealing with political violence. Nyanda says  the force will consist of about 10,000 men who will be selected  from recruits who gather at assembly points.</p>

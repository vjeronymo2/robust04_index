			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / International Company News: Operating profit ahead Western Mining Corporation, the large minerals and metals group which has faced a series of adverse legal settlements recently, yesterday announced a 25.1 per cent increase in operating profits after tax, on an equity-consolidated basis, to ADollars 66.3m (USDollars 47.6m), in the half year to end-December, writes Nikki Tait. After abnormal items, the figure for the first six months stood at ADollars 56.3m, up from ADollars 34.6m in the same period of 1992-1993. Total revenues were 3.3 per cent lower at ADollars 779.8m. The large part of the improvement was due to a higher contribution to profits from WMC's 48.25 per cent interest in Alcoa of Australia, which contributed ADollars 89.6m, compared with ADollars 56.5m last time. The company acknowledged that Alcoa's contribution was likely to fall 'significantly' - perhaps halve - in 1994, but said any reduction 'should be offset by increased profitability from nickel and copper' assuming a 'reasonable' recovery in prices of these metals in 1994. Although commodity prices were weak in the first half, WMC claimed that it was 'in an excellent position to take advantage of the upturn . . . which seems to be under way'. Nickel capacity had been 'substantially' increased and unit costs reduced. Unit costs of gold sales should also fall in the second half. The interim dividend, it added, was going up by a third, to 4 cents a share.</p>

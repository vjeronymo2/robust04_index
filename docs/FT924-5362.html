			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Premier Jasray makes new appeal for emergency aid Mongolia's prime minister, Mr Puntsagiyn Jasray, has made a new appeal for emergency aid, saying his country needs Dollars 20m (Pounds 13m) to make it through this winter, Reuter reports from Ulan Bator. The money would be used to pay for imports of Russian petroleum products, heating oil among them. Mongolia (which celebrated its national day yesterday) imports all its fuel from Russia, but economic difficulties associated with its transition to a market economy have wiped out hard currency reserves. Mr Jasray said his government would appeal for aid at an emergency meeting to be held next Monday in Washington. Japan, the US and Germany are expected to attend with officials from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Mongolian officials say donors will not be asked for new pledges, but for faster disbursement of aid.</p>

			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / Business and the Environment: Arguing against tree tax A timber tax, suggested in London last month by Ioannis Paleokrassas, the European Union's environment commissioner, could be environmentally destructive, leading economists argue. Paleokrassas, who wants a tax to discriminate between timber from virgin and cultivated forests to help preserve native forests, has not yet taken steps to make the proposal formal. But Brazilian and Scandinavian timber producers have condemned his suggestion as potentially protectionist. They claimed, too, that the largest producers do not take wood from virgin forests and that a tax is unnecessary. Richard Sandbrook, director of the International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED), a respected London-based think-tank, says that such a tax might 'reduce the incentives for sustainable timber management'. The heart of the IIED's criticism was set out in a report commissioned by the International Tropical Timber Organisation last year, and written by Ed Barbier, now a lecturer at York University. The report says that, in the short term, a tax would cut a timber-producing country's earnings. It might then encourage it to increase timber exports to countries not imposing a tax to maintain its level of foreign exchange earnings. In the longer term, a tax would cut producers' profitability and might encourage them to convert forests - cultivated and virgin - to other uses, they say. Resistance to a proposed tax is hardly surprising. But EU countries have been increasingly vocal in criticising Brussels for ignoring the impact of environmental measures on industrial competitiveness. The recent near-bankruptcy of the German packaging recycling schemes is also a reminder of how unpredictable the results of ill-thought out policies can be.</p>

			<p><P> December 24, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAPAN PREDICTS AN EASING OF GROWTH FROM 5.2% TO 3.8%;  </P> <P> ECONOMY: THE 1991-92 FISCAL YEAR ALSO WILL SEE A NARROWING OF ITS TRADE SURPLUS  AND A 9.2% SURGE IN IMPORTS, THE GOVERNMENT FORECASTS.  </P> <P> Japan is forecasting slower economic growth and small declines in its trade and  balance of payments surpluses in the fiscal year starting April 1.  </P> <P> The government predicted Saturday that gross national product would grow 3.8%  in real terms in 1991-92 after rising 5.2% in the current year.  </P> <P> Japan's trade surplus is expected to narrow to around $56 billion next fiscal  year from an estimated $57 billion this year. The surplus in the current  account of its balance of payments is seen shrinking to about $30 billion from  around $32 billion.  </P> <P> "Japan's economy, although slowing a bit, will keep growing next fiscal year,  led by domestic demand," said an official of the Economic Planning Agency,  which released the forecasts.  </P> <P> He said the economy, which entered its fifth year of expansion this month, was  likely to enjoy its longest post-war growth period. The longest boom previously  was 57 months -- from November, 1965, to July, 1970.  </P> <P> Economic planning officials said Japan's exports are expected to rise about 7%  to $305 billion in 1991-92 from $285 billion in 1990-91, while imports are  expected to swell by about 9.2% to $249 billion from $228 billion.  </P> <P> The government forecast that consumer prices would rise 2.4% in 1991-92 after  increasing 3.1% this fiscal year. But it said wholesale prices will drop 0.1%  -- due mainly to the yen's continued strength -- after rising 2% in 1990-91.  </P> <P> Unemployment is expected to average 2.2% in 1991-92, unchanged from 1990-91.  The government expects industrial production to rise 4.1% after growing 5.5%  this year.  </P> <P> The forecasts are based on the assumption that the Gulf crisis will be resolved  with no major military conflict and that oil prices will average $25 per  barrel. It also assumes an average dollar/yen exchange rate of 128.10 yen. The  dollar is currently at around 135 yen.  </P> <P> Officials said domestic demand should remain strong, led by consumer spending  and corporate capital investment.  </P> <P> The government forecast expects consumer spending to grow by a real 4.1% in  1991-92 after rising 4.2% this year, while capital spending should increase  6.8% after growing 11.7%.  </P> <P> But private housing investment, hurt by higher domestic interest rates, will  likely contract by 2.7% in 1991-92 after rising 8.4% in 1990-91, the forecast  said.  </P> <P> The government said domestic demand would contribute four percentage points to  real growth in gross national product during 1991-92, but external demand would  trim growth by 0.2 percentage points.  </P> <P> In the current fiscal year, domestic demand will contribute 5.5 percentage  points to real growth, while external demand will slow economic expansion by  0.3 points, the officials said.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee from the SEC's Public Reference Branch. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Representations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Each of the Funds is a registered open-end management investment company that is authorized to issue shares in series. The existing series of the Funds are money market funds. One of the Funds and the series thereof are designed exclusively for institutional investors, particularly banks seeking investment of assets on behalf of fiduciary or trust accounts. Lehman Brothers Global Asset Management Inc. serves as investment adviser to the Funds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The number of outstanding shares of each Fund can fluctuate significantly, even on a daily basis, particularly for those sold to institutions. From time to time, the number of shares held of record by a bank in a master account for its agency or fiduciary accounts could exceed 5% of a Fund's outstanding voting shares. In that case, the Fund would become an Affiliated person of the bank and the prohibitions of section 17 would apply. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Applicants seek an exemption from sections 17(a) and 17(e)(1) to permit the Funds to engage in certain transactions with ``Affiliated Banks.'' For purposes of this application, ``Affiliated Banks'' are banks, bank holding companies, or affiliated persons thereof that are affiliated persons of the Funds  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> solely <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  because they: (a) Directly or indirectly own, control, or hold with the power to vote 5% of the outstanding voting securities of any of the Funds; or (b) act as investment adviser to any of the Funds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. The exemption from section 17(a) would permit the Funds to purchase both long and short-term U.S. government securities from Affiliated Banks that act as primary dealers in these securities. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  The exemption from section 17(a) also would permit a Fund to enter into repurchase agreement transactions with, or purchase short-term obligations issued by, an Affiliated Bank, provided that all such securities meet the credit standards set forth in condition 1 below (``Qualified Securities''). The exemption from section 17(e)(1) would permit an Affiliated Bank, acting as an agent for any Fund in connection with the purchase or sale of U.S. government securities or tax-exempt obligations, to accept compensation that would be permitted a broker under the limitations of section 17(e)(2). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> As used in the application, the term U.S. government securities are securities that are guaranteed as to payment of principal and interest by the U.S. government or its agencies or instrumentalities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Primary dealers in U.S. government securities are dealers that are permitted to deal directly with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. In purchasing and selling U.S. government securities, it is critical that the Funds obtain prompt execution of their transactions at a competitive cost. Each primary dealer is a major factor in the U.S. government securities market. If the Fund cannot trade with one or more primary dealers, the Funds may be deprived of the most favorable price and execution as against other dealers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Applicants believe that the elimination of even a few major banks from the universe of money market instrument issuers and dealers with whom the Funds may do business would have a noticeable impact on portfolio management flexibility. Each issuer of Qualified Securities contributes to the depth and liquidity of the market for short-term obligations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Commercial banks are important factors in the municipal bond dealer community, particularly in the general obligation area. The municipal bond market is more disparate, much less structured, and considerably less liquid than the market for money market instruments. As a result, much greater reliance is placed on the dealer community to keep portfolio managers apprised of, and to supply the Funds with, suitable issues of municipal securities, as well as to assist in the disposition of portfolio securities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. The Funds' board of directors, trustees, or managing general partners will be responsible for adopting and monitoring appropriate methods to ensure that the price and terms of transactions in U.S. government securities and Qualified Securities will be reasonable and fair to participating Funds. In evaluating the fairness and reasonableness of transactions in U.S. government securities, a Fund or its investment adviser will obtain and document competitive quotations from at least one other dealer. In evaluating the fairness and reasonableness of transactions in Qualified Securities, applicants may use a matrix pricing system to assess the price offered by the Affiliated Bank relative to market transactions involving comparable securities. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> A matrix pricing system uses market data from transactions involving securities having comparable ratings, credit quality, maturity, collateral, amortization and other relevant terms to evaluate the price of a security. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / Equity Markets: Wall Street looks beyond next rate rise - New York With the next rate increase all but assured, Wall Street is beginning to calculate how much more the Federal Reserve will have to tighten credit conditions to bring growth down to a manageable pace. On Friday, the Commerce Department announced that the economy had expanded at an annual rate of 3.4 per cent in the third quarter, much higher than the most recent estimates. Over the past week, economists had lifted their forecasts to around 3.0 per cent in response to the recent series of robust indicators. While the reported figure represents a slowdown from the second quarter, when the economy accelerated at a 4.1 per cent rate, the Fed is not likely to be satisfied. Thus, the data merely closed one chapter and opened another. 'It's a foregone conclusion that the Fed is going to raise rates a half point at its next meeting on November 15. The real issue now is whether the Fed is going to raise rates again afterwards,' says Mr Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany in New York, 'That makes for a very uneasy, restive kind of environment,' he says. But if there is a sense of uncertainty dominating the equity markets, it was surely not apparent immediately after the GDP announcement. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped more than 55 points, to close the week at 3,930.66. The positive movement was partly explained by the hammering blue chips had taken in five of the previous six sessions. The rebound came after a steady stream of strong earnings news which had flooded into Wall Street over the past fortnight. As of last week, 20 per cent of companies had reported profits 10 per cent or more above the consensus, according to SG Warburg. Most importantly, bonds were surprisingly co-operative, with the yield on the benchmark 30-year issue dipping below 8.00 per cent, a level viewed as a psychological obstacle for stocks. On Friday, fixed-rate investors took solace in a third-quarter dip in the implicit price deflator, a keenly watched measure of inflation, and suggestions that the headline GDP figure was boosted by inventory accumulation. As a consequence, Mr Robert Brusca, chief economist for Nikko Securities, says the Fed would have difficulty justifying a rate increase after its expected move around November 15. Investors are already looking for further evidence to support such a conclusion. They will not have long to wait because this week brings two of the most crucial pieces of economic data in the monthly release cycle. The National Association of Purchasing Management will publish its October survey of business activity tomorrow, while the Labor Department's report on employment conditions is due on Friday.</p>

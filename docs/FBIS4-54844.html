			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ivan Jakovcic, president of the Istrian </F> Democratic Congress, by Davor Ivankovic; place and date not  given: "We Want Counties After Radic's Model"]    [Text] At the time of the most severe crisis so far  between Istria and the central state authorities, the Fifth  Special Convention of the Istrian Democratic Congress [IDS], the  number one Istrian party, was held in Rovinj. At the  convention, four declarations were issued that will become IDS  program material and in which the main IDS regionalist  orientations are listed. It is clear from the text of the  declarations that the IDS has taken a new, clearer, and more  open course toward the accomplishment of the autonomy of Istria.  We talked about this with the party president Ivan  Jakovcic.    [Ivankovic] Why was the Fifth IDS Convention a special  convention?    [Jakovcic] Because the regular ones are held every two  years, and this one was programmatic. The IDS has adopted many  important documents relating to our specific political aim. The  most important thing is that it was a dignified meeting of  people who hold similar views and who want good for our state.  Those who expected a spectacular development of events at this  convention, and who, even before it took place, threatened  Istria with the army and police, are now politically defeated in  this area.  <H5>  This Is Not Autonomism </H5>   [Ivankovic] Many will say that the declarations you have  adopted (on Istria being a European region, on the autonomous  County of Istria, on the democratization of the Republic of  Croatia, and on the regional organization of the Republic of  Croatia) display clear and evident autonomism.    [Jakovcic] This has nothing to do with autonomism, because  autonomism is a concept of political activities aimed at  breaking up a state, whereas we are building Croatia and  proposing a new vision of Croatia to the citizens of Croatia.  If Croatia were organized through its historical regions of  Istria, Dalmatia, Slavonia and Baranja, Medjimurje, Zagorje,  Lika, and so on, it would be completely normal if these regions  had a certain status. Some regions could have autonomy, and  some could have other statuses, instead of what the Croatian  authorities have, judging by indications, agreed to, which is  the confederalization of Croatia, and which it has been forced  into because it was incapable of forming a different territorial  organization. The autonomy of the individual, a group, a town,  region, or municipality is something that is based on  subsidiarity, which is the basis of Christian democracy. Those  who wish to call themselves a Christian democratic party in  Croatia do not in fact understand what it means.    [Ivankovic] One gets the impression that, by adopting the  declarations, you have achieved what you had not dared even put  into the suspended Statute. What is the formal and legal  significance of these documents?    [Jakovcic] The declarations are the expression of our  political wishes, of our will; they are the expression of what  we intend to achieve through the institutions of the system.  There are no possibilities and there is no need for the IDS to  proclaim anything or do anything independently as long as the  democratic system is in power. As long as the Croatian  Parliament, the government, and the president are functioning,  there will be democratic institutes, which are what goals should  be achieved through. This is the direction our proposals for  constitutional laws, built on the basis of these declarations,  follow. We have observed the democratic procedure. Naturally,  our proposals for constitutional laws will be put on the agenda  of the Croatian Parliament only when the majority in the  Croatian Parliament is behind our proposal. Therefore, with  these documents we followed what we presented to President  Tudjman at Brijuni late last summer, except now the highest IDS  group stands behind them.  <H5>  The Constitution Once and Now... </H5>   [Ivankovic] These documents now state in writing your  demands for a region, not county, for legislative power, most of  the direct revenue....    [Jakovcic] Naturally. These proposals ensue from two basic  postulates -- getting to know about the European organization  and the desire to organize Croatia after the model of Austrian  and Italian regions, which is still far from the achievements of  the German and Swiss types of federalism. The most beautiful  caryatid of this idea is based on [Stjepan] Radic's treatment of  Croatian counties, on his text of the Constitution dating from  the early Twenties, in which he anticipates the counties to, I  quote, "pass regulations that have the validity of laws." We  must oppose those who now want to suspend Radic's positions!    [Ivankovic] However, everything you are demanding  contradicts the existing Croatian Constitution.    [Jakovcic] The declarations we have adopted do not have this  Croatian Constitution as a starting point. Our task, as the  task of any other political party, is to fight for the  achievement of our political aims in a democratic way. On the  other hand, a change of the Constitution and the laws is to be  expected, and this is our political aim, but it is not the only  one. We are also asking for the change of the  super-presidential political system; we want a parliamentary  system in which the parliament and the government will have  autonomy.  <H5>  We Want Early Elections </H5>   [Ivankovic] It would be difficult to expect that your party  will ever be in power in Croatia, except maybe in a coalition.  Have you discussed these programmatic wishes with possible  party partners in Croatia, and have they supported them?    [Jakovcic] We have recently witnessed a great  stratification in the political life of Croatia, especially over  the past few weeks. The balance of political power is changing  rapidly; stratification has occured in literally all Croatian  political parties. Evidently it is necessary to consider early  elections. I am sure that they will facilitate a different  balance of power in the Croatian Parliament, which will provide  the opportunity for the IDS to get closer to participating in  the central state authorities! This is our aim and our wish. As  far as the disposition of political parties regarding our  political program is concerned, I must say that it is to be  expected that our ideas will not be welcomed with open arms.  However, the achieving of political aims is also a result of  compromise and interests, of the balance of powers at the  appropriate moment.    [Ivankovic] Could it be concluded that this new course  coincides with the crisis at the top of Croatian politics?    [Jakovcic] No! The interpretations that say we want to  strike at the moment the HDZ [Croatian Democratic Community] is  weak are wrong. We were supposed to adopt these documents at  the party convention in February, in Pazin, but we were not able  to do so due to the events in our party. We convened this one a  month and a half ago.    [Ivankovic] One of the declarations mentions a territorial  expansion of Istria. You state that Opatija, Cres, Mali Losinj,  Matulji, Moscenicka Draga, and other towns also belong to you.    [Jakovcic] This is our well-known political position. It is  not surprising, as our party is in power in that area; it is  certainly also because of that part of our program that we  gained the trust of the people there. If a referendum were to  be held in these areas, they would certainly join the County of  Istria, and it is our duty to let them express their positions,  if nothing else. Naturally, nothing will be done by force, as  was the case with the territorial organization of Croatia, when  these regions were left out of the territory of our county  exclusively because the people were against the HDZ, the local  HDZ.    [Ivankovic] Would you explain the position stated in the  declarations that a referendum is more valid than the decisions  made by the Parliament of the Republic of Croatia?    [Jakovcic] Take the confederation, which is a topical issue,  for instance. It is unacceptable to the IDS that a decision on,  say, joining a confederation with any state is made in  parliament. That has to be the result of a referendum.  <H5>  A Referendum for Changes </H5>   [Ivankovic] This position on referendums does not relate to  Istria then?    [Jakovcic] No, it would not mean that, for instance, a  referendum in Istria would be more powerful than the decisions  made by the Croatian Parliament. But, while we are on the  subject of a referendum in Istria, I believe that referendums  should be held when there is a wish for change, rather than  imposing something. This does not only relate to Istria, but to  the whole of Croatia.    [Ivankovic] There have been estimates that this is the most  severe crisis in the relations between Istria and the central  authorities ever.    [Jakovcic] I would not say this was the most severe crisis;  the issue is only the continuity of the politics toward Istria  that has now started to show its cards, having stated that it  can consolidate its positions in Istria with the police and  army, which is crazy! Except for the raised voice, there is  nothing new there. The fact is that the reputation of Croatian  leadership is at present the worst since we have had the  multiparty system!    [Ivankovic] How do you think things will develop regarding  the suspension of the Statute of the County of Istria?    [Jakovcic] It is difficult to predict, as circumstances  change very quickly, and the judiciary in Croatia is obviously  not independent. Ivic Pasalic's statement that "judges should  implement the state policies" is a clear indication of that.  The Statute may be suspended, but it will not change the  policies of the IDS, the County Assembly, and, least of all, of  our people.    [Ivankovic] Is the statute unconstitutional or not?    [Jakovcic] Absolutely not! It would be fair if those who  have been trying to have it suspended return it, so it can be  seen if there is anything that could perhaps be altered.  Regardless of that, I am sure we will be able to prove that our  statute complies with the Constitution and the laws.    [Ivankovic] Is there a danger of a commission being  appointed  in Istria, thus blocking the local authorities and introducing a  kind of "state of emergency"?    [Jakovcic] If that were to happen, it would represent the  definite end of the politics that subsists on conflicts anyway,  and as it gets difficult to find enemies, they are now found in  Istria. The appointment of the Council for Istria and the  announcement of the suspension of our statute happening at the  same time is no coincidence. The party in power wants to  mitigate its own crisis through the media, and is therefore now  trying to concentrate everything on Istria.  <H5>  Osimo Is Out of Date </H5>   [Ivankovic] Does it not seem to you now, after President  Tudjman asked that more people be appointed to the Council for  Istria, that his approach is more flexible?    [Jakovcic] This move was made at the moment it became clear  that the Council could fall apart, which would have been a great  discredit to those who founded the Council. If the task of the  Council was presenting the positions of the IDS and the citizens  of Istria to the president of the Republic, it would be  acceptable. However, that is evidently not the case.    [Ivankovic] You have now stated in the documents what you  had only talked about before, which is that Istria is left with  only two-thirds of the direct revenue, while one third goes to  the state.    [Jakovcic] That is the political position in principle, to  establish exactly what the direct revenue is, which would be in  accordance with the authorizations. The state would thus have  the basic attributes of statehood, which each region would have  to finance, and the regions would have a financial base. It is  really absurd that towns now have much greater budgets than the  counties they are in.    [Ivankovic] What is your interpretation of the political  situation in Italy and the demands regarding our territory?    [Jakovcic] There are neofascists everywhere. The Serbs have  them -- they want Greater Serbia; there are those who talk of a  banner on the Romanija, and then there are those who say that  Istria and Dalmatia are Italian. I am sure that the new Italian  Government will not consider these ideas of changing the  borders. At any rate, the IDS will be the first to oppose any  possibility of changing the borders, as every change of borders  in Istria always had a tragic end.    [Ivankovic] What about the annexes to the Osimo Accords?    [Jakovcic] They are simply necessary, as the Accords are out  of date. Croatia, Slovenia, and Italy should start constructive  talks. I would like to ask the authorities to include us, who  have a direct interest in it, in the process.  <H5>  [Box 1, p 5] </H5> <H5>  Istria as a European Region </H5>   [Ivankovic] One of the declarations you have adopted is the  Declaration on Istria as a European Region, consisting of  Croatian municipalities, three Slovenian ones, and one Italian.  You have proposed that Porec be the center of the region.    [Jakovcic] The concept of the organization of the European  region is similar to those of which there are about 40 in the  European Union, and it was drawn up with the hope that Croatia  and Slovenia aspire to the European Union. This final draft of  the declaration shows that no one here wants either an Istrian  Republic or state, as is said in the accusations of the  neofascists in Croatia, but that we want the free movement of  people, capital, and ideas on the territory where it has always  worked. I hope that it will be met with understanding in the  Croatian, Slovene, and Italian Parliaments. When Croatia is  accepted at the Council of Europe, we will present this as a  clear demand.  <H5>  [Box 2, p 5] </H5> <H5>  Demilitarization </H5>   [Ivankovic] You have demanded that Istria be a demilitarized  zone.    [Jakovcic] Our position that ladies in print pants rather  than uniformed soldiers should walk around Istria is well known.  This is not possible to regulate at present due to the semiwar  situation our state is in, but of Istria it is both an objective  need and a possibility. We would like to remind those who say  we are asking for this because the Istrians do not want to serve  in the Croatian Army and participate in safeguarding the  independence and sovereignty of Croatia, that even the highest  officials of the Ministry of Defense have established that the  degree of positive response to mobilization in Croatia was by  far the highest in Istria, and that our boys behave in a highly  disciplined way at the frontlines.</p>

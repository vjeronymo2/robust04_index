			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / Tec in receivership after 'Pounds 2m loss in eight months' The Department of Employment yesterday called in administrative receivers at South Thames Training and Enterprise Council because of its problems in meeting financial liabilities. This is the first time the department has taken such action on behalf of one of the 82 employer-led bodies that administer government training schemes in England and Wales. Tecs receive about Pounds 2bn in public funds to administer such programmes as Youth Training and Training for Work, a scheme for unemployed adults. In the Budget the chancellor cut funding for Training for Work from Pounds 762m to Pounds 578m. South Thames Tec is a private company which covers the London boroughs of Greenwich, Lambeth, Lewisham and Southwark, an area with the country's highest levels of unemployment. The Tec's board of directors asked the department to put it in administrative receivership. It is understood that it has lost about Pounds 2m in the last eight months. The decision to appoint a receiver followed three investigations into the Tec's financial systems and accounts by the employment department and independent accountants. Mr James Paice, employment minister, said: 'The conclusion was that the Tec is currently trading at a loss and forecasts that it will continue to do so, (and) that its present and potential liabilities exceeded its current and forecast assets.' Last October the department warned the South Thames Tec that it was in breach of contract for its weak financial monitoring systems. Mr Paice said: 'The problems clearly go back to inadequate financial management and control. Basically they have not lived within their means.' In August the Tec's finance director resigned after its non-executive board expressed concerns about accountancy practices. Mr Michael Hanson, the chief executive, resigned for health reasons. Under the terms of the receivership training services organised by the Tec will not be suspended. Mr Paice said the department will underwrite all training provider fees for three months. Mr Scott Barnes, one of the Grant Thornton partners appointed as administrative receivers, said he would consider transferring the Tec's activities to another organisation.</p>

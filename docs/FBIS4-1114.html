			<p>BFN     [Text] Nairobi, April 21 (AFP) -- The UN-controlled airport  in Mogadishu reopened Thursday [21 April] after fighting between  the city's warring clans died down following talks between UN  officials and clan leaders, a UN official said.    UN Operations in Somalia (UNOSOM) spokesman George Bennett  told AFP by phone from the Somali capital that following the  talks an official ceasefire was expected to come into effect  only on Friday.    He said sporadic gunfire during the day had died down  completely and the airport reopened by mid-day. Arrangements  for an April 25 meeting of warring clans as agreed in Nairobi  would go on as planned, he added.    Fighting erupted between the Habr Gedir and Hawadle clans on  Wednesday, with both sides battling for territory around the  airport. Two UN soldiers, a Malaysian and a Nepali, were  wounded in crossfire.    The fighting prevented UN staff from moving around the city  and forced them to retreat to the main UN compound in south  Mogadishu, while staffers living outside it were temporarily  moved inside.    Several flights out of Mogadishu were also cancelled as  fighters from the Habr Gedir clan of warlord Mohamed Farah Aidid  battled the Hawadle with mortars and rocket-propelled grenades,  according to the UN spokesman.    The Habr Gedir have a long-standing dispute with the Hawadle  over employment at the airport, controlled by the Hawadle until  the first US Marines landed there in December 1992.    Fighting between them has killed about nine Somalis and  wounded another 40 over the past five days.    Two Nepalis peacekeepers were killed in crossfire and a  Gambian employee of the UN refugee agency died when gunmen  opened fire on a UN plane in southwestern Somalia on Monday.    More than 80 UN soldiers and several civilian UN officials  have been killed since the UNOSOM was launched in May last year.</p>

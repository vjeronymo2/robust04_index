			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / 300 march to back striking lecturers About 300 people marched in support of striking lecturers at City of Bath College yesterday in a dispute over new working conditions. Nearly 50 academic staff, who have refused to sign new contracts, started a two-day strike on Monday. The dispute has the backing of Natfhe, the lecturers' union. More strikes are planned for Friday and next Monday and Tuesday. The strike action is a sharp escalation of the contracts row between Natfhe and college principals. The college has tried to introduce new contracts since colleges were removed from local authority control last April.</p>

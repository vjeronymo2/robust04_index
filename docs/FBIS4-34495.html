			<p>BFN     [Text] Santo Domingo, 20 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- The Committee for  the Defense of Democracy in the Dominican Republic today  paralyzed three Valverde districts to protest the fraud  committed in the 16 May general elections, local police sources  reported.    The protest, which was organized by opposition political  parties, affected Esperanza, Mao, and Laguna Salada, where  stores closed and urban and intra-urban transportation  decreased, a Dominican radio station reported.    Some 20 people were arrested and are under investigation for  throwing tacks on the streets, burning tires, and detonating  explosive devices, police reports stated.    Committee members were linked to the Santo Domingo  Agreement,  which established a coalition made up of opposition parties led  by Jose Francisco Pena Gomez of the Dominican Revolutionary  Party (PRD) and the Democratic Union (UD).    Pena Gomez, who was favored to win the elections in the  Dominican Republic, today reiterated his charges of electoral  fraud and presented the Central Electoral Board [JCE] with "new  evidence" that holds that organization responsible for the  irregularities.    JCE initial results show that President Joaquin Balaguer,  candidate for the Social Christian Reformist Party (PRSC), is  leading by a minimum margin, but electoral authorities have not  yet proclaimed his victory.    JCE President Manuel Garcia Lizardo reaffirmed that the  board  will not proclaim a winner yet based on the official results of  the elections because every one of the reported irregularities  is being investigated.    Meanwhile, Balaguer and Dante Caputo, UN envoy to Haiti,  discussed the Haitian crisis behind closed doors. Caputo, who  arrived in the morning, refused to give details on his meeting  with Balaguer, but said they discussed international initiatives  on the Haitian case.</p>

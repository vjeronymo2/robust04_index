			<p><P> February 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REAGANS' PRIMARY HOME  </P> <P> Ruth Ryon's column (Jan. 29) raised the question whether the White House or the  Santa Barbara estate would be considered the Reagans' primary residence  eligible for certain tax advantages (i.e. rollover of the gain). Richard Nixon  fought the same battle and lost to the IRS. Nixon tried to argue that his San  Clemente estate was his primary residence, but the IRS correctly held that  during his years in office the White House was his primary residence, and  therefore any gain on other properties was subject to tax currently.  </P> <P> PHILIP J.

In addition, as adjustments  in the price of grain purchased in line with this particular  state policy may increase urban residents' cost of living, the  problem will be solved by increasing urban workers' wages.    The source said that the central leadership required central  and local financial departments to play a leading role in  establishing a grain risk fund after prices are adjusted in  light of market forces in order to promote agricultural  production and guarantee peasants' interests. The central  authorities will allocate 2.8 billion yuan to various localities  to set up grain funds. At the same time, local authorities are  also required to allocate funds from their own financial  resources to set up grain risk funds.    The source said: The recent sharp increases in the prices of  grain and cooking oil were caused by psychological factors,  speculation, and temporary factors on the whole. Concretely  speaking, the price hike occurred first in Guangdong, and then  spread to other coastal areas. Because the law of marginal  returns has played its role, the area of land sown with grain  crops in Guangdong has decreased substantially. Now, as the  grain market has been opened, if the price of imported grain was  affordable, people would eat imported grain; as the price of  imported grain was too high, people competed with each other to  buy domestic grain. As a result, the price of grain was driven  up.    In fact, our country reaped a good harvest of grain crops in  1993, and stocks are also adequate. The transportation of grain  was also in a normal condition. Therefore, it is completely  possible to overcome the incorrect ideas of some local and  departmental leaders who regard the price hikes as harmless,  remove people's misgivings and misunderstandings, and rapidly  bring grain prices under control and back to a normal condition.    The source quoted a central leader as saying that the grain  price is the basic price in the market so it is necessary to  bring it under control as it has a bearing on the national  economy, the people's livelihood, and social stability. This is  also common practice in all countries practicing the market  economy, and is the main point in our domestic macroeconomic  control. Therefore, the central authorities will be thoroughly  responsible for this.    This source also said that the central authorities had  worked  out a scheme for raising urban workers' wages in order to offset  the impact of grain prices on the cost of living. The basic  monthly wage of 200 yuan will be increased by 30 percent so that  grain price increases in 1994 will also be offset.    The central authorities plan to keep the rate of grain price  increases in 1994 to below 10 percent.</p>

			<p><P> February 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EL MONTE FACING PARAMEDIC 'GAP';  </P> <P> OFFICIALS FEAR TRAUMA PATIENTS MAY SUFFER BECAUSE OF INSUFFICIENT LEVEL OF  SERVICE  </P> <P> City officials are trying to cope with what they call a "critical gap" in the  emergency care system when the city's only paramedic unit is in service, often  leaving the city without paramedic coverage.  </P> <P> The biggest problem, according to El Monte Fire Chief Leslie E. George, is that  El Monte's paramedic team takes a majority of its trauma calls to County-USC  Medical Center, about 12 miles away near downtown Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Also, many local emergency rooms sometimes refuse to accept patients because of  overcrowding, forcing the paramedics to transport non-trauma patients to  County-USC or hospitals out of the area, George said.  </P> <P> "Almost daily, we get incidents where we need paramedics and we don't have  them," George said. "It can take them 20 minutes to get in (to County-USC) and  an hour and a half to get back," George said.  </P> <P> Although paramedics are on duty 24 hours a day, only one team is in service at  any one time.  </P> <P> When the paramedic team is tied up, critical-care and trauma calls are handled  by less-trained emergency medical technicians. The technicians, either city  firefighters or ambulance operators, can perform basic life-support procedures,  such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation, but lack the advanced training and  equipment to adequately deal with critical trauma cases, said El Monte  Battalion Chief Ernest Jensen.  </P> <P> "The paramedics can do almost anything that can be done in the emergency room,  and they are supervised by a doctor," George said. "(The technicians) can only  do so much. . . . It's a critical situation."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Deepening Crisis  </P> <P> El Monte's problem is caused in large part by the deepening crisis faced by the  county's emergency medical network. The Jan. 1 closure of the trauma center at  Methodist Hospital in Arcadia may have brought the situation to a head, fire  officials say.  </P> <P> Pasadena's Huntington Memorial Medical Center, the only trauma center in the  San Gabriel Valley, expanded some of its territory after Methodist Hospital  dropped out of the system but cannot provide all the needed care.  </P> <P> Emergency rooms at local hospitals, including Greater El Monte Community  Hospital, Arcadia Methodist and Terrace Plaza Medical Center in Baldwin Park,  have occasionally refused to accept more patients in recent weeks. In addition,  Santa Teresita Hospital in Duarte closed its emergency room permanently this  month, a move expected to increase the load at surrounding hospitals.  </P> <P> "It's like pond ripples," George said. "Once one closes, it becomes more  critical."  </P> <P> Although no deaths have been attributed to the current problems, officials such  as Mayor Don McMillen are concerned about the effect the longer rides and  response times have on the patients' chances of survival.  </P> <P> "(Paramedics) can't drive around all night long with somebody dying in the  back," he said. "I really don't understand how all these hospitals got so busy  so quickly, but we've got to be able to take (patients) into the emergency  rooms."  </P> <P> Under county guidelines, paramedics, who provide advanced care during  transport, can be sent to hospitals farther away when local emergency rooms are  filled. By contrast, emergency medical technicians cannot be diverted except  under extraordinary circumstances.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Routine Diversions  </P> <P> Officials say diversions have become almost routine for both county and city  paramedic units.  </P> <P> But unlike county paramedic units in South El Monte, Temple City and Baldwin  Park, El Monte does not have a backup unit.  </P> <P> El Monte contracts with Medevac Emergency Medical Service to provide the  paramedic service along with basic ambulance service. Medevac officials say the  unit routinely takes its trauma patients to County-USC now that Arcadia's  trauma center is closed.  </P> <P> "Without traffic, we can be there in 20 minutes," said Karen Pointer, Medevac  operations manager. "If there's any traffic, that kind of blows it out of the  water."  </P> <P> On Dec. 31, paramedics could not respond to four of their 16 calls because they  were tied up either treating patients or in transport outside the city,  according to Fire Department logs. On a previous night, paramedics responded to  22 of 27 calls, leaving five potentially critically injured patients in the  care of emergency medical technicians.  </P> <P> "In those cases, (the firefighter or ambulances drivers) do the best that they  can until the paramedics arrive," Jensen said.  </P> <P> Virginia Price-Hastings, chief of the county's paramedic and trauma hospitals  program, said most cities that cannot afford to have a unit on standby have  made stopgap arrangements.  </P> <P> "In most other areas, the city has some kind of backup, whether it be from the  county or from the (ambulance) provider," she said. "But there are costs  associated with that."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Unfeasible Option  </P> <P> For El Monte, the cost of adding a second unit would be $400,000, a figure  George says makes that option unfeasible.  </P> <P> El Monte pays $1 a year to Medevac for the paramedic service. As part of the  agreement, Medevac is the sole provider of ambulance service within the city,  charging patients for hospital transportation.  </P> <P> In the past, El Monte has occasionally received help from county paramedics  when it has more calls than Medevac can handle, George said. El Monte's  paramedics have reciprocated, but on a more infrequent basis, he said.  </P> <P> George said he hopes new equipment will help ease part of the problem. The Fire  Department wants to equip each of the city's five fire engines with an  automated heart defibrillator unit. The unit, which costs about $5,000, would  increase the firefighters' ability to respond to cardiac arrests, a frequent  occurrence in a city with a high concentration of senior citizens.  </P> <P> The City Council authorized $16,000 toward the purchase of defibrillators and  necessary training, and George has been appealing to the community to donate  about $10,000. Properly used, George estimated, the portable defibrillators  could increase a patient's chances of surviving a heart attack by 30% or more.  </P> <P> But with more emergency rooms turning paramedics away and the lack of available  funding to open more trauma centers, the defibrillators will solve only part of  the problem, George said.  </P> <P> Fire officials cannot quantify how the lack of immediate paramedic response has  affected patient recovery rates, but the assumption is that any delay is  detrimental.  </P> <P> Increasingly, George said, dispatchers deal with apprehensive calls from fire  captains in the field asking for paramedics to treat critically injured  patients.  </P> <P> "You an hear it over the radio -- the tension in the captain's voice as he  keeps asking when the paramedics are going to get there," George said.  </P></p>

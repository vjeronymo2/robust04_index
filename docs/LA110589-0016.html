			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TALES OF JAY LENO, MR. NICE GUY  </P> <P> I enjoyed Lawrence Christon's Oct. 22 Jay Leno article, which brought to mind  two incidents.  </P> <P> I tried stand-up comedy at San Francisco's Holy City Zoo at a beginners' "open  mike" night in 1976. The task didn't seem daunting until the comedian before me  exploded with brilliant improvisation. He closed by inviting the audience for  ice cream across Clement Street. This left mercifully few patrons to see me  bomb.  </P> <P> I asked the bartender if this comedian really was a beginner. His answer: "This  was only Robin Williams' second time here."  </P> <P> The bartender continued: "Why don't you come back next Sunday? You can go on  before a fellow who wants to 'work out' here with some new material."  </P> <P> The following Sunday, I dutifully performed and then sat slack-jawed along with  other comedic hopefuls as we watched Jay Leno deliver a tremendous 1-hour,  45-minute set. For him, it was just a practice. For us, it was an unforgettable  lesson in humor, pacing, stage technique and reaching your audience.  </P> <P> ANDREW TETON  </P> <P> Santa Barbara  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by S. Tsekhmistrenko, under the rubric "The World </F> Over the Week": "Space Passions in Nonintegrated Expanses";  first paragraph in italic is from poem by Chingiz Aytmatov,  "Stormy Flag Stop (And the Day Lasts Longer Than a Century)"]    [Text]    And again the trains were running from the east to the  west and from the west to the east...    And off to both sides of the railroad in those parts  were all the desert expanses that had been untouched since time  immemorial -- the Sary-Ozeks, the Midlands of the yellow  steppes.    There was not even any mention of the Sary-Ozek-1  cosmodrome back then. Maybe it was only being drawn in the plans  of the future creators of space flight.    But the trains still kept running from the east to the  west and from the west to the east...    Forgotten in the endless Kazakhstan countryside, the "stormy  flag stop" of our day is Tyuratam (that -- from the name of the  closest railroad station -- is what the Russian military are  used to telling everyone is the name of the well known Baykonur  cosmodrome), which has, unexpectedly for most of our  contemporaries, found its way to the epicenter of the serious  passions that have flared up in recent months between Russia and  Kazakhstan. Who could have imagined that the Kazakhs at the end  of the 20th century would want to trade their customary steeds  and camels for places in space vehicles. But the cunning  intrigue that has surrounded Baykonur was topped recently with a  no less cunning decision.    Nursultan Nazarbayev could easily be considered the creator  and main persona of the intrigue. The bargaining with Moscow on  Baykonur he conducted unhurriedly, having begun it when  Kazakhstan announced its independence -- on 31 August 1991. That  day, a delayed-action mine was laid: the cosmodrome, the city of  Leninsk, and all the movable and immovable property in the city  were declared to be the property of Kazakhstan. That moment  could have signaled the end of the cosmodrome -- not wanting to  invest any money at all in Baykonur (since everything would go  to Kazakhstan anyway), Moscow nearly lost interest in it. But  Moscow had a change of mind in time, after it apparently saw  that carving out an alternative route to the stars would be  fairly difficult in the coming years. And national pride played  a role, too: why was it, specifically, that we had to give up  what had been built by forces of the "new historical community  -- the soviet people," where the Kazakhs are just a part of the  whole?    Such thoughts came to Nazarbayev's mind much earlier than  they did to Yeltsin's mind -- as early as 1992. That was when he  first got the idea to create an international consortium at  Baykonur. To put it simpler, lure Uncle Sam to those virgin  expanses. The idea was then buried -- because Uncle Sam already  has a cosmodrome in Florida and wasn't very sanguine about  pouring dollars into the Kazakhstan sand. Replacing that idea  was the lease -- that was what Alma-Ata proposed that Moscow do  with Baykonur last December. And Alma-Ata asked what seemed a  very modest sum -- $40 billion a year, which later changed to $7  billion, and later yet was halved to $3.5 billion. Andrey  Kozyrev, who had prepared the Russian-Kazakh summit, centered  his dialogue with Alma-Ata in February on the last figure. The  dialogue was reminiscent of the joke from bazaar life: "How much  are the flowers?" "Twenty thousand each." "Why so expensive?" "I  need money bad."    In order to force Moscow to be more compliant, Nazarbayev  prepared for it an almost Christmas surprise. Even two. Early in  the year, rumors were circulated on a consortium, and the rumors  were confirmed by the January visit to Kazakhstan of a  delegation from America's NASA. The aeronauts [sic] signed an  agreement with Alma-Ata about nothing less than the conduct of  joint observations of outer space and of space-vehicle fragments  that could be hazardous to orbital facilities (you can imagine  the face of the commander-in-chief of the military space forces  of Russia, Ivanov, when he got the news that Russian fragments  would be studied by foreign uncles!). And Nazarbayev, who was in  Kiev about that time, reached an agreement on some sort of joint  space program with Leonid Kravchuk. Negotiations were held on  the deployment at the cosmodrome of some sort of "international  space forces" hardly under the aegis of the UN, in which the  Russians certainly wouldn't have the role of first violin. Those  steps were viewed by Moscow with poorly masked irritation -- it  wasn't about to share Baykonur with anybody.    Many years will have to pass before it becomes clear to what  extent Nazarbayev's actions were calculated and to what extent  they were a bluff. Certainly, aeronauts on the banks of the  Dnieper couldn't even imagine themselves sipping fat through  tubes one fine day aboard a spacecraft flying the  yellow-and-blue flag. In actuality, there's enough money today  to get to, maybe, the middle of that great river. The reaction  across the ocean was much more interesting. Initially there,  they sort of bit on the idea of a consortium -- the talks  reached an apogee during Nazarbayev's visit to Washington. But  then they rather rapidly came to nothing. Especially when people  in the United States began talking about the unsuitability of  Baykonur and its infrastructure for Western space hardware, not  to mention the Western hardware specialists.    But Nursultan Abishevich achieved his goal: by the time of  the start of the Russian-Kazakh summit, Moscow was ready to  agree to a number of Alma-Ata's conditions regarding Baykonur.  For example, the term of the lease (20 years, instead of the 30  that Moscow had asked for). Or the lease payment being in hard  currency (Moscow initially suggested payment in rubles, but the  Kazakhs were too sophisticated to go for that). But those things  didn't involve what was most important. And no one should be  confused by Alma-Ata's consent -- too fast, at first glance --  to the amount for the lease, a paltry $115 million in all,  which, in addition, is to be paid on a compensatory basis and in  the context of mutual settlements between the two countries. I  dare say that Baykonur, from the beginning, was regarded by  Nazarbayev as a splinter in the country's side, as something  that had to be removed at any price, but not without saving  face. The splinter is now removed, and the face is glowing with  profound, full satisfaction.    Having solved the problem of the splinter, Nazarbayev, stung  by the political battles, has now immersed himself in a more  customary element, advancing the idea of creating a new Union --  this one, Eurasian -- across the broad expanses of the former  USSR. Declaring that the "euphoria of sovereignty" is now a  thing of the past, Nazarbayev has concluded that the successful  development of the ex-Soviet peoples is possible only on the  road to consolidation in a new union -- a union with one  parliament, one economic and defense policy, one border, and one  currency.    Curiously enough, in fighting for the well-being of the  peoples, the president of Kazakhstan allowed that now all of  them are worthy of joining in on the new integration ecstasy.  "Less equal" were those who, to this day, pay tribute to the god  of war, Mars (the Armenians, the Georgians, the Tajiks, and the  Azerbaijanis). The rest, according to Nursultan Abishevich's  logic, will become members of some sort of "elitist club" that  doesn't care about what's happening outside its walls. He was  quiet about who would be in control of the club. One can only  guess that the leader of Kazakhstan would give himself one of  the leading roles in the EAU [Eurasian Union]. And in fact, it's  true that Nazarbayev has long sat in the backyard of the CIS,  and how can it be forgotten that they didn't call him to  Belovezhskaya Pushcha?    Only the lazy ones in Russia didn't take up Nazarbayev's  idea, and everyone is trying to palm it off as his own (the  first to do that have been those who have designs in the future  on the biggest, most comfortable office in the Kremlin). The  first to respond was Vladimir Shumeyko, who interpreted  Nazarbayev's initiative in his own way: a new union could be  created, in his opinion, on the basis of already existing  institutions of the CIS, including (clearly) the  Interparliamentary Assembly, which is headed by Shumeyko. And  his friend and rival, Sergey Shakhray, even intends to publish  on behalf of the PRES [not further expanded] in the next few  days a draft of a treaty on a confederative union, the basis for  which will be the "same idea that President Nazarbayev has, but  written in legal language." In that, apparently, Shakhray has  garnered much more experience than Nazarbayev has.    The only one who has maintained a wise silence is the one  who  was the first to hear the idea of a Eurasian Union, Boris  Yeltsin. And judging from everything, the Kazakhstan leader was  a bit discouraged by the reaction of the Russian president -- or  more precisely, by the absence of a reaction (it's no accident  that, as he left Moscow, he kept saying that he wasn't joking  and that his idea wasn't anything earth-shaking at all). The  silence of the proprietor of the Kremlin lasted indecently long  -- until Thursday, when, through his press-secretary Kostikov,  Yeltsin uttered that he "showed a guarded interest" in the  creation of an EAU. The morals to the story here could be two:  "The cobbler should stick to his last" and "Don't eye someone  else's bread." Anyway, we'll keep going and we'll see.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the case of vehicles over 14,000 pounds GVW, CARB allows  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the use of eight mode steady-state testing, using the same pre-conversion, post-conversion comparison as for vehicles under 14,000  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pounds GVW. Again, the Agency believes that it is possible with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this approach to certify an aftermarket conversion which exceeds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the original configuration's emissions standards. Also, the Agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> does not believe that steady-state testing is appropriate under any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> circumstances. It is well-understood that emission control systems  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> can be designed for low emissions when tested using steady-state  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> test procedures, but provide little emissions control under real-world, transient conditions. <FOOTCITE>19</FOOTCITE>  It is for this reason that EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adopted the heavy-duty transient test cycle in place of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> thirteen mode steady state test for all heavy-duty engine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification, effective in the mid-1980s. Thus, EPA does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believe that it would be appropriate to adopt the CARB test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures for these vehicles. It should be noted that CARB does  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allow for alternative test cycles for vehicles over 14,000 pounds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> GVW, subject to advance approval from the Executive Officer. It is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Agency's belief that, given the transient test is the test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cycle which these vehicles would have originally been certified on,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it is likely that CARB would approve its use for conversion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification, thus eliminating the need for two separate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification procedures for vehicles over 14,000 pounds GVW.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 19 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 45 FR 4136, January 21, 1980. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3.

These comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tended not to be specific, but rather asked the Agency to clarify  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> what the requirements were for an aftermarket conversion on an OBD-equipped vehicle. A few commenters suggested that EPA require new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicle manufacturers to provide some means of shutting off the OBD  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system during alternative fuel operation in order to prevent the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system from storing faulty trouble codes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> EPA response to comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As explained in the preamble to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rule, EPA believes that a tampering exemption should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditioned upon certification demonstrating that the converted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicle has the ability to comply with the applicable emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards and will have demonstrated adequate durability. As was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mentioned above, shortly after publication of the proposal for this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule, the Agency adopted requirements, effective for the 1994 model  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year, which require OBD systems on new light-duty vehicles and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> light-duty trucks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While the aftermarket conversions proposal did not explicitly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> make clear that compliance with the OBD requirements (as well as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certain other title II requirements) must be demonstrated to obtain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a certification, the Agency believes this is implicit in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussion of the justification for the exemption. The Agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> explained in the proposal that ``Congress intended to prohibit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tampering that would result in emission noncompliance,'' and that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``[t]he language of the tampering provisions emphasizes the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance of the vehicle with the title II regulations.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA's justification for the exemption for conversions from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tampering restrictions was based on the incongruity of prohibiting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conversions that result in a vehicle meeting emission standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable to vehicles of the fuel type to which the vehicles have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been converted. The OBD requirements, even if not ``emissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards'' in the traditional sense, clearly have an underlying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions control purpose. And the tampering prohibitions of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 203(a)(3) of the Act explicitly apply to the disabling of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any device ``installed on or in a motor vehicle or motor vehicle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engine in compliance with regulations under this title.&blank;.&blank;.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Disabling an OBD system is clearly prohibited as tampering. It is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> therefore not at all clear that EPA would have authority to provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an exemption from the tampering prohibition for a conversion that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> do not meet the same OBD requirements as the vehicle would have had  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to meet had it been originally manufactured to operate on fuel type  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to which it has been converted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

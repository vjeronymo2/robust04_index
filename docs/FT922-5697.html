			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / MEPC warns of downturn at full year: UK property company reinforces gloom with fall of 13% over six months MEPC, the UK's second largest property company, yesterday reinforced the mood of gloom in the UK property market and hinted that profits for the year to end September may be lower than they were in the previous 12 months. 'Recent events in the UK property market are unlikely to lead to an early improvement,' Sir Christopher Benson, MEPC's chairman, warned in a statement accompanying the half-year report. 'The outlook for the current year is tempered by the virtual elimination of opportunities to realise trading profits, particularly in the UK, and, with the receipt of investment income on new lettings delayed due to current market conditions, it will be difficult to repeat the level of profit achieved last year.' MEPC said its rental income in the six months to March increased 6 per cent to Pounds 158.1m, but after higher finance charges of Pounds 45.7m (Pounds 35.9m) pre-tax prof-its were 13 per cent lower at Pounds 58.6m. The group does not publish a revised net asset value - one of the most widely-watched numbers - at the half-way stage. Earnings per share for the period were 12.4p, compared with 14.2p last time, while the interim dividend has been maintained at 5.25p. The company said that eight of the nine UK developments under construction at the beginning of the year were now complete, but that 'the letting of developments completed in 1991 and 1992 has been slow, particularly in the City of London.' At Alban Gate, the huge City development, MEPC has so far let only 40,000 sq ft of the 400,000 sq ft available. Outside London, however, the Royal Victoria Place shopping centre in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, has opened with 'substantial lettings'. At the last count, about 20 per cent of MEPC's total portfolio was in the City and 44 per cent in central London. The group said yesterday that its investment portfolio had produced a ' solid performance'. In the UK, increased rents had been achieved on review and new rental income was beginning to flow from developments completed last year, though such increases were offset by sales of investment property. Vacancies in the investment portfolio fell slightly to 3 per cent, while the incidence of bad debts was 'not significant'. MEPC's shares yesterday rose 2p to 355p. Lex, Page 18</p>

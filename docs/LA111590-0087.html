			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: PORT OF HUENEME;  </P> <P> DEL MONTE TO IMPORT 50% MORE BANANAS  </P> <P> Del Monte Tropical Fruit Co. will import 50% more bananas through the Port of  Hueneme each year beginning in January, company spokesmen have told Oxnard  Harbor District commissioners.  </P> <P> The company's weekly load will jump from 100,000 to 150,000 tons a year,  including fruit shipped for Turbana Corp.  </P> <P> After the Ecuadorean fruit reaches Ventura County's deep-sea port, it is  distributed across the West Coast and Canada.  </P> <P> Turbana formerly shipped its bananas into the Port of Los Angeles on vessels  owned by United Fruit Co., growers of Chiquita-brand bananas. The ports of Los  Angeles, Long Beach and Hueneme are the only West Coast ports that handle  bananas.  </P> <P> At their Tuesday meeting, Oxnard Harbor District commissioners called the  contract a tremendous boon to the port's economic viability. Del Monte  officials expect to pay the port about $100,000 more per year.  </P> <P> Port customers are charged fees based on the length of ships, length of stay  and fruit discharge per ton, said Kevin Lee, Del Monte's operations manager.  </P> <P> Turbana once shipped bananas into Ventura County on its own vessels, but as the  company's volume dropped off, it contracted to put bananas on United Fruit  ships.  </P> <P> "It's 50% more bananas with minimum impact on the port," said William Buenger,  the port's deputy executive director. "The ships are already here. It compacts  it." DONNA DOWLING  </P></p>

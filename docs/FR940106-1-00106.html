			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The Roe Island salinity criteria are meant to replicate natural spring storm cycles and are invoked only after uncontrolled runoff has placed the 2 ppt isohaline seaward of Roe Island. Therefore, the criteria for Roe Island represent the maximum number of days that the 2 ppt isohaline must be located there.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Spawning Habitat_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Delta smelt adults seek shallow, tidally-influenced, freshwater (i.e., less than 2 ppt salinity) backwater sloughs and edgewaters for spawning. To ensure egg hatching and larval viability, spawning areas also must provide suitable water quality (i.e., low concentrations of pollutants) and substrates for egg attachment (e.g., submerged tree roots and branches and emergent vegetation). Specific areas that have been identified as important delta smelt spawning habitat include Barker, Lindsey, Cache, Prospect, Georgiana, Beaver, Hog, and Sycamore Sloughs and the Sacramento River in the Delta, and tributaries of northern Suisun Bay. The spawning season varies from year to year and may start as early as December and extend until July.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Larval and Juvenile Transport_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To ensure that delta smelt larvae are transported from the area where they are hatched to shallow, productive rearing or nursery habitat, the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers and their tributary channels must be protected from physical disturbance (e.g., sand and gravel mining, diking, dredging, and levee or bank protection and maintenance) and flow disruption (e.g., water diversions that result in entrainment and in-channel barriers or tidal gates). Adequate river flow is necessary to transport larvae to rearing habitat in Suisun Bay. To ensure that suitable rearing habitat is available in Suisun Bay, the salinity criteria described above in Table 1 are required. Reverse flows that maintain larvae upstream in deep-channel regions of low productivity and expose them to entrainment interfere with these transport requirements. Suitable water quality must be provided so that maturation is not impaired by pollutant concentrations. The specific geographic area important for larval transport is confined to waters contained within the legal boundary of the Delta, Suisun Bay, and Montezuma Slough and its tributaries. The specific season when habitat conditions identified above are important for successful larval transport varies from year to year depending on when peak spawning occurs. Therefore, habitat conditions suitable for transport of larvae and juveniles may be required as early as February 1 and as late as August 31.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Rearing Habitat_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Maintenance of the 2 ppt isohaline (according to the salinity criteria described in Table 1) and suitable water quality (low concentrations of pollutants) within the Estuary is necessary to provide delta smelt larvae and juveniles a shallow, protective, food-rich environment in which to mature to adulthood. This placement of the 2 ppt isohaline also serves to protect larval, juvenile, and adult delta smelt from entrainment in the State and Federal water projects. However, additional flows above those required to implement the February through June salinity criteria listed in Table 1 may be required occasionally to protect larval and juvenile delta smelt from being entrained in the State and Federal water projects during the months of July and August. These additional flows will be required when the previous year's abundance indices show that the adult population already is at low levels and late spawning conditions have led to distribution of larval and juvenile delta smelt upstream of the confluence of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers in July and August. An area extending eastward from Carquinez Straits, including Suisun Bay, Grizzly Bay, Honker Bay, Montezuma Slough and its tributary sloughs, up the Sacramento River to its confluence with Three Mile Slough, and south along the San Joaquin River including Big Break, defines the specific geographic area critical to the maintenance of suitable rearing habitat. Three Mile Slough represents the approximate location of the most upstream extent of tidal excursion when the salinity criteria described in Table 1 are implemented. Protection of rearing habitat conditions may be required from the beginning of February to the end of August.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Adult Migration_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Adult delta smelt must be provided unrestrained access to suitable spawning habitat in a period that may extend from December to July. Therefore, adequate flow and suitable water quality must be maintained to attract migrating adults in the Sacramento and San Joaquin River channels and their associated tributaries, including Cache and Montezuma Sloughs and their tributaries. These areas also must be protected from physical disturbance and flow disruption during migratory periods. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

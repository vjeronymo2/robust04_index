			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / BA to shed 300 staff at Gatwick BRITISH AIRWAYS is to cut 300 jobs at Gatwick airport as part of an efficiency drive. Ground staff and cabin and flight crew will be affected. The cuts, to be achieved voluntarily, represent the first stage in a three-year plan to return BA's Gatwick operation to 'an acceptable level of profitability'. BA does not rule out further job losses before the end of that period. Other productivity initiatives include increased provision for Boeing 737 maintenance and taking back work that had been contracted out. It is intended that those objectives should be met without increasing engineering staffing. BA employs 5,700 people at Gatwick, including 1,300 engineering staff. The company yesterday also announced further flights from the airport to attract business passengers. 'Gatwick is seen as a holiday airport by many people,' said BA. 'We are trying to build an effective hub at Gatwick to appeal to business travellers.' The number of flights scheduled for the summer will increase, largely through doubling services to Copenhagen, Naples and Milan to two flights a day. The company said the plan for growth confirmed its commitment to Gatwick.</p>

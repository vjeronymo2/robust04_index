Eyewitnesses and security guards at the U.S. Embassy  confirmed that at 2345 (0545 GMT), several individuals in a blue  car fired several shots.    The peasants, who are members of the Federation of Workers  and Laborers [Federacion de Trabajadores y Obreros], early this  morning are patrolling the area with sticks and machetes to ward  off attacks. The Indians have been in front of the embassy for  three days to request the mission's mediation with the "Penny  Foundation" [Fundacion del Centavo], which charges them  excessive interest rates on loans made to families to buy land  and build houses.    The attack is part of the wave of violence prevailing in the  Guatemalan capital, where in the last four hours unidentified  individuals set off explosive charges at electricity pylons.  There is unease among the Guatemalan people 48 hours before a  referendum is held to reform the Legislative and Judicial  Branches and shorten the presidential term from five to four  years.</p>

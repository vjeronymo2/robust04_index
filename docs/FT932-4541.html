			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / Italy widens its inquiry into aviation ROME magistrates yesterday disclosed that they had opened an important new line of inquiry covering the aerospace sector and business and aviation contracts. The investigation centres on the formation of the aerospace group Alenia through the 1990 merger of Italy's state-controlled defence and electronics groups, Aeritalia and Selenia. The magistrates said three senior executives involved in the deal had been advised they were under investigation for alleged falsification of accounts. The executives included Mr Fausto Cereti, former chief executive of Aeritalia, and Mr Enrico Gimelli, his former number in Selenia, both now joint managers of Alenia. The third person was Mr Fabiano Fabiani, the head of Finmeccanica, the chief industrial arm of the state holding company, Iri, which controlled the merging groups. Mr Fabiani is one of the key managers in the public sector and Finmeccanica is one of the two central pillars of Iri's operations. This is the first time Finmeccanica has become directly involved in investigations by magistrates. Until now investigations into alleged corruption have stopped at a subsidiary level, as in the case of its engineering and transportation arm, Ansaldo. The merger was part of a rationalisation of assets and operations held under Iri's umbrella. Selenia was previously controlled by Stet, the state telecommunications holding, and it moved under the wing of Finmeccanica to shape up to international competition in the nineties. According to usually reliable leaks from the magistrates, they are examining the valuations made of the two groups prior to the merger. During the course of the magistrates' investigation they are also understood to have branched out to examine certain aspects of Alitalia's operations purchasing and leasing aircraft. This led on Monday to Mr Giovanni Bisignani, the Alitalia chief executive, being advised he was under investigation for alleged falsification of accounts. Yesterday, Alitalia issued a strong denial, pointing out that the operations in question represented normal international practice. Also in the aviation field, it was reported yesterday that police had seized documentation relating to airport construction work over the past decade. In another development yesterday, Mr Bettino Craxi, the former Socialist leader, was informed he was wanted for questioning for allegedly receiving L360m (Pounds 160,000) passed on via intermediaries from his long-standing adversary Olivetti, for the supply of information equipment to the justice ministry.</p>

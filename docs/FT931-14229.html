			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / International Company News: Qantas to make 9% of workforce redundant QANTAS, the government-controlled Australian airline, plans to make 9 per cent of its workforce redundant over the next two years to help cut costs by ADollars 158m (USDollars 108.9m) a year. Yesterday's announcement follows a review by Coopers and Lybrand, the accounting firm, which said the 1,835 redundancies would save ADollars 95m a year. The remainder of the savings are to be made by increasing efficiency. The review was set up after the merger of Qantas and Australian Airlines, the government-owned domestic airline, in September. The two airlines have already shed a total 5,000 staff in the past 18 months. Mr John Ward, chief executive, said the savings were essential to increase efficiency in the run-up to the flotation of the government's 75 per cent shareholding, expected later this year. Mr Ward said Qantas would shortly begin discussions on potential synergies with British Airways, which recently acquired a a 25 per cent stake in the airline. He said the discussions could lead to further job losses. Qantas said it hoped the trade unions would co-operate with the redundancy programme, which will be delayed until next month to give the unions time to respond.</p>

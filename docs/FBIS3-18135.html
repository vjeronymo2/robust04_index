			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by "deu": "Scharping for Rigid Austerity Course"] </F>   [Text] Bonn -- In the event of the assumption of power,  the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] will ensure the  equalization of burdens similar to the scheme adopted after  World War II to gradually finance German unity. First of all,  the "number of shadow budgets linked with German unity must be  combined under one budget" so that the overall cost is clear to  the citizens, SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping stated at a meeting  of the "Frankfurt Circle," a left-wing forum within the SPD, in  Oer-Erkenschwick. He mentioned the sum of 750 billion German  marks [DM]. To raise this sum, he mainly wants to focus on the  owners of large assets. "Everybody will have to make a  reasonable contribution." The SPD's candidate for chancellor  left it open whether a levy on property should be introduced,  whether the assessed value for land should be adapted, or  whether government bonds should be issued.    Scharping stated that all planned financial and economic  measures that are currently being drafted for the SPD government  program are serving two goals: Taxes and fees must not be  increased beyond the level planned for 1995. "The same applies  to state indebtedness." Within this framework, however, numerous  adjustments are required.    Scharping's statements met with criticism among the  left-leaning SPD members. Several speakers pointed out that  such a strict financial framework does not leave enough leeway  for reducing mass unemployment. However, Scharping clearly  rejected efforts to concentrate primarily on employment programs  financed by the state in the fight against unemployment. What  is needed is an intelligent combination of various  possibilities. "We must make the productive forces of society  visible to a greater extent and not simply rely on the state,"  he stressed.    Scharping emphatically pleaded in favor of a "very reserved"  use of promises during the election campaign. "I will not  support anything that cannot be realized between 1994 and 1998,"  he pointed out. "Otherwise we will have to face the  consequences in 1998, and the whole democratic system will be  discredited." Yet it is certain that the SPD wants to withdraw  the abolition of the bad weather allowance. Moreover,  developments in eastern Germany must be assessed realistically.  Currently, about DM150 billion annually are being transferred  from eastern to western Germany. "If this does not change,  eastern Germany will reach 70 percent of western economic  strength in 15 years," the party chairman pointed out.    According to Scharping, the "intelligent combination" of  measures in the fight against unemployment includes  "environmentally friendly economic growth" and the promotion of  new technologies. Scharping called for a more far-reaching  European cooperation concerning communications and environmental  technologies, genetic engineering, and the transportation  systems. Generally, he advocated the promotion of investments  and the reduction of consumptive expenditure. Thus, it is  necessary to abolish numerous bureaucratic regulations  preventing investments -- including high standards in the sphere  of construction, for example. State activities must be  modernized. In the discussion about the privatization of public  tasks, Scharping called for an "examination without any taboos,"  while taking into consideration costs, quality, and social  consequences. "Those who ignore that do not pursue a  responsible policy." There are also considerations to deduct  social benefits like family allowance from the tax liability  instead of having them paid by special authorities.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Likewise, CPSC reports that, based upon data from its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) (NEISS is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a probability sample of hospital emergency rooms in the United  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States that is used by the CPSC to measure the magnitude of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> injury problem associated with consumer products and to provide a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> source for followup investigations of selected cases), there was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a significant upward trend in the estimated number of hospital  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emergency room-treated iron ingestion cases involving children  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under 5 years of age in the 1980 to 1993 period. Every annual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimate in the 1980 to 1985 period was smaller than every annual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimate in the 1986 to 1993 period. The estimated average  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number of cases annually was 1,240 for the 1980 to 1985 period  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and 3,170 for the 1986 to 1993 period (Ref. 1). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. CPSC Case Reports  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> CPSC considers iron-containing products to be potentially  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hazardous to children and, thus, has taken a number of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant steps designed to reduce the risk from these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products. As part of its efforts, CPSC has collected detailed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information on pediatric iron poisoning fatalities and has also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conducted followup (from NEISS data) investigations of incidents  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of nonfatal pediatric iron ingestion where the victim was taken  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to a hospital emergency room. In order to evaluate the available  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data on specific occurrences of iron poisoning as fully as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possible, FDA obtained from CPSC the case reports on 37 fatal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pediatric poisonings (Ref. 21) and on 70 NEISS followup  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> investigations of nonfatal pediatric iron ingestions for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> years 1986 to 1993 (Ref. 22). These data are described below and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are summarized in Tables 4 and 5.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Table 4 summarizes the data obtained from CPSC on 37 iron  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> poisoning fatalities of young children since 1986. Among these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fatalities, the average age of the victim was 16.8 months. In 25  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of these 37 deaths, the iron potency of the implicated product  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was reported. These 25 products contained, on average, 63 mg  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> iron per dosage unit. The lowest reported potency of an iron-containing product involved in these pediatric deaths was 40 mg  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> iron per dosage unit. The potency of the iron-containing product  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> involved in the 12 other deaths was not reported.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Table 4 shows that, in 21 of the 37 fatalities, information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the number of tablets or capsules consumed by the victim was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reported. Among these 21 reports, the average number of iron  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tablets or capsules consumed by the victim was 39.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Table 4 also shows that in 56 percent of these 37 pediatric  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deaths (21/37), the iron-containing product visually appeared to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be packaged in child-resistant packaging (CRP), and more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specifically, in containers with apparently child-resistant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> closures (CRC). In 16 percent of the deaths (6/37), the iron-containing supplement was not packaged in CRP. Among the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remaining deaths (10/37), the type of packaging was not reported.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

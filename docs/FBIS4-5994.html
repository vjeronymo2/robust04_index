			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 18 (KCNA) -- A resolution on Korea  was adopted recently at the 7th pan-African conference held in  Kampala, Uganda.    The resolution denounces the continued threat and blackmail  of the United States to the Democratic People's Republic of  Korea.    It says:    The conference is concerned over the scheme of the United  States of America to venture a military intervention for  destroying the nuclear development capacity of Korea which is  being used for a peaceful purpose.    The USA must open first its own nuclear facilities to an  international inspection. This is the only fair and peaceful  solution for avoiding genocide.    The conference denounces the reckless massacre committed by  the USA in Iraq and demands that it should not repeat this  mistake in Korea.    The 7th pan-African conference also calls upon all the  countries to promote the peaceful reunification of the Korean  peninsula, helping the Korean people in the North and the South  solve the question of reunification by themselves.</p>

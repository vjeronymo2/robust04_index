			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Following are reports on insurgent  activities in Peru compiled from Peruvian papers published on 11  December.    The National Counterterrorism Directorate on 18 November  arrested Shining Path "terrorist" Edison Tomas Zarate Untiveros,  23, in Lima's La Victoria District. He carried ammunition,  "subversive" literature, and handwritten notes. He had sought  refuge in Argentina, from where he returned to Peru at the  request of People's Aid of Peru to head its defense department's  military command and to prepare car bombs for the organization.  Zarate reportedly was involved in car bombs that exploded  between September and November. Police also arrested six other  Shining Path "terrorists" during operations in Lima between 24  November and 2 December. (Lima EL COMERCIO in Spanish 11 Dec 93  p A16)</p>

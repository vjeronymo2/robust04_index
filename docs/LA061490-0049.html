			<p><P> June 14, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: SIMI VALLEY;  </P> <P> OLD RAILROAD DEPOT STUDIED FOR MUSEUM  </P> <P> Like most Western towns, the advent of the railroad played a major role in the  development of Simi Valley.  </P> <P> When the Santa Susana Railroad Tunnel was opened in 1904, it transformed the  quiet Ventura County farming community into an important trade center by  connecting it with nearby Los Angeles County.  </P> <P> Until then, the only means of transportation between the Simi and San Fernando  valleys was by wagon trail over the steep, rock-studded Santa Susana Mountains.  </P> <P> Now the Rancho Simi Recreation and Parks District wants to pay tribute to the  railroad by turning a vacant Southern Pacific railroad depot into a historical  museum.  </P> <P> The district at its meeting today is expected to approve an agreement with the  Rancho Simi Foundation, a nonprofit community organization, "to work as  partners in the restoration of the building," said Dmitri Hunt, a parks  official.  </P> <P> The two-story railroad depot was used from 1904 to 1974, when it sat alongside  the tracks at Tapo Street and Los Angeles Avenue. In 1975, it was purchased by  the park district for $1 and moved to its present site on Katherine Road in  Santa Susana Park.  </P> <P> The restoration of the depot, which was recognized in 1976 as a county  historical landmark, will cost between $100,000 and $200,000 and is expected to  take at least two years, Hunt said.  </P> <P> He said converting the depot into a railroad museum has been planned for about  six years, but the district did not have the money for the renovation.  </P> <P> Hunt said the agreement with the Rancho Simi Foundation calls for most of the  renovation work to be done by volunteers and that material costs will be shared  by both the district and the community organization.  </P> <P> Walter Griffin, who heads the 50-member foundation, said his group has raised  more than $5,000 for renovation and hopes to begin work by August.  </P> <P> One of the planned exhibits will be a miniature model railroad being built by  Griffin's group that will replicate the Burbank-to-Oxnard line. The museum will  also feature an assortment of historical photographs and displays of various  railroad memorabilia. CARLOS V. LOZANO  </P></p>

			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Housing starts help Meyer to Pounds 19m MEYER INTERNATIONAL, the building products group, said yesterday that the fragile recovery in the UK housing market and thus the outlook for its own profits hinged on the Budget later this month. 'We would see a neutral budget as reasonably positive for our business,' said Mr John Dobby, chief executive, as he reported a jump in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 8.5m to Pounds 19m. Meyer was helped by the full benefit of a lower cost base after three years of cost-cutting. Sales in the six months to September 30 rose to Pounds 600.8m compared with Pounds 540.5m, stripping out a Pounds 17.7m contribution from Cadel, a plumbers' and heating merchants sold last year. Meyer, which raised Pounds 70m in a rights issue in April, is holding its interim dividend at 4.2p, payable from earnings up at 11.3p (5.9p restated), and expressed cautious optimism about prospects. It said: 'We have seen a modest increase in demand in the first six months and we have seen that continue in October and November to date.' Mr Dobby said Meyer had been helped by housing starts climbing 'steadily upwards' because of the 'direct relationship' with its main product, timber. He said prices had risen between 2.5 per cent and 3 per cent on an annualised basis after 'many years' of falls, with the price of timber lifted a little more. Operating profits rose to Pounds 24m (Pounds 17.9m). The 191-strong Jewson builders' merchants chain, which closed 11 branches last year, improved its contribution to Pounds 10.3m (Pounds 7.1m) on sales up at Pounds 215.1m (Pounds 209.4m). Meyer may add branches and said bad debts in the division fell to 0.74 per cent (1.5 per cent) of sales. Profits in the forest products division were Pounds 8.4m (Pounds 6.1m) on sales of Pounds 180.3m (Pounds 155.8m). In continental Europe profits were Pounds 6.5m (Pounds 5m) on sales ahead at Pounds 195.3m (Pounds 168.6m). US laminates delivered profits of Pounds 200,000 against last year's neutral contribution on sales ahead at Pounds 10.1m (Pounds 6.7m). Net interest payments fell to Pounds 5m (Pounds 6.8m) as the rights funds helped reduce net borrowings to Pounds 69.1m (Pounds 138.4m). Gearing was 20.6 per cent (53.9 per cent). COMMENT Loyal shareholders deserve some recovery after last year's dividend cut and stumping up for the rights issue which critics pin to the Pounds 63.4m net cost so far of Meyer's unhappier diversifications. The company is not alone in such mistakes and has some successes, such as Pont Meyer in the Netherlands and the US laminates business, to its credit. Taking the positive with the negative, analysts have upgraded full-year pre-tax forecasts to between Pounds 39.5m and Pounds 41m giving a range of multiples between 17 and 20 - in line with the sector. Buyers expect earnings growth on margin recovery.</p>

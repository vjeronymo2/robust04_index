			<p>BFN     [Text] Vienna, June 22 (XINHUA) -- Austria welcomes the  forthcoming official visit by Premier Li Peng, the first by a  Chinese chief of government, said Chancellor Franz Vranitzky  here today when interviewed by XINHUA reporters.    According to the chancellor bilateral relations have enjoyed  smooth development since his visit to China last April and he  stressed that economic cooperation is quite satisfactory.    The chancellor said he feels glad that a large economic  group  will accompany Premier Li during his European visit. He  suggested that the two countries have a future of cooperation in  a variety of economic fields, such as energy, transport and  sewage disposal, in which Austria has much experience.    "The two countries will sign a series of economic accords  during Li's visit to Austria," he said.    He spoke highly of China's socialist market economy and its  great economic achievements.    He stressed that Austria will not limit its attention within  Europe in spite of its formal EU membership from January 1,  1995, rather, it will attach more importance to the relationship  with countries and regions outside the continent.</p>

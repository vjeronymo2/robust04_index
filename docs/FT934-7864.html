			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Arts: Mae West, I'm No Angel - Musicals 'I feel like a million - but one at a time.' Who else? Had Mae West not invented herself, someone else would have concocted her. When I heard that I'm No Angel was a Mae West musical, I imagined one of those biography-with-songs shows - and feared the worst. As it turns out, I'm No Angel simply focuses on Mae during her 1948 season in London. She admits to 45, is discussed by journalists as 55 (but as looking 40) and is actually 57. She has her loyal old manager (Gordon Sterne) in tow (who may once have been the only man she truly loved) - and, while in London, she has an affair with an 18-year-old boxer (Paul McNeilly) and also starts a friendship with a 55-year-old nun (Philippa Urquhart). The boxer and the nun - both, I guess, fictitious - respectively draw out the flesh and the spirit in our Mae. Not that her flesh and spirit clash with each other; the author of I'm No Angel, Ayshe Raif, gives Mae an easy ride. Too easy, actually. Mae steams through her time in London, a determined symbol of sex and fun, and the main traumas that occur are in those around her: the boxer, the nun, the manager. Still, there is something terribly believable about that. The real Monstres sacres never doubt that they can sin and go to heaven; otherwise they wouldn't be sacres. Mae has her teenage hunk, she pays his mother hush money, and meanwhile she consults the nun, chiefly about her late mother. Yet she listens, too. We get to know the vulnerable sides of the lesser folk better than we do hers. I'm no Angel would be better if it showed just how terrifyingly invulnerable Mae is. What about the one-liners and the songs that Mae was famous for? They are here in plentiful supply. The jokes are ingeniously worked into the dialogue: Nun: 'I've heard so much about you'. Mae: 'But you can't prove a thing.' Nun, laughing: 'I laughed so much when I first heard that line.' The songs are simply part of Mae's routine - her London show, her daily work around which she fits in sex with the boxer and psycho talk with the nun. Lynda Baron plays Mae. Like the show, hers is a sightly superficial view of Mae, but my only big complaint is that her more vehement scenes lack force. She sings well - well enough to make you attend to all the wordplay in 'I Want to Feel that Lowdown Music Trickle Up my Spine'; and she speaks the way she sings. No doubt the original Mae had more bite, danger, voluptuousness. But Baron combines fun, heavy-eyed glamour, grit, and sheer camp, all with enough finesse to make you believe, at least, in her Mae. Patrick Sandford directs. Much of the first half's dialogue could be paced with more conviction, but the show runs smoothly and entertainingly. If it dared to take a more searching view of the ruthlessness, deceptions and doubts involved in preserving Mae West, it would be more memorable. More sexy also. As it is, it is a happy reminder of why Mae remains an icon. 'A lot of men like a gal with a past. They hope that history will repeat itself.' At the Nuffield Theatre, Southampton. 0703 671771</p>

			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Out of the red and into the Black: How an ailing British institution has been turned into a gold mine by the Canadian tycoon who rescued it AMONG remarkable success stories, the one about the British institution sold six years ago for Pounds 30m, and which next week will announce a pre-tax profit for last year of Pounds 40.5m - some 35 per cent more than the purchase price, in spite of the worst recession since the Second World War - takes some beating. But the profit is only part of it; for the story also is one of an investment that has, incredibly, multiplied 1,500 per cent. The institution is the Daily Telegraph newspaper, which had been controlled by the aristocratic Berry family since 1928 but was on the verge of bankruptcy in December 1985. In the six months to September that year, the paper had lost Pounds 16m. In February 1986, control was bought by a Canadian tycoon named Conrad Black, who was almost unknown outside his native country but is now, aged 47, in the process of assembling a newspaper empire that recently swallowed Australia's influential Fairfax group. For more than 30 years until its sale, the Telegraph had been run by two men  -Lord Hartwell, now 80, who became chairman and editor-in-chief in 1954; and his brother, Viscount Camrose, now 82, who had been deputy chairman since 1939. They remain on the board as non-executive directors representing what used to be the all-powerful Berry family trust. But both must have very mixed feelings as they contemplate the turnround in their old company's fortunes. Indeed, they must wonder if they made a very serious mistake in selling for what, in hindsight, seems almost a giveaway sum - especially since their former fiefdom is now valued at a minimum of Pounds 500m and, possibly, as much as Pounds 1bn. Hartwell and Camrose used to work in splendid isolation on the fifth floor of their old headquarters at 135 Fleet Street, in the one-time heart of the UK newspaper industry. Hartwell had a suite to one side of the wood-panelled boardroom, Camrose had one on the other. In the space between, executives would tell them what they wanted to hear as the Telegraph slid towards the abyss - ironically, because a belated attempt at modernisation was bungled. Vast spending on new printing plant in the Docklands of east London had been committed - without adequate financing or an effective plan to reduce the exorbitant wage costs of the print workers - at a time when both advertising and circulation were dropping. It proved a fatal combination. Effectively, the Berry family lost control of the Telegraph in the Kennedy Hilton hotel at New York's JFK airport on May 28 1985, when Hartwell persuaded Black to invest Pounds 10m in the hard-pressed newspaper group in exchange for a 14 per cent shareholding. The ambitious Canadian had been alerted to the investment opportunity by a British friend, Andrew Knight, then editor of The Economist news-magazine and later Black's chief executive at the Telegraph. But, in one far-sighted move at the meeting, Black laid the foundation of his media empire by demanding pre-emptive rights on any further issue of shares. 'I don't think we can resist that,' said Hartwell, convinced that no further money would be needed. 'In that moment, without realising it, he gave his birthright away,' comments Duff Hart-Davis in his book, The House the Berrys Built. Black is fond of describing the deal as 'not the sort you expect to get two of in a lifetime.' But how could the Toronto-based owner of a string of small-town North American newspapers, with little knowledge of Fleet Street and its then all-powerful printing unions, save the near-moribund Telegraph, restricted as it was by tradition, debt, and corrupt labour practices? Although the Telegraph, founded in June 1855 during the Crimean War, never occupied such a central role at the heart of the establishment as The Times, it was for generations the authentic voice of upper middle class England. For a long time, it outsold the rest of the daily 'quality' press put together. Even now, it sells more than 2.5 times as many copies as The Guardian, which leads the rest of the pack. But, despite these strengths, when Black took over it was on its knees commercially. Black foresaw in May 1985 that Hartwell would be unable to meet his budget plans. By December, it was clear that a new injection of cash would soon be needed; this, under the rights agreement, would enable Black to gain a majority shareholding. But an awkward period ensued while Black, who had a seat on the Telegraph board, put together a team ready to take over. He told Knight, who was still editor of The Economist, to lay his plans for becoming chief executive. Knight arranged a dinner with Frank Rogers, one of the wisest heads in Fleet Street. Rogers was a former Fleet Street sports reporter who had also managed papers in Africa, been managing director of the huge IPC Magazines group, and chairman of another publishing group, EMAP. Black, a somewhat forbidding figure, hit it off with the benignly mischievous Rogers, who was then approaching normal retiring age. Black then persuaded Hartwell to give Rogers a seat on the board and promised that Rogers would become deputy chairman - a position he still holds. He also brought in Joe Cooke, a soft-spoken Irish management consultant with a background in engineering, as an adviser. Cooke knew little about national newspapers - but plenty about manning and cost-cutting in large-scale industry. Once, when he reorganised one of Britain's biggest double-glazing operations, working hours were increased and labour costs cut to one-third. He was to become the new Telegraph's managing director. Only three months after this 'management in waiting' had been assembled, Knight, Rogers and Cooke were implementing a similar plan to reduce overmanning and excess wages in the printing operation. But, as 'highly confidential' documents of the time show, the battle was not just with the unions. The first salvoes of opposition were fired by the paper's old-guard management which wanted to tip-toe to reform in the traditional way. Its own plan for cutting manpower at the new Docklands plant had been extremely modest. On Friday December 20, Hartwell summoned Knight to his office and told him to stop giving orders to his executives. But the management-in-waiting already knew what it wanted. Early in January, Cooke drafted a revolutionary plan for survival that involved challenging the print unions head-on. This came at much the same time as Australian-born media tycoon Rupert Murdoch also was planning a similar confrontation. His Fleet Street operations, like those at the Telegraph and everywhere else in national newspapers, were still subject to a labyrinth of demarcation agreements, ghost shifts, double manning and other restrictive practices. The old Telegraph management did not have stomach for the fight, though. At a meeting on Sunday, December 22, a majority of the board decided that 10 per cent savings was all that could be obtained in Manchester, and that setting maximum wage costs - as the Black team wanted - was not appropriate for a newspaper printing plant. Cooke recalls: 'They said that when I had been in newspapers long enough, I would find out that all the money was made from advertising. You didn't make money from printing plants and I was very foolish to think you did.' The new guard went underground to plan for the day it would take power although it did manage, in December, to insist that negotiations with the unions should be suspended. By then, Cooke had picked-up rumours of Murdoch's intention to switch all his titles - including The Times, The Sunday Times, The Sun and the News of the World - to a new, ultra-modern plant in Docklands. The plan was to wait until Murdoch had moved; this actually happened later in January 1985. Unlike Murdoch, who shifted his entire operation more or less overnight and ignored the unions, the Telegraph's aim was to present each of them with a fait accompli, delivered at carefully-timed meetings, with no group of employees having access to the big picture. 'What we were concerned to avoid was an instant trigger response with somebody going on strike. Once they're out, its a hell of a job to get them back. If you got over the first day, you'd effectively won,' says Cooke. In the end, the day for action was set as March 26 1986, and the plan was named Operation Blackbird. Union chapels (local branches) were told, at half-hourly intervals, that the Fleet Street headquarters was being closed and operations were being transferred to a new one in Docklands. Anyone who wanted to work there would have to accept new terms: five days a week working instead of four, and Pounds 80 a shift rather than Pounds 125. Redundancy payments of up to Pounds 45,000 were offered. The printers did not go on strike; indeed, union representatives, having by now heard of the master plan, started to enter meetings singing Bye Bye Blackbird. For Black, the outcome was remarkable. At 135 Fleet Street, there had been 1,637 printing jobs costing Pounds 40m a year. The old guard's presentation to banks in the autumn of 1985 had envisaged 1,292 jobs costing Pounds 39m in Docklands. The deal agreed finally was for 679 jobs costing Pounds 16m. The managers then turned to the more subtle and problematical task of modernising the appearance and content of the Telegraph, and the even more demanding challenge of trying to halt an apparently inevitable slide in circulation. Max Hastings, then a columnist on the London Evening Standard, was brought in as editor to shake out the cobwebs. The most serious problem was an ageing readership. 'The undertakers have dispatched 300,000 subscribers since I took over,' says Black, mournfully. If none of those readers had been replaced, the paper would long since have slipped below the symbolic 1m circulation mark. Instead, the pace of circulation loss has declined, despite price increases from 23p in 1985 to the present 45p, and the recession. In 1980, the average circulation was 1.44m. Five years later, it was 1.21m. Last year, it dropped to 1.067m. The recent decline has, however, been much less than that of its two main broadsheet rivals, The Times and The Independent. The change in the paper's appearance has been even more dramatic. Cover up the date and the tight, grey, poorly-illustrated columns of only six years ago could have passed for any issue in the previous 40 years. The new Telegraph has clean layout, a sharper approach and a growing confidence with pictures - what Hastings calls 'progressive change by stealth.' Less obviously, the political tone and image of the paper has been manipulated gently. The Telegraph always can be relied-on to argue vigorously for the return of another Conservative government. Yet, the paper now is less rampantly right-wing and the days are past when no one under 40 would want to be seen with a copy. In turn, critics say that its long-standing 'Torygraph' nickname has merely given way to a new one: the 'Hellograph,' a reference to the successful but bland and uncritical celebrity magazine called Hello. On balance, Black prefers the new caricature to that of the old Colonel Blimp. Perhaps the most telling symbol of the new Daily Telegraph is the recently poaching of Alex, a popular Yuppie cartoon character, from The Independent - the daily founded by former Telegraph staff several years ago and which was supposed to sink their former employer. Black says that poaching Alex is a warning that the Telegraph is flexing its muscles again.</p>

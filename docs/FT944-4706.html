			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / Brussels to re-examine UK's Pounds 61m grant for textile plant The European Commission is to re-examine its approval this year of a Pounds 61m UK government grant for a textiles plant to be built by Hualon of Taiwan in Belfast. It suspects information it received from UK authorities was inaccurate. Mr Karel Van Miert, the competition commissioner, will write to the UK Department of Trade and Industry, asking it to clarify evidence given by the government about the project and its likely impact on the European textiles market. Commission officials said if the department failed to provide satisfactory answers, the case would be reopened. That might lead to Brussels prohibiting the grant and ordering the government to recover any money paid to Hualon. The Commission approved the subsidy to Hualon, one of Taiwan's biggest industrial groups, in May, after intense lobbying by UK ministers. They were supported by Mr Jacques Delors, outgoing president of the European Commission, in the interests of underpinning the Northern Ireland peace process. Brussels accepted the UK government's arguments that the plant would not disrupt the European textiles market, in that it would supply synthetic fibre to low-cost clothing manufacturers in Europe, and that its output would substitute for imports from outside the European Union. However, Mr Van Miert is now seeking further assurances that the plant will not add to excess capacity in the European textiles industry by producing high-quality products that will undercut existing manufacturers and create unemployment. 'At the time (of the approval) we were convinced that production was at the lower end of the market,' said a senior commission official yesterday. 'But some doubt has come up and now we want reassurances. If not, we will have to look into the files.' Last week, European textiles and clothing manufacturers challenged the Commission's decision in the European Court. They argue that the Pounds 157m plant will threaten jobs in an already over-supplied sector. Britain has long prided itself on a rigorous application of EU competition rules and regularly complains when state aids in steel and the airline industry are handed out in other member states. The timing of Mr Van Miert's re-examination is doubly sensitive, as the UK government is expected to win at least Pounds 250m in special EU aid to Northern Ireland at this week's European Council in Essen. Next week, it hosts an international conference in Northern Ireland, to attract investment to the region.</p>

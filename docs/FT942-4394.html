			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / Schneider slushfund claim A Swiss businessman has told French and Swiss newspapers that he administered for Groupe Schneider a 'slush fund' of which Mr Didier Pineau-Valencienne, president of the French group charged with fraud, may have known nothing. In interviews published yesterday with Paris Match magazine and the Nouveau Quotidien de Lausanne, Mr Luc Jacquier said he managed a Swiss trust company called Finamines. This was set up by the Belgian Empain group - itself later absorbed in Schneider - to help run its mining interests in Zaire after the latter's independence in 1960 from Belgium. Finamines in turn 'had relations with the Panamanian holding companies of Mitraco and Tramico,' according to Mr Jacquier, and these two companies received a considerable amount of money from the 1960s to the mid-1980s. For tax reasons, Mr Jacquier said the existence of Mitraco and Tramico was kept secret from shareholders of Cofibel and Cofimines, in which Schneider had a stake. Minority shareholders in Cofibel and Cofimines said Schneider had not given them good enough terms in buying them out in 1992. This eventually launched the Belgian judicial inquiry which in turn landed Mr Pineau-Valencienne in jail. Mr Pineau-Valencienne was eventually released on FFr2.5m (Pounds 290,000) bail. Mr Jacquier's reported comments - on which the Schneider group said yesterday it had no comment - would appear to point the finger at Mr Jean Verdoot, who managed Schneider's interests in Belgium until his death in an air crash two years ago.</p>

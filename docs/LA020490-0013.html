			<p><P> February 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FARRAKHAN SAYS U.S. SHOULD VIEW NATION OF ISLAM AS FRIEND  </P> <P> Minister Louis Farrakhan granted a rare one-on-one interview to Times staff  writer Andrea Ford on Saturday. Farrakhan, controversial leader of the Nation  of Islam, was in Los Angeles for a Friday night speech at the Los Angeles  Sports Arena.  </P> <P>  In the interview, which was limited to 20 minutes, Farrakhan repeated  assertions that the war on drugs is a disguised war on blacks by the  government. He also said the Nation of Islam is dedicated to eliminating drugs  and that the government should view the Nation of Islam as a friend, not an  enemy.  </P> <P>  Following is a partial transcript of the interview.  </P> <P> Q: What did you hope to accomplish with this visit to Los Angeles, and did you  accomplish it?  </P> <P> A: Always our aim is to teach and guide our people to that which will give them  a better life and a better grip on themselves that we might come into a  stronger bond of unity. . . . I believe that last night, certainly a beginning  was made. . . . The Crips and the Bloods were there and even though they find  it difficult relating one to the other, it appeared they found ease in relating  to me and to us. We might possibly serve as a link to bring together those  factions in our community that up to this point have not been able to find the  path to unity.  </P> <P> Q: In your speech you said the government's war on drugs is a disguised war on  the black community. Could you elaborate on that?  </P> <P> A: We believe that the government . . . is frightened by the rise in population  of our people. We believe (the government) sees in black people a useless  population that is considered by sociologists a permanent underclass. And when  you have something that is useless, you attempt to get rid of it, if you cannot  make it serviceable. . . . And just as Mr. Bush used the war on drugs as a  pretext to bomb and invade Panama . . . we believe that same scenario is being  put in place to attack the black community.  </P> <P> Q: Beyond unity, do you have a specific plan or proposal to try to cure some of  the ills plaguing the African-American community, the gang warfare, the drug  problem?  </P> <P> A: Yes, of course. One could not come to the black community today as a servant  if one does not have some solution to these problems. Most of these that you  see that are with me in the Nation are those that we retrieved from the  streets, from prisons, from a very low life . . . and we have by God's grace  reformed these men and women, taken them from the old life style and given them  a life style that is in harmony (with) the prophets of God. So if we can do it  for the few, that is a sign that we can do it for the many if we are given a  chance. When they are trying to find a cure for something, they measure what  (the medicine does) with that small sampling, then they spread the sampling,  then they get federal approval and give the medicine to all that suffer from  that disease. I would hope that ultimately the government would see the Nation  of Islam, not as the enemy, but the Nation of Islam as a friend.  </P> <P> Q: Do you believe the perception of you as perhaps anti-Jewish decreases your  effectiveness in spreading your message to a wider audience of Americans?  </P> <P> A: No, not at all. It has increased it. In fact, in 1985, when I came to Los  Angeles, if it had not been for the Jewish community making the kind of issue  that they made of my presence, we might not have filled the Forum. And 19,000  people came to the Forum to see and hear this man who had the Jewish community  so upset. Jews have never been upset over any black person. They usually have  great control over black people. But here's one they don't control, and they  have not yet found the mechanism to destroy what they can't control. And so it  causes them great consternation. However, as I said last night, I am not  anti-Semitic, nor am I anti-Jewish.  </P> <P> Q: In your speech you described the black community and Los Angeles  specifically as being on the brink of eruption. What do you mean?  </P> <P> A: This is not just in Los Angeles. All over the country, police killings of  black people are on the increase. And when a human being's life is taken, the  law of justice says that loss of life must be justified. . . . Now millions of  lives of black people have been lost and there has been no redress for that  grievance. So something is building in the breasts of black folk and if wise  measures are not taken at this juncture, this could explode in a volcanic  eruption.  </P> <P> Q: Is Louis Farrakhan being irresponsible, as some say, by telling people they  have every right to erupt? Are you giving license to rage?  </P> <P> A: I cannot give license to rage. It is injustice that gives license to rage.  Since I did not commit the crimes that have the black community enraged, then  it is not I who gives license to the rage. . . . The people don't need a leader  to direct their rage, they know who they are enraged against.  </P></p>

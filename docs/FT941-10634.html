			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / International Company News: Danish bank returns to black Unidanmark, the second-largest Danish banking group, reported a return to profit in 1993 after three consecutive years in the red. Net profit was DKr885m (Dollars 132m), compared with a loss in 1992 of DKr4.66bn and losses in 1990 and 1991 of DKr1.09bn and DKr1.65bn respectively. The group omitted a dividend for the second year, but announced a DKr550m new share issue at market price and without preferential rights for existing shareholders which should raise about DKr1.3bn. A cut in bad loss provisions to DKr3.88bn last year from DKr6.28bn and income from securities and foreign exchange of DKr2.56bn, compared with a loss of DKr273m in 1992, helped the turnround. The increase in profits from securities and foreign exchange reflected the sharp rise in bond and share prices last year. Mr Thorleif Krarup, group chief executive, said about DKr1.5bn of the DKr2.5bn profit under this heading were trading profits and the rest a gain in the value of securities. Mr Krarup was brought into the bank in the autumn of 1992 after repeated forecasts of an improved performance were falsified. He supervised a reduction in costs last year by 7 per cent to DKr5.99bn, including a cut in the workforce to 10,108 people from 11,877 at the end of 1992. The new share issue, to be marketed in Europe and the US, will increase the bank's core capital from 7.2 per cent to 8.0 per cent and its total capital adequacy ratio to over 12 per cent from 11.8 per cent at the end of last year, the bank said. The group's total assets increased to DKr242bn from DKr219bn in 1992. For the first time for many years the group's deposits, which increased to DKr127.4bn from DKr114.9bn in 1992, exceeded advances, which declined to DKr125.5bn from DKr132.5bn in 1992 and a peak of DKr158bn in 1990. Increasing competition and reduced volatility in the securities and foreign exchange markets will have an adverse effect on profits in 1994, the bank said, but it made no earnings forecast.</p>

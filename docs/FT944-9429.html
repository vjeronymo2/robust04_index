			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Norway warming to Europe Norwegians are increasingly warming to the idea of European Union membership and more people are taking a stand on the issue although opposition to the move continues to hold a clear lead, according to four opinion polls undertaken after Sweden voted to join the European Union. Since Sweden's Yes vote on Sunday, Norway has stepped up its campaign to convince a reluctant electorate to approve membership in a referendum on November 28. The surveys revealed that the Yes camp has narrowed the gap by between 5-6 percentage points and has gathered support for the move from 38.3 per cent of the voters. But those opposed retain a strong lead, increasing support for a No vote by just under one percentage point to an average 47 per cent. The sharpest movement in the polls was by those undecided where the figures dropped sharply to an average 14.8 per cent from 20.8 per cent.</p>

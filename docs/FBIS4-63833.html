			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS special correspondents Dmitriy Gorokhov </F> and Albert Maloveryan]    [Text] Tallinn 25 May -- An appeal of military pensioners  to dwell on the Estonian discriminative policy on military  pensioners was passed over by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev to his Estonian counterpart Uri Luik, who chaired a  session of ministers from the Council of Baltic Sea States.    Speaking at the forum, the Russian official stressed the  council's role in organization of regional cooperation. He  called for the consolidation of the council and specification of  its activities.    The session is expected to elect the council's commissioner  for human rights and ethnic minorities. Russia is ready to help  him and his staffers in fulfilment of their duties on Russian  territory. Andrey Kozyrev hopes that the commissioner will help  settle some Russian-Estonian problems.    The Russian delegation is expected to circulate two  memoranda  during the session -- one on human rights and the other on  economic partnership -- in order to give a fresh impetus to  cooperation in these spheres. Russia supports the consolidation  of the council's organizational mechanisms and favors close  coordination of efforts taken by the council chairman, his  successor and predecessor.    The current session is attended by foreign ministers from  Germany, Denmark, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Poland, the Russian  Federation, Finland, Sweden and Estonia, as well as  representatives of the Commission of the European Union. The  agenda includes regional cooperation, ecological and nuclear  safety in the Baltic Sea area, interaction with states-members  of the European Union and other regional problems. A joint  communique will be adopted on the session results.</p>

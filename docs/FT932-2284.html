			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / CBI chief attacks London strategy MR HOWARD Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, yesterday launched a stinging attack on the government's failure to formulate a strategy for developing London as a leading European business centre. Speaking at a CBI conference on the future of the capital, Mr Davies accused the cabinet sub-committee set up to co-ordinate policy on London of behaving secretively and failing to involve others in its work. 'To most business people the establishment of the sub-committee has been a non-event,' he said. 'It has been meeting for a year, or so I imagine. But the UK's obsession for secrecy means that no one outside its close circle knows what it has achieved, or what it hopes to achieve, or how it plans to measure its performance in the future.' Mr Davies also called for progress on improving transport in London, including projects such as the extension of the Jubilee Underground line and the CrossRail project. Both schemes have been delayed by the government's desire to raise part of the cost through private sector finance. 'There is a danger that the whole government private-finance initiative will be discredited unless real holes can be dug in the ground pretty soon,' he said. Earlier at the conference Mr John Gummer, the new environment secretary, said that he regarded London as a 'top priority'. He urged Londoners to bring forward suggestions on improving the city, and said that he was considering publishing a 'framework document' for the capital in the autumn. This would 'celebrate our city, describe our achievements, reflect the views of Londoners and throw out new ideas.' Mr Davies said, however, that it was hard to be optimistic about London's prospects in competing with other European cities. While business had launched initiatives such as London First and London Forum to improve the capital's infrastructure and promote it abroad, there was no overall strategic body analysing London's problems and planning solutions. It was clear, he said, that other European governments played a much greater role in formulating strategic plans for developing their capital cities. Mr Davies called on the sub-committee to publish an assessment of London's strengths and weaknesses, and its plans for dealing with the latter. It should be supported by a special office with staff from all the departments with an interest in London, such as environment, trade and industry, employment and transport. The government should also improve its co-ordination with bodies such as London First and the chambers of commerce, he said. It should support the creation of a London centre to bring together initiatives such as London Forum and the First Stop Shop for inward investors being developed by the City Corporation, Westminster City Council and the London Docklands Development Corporation.</p>

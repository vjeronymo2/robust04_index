			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / Kohl warns of nationalist revival EUROPE is facing a revival of nationalist thinking, intolerance and even chauvinism, in the west as well as the east, according to Mr Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor. The threat makes ever closer European integration, leading to ultimate European union, all the more essential, he argues in an article written for today's Financial Times. In an urgent plea for continuing progress towards political as well as economic union, beyond the 'interim step' of the Maastricht treaty, Mr Kohl rejects the idea of a 'two-speed or three-speed Europe'. At the same time, he says Germany 'cannot accept a Europe, the speed of which is dictated by the slowest ship in the convoy'. 'We have more neighbours than any other country in Europe,' he says, 'so we have a fundamental national interest in creating a European union to which, one day, all our neighbours will belong.' While praising the 'decisive role' of the European Community in helping to overcome 'traditional rivalries and policies of national egoism', he warns of the dangers of new nationalism. 'I doubt whether the evil spirits of the past . . . have really been banished for good. No one should be under the illusion that the spectre of European nationalism has finally been laid to rest, nor that this ugly apparition is confined only to the Balkans . . . Even western Europe is not immune to such temptations.' He warns against 'people stirring up public sentiment with the argument that Germany has become too large and too powerful, and therefore needs to be 'contained' by means of coalitions. It is a cruel irony that this kind of talk plays into the hands of precisely those forces, not least in Germany, which propagate old-style nationalism'. To those who fear that the pace of integration is too fast and that Maastricht is too ambitious, he asks: 'Can we afford to go more slowly?'

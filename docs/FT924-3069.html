			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / US troops land in Somalia at start of aid effort US NAVY commandos came ashore on Somali beaches before dawn today to begin the biggest foreign military and humanitarian operation ever undertaken in Africa. The landings, televised live worldwide, pave the way for a US-led multinational intervention force of at least 35,000 troops, including 28,000 Americans. There was no shooting and the biggest obstacles troops faced were hordes of reporters and cameramen. In Washington, president-elect Bill Clinton indicated that the troops might stay in Somalia after his inauguration on January 20, the target date set by President George Bush for the operation to end. He said there was 'merit' in the UN-authorised intervention - to disarm local warlords and ensure food aid reaches the starving - and added: 'An artificial timetable cannot be imposed.' The first Americans to come ashore on a Mogadishu beach were frogmen, closely followed by marine reconnaissance forces in rubber boats. The commandos walked up the beach and shook hands with a contingent of Pakistani UN troops who have camped nearby for the past few months. Advance units of Marines also landed at Mogadishu airport. US Marines in armoured amphibious tractors from the USS Juneau then set about establishing beachheads for further landings by some 1,800 troops, backed by attack helicopters. The troops planned to move quickly to disarm local gunmen who have been thwarting the international operation to get humanitarian aid to starving Somalis. Scores of reporters and photographers were at the port and airport as the troops moved in, and the first landings were televised live at prime viewing time in the US via satellite dishes. Reporters even tried to interview troops as they headed up the beach and cameramen with portable arc lights televised commandos as they squatted self-consciously in hastily found foxholes. Mogadishu's residents were tense and anxious last night ahead of the landings. There was a slight upsurge of wild firing of guns as heavily armed vehicles continued moving out of the city. Somalia's two top warlords broadcast appeals urging their fighters to co-operate with US forces and withdraw their 'Mad Max' vehicles - converted armoured desert jeeps - from the rubble-strewn streets of the capital. Mr Robert Oakley, US ambassador at large, met the two warlords controlling the capital and said he recognised that neither man had full control over the bands of marauding gunmen who speed around the city and could still create problems for US troops. Aid agencies ordered their staff to stay at home in case they got caught in crossfire or became targets of kidnappings by gunmen who face the loss of their racketeering way of life. An advance party of French troops was also expected to arrive early today in Mogadishu. Media event, Page 4</p>

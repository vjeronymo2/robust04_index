			<p><P> June 22, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COURT TO DECIDE TODAY ON RAPPAPORT ADMINISTRATOR  </P> <P> When David Rappaport -- the 3-foot-11 actor who appeared in "L.A. Law" and the  movie "Time Bandits" -- committed suicide last month, his family had no idea  that the nightmare would drag on so long and that the aftermath would be so  complicated.  </P> <P> Rappaport died without leaving a will, and in the seven weeks since his death,  a snag in California probate law has brought trouble ranging from the attempted  eviction of his fiancee -- Eliza Lende -- from the Hollywood Hills home the two  shared for five years, to repeated efforts by social workers to claim the  actor's clothes and car for possible sale.  </P> <P> Today, a Los Angeles Superior Court probate commissioner will decide whether  the county, which has claimed jurisdiction of the case, must turn the  administration of Rappaport's U.S. estate -- estimated by the family's attorney  at $400,000 to $500,000 -- over to Frankie Leigh, Rappaport's cousin and  business manager, as the actor's family has asked.  </P> <P> Legally, the estate wound up in the county's hands for two reasons: Rappaport  died without a will, and his heir -- the actor's 14-year-old son, Joseph -- is  a British citizen. Under state law, a foreigner may not administer the estate  of a California resident, and may not even appoint an administrator.  </P> <P> Practically, some observers of the case have suggested that the county -- which  is typically too overburdened with the estates of poor people who die with no  relatives to step in where it doesn't have to -- grabbed onto this case because  of its notoriety and because the probate fees from a large estate can help  cover the costs of administering smaller ones.  </P> <P> Gene Kent, manager of public administrator operations for the county, said that  the county did have to step in.  </P> <P> "We're kind of a stakeholder, holding onto it until everything can get sorted  out at the court level," Kent said. "The problem is that not one of the  arrangements (that the family wants to make) was solidified in writing. So  we're trying to protect all parties."  </P> <P> Most of Rappaport's estate -- trust funds, savings, investments -- was kept in  England, according to Jeff Wheeler, the Rappaport family's attorney. In the  United States, he held only enough cash for day-to-day living, along with his  house, clothes and car.  </P> <P> The county, Kent said, is trying to make the estate more liquid, to generate  cash both to increase the value of the estate and to pay for administrative  costs. Accordingly, he said, his office has been attempting to induce Lende to  pay rent or leave the house, and would like to sell the actor's possessions.  </P> <P> To the family, the county's actions have been insensitive and intrusive.  </P> <P> "The public administrator came to the door to lock up the car and seal it  away," said Leigh. "They turned off the gas, electricity and water, then they  turned off the phone and put a notice on the door, a 30-day notice to quit."  </P> <P> While the county did agree to hold off taking possession of Rappaport's car,  the family's appeals have fallen mostly on deaf ears, Leigh and Wheeler said.  </P> <P> "I spoke to the counsel for the public administrator, and, frankly, I have not  had more discussions with opposing counsel that I have disliked more," said  Wheeler. "It became clear to me that he had this almost proprietary interest in  the Rappaport estate, and then he implied that the family's desire to have  Frankie as administrator was really a cover-up for mismanagement of the  estate."  </P> <P> The whole situation could have been avoided had Rappaport prepared a will.  </P> <P> "That's why you have a will," said attorney Allan Cutrow, an estate and trust  specialist with the firm Mitchell, Silberberg and Knupp. "If you were to ask  most probate lawyers about the kind of work we do on the litigation side, at  least 60% of it is sorting out the relationships among people who were not  provided for in the will."  </P> <P> For this morning's hearing, the family has adopted a tactic that has worked in  past cases: Leigh, a U.S. citizen, has been appointed as guardian of heir  Joseph Rappaport's U.S. interests by the boy's mother in England. Wheeler said  that he will ask the court to consider her, as guardian, to be legally  qualified to administer the estate.  </P> <P> But even if the tactic is successful, the court may choose not to make her  administrator until the guardianship becomes permanent in August. The family  fears that such a delay would enable the county to force Lende out of the house  and to sell Rappaport's possessions.  </P> <P> "It becomes an issue of personalities versus potential (legal) arguments," said  James Birnberg, a leading estate and probate attorney with the firm Loeb &amp;  Loeb, who was interviewed about the case. "As a matter of public policy, given  that its role may be temporary, (the county) should not take irreversible  steps. You have to look at it from a human point of view."  </P></p>

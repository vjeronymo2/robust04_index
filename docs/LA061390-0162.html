			<p><P> June 13, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> SHEEN JOINS FOLGERS BOYCOTT  </P> <P> Actor Martin Sheen urged a supermarket chain to boycott Folgers coffee to  persuade Procter &amp; Gamble to stop buying beans from war-torn El Salvador.  </P> <P> Sheen joined a demonstration in Beverly Hills Tuesday by about three dozen  people outside a shareholders meeting of the Arden supermarket chain.  </P> <P> The boycott was started in November by peace organizations to protest the  slayings in El Salvador of six Jesuit priests. Salvadoran military officers  have been implicated in the killings.  </P> <P> "My country should not be funding the killers of the Jesuit priests with our  tax dollars or our consumer dollars," Sheen said.  </P> <P> An Arden spokesman, Ernest Klinger, said the company would continue to stock  Folgers to give consumers a full selection.  </P> <P> Don Tassone of P&amp;G, which makes Folgers, called the boycott "preposterous."  He said that P&amp;G buys coffee from at least 30 countries and that the  Salvadoran product amounts to less than 2% of the coffee in Folgers.  </P></p>

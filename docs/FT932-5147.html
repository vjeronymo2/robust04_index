			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / Clinton drops liberal for civil rights job: Black professor stays loyal A BATTERED President Bill Clinton yesterday got a helping hand from the woman he had dropped the night before as his nominee to run the Justice Department's civil rights division. As Washington reverberated with condemnations of the president from black, civil rights and women's groups, Ms Lani Guinier, precise in speech and dignified in her disappointment beyond all reasonable expectations, stood by the man she has known as a friend for more than 20 years. She disagreed with his decision to withdraw her nomination for the job and said she thought that, had she been allowed to testify before the Senate, she would have won confirmation. A possible administration 'mistake,' she said, was to allow her opponents 'to define me in ways my mother would not recognise'. But Ms Guinier, flanked by her husband and young son, insisted repeatedly at a press conference held in the department in which she desperately hoped to serve that she retained great respect for Mr Clinton and agreed with him that 'the last thing we need in this country is a discussion on race that polarises people'. He still had, she said, 'the opportunity to be a great president,' and she harboured no doubts about his commitment to 'heal the racial haemorrhaging' in the country. She was equally effusive in her praise of Ms Janet Reno, the attorney general, who had continued to support her but who said yesterday that 'it is now time to move on'. Mr Clinton, looking quite shattered, had finally pulled the rug from under her nomination on Thursday evening after what he called a 'most painful' two-hour White House session with Ms Guinier, now a law professor at Pennsylvania University. She had come under attack for academic articles which appeared to promote a form of proportional representation for ethnic minorities. Though she argued that her critics misunderstood her, Mr Clinton came to see her as a political embarrassment, and as the centre of a divisive debate, just when he is seeking wide Congressional backing on economic issues. It emerged that Mr Clinton had only read for the first time on Thursday the academic articles that led to Ms Guinier, who is black, being attacked as 'a quota queen' who would tinker with the voting rights laws. He said they contained 'ideas that I myself cannot embrace'. But Ms Guinier simply said yesterday she was 'flattered' that a president should have read her dense, abstract articles. She said, in fact, her steadfast opposition to racial quotas stemmed from the experience of her father at Harvard in 1929, when he was denied financial aid, because it had already been offered to one black, and refused permission to live in dormitories. 'He was the victim of racial quotas,' she said, 'a quota of one.' Of the attacks on her, she said, 'I hope we are not witnessing the dawn of a new intellectual orthodoxy in which thoughtful people can no longer debate provocative ideas without denying the country their talents as public servants.' But the power and authority of her remarks also had to be matched against the stream of criticisms directed at Mr Clinton and his White House, especially from the 38 strong congressional black caucus, among the president's most loyal supporters to date. Some threatened to withdraw support from his budget package, for which he needs every vote in sight.</p>

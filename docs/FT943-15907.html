			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Full-time worker numbers reduced As many as 38 per cent of Britain's workers are no longer in full-time permanent employment according to figures released today. About 9.7m people are either part-timers, in temporary jobs, self-employed, on a government training scheme or an unpaid family worker, a rise of 1.25m since 1986, says the government's Employment Gazette. The proportion of men in employment who are part of the flexible workforce has risen to 3.7m - 27 per cent from 18 per cent eight years ago. Among women it has remained stable at about 50 per cent, or 5.9m.</p>

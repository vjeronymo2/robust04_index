			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Yelena Kalyadina: "Peter the Great Opened a </F> Window onto Europe but Boris Opened a Door. Russia in  Partnership and Cooperation with the European Union. A  Successful Choice, It Seems"]    [Excerpt] Corfu-Moscow -- Russian foreign policy has made  a headlong rush into the West's embrace. Confirming by his  signature in Brussels Russia's agreement to take part in NATO's  Partnership for Peace program, Andrey Kozyrev picked up a new  document and headed immediately for the Greek island of Corfu.  The following day the 12 leaders of the European Union [EU] and  Boris Yeltsin signed the agreement on partnership and  cooperation.    Emerging from the solemn ceremony into the throng of waiting  journalists with a smile as dazzling as the sun over this  stunning Greek island, Boris Nikolayevich gave the following  reason for that smile: "The agreement is good for us. Because  it removes Europe's discriminatory approach toward economic ties  with Russia and thereby averts a new `cold war' -- an economic  one -- which was looming."    I think that we ordinary Russians should share the  president's joyful satisfaction. Why?    First, we have every reason to be proud of the fact that we  signed this document not as some poor relative who had suddenly  turned up but as equal partners. True, we were not the first of  the former brothers from the former Union with whom Europe has  officially formalized its ties. That was Ukraine. However, for  Russia, which is now experiencing far from the happiest times in  relations with its independent [samostiynyy] neighbor, this is  certainly no cause for sorrow. The laurels that the EU bestowed  on Ukraine for coming first does not mean that the EU is banking  on Kravchuk, for whom the agreement undoubtedly was a trump card  in the election campaign. In the past the EU had quite a few  criticisms of Kravchuk's economic course. The Europeans were  also alarmed by the Ukrainian saga over the non-nuclear status.  But by offering Ukraine partnership and cooperation, the EU  secured a means of influence over it. The latest example of  that is the decision adopted on Corfu on the closure of the  Chernobyl Nuclear Power Station. In addition, the agreement  with Ukraine does not promise it the degree of equality which is  envisaged by the agreement with Russia.    To be fair it has to be noted that we did not get our  equality easily. Initially the EC (as it then was) offered us  something that was more the illusion of equality.    Gradually and -- paradoxically as it may seem -- under the  pressure of our domestic political confusion, the Europeans  succumbed. But at the talks that were held two substantial  stumbling blocks remained -- uranium and banks. France, which  accounts for 60 percent of the stocks of enriched uranium in the  EU market, was afraid of an "explosive" influx of cheap nuclear  materials from Russia. Just 10 days before the signing of the  agreement a compromise was reached whereby Russia's nuclear  materials were included in the agreement along with other  commodities while the EU retains the right to use certain  instruments of commercial protection until 1997. Finally, Boris  Yeltsin's recent edict lifting the ban on the activity of five  foreign banks in Russia also removed the final question mark  over the Greek accord.    So what are we getting out of it?    In the political sphere our relations with the Europeans are  moving toward the kind of level that they have with the United  States and Japan. It is envisaged that the EU and Russia will  coordinate their positions on the main international questions  and, if necessary, will put forward joint political initiatives.    Then there is the economy. First and foremost, the EU is  ceasing to consign us to the category of countries with a "state  trade system" (that provision, incidentally, is absent from the  agreement with Ukraine). And this means that the opportunities  for using tough antidumping measures against us are limited.    Unfortunately, while accepting certain concessions in the  trade sphere, our partners remained inflexible on many other  questions. Europe is still afraid of a "Russian invasion" and  therefore our fellow citizens will still have to wait in line  for visas and, having got one and finally reached their desired  foreign land, they will have to spend a long time looking for  work. Unfortunately the European Investment Bank, which  finances major projects including those in the infrastructure,  remains closed to us. Incidentally, one of the questions at the  meeting on Corfu was the European program of "grand construction  projects." This program envisages the construction of 11  projects within the general European transportation system, such  as high-speed rail links, combined road and rail links across  the Alps, and a highway which will link northern Europe and  southern Greece. The amalgamation of the EU countries' energy  systems falls into the same category. And even though  Chancellor Kohl recently expressed in public his dream of the  time when "it will be possible to board a train in London, cross  the whole of Europe, and get out in Moscow," that dream remains  unrealizable at present. We have not been invited to take part  in those projects.    Generally speaking, even though Boris Nikolayevich spoke  eloquently on Corfu about the fact that "we are opening the door  wide to peaceful and fruitful contact between our states and  peoples," that door, albeit a wide one, has not been flung open  to us -- rather, it is merely ajar. However, that is also  understandable. After all, in its level and structure the  Russian economy will long differ from the European economy,  which means that it will be difficult for us to keep in step  with "big-league Europe." Nevertheless, that is no cause for  sorrow. Who said that Europe must mean the EU? Why not strive  for broad, pan-European cooperation while remembering to keep  our eyes on the boundless expanses of the CIS. [passage omitted]</p>

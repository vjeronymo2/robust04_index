			<p><P> July 31, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LASORDA PUSHES THE POWER OF POSITIVE THINKING;  </P> <P> BASEBALL: HE SAYS IT'S TOUGHER THAN EVER TO MANAGE IN ERA OF FREE AGENCY, BUT  DODGER SKIPPER THRIVES ON OPTIMISM.  </P> <P> The pep talk echoes loudly beyond the ears of those it is intended to motivate.  </P> <P> The deliverer is telling a story about the survivors of a sinking boat who  decide to swim to shore. They swim and swim and swim, and, nearing land, one of  them gives up.  </P> <P> "He should have just drowned when the boat sank," the speaker says. "He didn't  swim 95 yards just to quit at the last five."  </P> <P> For Los Angeles Dodgers Manager Tommy Lasorda, this is the story of the final  days of a pennant race. The players rewarded this speech with division titles  six times in Lasorda's 14 major-league seasons. In 1988, it pulled off one of  the biggest upsets in World Series history.  </P> <P> But on a July afternoon in 1990, Lasorda's arena is the Police Academy swimming  pool. His enchanted listeners are a couple of 11-year-olds. And when the  62-year-old Lasorda firmly says, "Let's go," they plunge into the water to  accompany him on another of his 70 trips down the lap lane.  </P> <P> This year, Lasorda's Dodgers have been treading water most of the season, but  their five-game winning streak has just cut Cincinnati's lead in the NL West to  seven games.  </P> <P> Although he has been optimistic throughout, Lasorda admits his job is getting  tougher.  </P> <P> "I think it's harder to manage because of the players today," he says. "They  have free agency, and they don't stick around too long. They're always looking  for better deals, and the loyalty to a team doesn't exist like it used to.  </P> <P> "I mean, when I took over this ballclub, as manager in 1977, 17 of the 25  players had played for me in the minor leagues." He said that on Sunday, there  were only two on the field who were signed by the Dodgers, pitcher Ramon  Martinez and catcher Mike Scioscia.  </P> <P> "If other pitchers are pitching and Rick Dempsey is catching, the whole team --  nine players out there -- none of them were signed by the Dodgers."  </P> <P> In other words, a guy who bleeds Dodger blue wonders where he would find a  compatible donor.  </P> <P> Not that he would need one. Since losing 40 pounds on the liquid diet he now  promotes, Lasorda appears healthier than ever. His shirt says, "Please Don't  Feed the Manager." And in his photo gallery of an office, he hands out  fattening candy bars to visitors while munching diet bars himself.  </P> <P> Doctors told him not to run on his battered knee, so he took up swimming in  March. Those 70 laps -- 7,000 feet -- last week represented a personal best.  </P> <P> "The guy's getting younger, not older," veteran Dodger Mickey Hatcher says.  "The guy comes to the park at 1:30, swims 60 laps, answers his fan mail. He's  got all the spunk in the world. If anybody should have a drug test, it's him.  He's the most unbelievable person I've ever seen in my life."  </P> <P> His players still marvel about his positive energy and his fighting spirit.  These are the foundations of his unique motivational techniques.  </P> <P> Even with a 1,150-1,005 record, Lasorda won't be remembered as one of the  greatest tactical managers of all time. One of his former players goes so far  as to describe him as "the worst tactical manager I've ever seen. I just didn't  care for what he did on the field, especially the way he handled the pitching  staff. Everybody over there had physical problems."  </P> <P> Those statements came from a pitcher, who added, "As a person, I liked him."  </P> <P> Indeed, Lasorda might be remembered as the most beloved manager in baseball.  Former A's outfielder Stan Javier, asked to compare Lasorda with Tony La Russa,  doesn't hesitate.  </P> <P> "The amazing thing about Tommy is that you see him laughing during a game,  joking," Javier said. "That's different. Tony wouldn't even smile until the  game was over."  </P> <P> It has not been an easy year for the Dodgers.  </P> <P> "No, I don't like it the way it is now, no," Lasorda said. "I think we have to  . . . I think we need Bulldog Hershiser back. I think we need Kirk Gibson  playing all season. I think we need a healthy Kal Daniels."  </P> <P> Orel Hershiser underwent surgery April 27 and is out for the season. Gibson has  been hurt for much of the last two seasons and has requested a trade. Daniels'  knees trouble him periodically.  </P> <P> Jay Howell had knee surgery, Alfredo Griffin has had an aching back, Tim  Belcher has had shoulder trouble.  </P> <P> In the face of it all, Lasorda puts on the happy mask. Every now and then, the  local scribes step out to one of Lasorda's unending string of speaking  engagements to find out what he's really thinking.  </P> <P> On the banquet circuit, they've heard:  </P> <P> "You know what I think? For the money some of these guys are getting paid, I  think they should have a clause in their contracts saying they have to pay the  club $150,000 if they don't make the All-Star team."  </P> <P> And: "Nowadays, if you fine a player $200, he says, 'Hey, Skip, let me go to my  change box and get it.' "  </P> <P> If any of this bothers Lasorda, his players don't notice it. They swallow his  spaghetti sauce by the spoonful.  </P> <P> "Since the World Series, things haven't been great," Dempsey says. "You can get  tired of losing. But Tommy is always regenerating. Every day he feels we're  just about to start a long winning streak."  </P></p>

			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / UK Company News: Templeton Emerging expands via conversion placing and offer Templeton Emerging Markets Investment Trust has expanded by Pounds 121.5m as a result of a placing and public offer of conversion shares. Up to 140m C-shares were on offer at 100p. Some Pounds 105m of the total raised came from a placing, with Pounds 16.5m coming mainly from private investors through the public offer. The fund was already the largest in the emerging markets sector, and the new money will increase its assets by about one third. Steady strong demand for shares in the fund has kept them trading fairly consistently at a premium to net asset value - currently about 5 per cent - and has enabled Templeton to make regular new issues. A scrip issue is planned later in the year to improve liquidity in the shares. The C-shares will be converted into new ordinary shares, with new warrants attached on a 1-for-5 basis, when at least 80 per cent of the new money is invested - by mid-September at the latest. Dealings in the C-shares start tomorrow. The appointment of Mr Nicholas Brady, the former US secretary to the treasury, as chairman has been confirmed.</p>

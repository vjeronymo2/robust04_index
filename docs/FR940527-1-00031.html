			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Since this issue involves a possible medical misclassification of a diagnosis, we asked our medical consultants to evaluate the condition. They determined that subcorneal pustular dermatosis is indeed a dermatological condition and not an eye condition. Based on their determination and recommendations, we propose to remove diagnosis code 694.1 from its current classification in MDC 2 and assign it to MDC 9 (Diseases and Disorders of the Skin, Subcutaneous Tissue and Breast).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to determine the appropriate DRG assignment in MDC 9, we first made a clinical evaluation of the medical DRGs. Based on the current MDC 9 configuration, the only possible DRGs appear to be DRGs 272 and 273 (Major Skin Disorders) or DRGs 283 and 284 (Minor Skin Disorders). After reviewing the average standardized charges and the types of costs assigned to DRGs 272 and 273, we believe the best assignment for 694.1 is DRGs 283 and 284. We note that the proposed FY 1995 relative weights of DRGs 46, 47, and 48 (0.7573, 0.4330, and 0.4182, respectively) are approximately equal to those of DRGs 283 and 284 (0.7142 and 0.4358, respectively). Therefore, we propose to move diagnosis code 694.1 to DRGs 283 and 284.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. MDC 15 (Newborns and Other Neonates with Conditions Originating in the Perinatal Period)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the September 1, 1993 final rule (58 FR 46283), we stated that we would be evaluating the newborn and neonate DRG classifications and relative weights for possible improvements. Because of the low volume of cases in these DRGs in the MedPAR file, we stated that we intended to rely on data bases outside the Medicare claims file to supplement our data. We expect that any major reclassification changes to MDC 15 will be based on an evaluation of actual neonate case data, including charges and clinical information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As we have not yet completed this evaluation, we will not be proposing our MDC 15 revisions for FY 1995. However, since publication of the September 1, 1993 final rule, we have received several suggestions from the public concerning improvements for the neonate DRG classifications. Some commenters suggested that we reevaluate the diagnoses that are currently considered significant problems in determining the assignment of a neonate case to DRG 390 (Neonate with Other Significant Problems) rather than DRG 391 (Normal Newborn). These commenters believe that many of the diagnoses currently assigned to DRG 390 are not truly significant clinically and in terms of resource use. These commenters also identified specific diagnoses within this group that are problematic. Even though we are not ready to proceed with a comprehensive proposal for revising MDC 15, we did ask our medical specialists to evaluate the specific conditions that were identified as problematic in the assignment of newborns to DRG 390.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Currently, cases of otherwise normal newborns with one of the following diagnoses are assigned to DRG 390 rather than DRG 391: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> 752.5_Undescended testicle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 795.4_Other nonspecific abnormal histological findings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> V05.3_Need for prophylactic vaccination against viral hepatitis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> V05.4_Need for prophylactic vaccination against Varicella  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> V20.1_Other healthy infant or child receiving care <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All of these diagnoses were identified by the commenters as nonsignificant conditions that are either not problems or require only minimal diagnostic work-up, no treatment, and result in the consumption of minimal or no additional resources. For these reasons, the commenters believe that these diagnoses should be added to the list of conditions that may be found as secondary diagnoses for DRG 391.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Specifically, a healthy newborn with undescended testicles requires only a minimal diagnostic work-up and no treatment at the time of birth. In addition, the conditions that are assigned to diagnosis code 795.4 (Other nonspecific abnormal histological findings) are nonsignificant problems and require no additional resources to treat.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commenters also pointed out that it has become standard practice to inoculate newborns against viral hepatitis, and that a prophylactic vaccination against Varicella is normal and routine and does not indicate a problem with the newborn. Diagnosis code V20.1 is generally used to identify a healthy infant that remains in the hospital for an extended period of time because of maternal illness, and should not be considered a significant problem.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All of the conditions listed above were reevaluated on a clinical basis by our medical specialists, who determined that these diagnoses are not significant problems in neonates. Therefore, we are proposing to add them to the list of secondary diagnoses that would assign an otherwise normal newborn to DRG 391.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on comments received, we also reevaluated perinatal jaundice (diagnosis codes 774.0 through 774.7) and its DRG assignments. Currently, all of these diagnosis codes except 774.6 (unspecified fetal and neonatal jaundice) are considered major problems and are assigned to DRGs 387 (Prematurity with Major Problems) and 389 (Full Term Neonate with Major Problems). Diagnosis code 774.6 is not considered a significant problem and is assigned to DRG 388 (Prematurity without Major Problems) and DRG 391. Some commenters did not believe that 774.6 should be assigned to DRG 391 when all the other perinatal jaundice codes are considered major problems. Other commenters believe that some of the perinatal jaundice diagnoses that are currently considered major are really not that resource intensive.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Our medical specialists reevaluated these perinatal jaundice conditions, and, based on their determinations, we are proposing several revisions to the neonatal DRG assignments. First, the following diagnosis codes would be removed from the major problems list in DRGs 387 and 389 and would be added to the significant problems list: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> 774.0_Perinatal jaundice from hereditary hemolytic anemias  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 774.1_Perinatal jaundice from other excessive hemolysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 774.2_Neonatal jaundice associated with preterm delivery <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

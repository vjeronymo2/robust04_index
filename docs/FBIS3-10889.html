He will invite President Itamar Franco to the  hemispheric summit that will meet in the next few months.    Gore's agenda also includes a debate with political leaders,  entrepreneurs, and environmentalists, possibly with radio and  television coverage.    It is one form of doing politics based on the tradition of  British colonizers who promoted debates with communities before  making decisions.    The Clinton administration has started doing that,  domestically. Gore wants to do it in Brasilia.    The issue will be a single one during his meeting with  Itamar  Franco, during the summit meeting or during the public debate:  the Americas' integration.    The issue has become vital to the United States' future  leadership, in the Clinton government's view.    Jeffrey Garten, former banker and Wall Street broker and  current U.S. commerce under secretary for international trade,  summarized it this way: "Our future capacity to compete, create  jobs, and remain world leaders will depend on our capacity to  succeed in the larger emerging markets."    For Washington there are three "large emerging markets" in  Latin America: Brazil, Argentina, and Mexico.    The candidates to succeed President Itamar Franco should  begin pondering this new U.S. diplomatic offensive in Latin  America that started with the signing of the free trade  agreement with Mexico.    It is crucial for any political power project in the region.  It is the main condition for any government such as the  Brazilian Government, which is betting on an "autonomous"  foreign policy based on the full dominion of the Amazon basin  (in the north) and the River Plate basin (in the south).    The "Gore mission" is an act that intends to prepare the  Latin American political arena for the application of the new  foreign relations "model" that Washington developed with Mexico  and Canada during NAFTA's negotiations.    Gore's agenda during his 48 hours in Latin America is  eloquent: Before coming to Brasilia he will travel to Buenos  Aires. In Buenos Aires he is scheduled to give a strong speech  at the World Telecommunications Conference -- the most coveted  business circle in the world.    He will speak about "reinventing governments" through a  reduction of the state role in the economy. He should not repeat  the same speech in Brazil. The State Department is afraid of  hurting the feelings of nationalists who might possibly identify  Gore's words with "an interference in domestic affairs" at a  moment Congress is trying to revise the Constitution.    In Buenos Aires, the U.S. vice president must confirm the  possibility of closing with Argentina, possibly this year, the  first protocols on free trade.    That "strategy with Argentina," as the U.S. bureaucracy  defines it, will represent progress in the direction of a common  commercial promotion project (environmental technology and spare  parts); the sale of capital goods, telecommunications equipment,  transportation, and basic sanitation with assured financing;  assistance in the financial sector's deregulation; and  "technological cooperation" in urban and environmental  engineering and biotechnology.    It is a "package" in NAFTA's direction with the White  House's  stamp on it and the parallel support of multilateral agencies  such as the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank.    Franco's successor will be installed on 1 January 1995. That  day, the borders of the Common Market of the South [Mercosur]  will open up.    Mercosur, as well as NAFTA, are already part of the scenery.  Both projects have problems, but they might represent converging  solutions.    It will depend exclusively on the capacity of rulers to use  these projects as political instruments for introducing changes  in this absurd picture of income distribution that is  threatening the future of democracy in Latin America.    The alternative is a political confrontation.</p>

			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / International Company News: Provision warning from Hafslund HAFSLUND Nycomed, Norway's second biggest listed company, yesterday reported a 40 per cent increase in half-year pre-tax profit to NKr757m (Dollars 130m), but warned of a 'relatively large' provision in the third quarter. Mr Oeyvind Broeymer, vice-president of finance, said the company had granted a NKr100m mortgage loan in connection with the 1990 disposal of Hafslund Metall, acquired by the Ila Lilleby group, a small domestic ferro silicon producer. Hafslund also maintained a put option to transfer 33 per cent of the subsidiary's shares to Ila. Mr Broeymer said there was little equity left in Ila Lilleby because of huge losses suffered in the past two years due to weak ferro silicon prices. The company might find it difficult to repay outstanding debt on the Hafslund loan and acquire the remaining shares of Hafslund Metall. Negotiations are under way with Den norske Bank and Fokus Bank, Ila's two main creditors, but a relatively large loan loss provision will most likely be made n the third quarter , Hafslund said. Apart from this development, Hafslund said prospects for 1992 as a whole were favourable. Group half-year operating profit rose by NKr133m to NKr842m as operating revenue increased 13 per cent to NKr2.907bn, including royalties of NKr289m.</p>

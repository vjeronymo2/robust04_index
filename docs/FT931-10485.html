			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / MPs ask for DTI inquiry into Lilley collapse A GROUP of Labour MPs has called for a Department of Trade and Industry inquiry into the collapse of Lilley, the Glasgow-based construction group, which went into receivership on January 7. The MPs, who include Mr Alistair Darling and Ms Joyce Quin from the party's front bench, used a parliamentary early day motion to ask for a 'full and independent' DTI inquiry and indicated they were 'increasingly concerned' at events leading up to the company's collapse. The House of Commons motion states 'adjustments were made to the accounts by writing down the value of works in progress, speculative buildings were sold into the company's pension fund when no other buyer could be found . . . the flow of funds to pay sub-contractors was held up and profitable subsidiaries were sucked dry of funds to prop up the failing property development section of the company, resulting in a deterioration of Pounds 16m in the company's (results) from a Pounds 7m published profit in 1991 to a deficit of Pounds 9m in 1992'. There has been anger in the Scottish business community at the collapse of Lilley, which had debts of more than Pounds 80m of which Pounds 20m were off-balance sheet. Many sub-contractors are among the unsecured creditors. Initially anger was directed at the failure of two banks, the Glasgow-based Clydesdale, and Hill Samuel, part of TSB Group, to back a Pounds 45m rescue package, thus pushing the company into receivership. Last week the Glasgow-based Herald newspaper attacked Sir Lewis Robertson, who had chaired Lilley since 1986, alleging that he was responsible for Lilley's mismanagement. Lilley had net assets of Pounds 47m at the end of 1991 but these had become net liabilities of Pounds 13m at the end of 1992, when it had an urgent need of Pounds 16m in cash. Price Waterhouse, the receivers, expect this week to sell the share capital of Lilley's subsidiary Robison &amp; Davidson, a Dumfries-based housebuilder and contractor, to a management buy-out. Robison &amp; Davidson was the only trading subsidiary of Lilley not in receivership. While most Lilley subsidiaries had their cash stripped out by the parent company in the months before it collapsed, Robison &amp; Davidson retained most of its cash, enabling it to stay solvent.</p>

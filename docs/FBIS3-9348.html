Lech Walesa said that Poland understands problems faced by  Ukraine. "Ukraine may become a great country but it must gain  economic independence. And we will strive for such  independence," the president said.    He confirmed his earlier statements that there is no free  Poland without free Ukraine and said that what we need now are  actions, we should look for possibilities of close, concrete  cooperation.    Also Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak received the Ukrainian  guest to discuss the most important issues in relations between  both neighbours. Both politicians agreed that their countries  are failing to use up all possibilities of cooperation at  present.    Deputy Senate Speaker Zofia Kuratowska and the Ukrainian  foreign minister agreed that geographical location of Poland and  Ukraine was of strategic significance for the security of Europe  and stressed the need for developing close economic as well as  political and cultural contacts.    Both sides examined also national minority questions in the  two countries, with Kuratowska deeming it necessary to hold a  bilateral working conference to review minority questions.    Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski and the Ukrainian guest  signed a declaration on principles of shaping Polish-Ukrainian  partnership and agreement on protection of graves and  remembrance sites.    Zlenko told reporters that the ensuring of national security  of both countries should become a strategic basis for  partnership between Poland and Ukraine.    In the Centre for Eastern Studies he spoke about current  international situation and the Ukrainian foreign policy.</p>

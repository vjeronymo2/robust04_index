			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / Mexico seeks to shape international support package Mexican government officials were yesterday in intense discussions to put together an international financial support package for an economic stabilisation plan aimed at limiting the damage from last week's peso devaluation. It would include more than Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.4bn) of credit lines beyond Dollars 7bn in standby loans previously arranged with the US and Canadian governments. With hard currency reserves that Mexican officials say stand at Dollars 6bn to Dollars 7bn, the resources available to the government could total some Dollars 25bn. The enlarged package would include likely further support from the US and Canada, a credit from other central banks arranged through the Bank for International Settlements in Basle, and standby funds from international commercial banks. However, the government has decided not to draw money from the International Monetary Fund under a standby loan programme. According to bankers, Mexico's new finance minister, Mr Guillermo Ortiz, on Thursday phoned the chairmen of Citibank, Mr John Reed, and JP Morgan, Sir Dennis Weatherstone, to ask them to arrange the credit line. Mr Reed and Citibank vice-chairman, Mr William Rhodes, were seeking support from international banks yesterday. Bankers said there was still uncertainty about the exact nature of the proposed bank credit, but a loan or standby financing of some Dollars 3bn to Dollars 6bn was being talked about. Lenders hope the scale of international backing for the new government of President Ernesto Zedillo would so boost investor confidence that the credits would not need to be used. Mr Zedillo is due on Monday to detail the government's stabilisation plan, which is still under discussion. The government, among other things, is considering basing its new budget on a peso exchange rate of 4.5 to the dollar, though it hopes the peso will be stronger. An inflation target of 15 per cent for 1995 is being discussed. The aim is to cut the current account deficit from close to Dollars 30bn this year, to Dollars 14bn or less in 1995. Government economists have downgraded their growth forecast to around 1.5 per cent next year from 4.5 per cent this. Leaders of government, business and labour were yesterday seeking an accord to hold down wages and prices. The labour secretary Mr Santiago Onate said wages would rise by no more than 7 per cent next year, but the unions are demanding more. Officials expect an agreement to be announced on Monday. The peso closed yesterday at 5.075 to the dollar, slightly down from Wednesday's close. The Mexican stock market closed down 1.47 per cent.

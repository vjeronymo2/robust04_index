			<p><P> August 28, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> STEFFI GRAF, MATS WILANDER POLISH OFF FIRST OPPONENTS  </P> <P> Defending singles champions Steffi Graf and Mats Wilander made short work of  their opening-round opponents today to launch the 1989 U.S. Open tennis  championships.  </P> <P> Graf, the world's No. 1 and winner of six of the last seven grand slam events,  overwhelmed Etsuko Inoue of Japan 6-3, 6-1 in the tournament's opening match at  the Louis Armstrong Stadium's center court.  </P> <P> "I am not totally happy with how I played," the 20-year-old West German said  after her 56-minute victory. "In the first set I was rushing too much. I wasn't  being patient enough to wait for the right shot."  </P> <P> Wilander, men's defending champion, mired in a slump all year, shrugged off  what could have been a tough challenge with a confident 6-1, 6-3, 6-1 victory  over Austrian Horst Skoff, ranked 29th in the world.  </P> <P> Graf's victory under overcast skies opened what promised to be a busy day at  the noisy National Tennis Center with 64 opening-round matches scheduled.  </P> <P> Other stars due to take to the courts included four-time champion John McEnroe  and Wimbledon champion Boris Becker.  </P> <P> Graf's compatriot, Claudia Kohde-Kilsch, fell 6-4, 6-0 to Nathalie Herreman of  France.  </P> <P> Natalia Zvereva of the Soviet Union escaped the dubious distinction of being  the first seed to fall when she pulled out a 1-6, 6-4, 7-6 win over Pascale  Paradis of France.  </P> <P> Other women winners included Americans Camille Benjamin and Ann Grossman and  France's Nathalie Tauziat.  </P> <P> Benjamin beat Brazilian Andrea Vieira 6-2, 6-2, and Grossman eliminated Dinky  van Rensberg of South Africa 6-4, 6-1.  </P> <P> Tauziat defeated American Andrea Farley 6-1, 6-3.  </P></p>

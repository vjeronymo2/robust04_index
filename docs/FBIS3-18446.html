It  is by coming here that you understand." [French Senate Chairman]  Rene Monory thinks that the French -- particularly their  politicians -- are not sufficiently aware of what is happening  in China and in the "little dragons." "The French political  world is introspective," he remarked in the plane taking us to  China. "You have to travel to gauge things. Politicians do not  travel."    Gauging things... It is true that present-day China in  ferment, where the Senate speaker has just spent a week,  provides unsuspected prospects for the French who are facing  economic stagnation -- or minimum expansion. China, whose GNP  increased by 13 percent last year, has experienced a prodigious  explosion in economic activity over the past 15 years,  particularly in the "special economic areas." And this  explosion is reflected on the ground in a prodigious growth in  factories and skyscrapers.    The Senate speaker, China's official guest, was primarily  tasked with a diplomatic mission: To contribute to the  improvement in relations between France and China. And through  that to work to ensure that the visit which Edouard Balladur  makes to this country in early April takes place in the best  possible conditions.    The conversations which Mr. Monory has had with his Chinese  hosts suggest that the situation is being clarified, and that  the prime minister's visit will be profitable. The Senate  speaker was received in Beijing not only by Qiao Shi, speaker of  the National People's Congress, but also by Premier Li Peng who  gave a dinner in his honor, by Vice President Rong Yiren, and by  the deputy foreign trade minister and the chairman of the  equivalent of the CNPF [National Council of French Employers].  In a country where signs and symbols are extremely important  and where custom dictates that a speaker of a foreign assembly  is only received by his counterpart, this hospitality stands out.  <H5>  Heady Pace of Expansion </H5>   Li Peng said: "We hope that Mr. Balladur's visit will be a  complete success," and Vice President Rong Yiren judged this  forthcoming visit as "very important" for the development of  relations between the two countries. "We are in favor of  constantly promoting relations between the two countries," the  Chinese vice president told the Senate speaker. "I hope that  the period of uncertainty will be forgotten, and that we will  return to the atmosphere of friendship which has reigned between  us for 30 years," Mr. Monory replied.    Franco-Chinese relations had a close shave: The case of the  contract for the sale of Mirage planes to Taiwan is only slowly  being accepted. Not one of the leaders with whom the Senate  speaker met failed to stress the "problems" and "vicissitudes"  which these relations have experienced over recent years. The  Canton consulate general, opened in 1991, had to be closed the  following year at the request of the Chinese, and the RATP  [Independent Paris Transport System] lost the Canton subway deal.    However, the Chinese leaders wanted nothing more than to  respond to the French desire to reopen dialogue, if only to  diversify their partners, which, moreover, they like to see in  competition with each other, and to benefit from our know-how.  The rapprochement brought about at Mr. Balladur's initiative  resulted in the communique jointly issued on 12 January in which  France pledged in particular not to sell any more arms to  Taiwan. It is in this atmosphere that the Senate speaker's  visit was made, a few weeks after that of Alain Peyrefitte who  was also tasked with strengthening ties. Mr. Monory had been  invited a year ago by the National People's Congress. The visit  had been postponed several times at the premier's request. To  prevent the Senate speaker from being rebuffed and to ensure  that his visit effectively formed part of the reconciliation  started, the publication of the joint communique had to be  awaited.    Mr. Monory vaunted the excellence of French technology in a  number of spheres to the Chinese officials: transportation, the  nuclear industry, aeronautics, and so forth. "We have the best  high-speed train in the world," he said, for instance, to Qiao  Chi between the sizzling beef and the soft turtle stew.  According to him, the only way in which our country can return  to growth is to find outlets for its industries in this region  of the world in which a good part of the world's economic growth  is concentrated. French enterprises -- for instance Mr. Monory  visited the Peugeot factory -- are participating in Chinese  development by joint ventures, which are often very effective  but of which we have far fewer than the Germans.    The stages of his visit merely confirmed this idea in him.  Shanghai, an urban jumble all blended together, in which slums  doomed to disappear mingle with houses bearing the nostalgic  charm of the former concessions, and brand new skyscrapers, and  in which the municipality has undertaken to build in 10 years an  area similar to but bigger than the Paris Defense area in the  new Pudong district. Canton, then Shenzen, a city of 3 million  inhabitants which has emerged from nowhere in about 10 years.  Finally Hong Kong, a replica of Manhattan, which has no reason  to envy its model, which is destined to rejoin China in three  years' time while maintaining its economic status. The Senate  speaker is a little more enthusiastic than the Chinese  themselves about their future: "How long do you think you will  need to catch up with us? Will it take 15 years, 20 years?" he  asked Qiao Shi. "A century," the chairman of the People's  Congress replied. But for a Chinese that is a relatively short  prospect given the scale of China's history.</p>

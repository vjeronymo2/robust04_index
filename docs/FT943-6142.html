			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Cathay Intl ahead to Pounds 469,000 Cathay International Holdings, the London quoted investment company formerly known as Stonehill, yesterday announced that net assets had risen from Pounds 62.9m to Pounds 233.2m, following a series of investments in China made last year. Pre-tax profits for the year to March amounted to Pounds 469,000 (Pounds 264,000), however, the company received no meaningful contribution from either of two substantial new assets, the Landmark Hotel in Shenzhen and the Xiyuan Hotel in Beijing. Last year, the company was transformed from a shell, containing the Stonehill business park, into the holding company for those two hotels and a related property development project. Turnover during the year rose from Pounds 4.03m to Pounds 5.94m, and operating profit amounted to Pounds 1.28m (Pounds 1.86m). Losses per share emerged at 0.09p (0.066p). There is no dividend. The company has eliminated the deficit on its profit and loss account, but still owes Pounds 336,000 of preference share dividends. It has given no timescale for reviving dividends.</p>

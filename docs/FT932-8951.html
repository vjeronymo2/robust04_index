			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Arts: YMSO tackles social themes IT IS a double achievement to come up with a programme which is not only musically ambitious, but also politically correct. For its Royal Festival Hall concert on Wednesday - a splendid achievement all round - the Young Musicians Symphony Orchestra brought together two works which tackle major social themes of our century. The First Symphony of John Corigliano is the more recent, the more urgent in what it has to say. First performed in 1990, this is the composer's symphonic tribute to friends who had died from AIDS. It is impossible to escape the issue that the music confronts, for the theme is no convenient tag attached at a late stage; it dominates the argument from the first note to the last. The message and the music cannot be divorced. In these circumstances a cool-headed evaluation of the symphony's musical virtues is not easy (one might even say not desirable.) Corigliano's style is overtly sensation-seeking. The thumping heartbeat on the timpani, the 'brutal scream' of death from madness, the unashamed sentimentality as fragments of favourite music from better times are heard in the distance - all these are obvious effects, which are probably half expected even before the symphony begins. What still makes the listener gasp is their impact. In his desire to blast the audience out of complacency, Corigliano has not stinted on the size of the orchestra. The YMSO had players spilling into the choir seats (it seemsunlikely that a professional orchestra here could afford to put the symphony on). Under James Blair the young musicians played with enormous intensity and the rage, the passion, the sadness of the music were white-hot. In the 1930s other world problems occupied the thinking composer's mind. Tippett's oratorio A Child of Our Time ostensibly deals with the hounding of a Jewish mother and son, but the use of spirituals at the point where Bach would have had chorales points to wider sympathies ('in the continual persecution one race stood for all'). The YMSO performance was not on the level of the Corigliano for unbuttoned, spontaneous involvement, but it was as involving as many a professional encounter with this score. Blair obtained acute, sharp playing from his musicians. The Crouch End Festival Chorus was well rehearsed and there was a fine young quartet of soloists, especially Stephen Gadd, the firm and eloquent bass.</p>

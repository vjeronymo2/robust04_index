			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading REPORTS of a Gallup opinion poll indicating a Labour party lead in the general election led to a weak closing in stock index futures, although turnover was again high following a volatile session, writes Joel Kibazo. The June contract on the FT-SE started the session strongly, up 11 at 2,455, after Wednesday's opinion polls once again pointed to the prospect of a hung parliament. But dealers said there was no follow-through buying after the initial spurt and June was 'sold off aggressively', falling to 2,425 by mid-morning. A rally was seen in the contract during the afternoon session following a firm Wall Street start, but talk about the latest opinion poll triggered selling by independent traders, sending June south once again to a weak close. June ended at 2,427, down 19 from the previous session and around 6 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 28. Turnover at 6,352 lots was again healthy. In traded options, volume reached 33,297 contracts by the close. The FT-SE option once again took centre stage, trading a day's total of 15,012. The Euro FT-SE had 2,096 lots dealt. Activity in stock options was again poor, although better than on Wednesday.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The statute does not limit termination action to hospitals that have a pattern of violations. A single violation may result in the initiation of termination procedures. However, HCFA is more interested in hospitals correcting their deficiencies and remaining available to serve patients than in terminating them from Medicare participation. As a result, HCFA regional office staff have generally exercised their authority to permit correction before the effective date of termination as justification for rescinding the termination. On the other hand, hospitals that do not correct the deficiencies that permitted a violation to occur may represent an immediate and serious threat to people seeking emergency care. In such a case, HCFA will move quickly to either assure that the deficiencies that led to the violation are corrected or to terminate the hospital's provider agreement. It should be noted that section 4008(b)(3) of OBRA 90 deleted the termination and suspension language from section 1867(d) of the Act. Terminations due to violations of section 1867 of the Act are now subject to the regular provider agreement rules in section 1866 of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We believe that the immediate and serious threat concept applies to a provider's potential for causing harm as a result of lax policies and procedures as well as the danger posed by patently unsafe physical conditions or staffing shortages. Thus, we believe that operating in a manner that potentially subjects individuals to the threat of summary transfer without treatment may pose an immediate and serious threat to individuals who present themselves to the hospital for treatment. As noted above, if the provider is able to demonstrate that this is not the case, the termination is withdrawn and the provider's participation in the program is uninterrupted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Hence, while a single violation may very well be sanctioned with civil monetary penalties, nothing in the statutory scheme suggests that the authority to terminate a hospital's provider agreement should be limited by the number of violations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter objected to the application of ``fraud and abuse'' concepts to quality of care issues; for example, degree of culpability of the hospital or responsible physician.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The factors to be considered in determining the amount of civil monetary penalty that are set forth in &sect;1003.106(a)(4) are adapted from those mandated by section 1128A(d) of the Act. Section 1867(d)(1) of the Act requires that the provisions of section 1128A of the Act other than subsection (a) and subsection (b) apply to the imposition of a civil monetary penalty against a participating hospital and physician.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As thus incorporated by reference, section 1128A(d) of the Act requires that the OIG consider the nature of claims and circumstances under which they were presented, the degree of culpability, history of prior offenses, and financial condition of the person presenting the claims, and such other matters as justice may require.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We are revising proposed &sect;1003.106(a)(4) to reflect the essence of these statutory considerations as modified to fit violations of section 1867 of the Act. Section 1003.106(a)(4) also now includes among the factors ``financial condition'' and ``nature and circumstances of the violation.'' These were omitted from the notice of proposed rulemaking but are required under section 1128A(d) of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter stated that, before termination, HCFA should consider all circumstances of the case including such mitigating factors as: the previous sanction record of the hospital; the hospital's willingness and ability to comply with its obligations to emergency room patients; prior history of transfer; and the impact the termination may have on the community.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Congress has provided that any hospital that has failed to comply with the requirements of section 1867 of the Act is subject to termination of its provider agreement. It did not provide, or suggest in legislative history, that the Secretary should create a system of lesser measures to account for the factors mentioned by the commenter. Rather, it intended the gravity of the sanction to cause hospitals to comply with their obligations. When a hospital does violate its duties under section 1867 of the Act, we must take immediate action to prevent that hospital from jeopardizing the health and safety of the next person who may seek help in an emergency situation. Vigorous enforcement of these provisions is essential to remedy the problem that prompted Congress to legislate against the denial of screening and/or treatment and the inappropriate transfer of individuals with emergency medical conditions. A hospital will not suffer the loss of Medicare funding if it can demonstrate to HCFA's satisfaction that it has taken the steps necessary to ensure that the mandates of the statute are observed by its employees, contractors, and staff. If a hospital demonstrates its unwillingness or inability to meet that commitment within the time provided, it will be terminated. When a hospital has had a history of violations, the situation may make the regional office skeptical about the hospital's willingness and ability to enforce its own policies to guarantee that emergency services are available to all.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We recognize that the termination of a hospital's provider agreement would have a serious impact on the community. This is the remedy the law provides. We believe that this remedy provides the hospital (and its community) with the incentive to assure compliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

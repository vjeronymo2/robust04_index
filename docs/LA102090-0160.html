The  teachers are asking for more time for class preparation, and the district wants  to clarify the policy on teachers and other certificated personnel transferring  within the district.  </P> <P> The teachers, in the final year of a three-year contract, have picketed the  past three meetings of the board of education.  </P> <P> The next scheduled negotiating session is Nov. 17 and 18.

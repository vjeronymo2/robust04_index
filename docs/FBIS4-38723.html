			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by State Duma deputy Boris Fedorov: "New Phase of </F> Reforms?"]    [Text] Just over four months after the "pause" in the  reforms the president has had to grasp the initiative and issue  a number of edicts.    Why it is necessary to talk of a "pause" can be judged by  the  fact that, in March-April alone, the government issued around  500 decrees and directives, of which not one had any direct  bearing on economic policy.    The edicts on the abolition of export quotas and licenses,  on  the inclusion of the federal road fund in the budget, and on the  operation of virtually all sector funds through the budget can  be called unquestionably reformist. True, all this was  suggested a year ago, but then the resistance of sector  lobbyists could not be overcome. With the inclusion of the  majority of funds in the budget the field for corruption is  considerably reduced.    It is indeed essential, as is envisaged in the edicts, to  reduce profits tax and value-added tax by 10-20 percent, but the  increase in taxes on individuals and property does not elicit  enthusiasm. We have still not restored living standards even to  1990's indicators, and that means that the time to increase  citizens' taxes has not yet come. On the contrary, the middle  class must be help to get on its feet. It is my conviction that  proposals which are being floated to tax interest on savings and  to tighten up the regulation of enterprise consumer funds should  by no means be supported.    The president's desire to reduce the number of tax and  customs privileges is undoubtedly correct, although at the same  time it would not be a bad idea to determine who granted them  and why. Export duties should have been abolished long ago. But  the attempt to help unprofitable agriculture by reducing  value-added tax to 10 percent is unlikely to bring tangible  results. It is far more important economically to force  agrarians to battle to cut costs resulting from losses.    In talking of the merits of the signed edicts, it is  impossible, on the other hand, to overlook their careless  professional and juridical elaboration. With a "live"  parliament it is an extremely risky business to adopt decisions  which come under its jurisdiction. Therefore the question as to  whether standard contributions to the social security fund will  be reduced from 1 June or whether tax privileges will be given  to enterprises with foreign investors remains open.    In principle, the aforementioned decisions deserve support,  but their legality is open to doubt.    The decision on the wholesale introduction of the compulsory  universal certification of the opening of accounts, with  numerous penalties for deviations from the new rules, cannot be  deemed market-oriented and reformist. The authors have  evidently forgotten that any enterprise has a balance sheet and  accounts books. If any funds do not pass through these records,  this is a deception of shareholders and clients. Certification  of the opening of accounts will be of very little use in filling  the state coffers if people are determined not to pay taxes.    The introduction of more stringent penalities for violation  of tax legislation and the rules for handling cash receipts is  undoubtedly timely. But will yet another administrative  offensive on cash transactions help here? The impression arises  that, instead of improving the payments system, which itself  makes cash transactions simply unprofitable (only purely  criminal cash transactions now take place), some people are  reviving the old Soviet ideas of separating cash and noncash  turnover.    I was surprised by the introduction by presidential edict of  yet another new procedure for enterprises and organizations to  use the money in their accounts. It seems that the document's  authors are thinking only of loss-making state enterprises and  have forgotten that there are thousands of private firms in  Russia who are increasingly annoyed by the expanding  bureaucratic state protection.    The introduction of transferable securities as a means of  reorganizing the debts of enterprises, which was blocked after  the president's edict of 19 October 1993, should have been  expanded long ago. On the whole the innovations in the payments  sphere violate the principle of the Central Bank's independence.  In my view, this is unlawful and can lead to no good.    No noble purposes can justify the violation of laws,  especially if this violation comes from the top. In my view,  should it turn out that parliament is for any reason incapable  of carrying out normal legislative activity, new elections  should be held and the electoral law should be changed; but the  Duma should not be turned into a talking shop for deputies.    The general impression given by this series of edicts is:  several correct measures, several administrative exaggerations,  and a few doubts over the legality of some of the decisions. At  any rate, it is better than nothing.</p>

			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / The ERM Crisis: Madrid 'needs anchor of EMS' - Fears in Spain MR Pedro Solbes, Spain's economy and finance minister, yesterday called for weekend inter-governmental talks to stem further currency speculation. 'We cannot start off on Monday in the same way that we finished off on Friday,' Mr Solbes said. He said the talks should be sponsored by France and Germany. Mr Solbes was speaking after a cabinet meeting which had reviewed cuts in unemployment benefits to reduce Spain's expanding budget deficit. The discussions took place as Spain began facing up to possible withdrawal of the peseta from the ERM. Domestic policy makers, business leaders and economists are uncertain about what life might be like outside the security of the ERM. There are fears that Spain, after four years of EMS membership, still requires the discipline imposed by the system. 'Within the EMS we have an anchor that propels us towards convergence (with the system's stronger economies) and protects us from the financial indiscipline that would otherwise exist,' said Mr Oscar Fanjul, chairman of the state energy group, Repsol. However, some economists argue that Spain has already cut loose from the disciplinary anchor. The public deficit is running at around at 6 per cent of GDP, double what it ought to be under convergence targets, and inflation has stuck at an unacceptably high 4 to 6 per cent. Carlos Espinosa de los Monteros, chairman of the Circulo de Empresarios, a Madrid-based business think-tank, argued it did not make that much difference whether Spain remained in the ERM or not. 'Everything would be fine if we had been disciplined but we haven't. We have the disadvantages of ERM contraints and not the advantages of fiscal probity.' The economy desperately needs lower interest rates with GDP set to fall by perhaps 0.5 per cent in 1993 and first half statistics showing unemployment at 22.25 per cent. But Mr Gwynn Hatch, a senior economist at James Capel in London, argued that the Bank of Spain could only reduce rates cautiously. 'The difference between Spain and the UK last autumn and with France now is that Spain has not got inflation licked.'</p>

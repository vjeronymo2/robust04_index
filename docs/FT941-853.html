			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / World Bond Markets: Tokyo While trading for March settlement has ended for the bond market, most investors are expected to remain cautious in committing funds as the spate of economic data announced this week is expected to reconfirm the bottoming of the economy. Industrial production data, scheduled to be released on Wednesday, are expected to show a month-on-month rise for the second consecutive month. BZW in Tokyo expects demand from sectors including electric machinery and non-ferrous metals to support February industrial output. It predicts production figures to rise 2 per cent from the previous month, which translates into a 2.6 per cent fall from the same month last year, the smallest decline since March last year. Household expenditure for January is also forecast to show firm month-on-month and year-on-year rises, due to increased spending on furniture and household goods and a rise in medical care and transport spending. The figures come as government bonds face volatility for technical reasons. Trading of the No 164 10-year bond has risen on expectations that it will replace the No 157, the benchmark since November. Market participants expect an announcement of the next 10-year bond auction this week, which may prompt a sell-off in the No 157 and signal a benchmark change.</p>

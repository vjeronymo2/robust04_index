			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / Investors make waves over a sea of money: Kenneth Gooding looks at growing impatience with Minorco, which is sitting on a Dollars 1.9bn cash hoard THE INVESTMENT community is beginning to lose patience with Minorco. Eighteen months ago, the Luxembourg-quoted investment arm of the South African mining house, Anglo American, promised to transform itself into a world-class natural resources group using its Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.47bn) war chest. Today the cash pile still amounts to Dollars 1.9bn. Criticisms are being aimed at the group's apparent hesitancy to put its cash to work, particularly its failure to pick up cheap companies last year when share prices were depressed. The let-down is more acute because of the excitement generated by Minorco's unsuccessful hostile bid for Consolidated Gold Fields of the UK. Much of Minorco's cash came from the sale of its stake in the target company to the Hanson conglomerate in September, 1989. Mr Rob Davies, analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers, reflects a widespread view when he says: 'We continue to have doubts about the ability of the management to make acquisitions and to run operations successfully.' Minorco's institutional investors are mainly in South Africa. Most UK institutions are not interested. They have been put off by Minorco's South African parentage and Luxembourg quote, in addition to the management's performance. One UK fund manager typified the prevailing lethargy when he said: 'I think we still hold a few Minorco shares for tax reasons. But it wouldn't trouble me if we didn't have them.' Mr Tony Lea, one of the three 'young Turks' who, with Sir Michael Edwardes, led the disastrous attack on Gold Fields, agrees that 'the jury must be out until we are fully invested and people can see what this company has become'. But Mr Lea, now joint managing director, suggests that Minorco is 'motoring along' towards its objective. Its most spectacular move so far was to buy Freeport McMoRan Gold in March last year for Dollars 705m. The cost, representing 50 times historic earnings, always looked high and a falling gold price since has not improved the perception. Low prices and some technical problems saw the gold company, renamed Independence Mining, do little better than break even in the half-year to December 30. Some analysts suggest that Minorco paid a substantial premium partly because it wanted to prove that the US was not 'off-limits'. The Gold Fields bid foundered because of decisions by a New York judge. Consequently, it was widely assumed that Minorco would face a court battle about its South African parentage any time it attempted to buy in the US. If Minorco had taken over Gold Fields, it intended to keep the North American gold interests and the UK group's ARC aggregates operations. In March Minorco broke into the aggregates market by agreeing to buy for DM178m (Pounds 59.9m) Elbekies Muhlberg in what used to be east Germany, together with the rights to 230m tonnes of sand and gravel on the River Elbe. Again, the price looks high. But Mr Roger Phillimore, Minorco's other joint managing director, points out that research convinced the group that 'you can make a lot of money from aggregates if you get the costs right'. Minorco aims to be a big player in Europe 'so that we can play in a bigger game - in joint ventures with other major companies, for example . . . East Germany gave us the opportunity to get big very quickly - but with some risk. It is a super asset, but we might have a rough time for a while waiting for demand to come right.' Another recent deal did not exactly fit the main strategic thrust. Minorco paid Dollars 30m for 81 per cent of the loss-making Beralt Tin &amp; Wolfram in Portugal, which operates Europe's only wolfram mine. This move was widely seen as Anglo American reshuffling assets because the seller was Charter Consolidated, a 36 per cent-owned associate of Minorco. But Mr Phillimore insists the deal had strategic implications. It gives Minorco a foothold on the Iberian Peninsula, which promises to become a highly active mining region. Minorco also intends to acquire a world-class base metals business. The group already has a stake in base metals through its 56 per cent-owned subsidiary, Inspiration Resources, which owns Hudson Bay Mining and Smelting in Canada. Inspiration Resources is being reorganised by selling or closing down all non-core assets, leaving just the Terra agricultural business in the US and the Hudson Bay (Hudbay) group. Analysts suggest this leaves the way clear for Terra to be sold and for Minorco to take control of Hudbay. This company must invest CDollars 185m (USDollars 160.8m) , including CDollars 50m on its smelter, to meet stringent Canadian anti-pollution measures due to be introduced in 1994. Inspiration would be hard pressed to finance the Hudbay project but Minorco could afford it. 'We are paying a great deal of attention to Hudbay. There is a big challenge there,' says Mr Lea. 'But Hudbay is not world class, by any stretch of the imagination. And we want a world-class base metals business.' Changes at Inspiration Resources illustrate Minorco's approach to its investments. Mr Phillimore says Minorco still intends either to take control of assets or sell them off - 'but in our own time'. 'While we are waiting, we have been encouraging those assets to perform better and become more valuable. We have encouraged them to focus on the businesses they do best.' Apart from Inspiration and Charter Consolidated, the quoted investments also include Adobe Resources, a US oil and gas producer (49 per cent owned) and Engelhard Corporation, a US speciality chemicals and precious metals group (30 per cent). Full control of Charter, however, would probably be politically impossible unless Minorco sheds its Engelhard stake. Charter owns 38 per cent of Johnson Matthey, the world's biggest platinum marketing group and Engelhard's main competitor. US anti-trust legislators would not countenance both these important platinum marketeers being under the direct influence of Minorco and, thus, Anglo American, which is a big platinum producer. Meanwhile, interest on Minorco's cash hoard is providing about 80 per cent of its net earnings which totalled Dollars 58m in the first half of the current financial year and Dollars 784.4m in the previous 12 months. The share price has languished at a discount to net asset value of between 20 and 30 per cent. Why not simply give the money back to the shareholders? Mr Phillimore laughs and says: 'That would require a degree of humility we don't have.'</p>

			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / Global Forum faces Pounds 1m shortfall Only eight weeks before 600 delegates from all over the world arrive in Manchester for the Global Forum '94 environmental conference, organisers are still nearly Pounds 1m short of being certain of financing the Pounds 3.6m event. The EU has agreed to give Pounds 1.6m, although a contract has still to be completed, while Manchester City Council and Manchester Airport have guaranteed Pounds 500,000 each. Siemens, British Telecommunications and Co-operative Bank are corporate sponsors and more are being sought. Sir Gil Thompson, chairman of the event and president of the airport, said yesterday the government was 'still thinking about it' after a presentation to Mr John Gummer, environment secretary. The forum will follow up the event which ran parallel to the Earth Summit in Rio in 1992. The summit itself was followed by an inter-governmental conference called Partnerships for Change in Manchester last September. The forum was to be staged then but was postponed because of organisational and funding difficulties. Mr John Major committed the UK to both events when he attended the Rio summit, but only the inter-governmental conference was guaranteed public funds. However, Mr Major may not be able to attend the forum as it will overlap the next EU summit in Greece. The forum itself has been slimmed to a core conference on the sustainable development of cities. It will report to the United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development, which monitors progress on environmental improvements agreed in Rio. The report will then go to next year's Habitat 2 conference in Istanbul, organised by the UN Commission on Human Settlement.</p>

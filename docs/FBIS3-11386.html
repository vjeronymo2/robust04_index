			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" article by Jose Dos Santos, PRENSA LATINA </F> collaborator and vice president of the Union of Cuban  Journalists]    [Text] Havana [no dateline as received] -- The U.S.  Government's policy of constant aggression and hostility has  been the object of an extensive analysis by the Cuban parliament  in an effort to unveil the reasons behind the unique situation  experienced by the Cuban nation, which Washington is denying the  right to determine its own fate.    A detailed document by the Permanent International Relations  Commission of the National Assembly of the People's Government  handed to this reporter explains key aspects of this  aggressiveness, which endangers our national peace and security.    The document states, among other things, Cuba is living  today  under a partial military blockade despite statements by  high-ranking U.S. political leaders who have ruled out the  possibility of a military intervention on the island.    In this regard, it notes the decision to recondition the Air  Force Base in Homestead, Florida, which was destroyed by  Hurricane Andrew in 1992 and which was scheduled to be shut down  in early 1993. The reconditioning of this installation adds to  the increase in the number of planes and activity at the Key  West Air and Naval Station, located only 90 miles from the Cuban  coasts, and to the deployment of some 60 warships off Cuba's  eastern coast under the pretense of the Haitian crisis.    U.S. warplanes flew a little more than 64,000 missions over  the Florida strait during the last three years. During the  first half of 1993 more than 5,600 missions were flown, some  only 60 km away from Cuban territory.    The Cuban parliament has reported U.S. military forces are  constantly conducting surveillance operations of all kinds all  over Cuba. It is a growing trend as can be seen during the  first 10 months of 1993, when 88 flights of this kind had  already taken place versus the 45 flights that took place in  1991.    Likewise, the maintenance of Guantanamo Naval Base is part  of  the political pressure against Cuba. More than 220 violations  and provocations against Cuban guards occurred between 1990 and  1993 from that enclave. In addition during the first half of  1993 alone a total of 168 ships of different types visited the  base, where six military exercises of various characteristics  were conducted.    To this dangerous military buildup we may add during this  same period the intentions of terrorists groups based in the  United States to attack Cuba. The leaders of some of these  groups have been arrested, but no judicial ruling regarding  these groups has been issued.  <H5>  Other Aggressions </H5>   Less visible but still persistent tensions regarding Cuba  may  be found on the airwaves. Cuba is bombarded by 15 radio  stations with more than 200 hours a day of anti-Cuban  programming aimed "at spreading fear and uncertainty, fanaticism  and insanity, and promoting unscrupulous and unethical  behaviors."    U.S. federal agencies allocated in the last few years more  than $150 million for the promotion of these broadcasts, many of  which violate international conventions, misrepresent the truth,  and conduct other actions aimed at promoting everything from  subversion and disillusion to desertions every day.    This field, called "migratory aggression," has been turned  into a "subversive political component" by U.S. presidents to  encourage the departure of illegal aliens, to create internal  difficulties in Cuba, and to "encourage an international  campaign that can distort and hurt Cuba's image abroad."    If Cubans constitute only .25 percent of the legal  immigrants  who arrived in U.S. territory during the last fiscal year and  2.04 percent of the illegal refugees, why is Cuban immigration  such a disproportionate issue with such enormous propaganda?    The use of this issue as a weapon to attempt to discredit  Cuba has been a constant element in the past three decades.  Even though Cuban authorities have allowed the freedom to  emigrate in the past few years, the obstacles, the whimsical  selective nature of the permits given, and the clear  discriminatory policy toward what Washington accepts as eligible  all preclude the normalization of the migratory movement.    Meanwhile, the outlook for the area is critical, and in this  regard the document mentions the existence of hundreds of  thousands of illegal Mexican aliens who are virtually suffering  conditions of slavery in the United States, not to mention the  thousands who are captured and deported as they attempt to enter  clandestinely into the country.    In view of this outlook, the Cuban legislators believe their  country has done everything possible to find a sensible and  civilized solution to the confrontation with the U.S.  Government, which is not limited to the economic, trade, and  financial blockade against the island for the past three decades.    That is why they believe the solution to the conflict does  not lie in permanently asking Cuba to make changes to its social  organization, rather, to "promote external conditions so the  aspirations to improve the social model freely chosen by the  Cuban people can effectively take place."    To achieve this the Cuban legislators say "the United States  is the one that needs to be pressured by demanding a change to  its obsolete and irrational policy toward Cuba."</p>

			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / 100 Years In The Pink: Police hot on the heels of Jabez Balfour SCOTLAND YARD detectives this week extended their search for Jabez Spencer Balfour, the disgraced financier who disappeared on December 18 following the arrest of two of his associates. Sources in the Square Mile suggest that he may have fled to South America. The downfall of Balfour and his business enterprises must rank as one of the great financial scandals of the nineteenth century. The Liberator Building Society, which collapsed in the autumn, was easily the biggest such society in Britain. Preliminary indications suggest the total loss to shareholders and depositors of the Liberator and seven associated companies may exceed the extraordinary sum of Pounds 8m. What makes the news all the more shocking is that Mr Balfour has long been regarded as a pillar of the business establishment. Only last summer, he was re-elected as Liberal member of parliament for Burnley. He has served on the board of many sound City companies, and has been associated with the construction of such magnificent London landmarks as Whitehall Court, the Hyde Park Hotel, the Liberal Club and the Hotel Cecil. He is regarded as a benefactor by the tenants of his Oxfordshire estate. Moreover, he is a man who has made much of non-conformist and Temperance Society connections. The early success of the Liberator under his leadership owed much to these associations. The society advertised that loans were available not only for homes but also for the building of chapels. Mr Balfour established a large agency organisation among ministers and laymen, who in return for a small commission encouraged their flock to deposit savings with the Liberator. The broad outlines of the disaster are clear. Founded in 1868, the Liberator's early years were distinguished by rapid growth, but the society appears to have first operated along conventional lines. In the past decade or so, however, its character seems to have changed markedly. Over that period, Mr Balfour established or acquired a number of construction, property development and surveying businesses - in effect, an integrated property investment group, for which the Liberator became the main source of finance. At the time of its collapse, nearly all the society's assets had been advanced to Mr Balfour's companies, on what turns out to have been very questionable security. A favourite device appears to have been for Mr Balfour to obtain an option on an estate, and then sell it on at an inflated price to one of the four connected property companies with the full purchase money being borrowed from the Liberator. He would then pocket the profit. An obvious question is why such enterprises were not checked by Mr Balfour's respectable colleagues. Part of the answer lies in his forceful personality. His style is described as 'very aggressive; it was all done at red hot speed and he talked all the time.' What this meant in practice is shown in a board resolution at one of his companies which gave him unlimited powers to invest in any company he thought fit. Had the directors not allowed themselves to be bemused by the overwhelming magnetism, optimism and energy of their leader - who took no more than four hours sleep a night - the outcome might have been very different. Three public policy issues follow from this affair. First, urgent steps must be taken to provide compensation for the thousands of depositors who now face a bleak new year. Second, legislation is required to establish a sound framework for the nation's building societies. Third, and perhaps most important, serious consideration must be given to the governance of important business enterprises. Never again must a single dominating individual have the power to shift the savings of ordinary citizens into his private business activities, thereby causing ruin and despair. Balfour was extradited from Argentina in 1895 and sentenced to a total of 14 years imprisonment. He was a model prisoner at Parkhurst, where he served both as librarian and organist, and was released with full remission for good conduct in 1906. He died in 1916. The Liberator collapse led to the Building Societies Act of 1894. A relief fund was established which helped more than 3,000 depositors over the following two decades. The problem of corporate governance remains unresolved.</p>

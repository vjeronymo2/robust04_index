			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 16 Jun (MTI) -- The National Election  Committee (NEC) has declared the official final results of the  first and second rounds of the general elections, after the  Supreme Court approved its decision on modifying the results in  the sixth constituency -- Gyor-Moson-Sopron County (W Hungary)  -- where Gyorgy Rasko (HDF) finished in first place after the  re-count, instead of Gyula Varga (AFD). Thus, the Hungarian  Democratic Forum receives one more seat (bringing the total to  38) in Hungary's 386-seat National Assembly, while the Alliance  of Free Democrats has one seat less (total: 69).</p>

			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / UK Company News: St Ives rises but shows concern over VAT threat ST IVES, the UK's largest independent printer, yesterday reported a 4.8 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 22.1m for the 52 weeks to July 30. However, Mr Miles Emley, presenting his first set of results since succeeding Mr Robert Gavron as chairman in May, said there had been little improvement in most of the group's markets and warned that the threat of imposition of VAT in the UK on some of its products 'represents a continuing uncertainty.' The Pounds 1m improvement in profits came from turnover ahead by 6.4 per cent to Pounds 221.3m. Earnings per share were unchanged at 15.2p. The recommended final dividend is increased to 4p (3.75p) making a 5.5p (5.25p) total. Profit margins at both the pre-interest and pre-tax levels were almost static at 9.5 per cent and 10 per cent respectively which Mr Emley said was 'a creditable result in trading conditions which have been far from easy.' He added that the modest recovery in the UK economy that was experienced towards the end of the financial year had been mainly export-led and had not benefited the group. The overall returns in the group's core UK magazine business were lower than in the previous year although Mr Emley said the downward pressure on prices had eased and in some cases the group had been able to agree price increases 'modestly in excess of inflation.' Conditions in the group's US markets, which account for 10 per cent of turnover, deteriorated in the second half leading to markedly lower volumes  -particularly in medical titles which were affected by the US government's healthcare review. Among St Ives other operations the book printing business boosted sales and, based on the group's reputation for thin paper printing, lifted its share of the international bible and reference book market. Looking ahead Mr Emley said: 'It is still too early to judge whether the current increase in activity represents more than a seasonal upturn.' COMMENT St Ives' results were in line with market expectations; however, Mr Emley's comments were cautious and the shares closed 3p lower at 299p, down from a peak of 346p in the spring. Shareholders' funds were just short of Pounds 100m at the year-end and the group had Pounds 21.6m of net cash, up from Pounds 13.5m a year earlier. Capital spending this year will be about Pounds 20m and, like the Pounds 106.9m spent in the past five years, will be financed from cash flow. The UK printing market remains tough and the US business is still losing money. But with a bit of a struggle pre-tax profits should reach Pounds 24m this year producing earnings of 16.4p and a prospective p/e of slightly over 18.</p>

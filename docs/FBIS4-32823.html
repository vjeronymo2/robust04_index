			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Rey Rodriguez from the NTV newscast] </F>   [Text] As part of the Cuban Foreign Ministry's diplomatic  offensive, a delegation headed by Foreign Minister Roberto  Robaina has departed for the Nonaligned Movement [NAM]  ministerial summit in Cairo. One of the summit's main goals is  to strengthen South-South cooperation as well as to draft  guidelines for the Movement's future. This was pointed out by  Robaina during a news conference. He also discussed other  important issues, such as the forthcoming Ibero-American summit:    [Begin recording] [Robaina] Three main issues dealing with  economic aspects and Latin American integration will be  discussed. In all likelihood, Cartagena will be a forum to  reaffirm the willingness of the Ibero-American peoples and where  Cuba will undoubtedly have to speak of the motives behind the  call to a hemispheric summit in Miami which excludes Cuba. It  is important to discuss our view on this maneuver in Cartagena.    Regarding the blockade, no one has the least doubt that  given  what was accomplished in Bahia...[pauses] I believe other things  happened after the Bahia summit. There was a strong resolution  of support at the United Nations, and there is an ever  increasing commitment among many countries, peoples, and  governments.    [Rodriguez] Minister, what is Cuba's position on the  hemispheric summit? Do you believe it is an alternative to the  Ibero-American summits?    [Robaina] I would say that, rather than an alternative, it  is  undoubtedly a maneuver to discredit, diminish the authority, and  overshadow the results of the Ibero-American summits. I also  believe that if the regional superpower really meant to meet  with every country in the region, it would have given more  consideration to events, time, and place. In my opinion, the  manner in which this has been organized speaks by itself of the  [words indistinct] what we have been doing with Ibero-America.  If we are not included, they still want to discuss Cuba which  has been singled out and toward that end selected Miami.    [Rodriguez] If Cuba were to be invited to the hemispheric  summit in Miami, would Cuba attend?    [Robaina] Rather than my opinion, it is the belief of the  country's leadership -- the president himself has said it --  that we are not afraid to attend any forum we are invited to no  matter where, even Miami. Cuba does not seek an invitation.  Even if Cuba had been invited to that summit, it would have  questioned the manner in which the summit was called, without  considering the participant countries' opinions. Cuba is  willing to go, however, and explain its project of truth and  work anywhere our presence is requested. [end recording]</p>

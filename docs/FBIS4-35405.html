			<p>BFN     [Text] At the Foreign Ministry's conferences room today,  brother Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, minister of planning and  development, met with the heads of brotherly and friendly  diplomatic missions in Sanaa. During the meeting, Dr. al-Iryani  spoke about the situation in our country and its developments.  He said: We are eager to meet with members of the diplomatic  corps in Sanaa to brief them on the Republic of Yemen's stand  toward previous cease-fire appeals and the subsequent move at  the UN Security Council. I believe that parties to any war  anywhere in the world appeal for cease-fires. There is nothing  strange in that. What is peculiar in Yemen's case is that such  cease-fire appeals do not offer an adequate solution to the  other party. In other words, everyone says: Stop fighting, but  they do not give any guarantees to prevent the resumption of  fighting. The farthest such appeals could go was to say: Stop  fighting and resume dialogue. Our colleagues in the diplomatic  corps in Sanaa are familiar with the nine-month crisis. During  that period, we did not stop dialogue. Yet, appeals say: Stop  fighting and resume dialogue. If any guarantees are made at  all, what about the aftermath of the cease-fire?    Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani said: You all remember that a  few days after the beginning of clashes, an Arab League  delegation came and met with the brother chairman. The brother  chairman told them: If you obtain guarantees from the other side  that they will not harm unity, legitimacy, and the unity of the  Armed Forces, we will halt fighting. When it left Sanaa, the  delegation was supposed to hold contacts with the other side to  secure those guarantees. However, no sooner had the delegation  arrived in Cairo than the mass media began to say that Sanaa  rejected a cease-fire. Moreover, the Arab League delegation  that visited Sanaa has so far said nothing about what the other  side said about the required guarantees for cease-fire or for  halting fighting in such a manner that maintains unity and  constitutional legitimacy, or whether they have made any  guarantees for ensuring the results of the April elections.  Those were the conditions that were conveyed to the Arab League.    Dr. al-Iryani said: During my recent visit to Saudi Arabia,  I met with the custodian of the two holy mosques. We requested  good offices within the framework of the same conditions that  were conveyed to whoever appealed for a cease-fire. At the end  of our discussions, I felt that there was readiness to exert all  possible efforts. The custodian of the two holy mosques  proposed a temporary cease-fire on the occasion of the blessed  'Id al-Adha. I carried the proposal to Sanaa. After elaborate  discussions, a three-day cease-fire on the occasion of 'Id  al-Adha was approved. That was the most visible evidence that  when Sanaa is asked to cease fire for a logical reason, this  only leads to a bigger problem than the fighting itself. Sanaa  responded to that request.    Addressing the heads of diplomatic corps, brother Dr.  'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani continued: You all are aware that  days--or rather hours--after that, al-Bid declared secession.  He foiled that attempt, which could have served as a 72-hour  chance for good offices to secure the guarantees that we had  demanded and to make sure that the cease-fire would hold.  Therefore, the first to abort any serious cease-fire attempt  were the secessionists, for they do not want to cease fire.    The brother minister of planning and development added:  What is new about this crisis is that it has become of topic of  interest to amateurs in international law. Some say: No unity  is imposed by force. I ask: How was the Yemeni unity achieved?  Did it take place four years ago through mutual consent or by  force? Two days ago, al-Bid acknowledged that the unity took  place through mutual consent. Now it is said that we are going  to impose unity by force. Such are the views of international  law amateurs. I remind you that we fought in 1972 to impose  unity by force. Then, it was the right of every state to object  to imposing unity by force. In 1973, the north wanted to impose  unity on the south. In the 1979 war, it was the opposite; the  south wanted to impose unity by force on the north. Then, every  state had the right to oppose imposing unity by force. But  unity now has been achieved and approved by the Yemeni people.  The Constitution of the new state has been approved through a  referendum. Legislative elections were held and the world  testified to their fairness. Yet, we are asked not to impose  unity by force. By all standards, this calls for amazement. To  say that Sanaa wants to impose unity by force calls for  amazement. The demand for new unity formulas is a foreign  rather than a Yemeni demand. The secessionists themselves have  declared secession. So, why the talk about a new unity formula?  They demand a new unity formula, while the secessionists have  already declared secession.    He added: Suddenly, the Security Council moved. I would  like to affirm that the republic respects international  organizations and their charters and abides by all legitimate  resolutions. I believe that even at the peak of crises, we did  not hesitate to comply with pertinent resolutions although we  had reservations about them. I said that we had asked the Arab  League to provide guarantees to us complying with legitimacy,  the existence of the Republic of Yemen, international law, and  rules pursued in any unified state in the world. However, the  Arab League disappeared completely. We heard nothing from them,  until the issue appeared at the Security Council. Our objection  to raising this issue at the Security Council proceeds from the  Paragraph Seven of Article Two of the UN Charter, which says  that nothing in this charter justifies UN intervention in any  state's domestic affairs. The UN Security Council's move, as we  heard, proceeds from Article 34, which says: The Security  Council is entitled to identify any conflict or any position  which might lead to international altercation or dispute. This  is in order to decide whether the continuation of this dispute  or position may jeopardize international peace and security.  Thus, the Security Council has the right to identify, but not  to debate and decide. It must determine whether what is going  on in Yemen is a source of threat to international peace and  security. However, we are amazed to hear that what is being  proposed is a draft resolution regarding which even Yemen has  not been consulted or advised.</p>

			<p><P> March 29, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CHILD INTERPRETERS  </P> <P> I believe it is shortsighted for Spanish-speaking immigrants to make their  children interpret for them ("Littlest Interpreters," March 1).  </P> <P> The immigrants who lived in my Brooklyn, N.Y., neighborhood came from all over  Europe. They knew they had to learn English, and fast, if they wanted to enjoy  the benefits of living in their adopted country.  </P> <P> They didn't claim they were being discriminated against because their children  were taught in English only, or because election ballots were printed only in  English.  </P> <P> I'll probably be stripped of my liberal credentials for my views, but so be it!  </P> <P> SUZANNE A. CHAPMAN  </P> <P> Orange  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Today Georgian Prime Minister Otar Patsatsia  received an EBRD delegation led by (Jonathan Roberts). The  meeting was attended by Deputy Prime Minister Zurab  Kervalishvili.    The bank's seven representatives and 11 consultants have  spent three weeks working in Georgia. Mr (Jonathan Roberts)  said their task was to gather full information on the situation  in Georgia and report to the bank's board, which is to meet in  the first week of July.    The conversation outlined the main aspects of the assistance  program for Georgia. These include restoring Georgia's energy  potential, developing the transport industry and  telecommunications. Georgia will receive vital credits if it  takes into account World Bank, IMF, and EBRD recommendations  which envisage raising tariffs to world levels.    It was noted that a number of necessary laws still did not  exist.    The prime minister thanked guests for their fruitful work  and  expressed the hope that it would be followed by tangible  assistance. Reviving the country's industry depends on the  development of power engineering and therefore it should be  given special attention. As for the transition to the market  economy, it is an irreversible process.</p>

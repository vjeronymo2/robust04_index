			<p><P> April 21, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SANDS OF TIME ARE PAYING OFF ON ONCE-BARE OCEANSIDE BEACHES  </P> <P> The Army Corps of Engineers has concluded that an experimental $12.3-million  project is successfully restoring sand to Oceanside's eroded beaches.  </P> <P> Despite some discouragement when the innovative pumping system fired up last  June, the corps now says it can distribute 120,000 cubic yards of sand a year  and probably much more.  </P> <P> Dana Whitson, the city's project manager, said experts realized by December  that the system had reached a milestone: "They were seeing sand build up at the  beach."  </P> <P> Equally important, the system has shown that it can prevent sand from blocking  the entrance to Oceanside Harbor, a problem that has required expensive  dredging.  </P> <P> The results have the city and the corps optimistic that Oceanside's chronic  beach erosion and harbor blockage problems can be solved if a $2.7-million  second phase of the project is approved by Congress.  </P> <P> Beaches have eroded, sometimes down to bare rock, since Camp Pendleton's boat  harbor and jetty were built in 1942, disrupting the natural southerly flow of  sand onto Oceanside beaches.  </P> <P> Congress authorized the project in 1982, but pumping didn't begin until last  June. Although the system quickly looked promising, it suffered equipment  failures and annoying delays.  </P> <P> But the corps, waiting until the system had operated during some of the winter  before deciding whether the state-of-the-art technology actually worked, has  judged it a success.  </P> <P> The corps' report says that "the gradual increase in beach width at the  disposal site . . . gives an indication of how the bypass can nourish the beach  by continually supplying sand and simulates a more natural method of beach  replenishment."  </P> <P> The system vacuums sand trapped at the entrance to Oceanside Harbor and the Del  Mar Boat Basin at Camp Pendleton and pumps it south to the beach through a  buried pipeline.  </P> <P> According to the corps, the system has moved up to 250 cubic yards of sand an  hour, but the average production is about 80 cubic yards an hour, or 120,000  cubic yards annually.  </P> <P> Whitson and the corps have told Congress that the system is not operating at  peak capacity, however, because the jet pumps leave a big hole where they suck  up sand. Not as much sand can be sent to the beaches because "time is required  for the waves and long-shore currents to refill the crater with sand in order  to resume pumping," the corps said.  </P> <P> Whitson said an additional $2.7-million federal appropriation would pay for the  installation of perforated pipes called "fluidizers" that would mix water and  sand to quickly replenish the crater.  </P> <P> The sand-pumping project is vital to replenish city beaches that, because of  their narrowness, have made coastal property vulnerable to storm damage,  Whitson said.  </P> <P> "A wide beach is the best possible protection from storm waves," she said.  </P></p>

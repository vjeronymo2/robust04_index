			<p><P> February 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VANDEWEGHE FINDS SPOT TO SHOOT DOWN CLIPPERS  </P> <P> Kiki Vandeweghe, one of the main characters in the Portland Trail Blazers'  season-long family feud, found his spot Wednesday night on the Sports Arena  floor.  </P> <P> "I just made a couple of jumpers, that's all," he said.  </P> <P> Three straight from the same spot, to be exact. Three jumpers from the right  baseline, a few steps in from the corner, in the final 2 minutes to bury the  Clippers and their bid to end a losing streak -- now at 16 -- and give the  Trail Blazers a 108-107 victory before a crowd of 9,991.  </P> <P> Vandeweghe, who has continually asked to be traded because of his reduced role  this season, scored 24 of his game-high 28 points in the second half. He also  finished with 6 assists.  </P> <P> The last of his jumpers came with 47 seconds left to put Portland ahead,  108-105. The Clippers closed to within a point on Joe Wolf's basket with 37  seconds left and then had a chance to win when Wolf grabbed Terry Porter's  errant pass.  </P> <P> The Clippers called time out with 9 seconds remaining and designed a play that  was supposed to go to Charles Smith, who scored 22 points. But Tom Garrick, a  shooting guard starting at the point in Gary Grant's absence, was covered  closely by Clyde Drexler as he neared the right side of the lane. Garrick  couldn't get the ball to Smith.  </P> <P> Garrick, who had 14 points, 10 assists and only 2 turnovers, went down the  middle and took a 7-foot shot that hit the front of the rim. Wolf got a finger  on the ball for a last-second tip, but that didn't go down, either.  </P> <P> "I felt comfortable with it," Garrick said. "I was in the middle of the lane.  Some people would look at it as off-balance, but I like those shots, so I took  it."  </P> <P> Said Don Casey, after the Clippers fell to 10-33, 0-5 in his tenure as interim  coach: "Driving the middle against a team like this is a disaster because they  close in so fast."  </P> <P> With their roster already reduced to 10 players because Grant was in Ohio with  his sick mother and Grant Gondrezick was suspended indefinitely while in a  substance abuse center, the Clippers lost their second-leading scorer with 59  seconds to play in the second quarter.  </P> <P> Ken Norman, who scored 22 points in Monday's loss against the Atlanta Hawks,  was ejected with Portland's Jerome Kersey when they got into a fight.  </P> <P> With play going on, they squared off under the basket, standing nearly  nose-to-nose for a few seconds before Kersey pushed Norman in the chest. Norman  countered by landing a hard right, and the 6-foot 7-inch Kersey retaliated with  a right that sent the 6-8 Norman to the floor.  </P> <P> Norman got up quickly, just in time to see the referees directing him to the  locker room.  </P> <P> The Clippers were leading, 57-48, at the time and held a 59-50 halftime  advantage.  </P> <P> They increased the lead to 65-52 with 10:48 to play in the third quarter, but  then suddenly began looking like the team that got trampled in the second half  against the Hawks.  </P> <P> The Trail Blazers, winners of 16 straight against the Clippers, tied the score,  84-84, at the end of the third quarter with a 14-4 run.  </P> <P> Clipper Notes  </P> <P> With 233 assists this season going into Wednesday night's game, Norm Nixon has  moved past John Havlicek and Jerry West and into seventh place on the National  Basketball Assn. all-time list. Nixon, in his 10th season, has 6,280 career  assists, putting him 196 behind Nate Archibald for sixth place. Oscar Robertson  is No. 1 with 9,887. "I haven't been aware of anything like that this season,"  Nixon said. "This isn't one of those years to be into stats."  </P> <P> The Clippers and Dallas Mavericks have discussed a trade that would send Mark  Aguirre to Los Angeles, Ken Norman being mentioned most as the player who would  go in exchange, although it doesn't appear to be any closer to completion than  the Mavericks' dealings with several other teams. "My impression is that  they're talking to a lot of people, including us," Clipper president Alan  Rothenberg said. "But nothing is imminent. I think they (the Mavericks) are  conducting a bit of an auction, hearing what one team has to offer and then  taking it to other teams to see if they can top it." Said General Manager Elgin  Baylor: "We've been talking to Dallas for the last 3 years about Mark Aguirre."  The most glamorous deal mentioned: Aguirre to Detroit for Adrian Dantley, with  a few other players thrown in for good measure. A holdup to a deal with most  teams would be Aguirre's salary. The eighth-year player earns $715,700 this  season, but he and Dallas owner Donald Carter have already "agreed to agree" to  about double that figure sometime soon after March 4. League rules stipulate  that a year must pass between contract adjustments.  </P> <P> Baylor said the team didn't consider it a risk to sign Grant Gondrezick as a  free agent before the season, despite a link to the Phoenix Suns'  well-publicized cocaine problems during the 1986-87 season. "After talking to  him and talking to his agent, we felt pretty safe with the player," Baylor  said.  </P></p>

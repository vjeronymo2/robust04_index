			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Shares advance as new account opens A DOLEFUL trading account in the UK equity market came to a relatively optimistic close last night, as share prices brushed off the initially bearish effects of the government's poor showing at the polls and turned higher as they moved into the new trading account. Early deals saw the FT-SE Index down by 14 points, following the electoral trouncing of Mr Major's governing Conservative party in Britain's county council polls and its rout at an important parliamentary by-election. But, with sterling and government bonds steady, equities had already rallied before the final hour of trading. That final hour saw the market moving into the new trading period which brought a wave of support. The FT-SE Index closed 7.4 up at 2,793.7 in good turnover. Excitement was fuelled by reports that the big securities houses were actively preparing the underwriting on the Pounds 1.3bn rights issue of Zeneca shares, to be priced on Wednesday as the ICI demerger moves towards zero hour. The reports of underwriting activity alarmed the market's takeover bid pundits, some of whom pushed United Biscuits higher in the closing minutes of the session. At the day's low point, the Footsie touched 2,772.2 which is seen as the extreme low end of the present trading range. Consequently, the late recovery represented a significant reinforcement of some current strategies in the UK market, especially as there was little encouragement from Wall Street when it opened its new session. At last night's close, the FT-SE 100 was down 19.4 on a week in which the City has been slow to return to work after the May Day break. Over the three-week account, extended to cover the holiday weekend, the London market has fallen by about 1 per cent, largely on worries about the US economy. Those worries have been highlighted by suggestions that big investors have been moving into gold bullion and shares. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, again slow to follow the blue chips, closed 5.2 off at 3,109.5 yesterday. Although 22.6 down on the week, the Mid 250 Index has gained 1.2 per cent over the account; second-line issues have been less exposed than the FT-SE 100 stocks to sudden swings in the stock index futures market. Seaq volume remained high at 614.6m shares, compared with 681.5m on Thursday when retail business totalled Pounds 1.37bn.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] United Nations, New York, June 21, IRNA -- Iran held  Baghdad responsible for the aggressions of Iraqi-based  counter-revolutionaries on Iranian territory and said that the  government of Iraq would be responsible for its consequences.  Iran's permanent representative to the U.N. Kamal Kharrazi in a  letter to the U.N. secretary general termed the June 4th  infiltration of counter-revolutionary elements into the Iranian  territory as explicit violation of the cease-fire between the  two countries.    According to the letter, a number of counter-revolutionary  elements crossed the border and penetrated 4 kilometres inside  the Iranian territory in Ilam Province and opened fire on the  Iranian forces on Eyn-Ghazal and south Halaleh road. As a  result, two Iranians were martyred and four others, including  one sergeant and three soldiers, were captured by them.</p>

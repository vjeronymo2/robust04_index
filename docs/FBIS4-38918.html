The Armenian positions in [place-name indistinct], Tauz, and  Lernak in Mardakertskiy Rayon; Shuraabad, [place-name  indistinct], and Gyullyudzha in Agdamskiy Rayon; and  Karakhanbeyli in Fizulinskiy Rayon were fired on with various  types of arms today. The Armenian side refrained from returning  the fire. Considering Azerbaijan failed to sign the agreement  in Moscow to end the confrontation, the NKR Defense Army is  convinced that enemy units will launch a wide-scale attack very  soon.

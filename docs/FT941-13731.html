			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / The Markets: Tax squeeze may force G7 to revitalise economic co-operation - Economics Notebook The world's most exclusive club is in decline. A year ago, Mr Lloyd Bentsen, freshly in-stalled as US Treasury Secretary, was champing at the bit to breathe new life into the Group of Seven countries, comprising the US, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada. As finance minister of the world's most potent industrial democracy, he appeared to believe that more co-operation and less megaphone diplomacy among the G7 could ease, if not solve, problems as diverse as Europe's mass unemployment and faltering economic reform in Russia. This month, Mr Bentsen has been globe-trotting, but mainly in east Asia. His talks in Japan yesterday were tacked onto a round-the-world trip that started in Moscow and continued in Indonesia, Thailand and China. Little has been heard of the G7 of late. After years of huffing and puffing over trade, it took a back seat in the final negotiations that secured the Uruguay Round trade agreement in December. US President Bill Clinton's plans for a special G7 meeting to tackle unemployment, proposed last summer, have been painfully slow in reaching fruition. After many delays, a meeting of labour and finance ministers has been scheduled for mid-March, although officials are still unclear what will be discussed. G7 leaders, including Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, have cast doubt on the value of their annual economic summit. The meeting will be held again this year - in Naples between July 8 and 10 - but is likely to be a low key event compared with past extravaganzas. The group appears to have decided that a low profile is the safest approach to the present difficulties in Russia. In the past, the G7 has tried to guide events with an economic carrot and stick. The only known response to last week's exit of economic reformers from the government in Moscow was a telephone call among senior officials on Friday which seems to have reached no clear conclusions. There is strong case for saying that such reticence is all to the good. International co-operation can create rather than solve difficulties. Arguably, some of the problems of the late 1980s - Japan's bubble economy and the UK's high inflation, for example - can be blamed in part on over-enthusiastic attempts to co-ordinate exchange rates and monetary policies among the G7. Instead of grand international gestures, G7 nations in recent years have concentrated on solving their own domestic economic problems first. Whether by accident or design, one positive result has been a fall in inflation to levels last seen in the 1960s. The upper chart, based on projections in the December Economic Outlook from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, suggests that big industrial countries, by pursuing the Sinatra doctrine and 'doing it my way', may be returning to synchronised and steady growth. But the bottom chart, showing how taxes are due to rise as a share of national output in Germany, Britain, Japan and the US, prompts some second thoughts. The lines on the chart do not seem to rise dramatically. But they constitute a large scale fiscal contraction in countries that together account for two thirds of OECD output. Only now is debate getting underway about the impact of the tax rises in the countries concerned and opinions vary widely. In the UK, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Stephen Dorrell, the financial secretary, admit that the Pounds 8.4bn of tax increases due in 1994-95 will check the pace of recovery but are confident that the upturn can be maintained. Others are less sure, hence the pressure for lower interest rates. Similar uncertainty surrounds the impact of higher US federal taxes which will take effect very soon. Mr Allen Sinai, chief economist of Lehman Brothers, told a recent investors' conference in London that the higher tax rates, which are concentrated among wealthier households, are 'simply too small in total and too narrowly focused to bring the economy down'. Taking the opposite view last week was Mr Lacy Hunt, the chief US economist of HSBC Holdings, which now has Midland Bank among its group members. He estimates that the tax increases will take Dollars 500m (Pounds 338m) a week from consumers. This may seem small in a Dollars 6 trillion-a-year economy. But Mr Hunt contends that the average US personal income tax rate will reach a new record of 20 per cent this year and that the households most affected by the higher taxes account for 18 per cent of consumers' expenditure. The outcome, he says, will be a drop in the economic growth rate to 1.5 per cent next year. Germany's tax plans put other nations in the shade. The Bonn government's annual economic report, to be published this week, is expected to project increases of between 4.5 and 5.5 per cent in government revenues this year as part of a multi-year programme of tax rises to pay for unification. The OECD estimates that by 1995 western Germany will have experienced a cumulative increase in its tax to GDP ratio of 5 percentage points since unification. While Bonn believes the German economy should grow by 1 per cent to 1.5 per cent this year, economists are sceptical. Mr Gerald Holtham, Lehman Brothers' chief international economist in London, believes Germany faces 'unprecedented consumer weakness' because of the government's actions. It is highly unlikely that the combined impact of these independent fiscal squeezes has been discussed by the politicians responsible for them. It may be that world growth is sufficiently dynamic to overcome the contractionary forces involved. However, it would be reassuring to know that potential pitfalls have been considered. The G7 would be a good place to start.</p>

			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / International Company News: Nordic Investment Bank ahead Nordic Investment Bank, jointly owned by the five Nordic countries, yesterday reported a 26 per cent rise in profits before allocations in 1993 to Ecu64m (Dollars 56m), from Ecu51m in 1992. The Helsinki-based bank, a leading western investor in the Baltic states, said net interest income grew 36 per cent to Ecu101m, but attributed much of this to its switch during the year to the Ecu as its currency of account and capital. The bank said it had charged Ecu3.1m against profits to cover loan losses. But it boasted that unlike other loan-loss hit Nordic banks, it had only two non-performing loans in its lending portfolio which at the year-end totalled Ecu4.5bn. The bank said it had retained its triple A credit rating - the only Nordic banking institution to have done so.</p>

			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> VIEWPOINTS;  </P> <P> IS CONSUMERISM A REBEL CAUSE?;  </P> <P> PUBLIC OPINION WATCHERS SEE A MOVEMENT BUT AREN'T SURE IT CAN BE CALLED A  REVOLT  </P> <P> On several fronts, consumerism appears to be on the rise. Consumers have  protested everything from the handling of the Exxon Valdez oil spill to the  rise of "reality-based" television to the use of pesticides. Earlier this  month, another blow was struck for consumerism when the U.S. Supreme Court  upheld most of California's Proposition 103 initiative to tighten regulation of  the insurance industry. Does all of this signal the start of a powerful and  widespread consumer revolt? What's influencing the changing mood of consumers,  and what are its implications? Times researcher Melanie Pickett raised these  questions with various people who keep a close eye on public opinion, and  excerpts of their comments follow.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Andrew Kohut, president of the Gallup Organization:  </P> <P> "The most important thing to recognize is that a Populist attitude toward  American business is a fundamental American value. Americans consistently  believe that companies have profits that are way too large, and feel that large  companies have too much power. And when they see incidents such as Valdez, or  they read about pesticide pollution or what have you, it strikes a chord that  resonates with the public. They are situations that tap into people's general  distrust of business. Whether consumerism will become once again a very  focused, crystallized movement in the way it was in the early '70s, I don't  know. I don't have any evidence of that. . . .  </P> <P> "One of the important values that animates public opinion is the suspicion of  business. . . . What our studies show is that the feeling is greater among  women than it is among men, that women tend to be consumerist to a far greater  degree than men, and that older people are much more suspicious of the motives  and power of American business than younger people. So if you're going to find  a rebirth of consumerism, it is probably not going to be among young people.  It's going to be among middle-aged and older people, and it's probably going to  be among women."  </P> <P> Paul Ambrosino, a San Francisco political consultant:  </P> <P> "Just watching debate, listening to candidates and looking at referendums, I  think it would be an overstatement to suggest that a consumer revolt is out  there in the making. You may get some initial reactions, such as an AK-47 ban,  that will dominate public policy as a dramatic event takes place as in  Stockton. And who knows if you'll see some sort of similar type initiative as a  result of the (Exxon Valdez oil spill) or an incident like that.  </P> <P> "I think what's going on in places like California is that some of the  traditional (consumer issues) that have been debated for a long, long time  without being resolved are going to end up more and more on the ballot. (People  are) figuring out that what they can't get in the legislature, they can put  before consumers and voters through initiatives. The successful passage of the  insurance proposition is likely to whet the appetite of activists to go after  other items they have not been able to achieve in the legislative process. I'm  not sure I think that's a consumer revolt, I think it's the interests taking  the battleground to a different arena.  </P> <P> "What I think you see in the citizens out there is that they are receptive to  voting in favor of those types of measures. . . . Until consumers sense they  lose by passing one of these, you can always find people interested in giving  themselves a break at the expense of a large institution or company."  </P> <P> Craig Gordon, director of Grassroots Research, which tracks new products and  trends:  </P> <P> "The consumer is getting more active. I don't know if it's a revolt yet. . . .  Manufacturers have become real sensitive to it. Almost every consumer product  now has an "800" complaint line. A lot of manufacturers have discovered they'd  rather have the person vent the frustration at them instead of going to other  avenues, whether it's government or boycotting the product or whatever. There's  a lot more choices and a lot less brand loyalty than there was before. . . . I  think businesses are becoming more aware of how important it is to get the  consumer in the decision-making process."  </P> <P> Dave Stewart, marketing professor at the USC Graduate School of Business:  </P> <P> "If you look at the whole history of the consumer movement in the U.S., it has  tended to go in cycles. And I think we've come through a cycle where there has  been a de-emphasis on regulation, a de-emphasis on protecting the consumer.  Consumers have been more dormant.  </P> <P> "We are probably now moving into another up cycle because of a host of things  that have come to the fore: concerns about the oil spill, concerns about  general increases in the price of oil, concerns about pesticides, we could go  on and on. These things are now beginning to receive more play in the press,  they receive a receptive ear. In addition, the Bush Administration seems to be  more open to regulation so that the Federal Trade Commission, among others, has  shown evidence of beginning to become more active. They've been pushed somewhat  as well by more activist groups of state attorneys general. I think it's fair  to say we're seeing an upsurge. How far it will go I think remains to be seen.  </P> <P> "What you'll begin to see -- (and) already are beginning to see -- are efforts  on the part of industry to tell its story so that the people have more  information, more correct information. You'll see companies running more  campaigns that document what they're doing to clean up the environment. And  there are a number of companies which are well known already for that kind of  campaign -- Weyerhaeuser has for years talked about the number of trees it  plants as opposed to the number they chop down. You'll hear more of that so  that business gets across the idea that there is another side to the story,  that they do try to behave responsibly."  </P> <P> Michael Cunningham, associate professor of psychology at the University of  Louisville:  </P> <P> "Look at demographics -- that's the first issue. One of the facts of political  life is that the baby boom generation that was always somewhat cynical toward  institutions is becoming more politically potent. The second aspect is that the  education level in America, although incredibly uneven in its distribution, is  gradually creeping upward. There are more college-educated people who tend to  be skeptical of what is offered to them.  </P> <P> "Those two highly correlated demographic facts mean there are opportunities for  people to be engaged in political activities on those things that touch their  lives.  </P> <P> "Now, regulation gets to be a very tricky issue. One of the interesting facts  is those people who are cynical about business are also cynical about  government. One fragment goes for greater regulation and that will be  continuing to increase. But another group probably has two types in its numbers  -- one are the Reagan 'true believers' who believe in deregulation and don't  believe in government intrusion, and a second group that is cynical about  government and prefers to handle things on the local level. Some people will  say, for example, 'Let's regulate apples. Make sure there's no Alar.' The other  group will say, 'Well, let's just buy organic and let's not waste our time  trying to move through Congress a series of regulations.'  </P> <P> "A consumer movement is going to, I suspect, be a very fragmented thing.  Different types of industries will encounter different types of pressure groups  because behind the consumer movement are a series of very different kinds of  people with very different kinds of agendas."  </P> <P> Gary Flint, director of Consumer Protection Agency, a nonprofit foundation:  </P> <P> "California has probably the best consumer protection laws in the country. What  concerns a lot of consumers is not that we have inadequate laws, it's just that  it's not possible to enforce every law in every case.  </P> <P> "In general, if you have more regulation than we have now, it could hurt the  consumer. . . . We have to retrain our thought to be more goal oriented than  legislation oriented. The government became too big, in many ways, in the '60s,  which actually hurt the consumers. It raised taxes and increased the size of  government. . . . If you were to ask people across the country what they think  about consumerism today as opposed to the way it was several years ago, I think  they'd say there is somewhat of a voter revolt afoot."  </P> <P> Ed Zwick, co-producer of the television show "thirtysomething":  </P> <P> "Deregulation in a lot of areas isn't immediately perceived but I think it  clearly is now beginning to be, and its implications for consumer issues are  pretty obvious. The real interesting question over the next number of years  will be whether what now seems to be a grass-roots sense of indignation will  translate into any real shift in policy politically. Has consumerism been  enough of an issue to sway electoral politics and legislation? Not in recent  memory. . . . Will it become more important? I feel certain candidates (are)  beginning to position themselves as the beneficiaries of what they perceive to  be a movement."  </P></p>

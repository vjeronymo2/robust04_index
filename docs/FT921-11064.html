			<p>920203 FT  03 FEB 92 / International Company News: Sanyo slips 3.8% despite sales rise SANYO Electric, the Japanese electronics maker, announced a rise of 12.5 per cent in consolidated pre-tax profits, to Y39.9bn (Dollars 324.4m) for the year to November, 1991. The result was struck on a 7.8 per cent rise in sales, to Y1,587.1bn, writes Emiko Terazono. Operating profit rose only 1.9 per cent to Y49.5bn, due to increased competition and foreign exchange losses caused by the yen's sharp rise against the dollar. After-tax profit fell 3.8 per cent to Y16.8bn due to increased corporate taxes.</p>

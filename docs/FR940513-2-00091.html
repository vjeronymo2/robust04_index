Dissemination and Utilization  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purposes and expectations associated with Title IV discretionary projects extend well beyond the immediate confines of a particular project's local impact. Projects should have a ripple effect in the field of aging in terms of replicating their design, utilizing their results, and applying their benefits to a widening circle of older persons. This section suggests certain principles of dissemination to be considered in developing your application:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;the most useful projects make dissemination and utilization a central, not peripheral, component of the project;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;dissemination starts at the beginning of a project not when it is completed;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;potential users should be involved in planning the project, if possible, and products developed with the needs of potential users in mind;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;dissemination is a networking process;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;at a minimum, dissemination includes getting your final products into the hands of appropriate users and making presentations at conferences; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;coordination with other related projects may increase the chances of your products being used.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> J. Completing the Application  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In completing the application, please recognize that the set of standardized forms and instructions is prescribed by the Office of Management and Budget (approved under OMB control number 0348&hyph;0043) and is not perfectly adaptable to the particulars of AoA's Discretionary Funds Program. First-time applicants, in particular, may have some misgivings that they have not crossed the final ``t'' or dotted the last ``i'' of their application. Any applicant should, of course, take reasonable care to avoid technical errors in completing the application, but the substantive merits of the project proposal are the determining factors. In these instructions, we offer several pointers aimed at clarifying matters, overcoming difficulties, and preventing the more common technical mistakes made by applicants. If the need arises, please call (202) 619&hyph;0441 for assistance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Forms SF 424, SF 424A, SF 424B, and the certification forms (regarding lobbying; debarment, suspension, and other responsibility matters; and drug-free workplace requirements) have been reprinted as part of this  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  announcement for your convenience in preparing the application.

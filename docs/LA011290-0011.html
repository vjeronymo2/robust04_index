			<p><P> January 12, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CUT A RISING, REGRESSIVE TAX, UNMASK THE MONSTER DEFICIT;  </P> <P> SOCIAL SECURITY: REVENUES ARE BEING USED FOR THE SLOW, SURREPTITIOUS  SEMI-REPEAL OF A GREAT LIBERAL ACHIEVEMENT: HEAVY RELIANCE ON THE INCOME TAX.  </P> <P> The first tick of the clock on New Year's Day triggered another phase of one of  the nine tax increases of the nine Reagan-Bush years. And this year will be  just 23 days old when Sen. Pat Moynihan proposes a bill to repeal this most  recent tax increase, and thereby begin to stop "the leakage of reality from  American life."  </P> <P> Moynihan (D-N.Y.) would repeal the Social Security tax hike. That increase was  proposed by the 1983 Greenspan Commission, of which he was a member. He also  would further cut the Social Security tax rate on Jan. 1, 1991. This would  sharply increase the reported budget deficit (by $62 billion through 1991  alone), but only by revealing what the government's real operating deficit is.  </P> <P> Moynihan's measure would stop the swelling of a huge Social Security surplus.  By including that surplus (and those of other trust funds) in the unified  budget, the real deficit -- approaching $300 billion -- is cut in half,  cosmetically.  </P> <P> The Greenspan Commission proposed the Social Security tax increases to build  reserves for the population "bubble" of baby-boom retirees next century. But  the reserves are not being reserved. They are being spent, masking the real  deficit. So either way, large tax increases will be needed in the future. By  making it official that Social Security is an intergenerational  transfer-payment program, on a pay-as-you-go basis, Moynihan would make the  real deficit -- the gap between government outlays and non-Social Security  revenues -- visible.  </P> <P> Moynihan is practicing sauce-for-the-gander politics, doing for Democrats what  Reagan and Stockman did to Democrats. In 1981, Reagan and Stockman said to  themselves, in effect: Maybe our tax cuts will be self-financing -- so  stimulative to the economy that no deficit will occur. But if not, the deficits  will serve a political good by applying pressure for restraint on the growth of  government.  </P> <P> Moynihan denounced this reckless abuse of fiscal policy for political purposes.  But now he, too, is willing, and rightly so, to reduce the revenue base of the  government for therapeutic purposes. In 1983, he supported the schedule of  Social Security tax increases on the assumption that the surpluses would be put  to some use other than the perpetuation of fraud, the disguising of the  government's operating deficit.  </P> <P> Ideally, Moynihan's proposal would confront the government with the need either  to make politically difficult spending cuts or adopt more candid, rational and  equitable revenue sources to shrink the real huge deficit, suddenly made  visible. Alas, as the 1980s showed, there is a third course -- a borrowing  binge to finance the deficits. However, a necessary precondition for sound  policy is a willingness to face facts, such as this: After five years under  Gramm-Rudman, the government's operating deficit is growing.  </P> <P> Some liberals may flinch from Moynihan's radical budget surgery. Because  taxophobia is the strongest political passion today, some liberals believe that  the flow of Social Security tax dollars is necessary for domestic spending  programs. But liberals cannot remain liberals and remain collaborators in the  current process whereby Social Security revenues are used for the slow,  surreptitious semi-repeal of a great liberal achievement: the 16th Amendment,  and heavy reliance on the income tax.  </P> <P> This has been happening, with the connivance of a Democratic-controlled  Congress. Federal taxes in the first year of the Bush Administration are about  what they were in the last year of the Carter Administration, around 19% of  GNP. What the "Reagan revolution" changed radically is the incidence of  taxation. Income taxes were cut and made less progressive. The regressive  Social Security tax rate (the same rate for all payers; income above $51,300 is  exempt) increased 25% in the 1980s. Now the burden of the Social Security tax  (including the employer's share) is larger than the income-tax burden for 74%  of all taxpayers.  </P> <P> Conservatives, too, should rally 'round Moynihan, and not just because some of  them have never met a tax cut they didn't like. Thoughtful conservatives fear  that the Social Security surplus, perhaps supplemented by a "peace dividend"  carved from the defense budget, may be used by liberals to fund new government  programs, perhaps addressing the most pervasive anxiety of the 1990s -- health  care for an aging population of parents who caused the baby boom.  </P> <P> Spending, say, $50 billion on a continuing basis for a politically well-crafted  program could, says Texas' Republican Sen. Phil Gramm, "move millions of  votes." Gramm fears a paradox: The anti-communist rebellion against statism in  the Soviet Bloc could give rise to a defense-cutting euphoria that, combined  with Social Security surpluses, results in too much government here.  </P> <P> That is one possible choice. But before the choosing begins, Moynihan's bill, a  blow for candor and equity, should be passed. It would deprive Democrats and  Republicans of the choice of continuing the pretense that the deficit is  disappearing.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast] </F>   [Text] A demonstration and rally in honor of Crimean  Constitution Day were held in Simferopol today. By a decree of  Yuriy Meshkov, the president of the republic, this day has been  declared a holiday. The Crimean constitution was adopted on 6  May 1992 and, as the participants in the rally pointed out, it  reflects most fully the aspirations of Crimeans. It envisions  that Crimea's relations with Ukraine will be based on a treaty  and agreements. It stipulates the right to dual citizenship and  independence vis-a-vis other states. However, at the insistence  of the Ukrainian leadership, these articles were removed. They  do not appear in the present, official constitution. The  Crimean Republic Movement and a number of other parties and  public organizations have been campaigning for the restoration  of the original wording. Participants in a poll of Crimean  citizens recently called for a revision of the constitution.  Evidently this is why President Yuriy Meshkov decided that  constitution day should be celebrated on 6 May, rather than some  other day.    Addressing the rally, Meshkov said that Crimea had signed a  treaty with the administration of Moscow and that a treaty would  soon be signed with the Russian Federation. Crimean  Constitution Day was also celebrated by patriotic forces in  Sevastopol and by citizens of other towns.</p>

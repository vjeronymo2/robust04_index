			<p><P> August 4, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COURT OFFICIAL TO JOIN DRUG PROGRAM, AVOIDING A TRIAL  </P> <P> Robert K. Tuller Jr., who resigned as a court commissioner in Fullerton after  he was caught with cocaine, won the chance Friday to avoid prosecution if he  completes a rehabilitation program.  </P> <P> Municipal Court Judge Gary P. Ryan permitted Tuller to join a program in which  first-time drug offenders have charges against them dismissed once they finish  a court-ordered recovery program.  </P> <P> During a brief court appearance by Tuller, Ryan told him that the one felony  count of cocaine possession will be dismissed Feb. 8 -- as long as Tuller  continues his once-a-week group therapy sessions at Fullerton's St. Jude  Hospital and Rehabilitation Center and attends three sessions per week of  Narcotics Anonymous.  </P> <P> Tuller, wearing a tie clip bearing a tiny figure of the scales of justice,  declined to speak with reporters after the hearing. But his attorney, Lloyd L.  Freeberg Jr., said Tuller believes that his arrest and subsequent enrollment in  therapy, however painful, has made him "a better person in the long run."  </P> <P> Tuller, 46, was arrested May 11 in an Anaheim hotel room after buying $100 in  cocaine from a police informant. The informant had told police earlier that he  had used cocaine with Tuller many times during the last 10 years.  </P> <P> Days after his arrest, Tuller enrolled in a drug rehabilitation program at the  Betty Ford Center in Rancho Mirage. Soon after his release, he resigned from  his job as commissioner of Municipal Court in Fullerton, a post to which the  judges of that court appointed him in 1986. His colleagues said they never had  a hint that he was a drug abuser.  </P> <P> Friday, Deputy Dist. Atty. Carl W. Armbrust argued against allowing Tuller into  the so-called "diversion" program, saying that although Tuller meets the legal  requirements, he is not a suitable candidate.  </P> <P> "It doesn't seem reasonable that a person who has graduated from snorting to  freebasing is the type of person who should be allowed into the diversion  program," Armbrust said.  </P> <P> The prosecutor said Tuller had told the Probation Department that he had used  cocaine just four or five times in the last year -- but that Tuller told police  after his arrest that he had used the drug three times a month.  </P> <P> Armbrust also noted a statement by Tuller in the police report in which he said  he "got help once" for his drug problem but "went back to using again."  </P> <P> That statement is a misquote, said Freeberg, who also said Tuller had never  been in any other recovery program.  </P> <P> What Tuller told the police was that he had tried to solve his drug problem on  his own and had failed, his attorney said.  </P> <P> After the hearing, Armbrust said he is disappointed that Tuller was permitted  into the diversion program, because he said Tuller ought to be prosecuted, at  least in part because of the position of public trust that he held.  </P> <P> "I feel that attorneys and judges should be held to a higher standard than  others," the prosecutor said.  </P> <P> Tuller is scheduled to return to court Feb. 8 for a determination on whether  the charge will be dismissed.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TWINNING ART WITH EVIL;  </P> <P> CHEKHOV'S SISTER A NOVEL BY W.D. WETHERELL (LITTLE, BROWN: $16.95; 288 PP.)  </P> <P> W.D. Wetherell's new novel, "Chekhov's Sister," is a meditation on the  melancholy nature of the 20th Century, a time of brutality, alienation, a lack  of human values: what the author calls the end of history. But he is not wholly  without hope: The creation of art, and its subsequent preservation, is a record  of mankind's soul, an expression of mankind's heart, and as long as these two  organs remain alive, there exists a possibility of redemption from our sadness.  </P> <P> The majority of the novel's action takes place in Yalta, during World War II.  The Germans have invaded Russia, and all of the uncertainties of occupation  prevail. Chekhov has been dead since 1904, yet, nearly 40 years later, his  sister, Maria Pavlovna Chekhov, keeps a shrine to his life and art (a confusion  that will put her in moral and physical jeopardy) at his home in Yalta, where  his desk must be kept exactly as he liked it when he was alive -- his  bookshelves undusted because this was the only way he could tell which books he  hadn't recently read.  </P> <P> Kunin, a young man with a club foot who aspires to being a writer but shows  little talent or desire to practice his craft, helps Maria Pavlovna keep this  sacred place along with her faithful Maid, Varka.A shadowy manservant,  Gerassim, also helps, but without the dog-like spirit of the others: He has no  difficulty hacking a portrait of Tolstoy to bits on the eve of the German  occupation.  </P> <P> When the Germans do arrive, Maria Pavlovna finds an ally in Nazi Minister of  Culture Rene Diskau. Diskau had translated her brother's work into German, and  now he seeks to stage a performance of "The Seagull" in an effort to win  Russian minds and hearts. In her zeal to have the play once more performed,  Maria Pavlovna does not question her seeming collaboration with the enemy; her  devotion to one cause blinds her to the moral turpitude of her actions.  </P> <P> But Diskau is not one of the faithful; instead, he represents, along with  Gerassim (who turns out to be a Russian partisan), the world, or politics.  These men lack human values, and live in a dangerous and deadly reality as  separate from art as Maria Pavlovna is from political concerns.  </P> <P> The play will go on after the importation of an actress to play Nina, a lovely,  shimmering creature who has been rescued from an SS bordello for the part, who  is dying of tuberculosis (as Chekhov himself did) and whose artistry cannot be  questioned. She (and Chekhov) represent the third category of beings, those who  are artists, and who, alone, have the ability to transcend base reality through  the flights of their imaginations. They are the only ones without fierce tunnel  vision, the ones who comprehend something broader, sadder, deeper about the  human spirit. Of course, these three polarized groups will clash; of course,  life will be lost, as the other "character," the 20th Century itself, propels  them toward different types of destruction.  </P> <P> The novel is beautifully, lyrically written, and in its questioning of what  both art and reality are, its form as well as its content voices its concerns.  Wetherell uses the play form, in four acts (like "The Seagull"), to begin  sections of the book; he also uses dramatic monologue, remembrance and straight  fictional narrative to clue us as to where he stands in the moral battle  between art and reality, human values and politics. Its structure mirrors its  themes, in a gorgeous stylistic symmetry, giving the novel more cohesion than  most contemporary fiction.  </P> <P> Art, Devotion, the World: Like a tarot deck of mysterious meaning, Wetherell's  half-fictional realm (Chekhov really did have a sister; she really did preserve  his final home as a museum) moves ineluctably toward its climax in a rhythmic  river of narrative that is completely hypnotic.  </P> <P> It is only at the end, when the narrative lets go, that questions arise, mostly  about Maria Pavlovna herself, and the faithful as a group. Can collaboration  ever be justified? Can art be twinned with pure evil and still remain an  unsullied expression of the human spirit? Can art actually redeem the 20th  Century? Finally, the concerns of the novel begin to seem precious and small  when one thinks of the horrors of the time it documents; one performance of  "The Seagull" cannot save the lives of millions in the concentration camps,  cannot stop the inevitable cruelty of the century.  </P> <P> Where Wetherell and his fine novel stand on this issue remains unclear, though  this may be the only failing of this fascinating account of belief,  disappointment, zealotry and the human soul.  </P></p>

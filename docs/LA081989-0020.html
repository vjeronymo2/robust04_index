			<p><P> August 19, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RELIGION'S ROLE IN BATTLING TERRORISM  </P> <P> Casey Kasem insists on razor-sharp distinctions in his letter of Aug. 9. He  calls it a lie that Egypt began hostilities to open the 1967 war, when, in  fact, Israel struck first, even if pre-emptively.  </P> <P> Nonsense, Casey! Egypt did more than saber-rattling; she struck the first blow  -- and also the second. She opened the hostilities by closing the Straits of  Tiran to Israel. International law dictates that closing an international  waterway to any nation is a declaration of war. Furthermore, in doing so, Egypt  violated the terms of her own pact as made with Israel following the 1956 Sinai  war, namely, never to block the waterway.  </P> <P> The second strike, tantamount to a declaration of war by Egypt, was when  (then-President Gamal Abdel) Nasser demanded of the Secretary General of the  United Nations at the time, U Thant, to withdraw the U.N. peacekeeping force  stationed between Israel and the Sinai Peninsula. Nasser explained that he was  going to engage Israel militarily at any hour. U Thant complied and the rest is  history.  </P> <P> As a matter of fact, there was still another provocation of even greater  proportion. Nasser influenced Iraq, Syria and Jordan to surround Israel in a  "ring of steel" poised to pounce on the tiny nation. Could there be any greater  threat to Israel than that?  </P> <P> Mr. Kasem, when the flames of the fire begin to lick all around you, do you sit  there to absorb it all? One would think you would respond to it. That's just  the point. Israel responded -- to the acts of war initiated by Egypt.  </P> <P> JULIAN WHITE  </P> <P> President  </P> <P> Americans for a Safe Israel  </P> <P> Pacific Southwest Region  </P></p>

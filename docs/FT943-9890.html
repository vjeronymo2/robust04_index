			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / India's trade gap narrows India's exports grew 9.5 per cent to reach Dollars 5.6bn (Pounds 3.6bn) in the first three months of fiscal 1994-95, against Dollars 5.1bn in the corresponding period last year, the commerce ministry reports. Imports increased 7.5 per cent to Dollars 5.8 bn in the same period, against Dollars 5.4bn in April-June 1993. The country's trade balance for the three-month period registered a decline at Dollars 197.94m. Last year's trade deficit was Dollars 301.49m, the ministry added. Exports showed relatively low growth this year because of the erosion of India's competitive edge, reflecting a higher inflation rate than in the US, EU and Japan and growth in domestic demand. Textile and leather exports, which account for nearly 20 per cent of total exports, have been adversely affected by sluggish international demand and competition from other suppliers, mostly in the Far East. The export of engineering goods, which accounts for nearly 10 per cent of the total market, slowed because of a fall in demand for primary and semi-finished iron and steel products.</p>

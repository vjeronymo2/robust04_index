			<p><P> November 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CAPTIVATED BY CHINA  </P> <P> As a result of a brief note you published concerning bargain trips to China by  Inter Pacific Tours, we left Aug. 29 and spent two absolutely wonderful weeks  in China.  </P> <P> You mentioned a cost of $1,000, which seemed too good to be true. Inter Pacific  Tours did everything it promised. We traveled locally via public bus, taxi and  rickshaw. We loved China and the Chinese people and look forward to returning.  </P> <P> Thanks again for turning us on to a wonderful opportunity.  </P> <P> MURRAY LEVY and HESTER PALMQUIST, Pacific Palisades  </P></p>

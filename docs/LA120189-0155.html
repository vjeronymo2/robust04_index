			<p><P> December 1, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> NICARAGUA BARS CONGRESSMEN  </P> <P> The Sandinista government of Nicaragua refused to allow a four-member  congressional delegation to visit the country to observe national election  campaign activities, the lawmakers said today.  </P> <P> The delegation was rebuffed by Foreign Minister Miguel D'Escoto, who objected  to the financial aid Congress and the Administration have provided to  opposition candidate Violeta Chamorro.  </P> <P> "President Bush and the U.S. Congress cannot have it both ways. They cannot  attempt to buy the election of one candidate and then present themselves to us  as impartial election observers," D'Escoto said in a letter to Rep. G. V.  (Sonny) Montgomery (D-Miss.) and other members of the delegation.  </P></p>

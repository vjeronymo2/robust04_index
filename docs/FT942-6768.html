			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / New vroom for sporty icon: A look at the cultural revolution at a legendary Italian carmaker Ferrari is learning humility. Brought down to earth by a fall of almost 50 per cent in sales in the past two years, the carmaker has decided it has to listen to its customers. Ferrari sports cars may be modern icons, exhibited last year at the New York Museum of Modern Art and currently at Berlin's Neue Nationalgalerie, but the Italian carmaker has been having trouble finding customers during the past two years of global recession. The company is fighting back. It is unveiling an array of new products at almost indecent speed; the latest is the 183mph F355, on display at its Maranello headquarters in northern Italy this week. The 3.5-litre F355, which boasts five valves per cylinder and 380bhp, replaces the existing 348 and will be crucial to Ferrari's fortunes. It is to be launched around the world in the second half of this year. Priced in excess of Pounds 80,000, the F355 will be Ferrari's new 'entry-level' car, the lowest-priced in the range and set to account for about 60 per cent of its annual sales. While the engine roar of the F355s hurtling around Ferrari's Fiorano test-track this week under the guidance of former Formula One champion Niki Lauda and current driver Jean Alesi, may have been unmistakably Ferrari, the company's sales and marketing pitch is changing drastically. In the late 1980s and early 1990s there was a wave of speculative buying as auction values soared. 'There was big speculation, it was so easy to sell Ferraris,' says Mr Michele Scannavini, sales and marketing director. 'We had three to four years that were crazy, to the beginning of 1992. You just had to produce it and the car was sold.' In the second half of 1992, however, 'things changed dramatically', he says. 'Social and economic conditions changed. We have had a couple of very difficult years.' Sales dropped sharply, to 2,350 in 1993 from 4,400 in 1991. With stocks of unsold Ferraris growing, production was halted for 40 working days last year to bring inventories more into line with sales. Ferrari decided it had to become more user-friendly if it was to halt the decline. The arrival of Mr Scannavini at the beginning of last year from a career at Procter &amp; Gamble, the US consumer products group, and at BSN, France's largest food group, has marked the cultural revolution at the carmaker. 'There is a clear evolution in the Ferrari product,' he says. 'We decided to be much more attentive to what the customer says, wants and expects. We like to say we don't have a competitor, but we cannot be blind.' The change of heart - and the replacement of the 348 - has not come a moment too soon. The results of a recent comparative road test of the Ferrari 348, Honda's NSX and the Porsche 911 in Autocar, the British motoring weekly, carried the dire headline: 'NSX kills 348 shock.' Mr Scannavini may have come to Ferrari from a world of detergents, oral hygiene and household cleaning products, but he insists it was a sector that demanded close attention to both consumer needs and the marketplace. He stresses how the F355 has electronically controlled suspension settings, with a sport and comfort setting to even out the bumps. There is power steering, though the muscle-bound can still order the car with mechanical steering only. There is ABS (anti-lock braking), though the same unreconstructed Ferrari buyer can deactivate it at the flick of a switch. The gear change has been smoothed. The perfect polished metal gate and gear stick remain, but the new six-speed gearbox replaces the old dog-leg five-speed box. And, yes, the colour. Gone are the days when you could have a Ferrari in any colour as long as it was red - or maybe yellow. 'We've renewed our colour range,' says Mr Scannavini. The F355 comes with a range of 17 exterior and 12 interior colours. The F355 has also been designed to behave impeccably in town as well as on the race-track. Crucially, Ferrari has decided that annual sales and production will never again be allowed to exceed the ceiling of 3,000 a year to protect the exclusivity of the marque. Sales are also to be spread more thinly across more markets. Six markets are being opened in the Far East and four in Latin America. 'We saw what happened by selling too many at the end of the 1980s,' says Mr Scannavini. 'There were too many cars in the used car market.' He also wants to go back to the 'right' customers. 'When the Ferrari myth became strong, it was with the gentleman driver. In the period of speculation, too many Ferraris went into the wrong hands. Our customers do not want to be associated with Mafiosi, dealers and prostitutes.'</p>

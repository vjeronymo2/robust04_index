			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Half share in house My parents owned the house in which they lived as tenants in common. My father died recently and left me his half share. If the house is sold, will I be liable to CGT on my share? (I own and live in a house in another town). If I gave my share to my mother, would she have to pay gift tax? If I refused the inheritance, would it go automatically to my mother, thus avoiding any CGT if the house is sold later? What you might save in CGT could be more than lost in inheritance tax (on your mother's death) if you renounce your father's bequest. Your reference to 'gifts tax' indicates you do not understand the CGT and IHT systems - so do discuss things with the lawyer. Before the second anniversary of your father's death, you should give formal notice to your tax office (under section 222(5)(a) of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992) that your existing home is to be treated as your main residence, with effect from the day of your father's death. This notice will give you the chance eventually to elect for your parents' home to be treated as your main residence, and then to elect for your existing home to be treated as your main residence once again, with a week or so in between. Such judiciously-timed notices could bring you substantial (or complete) relief from CGT on your half share without producing an unacceptable CGT bill on selling your existing home. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

The central  government is moving to maintain the economic upturn which could  be jeopardized by runaway inflation.    Vice-premier and governor of the central bank Zhu Rongji  told  a national work conference last Saturday that the country must  stick to the tight money policy introduced last July.    However, runaway inflation caused by overheated growth, will  severely damage the work done so far. Moreover, high inflation  will also cause social distress and instability.    Some economists and politicians believe the government  should  keep economic growth this year at around 9 percent.    They say China should extend the time limit to achieve its  target.    Early in September last year, economists warned of the  consequences of loosened credit policies.    The central government had introduced measures to enhance  its  economic control, especially over credit, when the economy began  to overheat -- a problem characterized by chaos in banking and  double- digit inflation.    Although the trouble in the banking world, such as rampant  fund- raising and inter-bank lending, has largely been ironed  out in recent months, the monster of high inflation still looms  over the economy.    Zhu's speech at the weekend aimed to reinforce central  government moves to squeeze the money supply and halt price  hikes, which haunted the grain market at the end of last year,  triggering a buying spree in big cities.    State Price Information Centre said the cost-of-living index  in 35 large cities hit 23.5 percent last December compared with  the same month of the previous year.    One root cause of the increasing inflation was excessive  investment in fixed assets.    In the State sector in the second half of last year it grew  by around 65 percent compared with the same period the previous  year (see chart 1).    And from September, the banks began to take their feet off  the brakes on the money supply to meet State-owned enterprises'  increasing pleas for working capital.    Most State enterprises have to rely on bank loans and at  time  of economic retrenchment they must slow production almost to a  halt.    To keep the engines of State-owned enterprises working,  banks  increased their loans of working capital to industry to 68.9  billion yuan ($8 billion) between September and November last  year. The equivalent figure in 1992 was only 25.2 billion yuan  ($2.9 billion), said the State Statistics Bureau.    On this point, bankers say they would rather make loans to  governments to establish a social security system than to throw  money into propping up often-inefficient State enterprises.    Moves to bring annual urban inflation back under 15 percent,  5 percentage points lower than last year, will also depend on  support from regional governments, which have a much greater and  selfish desire to speed up their economies.    Some regions and departments are again blindly opening  investment projects, some of which violate State policies, said  a front-page commentary on Sunday in People's Daily [RENMIN  RIBAO], the leading newspaper of the country.    The newspaper called on regional governments to quell the  renewed real estate fever which is developing again in some  regions after a temporary lull.    In 1992, the huge amounts of money invested in real estate  were one of the chief factors that put the economy into the  frying pan.    It will be much easier to keep the economy growing at a  sustained pace, while fending off inflation, if regional  governments take more consideration of the country as a whole.</p>

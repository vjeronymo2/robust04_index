			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Arts: Today's Television In Omnibus: Korda II (BBC1, 10.30) the Hungarian director's doctor describes how, after Korda's divorce from his first wife, he received a letter of passionate abuse every day from her - and Korda always read it. Messe Solonnelle (BBC2, 9.30) allows us to hear an important musical find. In 1990, a church organist in Antwerp rediscovered the solemn mass written by Berlioz when he was 20. Two performances were well received but Berlioz's affections cooled. Tonight's live performance is a BBC2/Radio 3 link-up from Westminster Cathedral, a superb building. In its unemotional way the dugong or sea cow, is fascinating because it is the original mermaid. Wildlife Showcase: Pontas - Mermaid of the Sea (BBC2, 8.30) films a charming orphaned dugong in New Caledonia. Naively perhaps, I am still rather puzzled by the lengths people will go to appear on the box. Doing It With You  ..Is Taboo (C4, 11.00) is a studio discussion. Participants get down to basics - whether sex is better with a black or white partner.</p>

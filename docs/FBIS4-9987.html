			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "24 Hours" Newscast] </F>   [Text] A telephone espionage scandal involving the Santo  Domingo Group and SEMANA magazine sparked different reactions  today. Bavaria Brewery president Augusto Lopez Valencia spoke  from Cartagena:    [Begin recording] [Lopez] I am going to make a very brief  comment because last week Felipe Lopez sent me a publication  which carries a report about alleged telephone conversations.  This situation was totally clarified. Lopez said SEMANA  magazine, which I have yet to read because I was in meetings all  day, published a completely different report. Our lawyers are  studying the report and will issue a communique today or by  tomorrow morning at the latest.    [Unidentified reporter] What measures will the company take?    [Lopez] The company is studying the matter. It is a very  delicate issue [words indistinct].    [Reporter] Do you think there will be a [words indistinct]?    [Lopez] It is not what I believe, but I think the country  has  already witnessed this. [end recording]    The Santo Domingo Group sent a fax to the media a few  minutes  ago. The fax states: SEMANA magazine published a report that  illustrates the persecution to which the Santo Domingo Group has  been subjected for a long time and which has increased since we  received the contract to operate cellular telephones in the  northwestern and coastal regions, where the communications  [words indistinct]. SEMANA magazine reports that this scandal,  which involves Mario Santo Domingo himself, started when Beatriz  Davila, Mario Santo Domingo's wife, explained the dismissal of  her brother-in-law, Carlos Perez Norsa Garay, from the Avianca  board of directors. Maria del Pilar Ortiz filed a report.    [Begin Ortiz recording] The latest issue of SEMANA magazine  published a front-page report that went on for five pages  detailing an alleged espionage case. According to the magazine,  businessman Julio Mario Santo Domingo listened to the  conversations of Felipe Lopez, the magazine's president. This  is telephone espionage.    According to the report, Carlos Perez Norsa Garay was  dismissed from the board of directors of Avianca, which belongs  to the Santo Domingo Group, after 10 years as a member. Augusto  Lopez dismissed him unexpectedly. When Perez requested an  explanation, he talked to his sister-in-law, Beatriz Davila,  wife of Julio Mario Santo Domingo. The magazine reports that  she told him: I have some tapes containing a telephone  conversation where you told Felipe Lopez bad things about the  group. She also gave other details that she was not supposed to  know. According to Santo Domingo's wife, Felipe Lopez himself  taped the conversation, and Bavaria Brewery Company President  Augusto Lopez gave the tape to her husband. Augusto Lopez, in  turn, told the prosecutor general that Felipe Lopez had given  him nothing and that the recording did not exist; therefore, he  had never been able to take it to New York.    SEMANA magazine told Prosecutor General Gustavo De Greiff  about the case a week ago. Carlos Perez himself told the  president. The SEMANA article hints that someone is lying  because it seems that the recordings indeed exist. It is not  known who made them or how they were made. The article also  implies that if this telephone line was tapped, something  similar could be done with the telephone line of a minister or a  competitor in a bidding process. It is known that the Santo  Domingo Group will operate a large share of cellular phones in  the country. When the communications minister was asked about  the case, he said the one thing had nothing to do with the  other. Should it be proved the telephone taps did occur, there  would be a legal punishment that would not affect the  contracting process. [end recording]</p>

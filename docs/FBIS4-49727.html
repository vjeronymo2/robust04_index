			<p>BFN     [Text] Yingchuan, May 10 (XINHUA) -- The Ningxia Hui  Autonomous Region in China's northwest has built 228.7 km of  highways a year over the past 15 years, linking the entire  Muslim autonomous region with 12 trunk highways.    According to an official from the region's communications  department, Ningxia is now cobwebbed with 8,300 kilometers of  highways. The region's 292 towns and townships all have access  to modern highway transportation.    Meanwhile, the number of highway bridges has more than  doubled. Highways and bridges, particularly the three bridges  across the Yellow River, China's second largest, have greatly  eased Ningxia's transportation tension.    Better transportation has greatly enhanced Ningxia's market  circulation. The region's rich coal, farm and sideline products  have kept flowing towards the economically developed areas while  construction and industrial materials from other provinces have  helped modernize the region.    At present, seven large transportation projects are being  built with the help of the state. The 1200-meter bridge in the  region's capital of Yingchuan, the most up-to-date bridge across  the Yellow River, is expected to be put into operation next  month.    Other projects include the construction of a first class  highway from Yingchuan to Guyaozi and the renovation of the  second class highway from Yingchuan to Pingliang. The effort is  expected to bring the total length of highways to 9,700  kilometers in six to seven years.</p>

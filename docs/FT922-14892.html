			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Sony Music will run Milton Keynes Bowl SONY MUSIC Entertainment, the Japanese-owned recorded music company, is to take over the running of the Milton Keynes Bowl, the open-air concert venue, in a deal thought to be worth Pounds 9m. The Bowl, which has hosted concerts by Queen, Michael Jackson, David Bowie and U2, was previously run by the Milton Keynes Development Corporation, which was wound up on Tuesday. The venue, which was opened in 1979, will be run by a joint venture of Sony Music and Pace Entertainment, which operates amphitheatres and arts centres in the US. Sony said it had been granted a five-year lease over the Milton Keynes Bowl, but it hoped to extend that to 25 years. Sony Music's UK and US arms will each own a third of the joint venture, with Pace holding the remaining third. Sony expects to stage seven concerts every year at the Bowl, which holds up to 60,000 spectators on grassy banks and standing areas. It will also host community-related events. Sony Music said yesterday that it would donate 25p from each ticket sold at the Bowl to Milton Keynes' community trust. It will also give a Pounds 5,000 annual scholarship to a local resident to study event management in the US. Sony Music was formerly CBS Records. It was acquired in 1988 by Sony, the Japanese electronics company. Its artists include Bruce Springsteen, George Michael, Neil Diamond and Bob Dylan. Sony and Pace jointly run two American entertainment venues. The Milton Keynes Bowl is their first venture outside the US.</p>

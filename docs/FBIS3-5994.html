			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "A Sad Day for Burmese Democracy Movement and </F> Its People"]    [Excerpts] The United Nations in Geneva last week accused  Burma's military government of persistent and extremely serious  human rights violations, including torture and summary  execution. [passage omitted]    But that's UN business. Apparently it is of no concern to  ASEAN. ASEAN's main fixation with the illegitimate pariah regime  in Rangoon is the abundance of wealth it is sitting on, and how  to exploit those riches. How the Burmese generals run their  country is their own "internal affair".    So after months of debate and soul-searching, ASEAN,  comprising Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, the  Philippines and Brunei, has decided to invite Burma, for that  country's well-being and as well as theirs, to attend its annual  pow-wow in Bangkok in July as guest of the host nation.    We wonder though if the remaining five member nations would  have done the same had one of them been the host of this year's  meeting and thereby risked criticism by most Western governments  which shun the brutal military regime in Rangoon. [passage  omitted]    Another question is why Thailand, why this government, a  democratically elected one, chose to ignore the exhortations of  the media, its academics and most in the intellectual community  to scrap its controversial "constructive engagement" policy with  a regime hated by its people for its ruthless and arbitrary  rule? As a democratic government it owes its allegiance first  to its people. Not to a certain group of people with vested  interests, and certainly not to a foreign government and a  dictatorial one at that. This Government came into being after a  bloody uprising less than two years ago in exchange for human  lives and an end to military dictatorship. Yet today we are  consorting with a regime and shaking a hand which is soaked with  the blood of more than 3,000 of its own people who were killed  in the 1988 suppression.    This Government justifies its association with the Burmese  generals saying there can be no political development until  economic stability has been restored to that country. And  without economic stability there could be no security in Burma  and Southeast Asia as a whole. To achieve this aim, its policy  and those of its ASEAN counterparts is not to isolate Burma,  instead to embrace it with open arms into the ASEAN fold with  the hope of coaxing it into establishing democratic rule.    We believe this is a pipe dream on the part of ASEAN where  the Burmese military government is concerned. Because without  political stability there can be no economic stability, and  therefore no security. They go hand in hand. Thailand should  know that best. Like a leopard that never changes its spots, so  are the rulers of Rangoon who call themselves the State Law and  Restoration Council [SLORC]. It is convinced that might is  right and the military is the government, and not the people.  But not so to the 42 million Burmese who were robbed of a  democratically-elected government in the May 1990 election.    If ASEAN, and Thailand in particular, really aspires to see  a  secure Southeast Asia, it should tell Maj. Gen. Khin Nyunt and  his cronies to return what they have robbed from the Burmese  people. Tell them the days of military dictatorship are over.  As the former premier of the once military-ruled Thailand in  1991 said "Military might alone is no longer an adequate  guarantee of national security.... No nation can feel secure as  long as its citizens are deprived of the freedom of political  expression and of the opportunities for a better and more  meaningful life." [passage omitted]    ASEAN's invitation to SLORC is a disgrace. It will impact  negatively on the Burmese democracy movement and Burma's  oppressed populace.</p>

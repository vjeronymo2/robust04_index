			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Spanish Interior Minister Antonio Asuncion </F> by Isabel San Sebastian in Madrid; date not given]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [San Sebastian] Following  the latest killing perpetrated in Barcelona, to what can the  failures in the previous attempts be attributed? To chance and  luck or to the weakness and disorganization of what is left of  the gang [Basque Homeland and Liberty -- ETA]?    [Asuncion] I have my own opinions, and there are opinions to  suit all tastes. The important thing is that they failed in  those attacks.    [San Sebastian] It is also important to know why...    [Asuncion] I believe that they are not very familiar with  the explosives which they are using, but you will forgive me for  not entering into technical explanations.    [San Sebastian] You stated on your arrival at the ministry  that you considered the contacts with ETA closed. If the  "Azkoiti way" was, as was said from this ministry, a police way  of finding out what was happening inside the gang and creating  splits, why was it abandoned?    [Asuncion] I have recognized no legacy of contacts with ETA  from Algiers. As far as Azkoiti is concerned, he is an ETA  member who served his sentence in France and who, according to  my information, is in favor of renouncing violence, like many  other prisoners, and is trying to persuade the armed gang to  renounce violence. But that is no police way; it is the same  thing that is happening with groups such as Elkarri, which  belongs to the Herri Batasuna [People's Unity Party] milieu, and  which is beginning to say that violence is not the way.    [San Sebastian] I will put it to you another way. Since  your arrival at the ministry, has this ministry any way of  knowing what is happening inside ETA?    [Asuncion] This ministry knows what may be happening within  a gang of mafiosi, drug traffickers, or criminals through  informers, about whom, as is natural, I will not say a word.    [San Sebastian] If French justice has now granted the  extradition of Azkoiti, who was the leader of the roving  commando, and this man no longer counts for anything, why is he  living peacefully in an apartment in Paris?    [Asuncion] I do not know; it is certainly a matter which I  will have to check.    [San Sebastian] Of course. Did the Basque Socialist Party  [PSE] leaders discuss their initiative of beginning contacts  with Herri Batasuna?    [Asuncion] No, of course not, but in any event these are  measures which the PSE must discuss within itself. For its  part, the government must carry out its election program.    [San Sebastian] I find it very hard to believe that the PSE  would embark upon such a venture without the blessing of Ferraz  Street [Socialist Party headquarters]...    [Asuncion] They have embarked upon nothing. They have  announced that there is a number of ideas worth studying.    [San Sebastian] Were you acquainted with that plan?    [Asuncion] I became acquainted with it later.    [San Sebastian] And what was your opinion?    [Asuncion] That the government must stand by what was agreed  at the Ajuria Enea palace, and that hence that is where that  plan must be discussed.  <H5>  Prisoners, Pardons </H5>   [San Sebastian] Honestly and, if possible, with a date, for  how long will the prisoners be negotiable, and for how long will  you keep the doors of rehabilitation open?    [Asuncion] They have not been or ever can be negotiable.  With respect to serving sentences in full, this will be possible  when the current legislation is changed. The Spanish Socialist  Workers Party has that proposal in its election program, and now  we must wait for parliament to decide -- in March, I believe --  on the new penal code.    [San Sebastian] Are you personally in favor of this?    [Asuncion] I, of course, must carry out my party's programs.  [passage omitted]</p>

Gao Dezhan stressed: At present,  leaders at all levels in Tianjin and the suburban counties, and  relevant departments should find out problems in spring farming,  formulate measures, go to the grass roots to render service and  do practical things, and guarantee a steady increase in summer  grain and the annual agricultural production.    Gao Dezhan and Zheng Zhiying, member of the standing  committee of the municipal party committee and secretary  general, made use of the time on Sunday to inspect Gangtian  Motorcycle Company-- a village- run enterprise in Haihewan  Village in Shuanggang Town--with simple means of transportation  and few people in their company. They highly praised Gong  Shiquan, chief manager of this company, for his outstanding  achievements in successfully running a plant to make the village  prosperous, and urged him not to forget agriculture while  grasping industry, and made redoubled efforts to grasp the  project related to grain and vegetable production. Gao Dezhan  and other leaders also travelled to the families of Zhao Yonglin  and his brother--two crops cultivation households in Shuanggang  Village--to ask them about the cultivation situation, marketing,  and income in cultivating vegetables under plastic sheets.  After that, they visited an exclusively foreign-funded  enterprise-- Bokelai Daily Necessary Company, Limited--and  Nanyanxiang Jingjing Decorating Lamps Company, Limited.  Braving the sudden cold spell in spring, Gao Dezhan also  travelled to Datianli of Beizhongtang Village in Shuangya  Township to inspect its preparations for plowing. He learned  from the village cadres about the situation of plowing,  irrigation, and the storage of seeds and chemical fertilizers,  and asked in details about the income, living, and farming  enthusiasm of peasants.    During a forum with district and township cadres, Gao Dezhan  pointed out: This year we should act in line with the demand of  the party Central Committee and the State Council on further  strengthening agricultural and rural work, comprehensively  develop the rural economy, and strive to increase the income of  peasants. He put forward four specific demands: 1) Pay  Attention to stabilizing and increasing the output of grain,  cotton and oil- bearing crops, actively develop the nonstaple  food project, actively readjust the agricultural structure,  including the planting and breeding industries, and develop  high-yield, fine-quality, and highly efficient farming. This  year the increase in the total agricultural output value should  be higher than that of last year and must not be lower than the  national average level of increase. 2) Actively develop township  enterprises, accelerate the development of tertiary industry and  of individual and private enterprises, develop diversified  undertakings, comprehensively invigorate the rural economy, and  ensure that the increase in the total product of the rural  society will not be lower than that of last year. 3) Further  strengthen the building of spiritual civilization in the rural  areas, accelerate the building of well-off star villages, do a  good job in comprehensive management of public security, and  turn more townships and villages into civilized, prosperous,  and stable new rural areas. 4) Try by all possible means to  increase the income of peasants, raise their living standards,  and through economic development, strive to increase the  financial revenue of suburban counties, and strengthen the  momentum for developing township enterprises.    Gao Dezhan pointed out: To implement all tasks in the rural  areas, leading cadres at all levels should further enhance their  ideology and understanding and fully recognize the foundation  status of agriculture; firmly cultivate the idea that when the  rural areas are stable, all sectors will be stable and when the  rural areas are prosperous, Tianjin will also become prosperous.  We should pay great attention to rural work and agricultural  production, and promote comprehensive rural economic development  and social progress.    Gao Dezhan stressed: A year's plan will start in spring. At  present, it is time for making plowing preparations. We must  seize this opportunity and concentrate energy on making  preparations for plowing. He said: At present, there are many  difficulties lying ahead in agricultural production, the drought  situation is serious, the prices of some agricultural means of  production have been raised, and leading comrades of some  localities have failed to pay full attention to agricultural  production. Leaders at all levels must recognize the grim  situation in agricultural production and pay great attention to  it. March is a period of crucial importance for our  municipality to make preparations for plowing. Districts and  counties charged with agricultural production tasks must urge  their cadres at all levels, from the party committee to the  government, to take action to combat drought to protect the  seedings of winter crops, to reap a bumper harvest of summer  grains, to strive to achieve good harvests during the whole  year, and to achieve highly efficient and good-quality  production of nonstaple foods, such as cotton and oil-bearing  crops. It is necessary to grasp all spring plowing tasks,  including the preparations for seeds, chemical fertilizers, and  agricultural chemicals, popularization of science and  technology, and technical guidance. Meanwhile, we should conduct  in-depth and meticulous ideological and political work among  peasants and mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses of  peasants in spring plowing. All localities should assign the  responsibility to all levels and make all levels and the  peasant households to assume responsibility over each plot of  land. Gao Dezhan stressed: Relevant departments in Tianjin and  in suburban counties and leaders at all levels should further  change work style, and should not be content with a general  call. They should find out problems in spring plowing,  formulate measures, go to the grass roots, render service, do  practical things, and ensure that this year's agricultural  production and rural economic development objectives will be  fulfilled.    Gao Dezhan encouraged the masses of cadres in Jinnan  District  to fully use their own advantages and favorable conditions,  advance in a pioneering spirit, and invigorate Jinnan.</p>

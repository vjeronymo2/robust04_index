			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Nordic insurance The eternal triangle of Nordic insurers - Hafnia, Skandia and Uni Storebrand  -may become something of a magnet for overseas capital. Bidding for Denmark's Hafnia closed on Friday, with the likes of AGF of France and Denmark's Codan, controlled by Sun Alliance, still in the hunt. Uni Storebrand's administrators must soon come forward with a plan to recapitalise that business. Most of the funding is likely to come from Norwegian institutions. But any auction of its 28 per cent stake in Skandia should attract an international crowd. Skandia itself has so far been happy to shrink its business in line with its capital base. So its solvency ratio remains adequate despite the 20 per cent decline in net asset value announced last week. If Swedish property values continue to fall, though, fresh capital may be required. With more than 40 per cent of its shares in the hands of Hafnia and Uni Storebrand's administrators, a rights issue looks difficult. An overseas partnership which might take over these stakes must be an attractive option. But a flow of foreign capital to the region could slow the return to profitability by raising capacity too quickly. Nordic insurers are no different from any others in that the most reliable source of capital is retained profits.</p>

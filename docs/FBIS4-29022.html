			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 14 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam  conferred with former U.S. President Jimmy Carter at Chongwadae  [presidential offices] Tuesday evening on ways to resolve the  North Korean nuclear question.    Carter is set to visit Pyongyang Wednesday morning through  Panmunjom to discuss the nuclear issue with the North Korean  leadership.    During the talks over dinner that lasted two and half an  hours, President Kim pointed out that the nuclear question has  arrived at a critical stage because of Pyongyang's announced  withdrawal from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).    A source said the president explained to Carter about the  Seoul government's firm stance toward the nuclear situation.    President Kim reiterated that North Korea's nuclear  development should be thwarted by all means and that if  Pyongyang presses ahead with nuclear development, sanctions  through the United Nations would be unavoidable, he said.    The source said that President Kim asked the former U.S.  President to convey Seoul's concern and position with regard to  North Korea's announced withdrawal from the IAEA, and to  successfully persuade the North Koreans to respond affirmatively  to international demands.    Former President Carter was learned to have explained about  the purpose of his visit to Pyongyang and promised to relay  Seoul's position to Pyongyang correctly.    After the meeting, Chongwadae spokesman Chu Ton-sik said the  meeting was held in an amicable atmosphere, adding, however,  that Kim and Carter decided not to disclose the contents of  their talks.    According to Chu, Carter said he would not discuss his  mission prior to his visit to Pyongyang, but would explain about  the feelings he would have during his talks with North Korean  leaders when he returns to Seoul from the North.    On Wednesday morning, Carter would meet Deputy Prime  Minister  Yi Hong-ku before leaving for Pyongyang via Panmunjom.    He would return to Seoul Saturday morning and meet with  President Kim.</p>

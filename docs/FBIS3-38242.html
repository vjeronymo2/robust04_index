The Austrian border authority at the Wullovitz crossing  found  the three soldiers to be in possession of six hand grenades and  one pistol. The soldiers are thought to have brought the  weapons back as mementos of their service in ex-Yugoslavia, APA  writes.    The unit's two transport buses, which had been searched by  the border guard, were given customs clearance earlier this  evening and the 67 remaining troops continued their journey into  the Czech Republic, where customs clearance preceded without  problems.    The three members of the Czech UNPROFOR unit suspected of  small arms smuggling and detained for further questioning this  evening, were handed to the Foreign Police Office at Dolni  Dvoriste at 2200, Jan Bruzek from the office told CTK.    According to Vienna observers, the police action was well  prepared in advance which is also proved by the fact that  cameramen from Austrian Television arrived immediately on the  spot.    The Austrian police have refused to tell CTK were the  suspicion of arms smuggling by Czech soldiers had originated.    All the 70 soldiers were travelling home for a regular  leave.</p>

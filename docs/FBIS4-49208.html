			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Geoffrey Crothall in Beijing] </F>   [Text] China appears to have quietly shelved its  controversial law on eugenics after encountering criticism from  both within its own government and abroad.    The draft legislation, first submitted to the National  People's Congress (NPC) last December, will not be on the agenda  of this week's NPC Standing Committee meeting and is unlikely to  be discussed at the following session, a spokesman said  yesterday.    NPC spokesman Shen Zhangrong said the law could now only be  discussed when a vacancy appeared in the NPC's busy schedule.  He declined to say if a vacancy might appear this year or not.    The proposed law provoked outrage in many western countries  because it appeared to advocate the forced sterilisation of  mentally or physically handicapped women. The Ministry of  Public Health denied any intention to force anyone to undergo  sterilisation or have an abortion but the original draft was  subsequently revised to make it appear less contentious.    The revised law, now entitled "the law on the protection of  the health of mothers and infants", omits all mention of  "inferior births" and "eugenics" and emphasises the positive  rather than negative aspects of the programme. However, it is  understood the revised draft is still not ready for submission  to the NPC because of continued opposition from the State Family  Planning Commission.    The commission has been critical of the proposed law in case  it damages China's international reputation. The commission was  also concerned the new law would create an additional workload  without providing additional resources.    Despite the failure to enact the legislation, eugenics  continues to be practised as a matter of course by local  governments throughout China, particularly in the poorer  provinces, such as Gansu, which do not have the resources to  cope with the mentally and physically handicapped. Gansu  introduced its eugenics law in 1989 and local family planning  officials sterilised more than 1,000 "congenitally retarded"  people with an IQ of less than 49 in the first year of the law's  operation.    Analysts said the failure to pass the legislation might lead  to greater problems for the mentally and physically handicapped  in China. Leaving eugenics work up to ill-trained and  unsympathetic local officials rather than codifying it in a  national law would be of no benefit to those affected they said.  "Its ironic that this legislation, which caused such a stink in  the west, could have actually improved conditions for many  mentally handicapped people in China," a Chinese population  expert said.</p>

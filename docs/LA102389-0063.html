			<p><P> October 23, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEWS;  </P> <P> RECENT MCGURTY WORKS AT SANTA MONICA  </P> <P> In his prefatory remarks to a concert of music by Mark McGurty on Friday, the  venerable lexicographer Nicolas Slonimsky stated flatly that no music  dictionary, not even his own, could adequately describe McGurty's music. He's  probably right. But the six works by the 34-year-old Los Angeles composer heard  at the Santa Monica Museum of Art did leave some strong impressions.  </P> <P> The premiere of McGurty's attractive Fantasy for flute and piano revealed a  melodic technique used, more or less, in most of his music. The flute line  consists of small sets of notes, not necessarily close in range, rapidly and  randomly repeated and then added to and melded with another set. The first set  is left behind and the process continues. This technique has a way of centering  a musical line, and in the case of the Fantasy gave the flute part, skillfully  played by Susan Pezzone, a modal, rhapsodic, almost improvisatory quality.  </P> <P> In his arresting "Anatole Cycle," a setting of 205 fragments by Mallarme on the  death of the son of the poet, McGurty deliberately limited his means for  dramatic effect. The baritone sings long, sustained, emotive lines over a  narrow range, the speaker delivers understated, though pained, monologue, and  the piano provides jagged, kaleidoscopic commentary, framing and creating the  emotional context. A sigh of relief from someone in the audience was heard at  its conclusion. Baritone Edward Levy, pianist Vicki Ray and speaker Anne Marie  Ketchum gave it a convincing reading.  </P> <P> Both of the complex, gnarled piano sonatas (1985 and 1989) build frenetic  momentum through quickening of activity, thickening of texture and thundering  dynamics. Bryan Pezzone was the virtuosic, aggressive soloist in both.  </P> <P> Also heard, the thorny "Anniversary Album" for solo violin, faithfully  dispatched by Cynthia McGurty, and Four Songs, a gently swaying, spacey setting  of Paul Eluard poems, ably performed by soprano Deborah Mayhan and pianist  Vicki Ray.

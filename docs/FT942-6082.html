			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / International Company News: Japan's leading airlines held back by high costs Japan's two leading airlines yesterday announced heavy losses for the year to March, as they battled with high costs in markets increasingly open to lower-cost competition. However, the results from Japan Air Lines (JAL) did offer some hope as the airline cut its net loss to Y25.3bn (Dollars 243m) from last year's Y43.7bn, on sales which slipped to Y982.3bn from Y1,033.9bn. Pre-tax losses fell to Y26.1bn from Y53.8bn. JAL forecast a modest pre-tax profit of Y1bn for this year. All Nippon Airways (ANA) fell into a net loss of Y2.9bn from a profit of Y2.4bn last year, on sales down to Y774.8bn from Y808.4bn. At the pre-tax level, the profit slipped to Y2.8bn from Y15.8bn. The airline expects to break even this year. Both carriers continued to experience weak demand, particularly in the first half. 'International business travel demand was low, and there was a marked swing to lower fares,' JAL said. The fall in demand, as cost-conscious passengers turn to lower fare airlines and discounted tickets, demonstrates the big effort JAL and ANA need to put into reducing their high-cost structures. Japan's airlines face restrictions by the transport ministry which must approve fare changes and it imposes stringent regulations which add to their cost base. For JAL, cost-cutting in the parent company is almost impossible because of union resistance. The airline plans to reduce its workforce by more than 4,000 people in four years, has expanded its voluntary retirement scheme, and has launched a frequent-flyer programme and lower-fare routes. It is shifting a greater proportion of costs outside Japan. Some maintenance is being moved to China, and the company is hiring more than 800 Thai flight attendants over the next four years and more than 200 non-Japanese pilots. JAL is introducing a tourist flight to Hawaii. This is one of the most popular destinations of Japanese travellers but it must compete with low-cost US carriers. ANA, meanwhile, plans to cut its workforce by 10 per cent in the next two years, and it has suspended some unprofitable routes. Japanese carmakers and pulp and paper companies, Page 32</p>

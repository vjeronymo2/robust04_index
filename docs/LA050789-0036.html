			<p><P> May 7, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHENEY ON GORBACHEV  </P> <P> Cheney's prediction of Gorbachev's demise was obviously meant to rationalize  further spending on Star Wars and other defense programs we can no longer  afford, and no longer need. But his remarks came off as both arrogant and  incredibly funny, considering that reforms in the Soviet Union stand a much  better chance than reforms of the Pentagon and the defense establishment.  </P> <P> I predict that Cheney will be unable to reform the hopelessly corrupt and  cumbersome procurement process, and will be overthrown by the defense  contractors.  </P> <P> JOEL FOSS  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / Swiss cultures clash over request to join Community: The decision, says Ian Rodger, has aroused both joy and suspicion THE SWISS government's decision this week to make an early application to enter the European Community may turn out to be a case where Swiss French logic crumbles before Swiss German stubbornness. Reaction to the decision has certainly been very different in the country's two main linguistic communities. In French-speaking Romandy, which has long had a cosmopolitan culture, there was near-unalloyed joy; in the more inward-looking German-speaking cantons suspicion prevailed. Neue Zurcher Zeitung, Zurich's leading newspaper, relegated the news to page 21 and grumbled about the 'undignified' way it leaked out. Even strong advocates of joining the EC worried that the move was premature and risked undermining public support for two other Europe-related plans which are to be put to plebiscites later this year. Most Swiss business leaders believe that their country must have closer ties with the EC if the country's economy is to thrive, but they suspect that the only way to convince the independent-minded German-speaking majority is by proceeding very gradually. That had also been the strategy until last October of the federal government. With the governments of the other six member states of the European Free Trade Association (Efta), Bern was negotiating a trade agreement with the EC to create a European Economic Area (EEA). Even that would be tough enough for many Swiss to accept. The idea was that the Efta countries would take on the four freedoms of the EC's single market, meaning Switzerland would open its doors to EC workers and home buyers and remove several mechanisms that protected professionals and many businesses from EC competitors. If all that was accepted and implemented, there would be plenty of time to try to cajole the Swiss into joining the EC itself. And even if they ultimately decided not to join, the Swiss economy would already be getting virtually all the benefits of membership. But in October, the government announced that joining the EC was official policy and that the EEA should be considered only a step towards it. From there, it was, as Swiss President Rene Felber said yesterday, only logical to actually send in an application. Coming when the country is approaching two plebiscites on the EEA treaty, this decision had the appearance of an attempt to get a Euro-bandwagon going. In September, a referendum is to be held on a proposal to spend SFr30bn (Pounds 11.1bn) to dig two new rail tunnels through the Alps. This is part of the EEA agreement intended to resolve the long-running dispute over transit rights through Switzerland and Austria for EC lorries, and it was always going to face strong opposition from both environmentalists and people worried about the cost. Then, probably in December, the referendum on the EEA treaty itself will be held. Both a majority of the population and a majority of the 26 cantons must approve the proposals. Most cantons are German-speaking and their lingering suspicion of international organisations was shown on Sunday when they approved by only the slimmest of margins a proposal to join the International Monetary Fund. The IMF would not directly hurt any Swiss. The EEA, on the other hand, would cause considerable upheaval, especially among the small and medium-sized businesses that are the core of the Swiss German economy. As Mr Pierre Borgeaud, president of the national business association, Vorort, pointed out, 'the feeling of being threatened is most strongly felt in eastern (German-speaking) Switzerland'.</p>

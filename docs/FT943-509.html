			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / Russia and US reach N-accord: Summit fails to resolve rift on Bosnia The US and Russia agreed yesterday to speed up the dismantling of their nuclear arsenals and reached a 'conceptual agreement' on ending Russia's controversial arms sales to Iran. After a two-day summit in Washington President Bill Clinton and President Boris Yeltsin said they had agreed to implement the nuclear cuts agreed in the Start 2 missile reduction treaty as soon as the pact was ratified by the two countries. The Start 2 treaty, signed by Mr Yeltsin and former President George Bush in January 1993, provides for the elimination of 15,000 of the 21,000 nuclear warheads in the two countries' arsenals, but allows them until the end of 2002 to complete the task. 'By doing it right away we can save at least seven and perhaps more years,' Mr Yeltsin said at a White House press conference after the summit ended. Mr Yeltsin said he had also agreed with Mr Clinton on a deal that would bring an end to Russian sales of military equipment to Iran and allow Russia to become part of the successor regime to the Cocom system which regulated arms exports from the west during the cold war. An existing contract signed in 1988 would be honoured, Mr Yeltsin said, but thereafter no new contracts would be signed and no new weapons would be supplied. 'That is the principle on which Bill Clinton agreed to let us participate in the post-Cocom regime,' Mr Yeltsin said. Mr Clinton hurriedly noted he had reached only 'conceptual agreement' with his Russian counterpart. 'We have to work through the details.' The US and Russia remained at odds over whether to lift the embargo on arms deliveries to Bosnia, even though the Bosnian government's request for a delay has at least put the issue on ice. Mr Yeltsin yesterday repeated his opposition to lifting the embargo.</p>

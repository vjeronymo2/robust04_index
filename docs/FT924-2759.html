			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / The Edinburgh Summit: Schluter pledge on deal for Denmark MR Poul Schluter left for Edinburgh yesterday pledging that he would not be the Danish prime minister to lead Denmark out of the Community. 'We will do our utmost to secure a deal in Scotland which will meet all the Danish requirements,' he said. However, the seven parties who have agreed a common stance on on Denmark's requirements refused to give the government a mandate to negotiate on the basis of proposals put forward by Britain for resolving the impasse. Any deal based on the British proposals would be rejected by the left-wing Socialist People's Party. Other parties have expressed qualified approval. It will be up to Mr Schluter and his foreign minister, Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, to decide whether to conclude a deal with the other 11 heads of government. If the deal is subsequently rejected by other parties, the government will have to fight the issue out in parliament, and if defeated would probably call an election.</p>

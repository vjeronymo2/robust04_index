			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Litho Supplies gets Pounds 50m tag with 190p issue price A PRICE of 190p a share was fixed yesterday for the flotation of Litho Supplies valuing the company, which claims to be the UK's largest independent distributor of printing products, at Pounds 50.2m. Litho, a Pounds 20.7m management buy-out from Pembridge Investments of DRG's Litho supplies business in 1990, is coming to the market by way of a placing and intermediaries offer which will raise Pounds 14.2m net of expenses. The company supplies products ranging from high-technology electronic equipment to conventional consumables to about 10,000 small and medium-sized companies. About 14m shares are being placed with institutions, with up to 6.18m subject to clawback for the intermediaries offer. The funds will redeem Pounds 7.3m in preference shares and repay Pounds 4m in mezzanine debt. The balance will reduce other borrowings of Pounds 5.5m in secured-term loans. On forecast pro forma pre-tax profits of Pounds 5.17m (Pounds 3.4m) for the year to end-December, the issue price gives a pro forma p/e of 14.6 times. 'This is a reasonable price for someone who wants to come into the printing sector. If you look at other prices in the sector such as St Ives, for example, we are coming in at not an unreasonable price,' said Mr John Byford, joint managing director. The total dividend of 6.5p the directors would have recommended for the full year would have given a gross yield of 4.28 per cent. The dividend would have been 2 times covered by earnings per share of 12.97p. A final dividend of 0.7p will be paid for the period to end-December from date of listing. In future Litho intends to pay interim and finals approximately in the proportion of 40 per cent: 60 per cent. The intermediaries offer closes on November 16 and it is expected that dealings will start on November 22. COMMENT Litho likes to compare itself with the giants of the printing industry which would make its rating cheap. True, the new flexible, computer-led technology on which Litho is pinning its hopes of growth is likely to find favour with the kinds of small businesses which already patronise the company and in which the large manufacturers have little interest. However, with the new market crowded with computer suppliers Litho will depend more than ever on its established trading relationships.</p>

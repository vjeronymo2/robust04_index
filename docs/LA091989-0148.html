			<p><P> September 19, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> BREWERY SEEKS SALE TO EASE DEBT  </P> <P> Australian brewing and investment magnate Alan Bond sought respite today from  his huge debt load with a multibillion-dollar deal to sell half his brewing  business to New Zealand's Lion Nathan.  </P> <P> But financial analysts were skeptical whether the deal would succeed after  earlier debt-relief plans from Bond have failed. "If it goes ahead, it may buy  Bond breathing space," said broker Nestor Hinzack of Burdett Buckeridge and  Young in Sydney. "But that is a big 'if.' "  </P> <P> An elaborate chain of takeovers, acquisitions and approvals from stock market  watchdogs and shareholders will be required before the deal is done.  </P> <P> Under the proposal, Perth-based Bond Corp. will sell its Australian breweries  to a new venture company for $1.9 billion. Lion Nathan and Bond would end up  with equal shares of the new company, Australian Breweries.  </P></p>

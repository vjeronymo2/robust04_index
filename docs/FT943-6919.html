			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / World Trade News: US business undeterred by Mexican unrest - Rebellion and kidnapping south of border have failed to dispel optimism over Nafta Rebellion, assassination and kidnapping south of the border have failed to depress the optimism among US businesses engendered by the North American Free Trade Agreement. A survey in May by KPMG Peat Marwick, the US business advisory company, found that while 97 per cent of senior corporate executives interviewed were aware of political unrest in Mexico, 87 per cent said it would not influence their companies' plans to conduct business there. More than a quarter said they had set up, or planned to pursue, a joint venture or strategic alliance with a Mexican company. US Commerce Department officials are also unperturbed by the turbulence. The energetic trade team working under Mr Ron Brown, commerce secretary, views the integration of the North American economy under Nafta as both unstoppable and a step towards economic integration of the hemisphere. 'There's no walking out on Nafta,' says Mr Jeffrey Garten, undersecretary for international trade and the leading voice on the commerce trade team. 'This has to work. The implications of failure are dire for US trade policy in general and the implications of a clear success are extremely positive.' The growth in foreign direct investment, which doubled in the last decade among the Nafta countries, has been slower than expected. But US officials see the run-up to the Mexican election as 'a pause', with the pace now expected to accelerate. The US trade surplus with Mexico, which narrowed last year, has begun to make a comeback. In the first six months of the year US exports shot up by 17 per cent to Dollars 24.5bn and government economists believe the Mexican recovery will lift the trade surplus to at least Dollars 2.1bn in 1994, up from Dollars 1.6bn last year. 'Some firms are responding through increased production and new investments in their home markets while, for others, inter-firm agreements and strategic alliances at the transnational level will generate a new regional dynamism,' Mr Garten said. Despite Mexico's economic and social woes, restructuring and expansion continue: Motorola and Mexico's Protexa are creating a Dollars 6bn telecommunications company to serve long-distance and cellular customers in Mexico. John Labatt, Canada's second largest beer company, and Femsa Cerveza, Mexico's largest brewer, are merging their US units and marketing each other's brands. John Labatt will acquire a 22 per cent stake in its partner and a three-year option to buy another 8 per cent. GTE of the US added Telmex, Mexico's telephone monopoly, to an already existing partnership with Skytel Communications of Canada. The move will expand GTE's air-to-ground telephone network to serve air passengers calling business centres throughout North America. Pilgrim's Pride, the fifth largest chicken producer in the US and second largest in Mexico, has announced a 40 per cent expansion of its Mexico operations. Along with corporate changes there has been a continental restructuring of transport flows. Mr Garten sees the emergence of north-south trade corridors developing among all three Nafta countries. Trade flows in the developing eastern corridor are expected to increase at an annual rate of 5-7 per cent to 1997. Western traffic is expected to rise by 16-24 per cent over the next 10 years. To liberalise trade further, the Nafta partners have established about 25 working groups charged with addressing problems left over from negotiations. One group is identifying products for accelerated tariff reduction while another is handling the issue of mutual recognition of professional licences. The Nafta partners would then move on to harmonisation of legal systems and policies on regulation, competition, taxes and exchange rates. As far as labour is concerned, US unions, which conducted a full-scale battle against Nafta, are no more enamoured with the pact than before. According to the AFL-CIO, the umbrella organisation for US labour unions, 180 US companies have already made applications to states for assistance on Nafta-related job losses. About 135 have been adjudicated and 62 companies with 5,200 workers have been accepted as casualties of Nafta and thus eligible for governmental assistance such as job retraining. Meanwhile, the National Administrative Office (NAO) in the US Labour Department has been set up to receive complaints by US unions about US companies mistreating their Mexican workers. Three complaints have been lodged - against General Electric, Honeywell and Sony. However, Mr Greg Woodhead, chief economist on the AFL-CIO's trade task force, said the NAO was understaffed and underfunded. A permanent director was only recently appointed and seven months elapsed before the NAO announced public hearings on the complaints it has received. It is still unclear whether the administration is prepared to challenge businesses which mistreat their Mexican workers, but a strong labour movement would be more likely than a dozen bands of Zapatista rebels to turn US companies off Mexico as a land of investment opportunity.</p>

[22 March] -- Malaysia will  consider sending additional soldiers to join the United Nations  Protection Force (Unprofor) in Bosnia-Herzegovina if requested  to do so by the UN, Armed Forces chief Jen [General] Tan Sri  Borhan Ahmad said today.    However, he said, there had been no proposal yet to despatch  extra peacekeepers to the war-ravaged country.    So far, Malaysia's contribution in Unprofor was sufficient  alongside the participation of soldiers from several other  countries, he added.    He told this to reporters after launching the 13th Air  Thamal  (Thai-Malaysia) joint exercise between the Malaysian and Thai  air forces at the Royal Malaysian Air Force (RMAF) base here.  Malaysia has sent about 1,500 soldiers to join the UN  peacekeeping force in response to the atrocities committed by  Serbs on Muslims in Bosnia.    Ten RMAF aircraft, including five F-5E jets and three OV-10  reconnaissance planes, are taking part in the exercise, an  annual series held on rotation between the two countries to  strengthen cooperation in operational procedures.</p>

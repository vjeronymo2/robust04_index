			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: Record HK offer reflects investor interest in China THE extraordinary investor interest in China was emphatically underlined yesterday when China Travel Service, a Beijing-owned company in Hong Kong, said its offer to the public of a 25 per cent interest in a subsidiary was 411 times oversubscribed. In contrast to other markets where new issues are failing to entice investors, local and international investors stumped up HKDollars 150bn (Dollars 19.4bn) to participate in an issue of 400m shares of HKDollars 1 each in China Travel International Investment Hong Kong, (CTII). The amount of money committed to the flotation was not far short of the capital cost of the colony's multi-billion dollar airport and related infrastructure projects - currently delayed due to a rupture in relations between Britain and China - and is the largest ever oversubscription in Hong Kong. Interest on the money, which CTS has for a week, would earn it about HKDollars 60m. In light of the tensions between the UK and China - due to plans to widen democracy in the colony before China's resumption of sovereignty in 1997 - the enthusiasm for the new issue also took many local analysts by surprise. CTS is one of the oldest Chinese companies in Hong Kong and has been controlled by Beijing since the Communists assumed power in 1949. It opened for business in the colony in 1928. CTS is one of the 'four heavenly sisters' - along with China Resources, China Merchants and Bank of China - and the second of them to float a subsidiary on the Hong Kong market. In July, China Merchants floated a subsidiary which was 373 times oversubscribed. In 1991, CTS made profits of HKDollars 97.3m on turnover of HKDollars 305.8m. The company's assets are a 51 per cent interest in two theme parks in Shenzhen, the special economic zone to the north of Hong Kong, and CTS's freight forwarding and transportation businesses. Mr Ma Chi Man, deputy chairman of CTS, said yesterday that CTII would be CTS's main listed vehicle in Hong Kong. In due course it may sell some of CTS's other assets to it. CTS has four main operating divisions - tourism, freight transport, trading and investment - and has ambitious plans for expansion in Hong Kong, Macao, China and elsewhere in Asia.</p>

			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: US butter for Russia under credit programme THE US Department of Agriculture has announced its first sale of butter to Russia under its three-year credit guarantee programme. The Dollars 55.35m sale of government-owned salted butter covered 34,600 tonnes, costing Dollars 1,567.50 a tonne, freight inclusive to Baltic Sea ports. Deliveries are scheduled for August through November. Russia has opted for butter costing more than the unallocated portion of total Dollars 300m made available for agricultural imports from the US earlier this month. The sale comes at a time when reports about the flow of grain to Russia are confused. But it is believed that imports have been rising, partly as a result of peasants holding back supplies in the hope of an increase in prices. On July 2, the USDA announced an acceleration in the Russian credit programme, making Dollars 300m in guarantees - double what had been expected  -immediately available. The commodity breakdown for the allocation was as follows: Dollars 96m for wheat; Dollars 55m for feed grains; Dollars 64m for protein meals; Dollars 12.1m for tallow; Dollars 6.3m for vegetable oil and Dollars 41.6m unallocated. On July 6, private exporters announced sales of 405,000 tonnes of maize and 115,000 tonnes of soyabean meal to Russia for delivery this year. On the following day came news of a 659,000 tonne wheat sale. The Dollars 300m allocation reflected the strong pressure on USDA to make credit available for sales of processed commodities and high value sales, like butter. Earlier this month, the Department donated 4,000 tonnes of butteroil to Kazakhstan. It was sold to the private sector, with the proceeds to be targeted for the neediest in the republic. The donation was made in co-operation with Mercy Corps International, which was to use local currency generated by the butteroil sale to distribute wheat flour previously donated by the US. The Department also donated 100 tonnes of non-fat dry milk to the republic of Georgia, bringing to nearly Dollars 200m the total value of humanitarian US food aid to the former republics. Export credit guarantees worth Dollars 55m were made available for commodity sales to the Ukraine on July 2.</p>

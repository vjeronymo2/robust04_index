			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / Elections introduced for accountancy post THE ELECTION for vice-president of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales is be contested for the first time, with three candidates standing for the post. Mr Patrick Brenan, a director of Minories Finance; Mr Chris Swinson, national managing partner of BDO Binder Hamlyn, the seventh-largest accountancy firm by fee income last year; and Mr Roger Lawson, a director of 3i, the venture capital group, have all been nominated. The position of vice-president has traditionally been nominated by the president's advisory committee, which at present has just eight senior members, and rubber-stamped at a meeting of the council in June. Only a handful have ever been non-practising members. The contest is only a partial movement towards democracy. The vice-president takes office in June and normally automatically becomes deputy president the following year and president the year after. In addition, only the 78 elected members of the council of the institute can vote, a process that will take place early next month. Mr Brenan has already issued a short manifesto saying the council has failed to act in the public interest against 'indefensible practices' and has not put forward policies in a sufficiently vigorous way. Mr Lawson is still preparing a statement but said yesterday that his main hope was to ensure that the institute resisted pressures that might cause it to split in two, between auditors and other accountants. Commenting on the introduction of elections, he said: 'It's a major move forward. I think we're finally moving into the twentieth century.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Kuala Lumpur, April 20, IRNA -- Majles Speaker 'Ali  Akbar Nateq-Nuri Tuesday termed the fall of Gorazde as an  "intolerable crime" and said that the tragic catastrophe was  indicative of a conspiracy masterminded by the U.S. and its  Western allies.    Speaking at a press conference here the speaker reiterated  that the fall of Gorazde proved the futility of all U.N.,  Security Council and NATO agreements.    Nateq-Nuri said that the world free nations, especially  Muslims, should help and support the oppressed people of  Bosnia-Herzegovina with all their might.    Nateq-Nuri blamed the U.N. Secretary General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali for his ineptitude and weakness in dealing with  Bosnian issue. He also said that Butrus-Ghali's resignation  prior to the fall of Gorazde would have been to his benefit  because it would have assured him of a good reputation in  history as "an honest and truthful man."    Referring to the outcome of his discussions with Malaysian  officials including his counterpart Mohamed Zahir bin Haji  Ismail and the Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed as positive and  constructive, the speaker said that decisions on promotion of  economic and trade relations as well as on the expansion of  political relations have been made by the two sides.    On bilateral economic cooperation, he commented that the  joint economic commission would soon pave the way for a more  active participation of private sector and Iran will also  increase its purchase of palm oil from Malaysia.    On Iran-Iraq relations, Nateq-Nuri stressed that discussions  at foreign ministry level have been held.    He expressed hope that agreements would be reached in this  regard and added that Iran for its part has no reluctance to  cooperate with Iraq.</p>

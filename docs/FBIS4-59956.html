			<p>BFN     [Text] The prime minister has asked the nonresident  Indians, NRIs, to play their legitimate role in the speedy  development of the country. Addressing a large gathering of  NRIs in New York, Mr. Narasimha Rao asked them to evaluate for  themselves the reform process without attaching any emotions.  He emphatically stated that the economic changes underway in  India are irreversible. The prime minister invited them to take  advantage of the opportunities and invest in the country to help  expand and strengthen the economic liberalization process. He  said that structural hurdles posed at the initial stages have  been overcome and there is a turnaround now. The prime minister  appreciated the good work being carried out by the NRIs in  various walks of life outside the country.    Our correspondent Rama Rao, covering the prime minister's  visit, reports from New York that Mr. Narasimha Rao will be  meeting the captains of industry at Houston today in the second  leg of his visit to the United States. He described the visit  as a step towards a strong, friendly, and cordial cooperation  between the two great democracies of the world. During his  one-day stay in Houston, the prime minister will be meeting the  chief executive officers and presidents of the major companies  under the auspices of the Greater Houston Partnership. The  partnership brings together over 2,000 companies based in the  city. The mayor of Houston will be presenting the keys of the  city to Mr. Narasimha Rao. The prime minister will attend an  Indian community reception before leaving for Boston tomorrow.    Our special correspondent Bhupal Inder Saini reports from  Washington:    [Begin Saini recording] One of the primary objectives of the  prime minister's goodwill visit to the United States is to  explore the potentials and opportunities of stepping up  Indo-American cooperation in the economic sphere. The United  States is already India's largest trading partner and the  economic reforms undertaken by New Delhi under Mr. Narasimha  Rao's leadership had created tremendous opportunities for  further stepping up economic links and trade. Significantly, a  large number of leading Indian businessmen are also in the  United States to tap the potential for tie-ups with American  companies.  [end recording]</p>

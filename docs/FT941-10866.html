			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / EU smiles more kindly on Ukraine Foreign ministers of the European Union were last night poised to give the green light for talks on a more generous trade agreement with Ukraine to be concluded before next month's elections there. The proposed agreement is viewed as a tool for strengthening the hands of moderates in the republic as they struggle to prevent the disintegration of the economy and the rise of nationalism. During his visit to Washington last week, Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, was told by Mr William Perry, the new US defence secretary, that the Clinton administration viewed political instability in nuclear-armed Ukraine as the number one national security problem. The proposed partnership and co-operation agreement between the EU and Ukraine would be broadly similar to one currently under negotiation with Russia. It suggests that the European Union is trying to pursue a less Russo-centric and more even-handed policy toward the two most important ex-Soviet republics. EU officials said ministers were likely to give the European Commission the go-ahead for a new mandate for talks aimed at reaching agreement before the parliamentary elections on March 27. Ukraine would like to include a commitment by the EU to review the partnership accord in 1998, with a view to joining a future free trade zone. It also wants more generous access for Ukrainian steel and aluminium imports, and an easing of restrictions on visas for businessmen. Mr Anatoly Zlenko, Ukraine's foreign minister, is due in Brussels today. He is expected to submit Ukraine's formal application to join the Nato alliance's Partnership for Peace, and to hold talks with the Greek presidency on the trade accord.</p>

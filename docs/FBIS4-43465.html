			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Yalcin Dogan from the "Daily" column: "In the Grip of </F> Poised Hammer"]    [Text] Poised Hammer officials could not care less.  Poised Hammer officials and the Americans say: "In that case  we would move to south Cyprus." Turkey, on the other hand, is  being presumptuous regarding the Poised Hammer mandate.    Using Poised Hammer as a "trump card" was conceived when the  United States was determined to decrease its aid to Turkey. The  United States decided to cut the aid on the grounds that "Turkey  is violating human rights." In reaction to this reasoning,  Ankara declared that, in turn, it will not extend the Poised  Hammer mandate, and went a step further noting, "if we want, we  will reject all aid that is linked to conditions."    Ankara did not stop to argue whether or not human rights are  actually being violated in Turkey. Nor does it turn inward and  investigate "if human rights are really being violated." Maybe  Ankara finds this an exercise in futility, because it knows that  human rights are being violated in Turkey. Struggling against  terrorism is one matter, and human rights violations are  another. The easiest way out is to have a knee-jerk reaction,  because these two issues are intermingled and because the  administration's head is not clear on the matter.    What is tragic and comical at the same time is the fact that  even this reaction is merely a show. Stating "I will not accept  aid that is linked to conditions" is a cheap move. Can Tansu  Ciller easily turn her back on the United States? The United  States could not be deceived by this bluff on the part of  Ciller, who owes her power to Clinton. It is as clear as day  that this was meant for internal consumption.    Last week, on the day that Poised Hammer was raised as a  trump card, the Americans conveyed their position to Ankara:    "In that case, we would move to south Cyprus. Much as  Incirlik is a suitable place for supervising north Iraq, we can  do the same from south Cyprus." Later, Washington added the  following:    "We must cross Syria to fly from south Cyprus to north Iraq.  We can obtain the necessary flight permit from Damascus. This  can be done by us or by Talabani."    Poised Hammer has favorable relations with Talabani, who in  turn has favorable relations with Damascus. Moreover, there is  an ongoing dialogue between the United States and Damascus. In  other words, if Turkey fails to extend the Poised Hammer  mandate, it will not undermine the United States in any way.  Therefore, as on many occasions in the past year, Ankara is  once again making useless noise.    What is more, the U.S. Administration also said:    "When Turkey found itself in an economic crisis, Ciller  asked  President Clinton for help. Through the secretary of the  treasury, Clinton called on IMF President Camdessus to support  Turkey."    Nothing else need be said. This is what the United States  wanted to say: "You cannot do much to us with Poised Hammer,  but even if we do nothing, at the very least we can put a stop  to IMF support." As things stand, therefore, Turkey, especially  Ciller, do not have such power.    It is not so easy to govern a country merely by making noise  for internal consumption. Last week's gesture is already  wearing thin. Ankara is submissively deciding to extend the  mandate of Poised Hammer. It is even determined to exert  extensive efforts to this end.    This time, however, the problem lies with the Turkish Grand  National Assembly. Although the National Security Council and  the government decided in favor of the extension, it is  difficult to gauge how effective this recommendation will be in  the assembly. Not only the opposition, but members of the two  coalition partners also believe that significant obstacles will  emerge during the voting.    Even the last vote on the extension of the Poised Hammer  mandate was a laborious one. Six months ago, the motion was  adopted 194 votes to 160, while 87 deputies abstained.    Now, the Motherland Party is leaning toward negative votes  and there are at least 25 Social Democratic Populist Party  members who share the same tendency. This time, there are even  those within the True Path Party who are opposed to Poised  Hammer. Therefore, this will be an extremely critical vote for  the government.    There is much agitation in Ankara now, and last week's  bluffing has long been forgotten. Ciller is now exerting every  possible effort to secure the extension of the mandate. If you  do not know how to govern a country, this is the way you get  your nose rubbed in it.</p>

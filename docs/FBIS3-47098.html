Foreign Minister Datuk  Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said in Kepala Batas that reports that  several Western countries wanted to withdraw their peacekeeping  troops from Bosnia were the most serious development. As such,  he said Malaysia does not want the withdrawal to cause a vacuum  which could be detrimental for the Bosnians who are under  Serbian insurgency.    Datuk Abdullah added that Britain, France, and Canada were  among several countries which had warned that they might pull  out from UNPROFOR if the chaotic situation continued in Bosnia  and was endangering their forces. He said Malaysia viewed the  statements with concern and hoped the UN would not allow the  Bosnians to be left without any means to defend themselves. Any  vacuum, apart from complicating the security situation, would  also jeopardize UNPROFOR's role in the dispatch of food,  clothing, and medical needs. He also urged the UN to lift its  arms embargo imposed on former Yugoslavia to enable the Bosnians  to secure weapons to defend their nation.</p>

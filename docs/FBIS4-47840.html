			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Erica Jankowitz] </F>   [Text] Most companies questioned in a recent survey were  not prepared to negotiate an affirmative action policy with  representative trade unions, and this was likely to be a source  of serious conflict, industrial relations consultant Larry Palk  said.    Palk's survey of 128 companies throughout SA found that 18  percent of respondents were not prepared to negotiate  affirmative action issues. Of these 45 percent would consult a  union and 36 percent would inform the union of their policies,  but not discuss the content.    "Union involvement is likely to be a source of conflict  since  unions have clearly stated that they believe affirmative action  issues need to be negotiated."    Palk's survey found that 95 percent of top management  positions were held by whites, who also occupied 86 percent of  middle- management positions and 63 percent of skilled worker  positions.    He warned that it would take many years to change the  composition of a company's workforce to reflect the labour  market's racial breakdown, especially at a time when formal  sector labour turnover stood at between 5 percent and 10 percent.    "If this rate of turnover persists, there will not be much  room to make substantial progress with affirmative action  without major economic growth.    "This could lead to unfulfilled expectations which have been  heightened in regard to affirmative action." Palk found that  most progress in implementing affirmative action policies had  been made in service industries where front-office staff  interacted with the public. In industries which were task-  rather than service-oriented, much less had been done, with the  exception of the oil, chemical, pharmaceutical and food and  beverage industries.    Males dominated top and middle-management posts, but females  had made inroads into skilled worker categories. This was the  case in the financial, insurance and banking industry where  women accounted for 62 percent of skilled workers. Male  dominance was most pronounced in mining, with men occupying 90  percent or more of the positions in all three categories.    "A minority of companies has shown commitment to affirmative  action by drawing up a written policy; an even smaller minority  has communicated this to employees. These findings are rather  disturbing since there is a high expectation of affirmative  action taking place."</p>

			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Bangemann firm on European union COUNTRIES which want to pick and choose which policies of the European union created by Maastricht they want to sign up to 'should consider whether they really want to belong to this Community,' according to Mr Martin Bangemann, Germany's senior commissioner in Brussels. Flatly rejecting 'any idea of an a la carte Europe' as a step back into nationalism which would threaten the Community's survival, Mr Bangemann reiterated his well-known view that 'there is no alternative to a European federal state.' His remarks, due to be made at a dinner given in his honour by Bremen city council last night and circulated in English and French in Brussels, made explicit reference to the current problems facing ratification of the treaty, and could provide ammunition for anti-Maastricht forces in the UK and Denmark. On the eve of last November's narrowly won 'paving debate' vote on Maastricht in the House of Commons, Mr Bangemann infuriated the British government with a speech arguing that the treaty was a milestone to a federal European state, and that 'more and more decisions can only be taken at European level.' Both the UK and Denmark are attempting to secure ratification on the basis of opt-outs from the treaty, and the German commissioner appeared to be taking square aim at these in his speech, as much as warning EC applicants like Austria, Sweden and Finland that they would have to sign up to the whole treaty. 'A united Europe in which each state is allowed to pick and choose has no realistic chances of survival,' Mr Bangemann said. 'Those who have other conceptions of the future Europe should consider whether they really want to belong to this Community,' he added. Mr Bangemann's remarks were distinct and sharper in tone from what Commission president Jacques Delors said in his 'state of the union' address to the European Parliament on Wednesday. It is the official policy of the 12, laid down by December's Edinburgh summit, that new EC members must accept the full Community 'acquis'. But Mr Delors distinguished between that and 'grandfather rights' of existing members like Denmark and the UK - whose opt-outs he regretted, but said should be seen as an earned 'long-service' bonus'.</p>

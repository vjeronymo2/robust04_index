			<p><P> April 9, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GREEN IS RED HOT FOR LAKERS  </P> <P> At times, Laker forward A.C. Green drove the lane as fast and reckless as a New  York cab driver. He was drawn to missed shots like a heat-seeking missile.  Defensively, he did not let his man free.  </P> <P> On top of all that, his outside shooting simply left Denver Nugget players  shaking their heads.  </P> <P> Green was everywhere, and was the biggest of several reasons why the Lakers  pulled out a 116-109 victory Sunday evening over the Nuggets to further  distance themselves from the Detroit Pistons in the race for the NBA's best  record.  </P> <P> Starting at center because of Mychal Thompson's hyper-extended right knee,  Green responded with 26 points, a career-high 18 rebounds and had a hand in  repelling Nugget comeback attempts in the final minutes. Green's turnaround  17-foot jump shot with 57 seconds to play, heaved just to avoid a 24-second  clock violation, put Nugget hopes to rest for good.  </P> <P> The Lakers' sixth straight victory might have ended the Pistons' hope of  finishing with the league's best record and home-court advantage throughout the  playoffs. The Lakers (57-17), who have eight games to left, lead the Pistons  (54-21) by four games in the loss column.  </P> <P> Had it not been for Green, as well as strong bench play, the Lakers might not  be in quite so good a position entering the regular season's final two weeks.  </P> <P> That Green was a force against the Nuggets is not surprising. Denver's  philosophy is to trap and double team Magic Johnson and James Worthy and, well,  everybody except Green. And, just as he did in Denver two months ago, Green had  a big night.  </P> <P> Left free to roam the perimeter, wander the key and crash the boards, Green  scored four baskets inside of five feet, made three perimeter jump shots, and  even sank a baseline hook and had an above-the-rim tip-in.  </P> <P> Green was not alone in turning back the Nuggets, now only a half game ahead of  Seattle for the eighth and final playoff spot. Worthy scored 21 of his 29  points in the first half and finished with nine assists. Johnson had 19 points  and 11 rebounds. Vlade Divac, playing 26 minutes because of Thompson's absence,  had 14 points and six rebounds. And Michael Cooper, starting at forward,  limited Alex English to seven points.  </P> <P> But when the Nuggets had to select a Laker to ignore, it was Green. And, they  paid for it.  </P> <P> "There are still people in this league who think A.C. can't shoot outside,"  Riley said. "A.C. is an effort player, and you have to have effort players when  you play Denver. Their passing game and their trapping defense leaves a lot of  open seams and lanes for A.C. to go. No one blocks him out and A.C. always  makes the effort to get there."  </P> <P> Green says he does not play any differently against the Nuggets than any other  team. He insisted he does not especially look forward to playing against the  Nuggets.  </P> <P> "Maybe it's just the way they defend us," Green said. "We're a team blessed  with such talent that they can't play everyone one-on-one. They got to leave  somebody open."  </P> <P> Green said he did not feel particularly potent offensively. He said his jump  shot felt a little awkward and said he was affected early by the high altitude.  </P> <P> "I just kept trying to get a hand on the ball," Green said. "I tried to give  the best effort I could."  </P> <P> The same could be said for Green's teammates. While the Pistons are slumping  without guard Joe Dumars, the Lakers overcame the loss of Thompson.  </P> <P> "It was a real great game for us," Riley said. "We went dead in the water for  about three or four minutes in the third quarter. But we played 44 minutes of  great basketball."  </P> <P> Against the Nuggets, that proved enough. But Riley admitted to being a tad  concerned during the Lakers' lone lull, which hit in the final 3:40 of the  third quarter.  </P> <P> The Nuggets hit stride with a 16-4 run, as the Laker offense unaccountably  segued into disarray. The Lakers had four turnovers, missed two easy shots and  Byron Scott did not even draw iron on a three-point attempt. Their lone basket  came on a Worthy jumper with 1:52 to play.  </P> <P> So, an 83-74 lead turned into a 90-85 deficit entering the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> Green and Johnson, who sat out most of the third-quarter drought, returned at  the start of the fourth quarter. So, too, did the Lakers' composure. It took  then slightly less than four minutes to regain the lead and, every time the  Nuggets threatened, the Lakers responded with big baskets.  </P> <P> Green scored eight of the Lakers' last 12 points and, consequently, Denver  could get no closer than seven points.  </P> <P> One of Green's most impressive efforts came with 3:40 to play. Orlando  Woolridge missed a shot, then Magic Johnson missed a three-point shot, then  Woolridge missed another follow attempt. Green found position underneath and  tipped in Woolridge's second miss. Green later sank four free throws, leading  to his turnaround jumper that put the Nuggets to rest.  </P></p>

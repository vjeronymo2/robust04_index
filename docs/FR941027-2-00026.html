Great Lakes states these proposed tariff sheets were filed to reflect Great Lakes' compliance with the Commission's January 26, 1994, orders in Docket Nos. CP92&hyph;595&hyph;000 and CP92&hyph;606&hyph;000. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Great Lakes states that the Commission's orders authorized Great Lakes to construct facilities to provide Part 284 blanket transportation service to Rochester Gas and Electronic Company and Sithe/Independence Power Partners, L.P. Great Lakes explains that the Commission recognized that there would be an additional 12,000 Mcf of capacity available per day. Great Lakes relates that it conducted an open season which resulted in Mercury Exploration Company becoming the shipper for that capacity. Great Lakes asserts that the sheets reflect the separately stated incremental rates set forth in the Commission orders for such services. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Great Lakes requests that the tariff sheets become effective November 1, 1994. Great Lakes relates that construction was completed earlier than expected, and the facilities authorized in Docket No. CP92&hyph;606&hyph;000 will be able to be placed into service on November 1, 1994, rather than the originally estimated date of January 1, 1995. Great Lakes states that this filing has been served on all of its customers and the Public Service Commissions of the states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any party desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Section 385.211 of the Commission's regulations.

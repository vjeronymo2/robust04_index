			<p><P> October 12, 1989, Thursday, Valley P.M. Final  </P> <P> 1,200 EVACUATED AT ROCKWELL PLANT AFTER FIRE NEXT TO CHEMICAL TANK  </P> <P> About 1,200 people were evacuated this morning from a Rockwell International  plant in Canoga Park after a fire erupted next to a chemical storage tank in a  building where space shuttle engines are manufactured, authorities said.  </P> <P> Authorities said 57 people were examined by paramedics and doctors after  complaining of feeling ill from fumes that may have escaped from the tank; 10,  including three Rocketdyne firefighters, were hospitalized for observation  after the fire at Rockwell's Rocketdyne Division in the 6600 block of Canoga  Avenue.  </P> <P> The fire was spotted about 9:20 a.m. next to a 900-gallon tank containing a  highly toxic mixture of hydrofluoric and nitric acids and water that is used to  clean stainless steel components of shuttle engines, the Los Angeles Fire  Department said.  </P> <P> "There were people working in the area at the time, but they got out right  away," said Pat Coulter, spokesman for Rocketdyne.  </P> <P> Dan Boyd, manager of the area where the fire broke out, said he saw flames  seven feet high next to the tank. The cause of the fire was still under  investigation, but Assistant Fire Chief Alan Schroeder said the blaze may have  been caused by a chemical reaction.  </P> <P> The fire was in the sprawling plant's Building 1, a huge hangar-like shop where  the shuttle engines are built, and two adjoining floors of engineers and  designers' offices. The building was closed for the day after the evacuation  and the employees were sent home, officials said.  </P> <P> Schroeder said no liquid chemicals escaped from the tank and the leakage of  fumes was probably minor. That led to some discrepancy in how authorities  viewed the number of injuries.  </P> <P> "We did have inhalation injuries -- nobody we would describe as being serious,"  Assistant Chief Paramedic A. N. Norman said.  </P> <P> Schroeder said that some of the complaints of illness were probably a reaction  caused by hysteria.  </P> <P> "There probably were some fumes in the building and any time people work in a  building like this and they get a whiff of something . . . , " Schroeder said.  "We send them to the hospital to determine if it is hysteria or an actual  reaction to a chemical."  </P> <P> Several people examined at the scene complained of scratchy throats, dizziness  and nausea. Most said, however, that the evacuation proceeded quickly and  orderly, as with company safety drills.  </P> <P> "I think it was handled pretty smoothly, mainly due to the previous training  that employees have had," said a man who complained of a sore throat after the  evacuation. "There is a potential here for chemical hazards, and it's important  that everybody here is well trained to handled this type of situation."  </P> <P> The fire was initially fought by three Rocketdyne firefighters and then put out  when city firefighters arrived, officials said. A total of 80 firefighters and  five paramedic teams were called to the plant.  </P></p>

			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Czechs to complete Temelin N-plant THE CZECH government yesterday gave the go-ahead for completion of the controversial Kcs68bn (Pounds 1.6bn) nuclear power plant at Temelin in southern Bohemia. The decision will be a relief to Westinghouse Corporation of the US, which won two tenders to help to rehabilitate the plant. Its completion has been strongly opposed by local environmental groups and by neighbouring Austria. More than Kcs25bn has been spent on the plant, with orders for another Kcs19bn placed for equipment, engineering and construction. Westinghouse will provide high-quality fuels and upgrade the plant to western standards with new control systems - two of the recommendations by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) after a study of the plant in 1990. The original decision to build two Soviet-designed VVER (pressurised water reactor) units of 1,000MW each was taken in 1977, but the plant was put on ice after the 1986 disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in Ukraine.</p>

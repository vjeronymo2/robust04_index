			<p>BFN     [Text] Dear Rwandans, lies in our country are too  widespread. Have you heard the lies spread by the clique of  killers on their radios, RTLM [Radio-Television Libre des Mille  Collines] and Radio Rwanda? The clique continues to lie to the  world about Rwandan issues, saying that the problem in Rwanda is  ethnic. However, in reality the problem is political. The  clique continues to mislead Rwandans by using the ethnic issue,  even though it is irrelevant.    They claim their troops are fighting against Belgians and  Ugandans in addition to the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF].  These are pure lies. In their claim that they are fighting  Belgians, Ugandans and the RPF, we want to know how their troops  are fighting? What are their numbers so as to be able to fight  whites, foreigners and the RPF all at the same time? Rwandans,  you can understand that these are lies. You should not listen  to the clique of killers who are following their own interests,  as has always been the case when they dare to claim that their  troops are doing well at the front, as if the troops themselves  are unaware of how they have been defeated by the RPF troops.  They were defeated, they fled [words indistinct].</p>

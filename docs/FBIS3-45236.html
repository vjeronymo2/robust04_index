According to local foreign trade officials, in 1993 the  province clinched 101.74 million U.S. dollars in exports,  fulfilling the state-set export quota for the province and also  representing an increase of 12.51 percent over the previous year.    The officials attributed the initial success chiefly to the  fact that relevant local departments helped export-oriented  enterprises solve difficulties and some practical problems.  Foreign trade departments also strived to make a success of the  export of the province's traditional products, such as carpets  and ferrosilicon, while endeavoring to develop new commodities  in greater varieties for export.    So far, the province has 30 specialized foreign trade,  economic and technical cooperation companies, and has  established stable trade relations with more than 40 countries  and regions in the world. The variety of commodities for export  has increased from only nine kinds in 1980 to the present 120  kinds in 12 categories.</p>

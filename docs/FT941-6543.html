			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Strong advance backed by trading programmes - Market report Favourable developments on the global interest rate front, backed up by strong rises in UK government securities, drove UK equities ahead yesterday in what was almost a mirror image of last Thursday's setback. Encouraged by buoyancy in New York, London closed at the best of the day, and trading volume picked up after a drab start. The stock market continued to concentrate on its own concerns, which encompassed bond yields and interest rate prospects, and largely ignored wider issues including the downing of four Bosnian aircraft by UN forces. Reports from the meeting of G7 finance ministers indicated renewed pressure to stimulate global economies. The final reading for the opening session of the new trading account showed the FT-SE 100 Index 46.9 ahead at 3,328.1. Share prices were in positive form throughout the session, following a bond market encouraged first by news that the Bundesbank had made a variable repo offer, which was interpreted as a nod towards lower interest rates, and then by comments from a governor of the US Federal Reserve that the board's recent modest tightening of policy might prove sufficient to ward off inflationary pressures. Both moves strengthened the growing hopes in London that last week's sudden alarm over interest rates had been wildly overdone. Traders saw some genuine buying interest, including a strong buying programme among the engineering and oil stocks from a leading overseas-based securities house. At least one other trading programme appeared to cross the trading screens as the market began to gather confidence. The improvement spread across the range of the market, lifting the FT-SE Mid 250 Index by 40.1 to 3,960. Trading volume was slow to dev-elop until the trading programmes made their appearance. By the close, Seaq volume totalled 705.7m shares, against 792m on Friday when retail, or customer, business returned a money value of Pounds 1.68bn. Selling pressure was relatively light during last week's shakeout in the stock market. Share gains ranged through the retail and consumer sectors, which are immediate beneficiaries from a more relaxed interest rate environment, to the financial sectors, which had fallen so sharply during the market setback. Notably lagging the market were the big pharmaceutical groups, which have underperformed for several months and continue to fail to hold the confidence of the big international investment funds that were once strong supporters of the sector. Hongkong and Shanghai Banking responded strongly at first to the excellent dividend and profits news, but the shares cooled off before the close. The banking sector showed some disappointment last week with trading results from National Westminster Bank, raising some concern among market strategists lest the widely anticipated improvement in corporate profits should fail to boost the stock market. In spite of yesterday's improvements in European bond markets, investors remained nervous regarding the near term outlook. Some have suggested that the UK stock market will now switch from being 'interest-rate driven to being corporate-result driven'. The next fortnight will bring profits statements from companies representing around one-third of the market capitalisation of the London stock market.</p>

			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / One-day Tube strike called off RAIL UNIONS yesterday called off a one-day strike on the London Underground planned for tomorrow after agreeing a compromise with management over job losses. The agreement lifts the threat of a series of 24-hour stoppages similar to those which disrupted the Tube network two years ago. However, a threat to British Rail services during the summer remains because of a separate dispute over a 7 per cent pay offer. RMT, the largest rail union, is seeking members' support for industrial action, although BR said yesterday that arbitration over a similar offer to the TSSA and Aslef unions will start on Thursday. Settlement of the Underground dispute follows two days of talks last week at Acas, the conciliation service. London Underground yesterday denied RMT claims that it had agreed to save 200 of 1,005 jobs it planned to cut from its 22,500 total. There would still be 800 job losses among members of RMT and TSSA, the other union which had threatened a strike tomorrow. The other 200 or so jobs to go would be among Aslef members or employees who do not belong to a union. In the Acas talks, however, London Underground said there were no plans for further job losses at present, thus allaying union fears of a 'hidden agenda' on staff numbers.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Hamburg, Germany, Feb 16 (AFP) -- UN Secretary  General Botrus Butrus-Ghali has said he "would not hesitate a  moment" to implement Security Council decisions for air strikes  against Serb artillery around Sarajevo.    In an interview with DIE WOCHE magazine made available  Wednesday [16 February], Butrus-Ghali said: "If NATO gives me a  mandate, I can deal with it straight away, as I already have a  UN mandate."    However, he said that "who exactly gives the green light for  air strikes" was not yet fixed.    The magazine said that the bulk of the interview was  conducted last week in Brussels, but it confirmed details with  Butrus-Ghali on Monday and Tuesday -- which was when the  Security Council met on the air strikes question.    The secretary general said the UN welcomed NATO's February 9  decision to mount airstrikes against Serb artillery if it were  not withdrawn to 20 kilometres from Sarajevo city centre or put  under UN control within 10 days.    According to Butrus-Ghali, the UN had helped bring about the  decision. "We confronted NATO with its responsibilities and  contributed to its new decisive attitude," he said.    In the interview, the secretary general was asked if air  strikes could fail to take place because of Russian opposition.    He replied that some Security Council members such as Russia  had their own interpretation of certain resolutions, seeing a  distinction between air support and air strikes.    For the moment, he added, the Russian Federation shared the  aims of the United States, the European Community, and the UN  and was playing an active role in the Geneva talks between the  warring parties of Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Asked if a lifting of the arms embargo might be more  effective than the threat of air strikes, he said any such  decision would be for the Security Council to take and so far it  had rejected this.    Asked his own position on the question, Butrus-Ghali said he  would follow the decision of the Council. "I believe the  Security Council must assume the responsibility for such an  undertaking," he said.    He said the UN had not yet established responsibility for  the  shell which exploded in a Sarajevo market on February 6, killing  68 people and wounding nearly 200, and prompting the NATO air  strikes decision.    Asked who he believed was mainly responsibility for the  continuation of the war in Bosnia, the secretary general blamed  not only the warring parties but also UN member states which  failed to respond to appeals to send more troops.    He primarily blamed the warring parties "but also the  international community which is not making the necessary  efforts to find a solution."</p>

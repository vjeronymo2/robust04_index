			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC;  </P> <P> FROM PERSIA: 'MUSIC WHICH MAKES PEOPLE THINK'  </P> <P> Persian music has been described as introverted and meditative, and Ali Reza  Shajarian, who is presenting a concert of "Persian Music and Poetry" at the  Performing Arts Center on Saturday, agrees.  </P> <P> "This is music which makes people think," Shajarian said in a phone  conversation last week from San Jose, prior to a concert at UC Berkeley. "It  has a great deal of spirituality. . . . You have to really, deeply listen to  it. But if you let the music take you, it will take you very easily into deep  thinking."  </P> <P> Shajarian is managing the tour, which enlists his brother Mohamman Reza  Shajarian as composer and vocalist.  </P> <P> The other musicians -- all from Iran -- include Dariush Pirniakan, who plays  the tar and setar; Jamshid Andalibi, who plays the nay, and Morteza Ayan, the  tonbak.  </P> <P> (A tar is a long-necked lute with eight strings; a setar also is a lute, but  with four strings. A nay is a wooden flute. A tonbak is a goblet-shaped drum.)  </P> <P> The players will be finishing up their 12-city tour in Costa Mesa. The tour  began in July at UCLA and included Seattle, Chicago, New York, Boston,  Washington and Philadelphia.  </P> <P> "The purpose of the concert is to introduce the culture of Persia to the  American people, and especially to Iranians, since they've been very long away  from home," Shajarian said.  </P> <P> But why call it "Persian" rather than Iranian?  </P> <P> "Persian, Iranian -- it's the same thing," he said. "Here, they call it Persia.  It's Iranian music and poetry."  </P> <P> Despite the official freeze between the two countries, Shajarian said that he  and his musicians had no trouble entering the United States.  </P> <P> "They give visas very easily," Shajarian said. "People travel back and forth.  There are no problems."  </P> <P> While Shajarian said that he hopes such concerts as his will promote better  relations between the United States and Iran, he steadfastly maintained, "I  don't know anything about the politics."  </P> <P> Classical music of Persia is a survivor. Ever since the Safavid dynasty  (1501-1722), the attitude of Shiite religious leaders towards music has been  generally hostile.  </P> <P> They have regarded it as a form of frivolity, as an art form that can lead to  impiety. Consequently from the 16th Century to the early 20th, Persian music  was frowned upon. It fell into disgrace and declined.  </P> <P> Beginning in this century, however, the Iranian government initiated efforts to  preserve and promote its musical culture.  </P> <P> Those who don't understand Farsi may run into one problem at the concert,  however. There will be no translations.  </P> <P> "We had a brochure in English at the other concerts," said Shajarian, "but we  ran out, and there is no time to print any more. We were not expecting so many  people! People have been very grateful for this concert. Americans love this  music so much."  </P> <P> Any protests?  </P> <P> "Not at all," he said.  </P></p>

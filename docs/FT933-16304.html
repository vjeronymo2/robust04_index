			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / White gloves mark start of election bout JAPAN'S politicians slipped on the white gloves and mounted their loudspeaker vans yesterday for the official start of an election campaign which is expected to end with the ruling Liberal Democratic party losing its control over the country. The LDP and opposition parties presume that the July 18 election will lead to the formation of coalition government, which could hinder Japan's ability to respond to trade issues and delay a forecast recovery of the economy. LDP officials are already courting opposition parties, but the head of the Japan New Party, Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, who is likely to make or break a new government, said voters had a unique opportunity to 'say sayonara to the LDP'. The election was called after the LDP lost a motion of no-confidence, proposed after the party had stalled reforms to a scandal-stained political system, provoking one of its own factions to vote for the motion and then form a new party, the Japan Renewal party. Heads of the Group of Seven leading industrialised nations meeting in Tokyo this week will find themselves surrounded by the campaign. They will be greeted by Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, in a mood to show Japanese voters that he is a leader of international stature. Mr Miyazawa launched the LDP campaign yesterday by warning that the country would be led into chaos by a coalition headed by the Social Democratic party, formerly known as the Japan Socialist party. Japanese politicians, some with no sense of irony, wear white gloves to prove they are clean. 'Will the Socialists close nuclear power plants? What will they do about our important neighbour, South Korea?' asked Mr Miyazawa, referring to unsettled policy issues in the SDP, which is attempting to hitch its campaign to the popular demand for political reform. Most politicians said the campaign marked the beginning of a 'new era' in Japanese government, which the LDP has dominated since its formation in 1955. But defections have left the party with only 285 candidates competing for 511 seats, suggesting it is unlikely to muster a maj-ority. The SDP is fielding only 142 candidates so it, too, will need to find partners to form a new government. There are many potential coalitions, with the JNP perhaps aligning with the LDP, if the party dumps Mr Miyazawa and appoints a new leader with better reform credentials. Mr Tsutomu Hata, the former finance minister and LDP rebel who formed the JRP, campaigning in bare hands, said Japanese voters had an 'appointment with destiny' at this election: 'We have to change the Japanese political system and that change must come now.'</p>

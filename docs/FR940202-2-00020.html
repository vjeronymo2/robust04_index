This action is being conducted in accordance with the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;510) and the specific 1993 base closure and realignment decisions which became effective in September 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed action involves the relocation of personnel and activities from the Naval Air Systems Command, Arlington, Virginia, and from NAWCAD Trenton, New Jersey, to NAWCAD Patuxent River and, possibly, to the Naval Electronic Systems Engineering Activity (NESEA) site, St. Inigoes, Maryland. The Navy was directed to close NESEA St. Inigoes by the same 1993 base closure and realignment decisions; however, it was decided that the property would not be disposed of, but would be transferred to the Naval Air Systems Command to support its relocation to southeastern Maryland. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to meet the facility and operational requirements of the realigning activities at the two receiving sites, the realignment will require 500,000 to 700,000 square feet of facilities. These facility and operational requirements will be met through the utilization of existing space (renovation of buildings) and/or new construction of facilities, such as administrative buildings, parking structures, test labs and other support facilities. Approximately 3,000 additional personnel, with their dependents, will relocate to support the various activities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Alternatives addressed in the EIS will focus on means of meeting realignment requirements at NAWCAD Patuxent River, including alternative construction site locations. The EIS will discuss environmental impacts resulting from the construction and operation of facilities as well as expected associated impacts to the local communities resulting from the relocation of military and civilian personnel and their dependents. Major environmental issues that will be addressed in the EIS will include, but not be limited to, impacts on cultural resources, terrestrial and aquatic habitats, stormwater runoff, noise, and air quality. Other impacts to be considered will include impacts to community services, such as school capacity, infrastructure, and traffic. Cumulative impacts associated with the realignment of all personnel and activities to the region around NAWCAD Patuxent River will be considered. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Navy will initiate a scoping process for the purpose of determining the scope of issues to be addressed and for identifying the significant issues related to this action. The Navy will hold a public scoping meeting on Thursday, February 17, 1994, beginning at 7 p.m. at the Carter Office Building, Leonardtown, Maryland. The meeting will be advertised in Southern Maryland tri-county area newspapers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A brief presentation will precede requests for public comment. Navy representatives will be available at this meeting to receive comments from the public regarding issues of concern. It is important that federal, state, and local agencies and interested individuals take this opportunity to identify environmental concerns that should be addressed during the preparation of the EIS. In the interest of available time, each speaker will be asked to limit his/her oral comments to five minutes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agencies and the public are also invited and encouraged to provide written comments in addition to, or in lieu of, oral comments at the public meeting. To be most helpful, scoping comments should clearly describe specific issues or topics which the commentor believes the EIS should address. Written statements and or questions regarding the scoping process should be mailed to: Commanding Officer, Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Building 407, Patuxent River, Maryland 20670&hyph;5409, (Attn: Joan Hinson), telephone (301) 826&hyph;7512. All comments must be received no later than March 28, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: January 28, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Michael P.

			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Employers 'hostile' to pregnant women CITIZENS' Advice Bureaux are to press the government for tighter rules on the protection of pregnant women at work. The call follows evidence that women are being dismissed when their employers find out they are pregnant, the National Association Citizens Advice Bureaux claims in a report published today. The association says the attitudes of some employers to pregnancy are 'hostile and uninformed'. It is the latest group to lobby for increased legal protection for pregnant women ahead of the meeting of EC ministers responsible for employment legislation in Luxembourg tomorrow. Both the Equal Opportunities Commission and the Labour party yesterday urged the government to agree to improvements in maternity pay. Mr Tony Blair, the opposition employment spokesman, was joined by MEPs at a news conference to press the case for all women having 16 weeks paid leave, remunerated at 80 per cent of their regular salaries. The UK government wants the payments to be at a lower rate, equivalent to statutory sick pay levels. It is thought unlikely that British objections will be overruled tomorrow: either maternity pay at the lower rate is likely to be agreed or the draft directive in its entirety could be scrapped. The Equal Opportunities Commission also backed the call for 80 per cent pay. It added that it objected to the proposed link between maternity pay and sick pay. 'Pregnant women are not sick. If the Council of Ministers should decide to link maternity pay with sick pay, then . . . British women would end up with only about 25 per cent of the average full-time women worker's wage', it said. Not in Labour. Social Policy Section, NACAB, 115-123 Pentonville Rd, London N1 9LZ. Pounds 5.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed Rule 4.34(a)(5) would permit CTAs to include in a composite all accounts traded pursuant to the same trading program, provided that such a presentation would not be misleading and provided that the CTA describes how the composite was calculated. The term ``trading program'' would be defined in the rule as ``a trading strategy differentiated from others by commodity trading methodology, degree of risk or degree of leverage.'' Comment is requested as to the necessity and feasibility of providing a more detailed definition of the term ``trading program'' or additional guidance as to how trading programs can be differentiated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 8. Proprietary Trading Results  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Use of proprietary trading results in soliciting customer accounts is a practice which has long been of concern to the Commission. CPOs and CTAs may trade proprietary funds for a variety of purposes, including to test a new trading strategy before implementing it for customer funds or to establish a track record prior to trading customer funds. However, proprietary accounts may be traded in a different manner, for example, more aggressively, using higher leverage and assuming greater risk, than customer accounts. Also, proprietary accounts are usually not subject to the same fee schedule as customer accounts. Naturally, no management or incentive fee would apply where a CTA traded its own account, and clearing fees may be waived or reduced if the account is cleared by an affiliate. In addition, where proprietary and customer assets are combined for purposes of performance presentations, the total amount of assets under management is inflated and conceals the actual amount of customer funds being traded. For these reasons, proprietary trading results may, in many cases, be of little relevance to a prospective pool participant or CTA client and actually misleading in others.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Currently, the Commission's rules do not specifically address the use of proprietary trading results in disclosure documents. However, in reviewing disclosure documents, because the rules require performance of ``directed accounts'' and because of the prohibition against misleading disclosures, Division staff have advised that any proprietary trading results provided must be clearly labeled as such and presented in a separate table to reduce the potential for misleading investors. The staff also has required that if fees, expenses, commissions, margin-to-equity ratios, or any other item pertaining to the proprietary trading is materially different from that relevant to the trading program offered to clients, the registrant must ``pro forma'' such items to correspond to those in the program offered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In reviewing the Part 4 rules, the Commission considered prohibiting the use of proprietary results in CPO and CTA disclosure documents given the potentially misleading nature of such presentations and their at best marginal relevance in the non-proprietary trading context. However, the Commission is aware that proprietary trading results may be the only performance results available to some new traders to present to customers as evidence of trading experience. Accordingly, rather than prohibiting disclosure of proprietary trading results, the Commission is proposing to permit such disclosure under appropriate restrictions. Under proposed Rule 4.25(a)(9), pools and accounts in which the pool operator, trading manager, CTA or other person providing services to the pool owned or controlled fifty percent or more of the beneficial interest could not be included in disclosure documents unless prominently labeled as such and set forth following all required performance and non-performance disclosures. The requirement that proprietary results follow all required disclosures, rather than just the required performance disclosures, would reflect the peripheral and potentially misleading nature of proprietary trading results and reduce the potential for confusion of proprietary and customer trading results. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 36 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 36 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The NFA Special Committee also reached the conclusion that proprietary results should be displayed separately and labeled as such and that adjustments for fee differentials and other differences should be made.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 9. Pro Forma, Hypothetical and Extracted Results  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission also recognizes the potential for inappropriate use of certain other types of performance data. These include hypothetical, pro forma and extracted results. Hypothetical results are results calculated based upon the application of a given program to historical market prices and purport to present results that could have been obtained in trading a particular program during the specified historical period. Thus, hypothetical results are based on hindsight and can be readily manipulated. Rule 4.41 requires that any presentation of simulated or hypothetical trading results be accompanied by a specified cautionary statement describing the limited value of such results. In its rule submission, the NFA notes that a number of NFA disciplinary cases have involved NFA members who advertise hypothetical results to solicit unsophisticated customers. When the trading program is unsuccessful and causes substantial customer losses, the program is abandoned in favor of a new program for which hypothetical results, based on hindsight, are presented. The actual performance of customers whose accounts were traded under the prior program may never be disclosed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

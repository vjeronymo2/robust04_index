			<p><P> June 18, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> U.S. AGENCY RECOMMENDS LIST OF SPECIFIC PRECAUTIONS;  </P> <P> RISK OF TB EXPOSURE HIGHER AMONG INMATES  </P> <P> It was bad enough that Antti Haavisto coughed up blood in his prison cell all  night. He also had to listen to death threats from neighboring inmates kept  sleepless by his ceaseless hacking.  </P> <P> "Hurry up and die," convicts snarled through the steel bars inside Stillwater  Prison in eastern Minnesota. "Shut up or we'll shut you up."  </P> <P> Haavisto's lungs were being consumed by tuberculosis, which remained  undiagnosed through 11 visits to sick call over six months in 1982. Prison  doctors failed to spot the TB on two X-rays. Although Haavisto was coughing up  sputum with the consistency of sludge, the doctors told him he had emphysema or  pneumonia and gave him cough drops to ease the hacking.  </P> <P> "I thought I was going to die. I couldn't get air in, and I couldn't cough that  mud out. I almost drowned twice," said the wheezing Haavisto, a Finnish  immigrant convicted of manslaughter.  </P> <P> "Before I'd go to eat, I tried to cough up enough stuff so I didn't bother  anyone. I was afraid they would hate me and beat me up," Haavisto, 64, said in  an interview.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Still Contagious  </P> <P> Even after Haavisto was diagnosed and released from prison in May, 1983, the  airborne germ stalked the Stillwater cellblocks.  </P> <P> One year after Haavisto's diagnosis, the prisoner in the next cell came down  with TB. An outbreak occurred in 1984, when inmates sued the prison for  deficient medical care, and another rash of infections hit in 1986, when the  entire prison was finally tested.  </P> <P> Ultimately, one-third of the 1,200 inmates and at least five guards were  infected.  </P> <P> Tuberculosis is a bacterial lung disease once known as consumption because it  eats away lung tissue. Scientists estimate that 10 million Americans are  infected, but the vast majority will never get the disease.  </P> <P> TB is far worse in crowded prisons. Lawyers and inmate advocates say TB  outbreaks show what can happen when a contagious disease infects a closed  environment with antiquated ventilation systems and inattentive medical  watchdogs.  </P> <P> The incidence of TB among prisoners is more than triple the rate of those not  in jail, according to a May report by the federal Centers for Disease Control.  In New Jersey, the rate is 11 times higher for inmates; in California, six  times higher. New York prisons had a sevenfold increase in the disease in the  10-year period ending in 1986.  </P> <P> The CDC recommended these corrective measures for prisons: TB tests at least  once a year, quick X-rays for inmates showing symptoms and isolation of those  infected.  </P> <P> In Minnesota, federal Judge Diana Murphy said the handling of the epidemic by  prison officials and the state Department of Health "evidenced a lack of care  or reckless disregard for the medical needs of inmates."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Conditions Improved  </P> <P> In January, five years after the lawsuit was filed, she ruled that conditions  had improved and there was no need to order corrective actions.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, she severely criticized prison administrators, saying they  "passed off responsibility to (the) Department of Health, which assigned  responsibility to the doctors, who denied any role in managing the crisis other  than (in) providing primary care."  </P> <P> "It was a shocking case of negligence," said Stephen Miles of the University of  Chicago's Center for Clinical Medical Ethics. "Prisoners were not only  incarcerated but negligently exposed to a contagious disease."  </P> <P> "The prison became a pest hole of tuberculosis infection. Not only was there  neglect, prison officials turned a blind eye to known facts. There was  recklessness," said Arlo Vandevegte, attorney for the inmates who sued the  state.  </P> <P> Haavisto apparently brought the TB with him into Stillwater. On his trips to  sick call, he even suggested the medical staff check for TB.  </P> <P> "I told them I think I got some real bad problem. I couldn't talk. I couldn't  even make a phone call it was so bad," Haavisto said. "I said I got to get out  of this hole or I'm going to die in here."  </P> <P> Inmate Tony DeGidio contracted TB during the epidemic. His father caught it  when he came to the prison to visit Tony.  </P> <P> "You're trapped. You don't have a way out," DeGidio said. "We used to tell the  guards to do something. This guy's got a problem. Treat it or we're going to  treat it our way. Eliminate him."  </P> <P> Prison officials say treatment and tracking have improved.  </P> <P> "We don't have those problems now," said LeRoy Siegel, executive assistant to  Stillwater's warden. "We responded the way the so-called experts told us to."  </P></p>

			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Brussels to speed anti-trust probes THE European Commission is planning to speed long-winded anti-trust inquiries by introducing new internally binding deadlines. Sir Leon Brittan, competition commissioner, said yesterday that a new accelerated procedure for investigations into joint ventures would be introduced from next January 1 at the latest. Brussels competition authorities are also trying to accelerate state aid inquiries and are considering how to introduce public deadlines for other anti-trust cases, including investigations into cartels and abuses of a dominant position. As part of what Sir Leon described as a 'wide-ranging review of procedures', the Commission will commit itself to sending at least a preliminary opinion on joint venture cases to the companies involved within 'a few months'. Under 1990 rules, Commission inquiries into large EC mergers have to be completed within five months. If Brussels fails to meet the deadline then the merger has to be approved. But the speed of EC merger inquiries has only underlined the sluggishness of other investigations, which sometimes last for years rather than months. Sir Leon was addressing the Brussels-based Centre for European Policy Studies on the future of competition policy. He said he could 'conceive of no development, be it political or economic, that could change our view that (anti-competitive agreements) are contrary to the fundamental aims of the Treaty (of Rome)'. But he added that Community competition policy should remain flexible to changing circumstances. Looking ahead, Sir Leon said he believed many member states would find themselves obliged to reduce direct subsidies to business because of the constraints of European economic and monetary union.</p>

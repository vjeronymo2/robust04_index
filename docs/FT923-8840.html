			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / West vows to open up Serb camps: Britain and US look for alternative strategies to military intervention in Bosnia WESTERN governments vowed yesterday to take all possible measures to open up Serb-run detention camps in Bosnia-Hercegovina after an international outcry. However, the US, Britain and other European countries were desperately seeking ways to avoid being dragged into any kind of military intervention. Instead, they said they would seek to inspect detention camps holding Bosnian Moslems. The camps have been graphically depicted on British and US television in the past 24 hours. In Geneva, the US was trying to gain support to convene an emergency session of the United Nations Human Rights Commission to discuss alleged atrocities in Bosnia. President George Bush called for the conference on Thursday in response to mounting public pressure for the US to give a stronger lead on ending the fighting in Bosnia. In his second public statement on Bosnia in 24 hours, Mr Bush said he 'would not rest until each and every one of the camps has been visited by international inspectors'. His main aim appeared to be to deflect speculation on military action while emphasising his horror at conditions in the camps. 'The shocking brutality of genocide in World War Two, in those concentration camps, are burning memories for all of us, and that can't happen again,' he said. In London, the government also called for an emergency meeting of the UN Human Rights Commission to launch an investigation of the Serbian camps, echoing an earlier US call. Mr John Major said anyone involved in brutal behaviour in the detention camps would be brought to justice. 'Nobody who has seen these reports could be other than greatly concerned about them, and we are,' the prime minister said in Barcelona, where he is attending the Olympics. The UK called on Bosnia's Serbs to let qualified independent observers enter the camps before handing them over to UN control. Mr Major, who last night discussed the crisis with Mr Bush in a 20-minute phone call, said Britain had been looking at 'a whole series of options' in conjunction with European and Nato allies. Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, said Britain and 'our friends' were putting together a UN Security Council resolution that would include a call to collect information on abuses. Mr Hurd said if any detention camps continued, they should be placed under international supervision 'as soon as possible' and any abuses 'must be stopped'. In Paris, Mr Georges Kiejman, deputy foreign minister, said France wanted to increase the numbers and equipment of UN forces in Bosnia, and would try to alter their mandate to let them control the camps and protect aid convoys. All three governments continued to resist pressure for military intervention. Mr Bush warned against becoming embroiled in the Balkans, but said the US was considering use of force 'very carefully'. He said, in an apparent reference to the war in Vietnam: 'I do not want to see the US bogged down in any way into some guerrilla warfare. We've lived through that once.' Along with Mr Major, President Bush is reluctant to provide ground troops in Bosnia, but ultimately both leaders say they are prepared to provide military back-up for the international humanitarian relief effort. Humanitarian flights to Sarajevo airport were expected to resume early this morning after being suspended on Tuesday. Yugoslav PM orders closure of prison camps, Page 2 Balkan minefield, Page 6</p>

			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / Rail union to ballot its Tube members The executive of the RMT transport union yesterday decided to ballot London Underground workers on a series of one-day strikes over pay. The move followed a similar decision by Aslef, the train drivers' union, on Tuesday. The RMT's 8,000 members and Aslef's 2,000 drivers on London Underground will vote next month on whether to support a series of one-day stoppages in protest at an imposed 2 per cent pay rise. If Underground workers vote to strike their action could be co-ordinated with the stoppages by RMT rail signal staff working for Rail-track. Mr Jimmy Knapp, RMT general-secretary, said: 'Despite promises made by London Underground of a new dawn following the companycost-cutting programme introduced three years ago, Underground workers are still waiting.' The RMT announcement yesterday of a further 24-hour strike by Railtrack signal workers on September 8 means the action will take place during the annual Trades Union Congress, which is to be chaired by Mr Knapp.</p>

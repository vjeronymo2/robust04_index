			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Clarke rebuffs Blair on terrorism LABOUR's call for talks with the government aimed at re-establishing a bi-partisan approach to terrorism in Northern Ireland and mainland Britain was dismissed as a 'smokescreen' by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, in the Commons last night. Following his lead, Tory backbenchers repeatedly attacked Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, accusing him of giving encouragement to terrorism while criticising the government for not being tough enough in dealing with the general crime wave. Mr Clarke insisted there could be no justification for Labour MPs holding to the course they adopted in 1983 by voting against the annual order renewing the Prevention of Terrorism Act introduced by the last Labour government. At one point Mr Blair complained of 'barracking' by Tory MPs as he argued that independent advisers had recognised that there were fundamental objections to continuing the home secretary's powers to make orders excluding terrorist suspects from mainland Britain. Mr Blair also said there was widespread support for the view that a judge, and not the home secretary, should decide whether terrorist suspects could be detained by the police without any charge being made for more than four days. The Order to continue the Act's provisions for another year was approved by 329 to 202, a government majority of 127.</p>

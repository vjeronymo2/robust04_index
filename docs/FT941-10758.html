			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Equip us for competitiveness - What some smaller engineering companies told their Treasury guests Brian Lawson fingers a part the size of a napkin ring which his subcontracting company produces on two machine tools - it starts in one, moves across his cramped little factory to the other, and ends up back on the first to be finished. 'With the right sort of equipment I could make this cheaper on one machine,' says Lawson, owner of Canmore Engineering, based in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire. 'I'm competing with companies in Germany and Italy which have better equipment.' Canmore was one of 11 engineering companies in the home counties and the West Midlands which took part last week in a two-day event designed to show officials from the Treasury why investment in new technology by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) is vital to UK competitiveness as the country's recession ends. The event was a coup for the organisers, the Machine Tool Technologies Association, which for the first time managed to lure five senior Treasury officials from their desks to visit a crucial part of the UK industrial base. The businesses they visited were not 'poor companies bleating for hand-outs,' says the association's Mark Swift, 'but good companies that could do even better if it was easier for them to invest'. The tour followed a meeting late last year between the Treasury and the MTTA. 'We said: 'Let us take you to see the SMEs which are critical of the banks and the government,' so that officials could see what it is these businesses need to invest in new technology,' says Michael Legg, managing director of Japanese-owned Hitachi Seiki UK. A related aim, he says, was to show the Treasury how machine tools have changed over the past decade. The issue of competitiveness - and the disadvantages many SMEs believe they face when trying to win work against rivals in Europe and the Far East - dominated the tour. The clearing banks attracted considerable criticism - one defence supplier complained that its overdraft had been cut by one-third with no warning. The government came under attack too, with SMEs calling for the fine words about manufacturing over the past year or so to be matched by more action. The SMEs suggested a number of solutions ranging from a system of grants like the now discontinued Sefis (Small Engineering Firms' Investment Scheme), more generous capital allowances, or a government- sponsored scheme to channel stable, relatively low-cost finance to SMEs. Above all, the SMEs were looking for something from the government that would increase their confidence in making investments. Alan Addis, managing director of Southall-based Verdict Precision Engineering, says machine tool purchases by his French counterparts are heavily subsidised by their government, which then insists that large contractors use these suppliers. As for growing the company, Addis says: 'We've got some super plans and want to do so much. I need Pounds 1m to make Verdict really grow but where am I going to get it from?' Addis is particularly keen on seeing a revival for Sefis grants to encourage equipment purchases, although he says interest rates cannot be ignored either. Lawson, meanwhile, says that buying the latest high-tech equipment brings access to higher-margin work. Also, with aerospace customers likely to give big orders at short notice, 'you've got to have the equipment to make it on. There's no point in having 15-year-old machine tools'. And the reaction from the Treasury visitors? Bill Guy, head of its supply side unit, said the tour would not lead to an overnight change in policy, and seemed doubtful about some of the SMEs' proposals. But the trip would add to the 'quality of decision-making' at the Treasury.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The University of Illorin has been closed  indefinitely. This followed a peaceful demonstration by students  of the institution, demanding for the improvement of basic  amenities on the campus. A statement by the university  authorities today directed the students to vacate their campuses  by 4 o'clock in the afternoon [1500 GMT]. Our correspondent,  who visited the campuses, reports that the students have started  moving with their property out of their hostels, in compliance  to the order, while policemen have been drafted to ensure the  safety of life and property.</p>

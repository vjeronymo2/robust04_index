			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] New York (DPA) -- Germany advocates a "political  solution" in the Bosnian conflict, but at the same time it has  welcomed the NATO decision. It cannot be "considered as  retaliation or as the desire for military action." It is part  of a political process for a solution by negotiation. This was  stated by German UN Ambassador Detlev Count Rantzau on Monday  [14 February] at the emergency meeting of the UN Security  Council on Bosnia in New York. If the unauthorized weapons  systems have not been withdrawn within 10 days, the use of force  is "unavoidable" in reestablishing peace.    NATO has threatened to carry out air strikes on the Serbian  heavy weapons around Sarajevo if they are not withdrawn or put  under UN supervision by 21 February.    The German UN ambassador referred to the latest massacre of  innocent civilians in Sarajevo. "These crimes must stop,"  Rantzau demanded. Germany has made every effort to alleviate  the suffering of the victims. Almost 400,000 refugees have  found refuge in Germany, which is twice as many as in all other  European countries together. According to Rantzau, German  humanitarian aid amounts to 612 million marks. It is  unacceptable that the relief convoys are constantly hindered and  helpers are threatened and attacked.    According to the UN ambassador, the Federal Government  advocates a territorial solution, which ensures the physical and  political survival of the Muslims as a nation in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. This implies, above all, a "satisfactory  territorial solution," including access to the Sava river and to  the sea. The town of Mostar should be put under the  administration of the European Union. The German Government has  offered to provide an administrator for Mostar.    The UN ambassador noted that Bonn supports further close  cooperation between the United Nations and the European Union.  The German government also welcomes an "active, strong role" by  the United States. Russian support of the peace efforts will be  of great importance. The peace negotiations in Geneva will be  continued. They cannot be successful without the political will  of the three parties to the conflict. One cannot find a  political solution against their will. Germany will provide as  much support as possible toward the efforts for peace and  stability, the ambassador added.</p>

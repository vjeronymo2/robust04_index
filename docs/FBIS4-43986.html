			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Graham Brown] </F>   [Excerpt] Corfu, Greece, June 24 (AFP) -- Russia takes a  major step toward integration with Western Europe here Friday  [24 June] when President Boris Yeltsin signs an historic  partnership and cooperation agreement with the European Union  [EU].    The signing ceremony opens a two-day EU summit at which the  12-nation bloc will also formally sign up new members Austria,  Finland, Norway and Sweden -- its first enlargement since Spain  and Portugal entered in 1986.    Speaking on his arrival at this Mediterranean island on  Thursday, Yeltsin thanked the EU for leading the way in "ending  the discrimination" traditionally accorded to Russia. He said  Moscow and Brussels were becoming "equal partners."    The agreement will greatly increase Russian trade access to  the EU, open up the prospect of a Russia-EU free trade zone  after 1998 and provide for wide-ranging political dialogue.    It is the latest in a flurry of initiatives to bolster  reform  in Russia by binding it more closely to western political,  economic and military institutions.    Two weeks ago Russia signed a cooperation agreement with the  Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).    On Wednesday it joined the North Atlantic Treaty  Organisation's partnership for peace programme of military  cooperation with the countries of the former Soviet bloc.    And next month Yeltsin will join in political consultations  of the G-7 group of industrialised nations -- the United States,  Japan, Canada, Britain, France, Germany and Italy -- at a summit  in Naples, Italy.

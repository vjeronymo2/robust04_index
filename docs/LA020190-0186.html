			<p><P> February 1, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GOVERNOR LETS FAMILY CLINICS BILL BECOME LAW  </P> <P> Bowing to pressure from fellow Republicans, Gov. George Deukmejian on Wednesday  allowed a $20-million family-planning bill to become law without his signature,  thus avoiding a veto override attempt and dousing a smoldering political issue.  </P> <P> The bill, passed overwhelmingly by both the Senate and Assembly despite  Deukmejian's veto threats, restores $20 million of the $24 million that the  governor cut last July from the Legislature's proposed $36-million funding  package for private, nonprofit family-planning clinics.  </P> <P> Before the cuts, the 500 clinics annually served 470,000 people -- most of them  poor women -- providing such services as birth-control advice and  prescriptions, Pap smears to detect cervical cancer, breast exams, screening  for sexually transmitted diseases and testing for the AIDS virus.  </P> <P> More than 31,000 low-income women in Orange County use family-planning  agencies, according to the local chapter of Planned Parenthood.  </P> <P> "It's tough to rationalize going to war over this issue," said Senate  Republican Leader Ken Maddy of Fresno upon hearing of the governor's action. He  echoed the sentiments of most GOP legislators.  </P> <P> Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) said Deukmejian's decision showed that  the conservative governor was facing considerable opposition from his  colleagues in the Republican Party.  </P> <P> "It shows that Republicans are not just cardboard, cookie-cutter  conservatives," said Bergeson, who voted for the restoration of the  family-planning funds. "The governor was faced with a difficult decision, with  such strong support from conservative factions as well as moderate factions."  </P> <P> "Yahoo!" exclaimed Norma K. Clevenger, a lobbyist for Planned Parenthood. "Can  you believe it? The governor is finally paying attention to the support for  family-planning programs from the public, from the Legislature and from the  Republican Party."  </P> <P> Officials with family-planning agencies in Orange County agreed, suggesting  that it marked an important shift.  </P> <P> Barbara Jackson, public affairs director for Planned Parenthood of Orange and  San Bernardino counties, said she and others were pleased that Deukmejian  "finally acknowledged the broad-based support for family planning in  California."  </P> <P> "I don't think it was an easy decision for the Republicans to make," Jackson  added. "I'm impressed that they would give the governor that message and that  he would acknowledge it."  </P> <P> Deukmejian seemed to go through a long, complex maze of conflicting thought  processes before arriving at his decision on Wednesday, the final day that he  could sign or veto the measure without it becoming law without his signature.  </P> <P> Early last year, the governor worried about the clinics promoting abortion.  More important in his view, he said he felt that the state could not afford the  programs. Later he twice indicated a willingness to compromise. But recently he  was irked by a court challenge to his authority to cut the funds. And he  decided he did not care much for the programs anyway.  </P> <P> In the end, Deukmejian looked into a political abyss and flinched, though  somewhat defiantly. Republicans -- including the likely GOP gubernatorial  nominee, U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson -- had pressured him to restore the money,  fearing that Republicans could be tagged with being insensitive to poor women  and also become vulnerable to the attacks of abortion-rights activists.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Spirit of Cooperation  </P> <P> "I am willing to yield to the majority of the Legislature on this bill to  relieve them of a potentially prolonged and difficult process and to continue  to maintain the spirit of cooperation between the Legislature and the  governor," Deukmejian said in a prepared statement, referring indirectly to  compromises on several other major issues that he had negotiated with lawmakers  last year. That spirit of good-will recently has been threatened by the  simmering fight over family-planning funds.  </P> <P> Although Deukmejian backed away from his objections to the family-planning  programs, he sternly declared that "I am steadfast in my commitment to maintain  the fiscal health of state government." Therefore, the governor said, he  expects the Legislature "to act in a fiscally responsible manner" and reduce  other programs in the next state budget to make up for the added  family-planning expenditures. He placed these costs at $44 million -- $20  million during the current fiscal year and $24 million in the next.  </P> <P> Deukmejian adamantly defended his action in vetoing the funds in the first  place, declaring that those and other cuts "were proven to be essential" to  provide a reserve for "unanticipated expenditures, such as the (Bay Area)  earthquake."  </P> <P> The lame-duck governor insisted that he was confident that if he had vetoed the  bill, he would have escaped his first veto override. GOP lawmakers would have  supported him, he said. While this seemed to be a correct analysis of the  situation, Republicans wanted to avoid a Democrat-led override attempt that  would focus more public attention on the volatile issue.  </P> <P> "I was very pleased with his decision because it would permit the Legislature  to focus on the important issues that we need to address, specifically the  budget," said Sen. John Seymour (R-Anaheim). "Had we gone through a  veto-override attempt, we would have been expending energy and time focusing on  that instead of the budget."  </P> <P> Noting that negotiators had achieved compromises in the bill that "satisfied an  overwhelming majority" of Republican lawmakers, Deukmejian said he decided  against vetoing the measure "in order to put this issue behind us and to enable  us to go forward with the ambitious agenda that I have outlined in my recent  State of the State Address."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Wilson Is Relieved  </P> <P> Nobody was more relieved with Deukmejian's action then Sen. Wilson, who  describes himself as "pro-choice" on abortion and did not relish the prospect  of defending the governor's action this year while campaigning for his job. "We  recognize that Gov. Deukmejian is a man of conviction, but we also recognize  that some resolution of this matter was needed," said a Wilson adviser, who  asked not to be identified. "We think the conclusion he reached was a good  one."  </P> <P> Deukmejian made no mention in his statement of the lawsuit, now pending in the  state Supreme Court, that challenges a governor's right to use his "blue  pencil" to veto money for family planning. The governor previously had fretted  that to restore the money now would make it seem as if he were surrendering to  the plaintiffs and setting a bad precedent.  </P> <P> A Deukmejian adviser, speaking anonymously, said Wednesday that the governor  now expects the plaintiffs to drop the suit. "But if they want to pursue the  case, we'll pursue it; we're very confident," he said.  </P> <P> Times staff writers Jerry Gillam, Carl Ingram, Ralph Frammolino and Eric Bailey  contributed to this story.  </P></p>

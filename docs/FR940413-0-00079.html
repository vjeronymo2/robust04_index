			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The requirement to consult with certain groups and individuals, and the requirement to provide public participation in the development of the allocation plan is to assist the PHA in better identifying issues, problems, and benefits involved in the proposed action. However, the final decision concerning the project to be designated, and how the PHA proposes to allocate its available housing resources rests with the PHA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Submission of Summary of Comments, and Not Transcripts <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The final rule continues to allow PHAs to submit a summary of comments received on the allocation plan. A few commenters stated that submission of a summary of the comments is in conflict with the statutory requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The statute provides, in relevant part, that the allocation plan shall include ``any comments of agencies, organizations or persons with whom the PHA consults.'' The Department believes that the statutory language is sufficiently broad to permit submission of a summary of the comments received on the allocation plan. The PHA must maintain the original comments on file, and must make these comments available for inspection by the Department and the public.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other commenters stated that the proposed rule was unclear whether transcripts of meetings were required, and if transcripts were required, the commenters stated that this requirement is too burdensome. In referring to transcripts of meetings in the proposed rule, the Department did not intend to require a transcript of a meeting. Rather, the proposed rule intended to require retention of a transcript if a PHA decided to have a transcript made of a meeting. The final rule, however, removes all references to meeting transcripts. If taken, the PHA should maintain the transcript on file, together with comments received on the allocation plan, to be made available for inspection by the public. Comments made at a meeting by members of the public should be included in the summary of comments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Retention of Five Year Recordkeeping Requirement for Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several comments complained that the five year recordkeeping requirement for the retention of comments submitted on the allocation plan was too lengthy a period. The commenters suggested that a two-year retention period should be sufficient.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department disagrees with the commenters. PHAs should maintain the original comments received on the allocation plan to cover at least two biennial updates. The Department believes that the five-year record retention period is in the best interest of PHAs, and is not unduly burdensome.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Removal of Requirement To Discuss Advantages and Disadvantages of Designation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The final rule removes the requirement for the PHA to address in the allocation plan the advantages and disadvantages that the choice of designation is expected to have on families served by the PHA. The Department agrees with the commenters that the advantages and disadvantages should be apparent by the information provided in the allocation plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Retention of Requirement To Document the Number of Families Who Will Be Denied or Delayed Housing <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A few commenters requested that the final rule not include the statutory requirements for PHAs to ``document the number and duration of instances in which housing assistance for eligible applicants will be denied or delayed by the agency because of a lack of appropriately designated units.'' The Department declines to remove this requirement from the rule because it is a statutory requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Clarification That Delays of Concern Are Those That Are Caused by the Designation Process <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In response to public comment, the final rule clarifies that the denial of or delay in housing assistance with which the Department is concerned in part 945 is that which results from the designation of project. Delays that are caused by matters unrelated to the designation process are not those that will result in re-evaluation of the appropriateness of a PHA's designation of a project. For example, as one commenter noted, some PHAs have very low turn-over in their projects that results in denial of or delay in housing assistance that is unrelated to the designation process. Also, a PHA that implements stricter screening procedures can be expected to have an increased rate of denial of housing assistance among all applicants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Determining the Extent of Denial of or Delay in Housing Assistance <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters indicated that they were uncertain what the statute meant by ``excessive,'' and requested the Department define ``excessive'' in terms of a number or percentage. Instead of defining this term, the Department has replaced ``excessive'' with ``substantial.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As discussed in the previous section, there may be a variety of circumstances having nothing to do with the designation of housing that may give rise to delays in housing assistance. The Department is interested in knowing whether the designation of project under part 945 is causing a denial of or delay in housing assistance for a substantial number of tenants. That is, has the number of applicants denied housing assistance increased as a result of the designation, or (or perhaps also) has there been an increase (a lengthening) in the duration of time an applicant must wait for housing assistance as a result of the designation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Revision to Requirement To Maintain Access to Similar Services and Housing Facilities <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule required PHAs to describe the steps to be taken to ensure that disabled families (if a project was to be designated for elderly families) and elderly families (if a project was to be designated for disabled families) maintain access to services and housing facilities similar to those that otherwise would have been available to them at the project if the project had not been designated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A number of commenters objected to this requirement on the basis that the regulatory language was too broad, and it would be impossible for PHAs to guarantee similar access to all services and amenities available to them before designation. The Department agrees with the commenters, and has revised this section of the allocation plan. The rule now requires PHAs to describe the steps taken to facilitate access to supportive services provided by other agencies at the designated project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

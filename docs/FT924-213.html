			<p>921230 FT  30 DEC 92 / Fall in chip sales to Japan spurs trade fears THE Japanese government announced yesterday that the foreign share of the country's semiconductor market declined from 16 per cent to 15.9 per cent during the third quarter, increasing the probability of renewed trade friction with the US. Under a US-Japan semiconductor pact, Tokyo agreed to a target of 20 per cent foreign share by the end of this year, but the decline has put this goal out of reach and means that chips may be the first item on the trade agenda of President-elect Bill Clinton. After the foreign share surged from 14.6 per cent to 16 per cent during the second quarter, the Japanese government hoped the year-end figure would be close to 20 per cent, while the US industry applauded the increase as a 'step in the right direction'. A Japanese electronics company official suggested that the sharp fall in profits at most electronics makers is behind the decline. These companies have begun using more of their own chips and encouraging long-time customers to increase their purchases, limiting opportunities for foreign chips. The US government has warned that it will take 'additional actions, as necessary, to fulfil' the chip agreement, which superseded a pact signed in 1986 and was accepted by Japan to placate the politically-influential US semiconductor industry. Japan has its own formula for calculating market share, which includes chips made by Japanese companies, but sold under foreign brands, and chips shipped by US producers to subsidiaries in Japan. Under that formula, generally ignored by the US, foreign share fell to 17.7 per cent from 17.9 per cent during the third quarter. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti) said it hoped 'the share of foreign chips will rise' in the final quarter.</p>

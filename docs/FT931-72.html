			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / International Capital Markets: OMLX plans trade in both securities and derivatives MR LYNTON Jones, chief executive of OM London, the Swedish-owned equity options exchange, yesterday outlined an ambitious programme for broadening the scope of the exchange to include securities as well as derivative products. The exchange 'is well placed to capitalise on the coming together of cash and derivative markets', Mr Jones said, as it has the technical capacity as well as regulatory approval as a recognised investment exchange in the UK. As a first step, it changed its name, effective today, to OMLX, The London Securities and Derivatives Exchange. But the drive to establish itself as an international equity-based exchange trading both securities and derivatives is likely to be difficult. in an increasingly competitive trading environment. The most radical plan is to resurrect the Unlisted Securities Market (USM), a market for small UK stocks, using the exchange's sophisticated computer trading system. The London Stock Exchange (LSE), which has recommended phasing out the USM by 1995, is studying responses to its consultative document on the USM and is expected to make a statement soon. The City Group for Smaller Companies (Cisco) plans to produce its own recommendation by the end of May. But Mr Jones also called for a transfer of responsibility for listing stocks from the LSE to an independent body such as the Securities and Investments Board. This would be closer to the system in the US, where companies have to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and would improve the chances of success for a new unlisted securities market. The other area of securities trading targeted by OMLX is the Swedish stock market. International trading in Swedish shares is concentrated on Seaq International. But, with a strong international base in Swedish equity options trading, OMLX is considering offering a rival service. In the derivatives area, the exchange plans to diversify its contract base through linkages with other exchanges, a process already underway, and by developing new derivative contracts. But it will avoid competing directly with Liffe. OMLX may try to fill some of the gaps left by Liffe's products, such as long-dated options, or flavour-of-the-month options - identifying stocks currently of interest due to bids or takeover battles.</p>

			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / German recession reaches Deutsche Deutsche Bank's 11 per cent increase in operating profits for the 10 months ended October to DM4.2bn (Pounds 1.66bn) came exclusively from foreign operations, Mr Hilmar Kopper, chairman said yesterday. Record group-wide risk provisions of almost DM2.5bn, up 54 per cent on last year, led to a fall in earnings at the German-based parent of 9 per cent to DM2.36bn, he said. Some 90 per cent of the provisions, which he expected to rise to almost DM3bn for the full year, were to cover domestic risks. The German recession had now caught up with the banks, Mr Kopper told a press conference, and its effects would continue to be felt in the new year. Providing for risks was a 'recession barometer, and right now it is showing a storm warning,' he declared. The cyclical and structural crisis had had a serious impact on the credit-worthiness and income of Deutsche's domestic customers, Mr Kopper warned. 'As the house bank to thousands of small and medium-sized companies, we are feeling the effects of this,' he said. The bottom of the industrial recession had been reached. 'But the bad news is that we will stay quite a while at this low point,' he added. Deutsche, Germany's biggest private sector bank, also holds 10 per cent or more of the equity of 25 leading non-banking companies, worth almost DM24bn, according to details released for the first time yesterday. These holdings include 10.65 per cent in Metallgesellschaft, the metals, mining and engineering group.</p>

			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / Sixty days in the wilderness IN THE driving icy rain Abdul Rahim Wajeh Quas gazed longingly south at the rugged snow-capped mountains marking the border between Israel and Lebanon. 'I have never seen my first son who was born six weeks ago and I hope God will protect him and allow me to go home soon so I can hold him in my arms,' he said. Mr Quas, a student from Nablus in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, is among 396 Palestinians who were arrested last December by the Israeli Shin Bet internal security service, bundled into buses and shoved over the border at gunpoint into Lebanon. He first heard about the birth of his son from Palestinian radio broadcasting from neighbouring Syria. Today the 396 men, including 22 university lecturers, 14 engineers and 11 doctors, start their 60th day stranded in a makeshift tented camp in a bleak no-man's land in southern Lebanon. Their treatment by the Israeli government will dog this week's visit to the Middle East by Mr Warren Christopher, the first foreign tour by the new US Secretary of State. Resumption of the suspended peace talks may hinge on whether Mr Christopher can hammer out a compromise on the crisis acceptable to Israel, Arab leaders, the Palestine Liberation Organisation and the expelled Palestinians themselves. Cut off from outside assistance in their muddy hillside camp of canvas and plastic sheeting, the deportees are kept alive with food smuggled through Lebanese army checkpoints by sympathetic journalists and local villagers. Despite the rain and melting snow, and the scorpions which live under the boulders around the camp, the morale of the expelled Palestinians is high. Wrapped up in kafiyehs (headscarves) and woollen balaclavas they say they are determined to stay put on their rain-lashed hillside until Israel concedes the right of all of them to return home immediately, as laid out in UN resolution 799 adopted unanimously the day after they were banished. Above their squalid tented village flies a blue flag with a slogan from the Koran in Arabic: 'Victory of God is coming soon.' Israel claims that the exiled men, originally numbering 415, are members of the shadowy, militant Islamic resistance movement Hamas, whose military wing, Qassam, has been responsible for a spate of recent attacks against Israeli soldiers. Hamas opposes the Middle East peace process, refuses to recognise Israel's existence and is banned by the government. None of the expelled Palestinians openly admit membership of Hamas - a 'crime' punishable under Israeli law by imprisonment. But they are all sympathetic, in varying degrees, to the organisation. Mr Abdul Aziz al-Rantisi, the leader of the expelled Palestinians, was a founding member of Hamas. He is direct in his criticism of Israeli policies in the occupied territories. 'The Israelis are killing us with machine guns. We are defending ourselves with stones. That is our God-given right.' Not all of the 396 Palestinians are so political. At least 80 have never been arrested, interrogated or even warned by Israeli security. Mr Faris Abu-Mouamer, the 35-year-old dean of the faculty of commerce at the Islamic University in Gaza, returned to Gaza in 1989 after completing his five-year doctoral thesis in business administration at the University of Wales, Cardiff. He says he never had time to get involved in politics, concentrating instead on his academic career and private business. 'I never supported any political party,' he said in Welsh accented English. 'I thought that any group fighting to liberate our occupied land was right and I didn't care how.' A month before he was expelled his brother was shot dead by Israeli soldiers as he was returning from the funeral of a distant family member who Mr Abu-Mouamer said had been active in the resistance. He consulted lawyers and planned to protest his brother's death in the courts. 'That was the only thing I ever did against the government,' he said. 'I never wanted to be a martyr, now I am forced to be one.' There are some mutterings of a compromise in the ranks of the deportees. But their spokesmen say nothing short of full implementation of UN resolution 799 will be acceptable. They, and the PLO, have rejected a US-brokered Israeli offer to take back 96 of the remaining exiles and to reduce to up to one year the term of exile for the rest. 'Our only crime is that we said to the Israelis 25 years of occupation is enough,' said Mr Aziz Dweik, a professor of geography at Nablus University who was detained twice for political activities. 'Please let us and our children live free lives.' US pressure for talks, Page 4</p>

			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / People: ICI split makes waves When a company like ICI, Britain's biggest manufacturer, splits itself in two, the shock waves are felt well beyond the boardrooms of Ronnie Hampel's slimmed down ICI and David Barnes' Zeneca. It is easy to spot the winners at board level. Alan Pink (above left) 54-year-old chief executive of ICI's agrochemicals and seeds business, for example, has gone on to the Zeneca board. He is the only one of the eight chief executives of ICI's traditional core businesses to get a directorship as a result of the demerger. Rob Margetts, 46, who had been chief executive of ICI's Tioxide business until six months ago, had already got a main board seat. But given that the rest of his colleagues are in their late fifties, he would seem a front-runner to take over from Ronnie Hampel who is little more than a year away from ICI's normal retirement age of 62. Three of ICI's four general managers are staying with the old firm - Victor White, 56, group solicitor; Alan Spall, 48, finance; and Trevor Harrison, 53, planning. However, ICI personnel boss Hugh Donaldson, 51, joins Zeneca as general manager of corporate resources, along with Norman Lyle, 45, finance; and Graeme Musker, 40, secretary. Michael Deeley, chairman of the separately quoted ICI Australia, keeps the same job unlike most of ICI's other regional chairmen around the globe. ICI Europe has been disbanded and its chairman, David Benyon, retired last September. Ben Lochtenberg remains chairman of ICI America but is close to retirement. Meanwhile, Keith Willard, president of ICI Canada, has been appointed chairman of Zeneca in North America. Paul Schindler, the Frenchman who was ICI's chairman of Asia Pacific, has been made chairman of ICI (China) and Dr S Lui has been appointed chairman of Zeneca in China. He takes on additional regional responsibilities from August. Finally, there are still some non-executive directorships to fill. Gill Lewis (above right) 48, Nestles head of personnel, has just been appointed to the Zeneca board, but the old ICI needs to recruit at least one more non-executive director if it wants to maintain its traditional balance between execs and non-execs.</p>

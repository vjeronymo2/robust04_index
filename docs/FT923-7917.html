			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russia strives to boost grain supply THE RUSSIAN government plans to reorganise its grain procurement system as part of attempts to encourage peasants to hand over more supplies to the state. Mr Leonid Cheshinsky, chairman of the government grain procurement committee, reported yesterday that the state had met only 25 per cent of its 29.1m tonne target for this year. He said it was likely that the government would only be able to secure a total of 24.5m tonnes as 12 grain producing regions had unilaterally reduced the amount they planned to sell. As a result, President Boris Yeltsin is to sign a decree making sales to the state compulsory only for regions which produce surplus grain beyond their own needs, absolving those which only break even or produce less grain than they need. Mr Cheshinsky said this would mean doing away with the old system, whereby all grain-producing regions had to sell grain to the state, which would then send some back to them. He said Russia would import an estimated 20m tonnes, including 3m tonnes from Kazakhstan. He forecast the Russian grain harvest this year at 94m-96m. On Tuesday, the government raised its purchase price for lower quality grain from Rbs10,000 to Rbs12,000 a tonne, in an attempt to increase procurement levels. Mr Cheshinsky said however this would aggravate the crisis in livestock and poultry breeding. The government has allocated 20,000 military trucks to help move the harvest off farms. The Ukrainian government, anxious to fill state granaries, has threatened to halt subsidies to farms that refuse to sell grain to the state, reports Reuter from Kiev. The government said it had succeeded in purchasing just 8m tonnes of grain so far this year out of a required 17m.</p>

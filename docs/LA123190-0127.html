"I certainly felt a little out of it."  </P> <P> Garrison was returning to tennis after a monthlong vacation. "I'm only just  getting back into the flow of tennis after not playing since the Virginia Slims  championship a month ago," she said.  </P> <P> The United States will face the Swiss team of Jakob Hlasek and Manuela  Maleeva-Fragniere in the semifinals on Wednesday.  </P> <P> Akiko Kijimuta of Japan beat comeback-minded Pam Shriver 6-4, 6-2 today in the  first round of the Danone Open at Brisbane, Australia.  </P> <P> Kijimuta repeatedly hit passing shots past Shriver, playing her first  tournament in nine months after undergoing surgery on her right shoulder.  </P> <P> Shriver, once the third-ranked player in the world and the winner of 21 Grand  Slam doubles titles during her 13-year professional career, said she wasn't  downhearted by the loss. "My comeback is a 12- to 18-month project," she said.  </P> <P> At Adelaide, Australia, second-seeded Jim Courier of Dade City, Fla., beat  Alexander Mronz of Germany 3-6, 6-2, 6-1 in the first round of the Australian  Hardcourt tennis championship.  </P></p>

			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / World Trade News: Farmers want Beregovoy to resist subsidy cuts FRENCH farmers are confident that despite his faith in free markets, Mr Pierre Beregovoy, France's new prime minister, will resist pressure for deep cuts in farm subsidies to unblock the stalled Gatt world trade talks, Reuter reports from Paris. 'Beregovoy is more sensitive to pressure from industrial and financial circles than (former Premier Edith) Cresson, but there is no reason to fear a shift in position on Gatt,' an official of FNSEA, the main French farmers' union, said. France, as the EC's biggest farm producer and exporter, holds the key to farm reform. The reappointment of Mr Louis Mermaz as farm minister is seen as a sign that Paris plans to continue to resist any new concessions in the Gatt talks. The April 22 meeting between US President George Bush and Mr Jacques Delors, EC president, is seen as one of the last chances for a breakthrough in the deadlocked talks. French farmers see more need to worry about talks under way to reform the EC's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), which they fear could lead to production quotas.</p>

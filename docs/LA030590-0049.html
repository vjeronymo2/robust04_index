			<p><P> March 5, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> BAKERSFIELD;  </P> <P> WORKER MAY HAVE SWALLOWED PESTICIDE  </P> <P> A farm worker who died while spraying an almond orchard apparently swallowed  some of the pesticide parathion, according to the Kern County coroner's office.  An autopsy on Jose Campos Martinez, 25, revealed he had an "appreciable  quantity" of the pesticide in his stomach, but not in his vital organs,  indicating he must have swallowed the poison and not ingested it through his  skin or nostrils. Campos, who lived in Wasco, fell dead in an orchard near Lost  Hills on Jan. 20.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by 'Aqiva Eldar: "The Fourth Side"] </F>   [Text] A visitor from the moon stumbling upon the latest  issue of the FOREIGN AFFAIRS magazine might think the Middle  East is a major inducer of insomnia among Washington  decisionmakers.    Writing in the magazine, National Security Adviser Anthony  Lake says that ever since the end of the Cold War, the only  superpower has been apprehensive about the potential damage from  five countries which choose to remain outside the international  community and to assail its basic values. Three of these --  Iran, Iraq, and Libya -- grace the Middle East with their  presence. (The other two are Cuba and North Korea.)    Lake's article focuses on the advantages of the U.S.  strategy  vis-a-vis the Iraqi and Iranian threats, known as "dual  containment." Lake illuminates Israel's role in the era of  peace as assigned by the United States. The strategic  cooperation has lost the Soviet enemy, but Israel shall not  stand alone. According to Lake, Israel, along with the other  U.S. allies in the region -- Egypt, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia --  permit the United States to simultaneously contain the Iranians  and the Iraqis. Thanks to Israel and the other U.S. friends in  the region, the United States can afford to forgo the dubious  satisfaction of cooperating with the devil against a greater  devil.    By the way, the same magazine carries an article by Prof.  Gregory Gause from the Columbia University, who presents the  theory of those who doubt the logic of dual containment. He  suggests seeking channels to Tehran while intensifying the  pressure on the peace process participants, in order to foil the  Tehran efforts to torpedo the process.    The timing of the publication of the National Security  Council official's contemplations can hardly be accidental. The  weight of his observations differs from that of the lecture on  the dual containment policy delivered by his assistant, Martin  Indyk, in May 1993. Lake insinuates the peace process dimension  into the depth of strategic analysis: Peace between Israel and  its neighbors, the senior adviser opines, will deprive Iraq of  occasions to exploit the Palestinian suffering and divest Iran  of the capability to cultivate chaos in Lebanon. Lakes is  careful -- possibly fearing Israeli reaction -- not to include  Syria in his vision of the Middle East coalition, although his  remarks plainly reveal that his desire to move Syria away from  Iran is as great as his aspiration to draw it close to Israel.    The United States will have to convince the Arab countries  --  the moderates and those on their way to becoming moderate --  that the quadruple coalition will not threaten them or offer  them formulas that will tempt them to cooperate, in exchange for  overt and active support for the peace process; at the same  time, President Clinton will have to pledge assistance to Israel  toward reducing risks inherent in a compromise with the Arabs.    All this offers Israel an opportunity -- perhaps unique --  to  take advantage of its special relationship with an  administration which waives a priori the option of playing the  game with two elements hostile to Israel and which mobilizes all  its strength and influence for the sake of uniformly  neutralizing all those who reject conciliation with Israel.    Since the end of the Cold War, Israel and its friends in the  United States have been searching for a new footing on which the  strategic cooperation -- the source of many important advantages  in the sphere of defense and public relations -- can be  established. Israel's becoming a frontline deterrent base  against Iran and Iraq, and if necessary, a base for military  action against them, requires a revaluation of the "dual  containment" approach. If the Americans manage to create a  Middle East NATO after the conflict between Israel and its  neighbors is resolved, a new Middle East balance of power will  have to be established. The new alliance will justify a  generous supply of state-of-the-art technologies, weapons, and  intelligence to Israel to ensure its deterrence vis-a-vis Syria.    Along with the above, we can expect the U.S. Navy to deploy  a  floating power off the Middle East shores and to create new jobs  in Israel for the benefit of the U.S. troops and equipment.  This handsome package, along with the blessing inherent in the  termination of the war with Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon, must be  weighed against the advantages stemming from retaining control  over the Golan Heights.    The introduction of the peace process in the context of dual  containment demands that the U.S. President pull out of the  narrow labyrinth of the desire to gratify Israel -- in fact, the  Jewish constituency -- at almost any cost. If U.S. weakness  contributes to the failure of the peace process, the writings of  the most senior national security adviser will become a national  indictment against Clinton.</p>

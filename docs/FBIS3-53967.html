[Darawshah] Thank you my brother. Greetings to you and to  everyone at the Voice of the Arabs.    [Al-Jundi] The ball is now in the Israeli court, and there  is  a proposal from Yitzhaq Rabin to hold a referendum among the  Israeli people regarding withdrawal from the Golan Heights after  reaching agreement with the Syrians. Could you inform us about  the current viewpoint inside the Israeli Knesset and the  Government?    [Darawshah] The summit between al-Asad and Clinton has  greatly affected the political arena inside Israel, be it in  government, the Knesset, or among the public. Everyone has  become occupied with the meeting, especially President al-Asad's  statements regarding his readiness to realize the peace of the  brave--one that guarantees a just and comprehensive peace--and  to fully normalize relations. In other words, full withdrawal  in return for full peace. This is what the Israeli Government  demanded previously. It claimed that the extent of an Israeli  withdrawal corresponds to the depth of peace that Syria  proposes. Clearly, President al-Asad has presented a wise  proposal, one that stunned the world and gathered international  support. But it has also caused some embarrassment to the  Israeli Government and Yitzhaq Rabin. In the past two days,  Rabin proposed something that we, as supporters of peace and  people who want to boost the peace process, reject. Rabin  proposed holding a popular referendum after agreeing on a draft  agreement with Syria. In other words, the Syrian negotiators  will sit at a table with the Israeli negotiators knowing  beforehand that any agreement they reach must be approved by  Israeli public opinion, which could change according to the  prevailing atmosphere.    [Al-Jundi] So, this agreement between the government and  Syria could change if the people reject it?    [Darawshah] Rabin stated that the agreement with Syria will  lead to a big withdrawal from the Golan Heights. He did not  specify its extent but said there will be a big withdrawal and  sacrifice. So, such a step requires going back to the people for  a referendum in which they will express their opinion. I  believe this is stalling, a postponement, especially when viewed  together with Israeli reaction to the joint statement and the  Syrian president's stance, which was dry; it was not  sufficiently expressive. We hoped Prime Minister Rabin and  Foreign Minister Peres would have adopted a more flexible  position showing greater acceptance of the Syrian stance  announced by President al-Asad during his meeting with President  Clinton.    [Al-Jundi] But some believe Rabin is trying to appease  Israeli extremists and Jewish settlers in the Golan.    [Darawshah] It is, indeed, an attempt to calm the situation.  But deep down, Rabin realizes that any peace agreement with  Syria must lead to a full withdrawal of Israeli forces and  settlers from the Syrian Golan. He knows it. I believe most  Israelis realize that it is unavoidable. But given the  opposition to such a step by the rightists, the settlers, the  Likud, and other right-wing members of the Knesset, Rabin is  trying to find ways to pacify opponents, such as the referendum  proposition. But I believe Rabin knows full well that if he  wants peace with Syria, he must pull out completely from the  Golan and leave it to its motherland, Syria.    [Al-Jundi] Through your contacts with parliamentary blocs in  the Israeli Knesset, how much support is there for an Israeli  withdrawal from the Golan?    [Darawshah] I believe that if the Knesset and the Israeli  public in general are offered a draft agreement between Syria  and Israel based on a complete withdrawal of the Israeli forces  and settlers from the Golan in return for a full  peace--including the exchange of ambassadors, economic  cooperation, security arrangements, water agreement, and a  peaceful strategy--the majority will support it. Rabin  apparently realizes this but wants to pave the way through the  referendum idea.    [Al-Jundi] I understand from this that for Rabin, it is only  a matter of time and that the withdrawal will inevitably come.    [Darawshah] Rabin is known to be a cautious politician. He  analyzes positions and moves slowly and gradually. He is doing  this with the Palestinians now. He did it with the Jordanians.  With Syria too, he wants to move gradually and prepare the  public for difficult decisions. For the Israelis, withdrawal  from the Golan is a difficult decision and Rabin knows it. So,  he is preparing for this withdrawal through proposals, delays,  and procrastination. But sooner or later, a full Israeli  withdrawal from the Syrian Golan and from all occupied Arab  territories is unavoidable. Rabin realizes that Syria is very  important if the general Arab-Israeli conflict is to be solved.    [Al-Jundi] Thank you.    [Darawshah] You are welcome.</p>

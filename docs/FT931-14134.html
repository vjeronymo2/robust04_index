			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / Observer: Straw man Britain's Labour party desperately needs an injection of new ideas, but it is hard to believe that Jack Straw's thoughts on the monarchy, however revolutionary, should be given top billing. Much more interesting would be to hear Straw's ideas on how to shake up the appalling education system in England and Wales, a task he failed to address properly during his four-year stint as shadow education secretary. Unless Labour can come up with some sensible ideas on how to improve education, raise the standard of public services and tackle poverty - without doubling taxes - it'll never have a hope of tidying up the monarchy.</p>

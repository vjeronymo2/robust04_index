			<p><P> August 3, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEIGHBORHOOD PROFILE: NEWPORT TERRACE: FOCUS;  </P> <P> NEIGHBORHOOD'S TALE IS OF TWO CITIES  </P> <P> The residential southwestern corner of Costa Mesa is a neighborhood that can,  and does, cause confusion, even for some people who live there. For in the less  than one square mile bordered on the north and south by Victoria and 19th  streets, respectively, on the east by Placentia Avenue and the west by the  Santa Ana River are segments of two different cities.  </P> <P> Ask someone on the street if this is the Newport Terrace area and most likely  he'll reply, "You're mistaken, this is Costa Mesa." That's largely true.  </P> <P> But a small pocket bordering on 19th Street adjacent to Talbert Regional Park  is actually a part of Newport Beach. Newport Terrace is so far removed from the  rest of Newport Beach and so nearly surrounded by Costa Mesa that it's easy to  understand why even the locals sometimes get confused.  </P> <P> Newport Terrace is a small pocket of relative affluence, boxed in by environs  of need. As is true of many other areas in Orange County, a couple of blocks  can make a tremendous difference in look and style.  </P> <P> Parts of the eastern section of the neighborhood are marked by the signs of  urban wear, age, and in some cases, decay or neglect. Nearly two blocks of  Victoria Street stand boarded. And according to the city there are no projects  planned that will make any difference. Would-be front lawns serve as parking  lots and crammed garages yawn lazily open, revealing their loads of every  imaginable kind of household detritus.  </P> <P> Maybe it's the oil wells along 19th Street, steadily pumping along their  elevated terrain, with greenery all about, that are the tip-off of the  differences to come. Balboa Boulevard, the aorta of Newport Terrace, may be a  cul de sac, but it's also the entry into a different kind of living. Shiny new,  expensive cars and well-manicured lawns signal a life style unlike that to the  east and north. Designer jogging suits seem the uniform of the day.  </P> <P> The 30-acre Newport Terrace Condominiums are the most prominent residential  feature along Balboa. And in the unreal world of Orange County real estate,  they represent something of an oasis of their own.  </P> <P> "This complex is the only property left in Newport Beach under $200,000," says  Fred Nicastro, broker for Century 21 in Newport Beach.  </P> <P> Prices start at $160,000 and, depending on the luxuries requested, level off  around $190,000. At the heart of the complex is a 10-acre greenbelt with de  rigueur amenities such as playground, barbecue and picnic areas, a full-size  swimming pool, wading pool for children, and a Jacuzzi.  </P> <P> Bob Vollmer of Management Service Co., managers of the complex, explains that  the condominiums were built in five phases, with the first completed in June,  1974, and the fifth on May 1, 1979. First-phase owners paid prices ranging from  $37,450 to $43,950.  </P> <P> According to Corinne Schlott, president of the homeowners' association, more  than just the price of the units has changed.  </P> <P> "When I moved into my condo in 1985, there was a 55% tenant occupancy rate. Now  owners are living in their properties, making it 55% owner-occupied. We  attribute this change to the increase of value of these properties."  </P> <P> Those owners and other residents are now waiting for the results of a survey  seeking to determine their feelings about development of the land along 19th  Street. Everyone was asked to state a preference: would residents like to see  single-family homes, apartments, townhouses, a light industrial center, or  would they prefer that the remnant wetland remain the way it is? Results are  not yet available, according to Schlott.  </P> <P> The most striking natural attraction here is the Talbert Regional Park site at  the western edge of the neighborhood. It is part of a 136-acre grassy and hilly  plot the county purchased May 17, 1977, from the State Mutual Savings &amp;  Loan Assn. for $2.1 million, according to Grace Secketa of the program planning  division of the Environmental Management Agency -- Harbors, Beaches and Parks.  Some of the area south of Victoria Street will remain wilderness, but exactly  which areas and how much is the subject of a study now in progress and  scheduled to be completed in mid-1990.  </P> <P> Although the site is not yet ready for public use, it is sure to become a  considerable lure for neighborhood residents and naturalists. Its grove of  mature willow trees (the biggest in the county), large pond and wetlands  provide a haven where egrets and great blue herons live and breed.  </P> <P> It is a place where the two cities will be able to come together, yet not  collide.  </P> <P> Population  </P> <P> Total: (1988 est.) 3,631  </P> <P> 1980-88 change: +7.0%  </P> <P> Median Age: 32.2  </P> <P> Racial/ethnic mix: White (non-Latino), 81%; Latino, 14%; Black, less than 1%;  Other, 5%  </P> <P> By sex and age:  </P> <P> MALES  </P> <P> Median age: 31.5 years  </P> <P> FEMALES  </P> <P> Median age: 33.0 years  </P> <P> Income  </P> <P> Per capita: $18,600  </P> <P> Median household: $46,772  </P> <P> Average household: $47,360  </P> <P> Income Distribution:  </P> <P> Less than $25,000: 22%  </P> <P> $25,000-49,999: 32%  </P> <P> $50,000-74,999: 30%  </P> <P> More than $75,000: 16%  </P></p>

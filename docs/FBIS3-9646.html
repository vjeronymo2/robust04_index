			<p>Language: <F P=105> Albanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Skender Minxhozi report: "Independent Trade Unions </F> Congress: Explosion Averted"]    [Text] While the Albanian state was celebrating the second  anniversary of the Democratic Party [PD] coming to power on 22  March, the Union of Independent Trade Union [BSPSh], one of the  country's two largest trade unions, was holding its first  congress in the Palace of Congresses in Tirana. These 48 hours,  expected to be a difficult test for the current BSPSh leadership  headed by Valer Xheka, ended without any dispute among the  fractions that have recently arisen within the trade union.  Chairman Xheka confirmed his dominance by receiving 90 percent  of the delegates' votes in the elections at the end of the  congress. It might be said that what was expected to be the  congress of the great split ended with the triumph of the  present leaders, who will continue to hold their positions at  the head of the first anticommunist trade union for four more  years. In fact, the neutralization of the fractionist group of  Valer Lubonja and Imir Kamba, the latter a cousin of PD  Secretary Tritan Shehu, was evident on the eve of the congress,  when their names were absent from all the lists of the  presidiums that were to chair the plenary sessions. Their  vilification as "separatists," "Red whippersnappers," and  "gangsters" in the general report delivered by BSPSh Secretary  Vilson Qendro, which provoked a positive reaction from the  audience, then sealed the fate of the "rebels," whom various  sources claim to have decided to create another trade union. In  this case, we would have a reprise of the secession of such  names as Gezim Kalaja and Sami Karriqi, who formed the  autonomous miners' union.    The BSPSh's first congress once again underlined the current  crisis of relations between this trade union and the state of  Berisha, despite their one-time alliance in the struggle against  communism. The end of this alliance became explicit at this  congress and was justified by the trade union's need to continue  its struggle to defend the workers' interests. "Becoming the  tool of parties means death for a trade union," Vilson Qendro  declared. He later accused the franctionists precisely of being  manipulated by "certain political forces," without naming them.  Vilson Qendro set out the demands on which the BSPSh will base  its strategy in the coming years. These include stemming the  hemorrhage of lay-offs, the linking of wages to the index of  inflation, pension increases, and a social policy from today's  state. Mr. Qendro criticized the government's indifference and  arrogance in excluding the trade union from making decisions  that involve social consequences for the population, and in not  seeing fit to negotiate a number of parliamentary bills with  trade union representatives. He went on to say that the Strike  Law is in fact an anti-strike law. The tone of the speeches at  the congress and the harsh criticisms addressed toward the Meksi  government might indicate a reawakening of the BSPSh, which has  so far been considered a body approving the Meksi cabinet's  economic platform and reforms.    President Berisha, in his speech of greeting at the start of  the first day's proceedings, openly stated that he had followed  developments within the BSPSh, wishing to convey the idea that  he continues to have total control over the trade union that  brought him to power. High-flown and euphoric, the Albanian  president said that he would act as a mediator between the trade  unionists and the government and that he considered the trade  union's demands to be fair, while he of course also expressed  satisfaction at the phrase in the report expressing support for  the reforms of the PD's state. He speech was an official permit  for Xheka to continue on his path for four more years after this  congress, which is time enough to settle in....</p>

			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / Pensioners set to exceed forecasts THE NUMBER of people over retirement age will be much higher in the next century than had previously been forecast, according to new figures from the 1991 census. Numbers in England and Wales over pension age will reach 14m by 2029, 9 per cent higher than the 1989 forecast of 12.8m. The proportion of people aged 75 and over will be 18 per cent higher than forecast in 1989, at 5.9m. This will further increase the age dependency ratio - the number of retired people as a proportion of those of working age. At present this stands at 30 for every 100 people of working age and is set to rise by 2029 to 45 per 100, compared with the 1989 projection of 41. Overall, the population of the UK will go on increasing slowly from 57.6m in 1991 to 62.1m in 2031, then fall with increasing rapidity, dropping below the 1991 level by 2061. For England and Wales the number of children under 16 is projected to increase by about 7 per cent between 1991 and 2001. The number will then decrease slowly until 2020, levelling out subsequently at 10.2m. The population of working age will grow by 6 per cent between 1991 and 2011, and then fall 7 per cent over the following 20 years. Within this group, however, the numbers under 30 will fall rapidly for the rest of the century and are not expected to return to the current level in the next 40 years.

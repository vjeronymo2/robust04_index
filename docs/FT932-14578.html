			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / Motoring: Racing that's hard to beat - How to put the fun back into driving THE ROADS get more crowded and stressful every month, holiday weekend tailbacks are awful and driving a car really is not much fun any more. Right? Well, yes. For most of the time, motoring is something one has to do to carry on a normal business and social life. The modern motor car - refined, reliable, comfortable and safe - is easy and effortless to drive. But fun? Surely not? And the Queen's highway is no place to have fun on. It is there to let you and me and about 24m other drivers go from A to B and back again without inconveniencing, frightening or banging into one another. For fun, you must get off the road. Off-road is usually taken to mean across country but it also covers private circuits. On both, you can enjoy yourself without breaking laws or putting anyone (including yourself) at risk. Providing facilities for this kind of fun has become big business. At various sites one can first be shown how to drive a racing car and then be allowed to have a go. Which was how I found myself in the company of about 20 other people at a wind and rain swept Brands Hatch racetrack in Kent. The Brands Hatch Racing Circuit company, Europe's largest organiser of racing instruction courses, also operates from Snetterton, near Norwich, and Oulton Park in Cheshire. After a briefing that stresses commonsense and safety, candidates start by driving three laps with an instructor in a race-prepared saloon car - in my case a Ford XR2i - complete with roll cage and full harness. It is not a foot-hard-down and hang-the-tail-out kind of drive. You are told to keep below 4,000 rpm. And warned that if you overdo it, you may be asked to leave the circuit. The instructor explains basic racing technique. It boils down to doing all braking and gear-changing in a straight line on the approach to a corner. Then, with the car set up properly, you accelerate, clipping the apex of the curve and using the full width of the track as you exit. At this early stage of race driving training, speed takes second place to smoothness because you cannot have one without the other. 'Be gentle. Coax the car; don't fight it,' is the instructor's theme - and, together with the need for ceaseless concentration, the main practical road-driving benefit. It must come as a surprise to 'boy racer' candidates who had equated fast driving with a heavy foot on the accelerator and sawing at the steering wheel. So far, the experience is not wildly different from driving a normal car on a miraculously wide and deserted road. The next stage - eight laps in a single-seat Formula First 1600 - is something else. I insinuated my legs into the sharp end, felt around for the pedals, lowered myself into the unpadded seat until my full-face helmet was just poking above the body and pressed the starter. Compared with a Formula 1 car, the Vauxhall Astra engined FF1600 is a toy, a Mickey Mouse racer. But the engine, only inches behind one's head, growls excitingly. As the car weighs next to nothing its acceleration matches a Porsche 911 Turbo's and it turns likes a gazelle pursued by a hungry lion. After a settling-down lap, I enjoyed myself. Having to use only the top two gears and strictly observe the 4,000 rpm took away none of the excitement. Handling a tiny, twitchy single-seater on a track streaming with water is a full-time job. One's horizon is limited by the rev counter, the two mirrors barely visible through a rain-spattered visor and a pair of front tyres flinging fountains of water high in the air. I was quite sorry to be flagged in at the end of my drive. Having squelched back to the debriefing instructor I asked him how on earth people like Nigel Mansell saw where they were going when they drove F1 cars in pouring rain at up to three times the speed I had been doing. 'With great difficulty,' he said. I believed him. An initial race-driving trial at Brands Hatch costs Pounds 79 on a weekday, Pounds 89 at weekends and a super trial (the main difference is that you get more driving) is Pounds 149 (Pounds 159 at weekends). About 15,000 people, ranging from teenagers to pensioners, have a go each year. One in four of them is female. Most candidates come just for the fun. Many have had courses as birthday or Christmas presents and may never go on a circuit again. It can, though, be a hesitant step toward a career in motor racing: former World Champion James Hunt drove his first single seater at a Brands Hatch circuit. Race driving training is not the only kind of fun motoring offered. There are also courses in off-road driving - the mud and slime variety  - in Suzuki Samurai 4x4s as well as in skid control. Of great potential road safety benefit is Earlydrive, which gives children their first experience of driving a real car on simulated urban road layouts. There is no lower age limit but they must be over 4ft 10in (145 cm) tall so they can reach the pedals. For details, telephone 0474-872331.</p>

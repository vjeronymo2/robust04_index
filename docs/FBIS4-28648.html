			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video; from the "NHK News" </F> program]    [Text] Commenting on possible sanctions against the DPRK  (North Korea) because of its suspected development of nuclear  arms, Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata said at a meeting of the House  of Councillors' Budget Committee this morning that it would be  difficult under the constitution for Japan to take part even in  nonmilitary measures, if they formed an integral part of  military action.    [Begin Hata recording] In terms of rear support, we will be  able to offer medical services or other forms of assistance  after hostilities have ended -- such as, for instance, the  minesweeping operations we did after the Gulf War. However,  operations which are an integral part of military action or the  use of force will be very difficult. [end recording]    Prime Minister Hata's remarks indicated that under the  constitution, it would be difficult for Japan to participate  even in nonmilitary operations which are an integral part of  military action.    Commenting further on intragovernmental deliberations on  responding to a United Nations decision to impose sanctions,  Hata said that while Japan was still persuading DPRK to seek a  solution through dialogue, it might give the wrong message to  North Korea to make public the detailed substance of such  deliberations.</p>

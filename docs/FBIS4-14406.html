			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Pavel Vanichkin] </F>   [Text] Washington, 31 Mar -- In a talk with an ITAR-TASS  correspondent, Oleb Lobov, secretary of the Russian Security  Council, who is on a visit to the United States, described his  meetings on Wednesday with high-ranking representatives of the  American administration as frank and constructive.    The main focus of attention at the meeting with Nicholas  Burns, special assistant to the U.S. President for affairs of  Russia, Ukraine, and Eurasia, was paid to getting to know the  work of the National Security Council's Russian department,  which he heads, Lobov noted.    We came to the conclusion that there is a need to establish  permanent contacts and to reach agreement, and that Burns should  pay a visit to Moscow in the future. We also handed the  American side a draft memorandum on cooperation between the U.S.  National Security Council and the Russian Security Council. The  document establishes the machinery of cooperation and stipulates  the periodicity of meetings and the field of questions to be  discussed. Such questions should include topical international  problems, peacemaking activities, and coordination of policy  toward various countries and regions.    We then had a meeting with James Collins, ambassador at  large  for the new independent states, Lobov continued. We talked  mainly about the prospects for cooperation between Russian  analysts and American experts on Russia and other countries of  the CIS working in the State Department, which should be aimed  at joint study of the situation in Russia and other countries,  and also the drafting of proposals for political leaders.    At a meeting with David Binney, acting director of the FBI,  what interested us most were questions of combating organized  crime, Lobov noted. Russia and the United States could expand  cooperation in combating organized crime, the drug barons,  economic crimes connected with evasion of taxes and customs  duties, and illegal exportation of goods. I think such  cooperation will be of benefit to both countries.</p>

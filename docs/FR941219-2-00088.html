			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All Project study and development costs, including compliance with Federal fish, wildlife, recreation and environmental laws, would be the expense of the lessee(s). Lease payments to the United States will be deposited in the Upper Colorado River Basin Fund. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Proposal Content Guidelines <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Interested parties should submit proposals explaining in as precise detail as is practicable how the Project would be developed. Factors which a proposal(s) should consider and address include, but are not limited to, the following: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A. Provide qualifications of the proposing entity(s). Include information on preference status, type of organization, length of time in business, experience in funding and design and construction of similar projects, industry rating(s) that indicate financial soundness of the potential lessee(s), experience of key management personnel, history of any reorganizations or mergers with other companies, and any other information that demonstrates the adequacy of the proposal and financial ability to fund all studies, designs, and construction. The term ``preference,'' as applied to a lease of power privilege, means an entity qualifying for preference to develop non-Federal hydroelectric power, under Section 9(c) of the 1939 Act, as a municipality, public corporation or agency, or cooperative or other nonprofit organization financed in whole or in part by loans made pursuant to the Rural Electrification Act of 1936. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B. Provide geographical locations and describe principal structures and other important features of the Project including roads and transmission lines. Estimate and describe installed capacity and the capacity of the power facilities under dry, average, and wet hydrological conditions. Also describe seasonal or annual generation patterns. Include estimates of the amount of electrical energy that would be produced from each facility for each month of average, dry, and wet water years. If capacity and energy can be delivered to another location, either by the proposing entity or by potential wheeling agents, specify where capacity and energy can be delivered. Include concepts for power sales and contractual arrangements, involved parties and the proposed approach to wheeling if required. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> C. Indicate title arrangements and the ability for acquiring title to or the right to occupy and use lands necessary for the Project, including such additional lands as may be required during construction. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> D. Identify water rights applicable to the proper operation of the Project, the holder of such rights, and how these rights would be acquired or perfected. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> E. Explain studies necessary to adequately define impacts on the CUP and the SVP and the environment in order to facilitate the decision making process. Explain any proposed use of the Project for conservation and utilization of the available water resources in the public interest. Describe any significant environmental issues and the approach for gathering data and handling the environmental issues to protect and enhance the quality of the environment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> F. Describe anticipated contractual arrangements with the District and the Association and define how the Project would operate in harmony with the CUP and the SVP. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> G. Provide a management plan to accomplish such activities as planning, NEPA compliance, design, construction, operation, and maintenance. Prepare schedules of these activities as is applicable. Describe what studies are necessary to accomplish the hydroelectric power development and how the studies would be implemented. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> H. Estimate Project development cost. This cost should include all investment costs such as the cost of studies to determine feasibility, NEPA compliance, design, construction, and financing as well as the amortized annual cost of the investment; also, the annual operation, maintenance, and replacement expense for the Project and other expenses associated with the CUP and the SVP. If there are additional transmission or wheeling expenses associated with the development of the Project, these should be included. Identify proposed methods of financing the Project. An economic analysis should be presented that compares the present worth of all benefits and costs of the Project. Additionally, a financial analysis should be presented that compares monies available to the United States for use of Federal facilities and costs to the CUP and the SVP. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Selection of Lessee <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Interior, in consultation with Western, will evaluate proposals received in response to this published notice. A proposal will be ruled unacceptable if it is not complete, is not consistent with both CUP and SVP purposes, and does not accommodate pre-existing legal rights of the District and the Association, as determined by Interior. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Selection of a lessee will be based on the following considerations: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> September 7, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PROF. CICERONE NAMED TO UCI'S ALDRICH CHAIR;  </P> <P> EDUCATION: GLOBALWARMING EXPERT IS SEEN AS SOMEONE WHO CAN ENHANCE THE  UNIVERSITY'S STATURE AS A CENTER OF RESEARCH INTO ENVIRONMENTAL DILEMMAS.  </P> <P> Atmospheric chemist Ralph J. Cicerone, an internationally known expert on  global warming, was named Thursday to UC Irvine's Daniel G. Aldrich Jr. endowed  chair, one of the university's most prestigious academic honors.  </P> <P> Cicerone was wooed away from the National Center for Atmospheric Research in  1989 to launch UCI's geosciences department, which will be the first of its  kind at a major university to study the dynamics of air, earth and sea.  </P> <P> In April, the 47-year-old Cicerone was elected to the elite National Academy of  Sciences, a lifetime appointment considered a pinnacle achievement for  scientists. He is the second professor to hold the Aldrich Chair, named for  UCI's founding chancellor.  </P> <P> "It was a nice surprise," said Cicerone, who learned of the appointment in a  letter from Chancellor Jack W. Peltason last Friday. "It's a major honor. I  thought the world of Chancellor Aldrich, as everyone did."  </P> <P> Aldrich, who died last spring, had a lifelong concern for the environment. This  second appointment appears to mark a trend that the holder of the Aldrich chair  be a distinguished researcher in global sciences.  </P> <P> Cicerone follows his colleague, UCI chemistry professor F. Sherwood Rowland,  who in 1974 first revealed to the world that Earth's protective ozone layer was  being destroyed by chemicals in aerosol sprays, air conditioners and cleaning  solvents. Rowland relinquished the Aldrich chair in 1989, when he was named the  university's second Bren Fellow, a $1-million endowment.  </P> <P> "It's kind of a natural fit," Peltason said of Cicerone's appointment to the  chair, which has an endowment of $340,000. "I think he's a splendid academic  citizen, and I'm very pleased that he chose to come here."  </P> <P> The Aldrich Chair, founded in 1984 with a $100,000 donation from the Irvine  Co., is one of 15 such endowments, which provide annual interest income to  support the research of prominent scholars.  </P> <P> Cicerone is widely viewed on campus as someone who can solidify and enhance  UCI's stature as a center of research into the most pressing environmental  dilemmas. It was Cicerone's work with Richard Stolarski of the University of  Michigan that laid the groundwork for Rowland's ozone discovery with Mario  Molina, now a researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  </P> <P> Cicerone also showed that gases other than carbon dioxide were instrumental in  the warming of the atmosphere, a phenomenon known as the "greenhouse effect."  </P> <P> "I can't think of anyone more deserving than Ralph Cicerone," said Harold  Moore, dean of UCI's School of Physical Sciences, which nominated him for the  Aldrich Chair. "He's a scholar of the very first rank. . . . He is a man with  not only the stellar documented academic credentials, but he also has . . .  equally great talents in the administrative arena."  </P> <P> Peltason said the geosciences department is a "natural next step" for a  university with the talents of a Rowland and a Cicerone.  </P> <P> "I have no doubt that this is one of the things for which we (UCI) will become  famous," Peltason said.  </P> <P> Cicerone said the UCI program will differ considerably from the work done at  the federally funded nonprofit National Center for Atmospheric Research in  Boulder, Colo., where he served as director of the atmospheric chemistry  division.  </P> <P> "The primary emphasis there was on the atmosphere," he said. "But the  atmosphere is not the whole story. We have to pay attention to the ocean and  the way the ocean and atmosphere and soils interact.  </P> <P> "We will be looking at a broader effort here, although the research will  emphasize the physics, the chemistry and the biology of the atmosphere.  </P> <P> "And here, the students will be central. We will be doing not only our  (research) work, but trying to make sure there are some awfully good people,  better than us to work in this area in the future. . . . We think the future  demands this."  </P> <P> Cicerone said that he is poised to hire several faculty in coming months and  that then the real work of building the department can begin.  </P> <P> The endowment is expected to generate about $20,000 to $25,000 annually.  Cicerone said he has not decided how to use the funds.  </P> <P> "I will be allowed to start various research projects or employ a student to  work on a project without any questions or lengthy (grant applications)," he  said. "That kind of freedom is very nice to have."  </P> <P> One project Cicerone is most eager to begin is a study of unusual chemicals  being produced in seawater. He hopes to collaborate with two researchers from  the Caltech and a Cal State Long Beach professor. He said the Aldrich Chair  income would barely begin to cover the cost of the project but could provide a  start.  </P></p>

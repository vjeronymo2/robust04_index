			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / International Company News: Fokker's latest restructuring plan fails to get off the ground - Dutch aircraft manufacturer faces a tough task after the chairman's unexpected resignation Fokker, the Dutch aircraft maker, is being forced to go back to the drawing board again this week. This time, the sketches being worked out at the company's Amsterdam headquarters are not the contours of a new regional jet or the shape of a turbo-prop commuter aircraft. Instead, Fokker, which has had more than its share of turbulence over the past 12 months - particularly the sale of a controlling majority stake to Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa) of Germany in April  -is trying to draw up new plans for deep cuts in operating costs. The company's restructuring plans were thrown into disarray on Monday when Mr Erik Jan Nederkoorn resigned after failing to win approval for his vision of how the cost price of Fokker's aircraft could be cut by 30 per cent over the next three years. Fokker is expected to launch a new plan later this month, even though a new permanent chairman has yet to be appointed. Mr Nederkoorn has been replaced temporarily by his vice-chairman, Mr Reinder van Duinen. Mr Nederkoorn's plans were considered too drastic by his management board and by his fellow Dutchmen on the supervisory board, where the Germans have a majority. Ironically, however, his unexpected departure may spur Dasa, which is facing job losses and difficulties of its own, to push the new management team to carry out an even stronger rationalisation of Fokker's operations and finances. Significantly, Dutch trade unions have bemoaned Mr Nederkoorn's resignation and are bracing for further bad news. One immediate consequence of this week's board shake-up - which besides Mr Nederkoorn's departure also includes the doubling of the management board to six members - is the appointment of a German, Mr Reinhard Volk, to the new board-level position of controller. Mr Volk, who will join Fokker from the engine-maker MTU - which, like Dasa, is part of the Daimler-Benz group - is the first German to join the management board since the takeover. Mr Nederkoorn envisaged a loss of between 1,000 and 1,200 jobs out of a total of 10,000 at Fokker. This reduction would have come hard on the heels of earlier job cuts that have steadily whittled down the size of the workforce from 13,500 in 1990. Equally controversial were plans for a wholesale shake-up of Fokker's corporate culture, including proposals to divide the company's internal component supply departments into smaller units of 300 to 400 employees each, which would be made responsible for their own profit-and-loss statements. The plans were based on the premise that Fokker should have just enough employees to build at least 60 aircraft a year, a far cry from the minimum 100 budgeted for as recently as 1990. Under a new restructuring plan, that number may have to be reduced still further to around 50. The number of job losses could rise to 2,000, and some of Fokker's manufacturing sites outside Amsterdam may have to close. But so far, the company has refused to discuss the contours of the new plan. Fokker, like other aircraft makers, is feeling the pinch because of the troubles being experienced by the world's airlines. Before the boardroom dispute erupted, it had been predicting a loss of Fl 150m (Dollars 77m) for 1993. Mr Nederkoorn's downfall is also partly a legacy of the bitterness aroused by Dasa's acquisition of a 51 per cent stake in the company. The German takeover, which sparked a debate with nationalistic overtones about the Netherlands' industrial future, was Mr Nederkoorn's responsibility, and his forthright manner caused friction inside and outside the company. Although Dasa is reported to want to go further than Mr Nederkoorn in restructuring Fokker, it decided in the end not to back him personally because of the boardroom split. Ironically, Fokker's management troubles come when it has managed to pull off a string of important orders which, although they cannot hope to rival the bigger deals seen in the 1980s, testify to the company's continued competitiveness. In late January, Air UK ordered eight 50-seater Fokker 50s and took out options on eight more. The order was regarded as important because sales of Fokker 50s had stagnated lately. Late last year, Fokker also won orders for its newest aeroplane, the Fokker 70, from Mesa Airlines of the US and from British Midland. The Fokker 70, launched in mid-1993, has now won customers in the US, Asia and Europe. But in the short term, the most important product to spring from Fokker's drawing board will have to be an economically viable restructuring plan capable of winning political and popular support in the Netherlands.</p>

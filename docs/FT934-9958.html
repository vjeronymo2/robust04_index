			<p>931108 FT  08 NOV 93 / International Company News: Franco-German talks lift telecom stakes THE TALKS between France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom about merging their international business and then possibly linking with American Telephone &amp; Telegraph are surprising only because of the size of the participants and the potential scope of collaboration. They are the world's three largest international telecommunications carriers and an alliance could involve co-operation on ordinary international voice traffic, data communications, video services and private networks. The idea of telecoms operators trying to form global alliances or mergers is not new. The industry has been a frenzy of matchmaking, as companies which mostly grew up as protected national monopolies have sought to prepare for the competitive global market. Much of the focus has been on 'outsourcing' - the provision of global services to multinational corporations. This year AT&amp;T established Worldsource, an alliance linking it to Japan's KDD and Singapore Telecom. The Swedish, Dutch and Swiss telecommunications carriers have created a partnership called Unisource. France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom have established Eunetcom. But June's Dollars 5.3bn deal between British Telecommunications and MCI, the second largest US carrier, involved not only a joint push into global outsourcing but also BT's acquisition of 20 per cent of MCI, so preparing the way for much deeper co-operation. The Franco-German talks and discussions with AT&amp;T have been spurred by a perceived need for a rival to BT/MCI. But before any alliance can be consummated, it faces several hurdles. On the commercial front, the partners will have to decide how much of their business they wish to merge. They will also need to decide whether to reinforce co-operation with equity stakes in one another and, if so, how large. France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom appear to want to merge all core activities apart from domestic voice services, though even these might be joined later. They also seem intent on bringing AT&amp;T in as a partner for Eunetcom and perhaps co-operating with the US carrier on transatlantic routes. But this could create strains with AT&amp;T, which appears to wish to be a more equal partner and which could threaten to go it alone if not satisfied. On the regulatory front, much will depend on the details of any proposal. The European Commission's competition authorities are likely to be concerned at the potentially anti-competitive effect of a wide-ranging link between France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom. It could compromise plans by the competition directorate to require governments to open their telephone markets to competition by 1998. A three-way link, bringing in AT&amp;T, could be of even greater concern. But other parts of the Commission might be more sympathetic. The French and German operators would argue that by joining forces they would be in a good position to create a pan-European 'intelligent network' - which would chime in with the support in the Maastricht Treaty for pan-European networks.</p>

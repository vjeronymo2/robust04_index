Makismovskiy under the rubric "The Future  is Being Born Today": "The Next Shift"]    [Text] All who work in space science are bothered by  the question of who will come into this sector tomorrow--and  will they come at all? This concern is elicited by the fact that  this intellectually capacious form of human activity is today  losing its attraction owing to the low pay. Time will pass, and  the prestige of the "space" professions will be restored. But  won't the potential created over decades be lost? Many people,  despite the difficulties, are countering this destructive  process by their deeds to keep this from happening. Among them  are those who train the cadres for space science.    Our correspondent Lieutenant-Colonel V. Maksimovskiy  visited Kaliningrad near Moscow and met with the director of the  College of Space Machine Building and Technology, P.  Timoshchenko, and his deputy for educational work V.  Nikolayevets.    [V. Maksimovskiy] First a little history, Petr Stepanovich.    [P.S. Timoshchenko] The very first steps in the development  and manufacture of ballistic missiles in the postwar years  showed that one cannot manage such a complex matter without the  purposeful training of specialists. This pertained first and  foremost to those who are engaged in production. Skilled people  trained in new fields and the chiefs of sections and shops were  needed. Chief Designer Sergey Pavlovich Korolev understood that  very well. He came forward to the Ministry of Armaments of the  USSR with an initiative to create an evening technical school  based on Trade School No. 3 at NII-88 [Scientific-Research  Institute 88], today the Machine Building TsNII [Central NII].  Then Minister D. Ustinov, taking into account the importance of  the task, on 15 March 1947 signed an order to organize a branch  of the Moscow Military- Mechanical Technical School with evening  training in the city of Kaliningrad.    The first graduation of degreed mechanical technicians,  design engineers and technicians for electronic equipment took  place four years later. Among them were Georgiy Mikhaylovich  Paukov, Viktor Andreyevich Frolov, later deputy chief designers,  along with future chiefs of the famous shop where the spacecraft  were and are assembled--Vladimir Ivanovich Zudinov, Grigoriy  Markovich Markov and Konstantin Georgiyevich Gorbatenko. Valeriy  Vasilyevich Ryumkin, today a famous pilot and cosmonaut of the  USSR and twice Hero of the Soviet Union, completed the school in  1958.    [V. Maksimovskiy] So your educational institution has  existed  as a branch for a long time?    [P.S. Timoshchenko] A day division was organized after the  first graduation, and the branch was re-organized into the  Kaliningrad Mechanical Technical School. Korolev knew how  important it was to maintain a contemporary level of  sophistication for the teaching laboratories and constant and  direct contacts of the trainees with the enterprises where they  would be working, and he did everything necessary. Missiles and  test beds on which the designers themselves studied, an engine  installation from the V-2, a Schmetterling cruise missile,  prototypes of Soviet missiles and much more were transferred  there at his orders. These traditions have been preserved. The  Soyuz spacecraft, a lunar landing module and a lunar orbital  craft have also appeared here with us.    A noteworthy instructional collective has been formed here  since the very beginning. N. Vorontsov, V. Postnikov, M. Rusov,  M. Belin, M. Zimin, M. Khokhlov, A. Shalashov and others  conducted special topics, while A. Khokhlova, A. Pyankov, S.  Pomyalov, B. Rukavishnikov and A. Kirimova (and not only they)  handled general education. We recalled our veterans warmly when  celebrating the 45th anniversary of the school-- Hero of the  Soviet Union A. Turikov, T. Tikhonova, L. Kabakova, V.  Belyayeva, N. Kostyukova, V. Lavrentsov and L. Yudicheva, among  others, along with the first directors--S. Malnikov, S.  Shcherbakov and Yu. Klimov. They were the ones whose labor  created the technical school and its traditions.    Classes were held and are held by specialists from  Kaliningrad defense industries, aside from the permanent  instructional personnel--from the Energiya NPO  [Scientific-Production Association], the Machine Building TsNII,  the Chemical Machine Building KB [Design Bureau], the  Measurement Engineering NPO and the Kompozit NPO. Technological  and pre-diploma practice takes place there for our students--the  places they will later be working. Approximately two thirds of  our graduates, by the way, have linked their activity with those  enterprises, either permanently or for a long time.    [V. Maksimovskiy] Today your "personnel plant" has a  different name. Why?    [P.S. Timoshchenko] The high level of instruction and  sophistication of the teaching process made it possible for the  technical school to become the Kaliningrad College of Space  Machine Building and Technology. This is not just a new name,  but a new quality as well.    [V. Maksimovskiy] I would like to address these questions to  your deputy. Valentin Vasilyevich, do you train a great many  specialists?    [V.V. Nikolayevets] We have about a thousand and a half  people training here. It is instructive that there have not been  fewer candidates in recent years, the passing score on entrance  exams is 8--9 for various fields, and we have many of them:  industrial engineer for the cold machining of metals, technician  for rocket engines or for airframes, programmer, radio  technician and control systems instruments, clerk.    There are also fields that have appeared owing to the  necessity of working under the new economic conditions and  conversion. These are specialists in orthopedic engineering, and  in management and marketing.    [V. Maksimovskiy] The latter is clear enough--you can't go  into the market without such training. But the former is quite  unusual.    [V.V. Nikolayevets] The fact that one of the most important  directions in the conversion of the Energiya NPO is the creation  of prosthetic and orthotic hardware using advanced space  technologies prompted us to engage in the training of  technicians for the most varied, complex and modern prostheses.  V. Legostayev, Deputy General Designer Yu. Semenova and Frau N.  Riedrich--a representative of the German firm of JPOS, which is  collaborating with the Energiya NPO in this noble cause--helped  us a great deal in "discovering" this new field.    [V. Maksimovskiy] Valentin Vasilyevich, tell us about the  problems that you are encountering in training personnel and  your views of the future.    [V.V. Nikolayevets] The structural restructuring that our  country is undergoing today, in my opinion, has affected the  non-production sphere and the defense sectors for which we train  specialists first and foremost. There is uncertainty in  financing, and in the quantity of them needed. The attempt to  make an abrupt transition to a market economy has led to the  fact that existing ties have been disrupted. Everyone is  "getting by" as best he can, and it must be said not always  efficiently. We naturally worry about the fate of our  educational institution. The unique laboratory base and skilled  instructional collective cannot be lost. That has not happened  yet, but the base fields are being displaced by others in some  places, often out of opportunistic considerations. But I think  this is a temporary matter. New and objectively essential fields  will appear, but will those in which we have trained, and are  training, the young people be preserved or resurrected? The  spiral of the development of society will move out of the  shadows and into the light.    [V. Maksimovskiy] I share your optimism. Success to your  collective, students and graduates!

			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / Siebe cost-cutting puts profits up by 9% A DRIVE to cut costs enabled Siebe, the UK-based international engineering systems and controls group, to increase profits in spite of continuing recession in nearly all of its main markets. Pre-tax profits rose 9 per cent to Pounds 185.1m for the year to April 3, although sales were nearly 1 per cent lower at Pounds 1.62bn. Net cash flow increased by Pounds 15.2m to Pounds 95.2m and gearing, excluding finance leases, fell from 78.8 to 60.4 per cent. Mr Barrie Stephens, chairman, said the group was well on course to reduce the gearing percentage to the mid-50s by the autumn - a commitment made to shareholders when the group bought Foxboro, the US controls business, in 1990. Mr Stephens said: 'Market shares have increased in all four core businesses. Each division launched a significant number of successful new products during the year. 'These excellent results also reflect our rigorous management of working capital and cash flow and emphasise the powerful position from which we shall grow and enhance our shareholders' value as economic conditions surely improve.' The group said the final quarter of the period confirmed indications of an improvement in the US and UK. It also believed that Japanese markets would recover within the next 18 months. Mr Stephens said: 'These encouraging indications, together with Siebe's significantly stronger order book and and strong balance sheet, with cash of Pounds 205m, leads the group to look forward with confidence to the future.' Siebe increased its net trading margins across the group from 10.4 to 11.4 per cent. with all segments showing improvement. Productivity increased, with manning reduced by 6.1 per cent, or 1,932 employees. Sales volumes were down 4.3 per cent in constant currency terms. Overseas business accounted for 91.5 per cent of group sales and 89.2 per cent of group profits. Group spending on research and development was Pounds 65.5m, or 4 per cent of turnover, which was taken through the profit and loss account. A further Pounds 23m of spending on software was capitalised as intangible assets, although that was less than the equivalent depreciation charge of Pounds 31m. Earnings per share rose by 14 per cent to 27.2p from 23.8p. A final dividend of 6.6725p gives a total for the year of 10p, against 9.075p, a rise of 10.2 per cent, which is covered 2.7 times.

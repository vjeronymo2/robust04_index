The official newspaper "NODONG SINMUN" said in a commentary  that the United States and DPRK should hold their talks on the  basis of mutual understanding and cooperation.    It added that threats and pressure would only lead to a  worse  situation.    The commentary stressed that only dialogue and negotiation  could solve the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula in a just  way.    It also appealed to South Korea not to hamper the U.S-DPRK  talks which "would seek interests for all Koreans."    After two rounds of high-level talks and several contacts  since last year, the two countries have reached agreements on  some issues. On December 30, 1993, the United States declared  that it would stop the annual "Team Spirit" joint military  exercises with South Korea while DPRK agreed to accept necessary  international inspections of its suspected nuclear facilities to  guarantee their security.    Meanwhile, the two sides agreed to hold a third round of  talks on a package of plans to solve the nuclear issue on the  Korean peninsula.</p>

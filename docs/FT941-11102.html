			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / Books: Own goals for Auntie - Ray Snoddy tunes in to the backbiting at the BBC FUZZY MONSTERS: FEAR AND LOATHING AT THE BBC By Chris Horrie and Steve Clarke Heinemann Pounds 16.99, 315 pages There must be days when John Birt, the controversial director-general of the BBC, wishes he had stayed at London Weekend Television where he could happily have become a millionaire, like many other LWT executives, and escaped years of headlines and vilification. There are quite a few at the BBC who also wish he had stayed in commercial television instead of coming to 'modernise' a key British institution. Michael Grade and Michael Checkland must be among them. It was Grade who recommended John Birt as the man to unite BBC news and current affairs, before falling foul of Birt's ambition, and Checkland who brought him into the corporation, only to be humiliated by Birt's main patron Marmaduke Hussey, the BBC chairman. Horrie, half of the team that 'monstered' Sun editor Kelvin Mackenzie in an earlier book, Stick it up your Punter, here backed up by broadcasting writer Steve Clarke, weaves a compelling and entertaining tale from the latter-day 'scandals' of the BBC. They range from the sacking of director-general Alastair Milne to the row over John Birt's freelance employment status for six years as deputy and, for a time, as director- general. And then there were the Fuzzy Monsters of the title - a reference to the marvellous moment when Checkland finally flipped and publicly attacked Hussey and the BBC governors for being too old and unrepresentative. He would rather work, Checkland said, with people who did not think FM stood for fuzzy monsters. More important than the farcical rows are the reports on life in the Birt Broadcasting Corporation and the doings and sayings of the great strategic planner. Did Birt really turn up in Manchester and, after a brief tour, denounce the BBC headquarters there as old fashioned, dirty, a total waste of time and deserving of closure, even though Pounds 8m had just been spent on refurbishing the main studio? Did he really tell members of a resources committee, when challenged on his views, that you cannot change your goal, 'and that is the first rule of effective management. You must not change your vision?' Luckily, for the sake of viewers and listeners, a great deal of the Birtist vision has been quietly modified where it has not been jettisoned. There is much less talk these days of going for the 'higher ground' and aiming for 'distinctiveness' in programme-making and there is much more emphasis on providing all licence payers with the service they might actually want to watch. Even Panorama, long stifled by the Birtian analytical approach, has started telling stories again. Unfortunately, in an echo of the past, the BBC is now trying to make Radio 1 more 'distinctive' with almost immediate results. The network has lost more than two million listeners according to the latest research - listeners who are unlikely to return. Horrie and Clarke, in what will undoubtedly be the first of a number of Birt and the Beeb books, do justice to the 'fear and loathing' in the organisation and the feeling of many BBC employees that they were being subjected to a politically-inspired coup. The book gets to grips with a number of important questions rather less well. How efficient was the old BBC? How is it going to compete in the increasingly difficult broadcasting environment? If reform was needed could it really have happened without pain and redundancy? Was there a better approach than John Birt's bureaucratic methods? In the end, Birt's reputation will depend much more on the answers to such questions than on Fuzzy Monsters or the fear and loathing he has undoubtedly provoked.</p>

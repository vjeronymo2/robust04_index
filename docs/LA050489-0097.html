			<p><P> May 4, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TENNIS ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> WILANDER TAKES YET ANOTHER EMBARRASSING FALL  </P> <P> Second-ranked Mats Wilander continued his downward slide Wednesday with a 6-1,  6-3 loss to Francesco Cancellotti of Italy in the second round of the  Tournament of Champions at Forest Hills, N.Y.  </P> <P> Cancellotti, ranked 86th in the world, eliminated the Swede in 57 minutes at  the West Side Tennis Club.  </P> <P> "The Wilander I beat today is not the No. 2 player in the world," said  Cancellotti, who won his first-round match earlier in the day. "He's a  completely different player than last year. It looks like it doesn't make a  difference whether he wins or loses."  </P> <P> "I played a good match today, but he's not fighting anymore. Maybe he can't  find the right motivation. You should ask him what's going on in his mind."  </P> <P> Reporters didn't have a chance because Wilander didn't show up for the  postmatch interview. He apparently is tired of explaining the slump he has  endured since taking the No. 1 ranking from Ivan Lendl in the U.S. Open last  September.  </P> <P> Wilander held the top spot for just four months, falling to second with an  early loss at the Australian Open in January. Since then, he has lost six of 11  matches, including two defeats by Austrians in the Davis Cup quarterfinals.  </P> <P> "To see Wilander on the court like this is not a good thing for tennis,"  Cancellotti said.  </P> <P> Lendl breezed into the third round with a 6-2, 6-3 victory over Martin  Wostenholme of Canada.  </P> <P> Fifth-seeded Yannick Noah of France had to retire because of a foot injury.  Noah reinjured his right foot during a second-round match against Jaime Yzaga  of Peru.  </P> <P> Noah lost the first set, 6-2, and was serving at 2-2 in the second when he  rushed the net, pulled up hobbling and fell to the ground in pain. He was  helped to his feet but walked off under his own power.  </P> <P> In other second-round matches, defending champion Andre Agassi, who has not  reached a Grand Prix final this year, took control in the third set to beat  Fernando Luna of Spain, 6-4, 4-6, 6-0; fourth-seeded Tim Mayotte downed Bruno  Oresar of Yugoslavia, 7-6 (7-4), 6-4; No. 7 Brad Gilbert defeated Alex  Antonitsch of Austria, 7-5, 6-4, and No. 8 Michael Chang saved four match  points before turning back Josef Cihak of Czechoslovakia, 6-4, 4-6, 7-5.  </P> <P> "This was a good win for me," Chang said. "When you're down like that, you want  to find the nearest bed and go to sleep."  </P> <P> In a first-round match, No. 13 Jay Berger was upset by Richey Reneberg, 6-7  (7-6), 6-4, 6-4.  </P> <P> Andrea Vieira, an 18-year-old Brazilian, upset second-seeded Helena Sukova of  Czechoslovakia, 7-5, 1-6, 6-4, in a $200,000 Virginia Slims tournament at  Hamburg, West Germany.  </P> <P> The match was interrupted by darkness Tuesday, and Vieira completed the victory  Wednesday.  </P> <P> "I never heard of her before," said Sukova, ranked fifth in the world and the  runner-up in the Australian Open. "She used my mistakes."  </P> <P> Said Vieira, ranked 128th in the world: "This was a totally unexpected victory  for me."  </P> <P> Sylvia Hanika of West Germany reached the third round by beating Patricia  Tarabini of Argentina, 6-3, 6-1.  </P> <P> "I was able to apply full pressure," said Hanika, who had to withdraw from a  tournament in Barcelona last week because of a shoulder injury.  </P> <P> In other action, Arantxa Sanchez of Spain ousted Wiltrud Probst of West  Germany, 6-2, 6-2, while Manuela Maleeva of Bulgaria beat Christine Damas of  France, 6-2, 6-3.  </P> <P> Nicole Jagerman of the Netherlands earned the dubious honor of becoming  top-seeded Steffi Graf's first opponent by sweeping past Gisele Miro of Brazil,  6-3, 6-1.  </P> <P> Graf advanced to the third round by default when Sabine Hack of West Germany  became ill and withdrew from the clay-court tournament.  </P> <P> Audra Keller of Memphis, seeded No. 1 in the 18-and-under division, opened the  Seventeen Magazine tournament with a 6-0, 6-0 victory over Vickie Paynter of  Denville, N.J., at Mission Viejo.  </P> <P> Second-seeded Cammie Foley of Bonita also advanced, but she was extended before  finally downing Michelle McMillen of East Palestine, Ohio, 5-7, 6-4, 6-4.  </P> <P> In the 16-and-under competition, No. 1-seeded Keri Phebus of Newport Beach  scored a 6-2, 6-0 win over Susie Starett of North Aurora, Ill.  </P> <P> In the 14-and-under class, Nicole London of Rolling Hills Estates beat Robyn  Gurney of Candler, N.C., 6-1, 6-0.  </P> <P> The tournament, which includes 96 players from 30 states and Puerto Rico,  continues through Saturday.  </P></p>

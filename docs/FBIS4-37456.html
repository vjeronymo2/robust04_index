			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin says the gap between  the positions of Israel and Syria is very large. But, speaking  to reporters at an army camp on the Golan Heights this morning,  Rabin called on Damascus to open direct, high-level negotiations  with Israel.    [Begin recording] [Rabin] The time has arrived that Syria  will start to realize that the best way to negotiate peace with  Israel is to sit face to face on higher levels than it was done  till now, and to talk in a serious way how to reach peace  between our two countries.    [Unidentified correspondent] When do you expect the peace  talks to resume with Syria face to face?    [Rabin] As you know, at this stage it is conducted through  the visits of the secretary of state. We are ready to continue  in the way that the United States serves as go-between,  hopefully to create a basis that will bring about meetings on  higher levels between Syria and Israel. I cannot see how a real  agreement or peace treaty can be reached without a certain stage  of meetings on the higher levels than it is today.    [Correspondent] Mr. Rabin, Mr. Christopher is not coming to  the Middle East at this time. What could bring the sides back  to the table?    [Rabin] I cannot speak in the name of the secretary of state  but I believe that he will come. If it is not going to happen  in June, it will happen in July. [end recording]</p>

			<p><P> June 29, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> OUSTED ESCONDIDO CITY MANAGER IS HIRED BY OXNARD  </P> <P> Ousted Oxnard City Manager David Mora will be replaced by Vernon G. Hazen, a  former city manager in Escondido who also was forced to resign his post last  year, the City Council announced Thursday.  </P> <P> Hazen, 54, who was unanimously chosen by the council during closed-door  meetings this week, will begin his new job Aug. 13. Mora, who was forced to  resigned after a 3-2 council vote in December, ends his five-year tenure in  Oxnard today.  </P> <P> Assistant City Manager John Tooker will act as city manager in the interim.  </P> <P> "He's a real people person," Councilwoman Ann Johs said of Hazen. "I think we  need a people person in Oxnard."  </P> <P> Councilman Manuel Lopez said the council interviewed five candidates for the  job but chose Hazen because he had the most experience as a city manager.  Hazen's salary has not been negotiated, council members said. Mora earns  $95,705 a year.  </P> <P> The California native had been the top administrator of Escondido in north San  Diego County since 1982 and earned $95,000 a year. He formerly was city manager  in the Northern California towns of Mill Valley for seven years and Mountain  View for 12 years.  </P> <P> Hazen resigned his post in Escondido in January, just hours before the council  was scheduled to meet in closed-door session to consider firing him.  </P> <P> Hazen lost the support of a majority of the council soon after two slow-growth  council candidates -- Carla DeDominicis and Kris Murphy -- were elected,  joining veteran Councilman Jerry Harmon to form the city's first slow-growth  majority on the five-member council.  </P> <P> He said Thursday that he resigned because the new council majority felt he  could not carry out a slow-growth development policy after overseeing a very  pro-growth policy under the previous council.  </P> <P> Hazen said Escondido grew from a population of about 65,000 to about 104,000  during his tenure. Despite the unceremonious circumstances of his departure,  Hazen said he left Escondido on "amiable" terms.  </P> <P> Escondido Councilman Ernie Cowan, who voted to keep Hazen, said the former city  manager was forced to resign for purely political reasons. He said Hazen was  "just tainted by the fact that he was the man, so to speak, of the previous  council."  </P> <P> Cowan called Hazen an innovator and said he "brought Escondido into the 20th  Century."  </P> <P> For the last year and a half, Hazen has worked as a private consultant,  developing a general plan for a 23,000-acre planned community near Chula Vista.  However, he said he sought the post in Oxnard because he missed working as a  city manager. "I think it's a blood-related disease," he said.  </P> <P> Hazen has inherited a city plagued for the last three years with financial  woes. The council this week avoided a $2.8-million deficit in the 1990-91  fiscal year by cutting 18 1/2 staff positions and injecting the budget with  $1.2 million in onetime windfall revenues.  </P> <P> Hazen said he needs to further study the city's budgetary policies before  making any suggestions on the budget. However, he said he would have supported  a 5% utility tax increase, which city officials had hoped would solve the  city's financial problems by generating $5 million annually. Voters rejected  the tax measure June 5 by a 3-to-1 margin.  </P> <P> Mora's ouster was supported by Johs and Councilwomen Dorothy Maron and  Geraldine (Gerry) Furr, who blamed him for the city's financial woes. Maron  also has questioned the concessions made to developers by Mora's staff to lure  development to the city.  </P> <P> After Mora's resignation, a group of Oxnard residents, including members of the  National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People and the Assn. of Mexican  American Educators, accused the councilwomen of racial discrimination for  forcing out the Latino city manager. More than 50% of Oxnard residents are  Latino.  </P> <P> The group called Community Concern launched a recall petition against Maron,  saying she is unresponsive to their request to review the decision to fire  Mora. The group has until July 13 to gather 9,300 signatures to qualify the  recall measure for the November ballot. It has collected about 8,000, said  Community Concern spokesman Ray Tafoya.  </P> <P> Hazen said he does not speak fluent Spanish but has dealt with many issues in  Mountain View concerning Latinos and Asians.  </P> <P> "Ethnic diversity adds to the richness of the community," he said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 2, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Former Democratic Rep. John Jenrette of South Carolina, who lost his seat in  Congress after he was convicted in the 1980 FBI Abscam operation, won a delay  in his trial on shoplifting charges. Jenrette, a disbarred lawyer and  recovering alcoholic, asked Judge Thomas Rothrock of Fairfax County General  District Court in Virginia for a delay so he could seek medical treatment.  Rothrock agreed to postpone the proceedings until Feb. 23. Jenrette attorney  Warren McLain said his client suffers from ulcers and may also have caught the  flu. Jenrette was visiting friends in Virginia when he was arrested for  shoplifting at a Marshall's store.  </P></p>

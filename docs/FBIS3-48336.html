The device is 1.4 millimeters in diameter and has a pivot  that rotates 100 to 160 times a minute, said officials at the  institute, a subsidiary of Matsushita Electric Industrial Co.,  one of the world's largest electronics manufacturers.    To make the motor, researchers covered a ceramic pivot one  millimeter in diameter with resin, fixed 16 electrodes to the  resin and enveloped them in a cylinder. Then they dissolved the  resin to let the pivot rotate within the cylinder.    They aim to upgrade the motor several years from now to  produce as much power as the one currently used for pagers,  which is 1.2 centimeters long and six millimeters in diameter,  said Takeo Sato of the institute based in Kawasaki, Kanagawa  Prefecture.    The motor could be applicable to micro-technology for use in  human blood vessels to check or treat diseases, he said.</p>

			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Rise of 4.5% seen for prices of homes House prices should increase an average of 4.5 per cent both this year and next, according to Mr Patrick Moon, an economic adviser to Lloyds Bank. Writing in the bank's economic bulletin, Mr Moon forecasts accelerating price rises in later years, lifting prices an average of 5.5 per cent a year up to 1998. However, only in 1997 will negative equity cease to be a drag on the market. Mr Moon's forecasts for this year and next year suggest that house prices will rise somewhat faster than inflation. However, this contrasts with reports last week from Halifax and Nationwide building societies. Halifax, the largest lender, said prices had been broadly stable since the beginning of the year while Nationwide said price rises were likely to be close to the rate of inflation by the end of this year. Prices are forecast to rise fastest in the south-east over the next five years with an annual average rate of 6.9 per cent while prices will rise most slowly in the Yorkshire areas and Humberside, where the average annual increase is expected to be 3.7 per cent.</p>

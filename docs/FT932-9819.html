			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / Letter: An unfair, but particularly British, moan about Don Quixote Sir, For most of the time Clement Crisp's ballet reviews make for enjoyable reading. They are critical in the original, positive, meaning of the word and are enriched with lots of historical details reflecting Mr Crisp's profound knowledge of the matter. His destructive views on the Royal Ballet's new production 'Don Quixote' (April 10 and April 28), however, and much more so the supporting letter by Mr Varcoe-Cocks (Letters, May 8), remind me of that British disease called moaning. Marc Thompson's admittedly very unusual, and at first glance possibly disillusioning, designs serve the real purpose of ballet designs, which is helping the mind and the eye, to concentrate on the very dancing itself (that is, supporting it instead of competing with it), and are at the same time a most promising way of introducing classical ballet to a wider and younger audience. The latter point especially is essential for classical dancing to survive well into the next century. On the night that I was fortunate enough to attend the performance the dancing was splendidly and most beautifully delivered by Leanne Benjamin, Jose Manuel Carreno and the supporting cast and was obviously very much enjoyed not only by the artists themselves but by the vast majority of a near-capacity audience as well. I only hope the reasons for some of the seats being left empty have nothing to do with Mr Crisp's views, which this time were far too conservative (or may I say, as an elderly lady sitting just beside me suggested) reactionary. It would have been a pity. The Royal Ballet can only be congratulated for sticking to its way by including 'Don Quixote' in the 1993-94 season programme as well.

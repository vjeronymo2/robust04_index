			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: by Andrey </F> Pershin, Andrey Petrovskiy, and Vladimir Shishlin; edited by  Boris Grishchenko]    [Text] President Mircea Snegur met in Chisinau on Tuesday  [4 January] with Ion Drutse, a noted Moldova writer permanently  living in Russia. Preparation for parliamentary elections was  discussed. The elections are due on February 27.    Independent experts believe that Drutse's arrival in the  republic at the peak of the election campaign may tangibly  affect its outcome. The writer is immensely popular in Moldova,  so many observers predict that he will be able to win thousands  of extra votes for the centrist agrarian-democratic and  social-democratic parties.    IF [INTERFAX] Note: Snegur declared in a recent exclusive  interview with INTERFAX that he was not going to stay neutral,  and resolutely supported these centrist parties in their  advocacy of state sovereignty and aversion for reunion with  Romania.    The opposition parties and movements which advocate reunion  with Romania have been holding rallies in protest against the  guilty verdict passed on a group of Christian Democratic Popular  Front supporters by a court in Tiraspol. Snegur administration  officials regard these actions as part of an anti-presidential  campaign to charge their chief with betrayal and duplicity.    The president's spokesman, Vasile Grozavu, told INTERFAX  that Snegur emphatically rejects allegations that "he has kept a  conflict in Moldova's east from the world public. However, it  was Snegur who invited a CSCE mission to monitor the situation  in the region and help to remove the differences there. In a  statement released in Rome, the foreign ministers of the CSCE  participant-states pledged to spare no further effort to secure  a settlement.    More than that, Snegur has repeatedly urged reactivating a  four-sided mechanism to resolve the region's problems. The  issue re-surfaced at a recent summit with Ukraine's President  Kravchuk.    Grozavu dismissed as improper an assertion by some media  that  Snegur is responsible "for an economic disaster." It is common  knowledge, he noted, under what conditions the ministers were  nominated and appointed in parliament and how many pledges were  made by certain parliamentary factions behind the scenes and  otherwise to win some ministers' approval.    It was this and nothing else, Grozavu added, that prompted  the president to back up the initiative to dissolve parliament  and elect a new legislature with representatives of one party or  a coalition apt to run the country.    Grozavu reported that the president was preparing a special  statement "about the conflict on the Dniester and its true  culprits." "The document," he stressed, "would be a convincing  response to irresponsible charges by those who are making  patriotism their trade."</p>

			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Klimt painting sold for Pounds 3.74m A painting by the Austrian artist Gustav Klimt, 'Flower Garden' dating from about 1906, sold for Pounds 3.74m at Christie's last night. Once described as a 'firework display of summer heat', it was bought by a private investor. The price was at the lower end of Christie's estimate, but was a record for a Klimt landscape and set the seal on a successful auction of Impressionist and modern art which totalled Pounds 15.1m.</p>

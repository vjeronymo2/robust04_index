			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article in five installments: "A Close Look </F> at the Trust Fund Bureau"; the last installment is based on an  interview with Atsushi Miyawaki, senior economist of the Japan  Research Institute; place and date not given]  <H5>  [5 Apr 94 p 7] </H5>   [Text] The fiscal investment and loan program has been, and  is being, used not only for successive countercyclical measures  but also to subrogate government budget in the funding of  certain activities normally covered under the budget's general  account. The Trust Fund Bureau of the Ministry of Finance  [MOF], which provides the funds for the fiscal investment  program, is a gigantic "government purse" with an asset capacity  in excess of 320 trillion yen. Recently, this very Trust Fund  Bureau began causing a variety of unsettling problems: the  disturbance of the bond market caused by the Trust Fund Bureau's  sale of its government bond holdings was a case in point. The  rising cost of collecting postal savings, a source of funds for  the Trust Fund Bureau, and the swollen flow of funds from the  Trust Fund Bureau through government-affiliated financial  institutions are further exacerbating economic strains. What  follows is an investigation of the problems surrounding the  Trust Fund Bureau.  <H5>  The Price of Abusing an "Aladdin's Lamp": Hypertrophy </H5> Causing Grating Pains Everywhere    "No doubt the MOF is waiting for bond prices to rise  (pushing  the yield down). As soon as the price goes up, for sure the MOF  will move to sell its bond holdings. It is too scary to buy  bonds." These are the words being whispered around of late  among those dealing with the bond market.  <H5>  Clearance Sales of Government Bonds Rocked the Market </H5>   What the market is wary of is the Trust Fund Bureau's  disposal (selling out) of government bonds with no repurchase  provisions. The Trust Fund Bureau gathers funds from postal  savings and welfare pension premiums and lends them to such  institutions as the Housing Loan Corporation and the Japan  Highway Public Corporation. The MOF, which manages the Trust  Fund Bureau's fund position, on 14 January decided to sell its  bond holdings worth some 900 billion yen in successive  increments. The reason for the decision was that, as a result  of more than 13 trillion yen the Trust Fund Bureau had poured  into institutions such as the Housing Loan Corporation and the  Small Business Finance Corporation in conjunction with the four  rounds of countercyclical measures put into effect since August  1991, the Trust Fund Bureau's fund position became so critical  that the ministry decided the only way to get the Trust Fund  Bureau out of the fix was to raise additional funds by selling  off its government-bond holdings on the market.    The disposal by the Trust Fund Bureau of its government bond  holdings began on 21 January. The sale on that day was worth  102.8 billion yen; it was followed by another sale on 4 February  which was worth 115.3 billion yen, and by yet another sale worth  86.8 billion yen on 21 February. These sales of government  bonds by the Trust Fund Bureau rocked the market severely. The  yield on long-term government bonds, which was at the 2.9  percent range early in January, rose sharply to reach above 4  percent at the beginning of March.    In the interest of supporting the bond market, the current  situation would normally call for a buying-up operation either  by the Trust Fund Bureau or by using the National Debt  Consolidation Fund; however, sources within the MOF  categorically state that "no such action is being considered at  all" (words of an official of the Financial Bureau, MOF). The  Trust Fund Bureau of course is in no shape to take such an  action, but another factor is that even the National Debt  Consolidation Fund, too, cannot be of much help because there is  a two-year suspension of fixed-rate transfers of funds into the  reserves for government bond redemption; "even if they wanted to  run a buying operation, they lack the resources for it."  <H5>  The Bank of Japan Frowns at the Trust Fund Bureau Action </H5>   Not only is the MOF planning no action to support the bond  market, it is rather poised to sell at the next appropriate time  the remainder of its government bond holdings originally planned  for disposal--the remainder worth some 600 billion yen.    The sales of government bonds by the Trust Fund Bureau have  triggered a sharp rise in long-term interest rates. As a  result, the bank's lending rates have begun to rise as well,  spawning a fear that all this could once again prove to be a  drag on the economy which at last is beginning to show some  signs of brightness. It is said that "even the Bank of Japan is  frowning at the Trust Fund Bureau's recent moves" (according to  a ranking city bank).    A dispute arose within the MOF in the fall of 1993. Fumio  Inui, chief of the First Fund Planning and Operation Division,  Financial Bureau, MOF, who controls the Trust Fund Bureau's  affairs, complaining bitterly about the dire fund position of  the Trust Fund Bureau, took firm stand against the ministry's  Budget Bureau responsible for the preparation of the  general-account budget: he told the Budget Bureau that the  Trust Fund Bureau "could no longer cooperate with them as  actively as it had done before."    Over the past years, the Trust Fund Bureau has turned into a  handy reservoir of funds which can be tapped into to circumvent  shortfalls in the general-account budget whose fiscal condition  has become increasingly tight. To be specific, it is the Trust  Fund Bureau that has provided funds to the National Railway  Settlement Corporation that inherited the old liabilities of the  former National Railways; also, it is the Trust Fund Bureau that  pitches in with funds to meet any shortfall in local allocation  tax revenue which the central government must distribute to  local governments. In the final analysis, what enabled the  government to somehow muddle through with its countercyclical  measures was the availability of a "trump card" at its  disposal--i.e., a bold expansion of the fiscal investment plans  financed by the Trust Fund Bureau's funds.    Public properties and facilities, the benefit of which is  widely shared by the people, shall be paid for with the  general-account funds, while semi-public facilities such as  expressways shall be funded by the Trust Fund Bureau--this  guiding principle broke down long ago; it cannot be denied that  there has been a tendency by the government to readily make use  of the Trust Fund Bureau as the source of "invisible loans" for  national and local self-governing entities.    The Trust Fund Bureau has been abused like an "Aladdin's  lamp." In the background responsible for the abuse is the handy  availability of Trust Fund Bureau funds, the utilization of  which for a period of less than five years does not even require  consent of the Diet. Neither a temporary transfer of Trust Fund  Bureau funds into the Special Account for Local Allocation Tax  nor a disposal of the Trust Fund Bureau's government-bond  holdings is ever reflected in the fiscal investment and loan  plan submitted to the Diet. The assets in the Trust Fund  Bureau's custody, which totaled less than 100 trillion yen in  the 1980's, have ballooned to 321 trillion yen, some of which  have been coming in and out of the Trust Fund Bureau without  being checked by anybody. But the Trust Fund Bureau's surplus  funds have reached the bottom; furthermore, the Trust Fund  Bureau is now being hit by a "market backlash" in the form of a  sharp drop in bond prices.  <H5>  Information Disclosure Should Be the First Step </H5>   "The time has come to review the question of the Trust Fund  Bureau's `posture as it ought to be,' including the ideal way of  fiscal operations." These words advocating reform of the Trust  Fund Bureau were spoken by none other than Seiji Kanematsu,  chairman of the Fund Operation Council (an advisory body for  ministers of finance and of posts and telecommunications). It  would not be easy to apply a surgical knife to the Trust Fund  Bureau, which is even likened to a house of demons. Would it be  wrong to suggest that the first step toward reform should be to  promote disclosure of information regarding the Trust Fund  Bureau in such terms that can be understood even by ordinary  people?  <H5>  [6 Apr 94 p 7] </H5>   [Text] Disparity Between "Fund Procurement" and "Fund  Operation": Contradiction Widens Due to Deregulation of  Interest Rates    "What you are saying is absolutely no different from the  very  logic being pursued by the Ministry of Posts and  Telecommunications [MOPT]." This has been the caustic criticism  leveled at (Hiroshi) Nagano, councilor to the MOF's Banking  Bureau, every time he made a round of city banks and reginal  banks since the middle of February to lay a certain groundwork.  <H5>  Concern of the Private Sector Failed To Be Dispelled </H5>   The aim of the groundwork has been to gain acceptance by the  banks of the MOF's proposal concerning the question of  deregulating the interest rates on liquid deposits and savings  which can readily be deposited and withdrawn; one of the key  points of the proposal reads, "The interest-rate differential  between regular postal savings (current rate 1.32 percent) and  the ordinary bank deposit (current rate 0.22 percent) shall be  maintained at 1.1 percent for the present time." The reason for  the MOF's drive to get its proposal through is twofold: First,  it would mean a culmination of the deposit rate deregulation  effort of 15 years standing; second, the MOF feels obliged to  get this matter settled somehow or other because, for one thing,  Japan officially promised the United States to put interest-rate  deregulation into effect before the end of 1994.    Councilor Nagano has sought the banking industry's  understanding of the MOF's position as to why the bank deposit  cannot be given unduly favorable consideration in the proposed  deregulation of interest rates. But the debate between him and  the industry has failed to reach a point of agreement. Behind  the industry's objection to the MOF's position is a fear that  "the rate differential between the ordinary bank deposit and  postal savings might further widen and thereby cause a shift of  even more funds from one to the other" (words of the planning  officer at a leading city bank). As a matter of fact, in fiscal  1993 regular postal savings, contemptuously outdistancing the  stagnant ordinary deposit in commercial banks, recorded the  highest growth ever.    Early in February, an economic research institute affiliated  with another major bank completed an "internal use only" report.  The report contains a coolheaded analysis of the relationship,  prone to be emotionally antagonistic, between the bank and the  postal savings; not only does the report give equal airing to  the positions of the Federation of Bankers Associations of Japan  and the MOPT on each point at issue, it also attempts to assess  the present situation from an objective standpoint.  <H5>  The State's Credit Standing Not Reflected </H5>   Deserving of particular attention is the portion of the  report dealing with the rivalry between the postal savings  program and the bank. In reference to postal savings, while the  bankers federation calls it "a privileged entity" and even those  managing it take a subjective view that "being a government  enterprise, it is subject to many restrictions," the report in  question coolly points out that "(the level of interest rate on  postal savings) does not reflect the state's credit standing."  The report takes this position because determination of  interest rates on the basis of credit standings is a major  principle of the free financial market.    Article 3 of the Postal Savings Law stipulates: "The state  guarantees the repayment of the money deposited into the postal  savings account and the payment of interest on such savings."  In a sense, postal savings are a deposit with the highest  credit standing within the country. If sound market mechanisms  were at work, the common-sense view is that it should suffice to  pay low interest to the users of the postal savings system.  Historically, however, it has been the other way around. For  more than 40 years since April 1952, the rate differential  between regular postal savings and ordinary bank deposits has  never gone below the 1.0 percent level. This means that "a  strange situation from the standpoint of financial common sense"  (words of an "old boy" of the MOF Banking Bureau) has been kept  in place.    Because of the tight fiscal situation of the general account  section of the budget, the Trust Fund Bureau is being subjected  to ever-increasing demands for funds. As of the end of February  1994, the postal savings system had deposited 181 trillion yen  in the Trust Fund Bureau, the sum equivalent to 56 percent of  Trust Fund Bureau's total liabilities. The more the role of  fiscal investment and loan programs expands, the more necessary  it would become to maintain the fund collection power of the  postal savings system. For this reason, the interest rate on  postal savings cannot be held down too low. The aformentioned  MOF's proposal was seen by those of the private-sector financial  world as a move "to subjugate the setting of interest rates to  the logic of fiscal operations."    A big problem the Trust Fund Bureau has is the existence of  a  disparity between the real interest paid on funds procured  (i.e., interest paid on postal savings) and the interest earned  from fund operations (i.e., interest earned on fiscal  investments). For example, for a period of two years and three  months from January 1990, the interest rates on regular postal  savings stayed at high levels between 2.16 percent and 3.48  percent, while the fiscal investment interest rate (the same as  the deposit rate) remained at 2.0 percent (for a period of more  than one month but less than three months). This negative  spread surfaces as a deficit in the Postal Savings Special  Account.  <H5>  Application of Market Forces Needed </H5>   The principle of allowing the rates on deposits of  accounting  officers to change in tandem with the movement of interest rates  on the market has been introduced, but this applies only to  long-term deposits of seven years or more. The rates on short-  and medium-term deposits of less than seven years are still  hardly reflective of market interest rates. Some people are  saying: "No matter how deregulated the rates on postal savings  may be, as long as the interest rates on fiscal investments and  on the deposits of accounting officers are kept detached from  the movement of market interest rates, the problem will not be  resolved.    As the deregulation of interest rates progresses, it is  possible that the postal savings system will have to bear a  higher cost than before in order to collect funds. Furthermore,  lending at low rates under the slogan of "policy-guided finance"  will further exacerbate the Trust Fund Bureau's contradiction  known as a "negative spread." The secretariat of the Committee  on Andit in the upper house of the Diet analyzes the situation  this way: "The postal savings system is prone to red ink. Its  structure is such that it will not be able to raise funds unless  the rates on deposits are either set higher or increased on a  continuing basis."    The postal savings issue, as a point of "entry" into the  question of the Trust Fund Bureau fund, is not merely a problem  of rivalry with the private-sector financial institutions.  Simply discussing the rate differential between postal savings  and bank deposits and the marketability of "fixed-amount  savings" as a new product will not lead to a fundamental  solution. The following is a fair statement: "The situation has  reached a point where a new kind of fiscal investment system  must be introduced--a system that makes full use of market  forces, including the deregulation of interest rates relevant to  the Trust Fund Bureau's procurement and investment of funds"  (words of a leading official of a long-term credit bank). To  the Trust Fund Bureau system, the fiscal investment system, and  the postal savings system as a whole, financial deregulation is  the biggest Achilles' heel right now.  <H5>  [7 Apr 94 p 7] </H5>   [Text] Ballooning Lending by "Government Banks":  Outdoing the Private Sector Qualitatively and Quantitatively    "If given (from the government) as much interest subsidy as  400 billion yen (the amount given to the Housing Loan  Corporation), we in the private sector, too, can offer  competitive interest rates." With private-sector financial  institutions unable to increase their lending activity even if  they wanted to, the vice president of a certain city bank, who  made the above remarks, looked bitter about the growing volume  of housing loans being issued by the Housing Loan Corporation.  <H5>  The Public Sector's Share Exceeds 50 Percent </H5>   For fiscal 1993, government subsidies given to  government-affiliated financial institutions out of the general  account funds are estimated to have reached some 560 billion  yen. Of the total, the largest portion--400 billion yen--went  to the Housing Loan Corporation, followed by more than 100  billion yen to the Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries Finance  Corporation. In the case of the Housing Loan Corporation, the  subsidy it received, if calculated in terms of interest, was  equivalent to 0.7 percent. Which means that they were able to  reduce their lending interest rate by that much. Similarly, in  the case of the Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries Finance  Corporation, the subsidy was equivalent to 1.9 percent of its  lending rate.    From 11 April on, city banks' housing loans will carry a  fixed interest rate of 5.82 percent. Between this and the  standard rate (4.05 percent annual) charged by the Housing Loan  Corporation, there is a differential of nearly 2 percent. What  has happened is that "market forces are not working in the field  of housing financing" (a leading official of a ranking city  bank).    On the strength of their overwhelming advantageous lending  terms, government-affiliated financial institutions are doing a  ballooning business in making loans. According to Bank of Japan  statistics, the government-affiliated financial institutions,  comprised of two banks, one of which is Japan Development Bank,  and nine finance corporations, including the Housing Loan  Corporation, had as of the end of January 1994 outstanding loan  balances totaling slightly less than 118 trillion yen, which  represented 11-percent growth from a year earlier. During the  same period, total lending by all banks nationwide grew only by  0.1 percent.    The share of public lending, too, has gradually increased.  According to the Bank of Japan's "flow of funds accounts," of  the fiscal 1992 growth in combined lending by the private sector  and public finance institutions, the share of public lending was  more than one half--53 percent to be specific. The share  apparently increased even more in fiscal 1993. The share of  government-affiliated financial institutions alone was 22  percent, but it has been growing for these past few years. It  appears that "public financing, originally meant to play a  supporting role only, has assumed the leading role." This is  due in part to the increased lending by government-affiliated  financial institutions in order to stimulate the economy.    Those of the private sector are rebellious--they are  complaining: "government-affiliated institutions, whose  intrinsic role should be to complement the private sector, have  come barging into the field of lending which the private sector  is capable of handling." According to a survey by a major bank,  more than half of the loans issued by the Japan Development Bank  are concentrated on 30 business firms that are among the top  loan customers of private-sector financial institutions.  Although in form these government-affiliated institutions are  still sticking with project financing which is supposed to be  handled on a case-by-case basis, they are said to be  disproportionately concentrating their lending to "just those  big companies whose borrowing needs can be fully accommodated by  the private sector as well."  <H5>  Target Criteria for Lending Broadened </H5>   In order to give preferential treatment to those projects  that meet policy objectives, government-affiliated financial  institutions have in place a system of "special interest rates"  that are lower than the standard rates. This explains why  private-sector financing officers are saying that they are  "unable to compete with government-affiliated financial  institutions when it comes to lending terms." Although it is  not disclosed as to what percentage of the lending by  government-affiliated financial institutions is at such special  rates, the realistic sense of the private sector is that the  percentage "is increasing quite a bit."    The Japan Development Bank Law was revised in 1972, 1985,  and  1991. Each revision led to a broadening of the scope of lending  criteria. Lending for alternative energy projects began in 1980  and for improvement of key railways and augmentation of  industrial structure in 1987. More recently, a loan program has  been initiated for the purpose of promoting energy-saving  equipment investment. All this means that government-affiliated  financial institutions have become hypertrophied not only  quantitatively but also qualitatively.    But there are recent indications that some among the  government-affiliated financial institutions, whose lending has  been rapidly increasing, are leaving some of the fiscal  investment funds allocated to them unspent. As a result of the  repeated countercyclical measures that significantly expanded  the lending limits of government-affiliated financial  institutions, some of these institutions are saying: "However  much we lend, we seem perpetually unable to fully digest our  lending limits" (a leading official of a certain  government-affiliated financial institution).    According to a survey conducted by financial quarters on the  basis of government-affiliated financial institutions' own  statements of accounts and audit reports on their statements,  the delinquency ratio of the loans issued by these institutions  was 0.5 percent as of fiscal 1991. That ratio, though healthy  in comparison with the private-sector ratio which had risen to  about 3 percent on an average, has been on an uptrend.  <H5>  Specialization in Augmentation of Infrastructure </H5>   "Given the need to increase public investment so as to  digest  excess savings, there should be a role to fulfill for fiscal  investment agencies," says Hirohiko Okumura, research director  of the Nomura Research Institute. According to him, even though  Japan's capital flow is bulging with funds from such sources as  life insurance and pension programs--the kind of money which  ought to be utilized for long-term investment, such funds are  being utilized only for short-term investment simply because  short-term real interest rates are higher. He also says that  the failure to channel the funds, which should be used for  repleting infrastructure, to long-term investment is hampering  growth of the Japanese economy.    Intrinsically, government-affiliated financial institutions  are charged with the task of providing funds to such projects  which are difficult for private-sector financial institutions to  handle. Thus, it seems even reasonable to say that for  government-affiliated financial institutions to take the road of  specialization in the financing of large-scale infrastructure  augmentation projects that preclude competition with the private  sector would, in the final analysis, lead to the redressing of  the distortians now occurring in the flow of funds.  <H5>  [8 Apr 94 p 7] </H5>   [Text] Absence of Fund Manager Leads Safety,  Effectiveness of Fiscal Investment To Go Askew    In his domestic speech delivered on 23 March, Under  Secretary  of Treasury Summers of the U.S. Government raised the subject of  opening up the "assets management" market as an item to be  demanded of Japan. Clearly, by "assets management" he was  referring to the investment management of public pension funds;  it is also clear that he was demanding the lifting of Japan's  ban on entrusting its public pension funds to investment  advisory firms for management. Mr. Summers' position on this  subject is substantially the same as a standing demand of the  Ministry of Health and Welfare [MHW] to the MOF; therefore, it  is bound to prove to be a powerful reinforcement to the MHW  whose negotiations with the MOF are having tough going.  <H5>  An Annual Profit Margin of 3 Percent </H5>   The welfare pension and national pension reserve funds are  placed in trust with the Trust Fund Bureau, from whom the  Pension Welfare Service Public Corporation [PWSPC, which is  supervised by the MHW] borrows some of the funds for investment  purposes. In other words, the PWSPC is engaged in independent  investment activities using the Trust Fund Bureau fund; the  amount of money so invested was roughly 19.5 trillion yen as of  the end of fiscal 1993. At present, the PWSPC is allowed to  consign such investment activities to life insurance companies  and trust companies only; however, it is the contention of the  MHW and the U.S. Government that the consigness should be  expanded to include investment advisory firms.    But this independent investment program using public pension  funds has been a losing proposition on a continuing basis. Due,  among other things, to the falling stock prices, the investment  yield has been less than the interest paid on the money borrowed  from the Trust Fund Bureau; the program apparently ended fiscal  1993 in the red for the third time in as many years. These  investment losses cut into the reserve funds; however, despite  such poor performances, the MHW shows no signs of weakening its  demand for an expansion of the independent investment program.    There is a trial calculation made by the PWSPC. It shows  that during the 20-year period from fiscal 1973 to fiscal 1992  the combined value of the prices of and dividends accrued from  all stocks listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange increased at an  average annual rate of 9.65 percent, while the borrowing  interest rate from the Trust Fund Bureau averaged at 6.65  percent. Granted, stock prices fell in some of those years;  still, over the long haul, investments in that period should  have enjoyed a 3-percent profit margin, mathematically.    The PWSPC is confident that "the efficiency of the  independent investment program would improve if funds were  invested for longer terms and through diversified consigness who  would have to compete harder." According to the MHW, due to  sharply rising annuity payments there is a probability that by  fiscal 2025 the welfare pension insurance premium could balloon  to 29.6 percent (to be split 50-50 between the employer and the  employee; currently 14.5 percent) of the worker's monthly pay.  The MHW is adamant about the merit of the independent  investment program, saying that the program's success would add  to pension reserve funds and thereby "lessen the burdens on the  people."  <H5>  Expansion Conceals Debts </H5>   But the MOF's position is that "investment in stocks could  very well hurt the stability of the pension funds" (the  ministry's Financial Bureau). The position reflects the MOF's  desire to maintain its influence over the pension funds, but  there is more to it than that: the same line of thinking governs  the MOF's posture vis-a-vis the Ministry of Posts and  Telecommunications, which is also seeking an expansion of its  independent investment authority over the postal savings fund.  Because postal savings and pension funds must sooner or later  be refunded or paid out as benefits, it is only natural to  demand that their investment management be safe and secure. But  this logic, preached by the Trust Fund Bureau, is being violated  by the Trust Fund Bureau itself.    A typical example of the Trust Fund Bureau's fund  management,  which is anything but safe and secure, is the lending to the  National Railway Settlement Corporation which inherited the  liabilities of the former National Railways. This settlement  corporation is saddled with liabilities exceeding 20 trillion  yen; yet, because of the difficulty in selling land assets, also  inherited from the old National Railways, the corporation must  borrow huge sums of money just to make interest payments on  debts. For fiscal 1994, the Trust Fund Bureau plans to provide  the corporation more than 1.2 trillion yen out of the fiscal  investment fund; some are calling this planned funding  "additional lending pure and simple, designed to preserve the  old debt" (a major city bank).    The Trust Fund Bureau is also planning 280 billion yen of  fiscal investment fund into the National Forest Service Special  Account, which is perpetually in the red, to help repay loans.  Meanwhile, nonperforming loans on the books of  government-affiliated financial institutions are increasing  sharply. If the money tied up in all these fiscal investments  by the Trust Fund Bureau cannot be recovered, the resulting  losses will have to be covered with the general-account funds.  In other words, ultimately it is the people's tax money that  must come to the rescue of such losses; in this sense, the Trust  Fund Bureau's fiscal investment program is even riskier than the  aforementioned independent investment of pension funds.    As the fiscal investment program grows to take over more of  the funding activities normally covered under the general  acccount, the number of agencies receiving such fiscal  investments has also increased. At present there are 61  institutions on the receiving end of the fiscal investment  program--more than a fourfold increase during these past 40  years; it is not incorrect to say that hidden behind such an  easy expansion of this program are national debts.  <H5>  Reorganization of Investment Outlets Essential </H5>   Looking at it as a whole, the fiscal investment program is  structured to operate on a "negative interest margin": On the  procurement side, its funds are raised at high interest rates;  on the investment side, its funds so raised are lent out through  government-affiliated financial institutions at lower interest  rates for policy reasons. It is only natural, therefore, that  there be a demand for higher investment efficiency to make up  for the negative spread; however, as long as the program is  devoid of "fund managers" capable of investing the funds safely  and profitably, chances are the program will grow even more awry.    The Japan Research Institute points out: "To reform the  fiscal investment program, investment agencies must be  reorganized as the first step." Given the outlook for a  declining inflow of money into pension funds, for example, a  review of the investment outlets is a must in the interest of  curtailing easy-going investments and loans; also, such a review  has a bearing on the question of clearly differentiating the  role of financial administration and that of fiscal investment.  Reorganization and consolidation of the investment outlets is  an integral part of the administrative reform itself which is  hardly making progress; nevertheless, that is where a surgical  knife must be applied if the ailing fiscal investment system is  to be saved.  <H5>  [9 Apr 94 p 6] </H5>   [Text] How should the Trust Fund Bureau, which has  grown markedly creaky, be reformed in order to bring it in line  with the new era? In search of the answer to this question, we  at the NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN sought the views of senior economist  [Atsushi] Miyawaki of the Japan Research Institute, who is  conversant with this subject area.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] What do you think are the biggest  problems relative to the Trust Fund Bureau and its fiscal  investment and loan program?    [Miyawaki] The Trust Fund Bureau has forgotten the basic  fact that its financial resources made up of postal savings and  pension insurance premiums are assets of the people. When  individuals place their money in trust with an investment agent,  they naturally expect the agent to invest the money profitably;  also, they are kept informed by the agent as to where and how  their money is being invested. This does not obtain in the case  of the Trust Fund Bureau, however.    The amounts of money allocated to public corporations, some  called "Kosha" and others called "Kodan," are made public;  however, the details are obscure as to where exactly the postal  savings money and pension funds placed in the Trust Fund  Bureau's care have ended up. Especially when it comes to  short-term use of the Trust Fund Bureau fund, the picture is  like a "black box": not clear are even such details as the  purpose of outlay and the balance between outlay and revenue.    Moreover, the Trust Fund Bureau fund is being used  increasingly of late to cover budget deficits and for financial  juggling between the central government and local jurisdictions  or between the treasury and special accounts. For instance, the  Trust Fund Bureau fund is being used by government-affiliated  financial institutines to make loans which from the beginning  can be expected to be irrecoverable to some extent as in the  case of the loans issued by the Export-Import Bank of Japan that  have taken on more and more of the foreign aid character. Such  use of the Trust Fund Bureau fund can hardly be termed as  profitable and safe investments.  <H5>  Interest Subsidies to the Private Sector </H5>   [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] But the fiscal investment program has  the role of providing funds for those purposes which the private  sector cannot accommodate. Isn't there some aspect of the  program which cannot be helped even if it violates the principle  of profitable investment?    [Miyawaki] Indeed there is. But even then, should there be  so many fiscal investment agencies as there are at present? One  cannot ignore the costs required to operate these agencies and  to pay their personnel expenses.    For example, the policy objective of providing low-interest  loans to home buyers can be fulfilled without the presence of  the Housing Loan Corporation. Home buyers seeking loans from  the Housing Loan Corporation usually go through the windows of  private-sector financial institutions. This being the case, all  it takes is to give private-sector financial institutions  interest subsidies and let them make low-interest loans using  their own funds to individual home buyers. Application of the  same interest-subsidy program would make it possible to  accommodate the functions of such other government-affiliated  financial institutions as the Small Business Finance  Corporation, whose rivalry with private-sector institutions has  been on the rise.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Do you think that the Trust Fund  Bureau's financial resources will continue to increase  satisfactorily in the days ahead?    [Miyawaki] That outlook is quite opaque. In the case of  pension funds, clearly it will be diminishing. It is the  balance between the pension insurance premiums paid in and  annuities paid out that is placed in trust with the Trust Fund  Bureau; as a result of society's progressive aging, the yearly  inflow of premiums to pension funds currently amounting to 5-6  trilion yen is expected to shrink to a mere 1 trillion yen or so  by 2010. Thus, the Trust Fund Bureau will necessarily be  obliged to rely on postal savings as its only source of funds;  however, given the ongoing trend toward financial diregulation,  it remains to be seen whether or not the postal savings system  will continue to be able to absorb funds in terms more favorable  than the private sector's.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] How best do you suggest a surgical  knife be applied to the Trust Fund Bureau?  <H5>  Introduction of Fiscal-Investment Bonds Would Be Effective </H5>   [Miyawaki] First of all, the Trust Fund Bureau should stop  using its funds for those objectives which can more  appropriately be covered by tax money or government bond. Any  money used to make up for the deficits incurred by the National  Railway Settlement Corporation, the National Forest Service  Special Account, etc. is money that will never come back.    For medium- and long-term purposes, the Trust Fund Bureau  should classify its funding activities into "class-A fiscal  investments," which are to be funded with funds recovered from  previous investments, and "class-B fiscal investments," which  are to be funded with new revenues expected in the future.  Regarding the "class-A fiscal investments," funding levels  should be reduced to those agencies engaged in such projects  which can be handled competitively by the private sector, and  should limit all new investment targets to the development of  high-risk technologies and the augmentation of life-related  infrastructure. As for the "class-B fiscal investments," the  Trust Fund Bureau should aim for profitable investments just  like life insurance companies and other private-sector  institutional investors are doing.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] How should the effort proceed to  rationalize public corporations and other fiscal investment  agencies?    [Miyawaki] One idea would be to introduce a scheme whereby  all such agencies are to issue fiscal investment bonds as a  means to raise their own funds. Under such a scheme,  ineffective agencies will only be able to raise funds at a high  cost and therefore their very existence will be threatened. In  this sense, the principle of competition will be put to work as  well under such a scheme. Of course, to those agencies that  must perform a social role, the idea of giving them interest  subsidies out of the general account funds may be entertained.</p>

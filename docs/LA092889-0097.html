			<p><P> September 28, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TOXIC CLEAN-UP ISSUE DELAYS PROJECT;  </P> <P> MARINA DEL REY CONDOS SHOULDN'T BE AFFECTED, DEVELOPERS INSIST  </P> <P> It is 1992 in Marina del Rey, and a bunch of workers in moon suits shows up  next door to a pricey, new 96-unit condo project. They are not men from Mars  but workers assigned to clean up toxic waste discarded there 20 years ago.  </P> <P> "The homeowners will be in the middle of a state Superfund cleanup," said  environmental attorney Barry Groveman, who posed the above scenario in an  interview. "There's going to be bloody hell to pay."  </P> <P> Groveman, who represents an industrial property owner in the area, last week  raised those concerns to the Los Angeles City Planning Commission, arguing that  an environmental impact report is necessary.  </P> <P> He persuaded the commissioners to delay -- at least for three weeks -- plans to  build luxury condos across the street from the movie-theater end of the Marina  Marketplace at Glencoe and Maxella avenues, plans that a lot of people had  hoped to see approved.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Approval Withheld  </P> <P> The commission, on the advice of the city attorney's office, withheld final  approval of the project to reconsider its environmental ramifications. The  matter is back on the commission's agenda Oct. 14.  </P> <P> The project is unusual in that the developers' biggest boosters are homeowner  groups from the four phases of the nearby Villa Marina condominiums, who favor  residential over commercial development. Developers Jeffrey Rosen and Paul  Plotkin consulted with residents even before buying the property, and the final  plan is a group effort.  </P> <P> Paul Doebler, a Villa Marina resident who lives across the street from the  proposed condominiums, told the commissioners at a crowded public hearing: "We  do not see the hazard."  </P> <P> Paul Novak, a consultant for the developers, said the participants should be  rewarded for "one of the few successful examples of developer-homeowner  cooperation."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Endorsed Project  </P> <P> Councilwoman Ruth Galanter has endorsed the project in a letter to the  commission. Galanter's planning deputy, Jim Bickhart, said in an interview that  the site has to be cleaned up but that this should not interfere with the  project.  </P> <P> Another representative of the developer denounced Groveman for using what he  called terrorist tactics to stall the development. Attorney Lawrence Straw Jr.  said Groveman's references to "toxics and PCBs" were "merely an attempt to  create some hysteria."  </P> <P> Groveman, a former environmental-crime prosecutor and one of the authors of  Proposition 65, the Clean Water Act, said the site next to the proposed  condominium project was contaminated with industrial solvents called PCBs  (polychlorinated biphenols) and other toxic substances by Cornell-Dubulier  Electronics, which operated there until 1971. He said the site is on the state  Superfund cleanup list and is scheduled to be cleaned up in 1992.  </P> <P> Developer Plotkin charged that Groveman is lying about the severity of the  problem, which he and his consultants insist will not be worsened by  construction of the condos 300 feet away.  </P> <P> Plotkin's partner, Rosen, said: "Essentially, the toxic issue is truly a  non-issue with respect to our proposed project. It's being used to keep  residential development out of the area."  </P> <P> According to Novak, an environmental impact report is unnecessary.  </P> <P> Groveman, however, said such a report is legally mandated. If one is not  forthcoming, he said, he is prepared to seek a court injunction.  </P> <P> To proceed otherwise is "irresponsible and reckless," Groveman said. "We're not  saying, 'Don't build.' We're saying, 'What's the hurry to do it in 10 days?' "  </P> <P> Both sides point to consultants' reports that back up their claims. They argue  over why the cleanup has been delayed to 1992, and the developers charge that  Groveman has puffed up the toxic issue when his real aim is to protect his  client's option to buy the property on which the toxics sit.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Potential Liability  </P> <P> Groveman readily concedes that he is trying to protect his client from  potential liability from lawsuits from irate condominium owners looking for  someone to blame.  </P> <P> But he insists that his example of men in moon suits arriving in 1992 is the  most likely scenario. Even if further study determines that the contaminants  will probably not be spread by construction, the PCBs and other toxics are  scheduled to be removed.  </P> <P> Their removal is bound to trigger legal actions from people who have paid  $500,000 for a condominium without being aware of the problem beforehand,  Groveman said.  </P> <P> He said PCBs are among the most toxic of contaminants and must be trucked to  disposal sites in Arizona or Texas.  </P> <P> A 1988 report prepared by Meredith/Boli &amp; Associates for the electronics  firm responsible for the toxic spill said contaminants were detected in ground  water. The developers' consultants point to findings that the contaminants have  not migrated for 17 years and are unlikely to do so now.  </P> <P> Commercial tenants say a separate issue underlying the controversy is the  encroachment of residential development onto the dwindling number of light  industrial enclaves on the Westside.  </P> <P> "This is an inroad to eradicating light industry in this area," said Kerry  Feldman, owner of Fineline Studios, a tenant in the building closest to the  proposed condominiums.  </P> <P> At the hearing, Feldman said he had just bought a tear-down home in Venice near  his business. He questioned the rationale of urban planning that would  ultimately force businesses such as his to relocate far from home, adding  people like him to commuter freeway traffic.  </P> <P> Feldman said his company's blast furnace operates 24 hours a day, emitting a  "white noise" that he believes will drive the new condo owners to distraction  -- and legal action. "It's the beginning of a battle that will ensue for  years," he said.  </P></p>

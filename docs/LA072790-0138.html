			<p><P> July 27, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SURF COUNTY, USA;  </P> <P> THE LONG RIDERS;  </P> <P> SOME CHANGE FROM BUSINESS SUITS INTO WET SUITS. OTHERS PRACTICALLY LIVE IN THE  WATER. ALL FIND EXCEPTIONAL CHALLENGES AND REWARDS IN THEIR SEARCH FOR THE  PERFECT WAVE.  </P> <P> ERNIE SCHNEIDER  </P> <P> COUNTY ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICER, 43  </P> <P> Tell the Board of Supervisors he's surfin', surfin' USA.  </P> <P> County Administrative Officer Schneider who oversees a $3-billion budget and  16,000 employees, has served almost 20 years in county government -- but he has  surfed for 30.  </P> <P> Although the pressures of job and family have driven many of his friends from  the sport, Schneider gets in the water two to three times a week, despite the  12-hour workdays he puts in for his $110,000-a-year job.  </P> <P> "I am real into sports -- running, handball, weights and triathlons," said  Schneider, who lives in San Clemente. "But I have never stopped surfing. It's  what I do best."  </P> <P> His favorite spot is Church's, a point break north of the San Onofre Nuclear  Power Station. He has been going there with friends since he was a teen-ager.  These days, Schneider usually loads his 7-foot, 10-inch long board into a tan  Volkswagen van shortly after dawn and gets in a few waves before heading to his  executive office at the County Administration Building in Santa Ana.  </P> <P> At Church's he occasionally meets longtime friends such as Chuck Bassett, a  Costa Mesa fire captain. Sometimes, Schneider's wife, Sally, goes along. But  his most consistent surfing companion is son Nick, a talkative 8-year-old with  a tan and crewcut. He attends Truman Benedict Elementary School and started to  snorkle and surf before he was 5.  </P> <P> "I like surfing more than I think I do," Nick said. "I've surfed 10- to 15-foot  waves."  </P> <P> "Well, not exactly," said Schneider, who has a pair of hot-pink surf trunks.  </P> <P> Schneider, a West German immigrant who arrived in New York a few weeks shy of  his sixth birthday, began surfing at age 14, shortly after his parents moved to  Orange County. He eventually earned a slot on the Gordon &amp; Smith exhibition  team when the San Diego surfboard company had a shop in Dana Point.  </P> <P> He said surfing provides him a much-needed break from the pressures of  restructuring the county bureaucracy, dealing with fiscal problems and keeping  track of the minutiae of government.  </P> <P> "Sitting at my desk in the office and sitting on my board," he said, "it's just  two different worlds."

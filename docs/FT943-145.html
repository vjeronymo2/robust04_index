			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Brackenbridge chairman resigns as losses rise The chairman of Bracken-bridge, the USM-quoted bridal and formal wear company has, resigned after less than six months following disagreements over its future direction. The departure of Mr George Wardale, who took up the post on May 23, was 'amicable', the company said. Pre-tax losses for the year to March 31 soared from Pounds 1.57m to Pounds 6.39m. Almost Pounds 4m of the deficit was in respect of writedowns and provisions as part of its reorganisation earlier this year. Turnover slipped 12 per cent from Pounds 16.3m to Pounds 14.3m, including Pounds 2.46m (Pounds 3.05m). Losses per share more were 35.3p (10.1p). Mr Simon Raynaud, the new chairman, said it was now accounting for retail turnover on a cash received basis rather than on business booked. Net assets had reduced substantially as a result.</p>

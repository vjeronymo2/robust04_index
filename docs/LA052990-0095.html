			<p><P> May 29, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THIS AGENT AVOIDS STING OF DEFEAT;  </P> <P> LAW ENFORCEMENT: FBI'S UNDERCOVER HORSE PAYS HIS OWN WAY DURING INVESTIGATION  OF RACE-FIXING AT FINGER LAKES.  </P> <P> An undercover horse the FBI used in an investigation of race-fixing at Finger  Lakes Race Track won at least one race and finished strongly in others, much to  the surprise of the agents.  </P> <P> The FBI bought the horse thinking it would perform badly and could become  involved in a fixed-race scheme. But the horse ran consistently well during the  1989 racing season, Special Agent Dale Anderson said.  </P> <P> "I can say he won at least one race and placed in about half of his races. The  FBI did quite well with him. The bureau made enough money to offset the costs  of upkeep," about $1,000 a month, Anderson told the Buffalo News.  </P> <P> A jockey, two trainers and a trainer's wife face possible indictment in  connection with a Sept. 26 race at the track in Canandaigua, about 20 miles  southeast of Rochester. That race allegedly was fixed, but FBI agents said the  alleged scheme was not related to their main investigation.  </P> <P> The FBI's horse was not running in the suspect race, nor were agents  specifically watching the four persons who were arrested, Anderson said. U.S.  Attorney Dennis C. Vacco said track officials and state regulators noticed  jockey Joseph Badamo was riding his horse irregularly during the race.  </P> <P> G. Robert Langford, special agent in charge of the Buffalo office, said the  investigation left the FBI with the impression that few races are fixed at  Finger Lakes.  </P> <P> The FBI bought the horse for less than $5,000 and ran it at the track to  introduce an undercover agent to the work and social circles of those targeted  in the investigation. The FBI agent played the part of a shady trainer and  horse owner, Anderson said.  </P> <P> Agents considered naming the horse after FBI Director William Sessions and  having it run under the FBI's colors, but those ideas were quickly scrapped.  The horse's name, age and sex are still being kept secret to protect the  identities of those involved with the case.  </P> <P> Now owned privately and still racing, the FBI's horse has put its law  enforcement career behind it.  </P> <P> "We wish him well. He served as a real good representative of the bureau,"  Anderson said.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>Tagalog </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Vietnam has rejected the request of Jose Ma. Sison,  Communist Party of the Philippines chief, to participate in the  peace talks between the government and Communist Party of the  Philippines-New People's Army-National Democratic Front.  Vietnam made it clear that its role in the peace talks is  merely to serve as the host country. The peace talks will be  held in Ho Chi Minh City.    President Ramos also has no plan to ask for Vietnam's help  during his visit to Hanoi next week. Ramos will only thank  Vietnam for agreeing to host the peace talks.</p>

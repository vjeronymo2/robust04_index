			<p><P> July 11, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L. RON HUBBARD'S CHURCH OF SCIENTOLOGY  </P> <P> Your series on Scientology shows how tyrants emerge. We see in Scientology many  of the elements of far more powerful dictatorships: Cults of personality, with  strong emphasis on the "sacred writings" of the leader.  </P> <P> Enrichment of a select few at the top. Disregard of normal standards of public  decency, with critics being denounced as enemies and hounded or attacked  without mercy. A mind-set that exalts supporters as superior to the rest of  humanity. And permeating all, a vindictive self-righteousness that seeks to  turn ordinary people into mere fodder for the use of The Movement.  </P> <P> In America, our laws and traditions of liberty put bounds on the growth of  Scientology and its like, and limit the harm they do. But in nations ruled by  dictators, similar cults or movements break all such bounds, raising quite  ordinary people -- akin in their way to Hubbard -- to the status of gods. Every  society has its people, troubled or naive, who are susceptible to the  blandishments of people such as Hubbard. That is why they continue to come  forth. But in such movements, we see the early beginnings -- fortunately  well-controlled -- of processes that in other lands have led to Ayatollah  Khomeini and Tian An Men Square.  </P> <P> T.A.

Qiao Shi, chairman of the Eighth NPC Standing Committee,  presided over today's meeting and made a speech.    He said the second session of the eighth NPC is extremely  important since it is convened at a time when China is  establishing a socialist market economic structure and marching  on the road of modernization.    He said the session will take Deng Xiaoping's theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's  basic line as its guiding principles. The session, he said,  will implement guidelines mapped out by the 14th National  Congress of the Chinese Communist Party (CPC) and the Third  Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee.    He called for efforts to make the meeting proceed in an  atmosphere marked by democracy, unity, pragmatism and openness.    Today's meeting elected a 163-member presidium and a  secretary- general for the session.    The meeting approved an agenda for the session, which  includes:    --hearing and examining a report on government work;    --hearing and examining a report on the implementation of  the  1993 national economic and social development plan and a draft  plan for 1994;    --hearing and examining a report on the implementation of  the  1993 state budget and a draft budget for 1994;    --examining a draft budget law and a draft decision of the  NPC to empower Xiamen city with legislation power;    --hearing work reports of the NPC Standing Committee, the  Supreme People's Court and the Supreme People's Procuratorate;    --electing new members to the Eighth NPC Standing Committee.

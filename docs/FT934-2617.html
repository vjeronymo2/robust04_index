			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / EU ministers to press ahead with 'action plan' on jobs More than 60 ministers arrive in Brussels today to begin enacting ambitious plans for reviving employment and growth in the European Union and to resolve internal differences over trade. The plans were agreed at the Brussels summit which ended on Saturday with a semblance of political unity and praise for Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission. Leaders adopted Mr Delors' white paper on competitiveness, employment and growth as an 'action plan' to pull Europe out of recession and tackle unemployment. But the summit was overshadowed by disputes over how to meet French and Portuguese objections to a Gatt world trade deal under negotiation in Geneva. Foreign ministers hope to settle these matters at a meeting today in Brussels. Mr Delors said the summit provided a 'relaunch' of the Union's credibility and self-confidence similar to the spirit evoked by the earlier single market programme of the 1980s. EU heads of government have tilted in favour of deregulation, towards the arguments which European industrialists have recently been putting forward. The white paper eschews Brussels-led legislation in favour of a menu of non-binding options which take into account each member state's national needs, all within a framework of measured labour market deregulation, macro-economic stability and spending on infrastructure. Today, EU finance ministers will begin discussing the technical aspects of the 'action plan', in particular the macroeconomic guidelines for the next phase of economic and monetary union to begin on January 1. The leaders charged finance ministers with assessing how to raise Ecu8bn (Pounds 6bn) a year of additional finance to fund trans-European networks in transport, energy and telecommunications. The summit blunted European Commission hopes of being given the go-ahead to raise the money through an issue of 'Union bonds'. But Commission officials said the broad principle of spending on infrastructure had been endorsed by all 12 member states, including Germany and the UK. EU leaders also agreed to hold a special meeting of foreign ministers on December 22 in which to put pressure on the warring parties in former Yugoslavia.

			<p><P> August 21, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MARKETING: EVERYTHING OLD IS NEW AGAIN IN SOME TELEVISION COMMERCIALS  </P> <P> It sure sounds like a new TV spot. The music and narration are brand-spanking  new. To casual viewers, it could almost look like a fresh commercial, too.  </P> <P> But those who look more closely at Nike's newest TV spot -- filled with  favorite moments from past "Just Do It" commercials -- might think that they've  seen it all before. And they're right. The commercial is basically a mishmash  of short scenes from past Nike ads. The octogenarian jogger. The athlete in a  wheelchair. A younger Andre Agassi. They're all there again.  </P> <P> "We didn't do it with the intention of saving money," Nike spokeswoman Liz  Dolan said. "We did it because people keep asking us if they could see these  scenes again."  </P> <P> Whatever its intent, Nike saved a bundle on the ad. Ad executives estimate that  it costs five times more to film a new commercial than to edit used footage  into what appears to be a new ad. In this ad, they estimate, Nike may have  saved up to $500,000 in production costs.  </P> <P> As advertisers continue to look for ways to cut costs, plenty are latching on  to this seemingly simple formula: Make the old look new. Amusement parks,  including Disneyland, Knott's Berry Farm and Sea World, are increasingly  splicing scenes from old commercials and pasting them into new ones. So are  retailers, including McDonald's, Lucky Stores, C&amp;R Clothiers and Home  Depot, to name a few.  </P> <P> "Everyone is concerned about budgets these days," said Phil Labhart, whose Los  Angeles production company, Labhart Production Group, has shot and re-edited  ads for Sea World. "It costs so much to shoot a commercial that it only makes  sense to see if you can go back, re-edit it and get a new one for a fraction of  the cost."  </P> <P> Ad executives say they are increasingly being pressured by clients to save on  production costs. And with good reason. It is sometimes more expensive to  produce the commercials than the TV shows on which they appear. Many  commercials require production crews of more than 20 people -- including camera  operators, art directors, lighting specialists, wardrobe and makeup experts.  </P> <P> "The tighter times get, the more clients expect this sort of thing," said Miles  Turpin, chairman of Grey Advertising's Western division, which creates ads for  Lucky Stores. "If you spend too much on production, you're reducing the amount  of dollars to broadcast your message."  </P> <P> Grey keeps its own library of film from past Lucky commercials. It pulls out  whatever short scenes it needs when Lucky runs promotional specials on grocery  items such as produce. "These ads don't run very long," Turpin explained. "So  they don't justify a big expense."  </P> <P> Sea World is among the biggest users of this sort of advertising. A TV  commercial pushing nighttime visits to Sea World that has been running in Los  Angeles and San Diego features footage that is several years old.  </P> <P> "We don't have different model years of killer whales," said Tom Olson, vice  president of marketing at San Diego-based Sea World of California. "Certainly,  with the rise in production expenses we're anxious to use stuff we don't have  to refilm." In fact, all four Sea World parks share commercial footage.  </P> <P> Ditto for Disneyland. Its current spot for the park's 35th anniversary is  filled mostly with 2 1/2-year-old footage of its famous nighttime Electrical  Parade. "It wouldn't make sense to spend a whole bunch of money to recreate  that," said Henry Caroselli, director of creative services for Walt Disney Co.  </P> <P> Instead, the company filmed some scenes of the parade's new 35th anniversary  float and edited it into the ad. "It's essentially the same commercial  freshened up," Caroselli said.  </P> <P> And a TV promotion that Knott's Berry Farm recently ran for Camp Snoopy was  mostly filled with stock footage that the amusement park's agency, Davis, Ball  &amp; Colombatto, had on hand. That probably saved $50,000 in production costs,  said Brad Ball, president of the agency.  </P> <P> Perhaps no one believes more strongly in reusing old footage in new ads than  Jack Roth, president of Admarketing. "I think it's something that should be  done all the time," he said. Some commercials that Admarketing recently created  for its client, men's store C&amp;R Clothiers, not only feature new faces but  also scenes with several men from its old ads.  </P> <P> But Roth insists that the motive wasn't just to save on production costs. One  striking model who appeared in past ads as a weightlifter is clearly a favorite  among viewers. "If we hadn't used his segment again," said Roth, "there  probably would have been a backlash."  </P> <P> </P> <P> New Agency Cracks Open Egg Account  </P> <P> If Madison Avenue can make red meat sound healthy, why not eggs?  </P> <P> The California Egg Commission awarded its $4.5-million ad account to the agency  Davis, Ball &amp; Colombatto last week. "We're going to attack the health issue  head-on," said Brad Ball, president of the Los Angeles agency.  </P> <P> The slogan "2,000-mile-old eggs" has been dumped, along with the agency that  created it, Asher/Gould. By January, look for TV and print ads that address the  cholesterol issue and promote healthier ways of eating eggs.  </P> <P> Certainly, California egg sales need a boost. They have slipped steadily for  the past three years, said Robert Pierre, commission president. Ball, whose  agency also creates ads for McDonald's Operators of Southern California, thinks  that he knows how his agency won the business. Before its presentation to the  egg commission late last week, it served Egg McMuffins to some 20 executives.  "I told them, if they didn't eat eggs, how could they expect the general public  to," Ball said. Every McMuffin was gobbled.  </P> <P> </P> <P> C&amp;R to Sponsor Hunk Competition  </P> <P> C&amp;R Clothiers is looking for a few good men.  </P> <P> Sometime in mid-September, the Culver City men's clothing chain will sponsor a  Southern California competition for men to appear in ads. C&amp;R's commercials  feature hunks who might be lifting weights one second, then wearing fancy suits  the next. They do this to the tune, "What a Difference a Day Makes." The  year-old campaign has resulted in a flood of inquiries from women who want  their husbands, boyfriends and sons to appear in the ads.  </P> <P> "It's become a phenomenon," said Jack Roth, president of Admarketing, the  agency that created the campaign.  </P> <P> The rules for the contest are yet to be determined -- but entry forms will be  available at C&amp;R Clothiers stores sometime in September. Winners will  appear in C&amp;R commercials next spring.  </P> <P> Alas, no female contestants, please. C&amp;R only sells men's fashions. Of  course, there's always Admarketing's women's clothing client -- Clothestime.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hot Account Prospect on Ice Indefinitely  </P> <P> The review for one of the West Coast's most sought-after pieces of advertising  business, the $30-million New Line Cinema account, has been indefinitely  postponed.  </P> <P> "We do not expect to make any decision this year," said Sandra J. Ruch,  president of marketing for the film company that released the hit film  "Teen-Age Mutant Ninja Turtles" and most recently "Metropolitan." For now, the  media-buying account remains with New York-based Independent Media Service.  </P> <P> Nearly a dozen agencies -- about half from Los Angeles -- participated in the  review. But New Line executives have more pressing things on their minds. Last  month, New Line moved from New York to Beverly Hills. It has since hired a  dozen new employees in its marketing department, and it has been busy preparing  five new films for release.  </P> <P> Is the agency review dead? To that, Ruch says only, "We may not make any more  changes."  </P> <P> </P> <P> It's Tahiti Revisited for L.A. Ad Agency  </P> <P> About the only thing better than winning a trip to Tahiti may be winning the  Tahiti Tourist Board's $2.5-million advertising account.  </P> <P> William C. Vogel has won both. His Los Angeles agency, Vogel Communications,  which lost the account to Davis, Ball &amp; Colombatto nearly two years ago,  has won it back and will launch a new print campaign in September.  </P> <P> Gone is its recent ad slogan, "Two hours beyond Hawaii, 50 years behind it."  That will be replaced by "A vacation of a different color," which promotes  Tahiti's attractions by labeling them with different colors: true blue, for  example, for the sea and sky.  </P></p>

			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / Observer: Flagwaver It sounds like Geoffrey Martin, the acting head of the European Commission's London outpost, has finally got the job as the EC's official London flagwaver. A year has passed since John Drew quit the job and there has been strong pressure to reserve the post for a friendly Tory MEP who failed to win re-election next month. Martin, 53, an Ulsterman, is not the normal kind of Brussels bureaucrat. He was president of the National Union of Students while at Belfast's Queen's University, then ran the housing charity, Shelter, and worked for the Commonwealth Secretariat before joining the Commission. A European-friendly equivalent of Des Wilson, perhaps?</p>

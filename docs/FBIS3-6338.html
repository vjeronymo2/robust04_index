The truck belongs to  Thammawutkan Transport Company. Mr. Thawin Pawaratphichit,  owner of the company, informed the police that the truck and its  driver disappeared on 11 March. The police inspected the truck  and found a large water container connected with electrical  wires. The police rescue unit was asked to disconnect the  wires. Master Sergeant Somkiat Nakon told reporters that the  explosive is C-4 buried in ammonium nitrate mixed with diesel  oil, and it could have been powerful if detonated. He said:    [Begin Somkiat recording] The bomb was connected to almost a  complete circuit and was ready to explode if someone pushed the  switch. The local police opened the water tank and shoveled off  the fertilizer. After seeing electrical wires, they called my  unit in and I disconnected the wires. [end recording]    The truck was later driven into Lumpini Park, which was not  crowded during the daytime. The operation to defuse the  explosive was observed by a large crowd. The authorities found  three pounds of C-4 explosives and 14 detonators. A dead male  body wrapped in a plastic sheet was then found at the bottom of  the water tank. Police Major General Nithat Sawettanan, the  commander of the Southern Metropolitan Police Commission, said  that Thawin rented his truck to foreigners for 12,000 baht on 9  March. The truck was to load cargo at Makro wholesale center in  the Bangkapi area on 10 March. The driver telephoned Thawin on  the same day and said that he had already received the money,  but then was not heard from since. But on 11 March, the truck  was involved in an accident with a motorcycle in front of  Central Chitlom department store. The driver was a foreigner  who disappeared after paying for the damage to the motorcycle.  Police authorities later drove the truck to the police station.    A police expert disclosed that if detonated in the open air,  the destruction could extend as far as one kilometer. The  police believe that the production of this large bomb needed  five or six hours and a secluded area, possibly the department  store's underground parking lot or a nearby place.    Lieutenant General Chaiyasit Kanchanakit of the Metropolitan  Police Commission inspected the truck but refused to comment.  However, many people suspected that the bomb may have been  intended to sabotage several important places such as embassies  in the area.</p>

That was said by  Ghanaian President Jerry Rawlings when he stopped over in Luanda  this morning on his way to Namibia. He was welcomed by National  Assembly Chairman Franca van Dunem, government members, and  officials of the Ghanaian Embassy in Angola.    [Begin Rawlings recording, in English fading into Portuguese  translation] I realize the Angolan war has been provoked by the  National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA].  The winds of democracy blowing over our continent represent a  historic opportunity not only to individual countries, but to  all of them. We ought to do away with ethnic differences because  they create problems, not to the better off, but to the  underprivileged. I think it would be good if we could take this  magnificent opportunity to establish democracy in Africa. We  have no other option. This is our continent and we ought to  work together. [end recording]    President Rawlings then left for Namibia.</p>

			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / People: St Thomas' Matthews defeats Guy's Griffiths A battle between two of Britain's most prominent hospital managers to run the biggest National Health Service trust in London ended in victory yesterday for Tim Matthews, chief executive of St Thomas' hospital. St Thomas' and Guy's hospital trusts are due to amalgamate into a single trust next month. The eventual aim, based on recommendations of the Tomlinson report into London healthcare, is to combine the hospitals on one site. Matthews (left) defeated Peter Griffiths (right), chief executive of Guy's, for the new job. The decision is a severe blow for Griffiths, who gave up the high-flying post of deputy chief executive of the NHS management executive in Whitehall to run Guy's when it became a trust in 1991. It is also a blow for Guy's morale - the hospital has frequently been promoted as the flagship of the government's health reforms and a prototype for other trusts. Lord Hayhoe, who will chair the new combined trust, said yesterday that Tim Matthews' leadership would provide an opportunity to build 'the best hospital in London for patients, staff, teaching and research'. Matthews first task, after getting his senior management team in place this month, will be to develop a strategy for combining St Thomas' and Guy's. The government wants proposals for consolidating services on a single site within six months. It has not yet been decided which location will be chosen. Griffiths, 48, who is expected to leave Guy's soon after the new trust comes into effect next month, said yesterday that he would 'continue to provide the maximum support' in preparing for its launch. 'I have no doubt that working together Guy's and St Thomas' will be a world beating combination,' he said. Matthews, 41, was previously district general manager of Maidstone health authority and manager of the Middlesex hospital. Before that he, like Griffiths, worked in the Department of Health.</p>

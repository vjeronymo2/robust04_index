			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Most companies flout safety laws - In a nutshell Seventy per cent of UK companies admit they are not complying with health and safety legislation 18 months after it came into force, according to Eagle Star, one of the UK's largest employer's liability insurers. Only 30 per cent of the 405 companies surveyed had fully implemented changes required by the workplace safety regulations which came into effect in January 1993. The activities covered were as varied as the use of visual display screens and manual lifting of loads. Eagle Star says companies are running the risk of prosecution and unlimited fines. Moreover, accidents are costing employers 30m lost working days a year.</p>

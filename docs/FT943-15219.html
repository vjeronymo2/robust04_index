			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / Report on Archer probe 'this week' A report on the investigation into Lord Archer's alleged involvement in insider dealing is expected within a week, the Department of Trade and Industry hinted strongly yesterday. The DTI acknowledged the urgency to settle the affair as it came under increasing pressure to provide a full explanation of the circumstances in which it disclosed Lord Archer's name as part of the investigation. Lord Archer publicly fended off questions about the inquiry for the second day running yesterday when he hosted an auction to raise funds for the Globe Theatre replica on London's South Bank. However, Lord Archer's friends have been pressing for an early announcement which they believe will clear his name. Continuing uncertainty about the outcome of the investigation comes at a time of increasing speculation about the ministerial reshuffle, expected shortly. Lord Archer was widely believed to be a candidate for a junior ministerial post, such as sports minister, although his chances of achieving his ambition of succeeding Sir Norman Fowler as Conservative party chairman were not thought to be strong. Mr Major, at the G7 summit in Naples yesterday, refused to say whether Lord Archer would feature in the reshuffle if, as his friends claim, the former party deputy chairman is exonerated by the DTI. The prime minister said the matter must rest with the DTI and the investigators appointed to look into allegations of insider trading. 'I don't think it would be at all right for me to offer any further comment on that whatsoever,' he said. However, if the DTI gives Lord Archer a clean bill of health before the reshuffle is announced, his chances of securing a government post are belived to be the same as they would have been had details of the inquiry remained confidential. The investigation, launched in February, centres on share dealing in Anglia TV during the run-up to an agreed takeover bid which sent shares soaring. Lord Archer's wife, Mary, is a non-executive director of Anglia. The DTI has refused to discuss details of the inquiry, but it is believed to involve a single transaction involving 30,000 shares and a profit of about Pounds 50,000.</p>

			<p><P> July 8, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SKIMMING OF INSURANCE FIRM FUNDS ALLEGED  </P> <P> Key executives of firms affiliated with Coastal Insurance Co. told a  legislative hearing Friday that company officials and agents skimmed millions  of dollars, spinning Coastal earlier this year into a bankruptcy that will  result in a $60-million surcharge on all California auto insurance policies.  </P> <P> Coastal became well known to television viewers for the advertising slogan,  "It's no problem," selling about 200,000 policies by appealing to drivers with  poor records.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lurid Testimony  </P> <P> In nearly two hours of frequently lurid testimony, the three executives made  these principal allegations:  </P> <P>  -- In an effort to build up cash flow and thus add to agents' and executives'  commissions and bonuses, many extremely bad drivers were allowed to misstate  their accident records and the values of their cars to permit sale of policies  that were bound to lead to heavy claims.  </P> <P>  -- Some $40,000 cars were recorded on insurance forms as $20,000 cars under  different model names, and some drivers with three accidents were said to have  had no accidents. This allowed affordable premiums, but saddled Coastal with  undesirable policyholders.  </P> <P>  -- Policies were paid for on a month-by-month basis, yet Coastal executives  accounted for them as if they were paid up for a full year. This grossly  overvalued the company in periodic financial reports to a gullible state  Department of Insurance. Meanwhile, the company paid its agents a full year's  commission on new policies, many of which were canceled after a month or two.  Some of these canceled policies were renewed a month later, and again falsely  projected as if they were annual sales, thus "pyramiding" the fraudulent  reports.  </P> <P>  -- Coastal spent $17.5 million to purchase a sales affiliate, FGS, even though  FGS was badly in debt and its president had a restricted insurance license. It  was the FGS agents who sold thousands of risky policies. Both the inordinately  high commissions paid to FGS agents and huge numbers of claims on these  policies helped drive Coastal into bankruptcy.  </P> <P>  -- As Coastal and its holding company, Advent, reeled into financial problems,  their chief executive officer, Harry Miller, insisted on giving $5 million in  contributions out of company funds to the campaign for an insurance initiative,  Proposition 101, on the 1988 ballot. The initiative received only 13.3% of the  total vote.  </P> <P>  -- While Coastal and its sales affiliates, FGS and Public Insurance Service,  had huge numbers of sales agents, it had very few people to process claims.  There were frequent long claims backlogs, and thousands of telephone calls that  went unanswered. On some occasions, claims calls were even switched by  operators to 900 "pay-for-porn" lines to further exasperate the people calling  for help.  </P> <P>  -- A number of the executives and financial officers of Coastal and its  affiliates were unqualified to be in the insurance business and intentionally  followed practices that led to the debacle. Yet most of these people remain in  the insurance business, sometimes changing the names of their businesses.  </P> <P> Those who testified at the hearing of the Assembly Committee on Finance and  Insurance were Don McMillan, former sales manager of FGS; Stephanie Rager,  former customer service manager at FGS, and Bob Pearlman, former comptroller of  Advent Co.  </P> <P> </P> <P> $60-Million Surcharge  </P> <P> According to subsequent testimony by John W. Gates, executive director of the  California Insurance Guarantee Assn., the agency charged with paying off claims  against bankrupt companies, the surcharge resulting from Coastal's bankruptcy  will be more than $60 million. The policyholders of other insurance companies  are required by law to pay any claims against companies that go bankrupt. The  guarantee association is empowered to raise that money by levying surcharges.  </P> <P> After four hours of hearing witnesses, including two leading Coastal and Advent  executives who did not challenge the testimony but claimed they were not  personally responsible for what had happened, Assemblyman Patrick Johnston  (D-Stockton), chairman of the committee, expressed shock.  </P> <P> He said he feared that unless state insurance regulators exert much closer  scrutiny over such practices in the future, there will be more insurance  company bankruptcies.  </P> <P> After Steve Avgeris, the top executive under Miller in both Coastal and Advent,  had testified that he was only an "office boy" paid $400,000 a year but not  responsible for any of the companies' shortcomings, Johnston expressed  consternation that Avgeris is already involved in a new company selling auto  insurance to substandard drivers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'You're Moving On'  </P> <P> "See, you're moving on, and California policyholders may be stuck with new  bills in the future," the assemblyman said. "They're the ones that will be  hurt."  </P> <P> Avgeris said that actually all he is doing with the new company, Summit  Insurance Services, is directing its advertising. "Otherwise, now I can only go  back to school or run a hamburger stand," the 51-year-old executive said.  </P> <P> However, this did not impress Johnston, who remarked that the lesson of Coastal  was that it was good only in marketing its policies, not in serving claims or  performing any of the other functions of an insurance company. He noted that  the new company Avgeris now works for does not yet have a state license but is  doing business under license of an agent it has hired. The committee had  attempted to subpoena Miller to appear, but could not find him. Johnston said  Miller employees had told a process server that he was in Alaska at an  undisclosed location and that he has not been in California for more than a  month.  </P> <P> Another leading executive subpoenaed to appear, Sid Field of FGS, an executive  who received $17.5 million in payments from Miller, sent a lawyer to the  hearing to say he had not yet been able to consult with his principal attorney  and would appear at a second committee hearing, Aug. 29.  </P> <P> However, Field called The Times after the hearing to say, "I was not  responsible, not in charge" of FGS at the time, after its acquisition by  Coastal, when its agents were allegedly selling risky policies in order to gain  high commissions. "The only thing I was in charge of was advertising," he said.  "I had no ability to make decisions."  </P> <P> The chairman of the board of Advent and Coastal, Gerald Milton, who did  testify, also disclaimed responsibility for what had happened. He said that  Miller had often done things without his permission. For instance, Milton said,  he had told Miller that the terms for buying FGS were "a bad deal," but that  Miller had bought it anyway on the disadvantageous terms.  </P></p>

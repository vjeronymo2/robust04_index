			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 11. Tarantulas (Brachypelma spp.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service has been considering listing additional  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Brachypelma  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> species to address look-alike concerns. As a result of the Service's discussions, a proposal was received from Dr. Robert Wolff of Trinity Christian College, Palos Heights, Illinois, to list all members of the tarantula genus  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Brachypelma  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (also known as  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Euathlus  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Brachypelmides <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) in Appendix II of CITES. Most species of this genus have very limited distributions within the general area of Central America from northern Mexico south into Colombia, and are known only from a very limited geographic region within a single country. The very limited distributions of these species places each in greater danger of possible extinction. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Brachypelma  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> tarantulas are ground-dwelling, burrowing spiders occurring from semi-desert regions, through tropical dry deciduous forests, to tropical moist forests. The red-haired  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Brachypelma  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> tarantulas are very popular as pets. They are long-lived spiders; the females frequently live up to 20 years, with as many as 12 possible years for breeding. The males are only mature for a single breeding season and are heavily preyed upon during their wanderings. Whereas up to 400 individual eggs may be produced in each egg sac, the number of hatchlings surviving to adulthood is extremely small (about 1 percent). Therefore, the loss of mature individuals from a population is a major threat to the species; larger individuals are preferred by the pet trade. Several species in the genus are poorly described or virtually unknown, and no thorough population studies have been conducted on any of the species. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Very little is known about the trade in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Brachypelma  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> tarantulas and most specimens are probably coming out of Mexico without proper documentation. Mexico prevents the hunting and export of tarantulas without a permit. At the Fifth Meeting of the Conference of the Parties (Buenos Aires, 1985), the United States proposed the inclusion of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Brachypelma smithi  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (the red-kneed tarantula) in Appendix II because of widespread documented trade. The listing of all  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Brachypelma  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> tarantulas would eliminate the present confusion over identification of which species are entering trade. Most species within the genus are easily recognized by the red or reddish hairs on the legs or abdomen. The Service is, therefore, considering the listing of all members of the genus  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Brachypelma  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> in Appendix II and seeks information on the effects of trade on these tarantulas, especially any data on the volume of specimens entering trade. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 12. Port-Orford-Cedar (Chamaecyparis lawsoniana) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In response to the July 15, 1993, notice (58 FR 38112) which initiated listing preparation for COP9, the Oregon Natural Resources Council provided a thorough draft proposal to include the Lawson-cypress or Port-Orford-cedar ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Chamaecyparis lawsoniana <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) in Appendix II. This species is native to southwestern Oregon and northwestern California within a general coastal area of less than 200 by 100 miles, mostly from about Coos Bay, Oregon south to Arcata, California. It is also in cultivation (and has a number of horticultural varieties). The species has been reduced both in range and by over 85 percent in natural standing volume, and is now logged almost entirely for export (primarily to Japan). An introduced pathogen ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Phytophthora lateralis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) has been spreading particularly along waterways and as a side effect of soil transport by vehicles and logging equipment. The main stimulus for the logging of Port-Orford cedar is high export prices, and one important stimulus for the construction of many logging roads is the export of raw logs. This fungus has spread through the northern and western portions of the tree species' range, and it has infected perhaps 20 percent of the remaining coastal stands. The root disease is virulent, and the infected trees cannot be cured. By the mid-1980s, an estimated 60 percent of the trees of this species in southwestern Oregon's young-growth forests had been killed by this introduced disease. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service is considering submission of a proposal to list the U.S. population of this species and its logs, sawn wood, and veneer in Appendix II. Information is desired particularly on populations that are functioning naturally and are effectively safe from habitat loss, exploitation, and infection; and in addition, information is requested on the location of U.S. non-natural silvicultural plantations and the extent of such exports from them. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

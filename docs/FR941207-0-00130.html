			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 69. We also agree with petitioners and commenters that greater flexibility should be afforded to any applicant whose ownership structures were established before our designated entity requirements were formulated. Therefore, as a further modification, if the sole control group member of an applicant is a business that was in existence and had earnings from operations for at least two years prior to December 31, 1994, we offer the option that control group principals establishing the applicant's status as a minority and/or women-owned business, small or entrepreneurial business may hold 10 percent of the applicant's equity if the 25 percent equity option is used, or a 20 percent equity interest if the 50.1 percent equity option is used. <FOOTCITE>37</FOOTCITE>  The balance of the control group's equity contribution ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  15 or 30.1 percent) must be held in the form of shares or stock options by any of the following: (1) Qualifying principals in the control group; (2) individuals who are members of the applicant's management team (which could include ``nonqualifying'' individuals); or (3) existing investors of business in the control group that were operating and earning revenues for two years prior to December 31, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 37 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> This equity may be held outright or in the form of options provided these options are exercisable at any time, solely at the holder's discretion, and at an exercise price equal to or less than the current market valuation of the underlying shares at the time of the filing of the short-form application. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 70. The lower equity requirement of 10 percent for preexisting companies that are sole control group members addresses the concerns of these firms, many of which have already undergone successive rounds of financing that may have diluted the qualifying investors' original equity interest in the business. Existing firms that were structured prior to the adoption of the entrepreneurs' blocks regulatory scheme are less likely to become ``fronts'' for business that would not qualify for the entrepreneurs' block or the special provisions accorded designated entities. This option is solely intended to accommodate long-standing capital structures of applicants that have already been required to dilute equity ownership to raise capital. Thus, we will require that the portion of equity not held by qualifying principals (15 or 30.1 percent, as the case may be) to be comprised entirely of existing investors of the company (unless the equity is held by management or qualified principals of the control group). As we stated above, we recognize that for many companies, especially those that are publicly-traded, the identities of noncontrolling investors change regularly. Thus we will not place limits on the amount of time a particular individual or entity must have been an investor in the company. We emphasize, however, that we will scrutinize carefully applicants that engage in significant equity reshuffling after adoption of our rules. <FOOTCITE>38</FOOTCITE>  By giving preexisting applicants additional flexibility, we do not intend to place other applicants at a competitive disadvantage by permitting greater capital infusion from institutional investors. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 38 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> We will presume that a change in equity by an investor (in a preexisting business) of five percent or less is not significant, and the burden is on the applicant to demonstrate whether equity changes above five percent are not significant. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 71. In implementing our requirements, we will provide that where the interests in question are not held directly in the applicant, a multiplier will be used to calculate the effective interests held by the control group principals toward fulfillment of the minimum equity requirement. In addition, we will use a multiplier to calculate the interests of noncontrolling investors in the control group so as to assess compliance with the 25 percent nonattributable equity limit. <FOOTCITE>39</FOOTCITE>  A multiplier is a traditional tool used by the Commission to calculate the effective ownership levels of investors that, through one or more intervening corporations, hold indirect interests in a licensee. <FOOTCITE>40</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 39 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> We illustrate the application of a multiplier as follows: If a member of a minority group or a woman holds a 25 percent equity interest in a corporate member of the control group and that corporation holds a 25 percent equity interest in the applicant, the effective interest for purposes of assessing compliance with the minimum equity requirement would be 6.25 percent ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> i.e., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 0.25 &times; 0.25 = 6.25). This falls well below the 25 percent requirement of our original rule. Correspondingly, if a noncontrolling (and nonqualifying) investor holds a 40 percent interest in a corporate member of a control group and that corporation holds 25 percent of the applicant's total equity, the effective interest held in the applicant by the investor would be 10 percent ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> i.e.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 0.25 &times; .40 = 10.00). If that same investor also owns more than 15 percent of the applicant's equity outside of the control group, it would exceed the 25 percent non-attributable equity limit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 40 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See, e.g.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 47 CFR 73.3555 Note 2(d) (indicating that attribution ownership interests in a broadcast licensee, cable television system or daily newspaper that are held indirectly by a party through one or more intervening corporations will be determined by successive multiplication of the ownership percentages for each link in the vertical ownership chain). We note that the multiplier used here does not employ the 51 percent control exception used in the broadcast context since we are using a multiplier only to determine a control group member's equity investment, not whether such member has control or substantial influence over the applicant. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 72. Additionally, in a written  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ex parte  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> presentation, Metricom requests that we exempt small, publicly-traded corporations with widely dispersed voting stock ownership from our control group requirement. Metricom contends that the control group concept is unworkable for small, publicly-traded companies, because it would not be possible to identify a group of shareholders that own 50.1 percent of the corporation's voting stock. As a result, such corporations could be unable to establish eligibility for the entrepreneurs' blocks, or status as a small business. Metricom proposes a test for identifying small, publicly-traded corporations with widely-dispersed voting stock ownership that closely follows guidelines used by the Securities and Exchange Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

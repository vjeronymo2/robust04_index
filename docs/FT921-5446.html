			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / International Company News: Salomon management changes continue CHANGES at the top of Wall Street securities house Salomon Brothers continued yesterday when Mr Robert Salomon replaced Mr Michael Holland as head of the asset management division. Mr Holland left Salomon on Monday to become a vice-chairman at Oppenheimer, the fund management group. Although the departure of Mr Holland was not directly related to fall-out from the bond trading scandal which engulfed Salomon last year and which led to a massive shake-up of the company's senior management, it is the latest in a series of top defections. Last week, Mr Denis Bovins, a key executive in Salomon's investment banking department, left to join rival Wall Street firm Bear Stearns. Mr Salomon, who is a direct descendant of the family that founded Salomon Brothers and who has been at the firm for 16 years, will take over the asset management unit at a time when demand from institutions and wealthy individuals for professional management of their money is booming. Salomon Brothers Asset Management is only three years old, but in that time it has amassed more than Dollars 8.6bn in advisory assets, plus an additional Dollars 7bn in assets held by the Resolution Trust Corporation, the government agency overseeing the bail-out of the collapsed thrift industry. Although the asset management division is still a small contributor to Salomon's total earnings - bond trading and sales remain the mainstay of the firm - it will play an increasingly important role in the future. In common with many other big Wall Street firms, Salomon is expected to build up the parts of the company that provide a regular stream of fee-based revenues as insurance against the volatility of its earnings from traditional securities business.</p>

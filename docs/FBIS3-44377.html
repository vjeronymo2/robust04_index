Many special courts were set up to handle such cases, said  Gao Changli, vice-president of the Supreme People's Court, at  the national conference of presidents of higher people's court,  which ended here today.    "The courts protect the legal rights of all parties  involved,  without discrimination against any side, helping create a better  legal environment for China's opening up to the world," said Gao.    With more investments coming to China's mainland, and the  development of foreign trade and economic co-operation, the  economic cases concerning outside companies have been surging in  China's border and coastal regions, Gao noted.    He said the number of such economic and maritime cases in  1993 increased by 36.6 percent and 41.33 percent, respectively  over the year before.    President of the Higher Court of Shanghai Hu Ruibang said  that the Shanghai courts have been exercising independent  judicial power in economic cases concerning foreign companies,  in accordance to China's laws and the international conventions  China is a party to, and in line with the norms of international  conduct.    In handling cases concerning companies from Taiwan, Hong  Kong  and Macao, Chinese laws and policies are adhered to, he said.    The overriding principle for the courts is to protect  equally  the legal rights of all parties, Hu said.    The Shanghai courts also make efforts to make Chinese laws  known to the foreign business people, the judge said.    He offered an example: A Swedish company decided to withdraw  its business from Shanghai after it was sued by a Chinese  company, because of suspicion it would be discriminated against  by a Chinese court.    However, Hu said, after the mediation of a Shanghai court,  the two companies reached an agreement.    The Swedish company's confidence was boosted and it decided  to invest further in Shanghai, Hu said.    President of the Shenzhen Intermediate Court Wang Changying  said a special court, the second economic court, has been  established to handle cases concerning foreign companies or  companies from Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao. It is the first of  its kind in China, he noted.    He explained that this is part of the judiciary's efforts to  safeguard and promote the reform and opening up of China's  leading special economic zone.    The court has so far handled 700 cases, with 900 million  yuan  (about 112 million U.S. dollars) involved, he said.</p>

			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / Finance and the Family: Endowment fund launch A FUND which will invest in second-hand with profits endowment policies has been launched by BZW. The structure of the fund, which will be based in Jersey but listed on the London stock exchange, is designed to help investors with their financial planning for items such as school fees. The BZW endowment fund will have a 12-year life, but will distribute its assets to investors over the last five years of its life, during 2001-2005. These payments will be taxed as capital, not income and could be an advantage to those who do not use their annual CGT allowance (Pounds 5,800 in 1993-94). Such an arrangement would not be possible for an investment trust. The fund will buy second-hand endowments from market makers Beale Dobie and Policy Portfolio at a discounted rate. Although bonuses on such policies are expected to be cut again, BZW believes the fund can return 10.1 per cent per year to investors. This expectation is based on the assumption of a one-off 10 per cent cut in bonuses and no growth in bonus rates thereafter. BZW is attempting to raise Pounds 20m by offering shares at 100p each. The shares will be payable in two instalments of 50p, with the second instalment due in April 1994. The partly paid structure will help the fund time its purchases of second-hand endowment policies in what is a relatively illiquid market. Income-seeking investors should note that the fund will pay no dividends. The annual management charge will be 0.5 per cent and the costs of issue around 5.5 per cent.</p>

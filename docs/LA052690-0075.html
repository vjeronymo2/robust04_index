			<p><P> May 26, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> LOUISIANA;  </P> <P> FUEL SPILLED INTO MISSISSIPPI RIVER  </P> <P> A freighter collided with a brace of barges on the Mississippi River near the  New Orleans French Quarter.  </P> <P> The accident tore the ship open and it dumped 60,000 gallons of fuel oil that  formed a slick 60 miles downstream. Workers were transferring the ship's  remaining fuel to other tanks and shifting cargo and ballast to keep the damage  above the water line. A number of communities including New Orleans draw their  drinking water from the river. But the accident happened below the New Orleans  intakes and only threatened one intake: for the town of Pointe a La Hache,  officials said.  </P></p>

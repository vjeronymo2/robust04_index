			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Shigeru Komago] </F>   [Text] Washington, 7 Mar -- It was learned on the morning  of 7 March that Motorola Inc. of the United States made a new  proposal on the opening of the Japanese mobile and car phone  market. The new proposal demands that Japan increase  Motorola-formula mobile and car phones by about 240,000 in a  year in service areas between Tokyo and Nagoya. Japan considers  the proposal a demand for setting a numerical target, thus it  is opposed to it. Because of this, negotiations between Japan  and the United States over opening Japan's cellular phone market  may become rough at the final stage. Nevertheless, because the  proposal is not an official one put forward by the U.S. Trade  Representative Office, Tokyo thinks that "we will eventually be  able to persuade the United States to withdraw the proposal."</p>

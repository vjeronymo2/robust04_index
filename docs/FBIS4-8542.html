			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Zeljko Kruselj: "Tudjman's Message to the </F> `Elimination Candidates'"]    [Text] Admittedly, the commentators who have been trying  to justify Tudjman's "elimination" of Josip Manolic [president  of the Chamber of Counties] in every possible way are not having  an easy time. One of them has, thus -- perhaps to make this  reckoning seem a "historical inevitability" -- compared Manolic  to "Macek in 1941, when the creator of the Bannat of Croatia  established that the antifascist coalition would win the war."  He said that the estimate was good, but Macek did not benefit  too much from it in 1945. Manolic would have fared the same way  at present with his story about the "integral  Bosnia-Herzegovina" if President Tudjman had not helped the  Croats there in their defense against Serb aggression.    If we neglect the fact that it was Tudjman, rather than his  opponent, who was obsessed with the idea of the Bannat, which is  one of the reasons that the Croat-Muslim conflicts escalated,  the basic question remains: Who does Croatian President Franjo  Tudjman represent in this analogy? There is only one logical,  but also historically acceptable, answer: Josip Broz. More  precisely, he became so only after the Washington agreement,  while at the beginning of the Bosnia-Herzegovina plot he seemed  more like a "poglavnik" [reference to Ante Pavelic -- wartime  Croatian leader], convinced that the Muslims must accept the  Croat-Serb squaring of accounts regarding "the most complicated  country in the world."  <H5>  Who Is "Rankovic" and Who Is "Tito"? </H5>   However, if Tudjman is Tito in this analogy, who has after  all always fascinated him with his style of ruling, then Manolic  can only be the personification of the protagonists of the  Croatian spring, Savka [Dabcevic-Kucar, president of the  Croatian National Party] and Miko [Tripalo], his parliament  colleague. Namely, Tito overthrew the Croatian leaders after  they had correctly identified the "carcinoma" of the Yugoslav  federation of the time. The Croatian "pair of oars" had to fall;  although Tripalo had been "predestined" to be Tito's successor,  a radical constitutional reform, as they conceived it, could not  be avoided. A similar thing has been happening with the  reestablishment of Manolic's view of Croatian policy toward  Bosnia, as well as the problems of the internal strengthening of  the legal state.    This is why the claims, formed by the "right" faction in the  party in power, about Tudjman in fact removing "the Croatian  Rankovic", are somewhat tragicomical. Namely, Manolic's  political trouble started the moment he started to support the  democratization of Croatia -- too loudly and on the recognizable  antifascist basis -- rather than its transformation into a  police state. The problem was also that the former "number-two  man" had, during his "Udba" [Yugoslav State Security Service]  career, when he did not bother Tudjman at all, created too wide  a circle of political enemies for himself, mostly in the top  state circles. Eventually the "anti-Manolic coalition" became  so numerous and influential that it was much easier for the  Croatian president to say goodbye to his old friend than to  directly oppose those whose politics have been seriously shaken  by the Washington change.    The worst thing for Manolic in all this was that, until the  last moment, he could not believe that the rule of unquestioning  obedience also held true for Tudjman's closest associates, and  even for those who made his breakthrough to power possible,  which his opponents had been making good tactical use of all the  while. They will verbally support the Croatian president as  long as he keeps them in their present positions, that is, until  they raise the issue of his responsibility for joint mistakes.    Be that as it may, the key question at the moment is how the  departure of the leader of the "left" within the ruling party  [Croatian democratic Community -- HDZ] will be reflected on the  Croatian political scene. The answer cannot be unambiguous, but  Manolic's departure will surely incite new political regrouping  as well as a clearer profiling of the HDZ from a movement into a  party of the proclaimed Christian democratic orientation. This  aim ensues from the conclusions of the Second General HDZ  Congress, when the intraparty conflict was temporarily  "conserved," but in the new circumstances there is no reason not  to start implementing it.    Naturally, the precondition for this is Tudjman  reestablishing the balance of his "left" and "right" factions --  concealed behind whose ideologized names there are, in fact,  radically opposed views on the democratization of state power --  or getting rid of all their leaders as soon as possible. More  precisely, it is a public secret that "Susak's faction" will now  try to remove Stipe Mesic, with whom it "waged a war" in a more  open way than with Manolic until the Second General Congress.  If Mesic falls, the fate of the other "Manolic followers" who  hold important positions within the parliament is also sealed --  primarily Degoricija and Boljkovac -- after which the purge of  the "technomanagerial" faction will follow, ranging from Franjo  Greguric to the present Prime Minister Nikica Valentic.  <H5>  Valentic's Threat "Frozen" </H5>   The "lobbyist" information on Valentic's recent threat to  resign, which would have disastrous consequences on the final  success of the economic reform, speaks of how important  Manolic's departure is in this disturbance of relations.  Tudjman has temporarily "frozen" this threat by promising some  -- still insufficiently known -- personnel "abortions," but it  is clear who it is in the party in power who bothers Valentic  the most in implementing the further stage of restructuring the  Croatian economy.    If Tudjman opts for the policy of balance, it is inevitable  that he will not only have to prevent more departures of "soft"  HDZ members, but also to listen to Manolic's swan song and get  rid of Defense Minister Gojko Susak, for whom it is not  difficult to find something "incriminating" regarding the events  in Bosnia-Herzegovina. In these complex combinations, Vladimir  Seks, the government person most responsible for the poor  functioning of the legal system, is in the same danger as lower  parliamentary officials such as Ivan Milas and Luka Bebic. The  claim of the "right" that it had already bled because of Vice  Vukojevic's departure from the information service of the  Ministry of Foreign Affairs will not satisfy the opposite side,  because his intraparty influence has not decreased  significantly. Involving the "retired" Mate Boban in this story  would be even more absurd, considering the fact that he is a  politician from a neighboring country.    If the current international situation is taken into  account,  which, after the Croat-Muslim agreement, is much more favorable  than in the period when the conflict between the HDZ factions  culminated, it is certain that Tudjman will keep an eye on the  intraparty balance, but in the way that he will gradually get  rid of both the "left" and "right" factions. The most important  thing in these politics, which could most easily be described  with the proverb regarding drinking half and giving the other  half to the horse, is perhaps the fact that a start was made by  eliminating Tudjman's best known friend and fellow fighter, so  that the other "elimination candidates" could be informed that  their political future will cause even fewer dilemmas.  Naturally, political wit will not allow Tudjman to make such  replacements in a "package," considering the fact that, in such  circumstances, there is a danger of a mass escape of members to  competitive parties. The "certificates of withdrawal" will  arrive individually, equally on both sides, and after each the  pulse of the electoral body will be felt with great care.    Tudjman has the whole of two years to "renovate" the party  in  power, which is how far ahead the following parliamentary  elections are, so it is to be supposed that the written-off  officials, including Manolic, will not be capable of causing a  serious parliamentary crisis or a paralysis of the political  system, let alone of threatening a coup. Of the protagonists in  the current intraparty conflicts, the only faction spared will  be the above mentioned "technomanagerial" one, which Tudjman  needs to shape a modern market economy. On the other hand, all  the important instruments of power will be held by the  representatives of the Christian Democratic faction, primarily  Jure Radic and Mate Granic, who will, at the lower level, rely  on the "subsequent" HDZ members not burdened by the present  ideological conflicts. The only winner in that period will, all  in all, be President Tudjman, so that at the next elections  there could be a test of how interesting the party, redesigned  in terms of personnel and program, is to potential voters.    During this two-year HDZ "cleaning up," the chances of  Manolic and those who will soon follow him making a political  career are slim. If Manolic's positions are analyzed, it is  evident that they are already contained in the programs of some  Croatian parties, primarily in the Liberal and Social Democratic  parties, so that, in the case of a new party being founded, he  could not expect too many members joining. It would be more  realistic for the future "renegades" to join related parties,  unless the leaderships of the latter establish that the HDZ  "early guerrilla fighters" are too great a weight around their  necks.  <H5>  No One Needs Losers </H5>   As far as Manolic is concerned, he immediately felt what it  meant to be a political "renegade." After he sought the support  of the parliamentary parties and the general public for the  replacement of his opponent Gojko Susak, the leadership of the  main opposition party spoke up, but in defense of the defense  minister. Namely, Liberal leaders Drazen Budisa and Damir Zoric  estimated that it was a good opportunity for improving their  relations with the Herzegovinian lobby, as they intended to  cover the Bosnia- Herzegovina areas too. Manolic was thus  tricked here too, and Tudjman had no more reason to hesitate.  The later support of the Liberals in preventing Manolic's  abdication at the Chamber of Counties bears no special  significance, because it is known in advance how the HDZ  "machine" will vote next time. Evidently, no one needs  political losers, even when the events confirm their premature  "cock's crow."</p>

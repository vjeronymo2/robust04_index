			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Survey of Hungary (6): Reserves of strength - The external accounts are in good shape THE clearest indicator of Hungary's readiness to embark on a new path of sustained economic growth is to be found in the strength of its foreign reserves and the reduced burden of debt. Over the past two years Hungary, once viewed as the most indebted of the post-communist states on a per capita basis, has built up its reserves from Dollars 1.2bn in 1990 to nearly Dollars 6bn. Gross debt has stabilised at just under Dollars 23bn while the combination of a Dollars 700m current surplus over the first seven months, and the continuing strong inflow of foreign investment funds, has allowed a Dollars 1.1bn reduction in net foreign debt to around Dollars 15bn, according to Mr Peter Bod, governor of the newly independent central bank, the Hungarian National Bank. As a result Hungary's gross debt service ratio has dropped from 63 per cent in 1990 to around 38 per cent this year. It is forecast to drop to between 31/33 per cent in 1993. This dramatic improvement in the external accounts is partly a reflection of the collapse in rouble-denominated trade with the former Comecon area. Although Hungary still imports most of its diminishing requirements of oil and gas from the former Soviet Union at dollar prices, resources formerly dedicated to rouble area exports are now more efficiently and profitably deployed supplying OECD, and especially EC markets. Hungary also no longer has to pay hard currency for components incorporated into Hungarian goods sold on Comecon markets for roubles. This and the lower real incomes of many poorer Hungarians, has contributed to slack import demand. Over the first seven months of this year exports to the EC rose by 21 per cent compared with a 14 per cent increase in exports overall. In September, according to Mr Bela Kadar, the foreign trade minister, exports to the EC exceeded 50 per cent of the total for the first time. This, he points out, already takes Hungary over the sought after 'integration threshold' which has to be passed if aspirations for full EC membership before the turn of the century, are to be realised. Current levels of exports to the EC compare with the 14 per cent share of Hungary's exports to the Community in the 1970's and a 25 per cent average in the 1980's. Traditionally food exports have been high on the list of exports to EC markets and freer access granted by the EC association agreement signed earlier this year has helped to boost food exports by 10 per cent. But with over 60 per cent of all foreign investment going into the manufacturing and engineering sectors, Hungary looks well placed to increase its penetration of EC industrial markets. Thanks largely to its early start with semi-market reforms in the late 1960's, Hungary already managed to attract Dollars 570m in foreign investment between 1972 and 1989. This experience facilitated its leap to the top of the post-communist foreign investment league in 1990 when it attracted Dollars 900m. The equity inflow into privatisation and greenfield investment projects rose to Dollars 1.56bn in 1991 and amounted to Dollars 740m over the first half of this year. To date over half the total foreign investment in post-communist east and central Europe has flowed into this country. For the average Hungarian, however, the bulging coffers of the National Bank of Hungary are merely a tantalizing reflection of the scale of the sacrifice of living standards demanded for future growth. This is politically unsustainable and skirmishing is already mounting with 1994 elections in view. Export-led growth will remain the underlying priority. But Hungary no longer needs to add to reserves and can afford a more expansive, domestic economic policy. The IMF's requirement that the budget deficit is reduced to within 6 per cent of GDP will ensure that reflating the domestic economy starts cautiously. But industrial output is already perking up after two traumatic years for the old-style public sector economy. Output from the dominant state sector dropped nearly 45 per cent from 1988 levels but hit bottom in May and is now showing tentative signs of recovery. Output from the dynamic, but still largely unrecorded private sector, is rising sharply but its growth is not yet strong enough to absorb unemployment which has soared from one to 11.1 per cent over the past two years. Next year's expected rise in domestic output and consumption will raise imports and probably reduce the strong current account surpluses of the past two years. But reserves and exports are now strong enough to sustain a politically necessary rise in domestic output and income. This year has already seen the first clear benefit from foreign investment. Mr Kadar estimates that around 15 per cent of Hungarian exports over the first half of this year came from newly established foreign companies such as General Electric and Elektrolux and many other smaller companies among the 13,000 foreign joint ventures formed to date. This proportion is expected to rise smartly as export production builds up at the car and engine plants built by General Motors, and the other investments such as Suzuki and Ford. Foreign companies have invested over Dollars 4bn and are playing a crucial role in bringing Hungary's productive capacity up to world standards. But they are also looking forward to rising domestic incomes and demand. Only when this starts rising will the newcomers benefit, as suppliers to the growing domestic market and as exporters from this stable and low cost base.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Aranyaprathet -- Khmer Rouge guerrillas have seized  several outposts of Cambodian government forces in Thmar Puok  district of Banteay Meanchey Province since they launched  attacks on Thursday.    Thai military sources claimed the guerrillas had driven  Phnom  Penh forces out of their outposts in Banteay Chhma, Kok Khieu,  Kauk Mon, Toek Lesor, Phum Totoek and Phum Soeng. The  guerrillas were poised to attack Thmar Puok township, the  sources said.    Retreating elements of the Phnom Penh's 3rd and 7th  divisions  are regrouping and are waiting for reinforcements from Banteay  Meanchey.    The outbreak of fighting had caused 5,000 Cambodian  civilians  to pack up in preparation to flee across the border to  Thailand's Ta Phraya district if the fighting intensified, the  sources said.</p>

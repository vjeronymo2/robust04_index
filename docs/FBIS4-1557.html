			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 30 (XINHUA) -- A series of major  economic reform measures are expected to greatly boost the  development of China's fledgling markets, economists said here  today.    Wang Kuicai, economist of the Internal Trade Ministry, said  in an interview with XINHUA that China's total retail sale  volume of commodities will continue to increase by a big margin  this year, adding that 1994 will be another year of fast growth  for China's economy.    The stable economic growth will ensure ample supplies of  various commodities and the actual demand for commodities will  remain robust this year, according to the economist.    According to official estimates, the country's total  investment in fixed assets this year will be up 20 percent over  the 1993 figure.    Moreover, the reform of the wage system and particularly the  measures taken by the government to support the agricultural  sector will help raise the per capita income by 26 percent for  urban residents and by nine percent for farmers.    The economist expects that in 1994 the total retail sale  volume of commodities will jump by around 23 to 24 percent to  hit 1,650 billion yuan to 1,680 billion yuan.    The present situation of supply exceeding demand will remain  unchanged this year, though the supply of some agricultural and  sideline products may fall short of demand.    The State Ministry of Internal Trade made a comprehensive  analysis of the supply and demand of the country's 726 major  commodities recently. The results showed that 95.8 percent of  the 542 major industrial products have struck a balance between  supply and demand or supply exceeding demand; and 62.5 percent  of the agricultural and sideline products are also in that state.    However, edible oil and cotton will fall short of demand,  the  economist said.    According to the experts, price rises and insufficient  supply  of some agricultural and sideline products will constitute the  major potential factors fluctuating Chinese domestic markets.    Therefore, the experts stressed that all the government  departments involved must see to a stable growth of domestic  markets and try their best to maintain overall balance between  supply and demand.    They called on various localities to straighten out in good  time the structural contradictions and regional imbalances, by  means of macro economic control and market regulation, so as to  ensure a prosperous and stable market.    Ying Wenhua, another economist of the Internal Trade  Ministry  predicted that the markets for capital goods, particularly the  sale of steel products, will be brisk in the first half of 1994,  which he believed would in turn invigorate the whole market.</p>

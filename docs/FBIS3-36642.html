			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sergey Knyazkov under the "Postscriptum: Events </F> and Commentaries" rubric: "One Step Forward, Two Steps Back.  The Results of the 16th Round of Russian-Estonian Talks Are  Very Modest, If Not...."]    [Text] Talks between Russian and Estonian state  delegations were held in the Moscow region 1-2 February. As  Vasiliy Svirin, head of the Russian delegation, stressed, the  Russian delegation went to the talks with the intention of  working for tangible progress but these hopes were only partly  realized. The fruitful first day of the talks was completely  nullified by the deadlock on day two.    Vasiliy Svirin noted that significant progress was achieved  in the preparation of the main treaty on the withdrawal of the  Russian troops from Estonia and the terms of their temporary  presence on the republic's territory. There is every reason to  believe that it will be initialed by the two states' delegations  in the near future.    The agreement on the social protection of Russian military  pensioners and members of their families was examined in  conjunction with the treaty on the troop withdrawal. It was a  cause of great disappointment that the Estonian delegation  adopted a tough and intransigent stance here which made it  impossible to achieve even minor positive results. Estonia is  demanding that military pensioners who retired after 20 December  1991 leave the republic, regardless of whether they have  apartments or not. Taken together with members of their  families, that amounts to 44,000 people. Those who were  discharged earlier have the right only to apply for a residence  permit [vid na zhitelstvo]. However, according to the Estonian  Republic Government's decree dated 1 December 1992, this  application must be accompanied by the fulfillment of a number  of demeaning requirements.    The lack of an accord on the Agreement on the Social  Protection of Military Pensioners was the reason for the refusal  to transfer to the Estonian side the timetable for the Russian  troop withdrawal which has already been prepared.    The discussion of the problem of citizenship may also be  counted among the failures of the latest round of talks. A long  time ago the Russian delegation prepared a draft treaty which  proposes that Russians living in Estonia and Estonians living in  Russia be afforded the opportunity to acquire Russian or  Estonian citizenship. But the Estonian delegation again avoided  concrete work on this document.    The Russian and Estonian delegations also discussed a broad  range of border questions. The Estonian delegation blocked all  discussion of the question of the land border and is refusing  proposals on its demarcation. This is due to the fact that  Estonia is continuing its attempts to make territorial claims on  Russia. In the words of the Russian diplomat, these claims are  futile. Furthermore, Vasiliy Svirin added, if Estonia does not  react in the future to proposals to carry out the demarcation of  the border Russia will be forced to do that unilaterally.</p>

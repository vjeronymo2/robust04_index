			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / BPB profits rise 87% after price war ends Pre-tax profits of BPB Industries, Europe's biggest plasterboard manufacturer, rose 87 per cent to Pounds 107.7m during the year to March as the company continued to recover following the end of a 'destructive price war'. The profits increase announced yesterday was higher than expected and BPB's shares rose 4 1/2 per cent to 302p. The price war, which concluded in 1992, was waged between the UK group, which controls about 50 per cent of the west European market, and Lafarge Coppee of France and Knauf of Germany, which split the remainder roughly equally. BPB said the price of plasterboard in Germany, France and the UK had risen on average by about a quarter since March 1992 but was still about 25 per cent lower than at the beginning of 1990. A 27 per cent fall in manufacturing costs since 1990, however, meant that prices did not need to reach previous peaks for margins to recover. Margins on plasterboard and plaster sales last year improved from 8.6 per cent to 12.3 per cent, while sales volume increased by just 4.5 per cent. Mr Alan Turner, chairman, said that prices might rise by 2 or 3 per cent this year, but future growth was more likely to be generated by increased sales rather than price rises. He said the three manufacturers had finally seen commonsense and ended a price war estimated to have cost the industry Pounds 200m in lost revenue since 1989. Prospects now looked bright with European construction activity forecast to recover over the next two years, led by housebuilding and sharp growth in eastern Germany where BPB plans to build a large new plant in Berlin costing almost Pounds 50m. The company also predicted that European sales would rise as plasterboard continued to increase its market share against other products. BPB's advance in pre-tax profits was achieved in spite of a Pounds 3.9m increase in redundancy and reorganisation costs to Pounds 15.2m. Turnover grew 2.3 per cent from Pounds 1.12bn to Pounds 1.15bn. Earnings per share rose by 85 per cent to 15p (8.1p), and a final dividend of 5.3p (4.8p) makes a total of 8.1p for the year, up 8 per cent on the previous year's 7.5p. All of the company's main building materials businesses, other than plaster in Spain and Italy, recorded strong profits growth, while Canada had moved from break-even to profit. Lower costs, better prices and higher sales volume had prompted a net cash inflow of Pounds 95m, helped by a low tax payment of Pounds 2m, a reduced interest charge of Pounds 18m (Pounds 29.6m) and 'a minimal acquisition spend'. Net borrowings fell by Pounds 104.2m to Pounds 138.2m, reducing gearing from 35 per cent to 19 per cent. Lex, Page 20</p>

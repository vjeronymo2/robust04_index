			<p>930816 FT  16 AUG 93 / Electricity price cuts likely for large companies SOME of Britain's largest companies should see reductions in record high electricity costs this autumn after a decision by the power industry to change the way prices are calculated. The changes are likely to lead to falls in prices of the electricity wholesale 'pool', where power in England and Wales is traded, of between at least 1.5 per cent and 3 per cent. The move could save some companies several millions of pounds annually. Imperial Chemical Industries' annual bill, for example, is more than Pounds 140m. There has been strong criticism and intense scrutiny of the industry after a 20 per cent rise in pool prices since April. The government and Prof Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, have been under pressure from large companies to act on prices or persuade electricity companies to do so. Further reforms being examined by the pool's executive, made up mainly of electricity company managers, could also lead to reductions. Mrs Margaret Thompson, pool chief executive, said the changes were the first to come out of a long-term review and were a step in the right direction. However, they are unlikely to satisfy intensive energy users who have suffered significant price rises since electricity privatisation three years ago. In the first of two reforms agreed last week, the pool is to introduce a system, called demand side bidding, through which large customers can agree to reduce consumption if the price goes above a certain level. This is expected by the pool to lead to a 3 per cent cut in pool prices at times of peak demand and 1.5 per cent on average. A software system, called goalpost, blamed for sudden fluctuations in the pool price, will be abolished immediately. Price 'spikes', or surges, are particularly prominent early in the morning, causing difficulties for industries which work through the night. Goalpost's abolition has already had an effect. Weekend pool prices, the first since the change was agreed, were considerably less variable than they had been recently. Abolition will have an effect on overall prices, although the pool is unable to say how much. Most electricity consumers, including householders, will be affected by the changes only at the margins. Their power is traded through the pool, but they have been shielded from price changes by 'hedging' contracts between electricity companies. Future contracts will be affected by current pool prices. The pool changes have had a direct effect on an estimated 1,500 industrial customers, including ICI, who buy their power directly from it. Some were looking for a demand side bidding system which introduced more significant rewards for participants. The mechanism adopted by the pool will allow demand bidders to be paid on the same basis as generators which bid into the pool. But companies which agree to cut power demands will be given less of a share in the money created by subsequent pool price cuts than they wanted. Instead this will be divided between all electricity consumers in the form of price cuts. The extent of the cut in pool prices will depend on several factors, including the attitude of the generators whose bids into the pool are the most influential factor. Any change in their bidding behaviour will be watched closely by Prof Littlechild, who is already reviewing their costs and margins.</p>

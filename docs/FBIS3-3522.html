			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondents Ying Zhaoxiang (2019 0340 4382) and Gan </F> Guorong (1626 0948 2837): "Zhejiang's Macroeconomic Regulations  and Control Over Banking Yield Marked Results With an Increase  in Both Saving Deposits and Currency Withdrawal" -- ZHEJIANG  RIBAO headline]    [Text] Thanks to effective macroeconomic regulations and  control, last year Zhejiang has turned around its once tight  financial situation and returned the banking system to normal  operations. Saving deposits in both urban and rural areas  across the province increased by 15.014 billion yuan last year,  an increase of 3.776 billion yuan over 1992, while net currency  withdrawals of 5.755 billion last year represented a 1.068  billion yuan increase over 1992. These improvements have lent a  strong hand to Zhejiang's economic construction.    Over the past year, Zhejiang has taken a series of effective  macroeconomic control measures over the banking sector, singling  out "wanton fund-raising, borrowing, and investment" for  rectification. Through such measures as intensifying propaganda  and guidance, standardizing fund-raising from the public,  tightening supervision and management, and taking action against  illegal fund-raising, branches of the People's Bank of China  throughout the province managed to stabilize credits and sources  of funds. While conscientiously clearing all illegal loans,  various financial organizations in the province succeeded in  recalling 2.1 billion yuan in loans from non-financial  organizations, or 49.8 percent, and 3.57 billion yuan from  non-banking financial organizations, or 57.4 percent. In the  meantime, branches of the People's Bank of China in Zhejiang  conducted inspections and screenings on 149 economic entities  run by the bank itself, resulting by the end of last year in the  withdrawal of all loans extended to them as capital. Twenty-  six of these economic entities were eventually removed, merged  with, or transferred to other enterprises; the remainder have no  more capital, personnel, asset, or financial connections with  the People's Bank of China.    Another effective measure taken by Zhejiang in strengthening  macroeconomic control over the banking system was the blocking  of all illegal means and the opening up of proper channels.  With concentrated efforts to attract savings, banks in Zhejiang  led other provinces in turning around the declining savings  situation in China. As of the end of April, savings deposits  for both urban and rural areas in Zhejiang were still down by  300 million yuan as compared to the beginning of the year, a  decrease of 6 billion yuan as compared to the corresponding  period in 1992. However, things turned around by the end of  last year, registering an increase of 3.776 billion yuan in  savings deposits over the previous year. While appropriately  extending more loans, Zhejiang has adjusted its loan targets so  that funds will be concentrated to meet the requirements of key  projects. New bank loans extended to state-owned industries and  foreign trade last year increased by 13.1 percent and 2.9  percent respectively over the previous year. No "IOU's" were  issued in purchasing farm and sideline products.    While strengthening macroeconomic control over the banking  sector, Zhejiang also accelerated the pace of reform of the  banking structure. Last year saw the incorporation of the  Ningbo International Bank, the first joint venture between  Zhejiang Commercial Bank and a wholly foreign-funded bank. With  the approval of the head office of the People's Bank of China,  two commercial banks--the Zhongxin Realty Bank's Hangzhou Branch  and the Pudong Development Bank's Hangzhou Branch--began the  process of incorporation last year. Simultaneously, a host of  financial organizations were added throughout the  province--including the People's Bank of China's county  branches, Communications Bank office, city credit service, stock  exchange trading division, and housing loan service--which  served to enhance the operating capacity of specialized banks  and functions of international finance. The financial market  has been developing rapidly with the inauguration of the  provincial Stock Registration Center and the provincial Stock  Trading Center, initially forming a financial market system that  brought the three markets--interbank loans market, stocks  market, and foreign exchange regulatory market--into one. The  provincial financing center reported an accumulated transaction  of 17.09 billion yuan last year, a 67.7 increase over the  preceding year, while that of foreign exchange regulation  reached $1.94 billion, a 41.2 percent increase.</p>

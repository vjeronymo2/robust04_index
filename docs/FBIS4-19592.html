			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Relations With Russia"] </F>   [Text] The official visit that Russian President Boris  Yeltsin paid to Spain this week has laid the foundations of what  could be the normalization of relations between the two  countries. The treaty of friendship and cooperation signed  Tuesday [12 April] is valid for 10 years and envisages annual  contacts between the top Spanish leaders [as published], two  meetings between the foreign ministers, and interparliamentary  contacts.    Relations between Spain and Russia have historically been  like the River Guadiana: nonexistent, meager, or anomalous --  hardly ever normal. The exquisitely diplomatic way in which  Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez presented the now signed  friendship and cooperation treaty is proof of this. For the  Spanish leader, the treaty is the continuation of another signed  by Spain and Russia in 1812 -- the year of Napoleon's defeat; a  formula which, among other things, enabled him to to avoid any  reference to Mikhail Gorbachev -- the Soviet Union's last  president -- with whom he signed another document of a similar  nature.    So henceforth relations between the two countries have an  appropriate framework for ceasing to be "meager," as the Spanish  side described them, or "anomalous" -- the term used by Yeltsin  to refer to the past. To the treaty of friendship and  cooperation there must be added the signing of another five  agreements aimed at promoting trade between the two countries,  but this normalization of bilateral relations, although  important for Spain, also has a Russian and a European  interpretation.    Less than three years after Yeltsin replaced Gorbachev, the  Russian political situation, and, by extension, that of the  countries comprising the CIS -- essentially, the geographical  area of the former Soviet Union -- remains unstable. Yeltsin  has again received the Spanish leaders' support for his reform  policy, but the difficult internal situation continues to cast  dark clouds over the transition to democracy and the  liberalization of the economy. That is why Yeltsin's constant  allusions to the Spanish democratic transition should not be  seen as purely rhetorical. The cases are different, among other  things because in Russia the change of political system must be  accompanied by a radical change in the economic system, but the  path toward Russia's modernization could be similar -- through a  pact -- as Yeltsin strove to emphasize during his visit.    The enterprise of ensuring that Russia's transformation is  peaceful is an enterprise for all Europeans -- not just the  Russians -- and the best way to ensure that this is so is  through cooperation, from which Spain could also benefit in  normalizing its relations with a giant which, while it is now  experiencing a grave crisis, has extraordinary potential. Hence  the treaty of friendship and cooperation signed in Madrid places  Spain in a good position with respect to the future. On one  occasion, when asked where Russia was on the map, Hungarian  President Arpad Goncz stated that Russia is neither Europe nor  Asia -- simply Russia. This is certainly so, but agreements  such as those signed in Madrid can enable Russia not to move  away from Europe.</p>

			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / Arts: Oddities in demand - In a difficult year for the salerooms - as stock markets plummeted just before important auctions took place - Antony Thorncroft senses some optimism in the air So it is steady as she goes. This week the leading auction houses totted up their takings for the season and cheered themselves up - just. Sales at Sotheby's were 19 per cent higher at Pounds 919m, while Christie's managed a 14 per cent lift to Pounds 781m. In dollar terms the results were not quite so impressive (rises of 15 per cent and 11 per cent respectively), and these days the big salerooms think in dollars. But they are entitled to put the best gloss possible on what has been a mildly encouraging year. As Sotheby's president DeDe Brooks says 'The best we could hope for was a good strong climb back. If we could grow by this rate every year we would be ecstatic. We've had some wonderful goods last season but prices have not moved much'. Sales might still be less than half the level achieved in the annus mirabilis of 1989-90 (when will Sotheby's match the Dollars 3.2b it recorded then?) but at least the worst is definitely over. A year ago the auction houses expected trade to pick up faster than it has, but they were basically very unlucky over the timing of their biggest auctions of the season, the important Impressionist and Modern picture sales in New York and London in May and June. The autumn sales in the sector had been encouraging, with Sotheby's recording what turned out to be the highest price paid during the season of Dollars 13.75m (Pounds 9.34m) for one of Matisse's experimental cut outs. Their success lured on to the market some good - as well as some flashy and well hawked - pictures, which Sotheby's and Christie's fought over with all the cut-throat intensity that characterised the hyped up market of the late 1980s. To secure works by Monet, Gauguin, Sisley and Cezanne Christie's in New York gave the heirs of the late Neil McConnell a non-refundable advance in the region of Dollars 11m. Unfortunately the stock markets in New York and London went into free fall just before both sets of auctions. The super rich caught fright and decided they could live without art. Christie's received the coldest blast and its sales were very disappointing. It failed to recoup its gamble on the McConnell pictures and presumably still has an unsold Cezanne in its strong room. Sotheby's managed to get away its two major works in London, paintings by Manet and Monet, for Pounds 4.4m and Pounds 4.8m, and could claim a success. But this is still a weak market. In the late 1980s the auction houses raced ahead by selling Impressionist and modern art at ever rising prices (to a peak of Dollars 82.5m for a Van Gogh), usually to the Japanese. This sector accounted for over half their turnover. It now contributes nearer a quarter, and there are some doubts as to whether Impressionist paintings will return to the levels of 1989-90 for a decade. Fortunately there will always be people who buy art because they love it, and they have become more active again in the past year. The prices that sellers were prepared to accept (or that were forced on them by auction houses desperate to boost sales) came into balance with the selective purses of potential buyers. The feature of the season was the brisk trade in low and medium priced antiques. After all, the economy is improving; there is a great deal of money around in the City and elsewhere; and there is little attraction in storing it away at low interest rates. Lloyds is still not a major factor in bringing goods on to the market, although Phillips was helped by a spate of house sales when families sold up to meet tax demands. Such auctions invariably exceed their estimates and they helped raise Phillips turnover by 12.5 per cent in 1993-94 to Pounds 88m. But the real star among the medium-sized auction houses was Christie's South Kensington which added 28 per cent to its turnover, weighing in with an impressive Pounds 50m. There were its usual idiosyncratic records - Pounds 39,600 for a camera (although it was gold plated); Pounds 203,500 for a car number plate, K1 NGS; and Pounds 22,100 for a Walt Disney poster. Competition is becoming intense in this sector. This week Bonhams, which had another excellent year with a 21 per cent jump in sales to almost Pounds 34m, raised its charge to buyers from 10 to 15 per cent of the hammer price, the same level as Sotheby's and Christie's. It has been forced to do so because its rivals are involved in a price war when pitching to sellers, cutting their charges from the traditional 10 per cent premium in their keenness to secure goods for sale. Bonhams was losing out and reckons it must be more flexible in its terms for sellers if it is to continue to grow. Along with the malaise in post-1870 art (and to a lesser extent among Old Masters which have become a tricky market, despite the remarkable Pounds 4.2m paid at Sotheby's for a landscape by the Dutch 17th century artist Aelbert Cuyp), and the improving demand below the Pounds 10,000 a lot level, there were three other noteworthy features to the season - the strong demand for furniture; the premium carried by anything odd and exceptional; and the growing importance of South East Asia to the future of the art market. Unlike pictures, furniture is essential to life, so why not buy antique examples which can be cheaper than contemporary and have a tradition of holding, or increasing, in value? This message has got home, not least among recipients of City bonuses. Christie's furniture sales were up 44 per cent last season, with record prices set for pieces designed by Chippendale and Charles Rennie Mackintosh. If recent buyers of post-1870 art are licking their wounds there always seems to be bidders for unusual masterpieces. The most surprising price of the season was the Pounds 7.7m paid at Christie's for part of an Assyrian relief of the 7th century BC which had lain ignored for decades at Canford School. Equally bizarre was the Pounds 441,500 paid for a 12th century carved 'unicorn' horn. Less surprising perhaps was the record Pounds 2.4m which secured a bronze lion from Moorish Spain, a record for any Islamic work of art. Sotheby's secured a record of Pounds 188,500 for a 20th century doll and Pounds 276,000 for a Purcell manuscript. Christie's, and to a lesser extent, Sotheby's, are looking towards South East Asia to provide the next major boost in the increasingly international art market. Its chief executive Christopher Davidge reckons that already up to 15 per cent of its turnover comes from collectors there, and he anticipates holding auctions in China within five years. With its dynamic economy and the world's longest tradition of appreciating works of art, China could become the driving force of the market by the first decade of the next millennium. At the moment the mainland Chinese are interested primarily in stamps, jewellery , watches, jade, and Chinese paintings. If they follow the pattern of the Chinese of Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan, oriental ceramics and bronzes should be next on their collecting list. A taste for Impressionist art, to say nothing of Old Masters, may take a generation to develop, but in the meantime the auction houses will be doing everything in their power to speed up the process.</p>

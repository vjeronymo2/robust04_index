			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / Honda plans 50% expansion of UK carmaking capacity Honda is poised to announce a significant expansion of its UK car manufacturing operations, which could increase capacity by up to 50 per cent. The planned expansion of its UK plant, on a 370-acre site at Swindon in south-west England, forms part of a revised Honda strategy for Europe in the wake of German carmaker BMW's takeover of Honda's British partner, Rover Group. Under this strategy, Honda will also sharply step up its marketing activities in Europe and increase the size of its European dealership network by about one-half between now and the end of the decade. At present it has 1,700 dealers. The Swindon facilities, in which Honda has invested Pounds 370m so far, have a declared capacity of 100,000 cars a year, which is due to be reached next year. Last year Honda produced 32,139 cars and 116,035 engines at the Swindon plant. Output is forecast to rise to 50,000 cars and 150,000 engines this year, with car production set to reach 100,000 in 1995. Under the new strategy Honda is expected to move to substantially higher output well before the end of the decade, with the prospect of considerably higher employment at the Swindon plant than has been indicated to date. Currently the plant employs 1,400 people, with a further 600 to be be added by the time output reaches the 100,000 a year mark. The intention to expand is understood to predate British Aerospace's decision earlier this year to sell Rover Group to BMW. Initially the deal provoked a furious response from Honda. However, while Rover and Honda are selling back the shareholdings they took in each other, Honda has agreed to continue existing collaboration agreements. Those include replacements for the Rover 200/400 series and their Honda equivalent, the Concerto, which Rover has been building for Honda at Rover's plant at Longbridge, Birmingham. The replacements - code-named Theta by Rover and HH by Honda - are due to go on sale early next year. But under arrangements already agreed before the BMW takeover, Rover is to build only the Rover-badged versions at Longbridge, while Honda is to build the HH - expected to be called the Civic  -itself at Swindon.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Aleksandr Krylovich] </F>   [Text] Moscow March 17 TASS -- The chances that the third  round of talks between North Korea and the United States will be  held within the agreed upon time are very small, North Korean  Ambassador to Russia Son Song-pil said.    Meeting journalists in Moscow on Thursday, the ambassador  blamed the American side for thwarting the meeting planned for  March 21, saying that not a single obligation it has assumed  under the February 25 agreement has been fulfilled.    He stressed that North Korea has done its best to observe  the  conditions of the agreement, particularly it allowed  International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] experts into its  nuclear facilities and started consultations with  representatives of South Korea to prepare for the exchange of  envoys.    Son Song-pil brushed off accusations that North Korea  "treated IAEA exerts unsatisfactorily and did not grant them  access to some nuclear facilities." He described such  allegations as "a fabrication of the Western mass media."    The ambassador pointed out that recently the North Korean  Ministry of Nuclear Power Engineering received a telegram from  the IAEA deputy director which claimed that North Korea had  failed to provide normal conditions for the operation of IAEA  experts and overpriced materials they used for analyses.    "From the very first day of their stay in North Korea all  necessary conditions were created for their work," he said.  However, "their demands were too high and corresponded to a  large-scale rather than limited nuclear inspection which was  approved by North Korea," the ambassador continued. The  question of carrying out comprehensive inspection was due to be  discussed at the upcoming round of U.S.-North Korean talks, he  said.    Son Song-pil stressed that the fate of the third round of  talks depends on the U.S. Administration which should abandon  "unreasonable conditions" and strictly observe the agreements  reached by the sides at their February meeting.</p>

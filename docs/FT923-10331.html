			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / The Barcelona Olympics: Wrestling with hidden wit and skill  -Nicholas Woodsworth finds evidence to dispel some common myths ALEKSANDR KARELIN is a sensitive man. He does not look sensitive. He looks just like you might imagine a Russian heavy-weight Greco-Roman wrestler would. He is 6ft 5in tall, weighs 286lb, and has extremely long arms, a massive jaw, a lowering forehead and a close-cropped, bullet-shaped skull. But I know he is sensitive because he told me so, and he is not a man I would argue with. Karelin likes walking in Russian forests. He adores classical music. He not only reads poetry, he writes it. He has had offers to go to Hollywood. He makes the fact that he has not lost a wrestling match in more than 90 competitions since 1987 seem almost incidental. But there was nothing incidental about his Olympic gold medal victory on Wednesday evening over Sweden's Tomas Johansson. Only 1 minute 33 seconds into the five-minute bout, and leading 2-0, Karelin brought the match to an end with a conclusive four-point fall. Greco-Roman wrestling, it seems, is a sport that attracts sensitive men. In the last few days I have watched great exhibitions of emotion on the wrestling mat, displays more highly charged than one might expect from men who spend their days grappling with each other in sweaty gymnasiums. Teary sentiment from the winners is surprising enough, but it is the losers I find most touching. I have watched Cubans with years of ideological training to stiffen them collapse on the mat in despair. I have seen South Koreans as hard as nails led away howling their anguish. This is a sport that can make even the toughest men cry. Wrestlers may not look sensitive and intelligent, but their sport is a sport of wits. Wrestling is not an event that draws great crowds or massive TV coverage because - unlike ball games or athletics - the wit and skills involved are hidden. It is also a sport of hideously complex rules and prohibitions. Brute strength is not the essence of the game. What counts is technical ability, timing, agility, fast reflexes and endurance. After the first three minutes of a five-minute bout, reserves of pure muscle power dry up and technique becomes all. Adepts of the game say amateur wrestling - which has nothing of the fakery and crude spectacle of professional wrestling - is something like a game of chess. The aim is to analyse your opponent's style and then adapt your style so as to exploit his weaknesses. To win, a game plan is essential and there is very little time to develop it. Naturally, these mental processes are invisible to spectators. What we see is clutching, straining, groping, grimacing and a great deal of sweat. Wrestling holds the distinction of being the oldest sport in the world. But in spite of its name, Greco-Roman wrestling - it differs from Olympic freestyle wrestling in that no holds are allowed below the waist - bears little resemblance to wrestling as practised in the Games of ancient Greece. Then the wrestlers fought oiled, sand-powdered and naked. A match could last days, and was accompanied by music to keep spectator interest up. It was also, according to authorities on ancient sports, an event of homo-erotic associations for the participants and voyeuristic pleasure for the spectators. On Wednesday night the pleasure belonged to the supporters of the former Soviet Union's Unified Team. Not only did Karelin win the 130kg event, the heaviest of weight categories, but co-team member Oleg Koutcherenko, a Ukrainian, won gold in the 48kg event, the lightest. To even things up in the middle, Mnatsakan Iskandarian, an Armenian, took gold in the 74kg event. In Barcelona, former Soviet wrestlers have kept their traditional hold on the game. But it might not stay that way for long. Throughout the former eastern empire the withdrawal of state funding will seriously affect the future of most sports. Aleksandr Karelin says that now the Soviet-style school of wrestling has broken up, the synthesis of regional wrestling styles that made the Soviet Union great is no longer possible. The US, where college wrestling is popular, will be strong contenders in the future. So will Bulgaria, Japan, Korea and Poland. There is no blubbing in the Unified Team's wrestlers' changing rooms these days, but there may well be tears before bedtime four years hence at the Olympics in Atlanta.</p>

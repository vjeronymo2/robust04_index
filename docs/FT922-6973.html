			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / Westpac announces record loss WESTPAC Banking Corporation, Australian's biggest trading bank, has declared the largest loss in the country's banking history following a massive increase in property loan writedowns. The dividend has been cut and the capital base strengthened through a ADollars 1.2bn rights issue. It yesterday disclosed a ADollars 2.6bn (USDollars 1.96bn) turnround for the half year to March, sending it to a pre-tax loss of ADollars 2.32bn against a ADollars 313.4m profit last time. The bank's bottom-line loss was ADollars 1.67bn after a ADollars 713m tax credit and adjustment for minorities, compared with a ADollars 218m profit previously. The three-for-10 renounceable rights issue is at ADollars 3 a share. The issue will not be underwritten, and the price compares with Westpac's close of Dollars 3.89 in Sydney yesterday, down 5 cents. Mr Frank Conroy, managing director, said the bank anticipated a 'sound' profit in the current half and would pay a 12 cents a share interim dividend, against 15 cents last time. This rate was expected to be maintained for the full year. He said the Reserve Bank supported the company's conservative approach and had confirmed that, even after provisions, Westpac would satisfy official capital adequacy requirements. The Westpac loss follows bad and doubtful debt write-offs of ADollars 2.65bn, an increase from ADollars 579m last time. More than ADollars 2.1bn of write-downs reflect revaluations of the ADollars 6.3bn property portfolio. Mr Conroy said average revaluations were 34 per cent below book value. Westpac has also taken a much more pessimistic view of its 'problem' loans, increasing provisioning from 28 to 47 per cent, raising their value from ADollars 6.4bn to ADollars 8.2bn, or more than 10.6 per cent of the company's total risk-adjusted assets. Mr Conroy said shareholders would benefit in two ways. 'First, with the values recognised as current market value, the bank can implement a strategy of orderly disposal. But I stress the word orderly. There will be no fire sales or dumping of property on the market. 'Second, as the size of our property problem reduces, the burden on future profits from these non-performing assets will reduce.' Lex, Page 22; Background, Page 31</p>

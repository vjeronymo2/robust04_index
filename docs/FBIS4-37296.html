			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "I Saw, I Heard" column by Amnon Barzilay: "This </F> Is Christopher, Not Kissinger"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Relations between the Israeli  and the U.S. Governments have never been better. This is the  gist of a document drafted by the Foreign Ministry's Policy  Planning Division on relations between the two countries. The  threat of U.S. pressure has always hovered over Israel's head;  however, according to the document, which is classified as  secret, this threat has been withdrawn because of the  breakthrough in the peace talks. Washington considers Israel an  ally.    The most important piece of news regards the annual U.S.  aid,  to the tune of $3 billion. Until about a year ago, there was  talk of a certain gradual reduction in U.S. foreign aid. The  Policy Planning Division believes that the United States has no  intention of cutting foreign aid to Israel. The division even  goes as far as stating that "there is a promise that if Israel  becomes more vulnerable, the United States will agree to give  (Israel) more aid and more access to technology." It may be  assumed, therefore, that the scope of the foreign aid Israel  receives will only be changed in one of two instances: If the  Israeli Government halts the political process, the aid will be  cut. If, on the other hand, it should decide to "take  additional risks" -- a euphemism for a withdrawal from the Golan  Heights -- the United States may increase the aid.    And yet, one aspect of the Foreign Ministry document casts a  shadow on Israeli-U.S. relations. It has to do with the U.S.  secretary of state's determination to promote the peace talks  with Syria. These remarks, worded very vaguely, caused a slight  shock in Jerusalem and in the Israeli Embassy in Washington.  The embassy decided to react, because Itamar Rabinovich is not  only the ambassador but he also heads the Israeli team on the  talks with Syria.    A week ago, Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres received a  classified telegram from Rabinovich, written after a  consultation was held at the embassy. Some of the senior  embassy political staff claimed that the Planning Division  document was politically inspired by Foreign Ministry officials.  The embassy agrees that the U.S. Administration does not  attribute the same degree of importance to foreign policy as did  previous administrations. The debate is about whether  Christopher is doing enough. The document makes one feel that  Planning Division personnel are not convinced that the Americans  can be trusted to use the momentum in order to bring about a  breakthrough in the negotiations with Syria.    The Washington embassy discussion ended with different  conclusions. It is true that the negotiations with Syria are  stuck and that things will move slower than expected, but the  embassy does not believe that this delay poses a threat to the  entire process.    The ambassador's report to his political staff indicates  that  there never was a situation in which the American peace team was  not attentive or ready to take action to promote peace. Embassy  staffers claim that the ball is indeed in the Syrian court.  This is the stage at which al-Asad is called upon to come up  with better answers for Israel. Therefore, there is nothing  wrong with the secretary of state delaying his visit as long as  al-Asad is not delivering the goods.    Washington has discerned signals of distress in Syria -- for  example, in the Syrian media attacks on Israel last week. Syria  is concerned about the progress in the process with the  Palestinians and the developments between Israel and Jordan.  Christopher's delayed Middle East visit made al-Asad feel  pressured. If Israel also pushes Christopher, the embassy said,  it will be asking for pressure in return. [passage omitted]</p>

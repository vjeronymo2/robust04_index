			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / Russia demands veto over Caspian oil deals: Moscow's salvo seems designed to stall BP's Dollars 7bn project Russia has demanded the right to reject Caspian Sea oil projects that its former Soviet neighbours are negotiating with western companies, a move which could undermine some of the world's largest energy deals. In a previously undisclosed letter sent on April 28 to the British Embassy in Moscow, the Russian government declared that Caspian projects 'cannot be recognised' without its approval. Western diplomats regard the letter, evidently aimed at stalling a British Petroleum-led consortium negotiating a Dollars 7bn oil deal in Azerbaijan, as a new salvo by Moscow in its months-long attempt to reclaim a measure of control over the energy-rich sea. A source close to the Russian government said yesterday the position outlined in the letter would be officially announced within the next few weeks. The letter says 'the Caspian Sea is an enclosed water reservoir with a single eco-system and represents an object of joint use within whose boundaries all issues or activities including resource development have to be resolved with the participation of all the Caspian countries.' It concludes that 'any steps by whichever Caspian state aimed at acquiring any kind of advantages with regard to the areas and resources ..cannot be recognised ..(and) .any unilateral actions are devoid of a legal basis'. The letter also threatens two other massive projects, both in Kazakhstan, the Dollars 20bn Tengiz oil project and the Caspishelf oil and gas venture. Tengiz is largely offshore and has been awarded to the US oil company Chevron, while Caspishelf, is run by a consortium led by Mobil, with BP, British Gas, Agip, Statoil, Total and Shell. Russia's moves come two years after the Soviet collapse led to the dispersal of the Caspian's oil and natural gas reserves among Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Russia. In recent months Russia has demanded equity stakes in western energy projects in the region. Lukoil, a Russian state oil company, secured a 10 per cent share in the BP consortium in Azerbaijan. Moscow also appears to have achieved approval in principle for a stake in a giant British Gas/Agip venture at Karachaganak in Kazakhstan. The Russians are also thought to want an equity stake in Chevron's Tengiz field. But Russia's latest assertion that it has pre-emptive rights over Caspian energy ventures is the first concrete evidence that it intends to control the flow of oil and natural gas from the ex-Soviet Union to the west. Already, Moscow has achieved a large degree of success in steering the republics away from building new pipelines through Turkey or Iran. Oil and gas are now shipped through Russia, which enjoys complete control over the republics' hard currency energy earnings from the west. The letter to the British government is certain to frustrate the BP-led consortium, which in the past year has seen at least two apparently firm agreements on developing the Azeri and Chirag fields ripped up by the Azeri side. The latest talks in Istanbul follow a visit to London in February by Azeri President Heidar Aliev, during which he signed a document that reinforced the republic's intention to reach agreement with the western consortium. The companies include the US producers Pennzoil and Amoco, with Statoil of Norway, , McDermott, Ramco and the Turkish Oil Company. The Azeris, who need cash to finance the six-year-old war with neighbouring Armenia, is seeking a bigger share of the profit in the first few years of the 30-year deal than the western companies earlier agreed to. Under a previous agreement, the companies would receive the lion's share of initial profits until the Dollars 7bn development costs are covered - though they have already agreed to pay a Dollars 500m 'bonus' once the contract and a pipeline are agreed. The deal's eventual value is estimated at Dollars 118bn in oil sales over its lifetime.</p>

			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Equity Markets: Hong Kong - Other markets Investors in the Hong Kong market are likely to stay on the sidelines early this week, awaiting the outcome of tomorrow's US Federal Reserve open market committee meeting. Asian markets are expected to be weaker ahead of any decision on US interest rates. Market speculation is that the FOMC will increase interest rates by up to 75 basis points, and Hong Kong rates will subsequently be pushed upwards. If the rise in US rates is kept to 50 points, brokers reckon Hong Kong stocks could be in for a slight rebound. If the rise is 75 points, trading is expected to remain in a narrow range, with investors taking their cue from Wall Street. With little news on the corporate front, turnover is likely to remain thin - it was only HKDollars 1.7bn last Thursday, one of the quietest days of the year. Takeover rumours will continue to haunt second and third liners.</p>

			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Swiss take a sterner line on arms-related exports TIME was when the Swiss could, and did, get away with exporting weapons discreetly to anyone. No more. Last Friday Mr Walter Gubler, chief executive of Pilatus, a small Swiss aircraft manufacturer, was dismissed after reports in the press that the company had sold aircraft to the Burmese government knowing they would be fitted with weapons. According to other press reports, the company's PC-7 and PC-9 single engine training aircraft, modified for military use, had also been involved in conflicts in countries including Iraq and Angola. Pilatus, a subsidiary of the Zurich based Oerlikon-Buhrle weapons and engineering group, has admitted PC-9s were tested for weapons use in Burma in 1987 in the presence of two of its engineers. At a hastily called press conference, Mr Ernst Thomke, chairman, admitted the company had made fundamental mistakes and offended the spirit of the Swiss war equipment law. The company is clinging desperately to a SFr250m (Pounds 111.5m) order to sell 60 of its PC-7s to the South African government. Without the order there would be big redundancies among the 1,000 staff. Shortly after the order was announced last December, the South African committee of the UN Security Council complained to the Swiss government that it violated the UN embargo on arms shipments to South Africa. The Swiss government and Pilatus, backed up by Pretoria, said then that the aircraft were to be used only for training. They said the wings of the PC-7s needed to be strengthened to carry auxiliary fuel tanks because of the large distances flown in South Africa. But as evidence emerged that other customers had used the under-wing auxiliary fuel tank attachments for bombs, the Swiss government changed its tune. Three weeks ago Mr Kaspar Villiger, the Swiss defence minister, threatened publicly to block the order 'if it cannot be guaranteed that subsequent arming is ruled out by technical modifications'. Pilatus said last week that the wings of PC-7s and PC-9s ordered by certain countries would in future be modified so they could only carry additional fuel tanks.</p>

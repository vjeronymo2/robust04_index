			<p>BFN     [Text] Tianjin, April 15 (XINHUA) -- A large mosque, more  than 500 years old, has been rebuilt here in this northern China  port city.    Li Ruihuan, a member of the Standing Committee of the  Chinese  Communist Party's Politburo, wrote inscriptions for the mosque  on a tablet.    The Islamic northern mosque (Qingzhen Beisi), called "No. 1  Mosque in Northern China," can hold more than 1,500 people for  Moslem gatherings.    First built during the Ming dynasty (1368-1644) but  destroyed  in later wars and turmoil, the new mosque is much bigger and  complex than the original one, according to an executive from  the Islamic Association of China.    Most of China's Muslims live in North-West China, but  Tianjin  also has several thousand.</p>

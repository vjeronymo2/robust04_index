			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / Trafalgar House's auditors criticised SMALL shareholders at Trafalgar House's annual meeting yesterday surprised the board by voting against the reappointment of its auditors, Touche Ross, in protest at the company's decision to restate its 1991 accounts. Trafalgar immediately fell back on the support of its institutional investors by calling a proxy vote which overwhelmingly backed its decision to reappoint Touche Ross. But Mr Alan Clements, chairman, acknowledged the criticism from small shareholders. He said: 'The question of auditors is one we will have to return to. We will have a beauty contest on this matter later in the year.' Shareholders repeatedly voiced their anger that Trafalgar's pre-tax profits of Pounds 122.4m for the year ending September 30, 1991, had been restated as a loss of Pounds 38.5m. The Financial Reporting Review Panel decided that property write-downs should be taken through the profit and loss account and not through the reserves. Mr Alec Spurway, a small shareholder, asked to loud applause: 'What did the auditors think they were doing when they signed off the 1991 accounts?' Another accused Touche Ross of acting as the 'directors' poodle' instead of representing shareholders' interests. After repeated calls for Touche Ross to defend its performance, Mr David Jenkins, the partner responsible, argued that the 1991 accounts were true and fair before the company was forced to restate them. His comments were greeted with shouts of 'resign'. In defence of the auditors, Mr Clements said the 1991 accounts 'were right at the time'. But Mr Peter Jent, another small shareholder, asked him how he could reconcile what was said by the company in 1991 and what was going on now. 'It is very disturbing that we have been so badly misinformed,' he said. Others called for the company to be more open with their investors. Some shareholders argued that new faces were needed on the board after the present directors had made such a 'hash of the accounts'. Mr Clements concluded by saying: 'We are fully aware of what you think of us . . . and that some of you would like us to go as speedily as possible.' Trafalgar's ordinary shares fell 2p to 87p; the A shares fell 1p to 85p. Lex, Page 18; Observer, Page 17</p>

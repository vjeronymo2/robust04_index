			<p>Language: <F P=105> Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Provincial party committee Secretary Guan Guangfu  today delivered an important speech at the First Plenary Session  of the Sixth Hubei Provincial CPC Committee. He said: Now that  the Sixth Hubei Provincial CPC Congress has completely fulfilled  its agenda and the First Plenary Session of the Sixth Hubei  Provincial CPC Committee has elected the members, secretary, and  deputy secretaries of the standing committee of the provincial  party committee, we have accomplished the task of forming such a  collective leading body as the Sixth Hubei Provincial CPC  Committee. We also have endorsed a list of members, secretary  and deputy secretaries of the provincial discipline inspection  commission standing committee who were elected at the First  Plenary Session of the Hubei Provincial CPC Discipline  Inspection Commission.    The fact that we have been elected members of the Sixth  Hubei  Provincial CPC Committee shows that the broad masses of party  members and people in Hubei have placed their trust in us. At  present, Hubei is at an important juncture of reform, opening  up, and modernization building. So the newly elected Sixth  Hubei Provincial CPC Committee has been entrusted with a  glorious and arduous historical mission. We must rally closely  around the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the  nucleus; conscientiously implement and carry out to the letter  the spirit of the 14th CPC National Congress and the spirit of  the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee  under the guidance of both Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's  basic line; mobilize, organize, and lead the broad masses of  party members, cadres, and people in Hubei to firmly seize the  current historical opportunity and vigorously press ahead with  reform and opening up; carry forward our cause; forge ahead into  the future; make more progress and headway; strive to open up  new vistas for Hubei's work by adopting a new mental attitude  and a new style; fulfill all tasks laid down by the Sixth Hubei  Provincial CPC Congress; and strive to live up to the trust of  the party and the ardent expectations of the people.    Guan Guangfu also spelled out the following views on  stepping  up party building within the newly elected Sixth Hubei  Provincial CPC Committee:    1. To strengthen the study of theory. At present, Guan  Guangfu said, it is all the more imperative to study  conscientiously Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping, as well as the spirit of the Third Plenary  Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, with a view to  enhancing a sense of consciousness and of resolution with  respect to implementing and carrying out the party's basic line  and the party's principles and policies aimed at developing a  socialist market economy; scientifically, systematically,  farsightedly, and creatively carry out all types of work; and  study new theories, especially market economic theories and  modern science and technology, in light of the new conditions.  It should be noted that as we are still far from proficient in  these fields, we have yet to make redoubled efforts to catch up.    2. To carry out work in a realistic and down-to-earth  manner. By pooling the wisdom of all, the Sixth Hubei Provincial  CPC Congress worked out a number of strategic goals and tasks  for Hubei throughout the 1990s. Therefore, we should carry  forward a revolutionary spirit of hard work, plain living, and  selfless sacrifice in all types of work. First, we should  strive to develop democracy, prudently make decisions on a  scientific basis, and map out more realistic and feasible  policies and measures. Second, we should combine collective  leadership with division of work and responsibilities, clearly  define responsibilities for major sectors, and enable cadres to  assume personal responsibilities for their work. To this end,  various prefectures, cities, and autonomous prefectures, as well  as all major fronts, should firmly establish a system under  which party committee standing committee members are assigned  specific job-related responsibilities and are able to comprehend  and tackle major issues in a timely fashion. Third, we should  strengthen a sense of the overall situation and oppose selfish  departmentalism. Fourth, cadres should assume personal  responsibilities for their work and undertake to improve a  feedback analysis system. Fifth, we should conscientiously  carry out investigation and study, show more concern for  grassroots work, dispatch more cadres to grassroots level, go  deep among the broad masses of people as well as into the  reality, acquire first-hand information about grass-roots work,  personally listen to views of the masses; study new situations,  and tackle new problems. Sixth, we should bring into full play  the roles of various functional departments; cut down on the  number of entertainment activities in which provincial leaders  are involved; and reduce the number of meetings, documents, and  ordinary news reports. Members of the provincial party  committee standing committee should concentrate more efforts on  carrying out in-depth investigation and study, and on discussing  and tackling major issues.    3. To persist in a democratic centralism system. To this  end, first, we should persist in and perfect a system under  which the provincial party committee standing committee makes  regular work reports to the provincial party committee, and  under which major decisions are made after exhaustive  discussions among the standing committee members. Second, we  should strengthen the provincial party committee standing  committee's collective leadership. After the current plenary  session, we should immediately convene a provincial party  committee standing committee meeting at which we will study ways  and means aimed at establishing and perfecting several basic  work systems for the provincial party committee standing  committee, including a standing committee meeting system, an  investigation and study system, a work responsibility system, a  personnel appointment and removal system, a diligent and honest  government system, and so on. We also should work out a number  of specific, applicable, and detailed rules and regulations;  improve democratic activities; carry out criticism and self-  criticism; and constantly enhance unity within the standing  committee. Members of the provincial party committee and  standing committee should listen modestly to views from  different quarters and should consciously accept supervision by  the party and people.    4. To resolutely carry on a protracted struggle against  corruption and build a clean government. The newly elected  Sixth Hubei Provincial CPC Committee must strive to withstand  the test confronting the ruling party and the test of reform and  opening up, and should make resolute and unswerving efforts to  build a diligent and clean government and oppose all sorts of  corrupt phenomena. In accordance with the spirit of the  instructions of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council  on opposing corruption and building a clean government, I would  like to propose the following rules and regulations. I do hope  that leading cadres at all levels in Hubei will set a good  example in observing them: 1) Leading cadres should take the  lead in observing all five regulations promulgated by the  central authorities on performing official duties honestly and  abiding strictly by the law; 2) Leading cadres should take the  lead in carrying forward the tradition and style of hard work  and plain living, and in opposing all types of extravagance and  waste; 3) Leading cadres should avoid using luxury cars and  taking large entourages, and should spend money and have meals  according to relevant regulations whenever they go down to the  grass-roots level; 4) Leading cadres should not try to build,  decorate, or occupy residences in violation of relevant  regulations; 5) Leading cadres should use cars in accordance  with the relevant regulations and should not purchase luxury  cars or replace old cars with luxury models without official  approval. As the New Year and the Lunar New Year are coming,  all provincial party committee members should set a good example  in performing official duties honestly and abiding strictly by  the law.    5. To firmly adhere to economic construction as the center,  strive to deepen reform and expand opening up, take overall  interests into account, strengthen coordination among all  parties concerned, and make a success of Hubei's work with the  support of the broad masses of cadres and people.</p>

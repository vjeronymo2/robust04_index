			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / People: Swan's Marsh joins Babcock Alex Marsh, 48, a former chief executive of Swan Hunter, the troubled Tyneside shipbuilder, is joining Babcock International to help prepare its bid for the Rosyth Royal Dockyard which is to be sold off by the government. Marsh, who led the Pounds 5m management buy-out from British Shipbuilders in 1986, lost his job at Swan Hunter some months ago but had been acting as a consultant to Price Waterhouse, which was called in as the shipyard's receivers in May 1993. Swan Hunter, which used to be the UK's leading builder of surface warships, is faced with closure if the receivers cannot find a buyer. The yard's workforce has fallen from 8,300 ten years ago to about 600 and time is running out. The receiver has threatened to axe the firm's design and technical team at the end of the month and, if this goes, the prospects of being able to bid for new work disappear. France's Constructions Mecaniques de Normandie is the only company to show any interest in rescuing Swan but its willingness to take over the yard is dependent on Swan's winning new work. Ironically, one of the last chances Swan had to win new business, the refit of the Royal Navy's landing ship Sir Bedivere, went to Babcock's Rosyth yard last month. Babcock International has also been going through a rough patch. It lost Pounds 41.2m in its last financial year and its facilities management division, which manages Rosyth for the Ministry of Defence, is the most profitable part of its business. It contributed Pounds 10.5m last year but Babcock's management contract expires in April 1996 and the company has to plan how to respond to the government's decision to sell Rosyth. Babcock's new chairman John Parker is a former deputy chief executive of British Shipbuilders and his decision to bring in Marsh, another ex-British Shipbuilders' executive, will be seen as evidence of Babcock's commitment to hang on to its Rosyth business. Marsh joins at the end of the month as marketing and strategic director of Babcock's facilities management division.</p>

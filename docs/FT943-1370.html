			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / International Company News: Pirelli returns to black in first six months Pirelli, the Italian cables and tyre manufacturer, announced a modest return to profit after more than two years of tough restructuring and losses. Half-year results released yesterday showed net group profits were L54.6bn (Dollars 35.08m) against a loss of L62.7bn during the same period in 1993 while the parent company had swung to a L1.8bn profit from a L104.3bn loss. Mr Marco Tronchetti Provera, chief executive, has been predicting the group would return to profit and analysts said the recent movement in the group's shares suggested investors felt the worst was behind Pirelli. He also said that Pirelli would invest L2,200bn over the next three years, all self-financed, of which L1,000bn would be allocated to research and development. He forecast that there would be a new cables joint venture in the Asia Pacific region and said the group was aiming to concentrate on added value products with some L500bn of revenue coming from telecoms products by 1996. The restructuring has seen Pirelli reduce the number of plants from 102 to 80 and the workforce cut by more than 10,000 people to less than 40,000. In the first half of the year a further 1,019 jobs were pruned. Divestments over the past two and half years have helped slash the debt to L1,825bn from L4,000bn, thus reducing financial charges. The net debt equity ratio has improved, dropping to 0.60 per cent from 0.87 in mid-1993. The company said the accounts were no longer affected by restructuring charges. Reduced financial charges, along with leaner management and tighter control over costs were a large contributor to new profitability. Group sales were only marginally up at L4,687bn. Net equity stood at L,3,030bn in line with the first half of 1993. The company was cautious on full-year results, pointing to an as yet patchy recovery in many of its markets. Pirelli also warned about the unforeseen effects of industrial action at Pirelli Armstrong in the US. Mr Cesare Romiti, the chief executive officer of Fiat, leaves the board while Mr Riccardo Perissich, who has been director general of industry at the Brussels Commission, joins the board and will take charge of institutional relations.</p>

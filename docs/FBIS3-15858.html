Tajik Opposition Agreed for  the First Time To Hold Talks With Government" -- place and date  not given]    [Excerpts] The 6 March meeting of Russian diplomats with  leaders of the warring Tajikistani opposition in Tehran has  become an event of primary importance for the CIS' southern  regions. Anatoliy Adamishin, Russian first deputy foreign  minister, who headed the Russian delegation, gave an interview  to Sanobar Shermatova.    [Shermatova] Anatoliy Leonidovich, have the talks produced  any results?    [Adamishin] Two basic agreements have been reached. The  opposition has for the first time agreed to sit down at the  negotiating table with the government. Earlier, they refused to  do so, wishing to speak directly to the "masters," as they  called Moscow. The second point is that they agreed to come to  Moscow for the first meeting (previously they mentioned Tehran  or Geneva, fearing Tajik hitmen and being not completely sure  that they will have adequate security in Moscow). This is  understandable, given that very recently the Tajikistan  prosecutor's office ruled that opposition chiefs are guilty and  launched a search for them. Meanwhile, Tajikistan and Russia  have an agreement on legal assistance... Before going to  Tehran, I met with Tajikistan Supreme Soviet Chairman Emomali  Rakhmanov, who guaranteed the opposition absolute security at  the talks. [passage omitted]    [Shermatova] You met with leaders of the warring opposition  for the first time. What impression did they produce on you?    [Adamishin] Both Mr. Turadzhonzoda and Mr. Khimmatzoda are  people to talk to. As for former Tajik Foreign Minister  Khudayberdy Khaliknazarov, I met with him earlier and this is a  serious person. [passage omitted]    [Shermatova] Tightly tied in the Tajik knot are sometimes  conflicting interests of various circles in Dushanbe, Tashkent,  Moscow, Kabul, and Tehran. What is your forecast for the  evolution of events?    [Adamishin] I do not expect quick results from the talks; to  all appearances, they will be difficult and prolonged, all the  more given the great human suffering and losses sustained by  both warring sides in Tajikistan. But there is no other way --  either talks or further bloodshed. There can be no winners in  civil war. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><P> December 1, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PANAMA-FLAGGED VESSELS BANNED FROM U.S. PORTS  </P> <P> President Bush, trying to tighten the economic screws on Panama's Gen. Manuel  A. Noriega "and his puppet regime," Thursday banned Panamanian-flag vessels  from entering U.S. ports after Jan. 31.  </P> <P> "This ban is consistent with international efforts to further isolate the  Noriega regime, which is currently shunned by the democratic nations of Latin  America and around the world," the White House said in a statement.  </P> <P> The ban, announced as Bush prepared to leave for his weekend summit at Malta  with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, is in addition to a wide array of  U.S. economic sanctions already in place against Panama.  </P> <P> Noriega, who is under indictment in the United States on drug-trafficking  charges, has resisted U.S. efforts to oust him.  </P> <P> The action will affect about 1,500 merchant ships of more than 1,000 tons gross  that call each year in U.S. ports, according to State Department estimates.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Li Taoxin (2621 3447 2450) of the Central </F> People's Radio Station and XINHUA reporter Sun Yong (1327 0516)]    [Text] Beijing, 2 Feb (XINHUA) -- Li Ruihuan, member of  the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau Standing Committee  and chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative  Conference [CPPCC] National Committee, visited cadres at the  organs of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce  [ACFIC] this morning. He held informal discussions with them  and wished all ACFIC members a Happy Chinese New Year.    Wang Zhaoguo, vice chairman of the CPPCC National Committee,  attended the discussions. ACFIC Honorary Chairman Wang  Guangying, Honorary Vice Chairman Sun Fuling, Chairman Jing  Shuping, Vice Chairmen Zhu Wenju and Hu Deping, and Executive  Chairman Sun Anping [1327 1344 1627] reported on the ACFIC's  involvement in government affairs, its commercial activities and  operations, its development of overseas contacts, and its  operations in "uniting, helping, guiding, and educating"  representatives of non-publicly owned businesses. They also  spoke about problems which the ACFIC must resolve immediately.    During the discussions, Li Ruihuan fully endorsed the great  deal of work the ACFIC accomplished last year. He pointed out:  Ensuring the coexistence of all sectors of the economy, with  the publicly- owned sector the mainstay, has been a major policy  pursued by the party since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th  CPC Central Committee as well as an important element of Comrade  Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics. Over the past decade or so, this policy has  played an active role in developing the economy, helping the  market to flourish, improving living standards, and creating  jobs.    He said: At present, under the guidance of the guidelines of  the 14th CPC National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of  the 14th CPC Central Committee, the prospects for developing the  privately owned sectors of the economy are very good. Of  course, we are faced with new situations and problems. He hoped  that ACFIC cadres would emancipate the mind, seek truth from  facts, go deep into the realities of life, boldly explore, and  integrate theory with the practical situation to study these new  situations and problems and contribute to the development of  privately-owned sectors of the economy.    After the discussions, Li Ruihuan, Wang Zhaoguo, and others  inspected the offices of ACFIC organs to gain a better idea of  their working and living situations.    ACFIC Vice Chairman Jiang Minkuan presided over the  discussions. Vice Chairmen Zhang Xuwu, Huan Yushan [2719 3768  3790], Liu Minxue, Chen Jinxin, Qi Jingfa [7871 2529 4099], Wang  Zhiguo, and Liu Yimin [0491 0001 3046] as well as advisers  including Li Ding, Huang Liangchen, and Ye Baoshan attended the  discussions.</p>

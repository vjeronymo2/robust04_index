			<p><P> January 4, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P>  COMPUTER 'HACKER' AGAIN DENIED BAIL  </P> <P> A "hacker" charged with infiltrating computer systems in the United States and  England, was declared "a very, very great danger to the community" Tuesday by a  judge who renewed his imprisonment without bail.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge Mariana R. Pfaelzer made her ruling after Kevin David  Mitnick, 25, of Panorama City pleaded not guilty to computer fraud charges and  his attorney urged the judge to release him on bail.  </P> <P> Defense attorney Alan Rubin, who argued that Mitnick is "being held  incommunicado" and being treated more harshly than men charged with violent  crimes, accused the government of exaggerating the seriousness of the case.  </P> <P> Mitnick is accused of unauthorized use of MCI long-distance codes to tap into  computers at Leeds University in England and USC and of causing $4 million  damage to a Digital Equipment Corp. computer system.  </P> <P> Assistant U.S. Atty. Leon Weidman said additional charges will likely be filed  against Mitnick next week. "We believe he's extremely dangerous and should not  be allowed any access to a computer or telephone," Weidman said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 26, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> STATE;  </P> <P> 11TH GRADER KILLS SELF AT SCHOOL  </P> <P> Psychologists were called to Fairfax High School today to help students and  faculty deal with the death of a 17-year-old youth who fatally shot himself in  a school restroom in front of two fellow students on Wednesday.  </P> <P> Eric Poindexter, an 11th grader in his first year at Fairfax, was pronounced  dead several hours after he shot himself about 9 a.m. He apparently had been  suffering from depression.  </P> <P> Witnesses saw Poindexter bring a handgun to school. Some students reportedly  knew the youth was considering suicide but did not warn teachers, said  Principal Warren Steinberg.  </P> <P> Steinberg said the two students who witnessed the shooting were not  acquaintances of Poindexter. Classes were not otherwise interrupted at the  2,100-student campus west of downtown Los Angeles.  </P></p>

			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Shevardnadze shows compassion for peoples of former Soviet Union Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, the former Soviet foreign minister, who is trying to rescue his native Georgia from the ruins of civil war, has appealed to the west to show compassion for the plight of the peoples of the former Soviet Union, writes Leyla Boulton in Moscow. 'Nowadays when the idea of a community of mankind is triumphing, creating a world without frontiers or walls, I appeal to you to knock down the last wall - the wall of indifference,' he said in an open letter made available to the Financial Times yesterday. Referring to his personal role as foreign minister in tearing down the Iron Curtain 'so that your life would not be darkened by the threat of the war', he said the west owed a debt of gratitude.</p>

			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Tenants to fund housing benefit ALMOST Pounds 800m of the housing benefit available to council tenants in England will be funded by other tenants next year, according to figures highlighted by Mr Nick Raynsford, Labour MP for Greenwich. Mr Raynsford said the amount of housing benefit which had to be found from council tenants had risen from Pounds 200m in 1990-91 to Pounds 792m in 1993-94. This represented an average of Pounds 3.85 per week for every council tenant, and meant that in most local authorities' areas tenants would have to make some contribution, he added.</p>

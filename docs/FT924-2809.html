			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / US drugs allegation angers Mexico MR Manuel Bartlett, former Mexican interior minister, has vehemently denied claims by US federal prosecutors that he was involved in drug-running and in the 1985 murder of Mr Enrique Camarena, an official of the US Drug Enforcement Agency, writes Damian Fraser in Mexico City. The accusations were made during the trial of Mr Alvarez Humberto Machain, a Mexican doctor kidnapped by DEA agents to face charges in the US of aiding the torture and murder of Mr Camarena. The fall-out from the allegations may hit relations between the countries at a time when Mexico is keen to be on good terms with the incoming Clinton administration.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by UK Secretary of State for the Environment John </F> Gummer at a London Authority conference in London on 23  February: "Improving Air Quality"]    [Text] In the Sustainable Development Strategy, launched by  John Major earlier this month, we identified the continued  improvement of urban air quality as one of the major challenges  we face in the United Kingdom if the broad objectives of  sustainability are to be secured. Today I want to tell you how  we plan to move towards that objective.    Improving air quality is not an abstract, theoretical  matter.  It is a concern for large numbers of our citizens and an  important commitment of the government.    Much has already been achieved. On new cars, for example,  stringent exhaust emission standards now mean that catalysts are  a standard feature. And new diesel vehicles emit substantially  less smoke than we have become used to seeing in the past. All  existing vehicles are now checked for emissions in the annual  test to make sure that they are kept in a good state of tune. We  also have a comprehensive system for control of industrial air  pollution which the establishment of the Environment Agency will  further strengthen. These measures mean that we have seen a  progressive improvement in the quality of our air which should  continue over the next decade.    But new concerns are emerging. As increasing evidence  becomes  available of possible links between air pollution and  respiratory disease, we need to continue to question whether  enough is being done and then to identify areas where further  improvements can be made.    To set out the way forward I shall shortly publish a  consultation paper as the basis for a strategy to be published  in the Autumn.  <H3>  But Let Me Outline Now What I Believe Should Be the Key  Elements. </H3>   First, Air Quality Standards We must move quickly to get a  comprehensive set of health-related air quality standards in  place. In some areas, it may be some years before ambitious  targets can be achieved. But what is important is that we must  know where sustainability lies. We must know what acceptable air  quality is so that we can plan accordingly. There are some  standards already in place and we should build upon those. I  recognise also that the European Community is likely to bring  forward proposals over the next year or two. But I do not  believe we can wait. We must move ahead and link with our  European partners in due course. We have already made some  progress, notably with work on benzene and ozone this year. More  will follow rapidly over the coming months.    Second, Local Air Quality Management In our paper we shall  review the national policies, particularly emission controls and  economic instruments, which should help us move progressively  toward national targets. But air is inevitably also a local  matter, on which there must be local action. In areas where air  quality is particularly at risk, we need to be able to  coordinate our controls over domestic, industrial and vehicle  emissions to secure the most cost effective improvements. Local  authorities, the new Environment Agency and other bodies will  have a part to play here. We need to draw on the strengths of  our local planning system. When air pollution episodes arise we  need to be sure people can be informed, not only so that they  can take defensive action where necessary, but also so that they  can act in a sensible way in their use of vehicles and other  sources of pollution. In short, we must get to grips with the  need locally to manage our air quality.    Third, The Role of the Car is Critical Exhaust emissions are  the source of most air pollution in our urban areas. John  MacGregor and I are at one in the pursuit of a sustainable  future for transport which takes account of people's aspirations  for access, the crucial economic significance of transport, and  its wide impact on all aspects of the environment. Important  among these is air quality. Long term planning and transport  policies will make a contribution here. But we recognise that in  the shorter term, over the next few years, transport may also  need to play a greater part.    We are looking urgently at the scope for further tightening  of vehicle emission limits from around the year 2000, to build  on the measures already taken and the stringent limits to be  introduced after l996. We also recognise the need for further  action on smoky vehicles, where there may be scope for better  targeting of resources to deal with this particularly visible  problem. These can all play a part in developing the effective  management of air quality. We believe that it is also time to  get a better understanding of the effect that local traffic  measures have on air quality so that those effects can be better  taken into account, and the potential role of such schemes in  improving air quality can be explored. I know that some local  authorities are already beginning to explore these issues  themselves. With progress on these fronts, I do not see a need  for substantial traffic bans in our urban areas. We do not face  problems on the scale of Athens and Rome. Nor is it clear that  there is a need here to take the powers, taken for example in  Germany, to restrict movement by vehicles without catalysts  during pollution episodes, although that is something we should  keep under review.    What is clear is that we must take sensible and practical  steps in relation to vehicle regulation and management to  protect air quality, so that we can avoid the need for more  draconian measures which could significantly inhibit personal  mobility and economic activity in our urban areas.</p>

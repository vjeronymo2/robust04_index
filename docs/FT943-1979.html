			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Airways busy Shares in British Airways were heavily traded yesterday following a a profits downgrade from Merrill Lynch in the wake of mounting US-led price competition on trans-Atlantic routes. Turnover ran to some 4m trades with the shares sliding 7 to 373p. Merrill cut its profits forecast quite savagely from Pounds 480m pre-tax to Pounds 400, although the former figure was always at the top end of market expectations. What looked to have mostly worried dealers was the fact the the profits reappraisal came from a US house said to have its ear close to the inner workings of the US airways business. Enterprise Oil was the best performer among oil shares, as the market welcomed news of a promising oil discovery in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea. Enterprise and Esso Norge each have a 50 per cent stake in the discovery. Oil analysts were enthusiastic about the discovery, but said further drilling, to determine the extent of the discovery, would have to be made before they could appraise their net asset values for Enterprise. Enterprise shares settled marginally higher at 399p on turnover of 2m. The regional electricity stocks staged a strong rally after initial weakness with dealers talking of further actual and rumoured share buy-backs taking place. South Wales announced it had bought in a further 500,000 shares at 810p a share, while there were suggestions that Midlands was about to embark on a buy-in programme. South Wales shares eased 3 to 809p while Midlands climbed 11 to 787p. Northern Electricity's restructuring programme saw its stock price move up 8 to 794p. BT gave ground after negative comments from Kleinwort Benson, the shares sliding 5 1/2 to 374 1/2 p and the partly-paids 6 off at 254 1/2 p. Compel Group, the computer systems and services group, put on a creditable performance on its market debut, the shares, placed at 125p opened at 130p and eventually settled at 126p. There was no real disappointment across the market with Tesco's interim results which came out at the top end of analysts' forecasts; the dividend was in line with expectations. There were, however, some reservations about gross margins and sales, but these were not translated into big selling of Tesco shares which settled only 3 lower at 248p. Some dealers reported switching out of Sainsbury and into Tesco after the figures were released. Sainsbury shares dropped 9 to 427p, albeit in thin trade of 3.5m. William Morrison retreated 6 to 139p ahead of interims expected tomorrow. T &amp; N were resilient, closing unchanged at 224p ahead of a presentation by brokers Henderson Crosthwaite to investors in Frankfurt. The company has an option to acquire up to 52.5 per cent of the Kolbenschmidt pistons business. The brokers said a rights issue to fund the purchase had been discounted by the market and pointed to T &amp; N's 'track record of effectively managing acquisitions.' The retailing sector included a handful of good performers despite the overall market weakness and persistent worries about possible further rises in UK interest rates in the short and medium term. Storehouse advanced 4 to 206p after Kleinwort Benson Securities gave the stock a push on the view that the shares were undervalued. Next edged up 2 1/2 to 246p on heavy turnover of 3.2m following a reappraisal of the company's prospects in the wake of the recent interim figures. Williams de Broe, the stockbroker was one of the company's strongest supporters, labelling the shares a buy and insisting 'the stock's discount rating is unjustified.' Sears, on the other hand, suffered from a sizeable overhang caused by the stock's inclusion in a big programme executed in mid-session, in which a block of 3.9m shares were traded at 113p. Reg Vardy stood out among motor distributors, rising 2 to 170p on the back of a bullish chairman's statement pointing to a 10 per cent jump in August car sales and trading results well ahead of last year. BAA shed 12 to 473p with some 4m shares changing hands on modest profit-taking after the recent good run. Eurotunnel lost 6 to 273p, hit by the general market weakness and further reflection of Monday's announcement of the late start-up for the Shuttle service. Marked down as an interest rate sensitive stock - from the viewpoint of both its debt and the possible adverse impact on consumer spending - P&amp;O fell 10 to 645p. Inspec Group moved through the market although the price held steady at 223p.</p>

			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / International Company News: Imasco ahead 17% in spite of provisions IMASCO, the financial services, tobacco, fast-food and retailing group, posted a 17 per cent gain in profit in the final quarter of 1992 on revenues that rose only 2 per cent. The company has succeeded in turning around Hardee's, the US fast-food unit. In Canada, tobacco products continued to improve, but financial services were hit by bigger loan loss provisions. Drug stores did well, but other retail operations continued weak. Fourth-quarter earnings were CDollars 110.7m (USDollars 86.8m), or 88 cents a share, against Dollars 94.4m, or 74 cents, a year earlier. Revenues were ahead at Dollars 2.02bn, against Dollars 1.99bn. Operating profit for Imperial Tobacco, which has 66 per cent of the cigarette market, rose 8 per cent, while Canada Trustco's contribution dropped 70 per cent because of the special provisions. For the whole of 1992, Imasco, 40 per cent controlled by BAT Industries, reported net profit of Dollars 380.4m, up 15 per cent from 1991, equal to Dollars 2.97, against Dollars 2.56. Revenues were little changed at Dollars 7.98bn.</p>

			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets: Mexican investors await US decision on Nafta - A turbulent progress for equities In the next few months, Mexico's stock market is expected to boom or bust, depending on how 435 US congressmen and women, and 100 US senators, cast their votes on the proposed North American Free Trade Agreement. That, at least, appears to be the prevailing view. At the end of last week the IPC index retreated again, closing nearly 1 per cent down on the week after Mr Richard Gephardt, House majority leader, said that he would be voting against Nafta. Mexico has been one of the laggards among the IFC's emerging markets indices this year, showing a rise of around 4 per cent in dollar terms. The market stood slightly weaker at midsession yesterday. The market has been subjected constantly to the whims of the Nafta debate, with good news, such as the completion of the parallel agreements in mid August, leading to a rally while recent bad news, such as the unexpectedly strong congressional opposition to the treaty earlier this month, triggered a decline. The treaty is scheduled to come into effect on January 1, 1994 but, given the opposition from US Democrats, delay or even rejection remains distinctly possible. Investors view such an event with alarm, believing that it would force domestic interest rates up in the short term, slow down economic growth, and heighten uncertainties over future economic policies. 'The market is on a knife edge,' says Mr Jonathan Heath, head of Macro Asesoria Economica. 'Depending on the outcome of Nafta it could go up or down by 20 per cent.' Mr Heath is also director of research for Serfin Securities, which has a Nafta warrant that gives an investor the right to buy a put or call option on five leading Mexican stocks on January 10. If stocks rise or fall between now and then by more than 20 per cent, the warrant makes money. Other observers recommend Nafta hedge stocks - shares that will do well, or not so badly, if the treaty is rejected by the US congress. Such stocks tend to be those that would benefit, or be unaffected, by a rise in interest rates, a weakening of the currency, or a reduction in trade. Mr Carlos Fritsch of SG Warburg Securities points to Vitro, the glass company, which has more than half of its sales in dollars, and Cifra, the country's largest retailer, which has no debt and is domestically orientated; while Lazard Freyes likes tourism and mining companies. Those confident of Nafta's eventual passage will want to pick up bargains while there is still time. Brokers tend to recommend Cemex and ICA (both holding plenty of foreign debt), the banks (sensitive to interest rates) and transport companies like TMM, which is dependent on trade, as Nafta winners. The next Nafta development is likely to come when President Bill Clinton sends the treaty to congress, which he is expected to do before November 1. Such a decision will commit Mr Clinton irreversibly to Nafta, says Mr Fritsch, and may be taken as evidence that he believes the treaty can be passed by congress. Some investors complain that the market's obsession with Nafta has been overdone. Other factors have undoubtedly moved the market this year, especially the squeeze on corporate earnings. Unlike Argentina's, and Chile's, Mexico's economy is currently stagnant, showing growth of just 0.3 per cent in the second quarter, compared with 1.8 per cent in the same 1992 period. Even without Nafta, Mr Heath and other economists expect the economy to grow by around 3 per cent next year, to coincide with presidential elections next August. President Carlos Salinas has recently suggested that the government will increase spending modestly by using up the budget surplus earned in the first half of the year, while Dollars 22.6bn of reserves gives the central bank room to lower interest rates at some stage. 'Nafta is completely concealing what are some very strong fundamentals in favour of Mexico,' says Mr Geoffrey Dennis, head of emerging markets research for Bear Stearns in New York. Bear Stearns values Mexico's stock market at 11.9 times 1993 earnings, making it relatively cheap compared to a multiple of 16.5 in Argentina, and 14 in Chile. While Mr Dennis readily concedes that rejection of Nafta would hurt the market in the short term, he doubts that there would be any significant change in Mexico's pro-market economic policy, or any pressure on the exchange rate if the treaty were not approved. He bravely tells clients that there is a greater exchange risk in buying the German D-Mark than in the Mexican peso.</p>

			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Repeat of classic final may lie ahead It could be a repeat of the classic World Cup final of 1970. Today, Brazil and Italy, both three-time winners of the World Cup, have a chance of producing a rematch of that final in Mexico City 24 years ago when a Pele-led Brazil trounced the Italians 4-1 with breathtaking soccer. To reach this year's final on Sunday, Brazil must beat Sweden and Italy best Bulgaria in the semi-finals. Odds-makers expect them to do so. If Brazil and Italy survive, it will set up a Romario vs Roberto Baggio final, with several other intriguing rivalries on view, much like those in 1970. Then, Pele, Jairzinho, Gerson and Carlos Alberto scored the goals that downed Italy and won the world's admiration. Man for man, Italy probably had a stronger team in 1970 than it does now. But at least one problem looms for Brazil: a fired-up Roberto Baggio. In today's semi-finals, Bulgaria will face Baggio while the Italians must handle another in-form striker, Hristo Stoichkov. With good support from Emil Kostadinov and Yordan Letchkov, Stoichkov was a handful for Argentina and defending holders Germany - the two 1990 finalists - and Bulgaria beat both on the way to the semis. Brazil had problems dealing with Sweden in the first round, Romario scoring the equaliser in a 1-1 draw. The Swedes have top-quality attackers in Martin Dahlin (fighting injury), Tomas Brolin and Kennet Andersson but will be without influential mid-fielder Stefan Schwarz, who is suspended.  --------------------------------- Semi-Finals Today Italy vs Bulgaria New Jersey 9pm BST Brazil vs Sweden Los Angeles, 12.30am Thurs  --------------------------------- Final Sunday, July 17 Los Angeles 8.30pm  ---------------------------------</p>

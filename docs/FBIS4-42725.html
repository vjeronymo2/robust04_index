			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "A European 14th July"] </F>   [Text] Germany was not asked to take part in the  celebrations commemorating the 50th anniversary of the allied  landings in Normandy (6 June) and Provence (14 August).  However, German soldiers belonging to the Eurocorps, along with  French, Luxembourg, Belgian, and soon Spanish troops, will  parade down the Champs Elysees on 14 July. Meant to end all  misunderstandings once and for all, Francois Mitterrand's  invitation has been enthusiastically received by Helmut Kohl.    This initiative is reminiscent of another one back in 1984,  when these two men, holding hands, paid their respects to all  the victims of World Wars I and II. Elderly Parisians probably  remember seeing the Wehrmacht, complete with marching band,  march down the same Champs Elysees in 1940.    Over half a century later, after reconciliation was achieved  by Charles de Gaulle and Konrad Adenauer, the two countries  persist in stepping up cooperation in all fields, including  defense. Should such a symbol be disavowed? Mitterrand and  Kohl have chosen both to eschew forgetfulness and to advance  European integration, even though everything is not perfect in  the Franco-German dialogue.    The Eurocorps itself is a symbol that goes beyond the  relations between the two countries. This 45,000-strong army  corps, scheduled to become operational in late 1995, will be  integrated into a broader organization (either NATO or the WEU  [Western European Union]) with a view to ensuring European  security. It is a blueprint of a European army which is not yet  called as such. Accordingly, other partners have been asked to  participate, among which Luxembourg, Belgium, and Spain, which  will all contribute troops.    In such a context, the Eurocorps is one of the entities on  which Europe's defense system will be based, as are the  German-American, German-Dutch, and multinational (under British  command) corps now being put together. However, the Eurocorps  is much more than that. It should one day become the hard core  of a European peacekeeping, or even peacemaking, force, either  placed under UN command or controlled totally or in part by a  single European command, depending on the decision arrived at by  each government involved.    The Eurocorps' parade on the Champs Elysees can be seen as  the first step toward a future European commitment to ensure the  stability of its own continent. Ten days before the European  election, the initiative of the president of the Republic may  also aim to convince those who have been condemning European  apathy in the Yugoslav crisis that there are reasons for hope.</p>

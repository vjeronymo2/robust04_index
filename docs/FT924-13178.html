			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / Letter (3): Coal seen as victim of muddled economic thinking and lack of long-term strategy Sir, Everyone seems agreed that a major cause of the persistence of the current recession is that so many people engaged in herd-like over-investment in property. We now learn that most of our coal industry is to be closed because 43 natural gas power stations are being built, or have been proposed. I wonder whether there is any similarity between these phenomena? David Blake, 42 Wilmington Square, London WC1X 0ET</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Michal Berko on a news conference </F> by Gebhardt von Moltke, deputy to the NATO secretary general for  political affairs, and Slovak State Secretary Jan Lisuch in  Bratislava on 28 February; passages within quotation marks are  recorded; von Moltke speaks in English with superimposed Slovak  translation]    [Text] A delegation of experts and high-ranking  representatives of NATO came to Slovakia today. It is headed by  Gebhardt von Moltke, deputy to the NATO secretary general for  political affairs.    After the talks at the Slovak Republic Foreign Affairs  Ministry, where they were received by State Secretary Jan  Lisuch, they met journalists. Michal Berko reports:    [Berko] The aim of the visit from Brussels is to specify the  implementation of the Partnership for Peace program, State  Secretary Jan Lisuch said and added:    [Lisuch] "As to the Slovak Republic, we note that,  altogether, we are prepared for participation in the Partnership  for Peace program. We have been training people who will be  active directly at the Coordination Center. Naturally, we  consider the Partnership for Peace program a beginning of  political and military cooperation with NATO, the first step  toward future activities as members in NATO."    [Berko] After this brief explanation, Gebhardt von Moltke  took the floor. He said that Slovakia had been very intensively  involved in cooperation with NATO, that the Partnership for  Peace program was not the beginning of this cooperation, but  that it gave it a new dimension. It was based on the interests  of the Slovak Republic. He recalled the good results of  cooperation within the UN peace operations. He welcomed, above  all, the fast and positive reaction of the Slovak Government in  signing the framework document by Prime Minister Meciar. The  talks we had here were open and took place in a friendly  atmosphere, he said. He expressed the hope that a presentation  [as heard] document will be quickly prepared in Slovakia on a  sufficiently high authoritative level that would make it  possible to transform the Partnership for Peace program into an  implementation form. It should express the individual approach  of Slovakia toward membership, but it should be a document that  will endorse Slovakia's political obligations. Membership in  NATO was not a membership in a stamp-collecting club, Gebhardt  von Moltke said.    Asked whether NATO had an order for accepting the countries  of Central Europe--the question that was brought up by former  U.S. Defense Secretary Dick Cheyney when he said yesterday that  one had to quickly accept Hungary, Poland, and the Czech  Republic into NATO, while omitting Slovakia--Mr. Moltke said  dryly: Mr. Cheyney was defense secretary, but then he added:    [Moltke] "I want to assure you that NATO has no pecking  order, that it has not made any preliminary selection for  acceptance."    [Berko] Answering numerous questions as to what extent the  process of the Partnership for Peace program can influence the  development in Russia [words indistinct], von Moltke said that  we considered expanding NATO as an element of stability also for  Russia. All, however, depended on the behavior of Russia. As to  the address by Boris Yeltsin, Mr. Moltke said that it was  motivated by the internal political development in Russia.  Russia, however, was an important element of stability and  European security, and we wanted to cooperate with Russia if it  were willing to defend and cooperate on the basis of democratic  principles.    [Moltke] We do not want to create new divisions and borders  in Europe.</p>

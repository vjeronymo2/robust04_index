			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Arts: Opera and other gems - Max Loppert begins and ends with a mezzo in a million SEVERAL new and reissued opera recordings dominated my listening year. Gloriana, last of Benjamin Britten's operas to reach the recording studio, gets an exhilarating, thoroughly committed performance from Welsh National Opera forces under Charles Mackerras; the superb Elizabeth I of Josephine Barstow and Essex of Philip Langridge lead a first-rate cast. The work itself is not free of dramatic imbalance, flummery and rhubarb; but its richness of musical content and astute approach to foreground personal conflict render the flaws of small account (Argo 440 213-2). Two 1993 sets of more familiar works - Rossini's Cenerentola and Tchaikovsky's Queen of Spades - seem to me already the most completely recommendable modern versions. The former, in Decca's sparkling Bologna-based edition conducted by Riccardo Chailly, has an all-Italian cast (rare in modern Rossini), lively but unforced character (rarer still), and the glowing, tender-hearted heroine of young Cecilia Bartoli, already a mezzo in a million (Decca 436 902-2). The latter, in the third issue of Philip's Kirov Opera series, is magnificently conducted by Valery Gergiev and well sung by Gegam Grigorian, Maria Guleghina, Vladimir Chernov and Irina Arkhipova; it adds up to a whole, and wholly commanding, view of the terrifying masterpiece (Philips 438 141-2). Off the main operatic route is the Opera de Lyon double-bill of German-language one-acters by the Tuscan-born Ferruccio Busoni - Arlecchino, stylised commedia dell'arte, and the 'other' Turandot, both from the second decade of our century. If Verdi's Falstaff were infused with bittersweet Weill, then stiffened with tough-minded Hindemith, something like these two collector's items might result. Mixed bag of singers excellently conducted by Kent Nagano (Virgin Classics VCD 7 59313 2). Even more rewarding, to my mind, is Martinu's 1938 Julietta, a mysterious, romantic, deeply affecting exercise in operatic surrealism. The 1964 Prague National Theatre recording, now finely transferred to CD, merits its cult following (Supraphon 10 8176-2). Another reissue that deserves equal cult enthusiasm is the Paris (tenor) version of Gluck's Orpheus in the 1956 recording conducted by Hans Rosbaud, distinguished above all by the Apollonian nobility of Leopold Simoneau's exquisitely-voiced hero (Philips 434 784-2). I took endless pleasure from the reissues of two great violinists of eras past. Fritz Kreisler, in a double-album of Victor recordings from the 1920s, carefully restored on the specialist Biddulph label (LAB 068-69), and also in a single disc of more general compilation (EMI References, CDH 7 64701 2), is the first - gloriously subtle, sensuous, charming, a musician without peer in alchemising his (often trivial) material. Leonid Kogan, whose 1959 performances of four popular concertos come in a handy EMI double-pack (7 67732 2), is the second - perhaps not the most trumpeted of the leading postwar Soviet players, surely the most 'inward' of that elite, most refined, most poetic. Among new symphony readings worth special attention are Frans Bruggen's Haydn 100 and 104 (Philips 434 096-2) and Schubert Great C major (Philips 438 006-2), both with Bruggen's Orchestra of the 18th Century and both bursting with spring-heeled new life; naturally shaped, spontaneously musical accounts of Mendelssohn's Scottish and Italian from the San Francisco Symphony under Herbert Blomstedt (Decca 433 811-2); and a simply sensational one of Prokofiev's Third - the riotous, swirling, irresistible symphonic re-thinking of the opera The Fiery Angel - from the Philadelphia Orchestra under Riccardo Muti (Philips 432 992-2). Stravinsky's two-piano (or four-hand) music, including the 'black-and-white' version of The Rite of Spring, is put across with dazzling zest by Vladimir Askenazy and Andrey Gavrilov (Decca 433 82902). Esa-Pekka Salonen's Stravinsky series for Sony gains new lustre from its latest addition - a beautifully keen, purposeful reappraisal of Orpheus, most unjustly neglected of the neo-Classical ballets, coupled with an equally keen but slightly over-assertive Petrushka (SK 53 274). The Virgin Classics disc devoted to the music of Oliver Knussen, including the Songs without Voices and Hums and Songs of Winnie-the-Pooh, is modern music at once toughly made and captivating to the ear, small in scale but not in ambition (VC 7 59308 2). A handful of vocal gems to end. Michael Chance, the most appealing countertenor voice of our day, offers with Christopher Wilson a programme of Lute Songs touched by grace, sensitivity and eloquent understatement (Chandos CHAN 0538). DG's two-disc reissue (437 348-2) of Lieder by the unforgotten, still-lamented Irmgard Seefried delights, stirs and uplifts in the sound of every robustly communicative word and note (and this even when the voice itself was caught in less than perfect estate). And finally, back to Cecilia Bartoli, partnered by the pianist Andras Schiff, for a programme of Italian songs by Beethoven, Mozart, Haydn and Schubert that gave me greater and more continuous joy than any other record released this year (Decca 440 297-2).</p>

			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / International Company News: Debt ratings lowered at leading Japanese banks MOODY'S Investors Service, the US credit rating agency, yesterday lowered ratings of two leading Japanese banks due to mounting concerns over deteriorating loan portfolios. The long-term debt rating for Long-Term Credit Bank was cut to A3 from A2, while-short term deposits were downgraded to Prime-2 from Prime-1. The agency also lowered long-term debt ratings of Norinchukin Bank, the central agricultural financial institution, from Aa3 to A1. The Prime-1 rating for short-term deposits was confirmed. Moody's said as well as disclosed non-performing loans, LTCB had a substantial volume of loans to restructuring non-bank financial institutions. It said LTCB faced risk posed by closely-linked real estate companies and by non-bank financial institutions facing financial stress. The agency expressed concern over Norinchukin's high exposure to housing loan companies. Norinchukin's profits were depressed by the need to aid low-margin operations of small agricultural co-operatives. The bank is also increasing its reliance on securities gains to boost its earnings. Earlier this week, Moody's lowered credit ratings of Asahi Bank, a Japanese commercial bank, due to concerns over continuing vulnerability of asset quality and outlook for weak core profits.</p>

			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / International Company News: Gencor announcement on Shell deal delayed Gencor, the South African mining and metals group, has postponed the announcement, planned for yesterday, of details of its long-awaited USDollars 1bn deal to buy the Royal Dutch/Shell group's mining and metals operations. However, Mr Bernard Smith, Gencor's new business director who has been leading the team negotiating with Shell, was quick to assure the market that the talks were still on course. 'We still have some issues to settle but none is substantive at this state. The heart of the deal is concluded.' Mr Smith insisted an announcement was only days away. Meanwhile, it emerged yesterday that Gencor had raised about USDollars 200m towards the deal from the sale of its stin Transatlantic Holdings, the London-listed life insurance and property group owned by Liberty Life of South Africa. Gencor owned 8.4 per cent of Transatlantic, including its holding of convertible shares. The South African group has arranged to raise more money for the acquisition from a consortium of European banks. Gencor shed its non-mining and metals businesses in South Africa when it unbundled its assets there last November. The deal with Shell, to buy assets mostly under the Billiton banner, is intended to make Gencor an important force in international mining. Gencor originally intended to acquire the Billiton assets - which, when the deal was first proposed a year ago, were worth about USDollars 1.8bn - and merge them with its own operations outside South Africa as well as its R1.5bn (Dollars 417m), 50 per cent stake in Richards Bay Minerals in South Africa. The combined group would then have been floated in London. Gencor was considering partners to help finance the deal. In the past year, Shell has decided to sell some of its mining operations separately - which will reduce the value of the deal. There were suggestions yesterday that Shell might retain a minority stake in Billiton. However, difficulties have apparently arisen over the transfer of the Richards Bay stake from South Africa to the new company.</p>

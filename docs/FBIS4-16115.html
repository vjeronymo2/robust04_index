			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From April 14, HOMMIKULEHT, PAEVALEHT, p 3; "News Bulletin" </F> No. 71]    [Text] Head of the Defence Ministry section of defence  policy Enn Tupp announced that Estonia needs a political  document determining Estonia's military doctrine and the use of  funds allocated for defence needs.    The document on the basics of national defence, formulated  more than a year ago, is superficial and somewhat naive, Tupp  said. He added that the first stage of introducing total  defence was completed with the passing of the law on  conscription. A draft law on peacetime defence is currently  debated by the Riigikogu [parliament] and the draft law on  wartime defence is to reach the parliament in a month.    Tupp discussed further Estonia's defence capability,  stressing that a direct aggression is unlikely in the near  future, but that the Defence Forces must be capable of  countering any minor conflicts. He stressed the importance of  training the reserves and also predicted that Russia will  complete the troops withdrawal by August 31, despite the  invalidation of the corresponding item in the draft agreement.  "The Russian military here are a political plaything, rather  like the Skrunda radar station in Latvia," he said. Head of the  ministry information section Jyri Kork added that approximately  30-40 Russian military are leaving Estonia every week.    Kork also discussed the strength of the Defence Forces,  announcing that approximately 450 men out of full complement of  800 are present in each infantry battalion. However, only one  third to a half of the officers' posts are currently occupied.</p>

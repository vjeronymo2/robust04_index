			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Edhem Bicakcic, member of the Bosniak </F> delegation at the Vienna talks, by Amir Hodzic in Vienna; date  not given -- recorded]    [Text] [Hodzic] Mr. Bicakcic, how much territory will the  federation cover -- its borders have been set -- and,  percentage-wise, how many people will it include?    [Bicakcic] This issue -- establishing the external borders  of the federation -- was one of the easier issues, and the  Bosniak and Croatian delegations relatively quickly reached an  agreement on it. The territory of the federation covers 58  percent of the territory of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina,  including the 3 percent of the Sarajevo district territory.    On this territory the Bosniaks and the Croats are in the  majority, which means that the Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly's  decision that territories with majority Bosniak and Croatian  populations should be included in the federation, has been  followed to the letter. Apart from the 58 percent of  Bosnia-Herzegovina territory, the Croatian and the Bosniak  delegations also expressed an interest in places that would  remain under the Serbian aggressor's occupation where Bosniaks  and Croats were in the majority. These are larger cities such  as Bosanski Petrovac, Bosanska Gradiska, Bosanska Dubica,  Bijeljina, Janja, and [word indistinct], which cannot be covered  by the federation territory, but -- in future negotiations, when  they take place -- we will try to obtain from the Serbian  aggressor the protection of human rights for the population in  these areas.</p>

			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / The Lex Column: Granada Group It looks as though Derek Lewis's days in charge of Granada may be numbered. The shares have underperformed by more than 50 per cent sincethe beginning of 1989 and institutional shareholders appear to be baying for blood. Mr Lewis cannot be blamed for all the recent errors - but he is rightly held accountable for the costly diversification into computer services. Even if the basic thinking cannot be faulted, management feuding between the division's component parts should have been stopped sooner. The most important question, though, is when the long-rumoured rights issue will finally materialise. Granada is highly geared - more than 80 per cent on the basis of the last published report and accounts - and capital spending, though down, is likely to be around Pounds 200m in the current year. Still, the group can relieve the pressure through disposals, with bingo likely to be first on the block. Delaying an issue till the end of the year to take advantage of hoped-for signs of economic recovery, a clearer outlook for BSkyB and a renewed TV franchise might seem attractive. Against that, there is currently a proven appetite for paper - at least with Mr Lewis out of the way - and some may feel it prudent to strengthen the balance sheet ahead of the forthcoming TV bid. The Independent Television Commission, which will award the franchise, is clearly minded to give Granada another term - as long as its overall corporate health can be demonstrated.</p>

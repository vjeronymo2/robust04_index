			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Third of an unspecified number of installments of an </F> "abridged" interview with Abdullah Ocalan, leader of the Workers  Party of Kurdistan, PKK, by correspondents Ertugrul Kurkcu,  Ragip Duran, and Behcet Avsar in Barr Ilyas in Lebanon on 21  March]    [Text] [OZGUR GUNDEM] According to a demographic  prediction, the Kurds will form the majority of the population  in Turkey within 30 years. What will relations among the Kurds,  Turks, and other people be in the long term?    [Ocalan] I liken the situation to the Byzantine period. Just  the way Turkification started and developed soon after the  Turks' penetrated Anatolia, a Kurdish invasion has now started  from the East. The Kurds' inventiveness and poverty might  exhaust the west of the country, that is, they might become a  majority in the west. This won't be a good solution.    [OZGUR GUNDEM] Considering that we might become the majority  in the country, what is the situation regarding the expression  of the identity, language, and culture by other non-Kurdish  peoples? Are you thinking of guaranteeing these rights to them?    [Ocalan] We are aware of this situation. Specifically, there  are influential cultures: the Assyrian and Syriac. There are  also the Armenians.    [OZGUR GUNDEM] There are Zazas, are there not?    [Ocalan] The Zaza culture is the oldest Kurdish culture. I  do not consider it something separate from the Kurds. The other  cultures must be regarded as different species. We can go as  far as to grant them political autonomy. Let them freely  express their own identity and culture. A democratic culture  must be created in Turkey. It might make sense to be  authoritarian in politics but strangulation of a culture is  meaningless! You can only wish that even the smallest  communities, such as the Turkmens, Lazes and Circassians, could  also open up like flowers. Some synthesis of these cultures  could be developed. There is a need to be open to various  formations, ranging from a federation to confederation. It is  vital that the multiplicity of opinions and cultures should not  be destroyed with the argument that "we are being divided."  Turkey's destruction of culture caused the peoples enormous  spiritual and linguistic poverty. It is time to halt this  trend! Yes, we understand the aims behind the political  centralization but what should we make of this strangulation of  cultures? This is the extremist form of Kemalism. I firmly  believe this is not enriching Turkey. There is a mentality that  favors forging national unity by force. Let us say that  Turkey's population is 40 million. But they are bragging by  saying: "We are 60 million." Suppose you are 200 million or  even 1 billion. What is the purpose behind this? They might be  thinking of swallowing the entire world. Let us suppose that  you swallowed the world. By the way, Hitler too was thinking  along these lines. Let us suppose that you Turkified the entire  world. This would mean the end, the desertification of the  world. But the existence of many cultures and languages is  life's blessing. Is it not? Be content with a 40-million  population and beautify its language, culture, economy, and  spiritual life so as to lead to a better life. Then your  neighbors and cultures within your common borders will be a  source of pleasure and enrichment. I think that people nowadays  are music fans. Let them also listen to Kurdish music. Allow  every other culture freedom. Besides, you are acting with  duplicity when it comes to exploiting cultures. You should  appear before the world with your own identity to help forge  better human relations.    I liken the situation of Kurds to that of a woman who gets  bedded and nothing more. She is always told: "Let us live  together." But she is not allowed to speak and is asked to  "Look at me with rapture and say how great I am." Meanwhile, you  have severed her tongue and gouged out her eyes. This is a  tragedy. So any move toward a solution would entail a broad  democratization and decentralization. The centralization will  be to a degree that the peoples want. We will not accept  centralization simply because some army generals and bureaucrats  want it for their own interests. For me the so-called national  unity of Turkey is not to the benefit of the Turkish people. It  reflects the interests of some army generals, bureaucrats, and a  political elite. It does not reflect the interest of the  Turkish people. The soldiers are nervous. Why? Because the  position of the army generals is under threat. If they lose the  war [against the PKK] the army generals will lose their  privileges. They are waging a war for their own positions; they  are not waging the war of the Turkish people. These things  should be known well.    I believe in the democratic alternative. A Turkey sunk  deeply in Kurdistan is an asphyxiated Turkey. A Turkey bent on  annihilating the Kurds is a Turkey chased out of Anatolia. This  is not the path of reason. In old times the Turkish  revolutionaries wanted to get rid of such leaders. I think this  possibility should be considered. We must raise the issue of how  much longer these people who commit crimes against the peoples  can stay on the land. They will go but peoples will remain and  develop their own democratic alternatives.    [OZGUR GUNDEM] You are talking like Turkey's  revolutionaries.    [Ocalan] In this regard we are not working merely as Kurdish  revolutionaries. Our function rests in being Turkey's  revolutionaries. It might sound paradoxical but, as in times  past, when it was stated that "any political party in Turkey is  also a Kurdish party," now we are saying: "A Kurdish party is  also a party of Turkey." I was told that Mahir Kaynak [a  Turkish leftist] was amazed that "there is no enmity against  Turks within the PKK." Why should there be such enmity? It  simply cannot be. Our enmity is against the oppression of the  peoples. There are many Turkish boys and girls fighting with  us. We live together every day. There is unbelievable,  harmonious unity among them. They don't feel that "These are  Kurds; we should be scared of them." We have no enmity or  hostility against the Turks. Ours is a great fraternal and  internationalist expression. There is no reason we should  ignore this aspect of relations and harp on about what they did  "to other Turks, Armenians, and Greeks or say they are the  extension of various foreign forces." Those who say such things  are the stooges of foreign forces.    [OZGUR GUNDEM] While we are at it, there are reports that  permanent missions of the PKK or ERNK [National Liberation Front  of Kurdistan] will be opened in the Greek capital of Athens and  the Russian capital of Moscow. What is the diplomatic  importance of opening these missions in Russia and Greece, which  are considered the traditional "enemies" of the Turks and with  which you do not have traditional ties?    [Ocalan] The opening of our missions in these countries  undoubtedly is linked with Turkey's traditional enmity against  the Kurds and Greece. There might be historic reasons for these  countries' interest in us but we are not thinking of  "surrounding the Turks with enemies or retaliating by imposing a  suffocating ring around her." Such thinking comes from Turkes  [leader of the Nationalist Movement Party], who is frightening  the public by claiming: "They [the Kurds] want to throw us out  of Anatolia." It will be senseless for us to follow such a  policy, knowing full well that eliminating Turks in such a  conflict would also mean the elimination of the Kurds. The  Kurds will not be eliminated in this manner.    [OZGUR GUNDEM] What then?    [Ocalan] The Turks can no longer impose on us a policy that  is against the interests of the Kurds and has reached the stage  of destroying the identity of the Kurds. The Kurds can't be  suppressed as in the past; this is obvious. Millions of Kurds  -- here we should add all the Kurds in other sundered areas --  have reached a consensus on this. Some 40 million Turks will be  confronted by 40 million Kurds. If we launch a century-long  war, nothing will remain of the Turks. The way to forestall  this is for the farsighted people who want to stave off the  danger to take charge of the situation. But this cannot be done  by attracting a few Kurdish collaborators to the government.  This problem cannot be solved by saying: Let us suppress and  destroy the Kurds and "then we can give them something."    [OZGUR GUNDEM] Well, where does the solution rest then?    [Ocalan] In a free democratic atmosphere! There should be an  opportunity for the free exchange of views and political choice  by removing the shadow of coercion. What I really mean is using  the right of engaging in secure politics. If you guarantee this  security throughout Turkey, I will have no other demands  concerning the Kurdish problem. I want to engage in politics in  an atmosphere in which arms are silent. This is a reasonable  right. If you give the guarantee, then I will go in among the  Kurds and Turks and engage in politics. If there is a real  desire to end this war, I am all for it, really. And I will  propose no preconditions regarding the Kurds' demands. Let the  use of force be removed. Yes, to engage in free politics...    [OZGUR GUNDEM] I am pleased to hear this. I have an actor  friend who knows nothing beyond the propaganda in the press.  When I told him that "Apo [alias for Abdullah Ocalan] might be  satisfied with entering the parliament as a deputy from  Diyarbakir or might be satisfied only with forming his own  party," he replied: "Is that all?" I just wanted to mention  this.    [Ocalan] Of course. This will require some negotiation.  What I am saying is: Let us smooth these problems over. The  use of political rights depends on particular guarantees. If I  go there today, they will detain me and hang me tomorrow. The  DEP [Democracy Party] was ostensibly given the right to engage  in politics but now its members are facing execution on charges  of being "traitors to the country." But I would want to engage  in secure politics. I will seek security in the Constitution  and the law. Not satisfied with that, I will ask for particular  institutional measures. Being a democrat, I believe in a  Kurdish identity. I will address the people with this identity  of mine. This should have a place in the law. Let us make the  necessary changes. Why should you [the Turks] impose your own  arrangements on me by unilaterally denying everything that  defines me? Will anything remain of democracy if you act like  that? In the context of democracy there should be Kurdish  parties and social and political institutions. There are lots  of local problems to be tackled. So there will be local  administrations. There will be local parliaments. But there  are also things to be tackled together with the Turks. We will  carry out joint government and parliamentary work. Some do not  want to understand this. Let them come to me. I will explain  all this in one go. I did not attend the law faculty but I can  show them how to do what. I am looking for a counterpart. Let  anyone with confidence in himself come here so that we can  rearrange all these things within the context of Turkey's unity  and territorial integrity.    [OZGUR GUNDEM] Who do you want? Who will we bring to you?    [Ocalan] Anyone. I am even ready for an ordinary civil  servant. Let him come so that heeding the people's voice, we  can stop this conflict and usher in freedom of thought and  particular political choices away from the shadow of arms. No  one is avoiding this. I am ready to open a debate about  particular and very modest democratic demands. I am asking you:  Do you have such a counterpart for me?    [OZGUR GUNDEM] They do not respect me, otherwise I would  have come to the talks. I do not know if those higher up would.  But what clear-cut communal and political projects is the PKK  offering for the meaningful, democratic, free, peaceful, and  stable solution of this problem?    [Ocalan] We want to reorganize the historic Turkish-Kurdish  relations. History shows these relations. They began under  Sultan Selcuk and peaked under Sultan Yavuz. They also form the  foundation of the Republic established by Mustafa Kemal. These  relations must be admitted first. We want to surmount the blind  policy of violence, which is against the interests of the  Kurdish people and goes as far as to deny all its national  democratic demands and identity and even annihilates it. The  following are some of the fundamental principles needed to  surmount the current policy: (1) The recognition of  Kurdish-Turkish relations. (2) The suspension of the policy of  violence against and the assimilation of the Kurds, that is, the  erosion of the Kurdish identity. (3) I am saying that alongside  the institutions suitable for each people's national identity,  there is a need to make a transition to a system of federal  parliament and government based on partnership institutions,  that is, to put it more concretely, based on local, or perhaps  federal, parliaments and governments. This is the most concrete  path to a solution that we could advance: the revision of all  relations and the recognition of the need for reorganization,  not under the shadow of arms or pressure, but based on complete  free will. If this is accepted, then there could be an easy  movement toward reorganization within Turkey's existing borders  and based on the genuine free will of the two peoples, which  would forge a stronger fraternity than the current one. This is  possible without too much fighting. I believe in this but I  have no counterpart.    [OZGUR GUNDEM] You spoke against the use of force,  assimilation, and the threat of arms but primarily the General  Staff and an important section of the public accuse you and your  party of using violence and of committing savagery and  massacres. So while you declare your opposition to violence,  your party is being accused of practicing such things. Is there  not a contradiction here?    [Ocalan] Before asking me that, you should have read this  [not further specified; however, Ocalan appears to be referring  to a paper in his hand]. Do I have to read it for you? We  announced the names of those killed during the shelling of  Gabar, Sirnak, and Soke. Their birthplaces were also given.  Some 16 people were listed. We also obtained the names and  dates of birth of the villagers killed in the village of Ziver  in the district of Eruh during the shelling. The number killed  here was 23. Over 50 villagers were killed in shelling on  election day alone. Their names are known. I am not  exaggerating their number. The press did not mention these  facts. So who is committing the savagery? Don't they claim  that children are being killed? Go and check their age. You  should be realistic. When women and children get killed and it  is beyond our control, when angry young people place bombs here  and there, you cannot describe this as PKK tactics. We are  trying to prevent such action. If we do not prevent such action  the streets might turn into a hell. We are very attached to the  principles of humanism and war conventions. It is the General  Staff that is not doing what is needed on this issue.    [OZGUR GUNDEM] When do you hope to see the realization of  your ideal of the "recognition of the Kurds' political,  cultural, and historic rights and of your return to Turkey to  represent your people on a legal platform?"    [Ocalan] I have spent 15 long and important years of my life  in the Middle East, which is a place of contradictions. I have  not done this out of devotion to the place. I have put up with  it out of very difficult but very fundamental historic,  political, and humanistic considerations. It is my ideal to be  engaged in politics amid my people, even in Turkey. I am not  devoted to conducting a policy with the use of arms. I have no  intention of putting my neck out like a sheep if I am given no  alternative but execution. I will defend myself to the end with  whatever means I can find in any corner of the world. It is  obvious that the defense of my own person is linked with the  defense of my own people and party. Why am I doing all these  things? I am doing them so as to engage in politics. I have no  desire for violence for the sake of it. We have political goals  and national and democratic demands and I want to put them into  practice. It is the Turkish regime that does not grasp this.  Let this regime express a bit of goodwill to solve the  problems. Let it assign a counterpart to talks with us. Here  my presence is not a condition. Let those counterparts who  could solve this problem come together. Let us both [PKK and  Turkish Government] support them. What is needed is for both  sides to display goodwill. I reiterate: I am ready to display  my goodwill to the end. But at the same time I will never allow  the suppression, certainly not the denial, of a people's  national democratic demands. If need be I can use ruthless  violence for this purpose or act like the most democratic  politician to fulfill these same duties.</p>

			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: Investors face stern line on settlements - Clients must pay more quickly Even before private investors feel the true impact of the new Crest system for paperless share settlement, they are in for a minor revolution. From July 18, the traditional two-week account settlement period will disappear and all stocks will have to be paid for within 10 business days of the transaction. For sellers, securities will have to be delivered within that time. Earlier this week, the Bank of England conceded that it had been too ambitious with its original timetable to squeeze the settlement period to a mere five days by January 1995. But it says it continues to aim at five-day rolling settlement by the middle of next year at the latest. While the move to rolling settlement will ring in many changes for the private investor - most notably, the need to consider the use of nominee companies and to arrange for extended credit facilities - there are other aspects of business which will need addressing as well. For one thing, the way stockbrokers handle their clients' funds needs an overhaul, according to the Securities and Futures Authority, the self-regulatory body for stockbrokers. At present, stockbrokers 'pool' client funds in between settlement periods, and it is possible to use one client's funds to pay for another's stock. Under the new system, however, stockbrokers will have to segregate each client's account. While the changes in client money rules will produce a far greater burden on brokers than their clients, accountancy firm Touche Ross says there are several things of which clients ought to be aware. 'The big problem is one of client education,' says Paul Leech, senior manager at Touche Ross's securities and banking practice. 'Clients have to be taught to lick the stamp and sign the cheque as soon as they put down the telephone receiver.' Clients now can have from seven to 21 days in which to settle their transactions, and many do not have the sense of immediacy needed to ensure that they or their broker are not out of pocket on a bargain. But there are other problems, according to Mike Jones, head of the settlements committee at the Association of Private Client Stockbrokers and Investment Managers (APCIMS), and technical services director at Capel-Cure Myers Capital Management. For one thing, the latest rule changes do not make clear if a broker whose client has arranged a purchase of stock, but has not paid for it on time, has a 'lien' over that stock. Failure to clarify that issue will discourage brokers from moving swiftly to register stock in their clients' names without cash in hand, says Jones. Alternatively, it could encourage brokers to urge their clients either to use nominee accounts or to put up a 'margin' of their personal assets against which the broker could claim in the event of non-payment. In Australia, which introduced a five-day rolling share settlement system recently, rules allowing the broker to hold on to the stock, and even lend it, have been introduced with great success, Jones adds. These rules allow stock with a value of up to around Pounds 75,000 to be loaned under these circumstances. Jones says the rule has had the effect of giving comfort to brokers and helping to increase liquidity in shares generally.</p>

			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / OECD Ministerial Meeting: Coded criticism directed at US threats THE OECD called yesterday for members to give their strongest support for completion of the long-delayed Uruguay Round of talks on international trade liberalisation, arguing that agreement would play a crucial role in tackling unemployment and poor global economic prospects, writes David Dodwell. In particular, the OECD asked members to 'avoid initiatives and arrangements which undermine the multilateral system' - a coded criticism of the US for its use of bilateral threats to win concessions from trade partners. In a report to OECD ministers on international trade co-operation, the organisation warned against trade blocs which damaged open trade and international competition. It also called for OECD countries to give better trade access to the emergent market economies of east and central Europe, and for harmonisation of trade policy with national strategies on the environment, competition and investment. The report talked of the world trading system 'under strain' with concern over widening trade imbalances, a rising number of trade disputes and increased use of anti-dumping actions and other 'grey area' measures to protect domestic industries. The OECD also presented reports on the two 'post-Uruguay Round' issues causing anxiety - the need to harmonise international trade policies with environmental and competition policies, which have until now been regarded as largely domestic issues. On competition policy, the OECD warned against a number of measures that have aggravated trade tensions. These include: Domestic and export cartels, which are 'often immunised from attack in the exporting country even though they have anti-competitive effects in other jurisdictions.' Vertical links within or between companies which can frustrate the entry or expansion of a foreign company. Grey area measures, like anti-dumping actions and voluntary restraint agreements, which 'can stimulate collusion among domestic and foreign producers,' and restrictive trade measures like rules of origin, government procurement rules or quotas. On the increasingly contentious clash between trade and environmental policies, the OECD has tried to act as a peacemaker. Its report made much of the 'mutual supportiveness' of trade and environment policies. The organisation called for closer international co-operation whenever a trade policy was seen as having potential environmental implications, and an integration of national trade and environmental policy-making at a domestic level. Environmental 'examinations' needed to be developed as quickly as possible. It also argued that countries should settle cross-border environmental disputes multilaterally rather than taking the law into their own hands  - another coded warning that the US administration should resist pressure from local environmental interests to act unilaterally in dealing with international environmental disputes.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Slawomir Matczak, including </F> recorded remarks by Marek Borowski, deputy prime minister and  finance minister; from the "Panorama" program -- relayed by  Warsaw TV Polonia Network]    [Text] [Matczak] The Ministry of Finance has not envisaged  expenditures connected with the Partnership for Peace program in  the budget that has been prepared.    [Borowski] So the question of whether we could afford it has  to be examined closely, and I think that the minister of  national defense should have his say too, or maybe first of all,  as he has a particular budget at his disposal.    [Matczak] All expenses for possible joint military  operations  will be borne by the Ministry of National Defense. The Ministry  of Finance counts, however, on financial support by western  partners for peace as Poland recently suffered considerable  losses, especially in the arms industry. This was connected  with the collapse of the eastern market and with UN embargo.  The partnership can become an important step not in military  cooperation alone.    [Borowski] As the partnership does not give certain  political  guarantees, it may bring some economic benefits.</p>

			<p><P> September 26, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> FOR DISABLED SPECIALIST, SOUND IS NO BARRIER  </P> <P> It happened in a flash as James LeBrecht was leading the way to the booth where  he designed the sound for "Measure for Measure" at the Old Globe Theatre. He  halted his wheelchair before a small flight of steps, jumped out, crawled up,  dragged the wheelchair up behind him and was back in his wheelchair -- all  without breaking pace.  </P> <P> LeBrecht, the 33-year-old resident sound designer for the Berkeley Repertory  Theatre for the last 10 years, may have been born with spina bifida, a spinal  cord defect in which the spine is partly exposed, but he never stops for  obstacles.  </P> <P> "I didn't find out until I was in my mid-teens that I shouldn't have made it as  far as I did," LeBrecht said. "I wasn't supposed to grow up to age 2, and then  4 and then 10. All I knew is that I wasn't walking and I would go to the  doctors a lot."  </P> <P> In the sound booth, with the keyboards and amplifiers all within reach,  LeBrecht is in his element. He trained for this since his days as an  undergraduate at UC San Diego. LeBrecht showed how he used a digital sampling  keyboard to change the pitches of a tape of a howling puppy for "Measure for  Measure." Setting the pitch above the original recording made it sound like sea  gulls. Setting it below made it sound like a wolf howling.  </P> <P> He demonstrated with his hands how he set up a fishing line from which he hung  an old ammo box, a gas cap and metal pipes to provide "a palette of sounds" for  the late John Hirsch when the director came to the Old Globe to do "Coriolanus"  last year.  </P> <P> LeBrecht described his delight at creating one of his favorite moments in sound  design -- the time when, for just an instant, the crickets suddenly stop  chirping in the La Jolla Playhouse production of "War Babies," at the moment  when, unknown to the characters on stage, the nuclear bomb drops far away. The  effect was subtle enough, said LeBrecht, that you sensed something was  different, without being quite sure what you didn't hear.  </P> <P> With 90 professional theater productions to his credit, he stressed, "I am not  a disabled sound designer. I am a sound designer with a disability."  </P> <P> He has managed to not only limit the impact of his disability on his job; he  has, over the years, minimized its effect on his life.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Forced to Adapt  </P> <P> Since he was a child, LeBrecht's parents expected him to adapt to their  split-level house in Westchester. He grew up crawling around the house,  clambering up as many as three flights of stairs with eight or nine steps  apiece. From mid-first grade on, he attended public schools rather than schools  for the disabled. He didn't get his first wheelchair until he was almost ready  for school.  </P> <P> "My parents were not very overprotective, which is the downfall of a lot of  disabled people. In their own way they were preparing me for the real world,"  LeBrecht said.  </P> <P> Not only does LeBrecht live alone in his Berkeley apartment, he does a great  deal of driving in a customized van he uses to go collecting the sounds he  needs for his work. For "Measure for Measure," he drove out near Cuyamaca Lake,  just north of Pine Valley, to tape bird sounds to create the feel of "the walls  of the theater melting away."  </P> <P> His interest in theater began in church, where a family friend, Ed Bryce, who  played Bill Bauer on "The Guiding Light," helped his father put on shows for  the congregation.  </P> <P> By the time LeBrecht was ready for college, he had decided to major in audio.  After his first class, when he realized audio meant studying physics rather  than producing sounds, he switched to a theater major and studied sound design.  </P> <P> He was hired by the Berkeley Repertory Theatre soon after graduation.  </P> <P> Still, as he is the first to admit, it hasn't been easy.  </P> <P> "I had a very rough row to hoe," he said. "And I'm not just talking about  getting a job. I'm talking about getting a date. Or going to the beach."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Overcoming Doubters  </P> <P> LeBrecht has had to work hard to convince others that his disability was not  going to impede his work.  </P> <P> In 1982, Des McAnuff, the artistic director of the La Jolla Playhouse, wanted  LeBrecht to design the sound for his off-Broadway play, "The Death of Von  Richthofen as Witnessed from Earth." Robert Woodruff, the director of the  project, also wanted LeBrecht. But the production manager for the show  presented more of a challenge.  </P> <P> "I had to convince the production manager for 45 minutes on the phone that I  could get up and down steps," LeBrecht recalled. LeBrecht persuaded him and was  hired to create the sounds of flying for McAnuff's story about a WWI flying  ace. He wound up using the sound of a Gatling gun and a lawn mower -- to  suggest the plane's engine -- for the opening scene dogfight.  </P> <P> Another highlight in his career came when he was hired by the Old Globe Theatre  last year to design the sound for "Love's Labour's Lost." Studying at UC San  Diego, he always fantasized about working at the Old Globe. And LeBrecht  couldn't imagine anything more inspiring -- or intimidating -- than working  under the direction of Craig Noel, whom LeBrecht describes as "a legend."  </P> <P> "I really wanted to make good," LeBrecht said. "I feel like I have a  responsibility not to fail. I feel if I do people will say he failed because he  was disabled. You feel there's an added onus when you have a disability.  </P> <P> "When you feel you are really integrated you have the freedom to fail, which  means you have the freedom to stretch yourself and try much harder. We're still  a long way off from that," LeBrecht said.  </P> <P> And yet, despite his words, he is still taking chances.  </P> <P> He recently left his full-time position at the Berkeley Rep to explore  free-lance work in theater and film. His upcoming project at Fantasy Films,  part of the Saul Zaentz Film Center in Berkeley, is "Madhouse," starring  Kirstie Alley of "Cheers." It's a story about a cat who dies and comes back to  life.  </P> <P> Why did he leave what he calls "one of the best sound jobs for theater in the  country"?  </P> <P> He gives the wheel on his wheelchair a playful spin that rolls him from side to  side.  </P> <P> "I just wanted to give it a shot," he said with a grin.  </P></p>

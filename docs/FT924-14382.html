			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Weak currencies rally as rates fears plague equities A ROLLERCOASTER week on financial markets ended yesterday with sterling, the dollar and other weak currencies closing on a stronger note, while new uncertainties plagued equity markets in Europe and the US. Sterling gained more than 2 1/4 pfennigs, closing at DM2.5125 in London and ending the week nearly 15 pfennigs higher than its low-point on Monday, when the currency appeared to be on the verge of a free-fall. It continued to strengthen in New York, where it closed at DM2.52. But while foreign exchanges were calmer after last month's crisis in the European exchange rate mechanism and Monday's turbulence, equities declined in Tokyo, Paris and Frankfurt and on Wall Street. In London, the FT-SE 100 index closed 2.4 higher at 2,541.2, from a peak of 2,566.8, as hopes faded of an early and substantial cut in UK interest rates. Although local issues affected individual centres, changing perceptions of interest rate developments in Germany and the US proved to be a common factor behind the latest fluctuations. There is a growing belief that the Bundesbank will again cut official short-term interest rates because of the need to stimulate growth. At the same time, a report in the Financial Times yesterday said the US Federal Reserve was unlikely to cut its discount rate, currently at 3 per cent, before the presidential election on November 3. That report hit the US bond market, pushing the yield on the US Treasury benchmark 30-year bond above 7.5 per cent. This in turn hit shares, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling 39.45 to 3,136.58. The perception that German rates are about to ease boosted the dollar, sterling and the lira over the week. Yesterday, the dollar closed in London at DM1.4855, nearly 8 pfennigs up on the week, and finished in New York at DM1.488. The lira has firmed even more sharply, closing in London at L874.7, 12 per cent higher than its low point on Monday afternoon. In New York it finished the day at L878.4. Bundesbank reductions in the key rate at which it lends money to commercial banks prompted dealers to believe that a cut in official rates is imminent, with some suggesting it could come at next Thursday's Bundesbank council meeting. There have also been signs of a slowdown in the German economy. The bank has been injecting liquidity into the German money market at a fixed rate of 8.9 per cent, 0.8 points below the level at which it was operating a month ago. Technically, this would allow the Bundesbank to cut its emergency Lombard rate by  1/2 a point without disrupting the structure of market rates. However, Miss Alison Cottrell, an international economics analyst at Midland Montagu in London, said that the bank might wait until the end of the year before cutting official rates. Until yesterday, hopes of lower German rates helped continental European stock markets to claw back most of Monday's falls, when fears about the world economy prompted their biggest losses since the attempted coup in Moscow in August last year. Yesterday, early losses on Wall Street depressed French share prices while in Germany gloom about the economic outlook offset hopes of lower interest rates.

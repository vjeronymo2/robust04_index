			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Hanoi, March 2 (AFP) -- Vietnamese Premier Vo Van  Kiet has ruled out a compromise with the Vatican in a dispute on  the appointments of priests, saying that his government must be  consulted in the selection of clergy, according to an interview  seen here Wednesday.    Kiet told the weekly newspaper Cong Giao va Dan Toc  (Catholicism and the Nation) that the issue was one of "national  sovereignty," as Vietnam had not signed any agreements with the  Vatican allowing them to make unfettered decisions in their  appointments. Each country had the right to ensure stability and  order through its own rules, Kiet said, but adding that he  believed the Vatican "would not create a tense situation and  push the local church to violations of national laws."    After a brief thaw, when Vietnam relaxed some religious  restrictions, relations between Hanoi and the Vatican worsened  in September when authorities in Ho Chi Minh City rejected the  appointment of Bishop Huynh Van Nghi as a "supervisor" of the  church instead of deputy archbishop.    City officials denounced the move as a "Vatican plot" to  install an exiled nephew of former South Vietnamese President  Ngo Dinh Diem as successor to the current archbishop, who is  more than 80 years old and ailing. Vietnamese officials said  they had agreed that Nghi would be named deputy to replace  Archbishop Nguyen Van Binh and accused the Vatican of  manoeuvring to position Diem's nephew Nguyen Van Thuan in the  job. Thuan was appointed deputy archbishop in 1975, but the  communists took power in the then Saigon soon afterwards and  refused to let him take up his post. He left Vietnam for Rome in  1992 and has not been allowed to return.    Kiet praised Archbishop Binh in the interview, saying he had  not failed in his duties to the nation, although "unfortunately,  not all Vietnam's bishops have adopted this positive line." Some  seven million people, or around 10 percent of Vietnam's  population, are Catholic, making it the second largest church  community in Asia after the Philippines.    But the problems between Hanoi and the Vatican have left the  country without a cardinal, as no successor has yet been named  to replace Trinh Van Canh, the archbishop of Hanoi who died in  1990. Hanoi has also been irritated by a Vatican ruling that  priests should not join any political organisations in Vietnam,  including the Solidarity Committee of Patriotic Catholics, which  comes under the Communist Party's Fatherland Front. Vietnam  insists that Catholics belong to the committee but has denied  accusations from the Vatican that it is trying to form a  state-controlled church.</p>

			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses stretch rally to further 1993 highs Another Eurotrack 100 high, and domestic peaks in Frankfurt, Zurich and Madrid testified to the durability of the 1993 European rally, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT's DAX index closed 4.77 higher at a new 1993 peak of 2,182.93. Turnover rose from DM10bn to DM10.2bn. Lufthansa fell DM5 to DM169.50 following newspaper reports that its code-sharing agreement with United Airlines may be blocked by the US government and recovered DM2 to close at DM171.50. Metallgesellschaft fell another DM31.20, or 10.9 per cent to DM255; it said after hours that its new management, headed by Mr Kajo Neukirchen, would concentrate on core activities. Meanwhile, Mr Neukirchen's previous company, Kugelfischer, rose another DM8.50 to DM188 on a broker's recommendation. ZURICH continued its record breaking run, the SMI index adding 9.0 to 2,918.0. In chemicals, Ciba-Geigy bearers rose SFr20 to SFr878 and Roche certificates added SFr5 to SFr6,310, after a day's high of SFr6,350. Nestle, firm in active trade for much of the day, dipped SFr13 to SFr1,247 towards the close on market rumours that it was considering buying a Swedish food company. MILAN rose as fresh indications of falling inflation added to hopes of lower interest rates. The Comit index added 4.42 to 610.43. Montedison eased L9.40 to L870.60, trading ex-rights while its parent, Ferruzzi, added L314 or 17.9 per cent to L2,064, also ex-rights. Both launched capital increases as part of the broad restructuring drawn up by creditor banks to cope with the group's debts. Among blue chips finding renewed foreign demand, Sip rose L93 to L3,535 while Stet was up L84 to L4,220. Fiat added L77 to L4,368 and Olivetti gained L38 to L2,120. Benetton, the clothing manufacturer, advanced L265 to L25,281 in response to its planned rights issue on foreign markets which should bring in at least L150bn. PARIS saw profit-taking, the CAC-40 index closing 7.61 lower at 2,215.86 in brisk turnover of FFr4.47bn. In oils, Elf Aquitaine dropped FFr8.10 to FFr412.90 and Total by FFr3.80 to FFr313. Total said on Monday that lower oil prices would show up as a special inventory write down against profits this year but Mr Jeremy Hudson of Lehman Brothers said that this was expected, and that the sector was probably reacting more to the feeling that a rise in oil prices was less than imminent. Club Med dropped FFr12.90 to FFr335 ahead of a press conference late today. AMSTERDAM shrugged off an unexpected interest rate cut to close slightly lower on profit-taking. The CBS Tendency index eased 0.3 to 145.8. Elsevier added Fl 1.70 to Fl 173.50 on strong foreign demand on the view that the publisher had underperforming its sector. Fokker, the aerospace group, closed unchanged at Fl 21.70 as the market reassessed talks with SAS over possible new aircraft orders. MADRID was led higher by late institutional buying, the general index reaching a new 1993 high of 316.58, up 2.36. Utilities saw profit taking and Sevillana, having made a miniscule cut in dividend in line with official calls for moderation, dropped Pta7 to Pta693. Repsol, on an 11 per cent dividend rise, rose Pta60 to Pta4,380. BRUSSELS saw the Bel-20 index add 10.04 to 1,433.58 on the first day of the new forward market account although some late profit-taking pushed shares off their morning highs. Cockerill was heavily traded after Monday's warrants expiry, rising BFr7 or 4.9 per cent to BFr149 after touching BFr155 during the morning. COPENHAGEN turned higher after its recent declines, and the market is expected to add to the advance today; the central bank announced a 0.25 point cut in the discount rate after the market closed. The KFX index added 0.95 to 101.11. ATHENS saw profit-taking, and lost 1.55 per cent in heavy trading, the general index closing 14.11 lower at 896.83 in turnover estimated at Dr4.7bn. The index has lost about 5 per cent since December 15, when profit-taking began. ISTANBUL hit a third straight high, ending a provisional 193.2, or 1 per cent higher at 19,410.9.

			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Major and Owen reject call to lift Bosnia arms embargo MR JOHN MAJOR, the British prime minister, and Lord Owen, one of the international mediators for a peace agreement in Bosnia, yesterday rejected suggestions that supplying arms to the Moslems would help resolve the year-old conflict there. Mr Major, answering a parliamentary question, said the weapons flow to all sides should be cut off rather than increased. The US has said that a partial lifting of the UN arms ban to help the Moslems defend themselves against Serb attacks was under consideration to put pressure on the Bosnian Serbs to sign the peace plan drawn up by Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen. The public endorsement of such a step earlier this week by the former British prime minister, Lady Thatcher, has provoked a passionate political debate in Britain about the need for the international community to take more decisive action to stop Serb aggression in Bosnia. 'The whole European Community takes the view that lifting the arms embargo is not the right priority at this stage and that the fundamental thing is tightening sanctions' against the rump Yugoslav federation of Serbia and Montenegro, Lord Owen said in a BBC radio interview. Speaking after talks in London with Mr Reginald Bartholomew, the US special envoy to the peace talks, Lord Owen said the danger of arming the Moslems was that it would unleash a sophisticated arms race, with the Russians supplying Serbia and Montenegro. Mr Cedric Thornberry, deputy chief of the UN Protection Force mission in Zagreb, also said the lifting of the arms embargo was 'not a very practical or useful idea. If you put more arms into Bosnia, you get more war.' The international mediators have always believed Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic can play a key role in persuading the Bosnian Serbs to accept the plan, which only the Bosnian Croats and Moslems have signed. At a 40-minute meeting later yesterday with Mr Douglas Hogg, a British Foreign Office minister, Mr Bartholomew was understood to have accepted that a decision to lift sanctions would inevitably increase the fighting in Bosnia and might well result in the suspension of the humanitarian relief operations. He also conceded that it would be very difficult to get the Russians to approve a UN Security Council resolution to implement such a step. But the US envoy assured Mr Hogg that the lifting of sanctions was not an immediate issue and would only be considered if tighter sanctions failed to work. Mr Bartholomew, who later had talks with Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, and Mr Hogg agreed that everything possible should be done to ensure that a resolution to tighten economic sanctions against Serbia should be pushed through the Security Council later this month, if the Bosnian Serbs had still not signed the Vance-Owen plan by then. Laura Silber adds from Belgrade: In Srebrenica, the besieged Moslem enclave in eastern Bosnia, local authorities refused to allow the evacuation of refugees unless the UN provided helicopters for some 500 wounded. A spokeswoman for the UN High Commissioner of Refugees said a relief convoy was allowed to evacuate only five elderly women. Meanwhile, Serb forces tightened their stranglehold on the town and were reported to be within range of small arms fire. Elsewhere, Bosnia's Croat forces sealed off key towns in Bosnia-Hercegovina with the aim of forcing Moslem troops to withdraw from provinces designated for Croat control under the Vance-Owen plan.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Yi Tae-kun from the "Reporter's Memo" column: </F> "Seoul Metropolitan City Government's Administration Affected by  North Korea's nuclear issue"]    [Text] The Seoul Metropolitan City government is agonizing  over "the issue of inspections of North Korea's nuclear  facilities." At a glance, there is no seemingly understandable  relationship between "Seoul City government and North Korea's  nuclear development" at all. This notwithstanding, there is an  understandable story in this relationship, because there is a  delicate functional relation in which the Seoul City government  might suffer from not a little monetary loss, depending upon  where the direction of North Korea's nuclear issue goes.    The Yankee Bonds (bonds issued in U.S. dollars by the U.S.  stock market), which the Seoul City government was thinking  about issuing this month, are linked to North Korea's nuclear  issue.    The Seoul City government had planned to issue Yankee Bonds  worth $300 million (240 billion won) with a view to  investing--the funds raised by these bonds--in the equipment to  be used for some sections of the second-phase construction of  the Seoul Metropolitan Area subway system. The construction  will be completed at the end of this year. Yankee Bonds, with  interest rates of as low as 6 to 8 percent, provide better loan  terms than any other domestic stocks because they are long-term  bonds with a maturity of 10 years.    But, a problem has arisen. Tension between North Korea and  the United States and between South and North Korea has been  mounting to the highest point over the last few days. As a  result, voices calling for "warning against the North" and  "imposing economic sanctions against the North" have been heard.  If such a situation is not removed, the Korean peninsula will  be viewed by American investors as an unstable area, and a risk  will be added, so that interest rates will drastically increase.    In fact, the interest rate, which has been regarded as  acceptable only if it increases to 7 to 8 percent, is predicted  to increase to over 9 percent--far exceeding the expected  rate--as a result of the recent worsening situation surrounding  North Korea's nuclear development.    This is not the only problem. The fact is that American  institutional investors might not buy the bonds issued by the  Seoul City government at all. If Seoul City's Yankee Bonds are  issued and there are no buyers--which would be a very rare  occurrence--it will be a disgrace to our country, let alone the  Seoul City government.    Under these circumstances, the Ministry of Finance has given  a guideline "of stressing the need to reconsider the timing of  issuance of Yankee Bonds" to the Seoul City government, saying  that "the situation surrounding North Korea's nuclear issue is  ominous." Because of this, the Seoul City government has for the  moment canceled its plan to issue Yankee Bonds during this  month. But, officials concerned at the Seoul City government  wear tearful faces, saying: "How can we now raise money for the  construction of the subway for the latter half of this year?"</p>

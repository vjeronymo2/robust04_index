			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / Vietnamese strike at Korean-owned plant: Higher wages demand and alleged attack on worker prompt discord More than 300 workers at a South Korean-owned textile mill in Vietnam struck yesterday in a dispute over wages and an alleged attack by a South Korean employee on a Vietnamese worker, AP reports from Hanoi. The strike began on Saturday at the Pang Rim Vietnam Company in Viet Tri City, about 40km north west of Hanoi, and highlights the tension between managers and workers at some foreign ventures. The country has become a favoured investment home for companies seeking a low-wage production site. Pang Rim Vietnam is wholly owned by Pang Rim, South Korea's third-largest textile maker. Mr IC Kim, head of the factory's import-export division, said by telephone that the two sides had agreed to a wage increase and that the strikers were expected to report for work tomorrow. He said the strike did not entirely shut down operations, as 1,300 other workers remained on the job. The strike reflects growing assertiveness among Vietnamese workers, especially since a labour law was passed last summer explicitly protecting the right to strike. The official newspaper Lao Dong said last month that 32 strikes had occurred in the country from January through October. The strike also reflects tensions between foreign bosses and Vietnamese workers accustomed to very different work styles. Workers at another South Korean company walked out last year after a similar allegation was made that a South Korean supervisor had struck a Vietnamese worker. Mr Pham Dinh Chien, president of the textile mill's trade union, said the Pang Rim strike was triggered when a foreman beat a worker he thought had left work early. Mr Kim denied that any beating took place. A Vietnamese worker who answered the telephone at a factory office described the incident as a fight between a worker and a South Korean technician who had demanded to see the worker's pass. Vietnamese government officials rushed to the plant on Monday to mediate in the conflict. The two sides agreed the same day on a settlement including wage increases of 5 to 10 per cent, but the strikers failed to show up for work yesterday.</p>

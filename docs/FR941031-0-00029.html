The State is currently drafting its conformity rule to comply with USEPA's conformity rule. Therefore, any major federally funded and State funded projects in the areas redesignated to attainment by this action will be addressed through State conformity analyses and will be subject to the emissions budget established by the applicable maintenance plan. The Indianapolis-Evansville highway and any major modifications in public transportation will be subject to conformity analyses after Marion County is redesignated to attainment. If the changes to the public transportation system are minor, they are not required to be subject to conformity analyses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Comment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A commenter has noted that the State has not shown that the improvements in air quality (occurring after the violation period of 1987 through 1989) are due to permanent and enforceable emission reductions as required in section 107(d)(3)(E)(iii) of the Act. The commenter argues that the September 4, 1992 USEPA redesignation policy guidance is clear in requiring analysis of whether the improved air quality has resulted in part from either unique meteorological conditions or adverse economic conditions. Air quality improvements due to these air quality impacts are not permanent, and, therefore, are not creditable. These aspects have been neglected in both the State redesignation request and in USEPA's subsequent rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> USEPA Response  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The September 4, 1992 USEPA policy guidance referred to by the commenter states that ``[a]ttainment resulting from temporary reductions in emission rates (e.g., reduced production or shutdown due to temporary adverse economic conditions) or unusually favorable meteorology would not qualify as an air quality improvement due to permanent and enforceable emission reductions.'' Neither the State nor the USEPA has neglected these issues in preparing and analyzing Indiana's redesignation request. Rather, the USEPA believes that the State has adequately demonstrated that the improvement in air quality resulting in the attainment of the ozone standard is not due to temporary economic downturn or unusually favorable meteorology. As explained below, the State has made an adequate demonstration that the improvement in air quality in these Counties leading to attainment of the ozone standard was not due to temporary reductions in emission rates or to unusually favorable meteorology.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to the issue of temporary emission reductions due to economic downturn, the USEPA noted in the July 8, 1994 direct final rulemaking (59 FR 35048), that the State has shown that attainment of the ozone standard is attributable to permanent and enforceable emission reductions that have occurred in Elkhart, Marion, and St. Joseph Counties. These emission reductions have resulted from source closures, implementation of emission controls on stationary sources (this included added emission reductions resulting from the correction of reasonably available control technology regulations in response to regulation deficiencies previously noted by the USEPA), implementation of the federal motor vehicle emission control program, and implementation of gasoline reid vapor pressure restrictions (Indiana implemented USEPA reid vapor pressure requirements, lowering reid vapor pressure limits to 9.0 pounds per square inch by 1992). All of these controls are permanent and enforceable. In the case of source closures, the source permits associated with these sources have been terminated and will not be reissued. Substantial emission reductions have occurred as a result of the imposition of permanent and enforceable emission controls, and it is USEPA's judgment that these reductions, rather than reductions attributable to any temporary economic downturn, are primarily responsible for the improvement in air quality that led to the attainment of the ozone standard in these Counties. The continued attainment status of these Counties in the years since the 1990&hyph;1992 period further indicates that temporary adverse economic conditions in the 1990&hyph;1991 period were not a significant factor in the attainment of the ozone standard in these Counties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> April 18, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KINGS BATTLE OILERS, 23 YEARS OF HISTORY;  </P> <P> HOCKEY: EDMONTON HAS OVERCOME A 3-1 DEFICIT TO REACH THE SMYTHE DIVISION FINAL  SERIES AGAINST L.A., WHICH HAS NEVER PLAYED LONGER THAN THE SECOND ROUND.  </P> <P> The final image from Game 6 Saturday night at the Forum remains indelible.  </P> <P> Calgary Flame goalie Mike Vernon is on his knees, stretching like an outfielder  going for a fly ball. Just beyond his straining fingertips sails the puck,  moving seemingly in slow motion.  </P> <P> With it sails the prospect of keeping the Stanley Cup, won a year ago, but just  out of the grasp of Vernon and his teammates. The puck, hit by the Kings' Mike  Krushelnyski, lands in the net to end the series.  </P> <P> It's an image the Flames won't soon forget.  </P> <P> But it's an image that weighs heavily on the minds of the Kings, too, as they  prepare for Game 1 of the Smythe Division finals tonight against the Edmonton  Oilers at the Northlands Coliseum.  </P> <P> This is the 23rd season of existence for the Kings. It is their 15th appearance  in the playoffs.  </P> <P> And they have never advanced beyond the second round. Good teams and bad,  Stanley Cup after Stanley Cup has eluded their grasp. It is no problem feeling  for Vernon.  </P> <P> Those not into ancient history need only remember a year ago to appreciate the  frustration the Kings have endured.  </P> <P> The team was flying high. It was Wayne Gretzky's first season in Los Angeles  and the Kings had just bumped off Edmonton, then the defending Stanley Cup  champion, in seven games. To add to the exhilaration, the Kings had done so by  coming back from a 3-1 deficit, becoming only the sixth team in NHL history to  do so.  </P> <P> Enter Calgary in the second round.  </P> <P> Exit the Kings, in four games.  </P> <P> Now, the roles are reversed. This time, the Flames were the defending champions  knocked off by the Kings.  </P> <P> And this time, Edmonton has come back from a 3-1 deficit to survive the first  round, beating the Winnipeg Jets in a seventh game Monday night.  </P> <P> "It's a lot different this time," Gretzky said. "We are so much stronger this  year.  </P> <P> "Last year, it (the playoff against Edmonton) was such an emotional series.  Then, we were horrendous (against Calgary) and it was over before we knew it."  </P> <P> Mark Messier, Gretzky's Oiler counterpart and the man considered the favorite  for the Hart Trophy as NHL most valuable player, doesn't want to dwell on last  season, either. Particularly, his team's collapse against the Kings.  </P> <P> "I don't think what happened is going to enter into it this time," he said.  "That's all behind us. We're not looking at that. That's like when you rip your  rear-view mirror on your car. What's behind you isn't important."  </P> <P> Unless you can use it as a motivator. Edmonton Coach John Muckler isn't  hesitant to bring up Gretzky, who led the Oilers to four Stanley Cups before  coming to the Kings two seasons ago.  </P> <P> "A lot of people remember the joy Wayne got from beating us (last season),"  Muckler said, "and it was joy. I don't blame him, but he's an opponent now and  has to be treated as such. Wayne will do everything in his power to win and we  should, too."  </P> <P> Messier, on the other hand, would prefer to leave Gretzky in the past.  </P> <P> "All the emotional ties are gone," he said. "This is a brand new club. Wayne  hasn't entered into our talks once all year.  </P> <P> "We have to contend with Wayne obviously because he's such a great player, but  it's not us against him. It's the Oilers versus the Kings. That's the truth."  </P> <P> If the emotion from last year has truly dissipated, how about the emotion  generated the last time these teams met in the regular season? The result was  an NHL-record 86 penalties in a confrontation that was more a brawl than a  game.  </P> <P> The Kings' Tomas Sandstrom wound up with a facial fracture and a scratched  cornea as a result of a punch thrown by Glenn Anderson.  </P> <P> "They were coming off a bad loss to Calgary," King Coach Tom Webster said, "and  we were trying to establish ourselves as a team. We both clashed at the wrong  time.  </P> <P> "We played with great discipline against Calgary in the playoffs, and we now  have to do the same thing against Edmonton."  </P> <P> The Kings got bad news from doctors Tuesday.  </P> <P> Defenseman Tom Laidlaw, out since March 17 with a lower back injury, may be  through for the season.  </P> <P> And veteran right wing Dave Taylor, who suffered a strained shoulder in Game 6  of the Calgary series, may not be back for the Edmonton series.  </P> <P> There was good news. Defenseman Tim Watters, out since Game 4 against the  Flames with a deep ankle bruise, may be back by Game 3 of this series.  </P> <P> And left wing John Tonelli, who bruised his knee in Game 6, skated Tuesday and  is expected to play tonight.  </P> <P> Taking Taylor's spot on the line with Luc Robitaille and Todd Elik will be  Scott Bjugstad, finishing his first season with the Kings.  </P> <P> For Edmonton, goalie Grant Fuhr is out for the year with an injured shoulder,  but backup Bill Ranford played well in the Jet series, stopping 26 shots in  Monday's 4-1 victory to finish the series with a 2.81 goals-against average.  </P> <P> Oiler center Craig MacTavish has a hip injury, but is expected to play.  </P> <P> King Notes  </P> <P> The Oilers were 4-2-2 against the Kings in the regular season, 2-1-1 both home  and away. . . . Game 2 will be at Northlands Coliseum Friday, with the scene  switching to the Forum for Games 3 (Sunday) and 4 (Tuesday). If necessary,  Games Five and Seven would be back in Edmonton April 26 and 30. Game Six would  be at the Forum April 28.  </P></p>

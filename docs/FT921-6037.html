			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Please wake me when it's over - London Markets YOU KNOW those mornings when you wake up and you just want the world to go away? Well, Royal Insurance knows all about that - and this week it announced that it had found a temporary fix. It has hedged 'a chunky proportion' of one of its UK share portfolios against the risk of a sharp decline, for example during the election period. So for those responsible for this part of the Royal's equity portfolio, the world has suddenly become a place where only good news matters. For the rest of us, alas, the good and bad come mixed together. And among this week's bad news was Thursday's announcement from - surprise] - Royal Insurance that it was passing its final dividend because it had made pre-tax losses of Pounds 373m in 1991. The share price dropped 16 per cent on Thursday to 190p. It dropped further on Friday, to close at 183p, down 36p on the week. Royal's terrible results lie behind its decision to hedge last autumn. The balance sheet of its UK general insurance operations (known as Royal UK) has been badly weakened by losses, particularly on policies that insure building societies against defaulting mortgage-holders. 'When one's balance sheet is at these levels, one has to say 'what sort of risks are there that could make the position worse?'' says David Barker, managing director of Royal Insurance Asset Management. One obvious risk is a drop in the stock market, which could affect the value of the Pounds 400m or so in Royal UK's equity portfolio. This is roughly a sixth of Royal UK's portfolio - the rest is in cash, short-term fixed-interest securities or property. 'We took the view that if there was a risk that a significant bear market would do further damage to the balance sheet, we should explore ways of protecting ourselves,' says Barker. The way they came up with was to buy a 'contract of differences' with some unspecified counterparty, presumably another financial institution. 'Below a certain figure on the FT-SE,' says Barker, 'they have to pay us money for every point of difference on the FT-SE scale.' Royal paid an upfront premium for this contract in the autumn, says Barker, 'when FT-SE was higher than it is today.' FT-SE reached its highest point in September, when it touched 2667.4. The contract can be traded, and its value therefore goes up whenever FT-SE moves closer to the magic figure. So Barker must have had a cheerful December, when the index dropped to a recent low of 2345.4. It closed on Friday at 2562.1, a gain of 19.8 on the week. Barker fully expects the contract to expire worthless, sometime after the election, since his view is that the stock market will be appreciably higher towards the end of the year than it is today. The contract should be regarded as 'investment reinsurance', he says: 'The chances are we won't get anything, but that doesn't stop you insuring your car.' So they paid their money and slept more peacefully at night. Others enjoying more restful sleep this week were the directors of Midland Bank, who avoided the dire fate, widely predicted in the City, of passing their final dividend. Midland managed to pay the same (reduced) final dividend as in the year before. Its share price rose 21p to 260p. Dividends were also the subject of much boardroom discussion at Barclays Bank, where the directors seriously considered cutting the final payout. In the event, they ate into reserves, and held the dividend. One encouraging sign was that in the second half of the year, Midland's bad debt charge fell. So did Barclays', but by a proportionately smaller amount. Barclays' share price ended Friday at 361p, down 27p on the week. Since the stock market peaked in September, Barclays has underperformed the FT-Actuaries All-Share index by 19 per cent; Midland has outperformed it by 7 per cent. Results of other big companies reporting this week came in more or less in line with expectations. Before the results season started Warburg Securities had expected the 22 big companies that have so far reported to show full-year pre-tax profit declines of 8 per cent, on average, and that's exactly the figure that they came in at. Nothing to disturb the sleep of the unhedged investor there. Anyone who owns shares in Lonrho is probably used to the odd disturbed night, since the shares have halved in value in four months. This week's insomnia offering was the discovery that behind the group's poor preliminary results lay some even less encouraging annual report details: profits, already down sharply, would have been lower still without the Pounds 33m gained from disposals of property and the Pounds 27m of capitalised interest. The shares closed the week at 117p, down 12 1/2 p. Results aside, the main influence on nocturnal activity these days is the electoral outlook. The Greek chorus of political pundits, after awarding the first round of this potential seven-round bout, in January, to the Conservatives, marked the February round to Labour. The stock market appeared to regard the slight adjustment of the odds with equanimity; the economic risks of a possible giveaway Budget were apparently offset by the political advantages it might offer to the Conservatives. The Bank of England signalled several times during the week that an interest rate cut was unlikely before the Budget, now ten days away. The money market appeared confident that it would come promptly then, however. All in all, a week that could have offered plenty of reasons for staying in bed, had passed without too much bad news. Most individual investors - lacking the Royal's technical expertise in hedging, or its pressing need to do so - will be happy for the rest of the results season and the electoral campaign to go the same way.</p>

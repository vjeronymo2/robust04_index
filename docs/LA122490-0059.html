			<p><P> December 24, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SYNDROME'S EXISTENCE DOUBTED  </P> <P> A new study has raised new questions about the existence of a mysterious  syndrome that some doctors have linked to repeated yeast infections,  researchers said last week. In the study, the widely used anti-fungal drug  nystatin was no more effective than a dummy drug in relieving symptoms such as  fatigue, premenstrual tension, gastrointestinal problems and depression in 42  women with a history of vaginal yeast infections.  </P> <P> "I think these data cast further doubt on the existence of the syndrome," which  is variously known as chronic candiasis, candida-related complex and candiasis  hypersensitivity syndrome, said Dr. William Dismukes of the University of  Alabama Medical Center in Birmingham.  </P> <P> Yeast infections are caused by the fungus Candida albicans, which is commonly  found in the intestinal tract and the vagina. Usually, it does not create  problems. But if factors such as use of antibiotics or pregnancy allow the  fungus to grow rapidly, it can cause vaginal infections in women.  </P> <P> Some researchers believe that chronic candiasis not only causes vaginal  irritation and discharge but a host of other symptoms as well. However, in the  study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, Dismukes and  co-researchers concluded that their results "provide additional objective  evidence that the syndrome is not a verifiable condition."  </P></p>

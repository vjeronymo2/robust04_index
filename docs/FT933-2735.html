			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / DTI launches trade group to improve UK educational exports THE Department of Trade and Industry yesterday launched a trade group to improve UK educational exports. The aim is to improve the marketing of British further and higher education to foreigners - which already contributes some Pounds 1.5bn annually to the economy - and to strengthen markets for government training schemes. Baroness Perry, who recently retired as vice-chancellor of South Bank University, will lead the department's new education and training group. Her priority will be to improve British competitiveness in bidding for training contracts in developing countries which are funded by the World Bank and usually awarded by national governments. She said the UK lags behind Germany and the US.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] On the eve of the census in The Former Yugoslav  Republic of Macedonia [FYROM], representatives of various  political parties and other associations have put forward their  statements. Regarding the census, Mendu Thaci, deputy chairman  of the Party for Democratic Prosperity Party [PDP], declared to  the Albanian Radio and Television:    [Thaci] The public has been informed that in 1991, the  Albanians boycotted the census held at that time. This was an  expression of civil disobedience on the part of Albanians,  practically the lack of belief toward the administration staff.    The Law on Census, which was approved some time ago by the  parliament of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, is in  fact more respectful of minorities than that of 1991, but when  attaching to it the bad will of the administration staff that  applies this law, this means that Albanians will be  discriminated from the beginning at this level.    Article 24 of this law states that nationalities here should  be represented on the basis of a proportional number. In fact,  this law is not respected, because according to the official  data in 1991, Albanians were 21 percent and more, while now in  the census commissions and registration groups, Albanians in  this republic take part with 12.8 percent.    It is known that the Macedonian administration staff  particularly creates a terrible confusion with documentation,  especially in ensuring the nationality of this republic. At the  present level, there are more than 60 percent of Albanians who  have not arranged the problem of nationality. Moreover,  something that was not in 1991 is included, which is the fact  that all the Albanians who work abroad will be considered as a  non-resident population and will not be counted. The census is  really a very important act, but I would say that it is not an  historic act.    The PDP does not bear responsibility for the failure of this  census, because it is not this party that participated in  drafting the law, various consultations in commissions, and  lately it is not the one that voted for the law in the  parliament of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. The  responsibility falls on those who make manipulations and such  non-serious projects.</p>

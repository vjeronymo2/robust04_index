			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / Algeria unveils austerity proposals ALGERIA'S new government promised austerity and more taxes but offered incentives to foreign investors in an ambitious plan to achieve a market economy and end violence, Reuter reports from Algiers. It warned 'rigorous austerity, drastically reducing the need to import' was coming. The rich will be taxed more on income, with a separate tax on assets; tax breaks will go to innovative companies replacing imported goods, and competing imports will be banned. A 'vast field of activities' will open for local and foreign investors with incentives, including favourable exchange rates for investment.</p>

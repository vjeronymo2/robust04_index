			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / International Company News: Setback for Indonesian flotation BARITO Pacific Timber's planned Dollars 250m flotation suffered a setback yesterday when Salomon Brothers, the US merchant bank, withdrew as lead foreign underwriter. Barito, Indonesia's largest integrated timber producer, accounts for 16 per cent of the world plywood market. Gross profits last year totalled Rp230m (Dollars 113m) on sales of Rp769m. The flotation, consisting of 10 per cent of the company, is expected to value Barito Pacific Timber at about Dollars 2.5bn. Salomon Bros would not comment, but one banker said the decision resulted from Barito's failure to provide information which 'a reasonable investor would expect to see in the prospectus'. An official close to Barito said Indonesian regulations limiting corporate disclosure may have resulted in Salomon having insufficient information to satisfy US regulatory authorities. Brokers said the flotation would proceed, although Makindo Securities, the Indonesian broking house lead-managing the issue, may find it harder to attract foreign investors. Crosby Securities, which specialises in Asian markets, and Schroders, the UK investment bank, were still supporting the flotation, brokers said. Several broking houses, including Wardley James Capel, have published 'subscribe' notes to clients. The issue has been dogged by bad publicity since it was formally announced two weeks ago.</p>

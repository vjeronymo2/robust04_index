			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Survey of Hertfordshire (5): Sites identified for overseas arrivals - Property / Office rents have dived by as much as 40 per cent THE LATE 1980s property boom, which outside London centred on the M4 corridor, rippled north-east into Hertfordshire. Jeremy Needs, a director of Hitchin-based developer Hunting Gate, aptly sums up what happened in the property market: 'Hertfordshire caught the Heathrow disease.' The result is that the Hertfordshire Development Organisation (HDO), the body set up under the county's Partnership for Prosperity programme last September, estimates that there is now some 15m square metres of vacant office and other commercial space within the area. Office rents throughout the county have plunged by as much as 40 per cent, according to surveyors, Weatherall Green &amp; Smith. Landlords are not only having to slash rents (if, indeed, official quoting rents still apply in this market), but also to offer incentive packages. These include rent-free periods, contributions towards fitting out and even, in some cases, taking on a tenant's existing lease commitments. By general consensus, the best rent in Hertfordshire was achieved in the 1988-9 relocation to Watford of Rhone-Poulenc, which took 53,000 square feet in Kumagai Gumi/Ranelagh's Central Park at marginally over Pounds 30 a sq ft. In contrast, today Legal &amp; General Property and Hunting Gate are seeking Pounds 22 a sq ft for their high specification 78,000 sq ft Edward Hyde office development in Clarendon Road, Watford. It has been completed and empty for 18 months. The HDO, however, is drawing up a marketing plan that will spread the net much wider, targeting inward investment from overseas companies. It is likely that incoming companies will require business park-type accommodation; and, to ensure that there will be a good choice of locations, the HDO has identified five strategic sites in the county, all currently at different stages of development. Most advanced is Markheath's Kings Park, a 22-acre site adjoining the railway station at Stevenage. With space for 600,000 sq ft of business space, the site is already landscaped, with infrastructure in place - and the developer is willing to begin immediate construction for an occupier. The other sites are at Cherry Tree Lane, Hemel Hempstead; the Rolls Royce site at Leavesden, near Watford; Essex Road, Hoddesden; and the British Aerospace site at Hatfield. The 57-acre Cherry Tree Lane site, at Junction 8 on the M1, is owned partly by the Commission for the New Towns and partly by the Crown Estate. Mainly green-field, it has been earmarked by the planners for business and industrial development. However, its availability will depend on the provision of a new access road. Construction of a bridge over a railway is needed, to facilitate development at Essex Road, Hoddesden. This 30-acre site, designated for general industrial and warehousing, is owned by Powergen, Redland and the Department of Transport. Rolls-Royce is to vacate the 60-acre Leavesden site at the end of June, and development will be for mixed use: offices and R&amp;D. These first four sites are, however, dwarfed by the British Aerospace site at Hatfield, where there is potential for some 200 acres of development. British Aerospace property subsidiary Arlington is busy at the 92-acre former BAe Dynamics site, which has planning consent for 960,000 sq ft of mixed uses - offices, light industrial, general industrial and warehousing. Already a 78,000 sq ft depot for Royal Mail's Streamline Parcels has been completed on a design-and-build basis. In addition, BAe's purpose-built conference centre - which was never used - has been sold to the University of Hertfordshire. Work is under way on the simultaneous demolition of buildings and provision of new infrastructure, both scheduled for completion in November. A further 100 acres will become available with the closure of BAe's Comet Way jets area. Giles Thomas, of agents Strutt &amp; Parker, says Arlington is looking at the planning implications, and also at short-term alternative uses. He says there are signs of further interest from potential occupiers, with three serious proposals before prospective tenants. Although the Hatfield Business Park seems set to become Hertfordshire's largest, Hunting Gate and Allied Dunbar's 55-acre Shire park at Welwyn Garden City must rank as one of the most successful so far. A total of 400,000 sq ft is now built and occupied by companies, including ICI, Digital, Nexus and Aircall. In addition, Warren Spring laboratory, the government's principal environmental technology laboratory, has taken a 10-acre site. Its new facility is due for completion in spring 1995. A further 125,000 sq ft in four buildings is available in a second phase at Shire Park; and joint agents, Gooch &amp; Wagstaff and Jones Lang Wootton, are indicating rents of around Pounds 23 a sq ft. Little industrial property development is currently being undertaken in Hertfordshire, although the level of industrial oversupply is far lower than that of offices. One of the largest current industrial/warehouse developments is Burton Property Trust and IBM Pension Fund's City Park, at Welwyn Garden City, where only three units remain. More recent occupiers at the 230,000 sq ft project include Haking International (UK), the world's largest manufacturer of cameras and binoculars, which bought a 22,000 sq ft unit for Pounds 2.1m, and Parcel Force which took a lease on a 27,000 sq ft unit. The Hatfield Galleria, put up by Carroll Group subsidiary A1 Galleria Investment Corporation, was one of the most spectacular retail casualties in the recession. Now in receivership, the future of the 400,000 sq ft shopping centre is unclear, though it continues to trade. Besides the dramatic construction cost over-run, another of Galleria's problems was a restrictive user clause, effectively preventing the centre from competing with the fashion draw of Slough Estates' much more successful 216,000 sq ft Howard Centre, at Welwyn Garden City. The two centres fall within the same borough, and Slough successfully sued the local authority for failing to enforce the user clause at the Galleria. The only other major shopping centre to open in Hertfordshire during the past two years - again in the south of the county - was Capital &amp; Counties/Sun Alliance/Watford Borough Council's Harlequin Centre, Watford. At 700,000 sq ft, it is one of the biggest in the UK. The last of the three phases of the Pounds 100m project was completed last summer, and this 200,000 sq ft section has attracted a flurry of lettings to fashion retailers, including River Island, Hennes, Stirling Cooper and Miss Selfridge. The almost-completed M1 link road, which gives the centre direct access to the motorway network, will upgrade its status, the developers hope, to that of a regional shopping centre.</p>

			<p><P> March 28, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 15-CARRIER U.S. NAVY  </P> <P> Trost's column clearly articulates this nation's dependence on naval forces to  fulfill our national security interests. Unfortunately, in his effort to tout  the necessity for 15 carriers, the admiral omitted any reference to the  contribution the amphibious forces make to a naval campaign.  </P> <P> Conspicuously absent is any mention that an Amphibious Task Force (made up of  Navy and Marine Corps forces) provides a credible forcible entry capability to  project power ashore. This "Gator Navy" can and often does operate with the  carrier battle group. It is doubtful that the carrier battle group alone can "  . . . Take complete control of an area" without amphibious forces.  </P> <P> PAUL F. PUGH  </P> <P> Stafford, Va.  </P></p>

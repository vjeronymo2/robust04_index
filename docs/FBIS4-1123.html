			<p>BFN     [Text] Government chief negotiator Roelf Meyer said it is  too late for the Conservative Party [CP] to participate in the  elections. He addressed students at the University of  Stellenbosch today.    [Begin recording] [Correspondent Ronel van Zyl] Meyer said  that CP leader Ferdi Hartzenberg could participate under the  umbrella of the Freedom Front.    [Meyer] The reasons or conditions which he advances for  participation are not practical. He said 800,000 votes must see  to it that there is a volkstaat. There is no way that we will  yield to that sort of condition for a volkstaat. The issue will  have to be negotiated further.    [Van Zyl] In his speech to the students, Meyer castigated  the  Inkatha Freedom Party for its decision to join the elections at  the last moment.    [Meyer] The decision by Inkatha to participate in fact came  at a time when Inkatha realized that the election was not going  to be postponed.    [Van Zyl] Meyer said he believed the election will be  reasonably free and fair. He was optimistic about the new South  Africa, and added that white South Africans should not feel  uneasy, but should rather look forward to the future with  anticipation and excitement. [end recording]    The ANC in its reaction rejected Dr. Hartzenberg's proposal  that the principle of a volkstaat must be accepted if the right  wing can attract 800,000 votes in the election. This  organization's chief negotiator said at a news conference in  Johannesburg that the interim constitution was already making  provision for a volkstaat that will be able to make  recommendations to the constituent assembly.    [Ramaphosa, in English] We do not believe that the proposal  that has been put forward by Ferdi Hartzenberg is a proposal  that we should take seriously. If Ferdi Hartzenberg wants to  participate in the election, he is free to do so, and we would  encourage him to be part of Constand Viljoen's Freedom Front.  They should contest elections under that name, and we will meet  them in Parliament. We will then be able to discuss the idea of  a volkstaat more effectively. [end recording]</p>

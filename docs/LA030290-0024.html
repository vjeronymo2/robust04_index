			<p><P> March 2, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> EL CAMINO PROVES STRONG  </P> <P> It's clear after two rounds of regional playoffs that 23rd-seeded El Camino is  the strongest basketball team from the five-member South Coast Conference. The  Warriors weren't seeded accordingly, but they've proven their strength by  upsetting two higher-seeded teams on the road -- No. 10 Santa Monica and No. 7  L.A. City College.  </P> <P> All other SCC teams, though seeded above El Camino, have been eliminated from  the playoffs. No. 16 Long Beach fell to No. 17 Riverside in the first round and  No. 21 Pasadena lost to No. 12 Golden West on the same day. On Wednesday, SCC  champion Cerritos, seeded sixth, was upset by No. 11 Glendale.  </P> <P> The Warriors have survived two tough rounds, but their biggest test will be  Saturday when they go to No. 2 Cypress (27-3) for the bracket final. A victory  against the Orange Empire League champs means a spot March 8-10 in the final  eight tournament at UC Irvine's Bren Events Center.  </P> <P> El Camino (22-10) will have to play impeccable basketball to obtain its third  consecutive playoff upset. Cypress, whose coach, Don Johnson, has a 500-208  record in 23 years at the school, nailed the Warriors 70-49 on Dec. 23. IRENE  GARCIA  </P></p>

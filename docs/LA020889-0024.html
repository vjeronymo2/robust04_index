			<p><P> February 8, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BALLET REVIEW;  </P> <P> KUDELKA'S NEW 'COMFORT ZONE'  </P> <P> James Kudelka's important new work for San Francisco Ballet, "The Comfort  Zone," is like an Olympic relay race, with the flame of the ballet -- its  remarkable energy and invention -- held high while passed from team to team on  stage at the War Memorial Opera House.  </P> <P> This sense of a shared trajectory and destination, with a community of dancers  making collaborative contributions en route, also shaped Kudelka's recent  "Concerto Grosso" for the Joffrey Ballet and "Dreams of Harmony," his  large-scale San Francisco Ballet success of 1987. Once again, Kudelka has found  a dynamic paradigm for an ideal society and also made a statement about the  continuity of classical dancing.  </P> <P> In "The Comfort Zone," however, the young Canadian choreographer divides his  cast into teams of three, a unifying structural premise drawn from the  accompaniment: Beethoven's mighty Triple Concerto for Piano, Violin and Cello.  </P> <P> Color-coded in Santo Loquasto warm-up suits, each team has its own movement  signature -- a scooping/swimming gesture, perhaps, or a recurrent running lift  -- but all are alike in their surge to cover space, their serene,  non-competitive athleticism.  </P> <P> But if three people make a stable, productive unit in Kudelka's world, he  doesn't trust twos. As in his bitter study of sexual incompatibility, "The  Heart of the Matter," the central pas de deux here details a nasty power  struggle, one defined through formalized arm wrestling and resolved positively,  it seems, only because Beethoven's music mandates a hopeful conclusion.  </P> <P> In style, the workis propulsive, muscular, intense -- requiring the full  technical resources of contemporary ballet in the trios plus considerable  dramatic heat and extraordinary stamina in the turbulent duet. San Francisco  Ballet responded Saturday with dancing that amply fulfilled Kudelka's thematic  purposes without ever coarsening the musical line. Kudelka, after all, may be  the obvious successor to Kenneth MacMillan in the realm of downbeat  contemporary dance drama, but he works at a level of taste and sophistication  (especially in his choice and use of music) that MacMillan has never reached.  </P> <P> In the overlapping ensemble passages, some of the finest young dancers of the  company flashed by, including Andre Reyes, Lawrence Pech and, once again, the  prodigiously accomplished 20-year-old Elizabeth Loscavio.  </P> <P> On Saturday, the pas de deux belonged to Evelyn Cisneros and Anthony Randazzo  -- she memorably stifled, rebellious, but fascinated with her partner/opponent  in spite of herself and he superbly unyielding, manipulative, instinctual until  combat yielded to accommodation. So much for modern romance.  </P> <P> Jean-Louis LeRoux led a polished account of the score, with Roy Bogas, Roy  Malan and David Kadarauch the capable soloists. "Ballo della Regina" and  "Rodeo" (both previously reviewed) completed the program.  </P></p>

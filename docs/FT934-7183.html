			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Capital Spending (13): Simplicity - the stamp of modern opulence / Alice Rawsthorn considers the aesthetic of three chic new designers THE sumptuous 18th century square of Place Vendome is the historic heart of the Paris luxury trade. It is here that Madonna parks her white stretch limousine when she checks into the Ritz and where Arab princes slip into Boucheron to buy baubles for their mistresses. A glance through the arched entrance to 16 Place Vendome reveals a different brand of luxury. An old stable in the courtyard has been turned into a modern building with white walls and an industrial floor to house the European headquarters of Comme des Garcons, the fashion and furniture business owned by Rei Kawakubo, doyenne of avant garde design. Kawakubo's designs conform to the conventional definition of luxury by being made from the very best materials, finished to the highest specifications and sold at achingly expensive prices. Yet where most luxurious products are steeped in nostalgia, her work, like that of other modernist designers such as Jasper Morrison and Marc Newson, is contemporary in terms of how it looks and the way it is made. Nostalgia looms large in the luxury trade as do other sepia-tinted terms such as 'tradition' and 'authenticity'. Most luxury companies are at pains to remind clients that they have been around for centuries. Anyone who buys an Hermes silk scarf or a piece of Louis Vuitton luggage is made aware that it carries the legacy of years of craftsmanship and an aura of privilege. The horses trotting across an Hermes scarf reassure the consumer that, by spending Pounds 135 on a silk square, they are tapping into a tradition dating back to 1837 when Emile Hermes made saddles for the swankiest stables in Paris. The traveller splurging Pounds 13,860 on a Stokowski trunk from Vuitton knows that it has been made by hand in virtually the same way as when Leopold Stokowski, the conductor, ordered the original 50 years ago. The affluent shoppers at Hermes and Vuitton are the 1990s' counterparts of the nouveau riche 19th century industrialists - described by Corelli Barnett, the historian - who celebrated their new found wealth by copying the lifestyles of the landed gentry. Part of the attraction of an Hermes scarf or Vuitton bag is that they are instantly identifiable as expensive because of their association with an aristocratic past. Modern luxury has the appeal of being unequivocally rooted in the present. Prada bags, made from fabric developed for the aerospace industry, have a clean, contemporary look that could only come from the latest technology. The Pleats Please collection of intricately pleated silks developed by a Japanese laboratory for Issey Miyake also have a modern air. Other designers achieve a contemporary effect through the aesthetics of their work. The Lockheed Lounge, designed by Marc Newson, an Australian working in Paris, is an abstract slither of shiny aluminium which was originally inspired by a 19th century chaise longue. The Lockheed Lounge has the same opulent shape as the original chaise and, having been made in a limited edition of 10, a similar whiff of exclusiveness. There the resemblance ends. The Lockheed Lounge is unmistakably modern in style: so much so that Madonna ordered one for her Rain video. But it is made by hand through a laborious process of hammering aluminium panels on to a mould. Marc Newson is now working on a sleeker, streamlined series of aluminium furniture, the Event Horizon table and Orgone chair, which are also hand-made by a special technique first used to make Aston Martin sports cars. 'I liked the idea of making something by hand that was so complex it looked as though it must have been manufactured by machine,' he says. Whereas Newson's furniture is unashamedly luxuriant, the Progetto Oggetto range of household objects belongs to the restrained school of modern design. Progetto Oggetto is a collection of everyday products - everything from a first aid box, to clothes hangers and ash trays - commissioned from contemporary designers by Cappellini, the Italian furniture company. The aim of the range, according to Jasper Morrison, the London-based furniture designer who helped compile it, was that the designers should 'reinterpret forgotten products' and that their designs should have 'a rational quality so that the function is obvious'. The result is a collection of subtle objects. The first aid box by Thomas Eriksson is made of lacquered steel in the shape of a red cross. Andreas Brandolini has designed a cunning set of library steps that doubles as a book basket. Each product is meticulously made and extremely expensive: Pounds 260.85 for the first aid box and Pounds 434.28 for the steps. Yet Progetto Oggetto also marks a new departure for the luxury industry by devising thoughtfully designed, highly priced products that are practical, rather than decorative. Comme des Garcons' version of modern opulence has the same iconoclastic stamp. The recurrent themes in Rei Kawakubo's designs are minimal styling and technological innovation. The discoloured dresses in her current collection are typical. They are made from patchworks of faded paisley fabric from which the dye has been extracted, sometimes so strongly that the original pattern is little more than a smudge. The ethereal effect is the result of the latest textile technology. Kawakubo, who for years has worked mainly in black, says that she wanted to create a completely new colour. Hiroshi Matsushita, the Japanese textile technologist with whom she has worked throughout her career, developed a special process to remove dye without damaging the fabric. The discoloured dresses, with their faded fabric and ragged edges, could scarcely look less like conventional status symbols. Crumpled or not, there is a market for Rei Kawakubo's vision of modern opulence. Her dresses went on sale earlier this autumn at the Comme des Garcons shop in London and sold out.

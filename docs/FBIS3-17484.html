Nazarbayev had serious grounds to change the time of  departure: the joint working group in charge of preparations for  Kazakhstan-Russia summit talks failed to reach complete  understanding on all items put on the agenda of the forthcoming  talks.    Most likely, Nazarbayev wants to get acquainted with the  sides' viewpoints on the spot to be ready to make appropriate  political decisions and, possibly, even introduce appropriate  adjustments to the position of his country's experts.    Local analysts believe that similar steps are now being  taken  by the Russian side as well. The two states attach paramount  importance to maintaining and developing the historically  established close mutual relations. Therefore, it is highly  probable that the positions of Kazakhstan and Russia will draw  closer together even before the two leaders hold an official  meeting.    As far as differences are concerned, sources close to the  leadership of the republic name several of them, including  problems connected with the future of Baykonur cosmodrome, the  conclusion of a customs union between the two countries, the  elimination of the aftermath of the tests of nuclear weapons on  the territory of Kazakhstan, a prolongation of the agreement to  maintain the specialisation of defence-industry enterprises, and  the repayment of mutual debts for the rendered services and the  earlier supplied products.</p>

In a communique issued by the Mexican Consulate in McAllen,  Texas, the Mexican Finance and Public Credit Secretariat (SHCP)  said this measure had been agreed upon to avoid the jams that  have occurred at the Reynosa and Matamoros, Tamaulipas custom  stations. The document explained that they are trying to ease  and control the international movement of people and merchandise  from the United States to Central American countries through  Mexican territory.    Based on Article 116 paragraph one of the Customs Law,  foreigners who want to enter Mexico at border points between  Acuna, Coahuila and Matamoros, Tamaulipas will be able to do so  at the previously mentioned customs stations.    The SHCP also said the Lucio Blanco-Los Indios crossing is  part of the Matamoros Customs Office and the facilities at the  Colombia, Nuevo Leon Customs Office are adequate and are open 24  hours a day.    The communique said that once foreigners are given migrant  status, they can take their equipment with them but they will  have to request a 10-day temporary permit for the vehicle they  are travelling in. It added that people interested in moving  merchandise through Mexico should consult a customs agent, who  will take care of the necessary procedures at both customs  offices.</p>

			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / Banking watchdog calls for members Small banks were criticised by an independent bankers' group yesterday for not joining the Banking Ombudsman Scheme. The Code of Banking Practice Review Committee said they were denying their customers independent arbitration on disputes. The review committee, an independent group which reviews the banks' voluntary code of banking practice, said in its annual report that it was 'disappointed at the comparatively small number of banks' that had joined the scheme. The 65 banks that are members cover nearly all personal banking customers in the UK, but the committee is concerned that small foreign banks dealing with ethnic minorities tend not to join the scheme. Annual membership to the ombudsman scheme costs Pounds 2,500. It said 99 per cent of customers were covered, but it was 'unsatisfactory that there remains a minority of customers, albeit small, which has no opportunity of having complaints dealt with by an impartial outside arbitrator'. The committee said it was surprised that some small banks had refused to join on the grounds of cost because the annual charge for smaller banks had remained un-changed for eight years although annual running expenses had grown. Mr Martin Karmel, the committee's secretary, said that all building societies were compelled to be members of the scheme, but this was often inappropriate for small banks because many of those operating in London had no personal customers. Mr Karmel said the committee was particularly worried at the number of foreign banks serving ethnic minorities in the UK which were not part of the scheme. Banks were asked to give reasons for not joining in the committee's annual compliance survey. Mr Karmel said that banks generally appeared to be becoming more aware of their responsibilities under the code of banking practice. Fewer banks were explaining their responsibilities to customers in 'gobbledegook'. The committee's fourth review of the code is due to start in March. Annual Report 1994.

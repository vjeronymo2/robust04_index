			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / International Company News: Gerstner sees progress from IBM shake-up Mr Louis Gerstner, who took over as chairman and chief executive of International Business Machines 18 months ago, claimed yesterday he had succeeded in making the lumbering giant of the computer industry more fleetfooted. 'The elephant is dancing,' Mr Gerstner said, 'but it is not going to be in a Fred Astaire movie too soon'. Answering questions at his first European press conference since taking charge of the ailing US computer manufacturer last year, Mr Gerstner said one of his main tasks was to speed up the responsiveness of the company. 'I think we have made a lot of progress,' he said, but added that '18 months is not a very long time and this process will take longer'. Next week, IBM will report its third-quarter results and Wall Street analysts are expecting the company to continue its progress with earnings of around 90 cents a share, compared with an operating loss of 12 cents a share in last year's third quarter. The IBM chairman declined to comment on persistent speculation that the company may take an equity stake in Apple Computer. But he confirmed that IBM has 'ongoing discussions with Apple in the areas where we have very important joint activities'. These include joint development of PowerPC microprocessors and two software joint ventures. Mr Gerstner said IBM had a continued commitment 'to be the basic foundry' of the computer industry, but too often it had developed new technology only to see competitors exploit it more quickly. 'There have been many examples where other companies have exploited that technology faster than IBM.' He said IBM expected to ship personal computers based on the PowerPC microprocessor, jointly developed with Apple Computer and Motorola, in the first quarter of next year. Apple and Motorola are already selling PowerPCs. On the restructuring, the IBM chairman said progress in Europe towards meeting competitive cost levels was ahead of schedule and that the group as a whole was on target to reduce its worldwide workforce to 215,000 by year-end. Asked if he was satisfied with IBM's share of the PC market, which fell from about 14 to about 10 per cent over the past year, he acknowledged IBM had had some problems.</p>

			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Staying afloat They scarcely need reminding, but gilts traders will certainly see yesterday's floating rate auction announcement as another sign of how difficult market conditions have become. The Bank of England has not auctioned conventional medium-dated stock since February. While the floating rate device spares the need for abrupt cancellation of auctions in the unfortunate manner of Germany, Austria and Spain, it must hope that normal business can be resumed soon. There are sensible reasons for issuing floating rate debt, but they will fail to convince if such auctions become a habit. As long as the Bank believes in its own ability to hold inflation down - and therefore base rates at reasonable levels - floating rate borrowing may turn out cheap. The trouble is that the more frequently the Bank issues floating rate debt, the more its critics will worry that it is adding to inflationary risk. Some economists are already anxious about the expansion of M0 money supply and the low real level of short-term interest rates. Since the main buyers of floating rate gilts are banks, they will fret that the Bank is monetising government debt as well. Such mutterings are muted at present. But they are bound to grow louder if many more floating rate issues appear. That speaks for the occasional large issue rather than a continuing series of smaller ones. The first floating rate gilt was a modest Pounds 2.5bn affair that has proved to be illiquid. The Bank would appear under better control of its funding policy if it now risked a much larger floating deal. It could then announce that no more floating issues were to follow and that it would not return to the fixed rate market until conditions really do improve.</p>

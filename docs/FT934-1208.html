			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / Australia and US air peace Australia and the US have reached agreement on a new three-year aviation pact, which will give two airlines from each country equal access to the valuable North Pacific route, from the US via Asia to Australia. The deal follows a vicious and protracted aviation dispute between the two countries earlier this year. Under the agreement, which is effective immediately and will last for at least three years, each country will be able to designate two carriers to serve the route. Each of these four carriers will then be offered a start-up capacity of three frequencies per week. Any growth in capacity on the route after this will only take place if the carriers in aggregate achieve a 70 per cent passenger load factor, and if at least 55 per cent of their passengers represent 'through-traffic' from the US to Australia. Australia will also receive a number of new route rights, including Mexico, as a new 'beyond and intermediate point' on the South Pacific route, and some additional points in the US on the North Pacific route. At present, Minnesota-based Northwest Airlines is the only US or Australian carrier operating on the North Pacific route, three times a week. Chicago's United Airlines has long sought to fly daily from New York to Sydney via Tokyo, but has encountered problems with both the Australian and Japanese authorities. Australian carriers, meanwhile, have been hampered by the former restriction which guaranteed US airlines unilateral access to the first eight frequencies on the route each week. Now it seems likely that Qantas - the country's long-established international airline - will be one of its designated carriers. Ansett, primarily a domestic airline but now pushing into the international arena, could be a second. The new agreement follows a bitter dispute this year, when Australia claimed Northwest Airlines, the US carrier, had breached a '50 per cent cent' rule, unilaterally imposed by Australia, on North Pacific flights. Under this condition, Northwest faced a 50 per cent limit on the passengers which it could carry on the Japan-Australia portion of its Sydney-Osaka-Detroit flights.</p>

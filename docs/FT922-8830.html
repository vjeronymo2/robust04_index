			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / Employment Training faces review as criticism mounts A COMPREHENSIVE review of Employment Training, the government's controversial Pounds 800m scheme for the long-term unemployed, is to be launched shortly by the Department of Employment. The investigation follows concern both within the department and among Training and Enterprise Councils (Tecs), which administer ET, over the effectiveness of the programme in achieving qualifications and jobs for participants. Three months after leaving the scheme, most trainees are unemployed. Set up in 1988, ET was criticised by Mr David Mellor, the former Treasury chief secretary, in last year's round of public expenditure negotiations. The real value of ET's budget fell slightly. ET, along with Youth Training and other aspects of the department's training budget, is likely to come under renewed pressure in this year's negotiations. Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary, said in a recent letter to chairmen of Tecs that she wanted to be in a position to 'demonstrate the effectiveness and real value for money of what we do in order to defend our performance and our budgets' in the public expenditure negotiations. The quality of ET has been consistently criticised by Tecs, many of which want to experiment with different approaches, including extending training vouchers to the adult unemployed. Some Tecs want shorter but higher quality training. The Department of Employment would need to persuade the Treasury that such a move would lead to more job placements. Such a shift would be politically sensitive because fewer people on ET would have an impact on unemployment figures. Critics of ET have claimed that ET as it stands is an initiative designed to get people off the unemployment register. The most recent figures showed that slightly less than half of the 126,787 trainees completed the training agreed with their provider. The majority did not obtain a qualification.</p>

For the second consecutive day, he did not answer a call from  the second office of the Senate. Nevertheless Senator Romel  Manigat remains optimistic about a positive response from the  commanding general of the Army. This delay is understandable:  He is preparing his case, the senator stated.    [Begin Manigat recording, in Creole] (?Despite the delay),  we  have no doubt that the commander will come because Gen. Cedras  is a man of honor, he is a man of his word, a man who knows how  to respect his commitments toward the Senate. So, we believe  the case is so important that we cannot treat it thoughtlessly.  If the high command deems it necessary to take some time to  present a good case, it is normal that we, Senate members and  wise men, understand the difficulties and we will wait for him  because the steps we have taken have not been taken for  ourselves, but have been taken on behalf of the Haitian nation.  The military institution really needs to provide many  explanations to the Haitian community. [end recording]    The senators waited until very late for the arrival of Gen.  Raoul Cedras. Sen. Thomas Eddy Dupiton was sent to the Army  General Headquarters to inquire about this delay. According to  Sen. Dupiton, the commander in chief of the Army was trying to  contact the various commands in the nine geographic departments  of the country before coming to the Senate to answer the  senators' questions. However, there was tension, sharp tension  at the Senate. Sen. Bernard Sansaricq even demanded a vote on a  censure motion against Gen. Raoul Cedras, an idea that is not  shared by some parliamentarians including Sen. Dupiton, Sen.  Ebrane Cadet, and Sen. Margareth Martin.</p>

			<p><P> November 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOME RULES OF THE ROAD  </P> <P> Airport officials and some shuttle van operators have called for a tightening  of the rules governing commercial passenger vehicles to improve passenger  service and alleviate confusion and congestion at the airport. Here are a few  of the most frequently abused rules of the Los Angeles Department of Airports  as well as some solutions that the department has proposed:  </P> <P> * Van operators are allowed to announce their destination twice and then  actively load passengers.  </P> <P> * No more than three vans from the same operator may stop at one time at a red  curb traffic island.  </P> <P> * Vans may make a maximum of two consecutive circuits around the airport's  lower level roadway then must depart the airport and not return within 20  minutes even if the van is transporting only one passenger.  </P> <P> The Department of Airports is considering the following rule changes:  </P> <P> * Drivers would be prohibited from stopping longer than 45 seconds to solicit  business, unless actively engaged in loading passengers.  </P> <P> * Van companies would be required to display a large destination sign atop the  vehicle -- not inside the windshield.  </P> <P> * Van companies would be required to install $50 transponders that would  electronically track the number of times a van circuits the airport. The van  would be charged a fee for each time that it completes the route, thus giving  van operators an incentive to leave the airport more quickly.  </P></p>

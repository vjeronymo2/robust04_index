			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / International Company News: BP deal enhances Statoil's position in northern Europe STATOIL'S decision to acquire 240 petrol stations in Sweden from British Petroleum forms part of the Norwegian state oil company's plans for expansion in the northern Europe/Baltic region. The deal lifts Statoil's share of the Swedish market to 26 per cent from 18 per cent. Statoil also acquired BP's 20 per cent shareholding in ODAB, a Swedish petroleum storage and distribution company. The deal marks the exit of BP from Scandinavian retail petrol sales, although it will continue to sell aircraft fuel, lubricants and some petrochemical products in Sweden. It also propels Statoil to the position of Scandinavia's leading retailer, with 2,000 petrol stations, and secures it a place among the biggest petrol retailers in northern Europe, where Shell is market leader. In 1992, Statoil's sales of petroleum products in Scandinavia reached NKr15.5bn (Dollars 2.2bn). Yesterday's deal is expected to increase this by 6 per cent, or NKr800 to NKr900m, according to Mr Staffan Riben, president of refining and marketing. Last year, Statoil acquired 260 BP petrol stations in Ireland, giving the group an 11 per cent market share there. Statoil established itself in the Swedish retail petrol market in 1986, when it acquired nearly 400 petrol stations from Esso. In the same year, Statoil bought 400 petrol stations in Denmark, also from Esso, where it has a 20 per cent market share. It has a NKr2.2bn investment programme to build a condensate plant adjacent to its Kalundborg refinery in Denmark to double production of high-quality petrol for export to Baltic countries. In 1992, Statoil established subsidiaries in Germany, Poland and Latvia, and opened two petrol stations in Estonia where it will soon open another. 'During the next few years we will be seeking to develop further our presence in the Baltic states,' Mr Riben said. In July, Statoil plans to open one station in Latvia, and has plans for further expansion there. It is also considering establishing a presence in Lithuania. This summer, the group aims to open three stations in north-eastern Germany but has plans to establish a retail network there comprising between 100 and 150 stations. In July, Statoil will open one station in Poland and another soon after, while in the autumn it will open one in the Russian port of Murmansk.</p>

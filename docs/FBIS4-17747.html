			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 27 Apr -- Boris Yeltsin thinks that Russia's  relations with Western countries have recently radically  improved and that Russia has attained the level of partnership  as far as some of these countries are concerned. However, he  told today's meeting with the chiefs and staffers of the foreign  intelligence service, "it is now particularly important to draw  a distinction between partnership and attempts to dominate or to  foist on us their own actions, which run counter to Russia's  interests. It is unacceptable to Russia."    Russia, stressed Boris Yeltsin, has its own view of the  priorities in the foreign and domestic policies and it also has  interests of its own on the international arena. This is  convincingly shown in the settlement of the Bosnian crisis and  Russia's activities in close neighboring countries. However,  noted the president "we have recently come to see clearly that  such activities by Russia do at times cause irritation." Boris  Yeltsin expressed the thought that the political campaign  surrounding the so-called "Ames" affair illustrates this  clearly. The real motives and goals of this anti-Russian  action, continued the president of Russia, have clear political  overtones.    Boris Yeltsin said that American intelligence is stepping up  its efforts to acquire an agent network in Russia, but U.S.  special services think that the foreign intelligence service and  its military colleagues from the GRU have no right to act in the  same manner. "I can give assurances," said the President, "that  Russia is no longer prepared to reconcile itself with this kind  of discrimination. We are ready to take all the measures  provided for in international law to rectify the situation."    "Russia," stressed Boris Yeltsin, "is for an equal and  mutually advantageous cooperation and mutual respect, and I  believe that our partners will learn to take account of our  position."</p>

			<p><P> May 28, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT IS A NATURAL ISSUE FOR POLITICIANS  </P> <P> In a 30-second sales pitch beamed into the living rooms of California voters,  John K. Van de Kamp gazes over a panoramic view of the golden state: Parklands.  Waterfalls. The Big Sur coast.  </P> <P> "He's sponsoring Big Green -- the environmental initiative to protect our  coastline and outlaw cancer-causing pesticides," intones the campaign ad's  unseen announcer.  </P> <P> Yet only weeks ago on Earth Day, the biggest environmental celebration in 20  years, it was not Van de Kamp who dominated television screens in Southern  California. It was Dianne Feinstein.  </P> <P> For weeks, she had refused to take a position on the initiative. But with an  eye carefully cast to political advantage, she chose two successive Earth Day  celebrations in voter-rich Southern California to embrace the most sweeping  environmental initiative ever proposed.  </P> <P> This year in California, politicians are rushing like lemmings to stress their  commitment to what is left of California's natural resources.  </P> <P> "Everyone today is an environmentalist," Atty. Gen. Van de Kamp said recently,  with more than a touch of sarcasm in his voice.  </P> <P> Indeed, as much as anything else, the environment has become the  motherhood-and-apple-pie issue during Van de Kamp and Feinstein's months-long  tussle for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination. On hot-button topics, there  is even bipartisan unity, with Republican Pete Wilson as well as the two  Democrats opposing offshore oil drilling. And all three have taken pains to  tout their environmental stripes in television ads.  </P> <P> To some environmentalists, that similarity defines the problem this year for  voters. Between deeply felt positions and political expediency, the three major  candidates for governor have all crafted records that -- if not perfect -- at  least inoculate them against a full-scale attack against their environmental  credentials.  </P> <P> "The voters could be confused readily by the barrage of inputs that they could  be getting," said Patricia Schifferly, regional director for the Wilderness  Society. "It's going to be very difficult."  </P> <P> Much of the difficulty centers on merging a complex issue such as environmental  preservation with the quick-hit sound bites and television ads that define  politics in California.  </P> <P> "Environmental issues in the '90s don't lend themselves to explanations in 30  seconds," Schifferly said. "Many of them are interdependent. On the line is the  desert ecosystem. On the line are the wetlands. On the line are the ancient  forests."  </P> <P> Statewide, leaders of environmental organizations are preparing to issue  reports on the records and positions of the three gubernatorial candidates.  Because their conclusions are pending, many declined to be interviewed for this  story.  </P> <P> When Van de Kamp and a host of environmental leaders last August unveiled the  "Big Green" initiative, which is expected to be on the November ballot, it  quickly became the marker against which other environmental platforms were  measured. For months, while Feinstein decided whether to support it, Van de  Kamp questioned her level of commitment.  </P> <P> Feinstein, meanwhile, has used specific environmental issues as wedges to  separate Van de Kamp from his environmental supporters. Weeks ago, she began  what has become a persistent criticism of the attorney general by arguing that  he has been lax in tracking down toxic dumpers.  </P> <P> Earlier this month, trying to regain the offensive after a rocky few days  following their first debate, she announced her opposition to the state's  malathion spraying program, and rebuked Van de Kamp for his role in defending  the Deukmejian Administration effort. Hours later, he responded by joining her  in opposing urban spraying.  </P> <P> Environment issues mirror the candidates' approaches to many of the pressing  issues of this campaign -- Van de Kamp more specific and lawyerly, Feinstein  more centrist and conciliatory.  </P> <P> Van de Kamp's environmental platform is, pure and simple, Big Green. It would  ban 24 pesticides known to cause cancer in humans within 5 years, with a  three-year extension allowable if there was no alternative. It would ban  imported food grown with pesticides, outlaw offshore oil drilling, rule out  clear-cutting of redwood forests and prompt deep cuts -- a 40% decline in 20  years -- in the gases that affect the earth's ozone layer. It also calls for  the election of an independent environmental advocate and the establishment of  a $500-million fund to finance the cleanup of oil spills.  </P> <P> The attorney general has traveled throughout the state for Big Green, sometimes  at a loss to his own campaign: When surrounded by environmentalists from  organizations which are nonpartisan, Van de Kamp has had to carefully avoid  mentioning his own aspirations.  </P> <P> But the collision of his candidacy, the environmental initiative and the rise  in voter interest in the subject undoubtedly has helped Van de Kamp. In an  April trip through the Central Valley, he carefully surrounded himself with  human symbols of environmentally related suffering, a rare personal touch for  the attorney general's campaign. The mother of an 11-year-old boy who blames  her son's death from leukemia on the pesticides that were sprayed near their  home stood next to him in Bakersfield; up California 99 in Fresno, a farmer  whose ill health forced him to turn to pesticide-free agriculture was at Van de  Kamp's side.  </P> <P> Van de Kamp and his campaign aides say, however, that until they recently began  running ads connecting the attorney general and the initiative, he had not  benefited as much as he hoped.  </P> <P> "Am I satisfied with the connection up to now? No," said campaign consultant  Bob Shrum, who is helping run the Van de Kamp campaign. "But starting a week to  10 days ago, I think people are getting the point."  </P> <P> However strongly Feinstein can ally herself with Big Green now, the  environmental platform she unveiled in the week before her endorsement of the  initiative was more moderate.  </P> <P> Rather than ban pesticides outright, for example, the former San Francisco  mayor vowed to accelerate University of California research into integrated  pest management, or natural ways of ridding farmlands of pests. Rather than set  a specific timetable for reducing gases that contribute to global warming, she  called on the state to "pursue standards to reduce atmospheric emissions."  </P> <P> Trying to escape from the Big Green shadow, she also has proposed environmental  education for California schoolchildren and reorganization of the state's toxic  strike force into a high-activity "swat team".  </P> <P> Some of Feinstein's environmental plans are tentative. Questioned a week ago  about a mandatory state recycling program she suggested in April, Feinstein  said she was still studying a range of options.  </P> <P> "The details need to be worked out and they will be," she said. "But what I'm  saying is that this is what I stand for. I'll get lawyers and staff to draft  the stuff once I get there."  </P> <P> Big Green and Van de Kamp also skip over some details -- it is never explained,  for example, how global warming gases would be cut by 40% in 20 years.  </P> <P> While her endorsement of Big Green has taken the edge off criticism by  environmentalists, Feinstein remains dogged by the image of not being a  forceful ally in the past. According to many of those involved the 1986  anti-toxics initiative Proposition 65, Feinstein's support for the measure was  tempered after opponents pressured her.  </P> <P> "She's been so middle of the road -- on anything," said Van de Kamp supporter  Tom Epstein, the initiative's campaign manager. "Sort of Wilsonesque on how  careful she is in following a middle course."  </P> <P> Wilson -- in the background for months, with no major opposition in the primary  -- is likely to be in the news again soon, when President Bush announces his  long-awaited decision on oil drilling off the California coast.  </P> <P> "Wilson has been careful enough that it's going to be difficult for a Democrat  to make the environment a dividing issue," said Epstein.  </P> <P> The senator is the only one of the three candidates not endorsing the  initiative. Yet he, too, has earned some kudos from the environmental  community.  </P> <P> "Sierra Club is extremely grateful for your consistent support of strong  legislation for clean air as well as other environmental protection measures,"  the club's president, Richard Cellerius, said in a letter commending Wilson as  one of 18 senators in the 'Clean Air Honor Roll.' "Your votes for strong clean  air legislation . . . did not go unnoticed in the environmental community."  </P> <P> Wilson has benefited from comparisons with other Republicans who are less  moderate on environmental issues.  </P> <P> "He is . . . one of the better Republican candidates," said the Wilderness  Society's Schifferly, who has disagreed with Wilson on several issues. "He is  definitely a real step above (Republican Gov. George) Deukmejian."  </P> <P> Wilson's strong suit has been his opposition to offshore oil drilling, a stand  he has maintained since the Carter Administration. He is credited with spurring  President Bush's 1988 campaign change of heart on offshore drilling, and of  pressing for a moratorium on the leasing of offshore tracts.  </P> <P> "I am not an election year convert to these causes," he told the environmental  group Heal the Bay earlier this year.  </P> <P> Wilson also has proposed a Cabinet-level Environmental Protection Agency for  the state, and has vowed to use the governorship as a "bully pulpit" to  persuade Californians to do their part for the environment.  </P> <P> But Wilson has been at odds with environmental groups as well, angering them in  1988 when he opposed a bill giving wilderness protection to 8 million acres in  the Mojave Desert and in 1986, when he did not endorse the anti-toxics  initiative. And he remains distanced from activists this year because of his  refusal to endorse the sweeping Big Green initiative.  </P> <P> "The environmental litmus test for all the gubernatorial candidates is their  support for the environmental initiative," Al Meyerhoff of the Natural  Resources Defense Council said recently.  </P> <P> "Rhetoric is running freely now. Everyone is claiming to be an  environmentalist. So we need a little truth in advertising."  </P></p>

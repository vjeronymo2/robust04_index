			<p><P> March 24, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> NEW MOUNTS SOUGHT FOR ZIMBABWE'S DISABLED  </P> <P> The Zimbabwe Red Cross has launched an appeal for donkeys to replace  wheelchairs used by disabled people in the countryside.  </P> <P> "What is the point of giving a disabled person a wheelchair in the rural areas  where you know it's unnavigable and long distances are involved?" spokesman  Victor Chitongo asked.  </P> <P> "A donkey has been found to be suitable because it's unlike a wheelchair which  needs repairs," he said. "It feeds while the user is in class."  </P> <P> Chitongo said the society is willing to pay about $15 for each donkey, about a  tenth the cost of a wheelchair.  </P></p>

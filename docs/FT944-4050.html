			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Weekend Money: Brave new biotech world - Scientists are trying to reshape nature. What's in it for investors? The children of biotech are re-designing life on earth. A clutch of tiny companies, run by scientists, is creating fantasy products - and gobbling up capital. Morphosys is selling made-to-order evolution, finding the best performer from a billion versions of a single molecule. Zylepsis is creating new foods and cosmetics. GeneCo is breeding pest-resistant crops. Yet, the typical biotech company makes no profits. Neither has it sales or revenues. Its health is assessed by calculating the rate at which it is burning up investors' money, which gives an estimate of the number of months it can expect to survive. Why any investor would start watching burn rates - a process akin to calculating the distance between a lemming and the edge of the cliff - is a good question. The answer, to judge by the nearly 200 British biotechs that investors have helped launch in the past decade, lies in the hope that any one could produce a blockbuster before it burns out. Since the discovery in 1973 of a way to cut and splice DNA, the molecule that contains the design code for living organisms, biologists have been equipped to have a second try at nature. They can eliminate flaws, design new molecules, and mass-produce those extracted previously from a living host. Three big prizes beckon: The chance to improve food supplies by creating crops that generate higher yields more quickly, and by growing them in previously hostile conditions. The promise of crops that no longer give out the biological signals that attract particular pests to them, so providing an alternative to chemical pesticides. The hope that biotechnology could produce cures for a multitude of human and animal diseases - the biggest prize of all. These are the dreams. Translating any one of them into reality requires a team of dedicated scientists, up to 10 years - and close on Pounds 100m. Even then, failure is possible. Products for human use must undergo numerous laboratory and animal tests before clinical trials. Then comes testing on human volunteers (for adverse side effects), followed by trials on a small sample of those the product is designed to help (for dosage). Finally, the product is tested on a much larger sample (for a statistically significant improvement in their condition). Products can fail at any of these stages. Even the brightest of estimates suggests a success rate of less than one-third for products that begin clinical trials. Others run at closer to one in 10. Of those that do get through trials, not all will succeed in getting licences from the national regulatory authorities. The traditional approach to these risks, taken by the large pharmaceuticals companies, has been to run a development pipeline supported by an existing sales stream, providing both funding and a spread of risk. But the companies, keen to get into biotechnology, have been unable to attract the scientists they need. Leading-edge biologists are interested in commercial applications - but not in trading their autonomy for middle management posts overseeing programmes ruled by commercial considerations. Preferable by far is the option of running their own companies and their own programmes, while making the most of their academic roots through development meetings with university researchers, or by employing former colleagues as consultants. As company heads, scientists have been active in setting up technology transfer agencies to link commercial and university researchers, and a few have been backed by investors willing to fund academic teams as a way of gaining access to new ideas. Yet, such a package, while a golden opportunity for scientists, is a tall order for investors who are backing business novices in the riskiest of ventures. In the US, a tradition of wealthy business angels, and the existence of the Nasdaq stock exchange for young and growing companies, spurred a shower of biotech start-ups in the 1970s, and a flood during the 1980s. In the UK, however, things moved more slowly. 'Biotechnology is the antithesis of attractive investment capital,' says David Leathers, of UK venture capitalist Abingworth. The quality of British science, with 12 British or UK-based Nobel prize winners in biotechnology research since 1970, did eventually attract the braver venture capitalists. But even this proved insufficient. In 1992, British Biotech, the UK's leading company in the field, began urging the London Stock Exchange to accept research and development companies. It succeeded, with a rule change in December 1993 that opened the exchange to blue-sky issues based on companies' potential rather than their track record. Other biotech concerns have turned to pharmaceutical companies, giving up some of their production and marketing rights in exchange for development funds, although some in the industry describe this as giving away the biotechs' birth-rights. But companies such as Celltech, another leading UK biotech venture, see themselves as research boutiques rather than future large-scale manufacturers. For them, the lump-sum payments as they reach milestones in the development process, and the prospect of royalties, have been sufficient incentive to enter such collaborations. The problem for the pharmaceutical giants is knowing which biotech company to back. Many of them adopt a portfolio approach: backing several promising research programmes in the hope there is a winner among them. It is, however, a hit and miss business. In an industry where innovation is everything, the invention of a more reliable method of picking winning ventures could be the greatest biotechnological breakthrough of all.

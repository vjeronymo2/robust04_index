			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Markets Report: Dollar steady Concern about Orange County bankruptcy developments and weak US stocks kept the dollar trading in a narrow range yesterday, writes Philip Gawith. With no fresh economic data to trade off, markets had a quiet day. The dollar closed in London at DM1.5773, from DM1.5777, and at Y100.165 from Y100.465. The most interesting event was the decision by parliamentary supervisors in Finland to reject a proposal by the central bank to raise the base rate by 50 basis points to 5.75 per cent. The bank did, however, raise its key money market rate, the tender rate, to 5.5 per cent, from 5.01 per cent. Sterling finished the day slightly weaker, constrained by political worries and an opinion poll showing the Labour Party with a 39.5 percentage point lead over the ruling Conservative party. It closed at DM2.4601, from DM2.4674. In Europe, the D-Mark finishing slightly weaker against most currencies. Ms Sirkka Hamalainen, Bank of Finland governor, downplayed the significance of the rejected base rate increase. She said the tender rate was 'much more important' from a monetary policy perspective. Ms Hamalainen said the base rate was more an instrument for distribution of income than a key monetary tool. She said the board of management had been unanimous that it would have been a good signal to raise the base rate. 'I think it would have had a positive effect on inflation expectations,' said Ms Hamalainen. The most recent Merrill Lynch global investor survey, conducted on December 1, reveals some interesting currency portfolio shifts. The survey shows that since the third quarter, global fund managers cut back some of their overweight exposure to the D-Mark, while lifting modestly their exposure to the US dollar. Investors are now similarly weighted in both dollars and D-Marks. Investors 'significantly raised' their exposure to the British pound, and appeared most overweight in the ADollars /NZDollars currency bloc. The survey found that investors continued to be very underweight the Japanese yen. This is a function of it being overvalued on a purchasing power parity (PPP) basis. Merrill Lynch point out that PPP is a particularly poor criterion for valuing the yen, which moves more closely in tandem with Japan's long-term current account trends. The biggest portfolio shifts occurred in the non D-Mark continental European currencies (French franc and Italian lira), and the Canadian dollar. The survey said the portfolio shifts 'clearly indicate a preference on the part of investors to move into currencies where the domestic monetary authorities are exercising the greatest restraint.' Currency positioning also appears 'to be influenced more and more by shifts in short-term interest rate differentials.' There is increasing evidence that Orange County is beginning to affect US interest rate expectations. Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank in London, said that concerns about wider financial system risks, reflected in weakness on Wall Street, 'affect the timing, rather than the direction in which interest rates are going. I don't think it alters the general profile of a tighter monetary policy over the next 12 months.' The Bank of England provided late assistance of Pounds 345m, and Pounds 759m at established rates, to UK money markets, after forecasting a Pounds 1.1bn shortage.</p>

			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LABOR, WOMEN ADDING TO FEINSTEIN FUNDS  </P> <P> Democrat Dianne Feinstein is pulling in big money from organized labor,  traditional party loyalists and women as she tries to become California's first  woman governor.  </P> <P> Together, she and her husband, Richard C. Blum, are the largest donor, having  lent the campaign $3 million during the primary. And in the latest reporting  period, ended Sept. 30, organized labor provided about $1 million, or roughly  $1 of every $5 that Feinstein raised, campaign finance records show.  </P> <P> A large number of her donors have been women, but with some exceptions, the  size of their checks has been modest. Few women have given more than $1,000,  and many have donated $100 or less, campaign finance reports show.  </P> <P> "We don't have a lot to give," said Jane Hasler Henick, co-chair of a state  political action committee of the National Women's Political Caucus, a  Feinstein supporter. "We women are writing checks for $100. If we had more,  we'd write checks for more."  </P> <P> One exception is Deborah Castleman, 36, an electrical engineer and public  policy analyst for the RAND Corp. in Santa Monica. Castleman is not wealthy,  but she is a believer -- so much so that she raided her savings of $28,000 and  donated it to Feinstein.  </P> <P> "I don't care about money for retirement. This is more important," Castleman  said.  </P> <P> Castleman became a believer after she heard Feinstein speak to a gathering of  the Los Angeles Women's Campaign Fund in Beverly Hills in May, 1989. In  addition to donating her own $28,000, Castleman has prodded family, friends and  acquaintences to donate another $50,000.  </P> <P> "I very much believe in the power of role models," she said. "They are a  powerful influence. I have a lot of nieces. I want them to see that a woman can  be governor."  </P> <P> Feminist Beverly Hills attorney Gloria Allred also has been working hard for  Feinstein, having raised $50,000 by early October. Allred expects to raise at  least $40,000 more.  </P> <P> "Our daughters should have an opportunity to see a woman at the highest  position of our state government," Allred said, adding that Feinstein is the  first candidate for whom she has sought donations.  </P> <P> Feinstein had raised about $10 million through Sept. 30, compared to $19.4  million for Sen. Pete Wilson. Feinstein and Wilson both received about one of  every three contributions from women, according to a random Times survey of  5,000 contributions to each candidate during the most recent filing period.  </P> <P> Feinstein, who hopes to raise at least another $4 million by the Nov. 6  election, saw her fortunes change dramatically when a federal judge last month  struck down a $1,000 limit on individual contributions.  </P> <P> During the four days between the judge's ruling and Sept. 30, she raised more  than $900,000. Her biggest single gift -- $150,000 -- came from the California  Highway Patrol officers political action committee.  </P> <P> Other six-figure donors listed in the latest report were the Los Angeles County  District Council of Carpenters, which gave $110,000, and the United Food and  Commercial Workers, which gave $106,000.  </P> <P> John Plaxco, her chief fund-raiser, said the campaign made a "conscious effort"  to avoid money from the insurance industry, tobacco concerns and oil companies.  Her finance reports reflect little or no money coming from these sources. Nor  is there money coming from sources identifiable as being affiliated with horse  racing or other gambling interests. There are relatively minor amounts from the  liquor industry.  </P> <P> Feinstein received $5,000 from the California Real Estate political action  committee. Sacramento developer Angelo Tsakopoulous, a friend of San Francisco  Mayor Art Agnos, gave $22,000. Concord developer Kenneth H. Hoffman gave  $100,000. Tens of thousands more dollars have come from an array of San  Francisco developers, companies that contracted with the city and political  allies from Feinstein's days as mayor of San Francisco.  </P> <P> Several Democratic politicians are working hard for Feinstein. Rep. Nancy  Pelosi (D-San Francisco) has given the most so far, $12,000, and has raised  $33,500 more, the latest report showed.  </P> <P> Times staff writer David Willman and researcher Norma Kaufman contributed to  this story  </P></p>

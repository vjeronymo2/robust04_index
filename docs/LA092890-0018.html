Defense attorneys said they hope to show jurors today the art gallery, where  "Robert Mapplethorpe: A Perfect Moment" was on exhibit last spring in  Cincinnati, drawing record crowds. The Contemporary Arts Center and its  director, Dennis Barrie, were indicted on misdemeanor charges of pandering  obscenity and using minors in nude photos the day the controversial  retrospective opened.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Speaking during an interview with the press at  Government House this morning, Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai  Phanitchaphak said he supported the U.S. decision to continue  giving trade privileges to China under most favored nation  status. He said the Chinese people would become even poorer and  the problem of human rights in China would never be solved if  the United States decided to stop giving such privileges to  China because of its poor human rights record. He disagreed  with the United States for linking trade talks with other  issues. He said that constituted interference in the internal  affairs of others.    Concerning Thailand, he said the United States tried to link  the special trade privileges given Thailand with Thailand's  treatment of its labor issue. Suphachai said this is not  approriate because Thailand has been trying to solve its problem  by fully adhering to international norms on labor. The Thai  Government has always tried to irm the United States whenever  its labor organizations tried to interfere with or instigate the  Thai labor force. He said that at the meeting of the  International Labor Organization, Thailand and its allies would  try to counter the United States on this matter.    Suphachai said that the Thai Government has been trying to  solve trade problems with the United States by fully complying  with international rules, such as suppressing pirated tapes, and  protecting intellectual property. Yet, there are certain areas  where Thailand cannot comply with U.S. demands. He noted that  without Thailand as its friend, the United States would hardly  have any friends left.</p>

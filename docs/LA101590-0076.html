			<p><P> October 15, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 90 SICKENED BY FUMES AT 2 VEGAS HOTELS; SEWER GAS SEEN AS CAUSE  </P> <P> More than 90 gamblers and vacationers, complaining of nausea and breathing  difficulties, were hospitalized Sunday after being overcome by an apparent  release of sewer gas inside two hotel-casinos on the Strip.  </P> <P> "It looks as if some sewer gas backed up, affecting the Excalibur and  Tropicana," said Clark County Health Officer Dr. Otto Ravenholt.  </P> <P> The two hotel-casinos are located across the Strip from each other and have a  combined total of about 7,000 rooms. The resorts were not evacuated.  </P> <P> "It has been a sizable response to a relatively mundane problem," said  Ravenholt. "But the examination of how it came about and how it can be  precluded will take days or weeks."  </P> <P> A sewer line problem was reported east of the Strip earlier Sunday. "It may be  related," said Ravenholt.  </P> <P> A Mercy Ambulance spokesman said 95 people were transported to six area  hospitals in a three-hour period. None was believed seriously injured.  </P></p>

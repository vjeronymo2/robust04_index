			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / World Trade News: US fights its corner over tax demands The US's top tax official met international trade negotiators at length in Geneva yesterday in an attempt to justify his country's wish to have the freedom to treat foreign services companies differently for tax purposes from local companies. The proposal - for a US exemption from the obligation under the proposed Uruguay Round agreement on global trade liberalisation to provide 'national treatment' on taxes for foreign service providers operating in the US - has provoked a storm during the final stages of negotiation in Geneva. 'Trade negotiators in Geneva may not be tax experts, but they are not fools,' one negotiator said. Negotiators claim the US demand, which would be illegal under the rules of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade if it were applied to manufactured goods, would torpedo Uruguay Round efforts to liberalise trade in financial services. This in turn would hobble plans to bring services trade within the scope of Gatt rules for the first time in the Gatt's 45-year history. Mr Les Samuels, assistant secretary for tax affairs at the US Treasury, faced a barrage of criticism at a four-hour meeting with negotiators in Geneva. These ranged from claims the US wants to have its cake and eat it, to threats withdraw offers to open up financial services markets. The US official commented after the meeting that Washington preferred to rely on 'tried and tested methods' of agreeing cross-border tax arrangements, embodied in 56 bilateral tax agreements with countries around the world. 'The Treasury is concerned about ambiguities in the (Uruguay round) language, and how it might impact its ability to pass laws. We should stick with what we have got and not go off the cliff into the unknown,' he said. Asked why none of the 56 countries with whom the US has tax treaties supported the US position, Mr Samuels said there was 'a difference in balancing trade objectives with tax objectives'. One trade negotiator attending the Samuels meeting yesterday said: 'We have already gone a long way to accommodate US concerns in the draft agreement. To be told at the eleventh hour that even this is not acceptable has caused a major and violent reaction.' The US move prompted Mr Peter Sutherland, Gatt's director-general, to voice concern about 'certain positions which have been taken recently on financial services (which) may prove to be utterly counter-productive'. He added in a formal statement: 'Unless there is an urgent review of these positions, not only will the effort we have made. . . . to improve existing offers falter, but the important progress that we have already achieved may begin to unravel.' Mr Samuels will meet Mr Sutherland today. Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US Treasury secretary, has faced pressure from both Senate and Congressional committees to examine tax treatment of foreign companies. Many in the US accuse foreign companies of dodging payment of US taxes by using transfer pricing policies that minimise the value added by US operations, and hence the local tax liability.</p>

			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / International Capital Markets: Private banks to open in India INDIA is to have large, new domestic privately-owned banks, the first in 25 years, under the latest stage of its economic liberalisation programme. The new banks will compete directly with state-owned institutions which dominate the market and with foreign banks, which are active in many commercial centres, including Bombay, Calcutta and Delhi. Indian industrial groups are planning to launch banks in the next year or two following the publication of guidelines last week for the entry of private companies into banking. The Reserve Bank of India published the rules after many months of debate among bankers and officials. Supporters of the government's wide-ranging economic reforms see banking deregulation as an integral part of the programme, but senior executives of the powerful state-owned banks have tried to delay the opening up of the industry. Indian banking has been dominated by the state since 1969, when the government nationalised 14 leading banks and encouraged them to expand, taking banking into the villages. Banks were ordered to deploy 40 per cent of their agricultural loans to small businesses. Foreign-owned banks escaped nationalisation and new foreign banks were allowed into the country on tightly-restricted terms. The first company to establish a new bank is expected to be Housing Development Finance Corporation, a fast-growing private sector mortgage finance group. Other companies planning to enter the business include Tata and S K Birla, two of India's largest industrial conglomerates. Much to the chagrin of smaller-scale entrepreneurs, including Indians living abroad, the reserve bank has set high minimum capital for new banks of Rs1bn (Dollars 35m), a hurdle which would seem to rule out small banks. The new institutions will be required to ensure their capital amounts to at least 8 per cent of assets. They will also - like existing state-owned banks - be obliged to lend to farmers and small businesses, a requirement which could prevent the new institutions from trying to cream off the most profitable segments of the banking market. The reserve bank will also have the right to determine how large the founder-company's share of the bank's capital should be and how much of the equity should be set aside for sale to other shareholders, including the public. This rule will enable the central bank to keep close control of bank ownership. The long-awaited announcement of the private-sector bank rules meets one of two conditions laid down by the World Bank for a Dollars 500m loan to India for restructuring its financial markets. The other condition, yet to be met, is that India should clean up the bad debts of the state-sector banks which total some Rs170bn. Much of this has been lent to lossmaking state-owned industrial companies.</p>

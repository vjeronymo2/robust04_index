			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / BT fears rivalry from cable networks BRITISH Telecommunications is seriously concerned about growing competition from cable companies offering telephone services. Mr Arthur Thompson, a senior BT marketing manager, has warned staff that if it does not respond effectively to the competitive threat, BT could lose up to Pounds 500m in residential business by 1996. The warning appears in Prospect, BT's internal magazine for marketing staff. Mr Thompson says that cable franchises cover 14m BT customers and 'will put at risk over 60 per cent of our residential revenue'. This, he concedes, constitutes an even bigger threat to BT's residential business than that of Mercury Communications, the Cable and Wireless subsidiary. The number of cable telephone customers is modest, but the upward trend is dramatic. Figures from the Independent Television Commission show that the number of cable lines grew from 2,224 in January last year to 47,902 in July this year. Many of the large cable investors are north American telephone companies which are building cable networks with capacity for telephones. Customers are being offered discounts of up to 15 per cent. Mr Thompson concludes: 'The cable companies are highly professional. We can certainly beat them, but only if all parts of BT work together.'</p>

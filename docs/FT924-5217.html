			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / The Property Market: Rooms to let - Vanessa Houlder examines the increasingly bleak outlook for Europe's battered markets The property recession in Europe is gathering pace. The malaise that has swept through its overheated markets over the past three years has now gripped Germany, until recently one of the last bastions of stability. Across Europe, prime offices fell in value by 5.2 per cent in the third quarter this year, bringing the decline over the past year to 18.7 per cent, according to UK-based property consultants Richard Ellis. Estimates vary, but office values have fallen from their peak by between 5 per cent and 10 per cent in Germany, 25 per cent in Paris, 20 per cent-plus in Madrid, 10 per cent-20 per cent in Milan and by 50 per cent in the UK. The downturn is scarcely surprising. At a time of high real interest rates across Europe and increasing concern about recession, it would be remarkable if property markets were not feeling the pressure. The nature of the market, notably its long planning and building periods, forces the sector to endure deeper troughs than other industries. But the problems go deeper than the recession. Continental European markets have more in common with the volatile US and British markets than is often assumed. The problems created by inflated prices and a surge in credit and construction activity in recent years have proved more damaging than expected at the time. In any event, although vacancy rates in continental markets have risen sharply recently, they are unlikely to even remotely match the record levels in the US and Britain. In Paris, 2.5m square metres - some 6 per cent - of the total stock is vacant. This figure could rise to 10 per cent, says Jones Lang Wootton, chartered surveyors. In Madrid, vacant space has increased to 412,000 sq m (7 per cent of the total stock), with a further 277,000 sq m under construction, according to Richard Ellis. Some 400,000 sq m are due to come on stream during 1992-93, half of which is on the outskirts of Madrid in developments such as Campo de las Naciones or La Moraleja and Las Rozas Business Parks. In Germany, the diverse nature of the property market, which is spread between five cities, strict controls on bank lending on property and a generally restrictive planning structure, have kept supply low by European standards. Nonetheless there is concern about developments on the outskirts of Munich, while in Frankfurt the current vacancy level - 3 per cent - could rise to 5 per cent by the end of next year. The speculative frenzy that was unleashed after German unification in October 1990 has raised serious doubts among property agents about the possibility of future oversupply in Berlin. Now that most west European markets have slowed down, there is much uncertainty about prospects for recovery. Doubts persist over crucial elements of the international economy, such as the European exchange rate mechanism, the ratification of the Maastricht treaty on closer European union, and the stalled international trade liberalisation talks. In spite of this economic gloom, Germany is likely to remain the most resilient of Europe's large property markets, while the UK will remain Europe's worst hit - even though sterling's exit from the exchange rate mechanism in September has allowed the British government to lower interest rates by three percentage points, accelerating hopes that the property downturn may soon be bottoming out. In Spain, one source of comfort is the relatively low level of borrowing of the leading investors and developers. One notable exception is Prima Inmobilaria, the Spanish property group which over-extended itself by buying property during the heady days. Of the continental markets, Paris probably gives the greatest cause for concern. Its problems dates back to the late 1980s when - as in London  - banks, rather than investors, dominated the market. Banks lent enthusiastically to property because the sector appeared to offer profitable returns at a time of intense competition. Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, estimates that average margins on French property loans were 3 per cent compared with average margins of 0.1 per cent on corporate lending in 1989. French property loans have risen to FFr215bn in 1992, up from FFr63bn in 1988, says Goldman Sachs. Provisions for bad property loans could rise to 5 per cent of the total loan book, it adds. Attention in France is particularly focused on the FFr75bn lent to highly-geared small and medium-sized brokers which entered the market as small-scale developers in the late 1980s. These developers have been badly hit because they are under-capitalised and do not have large rental income or parent companies to cushion them during the downturn. Although most continental markets vary in terms of lease agreements, the structure of the investment market and banking practices, many of the property trends have a common origin: namely the increasingly international outlook of banks, investors and tenants at the end of the 1980s. At the same time, one of the factors influencing the rise in rents in most European capitals was the rapid expansion of corporate activity ahead of the creation of a barrier-free European market in 1993. High rents in Europe were underlined by a recent survey which found that 12 of the 17 most expensive office locations in the world were in Europe. Another influence forcing values up was a surge in cross-border investment activity, itself the result of a relation in investment controls in Europe. As well as pan-European investment, funds flowing into the European Community, particularly from Japan, rose from Pounds 820m in 1985 to Pounds 4bn in 1989, according to Hillier Parker, chartered surveyors. In France, for example, foreign inward investment doubled between 1989 and 1990, with the Japanese among the more prominent investors. In the UK, 30 per cent of all institutional property was owned by non-British groups by the end of the 1980s. And in Spain, a surge in economic growth, the country's admission to the EC in 1986 and the lifting of restrictive rent laws in 1985, attracted inward foreign investment. The pricking of the bubble throughout Europe was prompted in part by the retreat of international investors, many of which were increasingly burdened with problems in their home markets. Yet as so often, the German experience has bucked the trend. In recent months there has been a flurry of investment by German buyers in the London office market. This is seen by many analysts as a tentative sign that the UK  -the hardest hit market in Europe - may have seen the worst.</p>

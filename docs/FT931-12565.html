			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / More bad news for Japanese manufacturers JAPANESE manufacturers' inventories of unsold products, as a proportion of sales, are still rising despite a 6.1 per cent cut in industrial production last year, official figures reveal. The figures, published by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry yesterday, show industrial output last month was 1 per cent down from that of November, and 8.2 per cent down on that of the equivalent month in 1991. The fall in production was worse than officials had expected and suggests further cuts in Japanese manufacturing output will be made before inventories are reduced to levels allowing production to start growing again. Industrial production has been falling for 15 months, the longest run of consecutive falls since the slump in output during the first oil price shock between May 1974 and December 1975. Manufacturers' inventories are rising as a proportion of their sales because consumption has slumped, particularly of large costly items such as furniture, cars and electronic household goods. Miti's preliminary figures for December show shipments of goods from factories fell 0.8 per cent, while the absolute level of inventories fell 0.6 per cent. However, the ratio of inventories to sales rose by 0.4 per cent as consumption fell away. Industrial output for last year as a whole fell by 6.1 per cent, shipments by 4.8 per cent and inventories by 0.9 per cent. Last year, the inventory-to-sales ratio was up 9.5 per cent. Miti expects output to rise 1.9 per cent this month and 2.3 per cent next, despite a continuing fall in consumption. Separate Miti figures published yesterday show sales of large retailers fell 5.7 per cent in December.</p>

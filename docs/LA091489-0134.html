			<p><P> September 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THERE'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT RING TO APPROACH OF NEW KING COACH  </P> <P> The Stanley Cup ring that Wayne Gretzky wears is a mass of gold, a dazzle of  diamonds.  </P> <P> A Stanley Cup ring is a wondrous thing. Rather common among the Kings, these  days, but wondrous just the same.  </P> <P> Larry Robinson has a collection of Stanley Cup rings that he won while playing  for the Montreal Canadiens. Mike Krushelnyski and Marty McSorley started their  collections while playing with Gretzky at Edmonton. John Tonelli got his while  with the New York Islanders.  </P> <P> The ring that their new coach, Tom Webster, wears is much smaller. It's plain  gold. No stone. It commemorates the year that he coached the Tulsa Oilers to  the championship in the Central Hockey League. That same year, the league  folded.  </P> <P> "That was, uh, 1983-84," Webster says, holding the ring up at just the right  angle so that he can read the date. "That was probably my most satisfying year  as a coach. I felt so proud of what we were able to accomplish, in spite of  some of the hardest obstacles, against the greatest odds."  </P> <P> A brief silence greets this revelation.  </P> <P> Can he possibly be serious? Does he actually think it's wise to call attention  to his days with the Tulsa Oilers when the question underlying all the hundreds  of questions put to him during this training camp, really, is whether or not  he's the right man to coach these Kings?  </P> <P> Webster seems not to notice the silence. He seems not at all concerned about  convincing any reporters of anything. He's not trying to be wise, any more than  he's trying to wise off.  </P> <P> He has been asked about his coaching history, and he's happy to tell the war  stories, telling them with the ease of a man who enjoys the folks around him  whether those folks are strangers in an airport lounge, reporters in a press  room or superstars on ice.  </P> <P> Webster zips right through the story of the season that his own team, the  eventual champion, actually folded before the league did.  </P> <P> The oilman who owned the Oilers -- an affiliate of the New York Rangers -- had  some money troubles and they found themselves without a rink. The league,  however, decided to put the players and coaches in a hotel in Denver and had  them finish the season as a traveling team, kind of like the Harlem  Globetrotters.  </P> <P> "Valentine's Day, we found out," Webster says. "I said, 'Isn't this sweet?' So  our families all went home and we played our last 33 games on the road, and  then all our playoff games. Which meant we played, maybe, 60 games of the total  season away, putting to rest the notion that you can't win on the road."  </P> <P> Webster leans forward and smiles as he gets to the part that he knows is going  to get a big reaction, even without having Ed McMahon to ask: "How bad was it?"  </P> <P> "At one point, while we were still in Tulsa, we were having to practice on the  ice rink in a shopping mall. We'd have the players up at 5:30 in the morning,  arriving in their gear. We couldn't use pucks or we would have been breaking  all the shop windows. So we practiced with a Nerf soccer ball!"  </P> <P> No more silence. Webster has won over his audience.  </P> <P> "It was an exciting season," he says. "I had to improvise and adjust. We had to  stick together as a team and do it as a team. We had fun with it. Ask Chris  Kontos about it. Or Gord Walker or Ron Scott."  </P> <P> Webster has just named everyone currently on the Kings' uncut roster who can  verify his stories. Who can say whether they had as much fun as their coach  with what some might see as a nightmarish experience.  </P> <P> "Ask Robbie Ftorek, he was on that team."  </P> <P> Now, there's a punch line.  </P> <P> Robbie Ftorek's name has been mentioned often during this training camp as  everyone except Webster himself compares -- or rather contrasts -- Webster and  Ftorek. Webster refuses to discuss the coach he replaced at the end of last  season.  </P> <P> "That's not fair for me to do," Webster said. "Robbie is Robbie. He did his  thing. You look at yourself and you do what is the best to suit the hockey  club."  </P> <P> The most obvious difference between the two is style. Ftorek set himself apart  -- from the fans, from reporters, often from the owner, even from the players.  He apparently thought he never had to explain himself to anyone.  </P> <P> Webster is a communicator and a people person. As is the Kings' owner, Bruce  McNall.  </P> <P> McNall likes his team to be one big, happy family. So far, the family is happy  with Webster.  </P> <P> Asked how he thought the team was reacting to Webster, McNall said:  "Spectacular! All the players I've talked to really seem to enjoy him.  </P> <P> "He talks a lot. He's a good communicator. We know he can be stern when he has  to be. I think they have a great deal of respect for him."  </P> <P> Gretzky backs that up, saying of Webster: "He's first class. He has a  tremendous amount of respect from all the players. He's very fair. He's easy to  talk to and easy to deal with. He has the right attitude. He wants us to work  hard, but enjoy it."  </P> <P> Luc Robitaille's early impression: "I like him. I can talk to him. I think you  can say that he's laid-back. But I wouldn't want to fool with him."  </P> <P> General Manager Rogie Vachon said: "He can compromise, but he can also be  tough. This can be a tough team to handle because of the personalities. Some of  the players who were regulars last year might not be this year. It might be  hard to keep everyone happy."  </P> <P> But at least Webster is concerned about doing that. He wants to keep the team  in a happy balance. And he differs with Ftorek's philosophy of treating all  players the same. Remember Ftorek's insistence that all players, including  Gretzky, were just pieces of the puzzle?  </P> <P> Webster said of Gretzky: "He's one of the best hockey players ever. Why not  play him as much as I can? I'd be a fool not to play him as much as I can."  </P> <P> Webster realizes that he's dealing with a veteran team. He treats them  accordingly. At 40, he's older than any of them, but not by much.  </P> <P> And said that, depending upon how the season developed, he would have no  problem with giving veterans such as Robinson and Gretzky extra days off, maybe  even short vacations mid-season, if he thought it would help them be ready for  the playoff stretch.  </P> <P> Asked if it bothered him that Gretzky is so close to McNall, and has been  influential in whether deals were made or not made, Webster said: "Heck, no.  The more you can get from everyone in the organization, the better. The  successful organizations have staff, management and players working toward a  common goal."  </P> <P> The goal?  </P> <P> "The goal is the Stanley Cup," he said without flinching. "It's attainable.  It's there. We've made the proper acquisitions."  </P> <P> Webster is, himself, one of the acquisitions. And he seems to understand all  the attention being paid to how he sees his role with the team and how the team  sees him.  </P> <P> "The coach is part of the team," Webster said. "He's a part of the team as well  as the players. The job of the coach is to set some form of leadership and  guidance. They look for that. And preparation. Having them prepared is my job.  </P> <P> "I need to help them with leadership, guidance, direction -- and patience."  </P> <P> He seems quite confident, but he knows there is some concern about his lack of  experience as a National Hockey League coach.  </P> <P> Webster played in the NHL, for Detroit in 1970-71 and for Oakland in 1971-72,  and in the World Hockey Assn., for New England 1972-79. He finished his playing  career with one year in Detroit. He worked his way up through the coaching  ranks, then, coaching the Red Wings of the American Hockey League to the Calder  Cup title in 1981, and moving on to the Central Hockey League, where he won the  title.  </P> <P> The Rangers hired him to coach in the NHL, but he coached only 14 games in the  fall of 1986 before having to resign because of inner ear problems that  required surgery and made it impossible for him to fly.  </P> <P> "The stint in New York helped prepare me for this job," Webster said. "But  going back to Windsor (to coach his hometown team in the Ontario Hockey League)  helped, too. Coaching at any level gives you a chance to experiment, improvise,  improve."  </P> <P> And McNall likes to point out that Webster has won at every level.  </P> <P> He coached Windsor to an OHL title.  </P> <P> It's all hockey.  </P> <P> Asked if he thinks that he is taking over one of the toughest jobs in hockey,  if he thinks there is a gun at his head to win a Stanley Cup, he said: "I don't  think there is any easy job in coaching. You put pressure on yourself.  </P> <P> "I do think we are expected to win. But I think that's good. It's so nice to  know that we have that kind of talent. It's there. Now we just have to do it."  </P> <P> That's a pretty tall order, a pretty sobering thought.  </P> <P> Good thing he has those lucky purple Christian Dior socks his wife bought two  years ago.  </P> <P> He blushed as he told it, but he was asked if he had any superstitions. A lot  of the guys in hockey do, you know. So Webster had to tell about the World War  II medal that his father, Tom, left him. And he had to tell about his ritual of  eating spaghetti on the afternoon of a game. And the socks.  </P> <P> "This is embarrassing," he moaned. "My wife said purple was the lucky color  that year. When it turned out she was right, and those socks really were lucky,  my son borrowed them and ended up scoring the winning goal in overtime one  night. We haven't washed them in two years.  </P> <P> "There's more, but I'm afraid I've said too much already."  </P> <P> Got any lucky sweaters?  </P> <P> "No, not sweaters," he said, laughing as he saw the trap developing. "The  sweaters are Robbie's, and we're not talking here about Robbie, are we?"  </P></p>

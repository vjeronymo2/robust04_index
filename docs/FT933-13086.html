			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / Business and the Environment: And polluted flows the Po - Agricultural waste has taken its toll of Italy's main waterway This is the time of year when thousands of tourists descend on Italy's Adriatic coast, one of Europe's holiday magnets, and hotels from the Venice Lido to Rimini start raising prices and dusting off 'full up' signs. Few on the packed beaches will be bothered much about the state of the Adriatic. The disastrous summer of 1989, when an invasion of algae blackened beaches and left hoteliers facing ruin, has been long forgotten. But although less conspicuous than in the past, water pollution remains the Adriatic's Achilles heel. Italian scientists do not know where the algae came from and why they grew so alarmingly. Pending an explanation, local tourist bosses will continue watching the waters carefully for signs of a revival. Most observers agree one of the keys to the problem is the River Po, Italy's main waterway and one of Europe's prime arteries. Terminating in a broad and beautiful delta just south of Venice, it passes through Piedmont, Lombardy and the Veneto - three of the country's biggest, most industrial and most heavily farmed regions - before reaching the sea. About 37 per cent of Italian industry is in the Po basin, while the resident population is nearly 16m - more than a quarter of the total. In the past three decades, the Po has become synonymous with pollution. Big riverside cities, such as Turin or those nearby, like Milan, have used it as their dustbin. Urban sewage, though treated, has not always been up to standard. At smaller towns and villages along the river, enforcement has sometimes lapsed. Many big businesses also depend on the Po as a free resource or a drain. Cooling water from riverside power stations drives up river temperatures, harming what marine life is left. Environmentalists warn that dumping rules are far from foolproof, while industry adds a potent cocktail of phenol, solvents and toxic metals. But the biggest pollutant is agriculture, according to Roberto Passino, the man in charge of the authority for the Po basin, the main watchdog over water quality and the riverside environment. The Po valley is Italy's biggest stretch of flat land, making it ideal farmland in a largely mountainous country. Agricultural traditions stretch back for centuries; the ricefields around Pavia have even influenced northern Italy's cuisine, with risotto as popular as pasta. Rice growing is one of the worst offenders, Passino says. The pressure to compete against cheaper Asian producers means farmers use pesticides heavily to control crop damage and improve yields. Pesticides, weedkillers and fertilisers pervade north Italian agriculture. Farmers have started cutting back to save money, but much damage has already been done, he says. The worst has come through chemical seepage into the water table, affecting local drinking water. About 70 per cent of drinking water in the Po valley comes from underground reserves. Chemicals have also found their way into the Po, damaging water quality along the river and eventually the Adriatic. However, it is livestock, not farming, which represents the greatest threat, warns Passino. The surge in pig farming in the past 30 years has triggered a vicious circle of pollution. While the size of herds has soared, the space available has remained virtually constant. 'The quantity of waste produced is immense,' he says. Though some can be used as natural fertiliser, that is only a fraction of the total. Chemical treatment - the main alternative - has been limited so far and is not always adequate. Transportation, another option, is expensive and potentially hazardous because of accidents. Breeding pigs is part of local culture, particularly around Parma. But the industry has grown exponentially through its own growth and the rise in diary farming. Reggio Emilia, next door to Parma, is synonymous for Italians with Parmesan cheese. As dairying expanded, farmers looked for profitable sidelines for waste dairy products. Pigs provided the answer. No one is talking about closing down pig breeders or doing away with Parmesan, Passino stresses. But other countries with heavy concentrations of livestock farming, such as the Netherlands and Denmark, have pursued much more interventionist policies to ensure breeding is distributed more evenly around a region. In spite of the challenges facing the Po, Passino tries to remain optimistic. 'It's not true that it's a grossly polluted river - though there are sections which are especially bad. The Rhine is much worse. What I say is that it could be much better than it is.' Creating the authority was a big step forward. 'For the first time, we are putting people round a table and getting them to work together. Our main function is to prepare a plan for the Po and then supervise its implementation', he says. 'First, we need to think about how feasible various steps might be, then start talking about implementing them.' One strategy will be to persuade farmers to use chemicals more sparingly. Passino has four immediate suggestions to change agricultural attitudes: Greater price controls over pesticides and weedkillers to deter excessive use. Better weather information for farmers, so that repetitive use of chemicals  -necessary after an unforeseen rainstorm - can be minimised. Enforcing charges for the use of water, which is now virtually free, to limit the use of chemicals. Moving away from single-crop farming, which weakens the soil and requires greater use of chemical fertilisers to raise yields. And the Adriatic? Passino, one of Italy's leading experts on water quality, says it has always suffered from pollution. 'Pollution in the Po is certainly a contributor. But it's not the only one, and it's not the single most important factor.' In time, he hopes the river authority's efforts to monitor and co-ordinate regional policies will improve the water quality. But he has no illusions about how long it will take. 'It took 25 years to achieve the first results cleaning up the Thames.'</p>

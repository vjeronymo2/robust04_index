			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / Observer: Knight time search The irony of yesterday's humiliating statement from Barclays bank should be obvious to all but the most short-sighted City fund manager. Here is a bank which has trained the well-regarded chief executives of Midland, Standard Chartered and the TSB, announcing that it can't find a chief executive from within its own ranks. The idea that Barclays' management below board level is any worse than the other high street banks is hard to justify. True, the bank made a fool of itself in the property market and has mucked up its management succession. But was it really necessary for the five knights of the Barclays boardroom to send out such a demoralising signal to the other ranks? Even during NatWest's darkest hour, there was never any suggestion that it should hire a chief executive from outside. No doubt the decision to look externally will be applauded by the corporate governance bores. There is no shortage of out-of-work US bankers who would jump at the chance of running Barclays. Australia's troubled Westpac, for example, has just imported Robert Joss from Wells Fargo. Bank of Scotland's Bruce Patullo, who has made fewer mistakes than most bankers, could be a contender. But his weakness is that he insists on combining the job of governor and chief executive. Whoever it is, the next chief executive of Barclays will almost certainly have to be a real banker since there are not many left on the board. The decision to bring in an outsider is risky. A more sensible alternative would have been to promote a respected non-executive director, like Sir Martin Jacomb, to be chairman and leave the current chief executive to sort out the mess.</p>

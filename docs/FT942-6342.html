			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / Still warning and encouraging: On the eve of his 90th birthday, Warburg's Henry Grunfeld gives Ian Hargreaves his views on today's financial world Henry Grunfeld plans to celebrate his 90th birthday tomorrow with a day off. That will, indeed, make it something special; there have not been many working days off for Grunfeld in the 60 years since he fled from Hitler's Germany and teamed up with Siegmund Warburg to create what has become London's leading investment bank, SG Warburg. Today he works, a portrait of Siegmund over his right shoulder, in a plain corner of Warburg's offices in the City. At one end of the building, razor-headed young traders punch keyboards and grab phones. Around Grunfeld, an oracular stillness sits. Warburg announced last week that Grunfeld will surrender his position as president of the bank next year, but he has no plans to change his routine: weekdays in the office, evenings at home in Belgravia, weekends in his Surrey country home, talking, reading and listening to music. 'I still come in each day because I enjoy it, because it's healthy and because I can make a contribution,' he says. That contribution he sums up in Bagehot's phrase about constitutional monarchs, 'to advise, to encourage and to warn'. The years have not decreased the flow of subjects about which he feels inclined to warn. Whether discussing the 'absolute menace' of hedge funds, Wall Street-style bonuses or the risky financial edifices of derivatives, Grunfeld is forthright. Hedge funds he denounces as anarchic and speculative vehicles. 'I've nothing against Mr (George) Soros personally; I don't know him, he appears on TV and makes a nice impression. But if Mr Soros and his hedge fund can effectively force us to leave the European exchange rate mechanism, there must be something wrong,' he says. The hedge fund technique reminds him, he says, of an earlier generation of British stock pushers. 'They would buy quietly a great number of shares and then make it known that they were buying, so lots of people follow and the price goes up. That's the philosophy of hedge funds.' He discounts the idea, however, that regulators can or should act against such funds, arguing that 'if there are a few more losses, they will regulate themselves'. More serious, he suggests, are the increasingly large and exposed trading positions of many commercial and investment banks. 'That is quite rightly a worry of the central bankers and the regulators. In America, we have the situation where banks which have federal deposit insurance are holding large trading positions. The New York Stock Exchange actually delayed the opening of trading in Bankers Trust until the bank had made a statement about rumours of heavy losses. This is an extraordinary event which has not been sufficiently highlighted.' The spread of derivatives - complex financial instruments based upon future commitments to buy, sell or swap financial assets - has, Grunfeld believes, only compounded the problem by giving traders and their employers a false sense of security. 'A lot of this business is pure speculation,' he says, although he thinks that a recent spate of problems with derivatives contracts involving the likes of Procter &amp; Gamble, Metallgesellschaft, Arco and Dell Computer will cool the over-enthusiasm. 'If more and more customers are losing money, then the volume will go down.' For the banks, he says the key is 'complete separation of traders and accountants', given the long tail of risk that derivatives contracts can drag behind them. Warburg, he acknowledges, has joined the scramble to amass derivatives expertise, which plays a crucial part in the design of many deals for customers, but he argues that Warburg has spent the necessary time training its accountants and displayed prudence in proprietary trading. 'It's all a question of volume. It is not a question of whether Warburg does these things, it's a question of how much we are doing.' As for fat bonuses and remuneration packages, Grunfeld says that years of watching Warburg salaries dragged skywards by American competitors has not altered his underlying view that pay systems have lost touch with reality. 'We can't help it', he says of Warburg's own pay levels, recalling a debate with an American member of the firm about a rumoured Dollars 6m-a-year contract at a rival bank. 'Why shouldn't a man earn Dollars 6m if he makes Dollars 50m for his employer?' came the question. 'I say, 'but what if he loses?' ' says Grunfeld. 'Why, then he is sacked,' says the American. 'That is the great difference between us,' says Grunfeld. 'If someone here makes a mistake, we don't sack him, we try to help him so that it doesn't happen again.' Grunfeld couples this earnest and unfashionable paternalism with passionate advocacy of a more patient approach to banking, based upon building relationships with clients and countries, rather than fighting an endless succession of contests for the next transaction, based chiefly upon price. Asked what Warburg has to learn from its competitors, especially the big American houses it trails in the battle for the so-called 'bulge bracket' of top business-getters, Grunfeld snorts: 'I wouldn't like us to learn the pushy and ruthless way that some of the American houses try to get business.' Asked about Warburg's strategic priorities, however, he names only one: to become a more effective global player, with an ever more effective network. 'The global aspect of the financial services industry is something that will last,' he says, unlike the latest fad in leveraged buy-outs, or emerging markets. 'I like the New York definition of emerging markets,' he adds, 'that an emerging market is one where, when there is an emergency, they don't pay.' He sees the biggest competitive resistance to Warburg on the continent coming not from the American houses, but from the continental universal banks, whose tight links with local business are used to harry foreign investment banks from their turf. 'To me, it is incomprehensible that these banks should be creditors, shareholders and members of the supervisory board of their customers,' he says. 'The power these banks have is far ahead of the American banks.' Behind all these comments lies half a century of culture-building inside Warburg. Grunfeld acknowledges that cultural change has been inevitable as numbers have increased from the dozens he once supervised to the 5,500 who work for the bank across the world today. But the relatively non-hierarchical structure of the bank, designed to encourage teamwork and keep stars happy, is something Grunfeld works hard to maintain. He recalls a recent conversation with a director in his mid-30s looking for guidance about the next decade of his career. Grunfeld's advice: 'If you stay here, you must feel that what you say is being taken into account, that the head of your department only runs the department, but not you. I believe he left my room with a happier face.' Managing large numbers of high-powered, opinionated and ambitious individuals is of the essence in investment banking. With the announcement last week that Sir David Scholey is also to step down next year as the bank's chairman, Warburg faces a shift of generation in its leadership. What are the qualities the new bosses will need? 'The first thing is a strong personality,' Grunfeld says. 'As the business has developed, no chairman can know everything, but he needs to want to be a leader.' The last time Grunfeld was interviewed by the FT, in 1987, he commented famously that 'hiring people is similar to buying a tie. You don't buy the tie when you need one. You buy the tie when you see one and like it.' Although he still believes in his own instinct for spotting talent, he says the days when Warburg would spontaneously hire bright journalists or diplomats in the belief that knowledge of banking could come later are probably gone. He retains his faith, however, in one of the bank's better-known recruitment eccentricities, its use of graphology. In the 1920s, he was working in the family steel business in Germany and petty cash started to go missing. There were three suspects, all of whom had worked for the company for more than 15 years. Grunfeld was persuaded to seek the advice of a handwriting expert, who immediately identified the culprit. Confronted by Grunfeld, the employee confessed. 'We didn't dismiss him and he never did it again,' he says. Grunfeld maintains to this day that graphology will reveal flaws in personality and even health, such as proneness to depression. 'There is not one case in 60 years where the graphologist has said something that turns out to be wrong,' he says. 'The practice is regarded as odd in Britain, but it's widespread in Germany, Switzerland and France.' He thinks it not altogether untypical of his adopted homeland to discount the wisdom and experience of foreigners, even, he notes, while being driven by them from most sections of manufacturing industry. 'Somehow we haven't woken up to the end of empire,' he says. 'All those jokes about frogs may be very funny, but it doesn't help. Frenchmen are to be taken seriously. All I can do is to educate.' One wonders whether Grunfeld, with his self-discipline and his principles, would have been attracted to banking if he were now in his 20s rather than his late 80s. 'Oh yes,' he replies, without hesitation: 'It's the only business I can think of where you have every 30 minutes a new problem or a new situation. In industry, it's more or less the same every day.' He is equally certain that Siegmund Warburg would have wanted none of it. 'He would have accepted the need for the changes, but he wouldn't have liked it.' His co-founder's genius, he says, was 'that he had ideas. He was really two or three persons in one. He was a very good banker, but he never wanted to be a banker, he wanted to be a teacher in a university. He was interested in many things, in people and politics, as well as having a great knowledge of banking.' He admits to not liking the recent account of the Warburg family story, by the American writer Ron Chernow. 'My real objection is that he leaves you with the impression that you would rather not have liked to know Siegmund Warburg. As Goethe said: 'Where there is a lot of light there is a lot of shade.' That applies to human beings. Siegmund Warburg was an outstanding person, with a superb instinct.' How would Grunfeld himself like to be remembered? There is a pause, then a comment about the formative years of the bank in which Grunfeld became a confidant of many senior British industrialists. 'I was like a doctor to them and that's why there will be no memoir. I will leave this world without telling anybody,' he says. Then another pause. 'So far as my role in the firm goes, well someone here said it the other day in three words. 'You ran it.' Well, I did.' The interview over, Grunfeld shuffles to the door. As we disappear down the corridor, he's tapping at the monitor outside his office, muttering: 'Now, what's going on in the stock market?'</p>

			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / International Company News: Loss deepens at Danish shipping group Lauritzen Holding, the Danish shipping and shipbuilding group, suffered a first-half net loss of DKr198m (Dollars 32m), compared with a first-half loss last year of DKr73m. The group takes in the J Lauritzen Shipping Group, DFDS, the North Sea freight and ferry group, and the Danyard shipyard. Sales were up to DKr4.89bn from DKr4.33bn, but the result was hit by a rise in net financial costs to DKr230m from DKr142m and a DKr54m loss on the disposal of vessels. The J Lauritzen Company made a loss of DKr289m, against a loss of DKr118m. The company's fleet of refrigerated cargo vessels was hurt by low freight rates and the weakness of the dollar against the krone. The holding company said it has increased the shipping company's capital by issuing subordinated loan capital of DKr150m. The shipyard also moved into a loss of DKr42m, compared with a profit of DKr66m. The group has predicted a full-year loss of the same order as in 1993, when there was a net deficit of DKr178m. FLS Industries, the industrial conglomerate which is a leading global supplier of cement mills and machinery, has reported an increase in first-half net profits to DKr176m from DKr126m in the same period of last year. Sales advanced to DKr6.45bn from DKr5.6bn, which was mainly a reflection of the domestic building materials group Aalborg Portland being classified as a subsidiary rather than as an associate company. Codan, Denmark's biggest non-life insurance group, recorded a first-half net loss of DKr146m, against a profit in the same period last year of DKr503m. Profits from insurance activities improved to DKr157m from a loss last year of DKr163m, but there were unrealised losses on securities of DKr303m this year against unrealised gains last year of DKr66m.</p>

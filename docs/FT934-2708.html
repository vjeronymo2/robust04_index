			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / Neo-fascists benefit from reformist disunity The charismatic neo-fascist, Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, can thank his reformist opponents in cities such as St Petersburg for his success in Russia's first multi-party elections yesterday. Traditionally a bastion of support for reform, the weekend elections in Russia's second city displayed all the ingredients of what its mayor, Mr Anatoly Sobchak, yesterday described as a 'lesson' for the country's divided and disorganised democrats. Not only did the reformist parties fail to unite around their pro-market and pro-democracy convictions, they also proved unable to counter Mr Zhirinovsky's populist promises with a more coherent message of their own. 'Only Zhirinovsky articulated clear phrases setting out what he plans to do,' claimed Nadya, a speech-therapist who justified voting for him by describing the 12 other parties in the election as 'an amorphous mass'. Selling painful market reforms is harder than promising instant economic well-being, an end to crime and the restoration of national greatness - as Mr Zhirinovsky has done with great skill. A potent cocktail of poverty and intellectual disillusionment with the reformers has created the potential for a fascist surge. But few reformists would argue they ran a good campaign. Nowhere was this clearer than in St Petersburg's Central constituency, where Mr Alexander Nevzorov, a popular ultra-nationalist whose vitriolic '600 Seconds' TV show was recently taken off the air, stood against two democrats who seemed more intent on knocking each other out than on stopping him. In an election where there will be no run-off, disciplined extremists could only benefit. Unlike the pro-government Russia's Choice bloc, and the reformist Yabloko bloc, Mr Zhirinovsky had no problem ordering his representative to stand down in favour of Mr Nevzorov, who has gleefully called these elections President Boris Yeltsin's 'first mistake'. A similar spectacle of democratic ineptitude in the city's Northern constituency bordered on the farcical. There voters faced a record choice of 20 candidates for just one seat in the new State Duma, or lower chamber. Of them only four were attached to a party - including Mr Zhirinovsky's ubiquitous Liberal Democrats. Yet Russia's Choice was not among them. The other 16 represented themselves - with primitive platforms ranging from 'common sense' to 'the restoration of Soviet power and the elimination of presidential power as genetically alien to the people of Russia'. Against this confusion, the city's poverty offered a powerful incentive for a backlash against the recent market reforms. 'The most important thing is to restore order so that people don't go to state shops and re-sell bread for three times as much,' declares Maria, an ice-cream seller and single mother who supports two children on a salary of Rbs80,000 a month (about Pounds 34).</p>

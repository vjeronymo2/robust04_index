			<p><P> March 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR YOUNG ADULTS: THE INVISIBLE ADOLESCENT;  </P> <P> FADE BY ROBERT CORMIER (DELACORTE: $15.95; 310 PP.);  </P> <P> THE MERMAID SUMMER BY MOLLIE HUNTER (HARPER &amp; ROW: $12.95; 119 PP.)  </P> <P> First off, I loved "Fade." Couldn't put it down. There's no question that  Robert Cormier is an exquisite, tight writer, as proven in his celebrated "The  Chocolate War" (1974) and now, in this fantasy that Delacorte Press is  marketing for age 12 and up. It is, however, twice as long as the average young  adult book and there are passages that will make some parents jump from their  seats.  </P> <P> "Fade" is not for kids.  </P> <P> During the summer of 1938 in Frenchtown, Canada, 13-year-old Paul discovers  that he has the power to become invisible. What fun, he at first thinks: He can  avenge the town bully, play tricks on people or, better yet, observe private  lives. Unfortunately, Paul's spying unveils "dark and nasty secrets it was  better not to know about(.)" He is so horrified by the unnatural sexual acts he  witnesses (described clearly), his "Catcher-in-the-Rye" innocence is lost.  After he stabs a villain to death, he vows never again to turn invisible. Thus  ends the novel's first half.  </P> <P> Now flash to 1988. Susan has just finished reading "Fade," a final manuscript  of the now-deceased Paul, the world-famous writer who was also her cousin.  Susan and Paul's literary agent are trying to decide if "Fade" is truth or  fiction, and if it is truth, how utterly incredible. Cormier's novel now moves  back and forth between Susan's narration, Paul's, and Paul's nephew,  13-year-old Ozzie who has inherited the fade.  </P> <P> The destruction and bloody deeds unleashed by Ozzie are unsettling, partly  because the reader is vicariously involved, another testimony to Cormier's  skill. But most of all, it's frightening to think what an unhappy adolescent --  or any of us for that matter -- would do if no one could see us. Cormier seems  to be saying that we have dual natures and depending on who's watching us, two  faces.  </P> <P> My disappointment is not with the author, but with a publisher who misleads its  audience. "Young Adult" is very much different than "Mature, Almost Adult."  </P> <P> "The Mermaid Summer" (ages 8-12) should be read aloud in front of a warm stone  hearth by someone with a Scottish burr. Set in a fishing village during the  1800s, the story tells of "a mermaid who ruled the cold, wild sea that washes  around northern lands." She is a cruel mistress who lures boats onto rocks and  blackmails the townsfolk with her power.  </P> <P> Eric Anderson so fears for his life that he leaves the village to work aboard  an oceangoing ship, far away from the creature's spell. After three years at  sea, his grandchildren, Anna and Jon, ages 12 and 13, decide the only way  they'll ever see him again is if they trick the mermaid. If they can tame her,  then it will be safe for Granda Eric to return. By ingenuity, bravery and a  little help from the town medicine woman, the two kids succeed in doing what no  one had ever done before.  </P> <P> Mollie Hunter unwinds her tale as spontaneously as a village storyteller.  Suspense builds perfectly. As one of Scotland's foremost writers for young  people, she shares the rhythm and language of her countryfolk so well.  </P></p>

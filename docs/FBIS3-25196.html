			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Chaos broke out at a meeting addressed by  Constitutional Development Minister Roelf Meyer in Lenasia last  night when ANC [African National Congress] and NP [National  Party] supporters tried to drown each other out. Outside the  hall Azapo [Azanian People's Organization] supporters shouted  slogans and displayed placards that made no bones about their  feeling for Mr. Meyer.    During his speech, which was interrupted continually by  hecklers and supporters, Mr. Meyer referred to the Freedom  Alliance's [FA] refusal to compromise at talks with the  government and the ANC. He said that if the FA decided to  boycott the election, other parties would look after the  interests of its supporters.    [Begin Meyer recording] Those parties in the Freedom  Alliance  are not going to participate in the election. Then we can  ensure their supporters also from the National Party side that  we will also take care of their interests. [end recording]</p>

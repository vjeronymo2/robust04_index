			<p>CSO   <F P=106> ["Survey Prepared From Data of the Russian State Committee </F> on Statistics": "Production Output and Price Dynamics As of 12  April"]    [Text] PRICES OF CONSUMER GOODS AND SERVICES. Over  the 5-12 April 1994 period, consumer goods and services  increased 2.7 percent, including 1.2 percent for food products,  2.4 percent for nonfood products, and 18.4 percent for paid  services to the populace.    Higher than the average observed across Russia was the  increase in food product prices seen in cities of the Volga  region and Northern Caucasus (2.2-2.3 percent). Virtually no  change in food prices was seen in the Urals, Western Siberia,  the Far East, and Kaliningrad Oblast. Nonfood products rose 9  percent in cities of the Far East, 2.0-2.5 percent in other  regions. The most significant increases in rates for paid  services to the populace were registered in cities of the Urals,  Western Siberia, and Kaliningrad Oblast.    The following table reflects price indexes for goods and  services in the consumer market:                    Percentage of previous date   29 Mar          5 Apr        12 Apr       Average daily price                                            increase   April           March   Consumer        101.8        102.2        102.7        0.36         0.27  goods and  services   including:   food products   101.2        101.4        101.2        0.19         0.20    nonfood         102.6        101.9        102.4        0.29         0.34  products   paid services   101.6        111.9        118.4        2.34         0.45  to the  populace      Since the beginning of the month, the overall increase  in prices amounted to 4.5 percent, including an increase of 2.3  percent for food products, 3.5 percent for nonfood products, and  31.9 percent for paid services to the populace.    FOODSTUFFS. Over the 5-12 April period, the growth of prices  in nonorganized trade amounted to 2.5 percent, somewhat higher  than in organized trade--0.9 percent.    The following table shows the change in prices for basic  product groups:                          Percentage of previous date   Total                 Trade alone   Organized             Nonorganized   All food products     101.2                   100.9            102.5   including:   Meat and meat         101.5                   101.3            102.0  products   Fish and fish         100.5                   100.5            101.5  products   Milk and dairy        101.0                   101.1            100.3  products   Eggs                  99.4                    99.5             97.9   Sugar                 100.3                   100.3            99.9   Bakery products       102.3                   102.2            --   Cereals and           102.7                   102.7            101.4  macaroni products   Vodka                 98.4                    98.4             98.5   Potatoes and          105.1                   105.0            105.3  vegetables      In organized trade, as was the case the previous  month, vegetable prices increased at accelerated rates. Onions,  garlic, and beets increased 11-13 percent in price and fresh  cabbage and carrots rose 4-5 percent. Rates of price increase  greater than those in the ending weeks of March were observed  for flour (2.1 percent), cereals and macaroni products (2.7  percent). Virtually no change was seen over the week in the  prices of meat, butter, vegetable oil, sugar, eggs, and vodka.    Prices rose 5-10 percent since the beginning of the month  for  macaroni products and cereals, salt, fruits, and vegetables. The  price increase was 3.6 percent for milk and dairy products, 1.5  percent for meat and fish products. The average level of prices  for sugar and eggs changed insignificantly. Vodka decreased by  2.2 percent.    In nonorganized trade, as in organized trade, the  greatest price increases were registered with respect to  vegetable output: 17 percent for onions, 13 percent for fresh  cabbage, 3-9 percent for garlic, beets, and carrots. The rate of  growth of prices increased somewhat for meat products in April,  comprising 2.0 percent for the past week. Prices of dairy  products did not change; eggs decreased 2.1 percent.    Cost of the selection of 19 basic food products rose  1.1 percent over the week, totalling R46,000 on a monthly basis  as of 12 April. A 4.4-fold differentiation factor was  registered between cities under observation. Maximum cost of the  selection was recorded in Magadan (R125,400); minimum cost, in  Ulyanovsk (R28,300). Moscow and St. Petersburg occupied 33d and  36th place, respectively, out of 132 cities under observation  with respect to cost of the selection (R50,000 and R49,700,  calculated on a monthly basis).    NONFOOD PRODUCTS. As in March, the rate of price increase  for  nonfood products was somewhat higher than that for foodstuffs.  The high rate of price increases for certain varieties of  medicines--8 percent--was maintained. Prices of garments,  knitted wear, and footwear rose two to three percent over the  week. Cultural and household products increased 1.5 percent in  price, tobacco products, 0.7 percent.    The most significant price increases since the beginning of  the month were seen with respect to medicines (18 percent).    PAID SERVICES TO THE POPULACE. A significant increase in the  rates of paid services to the populace was observed in April,  continuing the trend seen since the beginning of the year. Over  the week, the cost of travel on long-distance trains doubled in  70 percent of the cities under observation. In 13 cities and in  Moscow Oblast, the cost of intercity and local phone utilization  increased by a factor of 1.3-2.0. Housing costs rose 12 percent  on the average across Russia. A more than 200-fold increase was  observed in Perm, Krasnoyarsk, Sovetsk, Yaroslavl, and Kostroma.    PRICES OF MATERIAL-TECHNICAL RESOURCES. The increase in  acquisition costs of basic material-technical resources by  industrial enterprises slowed down in March of this year,  amounting to 10 percent of the February level (February  compared with January--13 percent), including material-technical  resources from suppliers in Russia--10 percent, resources  acquired at the exchange--21 percent, resources acquired from  countries of the far abroad--32 percent. Costs to producers also  rose 10 percent over the past month. Since the beginning  of the current year, costs to consumers have increased 47  percent (costs to the producers of industrial  production--51 percent).    The rise in the cost of building materials was more  significant. Material acquisition costs to contractor  organizations increased 13 percent over the month, 71 percent  since the beginning of the year. The costs of building  materials to producer enterprises increased 13 percent and 59  percent, respectively.    The dynamics of acquisition costs this year for basic groups  of resources is characterized as follows:                        As percentage of previous month          March 1994                                                               percentage of                                                               December 1993   January             February        March   Electric power      118             109          111         143   Thermal energy      118             128          108         163   Fuel                125             113          111         157   Materials and raw   113             113          108         137  materials for  heavy industry   Materials and raw   106             115          119         145  materials for  light industry  and the food  industry   Construction        120             126          113         171  materials, parts  and components      The increase in prices of basic varieties of  material-technical resources used by enterprises of the oil  industry amounted to 29 percent in March as compared with  February of this year; electric power, gas, and coal  industry--12 percent; metallurgy enterprises--22 percent;  chemical and petrochemical industry--13 percent; timber,  woodworking, and pulp and paper industry--10 percent. The  main reason for increased costs of resource acquisition was  price hikes by the suppliers.    Costs of acquisition of certain varieties of materials and  raw materials differed depending on the suppliers. Thus, the  costs of acquisition of energy-producing coal, oil, and  synthetic textile fibers acquired from suppliers in the CIS  countries were 15-20 percent higher than on the domestic market,  while coking coal was 1.5 times more expensive. Fuel oil and  synthetic fibers were acquired more cheaply outside Russia.    The differentiation of prices for the same material resource  acquired within Russia remains significant. Thus, the cost of  iron ore purchased by metallurgy enterprises in March amounted  to R38,000 per tonne in Volgograd Oblast and R57,000 in  Bashkiria. Surveyed enterprises of the chemical and  petrochemical industry in Novgorod and Moscow Oblasts acquired  caustic soda at costs 1.6 times higher than did enterprises of  Samara Oblast and Krasnoyarsk Kray. For enterprises of light  industry, the acquisition of a tonne of single-thread cotton  yarn in Yaroslavl Oblast cost R1.062 million, in Ivanovo  Oblast--R1.747 million, in Vladimir Oblast--R1.815 million, and  in Moscow Oblast--R3.297 million.    Increased expenditures for the transportation of acquired  material-technical resources exerted a definite influence on  price dynamics. In March of this year, the proportion of  transportation expenses in the cost of resource acquisition by  industrial enterprises comprised 9 percent, by construction  organizations--14 percent. Expenses to transport sand  constituted more than half of its acquisition cost; crushed  stone--about 40 percent; cement, asbestos-cement sheeting,  keramzit gravel, roofing material, and wood-particle  board--about 15 percent.    COMMODITY STOCKS. As of 1 April of this year, current stocks  of consumer commodities on hand in retail and wholesale trade  and industry were valued at R11.1 trillion. More than 80 percent  of commodity stocks (R9.0 trillion) were concentrated in retail  trade enterprises.    Trade turnover capacity of stocks in retail trade  enterprises  remained at the level of last year, as shown in the following  table:                          Trillion rubles   As percentage of    Trade turnover                                          1 March 94 level    rates in first                                          (in comparable      quarter 1994                                          prices)             (number of                                                              turnovers)   Total                 9.045             103                 2.7   including enterprises of the following forms of ownership:   state                 3.333             101                 2.3   private               3.268             105                 3.6   consumer              1.500             98                  1.6  cooperatives   other nonstate        0.944             118                 3.1  forms      The volume of commodity stocks in retail trade as of the  beginning of April amounted to 44 days of trade (as of the same  time in 1993--41 days). In enterprises of the state form of  ownership, trade turnover stocks were on hand for 53 days of  trade, in private enterprises--35 days, consumer  cooperatives--56 days, and in other nonstate forms of  enterprises--44 days of trade.    MONETARY INCOME AND OUTLAYS OF THE POPULACE. Monetary income  received by the populace in the first quarter of this year  amounted to R53.8 trillion. Some R31.5 trillion of this figure  was money taken into account as wages of workers at enterprises,  institutions, and organizations; R8.5 trillion--pensions,  allowances, stipends, and other social monetary transfers; R13.8  trillion--income to the populace for entrepreneurial activity,  participation in the profits of enterprises and organizations,  transactions involving real property, and other financial and  credit transactions. The share of wages within the monetary  income structure decreased, as compared with the same period of  1993, from 65 percent in the first quarter of 1993 to 59 percent  in the first quarter of this year, while a corresponding  increase was seen in the proportion of entrepreneurial income.  The share of social transfers remained at approximately the same  level--16 percent.    Face-value monetary income of the populace in January-March  of this year increased over January-March 1993 levels by a  factor of 8.8. Its growth outpaced the rise in consumer market  prices over this quarter by a factor of 8.0. Thus, real  disposable monetary income (income after the withholding of  mandatory payments and with index adjustment) increased by  approximately 10 percent. In this regard, that portion of the  population with the highest incomes saw an increase 1.2 times  greater than did the populace with lowest incomes.    As compared with the first quarter of 1992, real disposable  monetary income of the populace increased by 25.5 percent.  However, this growth did not replenish its decline seen during  the first year of liberalization of prices. As compared with the  first quarter of 1991, the level of this income was 40 percent  lower.    The population having income lower than the subsistence  minimum numbered 25.2 million in first quarter of this year, or  17.0 percent, as opposed to 51.7 million (34.7 percent) in the  first quarter of 1993.    The role of hard-currency purchases and acquisition of  securities continued to grow within the structure of use of  monetary income of the populace, while expenditures for  consumption purposes and cash on hand decreased.

DELINQUENT INDEBTEDNESS IN ISSUING FUNDS FOR WAGES AND OTHER  PAYMENTS TO ENTERPRISE WORKERS. Delinquent indebtedness in the  issue of funds for wages and other payments to the workers of  industrial enterprises and organizations, construction and  agricultural enterprises (not including funds transferred to the  bank accounts of workers) increased by 20 percent in March. The  following table reflects data on the numbers of enterprises  having delinquent indebtedness with respect to wages and the  volume of this indebtedness.                             As of 1 March    As of 1 April    As of 1 April 93                           94               94               (reference)   Number of enterprises    35,031           32,617           14,124  with indebtedness  respecting issue of  funds for consumption  (units)--total   including:   in industry              8,275            6,995            3,587   in construction          7,409            6,230            3,304   in agriculture           19,347           19,392           7,233   Volume of delinquent indebtedness in the issue of consumption funds to  enterprise workers (trillion rubles)   total                    1.9785           2.3741           0.0643   including:   in industry              1.0442           1.3325           0.0348   in construction          0.3714           0.4171           0.0135   in agriculture           0.5629           0.6245           0.0160   Funds directed (credited) towards consumption for workers of enterprises and  organizations over the accounting month (trillion rubles)   total                    1.6093           1.8347           0.1023   including:   in industry              1.0205           1.2283           0.0614   in construction          0.2745           0.2891           0.0209   in agriculture           0.3143           0.3173           0.0200      Indebtedness of longer than one month in the issue of wage  funds as of 1 April 1994 in the three sectors of the economy  totalled R1.0847 trillion, or 46 percent of the total  indebtedness volume, including R508.3 billion (38 percent) in  industry, R195.7 billion (47 percent) in construction, and  R380.7 billion (61 percent) in agriculture.    The greatest amounts of funds not paid within the prescribed  time frames are attributable to enterprises and organizations of  industry, construction, and agriculture in Tyumen Oblast (R232.8  billion), Krasnoyarsk Kray (R131.5 billion), Kemerovo Oblast  (R118.4 billion), Chelyabinsk Oblast (R87.7 billion), the  Republic of Bashkiria (R67.6 billion), Rostov Oblast (R66.6  billion), Perm Oblast (R64.0 billion), the Komi Republic (R63.2  billion), Tatar Republic (R59.8 billion), Irkutsk Oblast (R57.9  billion), and Altay Kray (R52.3 billion).    STATE OF PAYMENTS DISCIPLINE. The credit indebtedness of  surveyed industrial and agricultural enterprises, construction  and transportation organizations, amounted to R63 trillion as of  1 March of this year. Of this amount, R25 trillion, or 39  percent, constituted delinquent indebtedness (as of 1 February  these figures were R54 trillion, R20 trillion, and 37 percent).  The proportion of total delinquent credit indebtedness of these  sectors that was owed to suppliers constituted 70 percent (R17  trillion), owed to the budget--17 percent (R4 trillion).    The largest share of delinquent credit indebtedness was seen  in the microbiology industry and ferrous metallurgy (46  percent), in the timber, woodworking, and pulp and paper  industry, chemical and petrochemical industry, and nonferrous  metallurgy (47 percent), in the coal industry (48 percent), and  gas industry (68 percent).    The following table shows the dynamics of delinquent credit  indebtedness for February:    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                                      |1 March 94 percentage of 1 February 94|  |                                      | level                                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Rate of growth of delinquent credit i-|125.8                                 |  |ndebtedness--total                    |                                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |including:                                                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |industry                              |124.0                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |construction                          |135.6                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |agriculture                           |139.3                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |transportation                        |127.0                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      A significant increase was seen in delinquent credit  indebtedness in February 1994 at enterprises in the construction  (36 percent), transportation (39 percent), ferrous metallurgy  (36 percent), flour and cereal grinding, mixed fodders (38  percent), peat (46 percent), coal (50 percent), electric power  (52 percent), and gas industries (82 percent).    The share of enterprises having delinquent credit  indebtedness as of 1 March 1994 amounted to 50.2 percent, as  opposed to 46.6 percent as of 1 February 1994.    As of 1 March of this year, the total amount of debts  receivable reached R60 trillion, of which R26 trillion, or 43  percent, constituted delinquent debts (figures as of 1  February--R50 trillion, R21 trillion, 43 percent). In this  regard, R23 trillion, or 90 percent of the total amount of such  delinquent debt, was attributable to delinquent indebtedness for  unloaded output, work performed, and services rendered.    The largest portion of delinquent debts receivable was  observed in the electric power industry, building materials  industry, timber, woodworking, and pulp and paper industry (49  percent), ferrous metallurgy and the coal industry (53 percent),  nonferrous metallurgy and the peat industry (54 percent), and  the gas industry (71 percent).    Nonpayments among enterprises are holding back revenue  payments to the budget. Indebtedness to the budget on the part  of enterprises and organizations of industry, construction,  agriculture, and transportation amounted to R9 trillion, of  which R4 trillion, or 46 percent, constituted delinquent  indebtedness (these figures as of 1 February--R8 trillion, R3  trillion, 43 percent).    A significant share of delinquent indebtedness to the budget  was observed in the oil industry (56 percent), coal industry and  ferrous metallurgy (61 percent), and in construction (52  percent).    Due to shortages of their own funds, enterprises were forced  to take out loans. The indebtedness from bank credits afforded  enterprises and organizations of the sectors under examination  amounted to R13 trillion, of which R2 trillion, or 12 percent,  constituted delinquent indebtedness.    The significant volume of nonpayments has exerted an  influence on the financial stability of enterprises and  organizations, on their solvency.    The following table reflects the dynamics of the correlation  between monetary assets and delinquent indebtedness to suppliers  in industry and construction in 1993 and 1994 (solvency):                        Percentage as of the beginning of the month   1 January 93        1       1          1          1           1                      July    October    January    February    March                      93      93         94         94          94   Monetary assets     78.2    119.6      75.0       49.9        41.2     39.2  as percentage of  delinquent  indebtedness to  suppliers--total   including:   industry            79.3    124.6      76.9       50.7        42.6     41.6   construction        67.2    67.4       55.4       41.7        21.4     17.6      During the first half of 1993, monetary assets exceeded  delinquent indebtedness to suppliers. By the end of 1993 they  covered half this amount, and by the end of first quarter 1994,  to the level of just 39 percent.    At enterprises of the flour and cereal grinding industry,  mixed fodders, coal, microbiology, gas, chemical, and  petrochemical industries, monetary assets covered delinquent  indebtedness only to the extent of 11-16 percent.    PRODUCTION OF GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT. Gross domestic product  (GDP), characterizing the cost of production, work, and services  intended for final consumption, accumulation, and export,  amounted to R96.9 trillion over the three months of this year.  As compared with the same period of last year, the physical  volume of GDP decreased 17 percent. The more significant  reductions in this regard were seen in the sphere of commodity  output:                           Gross added value     Percentage of      Change in                         for January-March     total              physical                         1994, trillion                           volume                         rubles                                   compared with                                                                  the same                                                                  period of last                                                                  year, percent   GDP produced, total    96.9                  100                83.0   including:   commodity production   42.8                  44.2               79.4    including:   commodities in         26.0                  26.8               75.1  industry   commodities in         6.2                   6.4                76.0  construction   commodities in         10.5                  10.8               94.5  agriculture   performance of         46.3                  47.8               88.1  services   including:   market services        35.3                  36.4               85.0   including:   in transportation      23.3                  24.0               75.9   in trade               3.4                   3.5                101.2   nonmarket services     11.0                  11.4               95.9   net taxes (minus       7.8                   8.0                84.4  subsidies) on  commodities and  imports      A sharp reduction was seen in the first quarter of this year  (as compared with the same period of 1993) in the volume of  industrial production output (25-percent drop) and construction  work (24 percent). This led to a corresponding drop in  value-added in these sectors, as well as in the net taxes on  commodities (excise taxes, value-added tax) taken into account  in the GDP. At the same time, the performance of services  decreased at a significantly slower rate. In certain sectors,  the volume of services performed even continues to rise.    As a result, the share of services--primarily market  services--in the GDP structure continued to increase, especially  noticeably in those sectors engaged in intermediary and  financial transactions. The percentage of value added in sectors  performing services increased in the first quarter of 1994 to  47.8 percent of the GDP (including 36.4 percent attributable to  market services, 11.4 percent to nonmarket services), as opposed  to 34.8 percent of the GDP for the same period of 1993, where  25.1 percent were market and 9.7 percent nonmarket services.    The increased share of GDP volume attributable to services  is  also related to a somewhat greater increase in prices and rates  in these sectors. Thus in the first quarter of this year, the  GDP deflation index was a factor of 7.5, while prices and rates  for market and nonmarket services increased by a factor of 9-10.    CONSTRUCTION OF RESIDENTIAL HOUSING FACILITIES. The volume  of  capital investments in nonproduction construction decreased 11  percent in the first quarter of 1994 from the level of the same  period last year. The reduction in commissioning of main  facilities is shown as follows:                                Commissioned in      Percentage of January-March                              January-March 1994    1993                        1990   Housing--square meters of   4.0 million          95             50  living space   General education           9,000                48             39  schools--student spaces   Preschool                   2,600                40             14  institutions--spaces   Hospitals--beds             1,700                80             99.2   Walk-in clinics--visits     2,000                37             19  per shift      Some 59 percent of the total volume of housing was  commissioned by enterprises and organizations of state and mixed  Russian ownership, 16 percent--of municipal ownership. More than  one-fourth of the housing, or a million square meters, was  constructed by private owners. This is 9 percent greater than  the level for the same period of last year. Of this amount,  668,000 square meters (27 percent more) was the effort of  individual builders, their proportion of the total volume  increasing from 13.3 percent in 1993 to 16.9 percent at the  beginning of this year.    Military servicemen and their family members obtained more  than 5,500 apartments during the period since the beginning of  the year, totalling 300,000 square meters of living space. It is  expected these individuals will be afforded 60,000-100,000  apartments in 1994.    STRIKES. The beginning of 1994 was characterized by  increased  strike activity on the part of laborers. In the first quarter,  strikes took place at 288 enterprises, exceeding the number of  enterprises at which strikes were conducted over the entire  previous year by 24. More than 80 percent of the strikes took  place in March.    Enterprises cited delay in the payment of wages as the  foremost reason behind the conduct of strikes in all sectors.  The number of enterprises in industry failing to pay timely  wages to their workers in March almost doubled as compared with  the beginning of the year. Among the other reasons for  conducting strikes enterprises cited failure to comply with  wage-scale agreements, and budget indebtedness for the financing  of scientific research and preventive repair work, provision of  technical equipment, acquisition of medical and school  equipment, etc.    The following table provides data on strikes conducted in  sectors of the economy in January-March 1993 and 1994:                      Number of            Number of             Losses in labor                    enterprises at       participants          time, man-days                    which strikes were                    conducted   1993              1994      1993      1994       1993       1994   Total             29        288       18,200     114,500    34,200    283,100   In industry       28        137       17,900     87,400     33,200    168,600   including:   Fuel industry     27        135       17,500     87,000     30,300    167,100   Education         --        137       --         24,700     --        107,200   Construction      --        7         --         1,300      --        4,700   Transportation    1         4         300        700        1,000     2,000  and  communications   Other sectors     --        3         --         400        --        600      As a result of strikes over the period which transpired,  enterprises estimate that production output totalling R8.8  billion overall was not produced. Of this amount, R8.2 billion  was attributable to the fuel and energy complex. As a result of  the deliberate cessation of operations, 88 enterprises of the  country failed to receive production output deliveries according  to contract in an amount totalling more than R3.5 billion.    The greatest losses from the strikes were suffered by  enterprises of the fuel and energy complex in the Komi Republic  (R2.4 billion), Kemerovo Oblast (R2.3 billion), Rostov Oblast  (R2.1 billion), and Tula Oblast (R0.2 billion). Strikes by coal  miners in Perm and Chelyabinsk Oblasts are continuing.</p>

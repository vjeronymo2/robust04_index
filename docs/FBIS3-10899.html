			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In a widely expected move the General Labour  Confederation's [CGT] extraordinary congress yesterday [10  March] elected SUPE [United Trade Union of State Petroleum  Workers] petrol workers union leader Alberto Cassia as new  secretary-general.    The CGT also chose new members to its Directive Council,  which is dominated by pro-government unions and is expected to  continue its negotiations with the Justicialist administration.    "It is not time to throw stones or make strikes, and we will  favour dialogue over all things," 55-year-old Alberto Cassia  said after being sworn in as CGT head. Cassia, a former deputy,  has lead the union in Mendoza and has close ties with ex-SUPE  head Diego Ibanez, who is a close friend of President Carlos  Menem's. Cassia has also had a place as a workers representative  on the state oil company YPF's [Government Oil Deposits] board  of directors.    The new leadership does not include any members of either  the  breakaway Argentine Workers Movement or the anti-government  Argentine Workers Congress. Neither group attended the gathering  staged in the Federal Capital at the Parque Norte sports centre.    Luis Barrionuevo, the UTGRA [Argentine Union of Restaurant  Workers] restaurant workers union leader, is another prominent  unionist that does not have a place on the new Directive Council.    AB [Banking Association] bank clerks union leader Juan Jose  Zanola is the CGT's joint secretary general. The other 22 places  on the council are shared among members of the staunch  pro-government union and the moderate pro-government unions that  negotiated Cassia's candidacy prior to the Congress.    The powerful UOM [Metalworkers Union] metal workers union  significantly has chosen to keep its participation in the new  CGT at a minimum: La Matanza UOM leader Carlos Gdansky was  appointed to the minor post of register secretary.    UOM metal workers union leader Lorenzo Miguel said that  "although we are friends of the President (Carlos Menem) we are  independent enough to defend the rights of the workers."    Cassia, in turn, said that he will immediately request a  meeting with Menem and Labour Minister Armando Caro Figueroa.    "(The CGT), shares the socio-economic model of Carlos  Menem's  government with the logical disagreements that organized labour  has with certain official plans that affect workers rights,"  Cassia told a local news agency. He added that the CGT "will, if  necessary, use the right to strike."    Organizers said that 1,186 delegates of 171 trade unions  participated in the Congress in which the only ticket presented  was the one headed by Cassia.

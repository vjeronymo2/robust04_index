			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / People: Attacked by 'party of war' - Vladimir Gusinsky fears Russia is swinging right Most,' says Vladimir Gusinsky, 'is a test case - of whether or not there can be civil society here, a development of democracy and of a business culture.' Founded in October 1991 by Gusinsky, its president, the Most group includes a bank, investment and construction interests and, most controversially, media interests: the Sevodnya daily newspaper, the Echo radio station and NTV, a TV channel. Most's backing has given Sevodnya, NTV and Echo a financial independence which is unique in the Russian media, and they have capitalised on it to become the Kremlin's most outspoken liberal critics. Over the past 10 days, the state has struck back: Gusinsky's bodyguards were brutally and publicly beaten by President Yeltsin's personal security forces and border guards sought to detain Gusinsky when he left for a weekend in London. Gusinsky fears that the government attacks on Most are part of a more general swing to the right. 'Russia today is at the crossroads,' he says. 'We have a party of war and a party of peace, and it is not clear who will win.' It is the party of war, Gusinsky believes, which was behind the recent attacks on Most. The war party won another victory yesterday, when Moscow unleashed its army against the break-away Chechen republic. His media interests have been fiercely opposed to fighting a war in Chechnya and Gusinsky warned over the weekend that: 'You cannot win in Chechnya without killing every man, woman and child. If we start a war there we might end up killing democracy in Russia.' It is a dramatic warning, from a businessman with the flair of the theatrical director he trained to be. Where many of the new private business people practice discretion, he appears to say what he thinks. In a country where most Jews still play down their ethnicity, he mentions his own Jewishness naturally. Where links between business and politics are mostly subterranean, his closeness to Yuri Luzhkov, the Moscow mayor, is treated as a public issue (his bank has a large part of the Moscow city account) - though how far each benefits from the patronage of the other is unknown and unsaid. Ten days ago, Gusinsky learned that, in Russia, prominence still has a high price. Early in the day, armed men in paramilitary gear, but with no distinguishing badges, appeared at his dacha, in the elite Uspenskoye area just outside of Moscow. At mid-morning they went to his office and asked his guards questions. At around five o'clock, as tension grew, the unidentified paramilitaries seized some of the Gusinsky's bodyguards and drivers, forcing them to lie face down on the snow covered ground for two hours.  Ivan Latvinenko, head of the Bank's security, was so badly injured he was sent to hospital. Gusinsky called Yevgeny Sevostyanov, head of the Federal Counter-Intelligence Service for Moscow. Sevostyanov sent his officers and learned that the unidentified paramilitaries were members of the presidential guard. Their commander is General Alexander Korzhakov, a man who, on President Boris Yeltsin's own admission, is one of his closest confidantes. Within hours of this identification, Sevostyanov was fired - a result, he has since said, of naming the 'guilty men'. The presidential guard later said it was their duty to arrest 'unidentified armed men' on President Yeltsin's normal route to work. Gusinsky says he has been travelling that busy road, with an armed bodyguard, for over a year. President Yeltsin has expressed regret about the incident. But Gusinsky's fellow bankers have protested vigorously. Says a fellow banker, a friend and admirer of Gusinsky's: 'Volodya (Vladimir) was taught who's boss.' In his office on Friday, his usual bubbly jokiness gone, Gusinsky said: 'It is on a knife edge, whether it gets worse and whether we are under even greater threat.' Most is already hyper-careful over security. It has some 3,000 men under arms, many working as guards for the bank's branches, and in some cases big clients. But Gusinsky has been advised to take even more care. Flying to London, he eschewed his own aircraft in favour of British Airways, but expressed fears that even a commercial flight might not be safe. At Sheremtyevo in Moscow airport on Friday night, border guards initially forbade him from leaving the country - a ban that was only lifted after his colleagues contacted the president's office. Gusinsky is deeply worried. He believes next year will be the most dangerous facing Russia since the collapse of the Soviet Union. 'People again fear to speak out, to be identified, to cross the president. It goes back to our past. The country has to make a choice, whether to live freely, or to lose that freedom.' He does not blame President Yeltsin for the attack on Most, but says the course Russia will take 'all depends on the president. He has so much power now, concentrated in his hands.' The security guards affair was, he says, an attack on Most and its media interests, although he insists 'we are interested in the mass media, because we are interested in making money from it. We have no particular policy. We are against communism and against fascism, that's about it.' This is disingenuous. His paper, his radio station and his TV channel are liberal - in the Russian context, very liberal. Their views cannot be choked off by being deprived of funds. Gusinsky has done nothing by halves. The party last month to celebrate Most group's third anniversary took over the public rooms in Moscow's grandest hotel, the Metropole. His headquarters are in the middle of political Moscow, inside city hall. The director of his small private army is General Bobkov, formerly the head of the KGB's fifth directorate, which dealt with, among other things, dissidents. This appointment has earned Gusinsky much criticism. Most's KGB connections were the subject of a fiercely critical article in the Wall Street Journal. Gusinsky is taking legal action over the story. Gusinsky has close business connections with Moscow's mayor Luzhkov, a powerful, domineering figure, and one increasingly spoken of as a presidential contender. Gusinsky's describes him as 'a personal friend.' Their links have inspired allegations of corruption, though none have ever been proven. Most observers believe the attack on Most was meant to cut Gusinsky down to size and warn Luzhkov off standing in presidential elections, due in 18 months. Above all, Gusinsky has learned again - as he must have already known - that business is inseparable from politics. All he can do is hope he can save himself from being a political victim. To be a political innocent is not a choice.</p>

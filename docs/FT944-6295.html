			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (News and Analysis): Something for everybody and no harm done - Birmingham West Midlands manufacturers gathered round the tea table in Birmingham heard the chancellor out in silence. No exclamations of disgust, no chortles of approbation. 'Our attitude summarises the effect he's likely to have,' said Mr Albert Hargreaves, chairman of Apollo Metals, the aluminium processor and distributor. Mr Rod Turner, managing director designate of Whale Tankers, maker of waste disposal vehicles, said: 'My overall impression was that it was a politician's gem of a budget: bits of something for everybody.' 'Nobody is violently outraged,' added Mr Jim Mundell, chairman of Woodcote Industries, which manufactures forged components. 'The best thing for me was the start on trying to reform the welfare system to encourage the unemployed to seek work,' according to Mr Ed Kirk, the chairman of Frederick Cooper, the metals finishing and architectural products company. 'It should help companies like mine which are finding it difficult to fill the lower paid jobs,' he added. The issue here for the manufacturers was not whether they would receive tax breaks. 'I don't think it's a question for the company. It's the incentive for the individual - that's where the incentive should go. You've got to have a better choice from the people available on the labour market. It's a very important initiative,' Mr Mundell said of the chancellor's job creation package. 'Imaginative,' agreed Mr Turner. 'I don't think it would give any employer the incentive to take anybody on,' said Mr Hargreaves. That might not please the chancellor. What would please him was the general approval of his stance on corporate taxation and his rejection of the demands from the CBI, the Engineering Employers Federation and the Chambers of Commerce for changes in capital allowances. Anticipating today's recriminations, Mr Mundell dismissed such demands as 'part of the feel good factor - people holding off to see what improvement there's going to be'. Mr Kirk agreed. 'I wouldn't invest any money just because there's an allowance,' he said. Mr Turner added: 'Anyway, it's driven by the leasing companies. And the banks. They're the players in there.' Mr Mundell said: 'There's been no investment in drop forging for 50 years. You've really got to start again. The only way to re-equip is an industry aid scheme.' Pinioned between rising costs, like raw materials, which they have to absorb, and downward pressure from their customers, the manufacturers listened closely to what Mr Clarke said about inflation. Mr Turner, sensing there was some sleight of hand in the calculation, said: 'One of the things that is disappointing - a target of 1 to 4 per cent for inflation is pretty broad.' 'If they want to survive they've probably got to see the 4 rather than the 1,' Mr Mundell suggested, concerned about people's expectations of rising wages and house prices. Not that there is wage pressure at the moment. 'We have an American business and they're not used to getting pay rises,' commented Mr Kirk. 'That's right. People get used to it,' said Mr Turner. 'I can't see a lot of wage inflation coming,' Mr Kirk came back. Mr Hargreaves has, however, seen the first signs. 'As you see people like Jaguar and Rover raising their rates, we're seeing people moving on.' 'We have that problem but at the moment we can keep pulling people in,' said Mr Kirk. 'That's all right if you haven't got 25 jobs you want to fill,' rejoined Mr Hargreaves. For Mr Kirk, the way to avoid cost pressures is to increase volumes. That means, under current domestic conditions, the export markets. So Mr Clarke got a pat on the back for reducing export guarantee premiums. And the manufacturers went away into the gloom of the afternoon. 'No harm done,' said Mr Mundell.</p>

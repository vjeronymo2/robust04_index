			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: UK equities The market's reaction to yesterday's third-quarter figures from Unilever was typical of the current reporting season. Although the figures were at the top end of City forecasts the shares slipped slightly on the news. Most other UK companies reporting this week also lived up to expectations, but only British Airways received much immediate reward in its share price. In terms of earnings forecasts, analysts' upgrades continue to outweigh downgrades by about two to one and, while British Telecom's dividend was slightly disappointing, Northumbrian Water braved the political backlash by increasing its payment by 16 per cent. The good prospects for earnings and dividends make the UK market look fairly attractive: shares are on an end-1995 price earnings ratio of around 13.5 and a prospective yield of over 4.5 per cent. Yet in spite of this healthy background, equities finished the week down almost 1 per cent. One problem was that shares received no support from gilts which could not shake off the downbeat mood in US Treasuries. Here all eyes are on Tuesday's federal open market committee meeting with the markets waiting, in both fear and hope, for a half-point rise in US interest rates. Such a move should at least stabilise Treasuries and might also support a long-awaited turning point for the dollar. Given the better inflation outlook in the UK gilts should then continue to outperform, allowing shares to rise in their wake. But it would be no surprise if investors sit on their hands until after the Budget.</p>

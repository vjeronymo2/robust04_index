			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Ciskei 'homeland' leaders cede power amid widespread unrest The government of Ciskei, a nominally independent black homeland in South Africa, last night relinquished power after widespread unrest. In the Lebowa black homeland, the chief minister also requested assistance from Pretoria after a civil servants' strike made it impossible to keep control. South African troops moved into Ciskei after homeland police took senior officers hostage claiming they had been involved in corruption. South Africa's Foreign Affairs Ministry said Ciskei leader Brigadier Oupa Gqozo requested assistance from Pretoria. In a statement, the ministry said: 'Brigadier Gqozo telephoned to say the situation was out of hand and there was danger of large-scale conflict and bloodshed. He indicated he had come to the conclusion he ought to relinquish power in an attempt to reduce the ongoing tension.' The multi-party Transitional Executive Council said last night that two administrators - one from the TEC and one from the South Africa government - would administer the Ciskei until April's elections. Three of South Africa's 10 homelands - including Bophuthatswana, whose government fell earlier this month - have now been removed from power. The news from Ciskei and Lebowa will substantially increase pressure on the KwaZulu homeland. Zulu chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, who heads the KwaZulu homeland, yesterday claimed he had a secret African National Congress document that showed the ANC also planned to topple him from power. Also yesterday, a multi-party task force set up by the TEC said it had uncovered evidence linking so-called 'hit squads' operating in Natal province to the office of Chief Buthelezi. Inkatha is not represented on the TEC, which is dominated by the ANC. The taskforce findings will further damage Inkatha's credibility following allegations that South African police generals gave guns to the party.</p>

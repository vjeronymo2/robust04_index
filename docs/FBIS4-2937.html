			<p>BFN     [Text] Fuzhou, April 13 (CNS) -- Vice Director of the  Fujian Tourism Bureau Mr. Luo Jian said that the unfortunate  accident at Qiandao Lake affected provincial tourism to a  certain extent, but he believed that this would be temporary and  that the development of tourism between Fujian and Taiwan would  prove beneficial to both sides.    Mr. Luo Jian said that Fujian had rich tourism resources and  was the main place of origin of Taiwan compatriots. Since 1987,  more and more Taiwan compatriots had come to Fujian to visit  their ancestral homes and resorts and to make religious and  business trips. According to statistics, the province had  received some 340,000 Taiwan compatriots last year, the most  since the 90's had begun.    Mr. Luo said that the tourism departments in Fujian and  Taiwan had coordinated with each other in giving services to  Taiwan compatriots and in recent years such cooperation had not  only boosted the development of Fujian tourism but also that of  Taiwan. Artificial blocks stopping Taiwan compatriots from  travelling to the Mainland would benefit neither side.    Fujian's tourism facilities had improved, with its present  foreign-related 100 hotels, 50 of which were star-grade as well  as 14,000 standard rooms and nearly 30,000 beds to basically  meet the demands of overseas visitors.    Mr. Luo also said that the provincial tourism departments  had  been emphasizing travel safety and had enacted a set of  management regulations. These departments conducted safety  inspections of various tourism services every year and trained  employees to guarantee safety measures. Even if an individual  accident occurred, Mr. Luo, added, the departments would handle  it with the utmost efficiency.</p>

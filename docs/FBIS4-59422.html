			<p>BFN     [Text] It was decided at a discussion in the prime  minister's bureau that the Civil Administration will pay the  Gaza Strip's debt of approximately 37 million shekels to the  Electricity Corporation. Israel will propose that, in the  future, the Palestinians make monthly payments of approximately  6-8 million shekels for their electricity consumption, and if  they should be unable to pay, the sums will be deducted from  other budgets earmarked for the autonomy.    In the wake of this decision, the Electricity Corporation  has  announced that it will not disconnect the power supply to the  Gaza Strip as planned. This was reported by our correspondents  Shlomo Raz and Shulamit Schmerling. Under the Israel-PLO  agreement, the Gaza Strip is to receive electricity from Israel  on an economic-commercial basis whose details will be finalized  in negotiations.</p>

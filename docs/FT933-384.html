			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Restructuring at Sears begins to bear fruit SEARS yesterday showed the first fruits of the restructuring begun by Mr Liam Strong, the new chief executive, with increases in trading profits in three of its four main divisions. Although the exceptional items that have been a feature of Sears' results since Mr Strong took over were still in evidence, once these were removed trading profits from ongoing businesses increased 26 per cent to Pounds 37.6m. Much of the increase came from the footwear division - British Shoe Corporation - which has been the focus of Mr Strong's efforts, and transformed a Pounds 2.5m loss into a Pounds 9m profit. BSC increased sales by only 2 per cent overall, to Pounds 253.4m. But as it closed 88 shops and 54 concessions - the equivalent of 10 per cent of floorspace, like-for-like sales actually increased by 7 per cent. At the lower end of the market, the group is now concentrating on rolling out its successful Shoe Express chain, which will add 25 stores by Christmas, and 200 by the end of 1994. It also plans to expand the Hush Puppies chain, which Mr Strong says has 'useful potential' as a mid-market chain. Sales in the home shopping division fell 6 per cent to Pounds 249.1m, but trading profit increased 20 per cent to Pounds 14.9m, reflecting the policy of enhancing margins and reducing discounting. Costs have also been cut by reducing the workforce by 300. However, closure of the loss-making ter Meulen Post, the Dutch mail order business, resulted in a Pounds 5.5m exceptional charge. Selfridges, the Oxford Street department store, increased sales by 2 per cent to Pounds 96.3m, but lifted profits almost 10 per cent to Pounds 6m, again thanks to improved margins and product mix, and a multi-million pound revamp of the store. The high street fashion division was the only one to show a fall in trading profits, from Pounds 7m to Pounds 4.8m, although sales increased 23 per cent. Richards, the womens' wear business acquired from Storehouse last October, was responsible for much of the increase in sales, and for the fall in profits. Mr Strong said Richards had performed badly because it had taken time to clear old stock, but he was confident the business would make money in the second half - although he was uncertain whether this would be enough to offset losses in the first half. He said the other high street chains, which include Miss Selfridge, Wallis, and Warehouse, had performed well. Adams, the childrens' wear retailer, had held profits in a tough market, and Olympus Sports had cut its losses. Sears is in talks with Sports Authority of the US, part of the K mart group, on possible co-operation in opening out-of-town sports superstores.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Over the past few years, much interest has been expressed by mortgagors and real estate agents in a transaction known as the ``pre-foreclosure sale.'' In a successful pre-foreclosure sale, neither foreclosure nor conveyance of the property to the Department occur. A third party buys the home from a defaulting mortgagor at its approximate fair market value (with certain adjustments, as approved by the Secretary), which is less than the owner's outstanding indebtedness at the time of sale.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1064 of the McKinney Homeless Assistance Amendments Act of 1988 (Pub. L. 100&hyph;628) amended section 204(a) of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1710(a)) to authorize HUD to pay a claim to a lender equal to the difference between the fair market sale price and the outstanding indebtedness (with certain adjustments). A successfully completed pre-foreclosure sale benefits the mortgagor, who avoids the stigma of foreclosure on his or her credit record, and also benefits HUD, which can expect to save by not paying foreclosure-related costs. HUD also saves on maintenance costs and marketing expenses for properties which would otherwise be conveyed to the Department following foreclosure. Finally, mortgagees also benefit through incorporating this loss-mitigation technique into their overall loan servicing, by frequently being able to file their claim for insurance benefits sooner, following a successful pre-foreclosure sale, than they would following a post-foreclosure conveyance claim.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On May 29, 1991, the Department published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , at 56 FR 24324, a notice which announced a limited demonstration program to gauge the demand for, and the efficacy of, pre-foreclosure sales as a means of assisting qualified mortgagors in avoiding foreclosure of their FHA-insured mortgages and of saving the Department money.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department has decided to implement the pre-foreclosure sale procedure nationwide by incorporating it into the overall approach of servicing FHA-insured loans by FHA-approved lender/servicers. The Demonstration now concluding has been successful in that the demand for this alternative to foreclosure was found to be very substantial; the efficacy of the pre-foreclosure sale transaction was found to be cost-beneficial to HUD; and feedback obtained from participating local HUD offices, program coordinators, mortgagees, homeowners and the general public, was quite favorable. By expanding the options available to financially distressed mortgagors and not adversely affecting any mortgagor rights or interests under existing FHA-insured loan servicing regulations, the Department has not only acted responsibly toward the homeowners with FHA-insured mortgages, but also has operated with an eye to the cost-effectiveness of its own policies and procedures. This interim rule will make pre-foreclosure sales an even more efficient servicing tool by streamlining procedures and, in some respects, reducing the Department's cost of following this course of action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Among the regulatory changes being implemented is a new &sect;203.370, which provides for the payment of FHA insurance benefits to mortgagees upon the filing of claims following successful pre-foreclosure sales. (It also contains notification and eligibility provisions, noted below.) Other sections governing claim submission, calculation and payment_24 CFR 200.155, 203.360, 203.365, 203.401, 203.402, 203.403, and 203.410_are being amended to recognize the possibility of a pre-foreclosure sale as an outcome of the servicing of a defaulted mortgage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Public Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The public was given 60 days to comment on the requirements and procedures set forth in the May 29, 1991 notice that established the Pre-Foreclosure Sale Demonstration discussed above. Comments were received from 22 commenters: 12 mortgagees/servicers, three counseling agencies, two real estate service companies, one national association of real estate sales professionals, one quasi-governmental organization, one financial services company, one local HUD office, and one individual. Below is a listing of the comments received and the Department's responses to those comments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. With the exception of one mortgagee, all other comments had at least some positive aspects and were supportive of the fact that HUD was engaging in an effort to mitigate losses through pre-foreclosure sales. Typically, commenters believed that PFS was ``overdue,'' ``a much needed program,'' ``an attractive alternative to loan foreclosure,'' and that the ``program nationwide should help reduce foreclosures and encourage sales where the market is not strong.'' [two mortgage servicers, one real estate service company, one national association of real estate sales professionals]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It is because of the overall response of this nature that the Department has decided to implement the pre-foreclosure sale procedure nationwide.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Seven commenters stressed the need for trained, proficient professionals to be involved in PFS; e.g., contractors, program administrators, local HUD staff, or HUD Headquarters staff overseeing the Demonstration. [one national association of real estate sales professionals, two real estate service companies, four mortgagees]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It has come to HUD's attention that a number of mortgagees have added, or otherwise identified, loss-mitigation teams to their respective servicing staffs, in an effort to improve the responsiveness to mortgagor defaults and to apply alternatives to foreclosure where feasible and cost-beneficial. HUD applauds and encourages these efforts; they comport with the Department's own evolving philosophy regarding foreclosure avoidance and with expanding concepts of ``prudent mortgage servicing'' and ``protecting HUD's interests.'' The Department expects that the benefits of such an approach will be marked and far-reaching, extending not only to HUD, but also to homeowners and mortgagees. In particular, the move to increase the mortgagees' role in HUD's pre-foreclosure sale procedure is being taken to utilize the mortgagees' growing ability to manage or mitigate loss in a responsible fashion. HUD will provide sufficient information and/or training to its own staff involved in pre-foreclosure sales to enable them to make prudent decisions and to disseminate accurate details about the PFS procedure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> June 22, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> DANGEROUS, HUNGRY 10-FOOT BOA ON LOOSE  </P> <P> A 10-foot, 45-pound Colombian boa constrictor named Lucifer remained loose  Wednesday in Boise after it slithered out of the front door of a house on  Sunday when its owner was napping, officials said.  </P> <P> As police officers searched for the snake, the owner warned that the 5-year-old  female reptile was a threat to small children and animals. "I feed her every  Sunday, but she hadn't been fed before she left, so she's hungry," said Snow  Collett, 20. The snake's diet consists of pigeons, chickens and rats, she said,  but it has been known to attack people. The boa squeezes its prey to death.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 3, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCIENCE / LOCOMOTION;  </P> <P> LEGS KNOCKED OUT FROM UNDER THEORY ON WHY SNAKES EVOLVED  </P> <P> Snakes wearing tiny oxygen masks while slithering on treadmills at UC Irvine  apparently have refuted some conventional wisdom about evolution.  </P> <P> Scientists measuring the amount of oxygen consumed by the snakes have concluded  that, contrary to earlier predictions, limbless locomotion does not conserve  energy. The research suggests that snakes spend at least as much energy moving  -- and in some cases, much more -- as legged animals of similar size.  </P> <P> "It's long been an evolutionary puzzle why many vertebrates lost limbs  entirely," said Bruce Jayne, an evolutionary biologist at UC Irvine and  co-author of the research in the journal Science. "The suggestion that the loss  of limbs conveys an energetic advantage for locomotion is not the case at all,"  he explained.  </P> <P> In 1973, a Harvard University study found that garter snakes consumed 30% of  the energy of legged lizards moving the same distance. The preliminary study  was never published, but was regularly cited in scientific articles and  textbooks to explain that snakes and certain species of legless salamanders and  lizards evolved as energy-conserving creatures.  </P> <P> To determine the energy expenditure required for movement, the California  researchers placed tiny oxygen masks on black racer snakes of the species  Coluber constrictor. The snakes were then put on custom-designed motorized  treadmills and the scientists recorded oxygen consumption, speed and endurance  during two types of locomotion.  </P> <P> During lateral undulation, a snake slithers back and forth along the ground by  moving its entire body simultaneously at the same speed. But when confronted  with passage through a narrow tunnel, snakes change their strategy for  locomotion. Using concertina locomotion, a snake bunches up its body and then  extends its head forward while the rear portion of the body remains still. Then  the snake bunches up the front section of its body and pulls its rear section  forward.  </P> <P> Snakes moving by lateral undulation used virtually the same energy as that of  limbed lizards of identical size, the researchers noted. Moreover, the energy  the snakes spent was also similar to that predicted for birds and mammals of  the same weight.  </P> <P> In contrast, snakes moving by concertina locomotion required seven times the  energy to move the same distance as during lateral undulation, Jayne said. "It  is the starting and stopping during concertina locomotion that is responsible  for a higher energetic cost," Jayne said.  </P> <P> Although snakes apparently conserve no energy by slinking along the ground on  their bellies, other reasons may have influenced the loss of their limbs during  the course of evolution.  </P> <P> "Without legs, snakes -- because of their cylindrical shape -- can squeeze  through very small openings. With legs that might be impossible," Jayne said.  </P> <P> C. Richard Taylor, a comparative physiologist at Harvard University who  conducted the earlier snake studies, said the new research indicates that  "snakes don't optimize for low energy costs, but instead for the flexibility  required to move across different terrains."  </P> <P> Robert Full, a locomotion expert at UC Berkeley, has found in his studies of  millipedes, cockroaches, salamanders and a variety of other animals that an  animal's size, not its number of legs, or lack of legs, determines the amount  of energy spent during locomotion.  </P></p>

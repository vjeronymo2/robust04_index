			<p><P> April 19, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 20 PROTEST PROPOSAL FOR NEW TERMINAL AT BURBANK AIRPORT  </P> <P> Noise protesters sharply attacked a proposal for a new terminal at Burbank  Airport, calling it part of a plan to expand commercial air traffic.  </P> <P> About 20 protesters turned out Monday for a rare night meeting of the  Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport Authority.  </P> <P> Residents east of the airport are "very upset" about recent increases in the  number of flights and the prospect of still more, said Kurt Hunter, president  of the North Hollywood Residents Assn.  </P> <P> Proposed sites for the new terminal include the airport's northeast corner and  a split-terminal plan under which automobile parking and ticket-selling  operations would be in a building in the southwest corner. Passengers would  travel underground to board waiting airliners from a structure in the northwest  sector.  </P> <P> The Federal Aviation Administration has been pressuring airport administrators  for years to construct a new terminal because the present structure, built more  than 50 years ago, is closer to runways than modern safety regulations allow.  </P> <P> The terminal is expected to cost $200 million to $250 million. Authority  members two weeks ago unanimously awarded an 18-month, $790,000 contract to  KPMG Peat Marwick Airport Consulting Services to prepare an environmental  impact report on the sites.  </P> <P> The northeast site, which most authority members appear to prefer, was studied  in 1984 but dropped at the insistence of the Pentagon in 1985 because it was  too close to Lockheed Corp.'s super-secret "skunk works," where advanced  military planes are designed.  </P> <P> The site, staunchly opposed by anti-noise protesters, was revived as a  possibility last year after Lockheed's announcement that the land was for sale  and the company's operations are moving.  </P> <P> Homeowners organized to fight airport noise are banking on the split-terminal  plan as a first step toward routing some flights to the east on takeoff,  instead of over Los Angeles neighborhoods to the south and west, including  Studio City and North Hollywood. The airport is owned by communities to the  east.  </P> <P> Under this plan, studied in 1987, a people-mover would carry passengers under  the east-west runway between the parking and ticket-selling area and the  airport's northwest sector, where planes would park.  </P> <P> Advocates of the "share the noise" plan note that, if airliners are parked on  the east side of the airport -- as would be required if the new terminal is  built on the Lockheed property -- pilots would be forced to taxi across the  north-south runway to take off to the east. They fear that pilots would refuse  to cross the runway for safety reasons, effectively preventing eastbound  takeoffs.  </P> <P> Eastbound takeoffs have been banned by the FAA for the past three years because  the east-west runway is closer to the terminal than the north-south runway.  </P> <P> Airport officials say that, in addition to the two previously studied sites,  Peat Marwick consultants are expected to study other configurations.  </P> <P> One possibility is placing parking and ticket-selling facilities in the  northeast part of the airport and a passenger boarding area in the northwest  sector.  </P> <P> Tom Paterson, president of Valley Village Homeowners Assn. in North Hollywood,  has written to the Los Angeles and Burbank city councils, asking them to sue to  prevent construction of a new terminal.  </P> <P> Paterson, whose letter was sent on behalf of 11 homeowner and anti-noise  organizations, also asked that the suit try to halt the flights that Southwest  Airlines began from the airport Monday.  </P> <P> "The strategy," he wrote, "is to pack the airport with more flights and  passengers to cost-justify . . . a $250-million replacement terminal project."  </P> <P> The airport's passenger total has dropped sharply in recent years, plummeting  from a peak of 3.2 million in 1987 to 2.7 million last year.  </P> <P> Southwest spokesmen say they hope to bring 350,000 additional passengers each  year to the Burbank facility.  </P></p>

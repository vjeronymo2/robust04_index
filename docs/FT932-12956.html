			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / Personal View: Germany in need of new policy mix Western Germany is in recession. Real gross domestic product is now expected to fall in 1993 by between 1.5 and 2 percentage points; unemployment will rise; and a turning point may be reached only in the first half of 1994, provided expectations of a sustained economic recovery in the US and a rapid expansion of world trade materialise. The western German economy, to be sure, will not play the role of a locomotive for the rest of European Community in the near future. The hope is that the recession does not become stronger than is now foreseen, otherwise eastern Germany would be adversely affected. To many, it appears that a quick recovery is impeded by the Bundesbank's high interest rates which have strangled the other EC economies and thus have hampered German exports. But the Bundesbank is not the problem; the real difficulties lie elsewhere. The biggest problem is fiscal policy. The fiscal deficit has been rising significantly since unification. In 1992, it amounted to 4 per cent of GDP; if off-budget liabilities are included, the deficit was 7 per cent. Public financial transfers to eastern Germany (about DM150bn (Pounds 60.9bn) in 1992, equal to 5.5 per cent of west German GDP) will remain high for years to come. Such financial imbalances are not sustainable over the medium term. Hence, strict budget consolidation, with a cumulative four-year cut to bring the structural deficit down to 2 per cent of GDP, is necessary. Whether or not the 'solidarity pact' which political leaders agreed in mid-March puts fiscal policy back on a sound financial path remains to be seen. On the positive side, it is important that decisions on financial transfers to the east and the burden-sharing in the west have finally been taken. However, the chosen approach gives cause for concern. Priority is being given to sharp tax increases rather than substantial spending cuts. Direct taxes, rather than the more investment-neutral indirect taxes, will be raised (with effect in 1995). The projected saving measures exclude social payments, whereas curbs on financial aids (which account for two-thirds of total subsidies) will remain relatively small. Moreover, public indebtedness is going to increase further, as the borrowing limits of the Treuhand and the German Bank for Reconstruction will be raised. All this falls short of a sensible medium-term consolidation programme. The government expects the deficit to come down substantially, but this is based on quite optimistic assumptions on nominal GDP expansion in the next four years and on the ability of the public sector to limit the growth of expenditures. With regard to wage policy, things look relatively positive in western Germany. Recent wage settlements have been moderate and in view of high unemployment rates wage moderation is likely to persist for a while. In eastern Germany, however, there is cause for concern. Trade unions insist on a rapid convergence of wages with western levels in spite of the great productivity gap still prevailing. A damaging strike in the metal and electrical sectors is possible next month. Fresh investment may therefore be deterred. Monetary policy has been gradually eased since last autumn, with the latest cuts in Bundesbank interest rates made last Thursday. A further sharp reduction in key rates is not recommended. Inflation is still high and after the excessive rise last year, annual growth in the money supply (M3) has not come down convincingly to the target range announced for 1993 (4.5 to 6.5 per cent). If the Bundesbank were to give way to pressures at home and abroad and embark on an outright expansionary policy, it would put the credibility of its anti-inflationary policy at risk. It should also be recalled that expansionary monetary policies have not proved to be particularly successful in the past in overcoming recessions, above all when deep structural adjustments are necessary. A continued cautious easing of monetary policy would lead to a full normalisation of the yield curve later this year. Germany needs a two-track strategy: consolidation on the budget side and a medium-term supply-side policy to enable potential output to grow at a reasonable rate. This includes trade liberalisation, deregulation and privatisation, as well as reform of the tax system, to make it more conducive to private investment in the context of high international capital mobility. Germany also needs to overhaul its social welfare system, to reduce costs and strengthen economic incentives. There is little, if any, co-ordination between these policies and short-term macroeconomic policies. Some measures are under way, but the government's preferred piecemeal actions are resisted by well-organised interest groups. The recent decision to protect, via subsidisation, so-called 'core industries' in eastern Germany is counter-productive and will be ineffectual. The planned tax reductions, both on corporate profits and on earnings from doing business, will be combined with a narrowing of depreciation allowances. Such tax reform, if enacted, would therefore have only a minor impact on investment. Moreover, income tax increases agreed as part of the solidarity pact will transform Germany into a truly high-taxation country. On trade policy, Germany still has to persuade her EC partners and the European Commission that the successful completion of the Uruguay Round is critical, especially in the short run, to restore business confidence about future economic developments.

			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: WPP By the standards of really big banking disasters, WPP is perhaps small beer. But its financial reconstruction, formally announced yesterday, bears the authentic scars of the 1980s. The deal is that the banks should write off Dollars 250m of debt in exchange for 55 per cent of a company with a net worth - even after the reconstruction - of rather less than zero. The stake owned by ordinary shareholders will fall from two thirds to 14 per cent. Holders of the convertible stock will see their equity entitlement fall from 34 per cent to 29 per cent. Since they presently control 80 per cent of the votes as a result of WPP's failure to pay preference dividends, they may well grumble about that. But as the banks will doubtless point out to them, in a worthless entity like WPP the concept of democracy scarcely applies. The most curious aspect of the deal is perhaps its timing. In the month since the UK election, shares in Saatchi &amp; Saatchi - which went through the same process of reconstruction just over a year ago - have risen by 66 per cent. Other media stocks such as Reed and Pearson have also risen, if less sharply. The recovery in advertising revenues on either side of the Atlantic is patchy and uncertain. But it almost seems as if WPP's banks, while writing off their mistakes in the lending game, have taken to playing the equity market instead.</p>

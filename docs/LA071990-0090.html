			<p><P> July 19, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PART OF MOUNTAIN GIVEN TO CONSERVANCY  </P> <P> Alarge section of the landmark Ladyface Mountain above Agoura Hills, named for  the shape of its delicate ridgeline, has been donated to the Santa Monica  Mountains Conservancy, officials announced Wednesday.  </P> <P> The conservancy, a state agency that acquires and preserves land for public use  in the Santa Monica Mountains, will open hiking trails in the 122-acre site  donated by Piedmont Development.  </P> <P> "We are happy to be able to preserve it," said John A. Diaz, a conservancy  commissioner.  </P> <P> Behrouz Soroudi, a general partner with Piedmont Development, which built a  hotel and two office buildings at the base of Ladyface Mountain, said his  company turned over the mountainside land because "it should be preserved for  people to enjoy."  </P> <P> David Anderson, Agoura Hills director of planning, said the land dedication was  part of an offer Piedmont made to the city when it sought approval in 1984 for  the hotel and office complex.  </P> <P> The site, valued at $1 million, includes the bulk of the mountainside and  ridgeline. Anderson said strict Agoura Hills zoning regulations on hillsides  would have severely limited Piedmont from building on the land that was  donated.  </P> <P> The conservancy has worked since the early 1980s to acquire Ladyface Mountain  because of its unusual contours and prime hiking location.  </P> <P> Conservancy officials said the Piedmont gift is a major step forward. Ten other  owners, however, hold land on the mountain, but the conservancy also hopes to  acquire that land.  </P> <P> "We have a foothold and we're going to try to continue," Diaz said.  </P> <P> Efforts by Piedmont to turn the land over to the conservancy started in 1988,  but the transaction was delayed for two years because of reluctant development  company investors, Soroudi said.  </P> <P> Plans are already under way to open the land to the public.  </P> <P> "We hope to open a trail up to the first plateau where people can hike up and  watch the sun set," Diaz said.  </P> <P> Before the dedication, all trails were privately owned and were difficult to  navigate. Conservancy officials expect to build a 2 1/2-mile trail system that  will be easier for inexperienced hikers to use.  </P> <P> Agoura Hills officials praised the conservancy and the development company for  contributing to the city's preservation efforts.  </P> <P> "Anytime we can get open space in the city it's appreciated," said Agoura Hills  Councilman Ed Kurtz.  </P> <P> A city ordinance limits developments to 1,100 feet to preserve the view of the  mountain. A plan to protect Ladyface and other scenic open space will come  before the City Council later this month, Kurtz said.  </P></p>

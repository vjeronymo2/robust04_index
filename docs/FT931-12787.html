			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / Westminster council to reduce pensions of 600 ex-employees WESTMINSTER City Council is set to cut the pensions of 600 former employees, giving them less than a month's notice, on the grounds that existing payments are too generous under the law. The pensioners will be deprived of an average of Pounds 750 a year, about 15 per cent of their pension. The only relief on offer is a welfare counselling service. One in six of Westminster's pensioners will be affected by the cuts, ranging from former cleaning staff to senior council officers. They are virtually all people made redundant at the age of 50 or above within the past five years, mostly as a result of restructuring or competitive tendering of services. The cuts are expected to save the council's superannuation fund Pounds 450,000 a year. On the basis of advice from leading QCs, Westminster believes that pensions paid under the redundancy package it operated until last year are probably too generous, because they exceed those prescribed by the 1972 Superannuation Act and subsequent regulations. Westminster has already acted to curb the size of future lump sum and pension payments. The decision to cut the pensions of those who left the council before those changes will almost certainly be taken this Friday, at a three-member sub-committee of Westminster's policy and resources committee. Letters will then be sent to those affected. No attempt will be made to claw back sums already paid. Mr Bill Roots, Westminster's finance director, said yesterday: 'This is an awful business, but we have no choice in the matter. I have a clear duty to follow legal advice that the current level of payments is unlawful.' Westminster took advice after a Court of Appeal ruling in March 1992 that North Tyneside council's voluntary severance scheme was unlawful because it was more generous than that provided by government regulations. The level of continuing pensions paid to those over 50 was not a direct issue, but may have been affected. The Audit Commission, the local government watchdog, has advised councils to re-examine severance schemes. Swansea City Council last November reduced the pensions of 110 former staff by an average of 10 per cent.</p>

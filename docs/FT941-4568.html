			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / International Company News: Liberty Life profits surge on record new life business Liberty Life, South Africa's largest listed life insurer, has turned in a 24 per cent rise in earnings to 164 cents a share from 132 cents as its growing domestic and UK insurance and property interests emerged unscathed from recession in both countries in 1993. Mr Donald Gordon, chairman, said the year was 'undoubtedly' the most successful the group had experienced in its 36-year history. The advance was based largely on record new life business written by Liberty Life in South Africa and Sun Life Assurance, the group's UK subsidiary company jointly owned with Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP), France's state-run insurance group which is on the verge of privatisation. Mr Gordon said the increase in new annualised recurring premiums at Liberty Life to R750m (Dollars 215m) from R577m was the best indication of the group's progress. Overall new business climbed by 50 per cent to R2.58bn from R1.7bn the previous year. Net premium income surged by nearly 45 per cent to R10.6bn from R7.36bn in the year to end-December. A smaller increase in investment income, up at R3.9bn from R3.62bn, left total income at R14.5bn compared with R11bn, of which more than half derived from the group's UK businesses. Net income rose by a quarter to R441.8m from R352.8m on which a dividend with a scrip alternative but equivalent to 164 cents, against 132 cents in 1992, was declared last month. The consolidation of Sun Life's contribution to group results, triggered by new accounting standards in South Africa, transformed Liberty's balance sheet which showed total assets rising to R86.6bn from R61.6bn. Mr Gordon said the group's diversification into the UK shopping centre trade was paying off with plans well advanced for the listing of Capital Shopping Centres (CSC) in April. The group plans to raise Pounds 200m from the flotation of CSC whose major asset is Lakeside Shopping Centre near Thurrock, east of London. Mr Gordon added that Liberty would like to acquire a share of the US insurance market before his retirement as chairman in five years.</p>

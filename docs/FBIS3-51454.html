			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Roberto Morejon commentary from the "Evening Information </F> Review" newscast]    [Text] At this time of necessary changes, Cuban labor  unions are pushing to become the vanguard in adapting the Cuban  system to the very unfavorable international context, and they  are doing this by promoting internal reorganization of the  nation's finances. The union movement advocates doing away with  formalism, and it supports a more realistic look at problems and  their possible solutions from the perspective of the workplace,  as well as from a nationwide point of view. A recent editorial  in the weekly TRABAJADORES, mouthpiece of the labor unions,  called for the elimination of ritual and repetitive language.  It asked for an end to the constant use of triumphant arrogance  during everyday work at the unions' grass-roots level -- a level  that includes factories, workshops, and service centers.    TRABAJADORES attacked the use of what Cubans call "teques."  This means using propaganda slogans instead of objectively  analyzing the problems affecting any given daily situation.  "Teques," according to the weekly, is the corruption of  revolutionary language. It called on the unions to move into an  offensive mode and leave behind the habit of forever waiting for  guidance from higher up while deficiencies continue to grow at  the workplace. The call for a more specific analysis of the  problems affecting a certain work center and the country in  general is consistent with the nationwide effort to face the  economic crisis provoked by external forces in a way as  realistic as possible.    The same weekly had previously called on workers to fight  for  social equality and to banish egalitarianism practices of years  gone by. These methods had such a negative effect that they  managed to neutralize the workers' enthusiasm to produce more  and better products. The current trend is to consider equality  as a beautiful humanistic ideal and also as a condition for  economic development.    Now, more than ever before, Cubans believe it is time to do  away with idealistic practices and to cautiously apply the  socialist principle of distribution of wealth according to the  quality and quantity of work performed by each individual. In  this context, it should be understood that if work does not  become the true gauge with which to measure merit and, in turn,  measure each worker's standard of living, current deterrents to  production and efficiency will prevail.    The Cuban unions will support the socialist formulas  designed  to increase work results and will have greater participation in  the decisionmaking process in this area. Whenever this does not  occur, it will be the workers themselves who will demand the  unions assume their rightful role.</p>

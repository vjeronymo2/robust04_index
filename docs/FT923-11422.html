			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / Isosceles confirms details of its refinancing deal ISOSCELES, owner of the struggling Gateway supermarket chain, yesterday confirmed details of a refinancing deal that will allow it to step up its development programme with a view to floating the business in 1995. As part of the agreement the company is proposing to reorganise its capital structure, substantially diluting its ordinary equity. Isosceles implicitly accepted the failure of the Gateway brand as it said it intended to convert most of its 650 stores into new fascias, including its Food Giant discount superstores and the Somerfield fresh food chain. In the next three years, Isosceles intends to open 150 Somerfield stores, by converting Gateway stores and opening new sites. It is also experimenting with other fascias such as a So-Lo discount chain, David Greig and the Gateway Village convenience store chain. The company still intends to sell Herman's, its US sporting goods subsidiary, and Wellworths, its grocery chain based in Northern Ireland. It seems more likely that Wellworths will be sold to a trade buyer rather than floated on the stock market. The company's capital expenditure budget will remain at about Pounds 100m in the current year although it has also won the right to spend a further Pounds 30m of any money it raises from disposals. Isosceles's preference shares will be converted into ordinary shares as part of a 'tidying-up exercise' but holders of the mezzanine debt will also be issued with warrants exercisable at 1p per share to subscribe for 20 per cent of the fully diluted ordinary share capital. Interest payments on Pounds 300m of mezzanine debt will continue to be rolled up until February, 1993 under more flexible arrangements. The deal has been agreed by the 50 banks which hold the company's Pounds 1.1bn of senior debt and its mezzanine debt holders. The main holders of the ordinary equity have also accepted the amendments, although they still have to be approved by shareholders in a formal meeting. Isosceles's results for the year to April 25 will be released shortly after that meeting. Mr Bob Nellist, finance director, said: 'We have gone over a bump in the road and are confident that the legal arrangements will now be put in place.'</p>

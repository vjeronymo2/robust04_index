			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / Inflation rate increase smaller than expected: Mortgage rates aid RPI fall The annual rate of inflation rose in January but the increases in both the headline rate and the underlying rate were lower than expected, thanks partly to heavy discounting in the January sales. Figures published by the Central Statistical Office show the retail prices index was 141.3 in January, down from 141.9 in December, a 0.4 per cent month-on-month decline. The annual rate of inflation jumped to 2.5 per cent from December's 1.9 per cent, however, as a sharp fall in the RPI in January 1993 dropped out of the comparison. Mortgage rates fell 0.3 per cent in January, contributing just more than 0.1 per cent to the index's decline. In January last year, however, a 0.9 per cent decline in mortgage rates had knocked 0.5 per cent off the index. If mortgage rates are excluded, the underlying annual rate of inflation in January was 2.8 per cent, up from 2.7 per cent in December. The market consensus had been a forecast of an underlying rate of 3 per cent and a headline rate of 2.6 per cent. The headline and underlying rates of inflation are now closer together than at any time since October 1992, as the effects of the cuts in mortgage rates after Black Wednesday disappear. Both figures are in the middle of the government's 1 per cent to 4 per cent target range. Mr Michael Hughes, managing director of BZW Global Economics and Strategy, said: 'Underlying inflation is still pretty subdued.' Mr Simon Briscoe, UK economist at SG Warburg Securities, said it was an encouraging sign that service-sector inflation, which had been stubbornly high, was now falling. Producer price figures, published earlier this week, showed that manufacturers' costs were still falling. The January sales led to some sharp price falls in individual sectors. Clothing and footwear prices fell 5.1 per cent between December and January, equal to the largest monthly fall since 1921. Prices of household goods, such as furniture and electrical appliances, fell 2.8 per cent during the month, the largest monthly fall since comparable records began in 1956.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- UK inflation rate: +2.5%                         RPI: 141.3 in January  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Food (seasonal) (21)                  -1.7% Food (non-seasonal) (123)             +1.4% Catering (45)                         +4.9% Alcoholic drink (78)                  +3.9% Tobacco (35)                         +11.0% Housing (164)                         -0.9% Fuel &amp; light (46)                     -1.3% Household goods (79)                  +0.2% Household services (47)               +1.9% Clothing &amp; footwear (58)              +1.1% Personal goods, serv.

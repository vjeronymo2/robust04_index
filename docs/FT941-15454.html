			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / International Bonds: Canada's Dollars 2bn FRN issue meets solid investor demand Canada returned to the Eurobond market for the first time since 1987, tapping investor demand for US dollar floating-rate notes from a rare, top-rated issuer. It launched a Dollars 2bn five-year issue of FRNs via CS First Boston, Goldman Sachs and UBS paying interest at three-month Libor minus 25 basis points, which ended the day bid at their 99.77 reoffer price. According to one of the lead managers, the deal met with solid demand in Europe and the Far East. Although the pricing was slightly tighter than expected, the deal was oversubscribed and sold out in the course of the day, a syndicate official said. 'Canada has a certain cachet; the issue offers investors scope for diversification; and it provides a new, liquid benchmark,' said Mr Len Harwood, head of syndication at UBS. Besides the usual range of institutional investors, central banks, which only hold sovereign bonds, and commercial banks, for which sovereign debt has a zero risk weighting under BIS rules, were reported to have been keen bidders. According to an official at Canada's finance department, the issue was undertaken to diversify the sources of US dollar funding of Canada's foreign exchange reserves. The proceeds of the issue will be used to pay down a portion of a Dollars 5bn commercial paper facility in the US, called Canada Bills, he said. The issue will not increase Canada's overall indebtedness, he said. Goldman Sachs cashed in on investors' appetite for dollar FRNs by launching a Dollars 200m issue of five-year notes for itself. Paying a coupon of three-month Libor plus 37 1/2 basis points, it also sold out quickly and ended the day trading at 99.97 bid, above its 99.90 reoffer price, a syndicate official said. Market participants expect to see more dollar FRNs in coming weeks. 'We are seeing more and more people putting funds into the money market - this generated a lot of tickets for the Canada deal,' said one dealer. Many investors also seek exposure to the US currency, which they expect to appreciate as US interest rates edge higher. Among fixed-rate dollar deals, the Swedish holding company Investor, which owns Saab-Scania and holds stakes in several Swedish blue-chip companies, issued Dollars 200m of five-year bonds priced to yield 113 basis points above the relevant benchmark. The lead manager was CS First Boston. Despite a rating of Baa2 from Moody's and single-A from Standard &amp; Poor's, the paper met with strong demand from yield-hungry investors and ended at 99.60 bid, above its 99.46 reoffer price, while the spread narrowed to 110 basis points. Elsewhere, Abbey National Treasury Services' Pounds 500m foray into the Eurosterling sector was dogged by a sell-off in the gilt market shortly after launch. The five-year bonds, via JP Morgan and Samuel Montagu, were priced to yield 30 basis points over the relevant gilt. The deal closed at 98.95 bid, below the 99.19 reoffer price, although the spread remained stable around 30 basis points. While the lead managers reported demand from the European continent, other traders said the deal would take some time to place given the sheer weight of recent supply in the sterling sector. However, as one observer pointed out, the issue enables investors to switch out of the 6 per cent gilt of August 1999 into a liquid Eurobond with the same maturity at a 30-basis-point yield pick-up. Another Pounds 100m of perpetual, subordinated bonds for Barings, issued at a spread of 255 basis points over the 8 3/4 per cent Treasury due 2017, ended at 99 5/8 bid, slightly above its 99.598 reoffer price. Two Eurolira issues, totalling L550bn, were also dogged by market congestion after some L1,500bn of fresh supply this week. However, IMI Bank's L300bn five-year bonds via IMI Luxembourg benefited from some European investors' quest for high yields, offering a yield pick-up of 37 basis points over the five-year swap rate. The IADB's L250bn 10-year bonds via JP Morgan also met with some European interest, but both issues are likely to take some time to be placed, officials said. Moody's has downgraded the Republic of Turkey's debt to speculative grade from investment grade. It lowered the country's long-term credit rating to Ba1, from Baa3, citing the deterioration of Turkey's public finances and the expectation that high fiscal deficits will persist in coming years.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 5 KYODO -- Japan's top four business  leaders on Wednesday [5 January] warned against an early Diet  dissolution as it could damage administration of economic  affairs, including the compilation of a fiscal 1994 government  budget. In a joint new year press conference, the business  leaders stressed the need to pump-prime the economy by an income  tax cut, and pass political reforms bill by the end of the  current Diet session January 29. They said the tax cut could be  financed by "bridge" deficit-financing bonds.    Masaru Hayami, chairman of the Japan Association of  Corporate  Executives, said if the House of Representatives was dissolved  this month it would have a large negative impact on the economy.    Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Federation of Economic  Organizations (Keidanren), called for steady implementation of  reforms in all areas -- political, economic, and administrative.    Such support for Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's  government reflects fears that political turmoil could further  damage the economy, which is still in recession, political  analysts say. But it would also be a blow to the opposition  Liberal Democratic Party, they say, and the divide between  businesses and the former ruling party could widen.    As to the pending issue of a consumption tax hike to finance  a cut in personal income taxes, Hiraiwa merely said it is a  "future issue," while Takeshi Nagano, president of the Japan  Federation of Employers' Associations, said it should be  considered "after business conditions recover."    Both Hayami and Kosaku Inaba, chairman of the Japan Chamber  of Commerce and Industry, expressed similar views.    Referring to the recent recovery of the dollar against the  yen above the 113 yen line, Hiraiwa said the currency is still  too low and Japanese companies will be happy if it rises to  around 120 yen.    Hayami, however, said he would like to see the dollar  stabilize somewhere at the 110 yen level.    Nagano said that this year industry should place a priority  on ensuring employments rather than wage raises, which he said  are quite difficult for the corporate management to offer.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To ensure proper development and execution of the plan,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the commenters recommend that we require the State to submit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its transfer plan to HCFA for approval. HCFA, in turn,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should assess performance under the transfer plan annually,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during the review of the State's enforcement performance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The commenters end their rewrite of proposed &sect;488.240 with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an enforcement recommendation that if the State's transfer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plan is found inadequate, HCFA should take actions as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> described in proposed &sect;488.243 (b) and (c). They also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommend that immediate implementation of the plan be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waived during a crisis or disaster which makes it impossible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to fully implement a State's transfer plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to the detailed rewrite of the section, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters recommend that the term ``all residents'' be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> defined, because the amount of assistance residents receive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the transfer process is directly related to their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicaid, Medicare, or private payment status. For example,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicaid residents receive services such as notice of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> closing, information about care options, counseling,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transportation, and other types of relocation assistance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicare residents are often not offered any of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> services, and private pay residents usually receive no help  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whatsoever. One commenter suggested that it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inappropriate to ``require'' the transfer of residents if the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility has not been delicensed by the State and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> residents choose to remain at the facility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further, one of the commenters states that the preamble  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the text of the proposed regulation differ as to which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency has the responsibility for transferring residents,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the preamble stating that the State agency must arrange  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for transfer, proposed &sect;488.240 stating that the State has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the responsibility, and &sect;441.11(a)(2) stating that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicaid agency does.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We believe the commenters inadvertently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transposed proposed section numbers &sect;488.234 (b) and (c) as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> there are no proposed sections &sect;488.243 (b) and (c). We  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appreciate these very thorough and specific comments and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amount of effort that went into them. Although there are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> valid considerations in the suggested rewrite of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section, some of them may be impossible for the States to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implement. We, therefore, choose not to impose such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stringent requirements on the States. Existing regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at &sect;483.12(a) provide numerous procedural safeguards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regarding the transfer and discharge of residents. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition, the States are already required by sections  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1819(h)(4) and 1919(h)(5) of the Act to provide for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> orderly transfer of residents when a facility is terminated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or closed, and at sections 1819(c)(2) and 1919(c)(2) of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act, to provide notice of transfer at least 30 days in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> advance in most cases. We agree that proposed &sect;488.240,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> now incorporated into &sect;488.426, which uses the words ``all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> residents,'' may be overly broad and we are revising that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section to specify that only Medicare and Medicaid residents  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are affected by this section. We accept the suggestion that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the term ``orderly transfer'' be amended to ``safe and orderly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transfer'' to maintain consistency with the language of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sections 1819(h)(4) and 1919(h)(5) of the Act. Since  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sections 1819(h)(4) and 1919(h)(5) address immediate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> jeopardy terminations, we cannot accept the comment that it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is appropriate to allow any Medicare or Medicaid residents  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to remain in a facility that is being terminated for such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> serious situations. To do so, would put these residents in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> jeopardy and would be clearly contrary to sections  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1819(h)(4) and 1919(h)(5) of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The following addresses what one of the commenters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> perceives as conflicting information regarding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibility for the orderly transfer of residents. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preamble did indeed state that the survey agency is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsible for arranging for transfers, while proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;488.240 (now incorporated into &sect;488.426) is taken  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> directly from sections 1819(h) and 1919(h) of the Act and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> places the responsibility generally on the State. We wish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to give the States the greatest latitude in determining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which State agencies they will use. Therefore, it is our  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intent to rely on the broader interpretation in proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;488.240 and place the responsibility on the State as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required by the Act. Although the commenter has correctly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pointed out that &sect;441.11(a)(2) places the responsibility on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Medicaid agency, we believe that each State should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> given the flexibility to select the appropriate agency under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its particular governmental structure. Therefore, we are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revising &sect;441.11(a)(2) accordingly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  This commenter stated that, in the past, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibility for arranging for the orderly transfer of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> residents to another facility whenever a provider agreement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is terminated has been placed on the facility operator  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subject to the State's oversight. This commenter stated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the proposed regulations would impose substantial costs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and uncertain legal liabilities upon the State.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  According to existing regulations at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;483.12(a), the State, not the facility, has had the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibility in the past for numerous procedural  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safeguards regarding the transfer and discharge of residents  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and has funded such costs. Sometimes the facilities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cooperate in the transfer of residents and sometimes they do  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not. Sometimes they have no resources with which to help.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, the ultimate responsibility for all aspects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relative to transfer of residents in the case of a facility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> closure lies with the State to ensure that the well-being of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> residents is protected.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Another commenter agreed with the regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> text but wanted us to require, in the case of provider  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agreement termination, that the State permit a resident to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remain in a terminated facility provided the resident  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> arranges to pay for his or her care and the facility does  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not close.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  It is not necessary to require States to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allow residents to remain in terminated facilities because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> they already have that right. If a resident prefers to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remain in a terminated facility that is still operating, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is able to pay for his or her own care, that resident has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> every right to do so. The government has fulfilled its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obligation by providing notice to residents that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility's provider agreement has been terminated. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applies whether or not immediate jeopardy exists. The State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is the only entity that has the authority to close or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> delicense a facility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter suggested that if residents are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transferred because a facility is terminated, we should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require that the State provide for such transfer, at its own  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expense, and that it be held liable for its action during  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

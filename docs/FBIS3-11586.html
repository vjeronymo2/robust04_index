			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 22 Mar (NA) -- Foreign Ministry  Secretary General Andres Cisneros has implicitly accepted the  existence of a 30-April deadline imposed by the United States  for Argentina to approve a new law on pharmaceutical patents.    Cisneros explained that U.S. laws "do not contain deadlines,  but mechanisms for presenting proposals," admitting, however,  that 30 April is the date foreseen in this mechanism.    The official said dates "are not arbitrarily set by U.S.  executive officials." They are part of U.S. laws.    Cisneros explained that these laws "do not establish  deadlines, but provide mechanisms and certain dates for  submitting proposals."    The Foreign Ministry secretary said U.S. laws contemplate  economic sanctions against Argentina if a new law on  pharmaceutical patents is not approved within the established  period.    Cisneros said the Argentine Government "will respond to this  pressure, defending the country's interests." Cisneros added  that the new law will not "solely respond to foreign pressure,  but also to Argentina's national interests."    "U.S. Government and Argentine interests are not necessarily  incompatible. Compatibility ends when interests become  incongruous," Cisneros warned.    "This is not being difficult or different from what is being  done by other Western economies in similar situations," Cisneros  said, adding: "We are not doing anything different from what was  done within the GATT."    Regarding the possibilities of the bill's approval by  Congress, Cisneros said: "We do not see any problems." He  added: "Congress will approve the measure when legislators think  our national interests are served." Cisneros admitted that it  will be very difficult to get a new law approved by the last day  of next month.    "Economic sanctions are not good, but Argentina handles its  own schedule for approving laws and pursues its own interests."    Cisneros confessed that U.S. Vice President Albert Gore  received a sort of promise that the bill will finally be  approved because the Government "must draft and send the bill  and then get it approved."</p>

			<p>920729 FT  29 JUL 92 / Letter: Prices are no joke Sir, Ms Balsom (Letters, July 20) is absolutely right about rip-off prices for products in Britain. However, this only touches the surface. The cost of so-called professional services such as the law and accountancy is nothing less than a scandal. This problem derives from attitudes at the very heart of the City of London. My UK bank recently wrote to me explaining that charges would rise in 'order to contain rising costs'. Am I losing my facility in British English - or just my sense of humour?

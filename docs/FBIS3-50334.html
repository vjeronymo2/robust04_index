			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ivan Peto, chairman of the Alliance of Free </F> Democrats, by Szabolcs Szereto; place and date not given: "We  Should Not Limit the Coalition Possibilities"]    [Text] [Szereto] You said recently that the next  government would start its activity under more difficult  conditions than the Antall cabinet did in 1990. Prime Minister  Peter Boross also reacted to your statement in a television  interview. Would you give us some details about your statement?    [Peto] I would like to point out that I formulated my  statement as an assessment of the situation, and not as a value  judgment. I did not deal with the question of who was  responsible for the situation and to what extent. Statistical  data, analyses made by independent experts, and my experience  accumulated during my various visits all over the country prove  that Hungary's mood and economic situation are worse now. It is  a fact that national income has decreased considerably, the  agricultural sector has lost its former role of economic  stabilizer, unemployment has become a massive problem, and  insecurity has generally increased. I think that one of the  greatest mistakes of this government was that it did not  evaluate Hungary's situation when it came to power. It also  belongs to the general picture that many people were not aware  of the realities. In formulating its election program, the  Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] started from the real  situation prevailing in Hungary, because this is the only  realistic starting point. This is particularly important in the  case of a party that has a good chance of participating in the  next government.    [Szereto] What will the SZDSZ deputies' meeting that starts  tomorrow deal with?    [Peto] It will be the task of group meetings to finalize the  detailed program. While this will actually be a professional  workshop activity, at the plenary meeting where Gabor Kuncze and  I will give speeches we want to formulate our ideas to the  broadest public possible. We would like to present a  comprehensive picture about the SZDSZ to the broadest public  possible. Ever since we elected Gabor Kuncze as our nominee for  the position of prime minister, a special division of labor has  emerged between us. According to this, Gabor Kuncze speaks  mainly about parliamentary and government affairs, program  formulation, and economic issues to be placed in the center of  our election campaign. As the chairman of the party, I will  speak mainly about the general political situation, including  the situation of the SZDSZ.    [Szereto] Under your leadership, the SZDSZ emerged as a  uniform and organized party in the eyes of the public, and the  arrival of the former members of the Federation of Young  Democrats [FIDESZ] will obviously strengthen your position.  However, opinion polls show that the SZDSZ does not enjoy the  same level of support today as it enjoyed in 1990. In view of  this, what is your opinion about the election prospects of the  SZDSZ and generally of the liberal bloc?    [Peto] Indeed, the SZDSZ is not yet in the position it wants  to achieve during the elections, but this was the case months  before the 1990 elections too. Opinion polls are multifaceted  and we can have an idea about the election prospects of a party  not only on the basis of primary support, but also on the basis  of other factors. Some 40 percent of voters would welcome the  SZDSZ in the next coalition, which is a pretty good percentage.  Many people predict an SZDSZ victory, and we have strong  secondary support, and very few people say that they would not  vote for us in any case. Therefore, the SZDSZ has considerable  resources and, based on all this, I am sure that we will give  our supporters a pleasant surprise at the elections. We are  striving to make sure that the liberal forces show a  considerable presence in the new parliament, and this is why an  SZDSZ-FIDESZ agreement was achieved. In harmony with this  agreement, we are building relations with other liberal parties,  like the Agrarian Federation and the Party of Entrepreneurs.  With them, and with the Republic Party, we will nominate joint  candidates. In my opinion, the liberal forces have good  election chances and it seems that they will play a decisive  role in the next parliament. I am also sure that it will be  impossible to form a coalition without the liberal parties.    [Szereto] On the basis of various statements, one can  conclude that the positions of the two parliamentary liberal  parties differ somewhat regarding coalition intentions. Your  political rivals often accuse you of approaching the Hungarian  Socialist Party [MSZP]. What are your relations with the MSZP  like, and what kind of coalition ideas do you have?    [Peto] It is useless to deny that the SZDSZ and the FIDESZ  speak differently about coalition possibilities but, in my  opinion, these differences can be bridged. When the coalition  talks started, the SZDSZ started from the premise that we must  preserve all the possibilities of a future coalition. We did  not want, nor do we want now, to limit our available political  scope with artificial means, political gestures, or unilateral  declarations. We regard the statements of the Hungarian  Democratic Forum [MDF] and Christian Democratic People's Party  [KDNP] deputies as a fact, namely their slogan of "not with the  SZDSZ." Indeed, we did not have too many chances of cooperating  with these parties after the elections. The statements coming  from the government side, statements that present the FIDESZ as  a proper party as opposed to the SZDSZ, obviously aim at  disbanding the liberal alliance. Although the FIDESZ leaders  made a lot of unfriendly statements about the socialists, they  did not exclude the possibility of a coalition in principle, and  the MSZP did not clearly exclude any liberal party from a  possible coalition either. I would characterize the relations  between the SZDSZ and the MSZP as a correct coexistence: We do  not join the so-called anticommunist campaign, we maintain our  objective criticism of the MSZP policy, and we formulate our  concerns. While the MSZP focuses on its social sensitivity, in  my view, this party continues to be largely bound to the elite  that also profited from the previous regime. The appearance of  some socialist candidates and others also shows that many  representatives of the old regime who have been in the  background so far will become "reactivated" at the next  elections. This could produce internal tensions within the MSZP,  because those who played a role in this party so far and were  active politically in the course of the past four years despite  all the inconveniences involved will now be able to meet in  their own party with people against whom they represented the  concept of reform and democratic transformation. At the same  time, one can see a contradiction between the written economic  concepts of the MSZP and the declared goals presented at  meetings. All this makes it difficult to evaluate the  socialists' real political intentions. The possible coalition  talks after the elections will actually show the extent to which  the actual concepts and political practice of the MSZP are  compatible with the liberal ideals. I regard the attempt of  "connecting" the SZDSZ with the MSZP as part of the negative  campaign. As part of this campaign, rumors have been spread  lately of secret negotiations between the two parties on  cooperation in the second round of the elections. There is no  basis for all this, and it would also be useless, because it  could happen that the two parties become the most serious rivals  of each other in the second round.</p>

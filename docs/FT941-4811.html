			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / International Bonds: Turkey postpones Dollars 750m global offer Recent price weakness in government bond markets claimed another victim yesterday when the Republic of Turkey pulled its Dollars 750m global bond offering at the eleventh hour. Two weeks ago, a heavy fall in US Treasuries led the National Bank of Hungary to delay its global offering. Joint lead manager Salomon Brothers blamed poor market conditions for Turkey's postponement. It said US Treasury yields had risen five basis points since price talks with the borrower earlier in the day. Turkey had considered inserting a three-year put option into the 10-year offer to make it more palatable. Although price talk was around 250 basis points over the yield on 10-year Treasuries, the put meant Turkey would have to pay 350 basis points over three-year Treasuries. This was thought too high. Although Turkey decided to wait for better conditions, syndicate managers reported a wide range of borrowers making enquiries about raising funds in the Eurobond market. The Inter-American Development Bank confirmed that it was considering a Eurobond offering in sterling, the proceeds of which would be swapped into Swiss francs. The 10-year bond was likely to raise around Pounds 125m and could be launched this week provided agreement could be reached on terms. The bank said S. G. Warburg was involved in the discussions. Price talk was 10 to 15 basis points over the yield on 10-year UK gilts. The main deal was a Pounds 250m offering of five-year Eurobonds from Chubu Electric Power of Japan. The pricing of the bonds, to yield 40 basis points over five-year gilts, was described as generous in the light of the borrower's superior credit rating. Joint lead manager S. G. Warburg said realistic pricing was needed to re-open the market after the recent fall in bond prices. Nevertheless, syndicate managers said the pricing was not enough to ensure swift placement and estimated that only half of the bonds had been sold by the close of business.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 24 (YONHAP) -- Seoul will have to  reconsider the inter-Korean denuclearization declaration if  Pyongyang continues to maintain a controversial radiochemical  laboratory which is in fact a nuclear reprocessing plant, Deputy  Prime Minister Yi Hong-ku says.    Speaking before the National Assembly Foreign Affairs and  Unification Committee Monday, Yi said that "the joint  denuclearization declaration has virtually been nullified in a  sense and it will be a delicate problem how to handle the issue."    He said his government would spend much time and energy  examining how to handle the validity of the declaration in light  of "nuclear independence."    "We are now at the point where we have to study seriously  how  to handle the issue of validity of the declaration in case it  was nullified, rather than just (get obsessed with) a vacuum  (left by the nullification)," he said. "We will face a situation  in which we will be compelled to discuss this problem for at  least several months, or perhaps until next year, from a new  angle," said Yi, who is also minister of the National  Unification Board.    On the surface, the deputy premier's remarks can be viewed  as  a clear indication that the Seoul government intends to review  the inter-Korean declaration on the denuclearization of the  peninsula signed on Dec. 31, 1991.    Earlier, Yi said that if it was internationally confirmed  that North Korea possesses "not just one but even one-half of a  nuclear weapon," the denuclearization declaration would be  regarded as nullified.    After he made that remark, Yi told reporters it was meant  as"a message not only to North Korea but to the United States as  well. "    Speaking to the Foreign Affairs and Unification Committee,  Yi  further clarified his purpose in making the remark. He said he  had directed his statement at those in the United States,  including Defense Secretary William Perry, who have said the  international community would probably have to overlook North  Korea's possession of one or two nuclear bombs.    Senior South Korean Government officials said the deputy  prime minister's statement should be viewed as an unequivocal  message to the United States that "Seoul would never accept a  policy that allows North Korean possession of a nuclear weapon."    Yi's statement should be taken as an expression of the Seoul  government's firm position that North Korea must be stopped from  acquiring nuclear weapons at any cost, rather than merely as an  expression of Seoul's intention to reconsider the declaration.    As evidence, Yi has always spoke by adding such conditional  clauses as "if North Korea possessed nuclear weapons," or "if  Pyongyang continues to maintain the nuclear reprocessing plant,"  and so on. In other words, if North Korea gave up its nuclear  weapons program, there would be no need for reconsideration of  the inter- Korean denuclearization declaration.</p>

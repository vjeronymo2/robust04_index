			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Irfan Sapmaz and Selin Caglayan: "Aliyev: I Will </F> Not Turn My Back on Moscow"]    [Text] The balanced policy President Geydar Aliyev is  trying to maintain toward Ankara and Moscow came to light at the  end of his contacts in Ankara yesterday. Aliyev asked Turkey to  increase its arms supplies to Azerbaijan and assured the Turkish  officials that Russia's military forces can only be deployed in  his country within the CSCE framework and together with the  military units of other countries. Aliyev said, however, that he  will not completely turn his back on Moscow.    Replying to the questions Turkish journalists asked him,  Aliyev asserted: "I shall neither open nor close Azerbaijan's  door to Moscow. Azerbaijan will remain an independent country."    Stressing that Russia is in the region and that it has  50,000  troops in Armenia and Georgia, Aliyev said: "Moscow wishes to  increase the number of its troops. Russian military units guard  the Armenian and Georgian borders with Turkey. Considering that  state of affairs, Russia can be described as having intervened  in the region."    Aliyev, who buys arms from the generals in Moscow who are  known as arms dealers, has asked Turkey to supply more arms to  Azerbaijan so that Baku can reduce its dependence on Russia.  Meanwhile, Nedzhmettin Sadykhov, Azerbaijan's former chief of  staff who has accompanied Aliyev to Turkey as his military  adviser, is holding talks with military officials in Ankara.    Aliyev has asked President Demirel and Prime Minister Ciller  to agree to send more officers to Azerbaijan to train the  military units of that republic. Demirel and Ciller have  promised every kind of aid to Azerbaijan.</p>

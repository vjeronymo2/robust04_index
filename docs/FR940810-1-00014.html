Current &sect;&sect;171.080(e)(1) and (e)(2) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Seven comments stated that the standard of a 15 degree range of stability in paragraph (e)(1) is unreasonable for wide-beam vessels and should be deleted if the area standard is met. One comment suggested that the range be limited to the angle developed from application of wind heel in &sect;170.070. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Seven comments found paragraph (e)(2) completely unreasonable in its treatment of watertight closures. Four comments stated that weathertight closures should not be considered points of flooding in damage stability. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=2 --> 2. Current &sect;171.080(e)(3) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Four comments found paragraph (e)(3) to be reasonable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=2 --> 3. Current &sect;171.080(e)(4)(i) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> One comment stated that there should be no standard for passenger heeling moment, because its author's vessels operate close to shore and have crews trained in passenger control to avoid extreme heeling moments. Four comments stated that the standard of a 0.10 meter righting arm for passenger heeling moment seemed reasonable. Five comments stated that the standard for passenger heeling moment should be limited to that for intact stability in &sect;171.050. One comment stated that standards for passenger heeling moments are necessary even for inland waters. One comment stated that the standard for residual passenger heeling moment exceeds those for intact wind heeling moment and intact passenger heeling moment. One comment cited a 150-passenger aluminum ``T-boat'' (small passenger vessel) built in 1988 as a sample of a typical vessel that cannot comply with the standard for passenger heeling moment. One comment stated that, of the vessels examined that met the old damage stability standard easily, four had flooded decks trying to meet the current one for passenger heeling moment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=2 --> 4. Current &sect;171.080(e)(4)(iii) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> One comment suggested that we delete the standard for lifeboat heeling moment since no ``T-boat'' has davit-launched lifeboats. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> Response to Comments on Final Rule Citing Particular Provisions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> It is unacceptable for standards (whether governing design or operation) to assume that all vessels will stay close to shore or that the crew will, in all situations, be able to control passengers so as to avoid extreme heeling moments. However, a tiered approach, based on route, will give these factors some weight. Again, equivalency between standards for intact stability and those for damage stability is not the goal. Those for intact stability must ensure sufficient stability in all intact conditions of operation, while those for damage stability must ensure sufficient stability to keep the vessel afloat and allow time for safe evacuation of the passengers in all required cases of damage or inadvertent flooding. The putative 1988-built vessel was not available to examine for compliance with the standards as, contrary to the comment, it was never built; the only class of vessels it typifies is a class of vessels never built. Regardless, the fact that existing vessels cannot meet a new design standard does not in any way justify continuing to build new vessels to an old design standard that is grossly inadequate when a new standard can be easily incorporated into the design of new vessels. Most ``T-boats'' do not have lifeboats; but one existing domestic passenger vessel does have davit-launched lifeboats, and these regulations must consider all possible eventualities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Discussion of Major Changes Proposed Here <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The changes would incorporate a tiered approach to standards for damage stability, an approach based on a vessel's route. They would establish three categories: exposed waters, partially-protected, and protected. Definitions for these terms appear in &sect;170.050. On exposed waters, where a vessel could encounter the greatest force from wind and waves, the most severe standard would apply. On partially-protected and protected waters, less rigorous standards would apply. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This tiered approach would be manifest in two specific parts of the standard: in the range of positive stability beyond the damaged equilibrium angle that a vessel must attain and in the righting arm value that the vessel must attain. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A vessel on exposed waters would have to attain a range of positive stability beyond the damaged equilibrium angle of 15 degrees; on partially-protected waters, of 10 degrees; and, on protected waters, of 5 degrees. A vessel on partially-protected waters would have to attain a righting arm value of two-thirds of that for a vessel on exposed waters; and a vessel on protected waters, one of one-third of that for a vessel on exposed waters. The proposed rule would clarify what constitutes a new vessel. It would delete part of current &sect;171.080(e)(2). The opening paragraph of new &sect;171.080(f) now addresses downflooding and defines the use of weathertight and watertight openings. Paragraphs (4)(i) and (ii) of new &sect;171.080(f) now clarify placement of passengers for calculating heeling moments involving passengers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

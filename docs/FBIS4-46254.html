			<p>BFN     [Text] Beirut, June 3 (AFP)--Tens of thousands of angry  mourners took part in funeral ceremonies in Beirut and around  Lebanon on Friday for up to 45 Hizballah guerrillas killed in a  devastating Israeli air raid.    Hizballah Secretary General Shaykh Hasan Nasrallah told an  estimated 20,000 people in Beirut's Shiite Moslem southern  suburbs: "The (anti-Israeli) Islamic Resistance has been born  anew." [passage omitted]    Shaykh Nabil Qa'uq, a Hizballah official, said Hizballah was  determined to "strike Israel anywhere and at any time." [passage  omitted]    The Iranian-backed group said 26 guerrillas were killed in  the raid and 40 others wounded. But Lebanese Foreign Minister  Faris Buwayz put the death toll at 45 while hospital officials  in the al- Biqa' said 85 were wounded.</p>

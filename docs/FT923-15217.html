			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Letter: Macedonia by another name a step to avoiding bloodshed Sir, Edward Mortimer ('A Greek tragi-comedy', July 1) is badly frustrated by the EC decision to recognise the Republic of Skopje provided it chooses a name which does not include the term Macedonia. Mr Mortimer claims the recycled communists who govern Skopje have given assurances for not promoting irredentist claims and have even written them into the constitution. A careful look into its constitution proves the opposite: Article 3: 'The territory of the R of M is indivisible and unaltered. The existing borders of the R of M are inviolable. The borders of the R of M can change only according to the constitution.' Article 74: 'The Assembly decides for the change of the borders of the R of M with a two-thirds majority of the total number of representatives. The decision to change the borders of the R of M is adopted with a referendum if it is voted for by the majority of the voters.' These two articles together prove the expansionist nature of the Skopje leaders. If current borders are inviolable and yet they can change, then they could only be expanded. Could you imagine people voting to shrink their country? Article 49: 'The R of M cares for the status and rights of Macedonian people in neighbouring countries as well as immigrants from the R of M; helps their cultural progress and (develops) ties with them. The R of M cares for the cultural and economic rights of its citizens abroad.' This article sets the groundwork for the expansionism of articles 3 and 74. Mr Mortimer should know that the neighbouring countries of Greece and Bulgaria do not recognise the existence of so-called 'Macedonian' minority on their land. Mr Mortimer should study more thoroughly the ethnic salad of the Republic of Skopje. The name Macedonia cannot unify all the mutually hostile groups, but represents an attempt of a small ex-communist nomenclature to survive after the cold war with the facet of an irredentist 'Macedonian nationalism'. Acceptance of ethnic reality in Skopje by creating separated ethnic cantons, united by a name excluding the term Macedonia, would be the only solution to avoid bloodshed as in Bosnia-Hercegovina.

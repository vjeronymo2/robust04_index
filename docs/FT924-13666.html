			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / Survey of Devon (6): Dockyards in waiting - David White examines the core of the county's defence economy JUST LOOK at the pubs of Plymouth: the Navy, the Maritime Inn, the General Moore, the Lord High Admiral, the Admiral McBride, the United Services Inn. The place is riddled with military tradition. At the city council, Labour-led these days, the committee rooms bear names like Ark Royal and Temeraire. This is one of the areas of Britain most dependent on the armed forces and activities supporting them. But it is now fighting against the threat of losing much of its military role - decisions that could make its 300-year-old dockyard unviable and severely reduce its naval presence. The refit yard, owned by the government but run by a private-sector consortium, Devonport Management Ltd (DML), sprawls over 300 acres, across the river from Cornwall. The site, with its three miles of deep-water berths, is dotted with historic buildings, some refurbished, some standing empty. With the naval base - the two are located virtually on top of each other - it is the biggest complex of its kind in Europe. This is the core of Devon's defence economy. The Plymouth area accounts for some 23,000 Ministry of Defence salaries, This figure includes 5,000 dockyard employees, 3,500 civilians and 1,500 navy personnel at the base, some 3,000 Royal Marines, a commando regiment of Royal Artillery and about 7,000 sailors serving on Plymouth-based ships. Plymouth is the home port for, among other vessels, most of the navy's frigates and its largest squadron of nuclear-powered submarines. Various other defence facilities are scattered around Devon, including the Royal Naval College at Dartmouth, the RAF's Hawk training squadron at Chivenor in the north, and the Exeter headquarters of the locally-recruited Devon and Dorset Regiment, known to some as the Armoured Farmers. So far these have not been bitten by cutbacks under the government's Options for Change defence review, but others have. RAF Mount Batten, a one-time flying-boat base on a promontory on the edge of Plymouth Sound, is scheduled to shut down by the end of the year, with its combat survival school moving to St Mawgan in Cornwall. Closure of naval weapons facilities at Ernesettle, just up the River Tamar from the Devonport dockyard, will affect about half the 760 employees there. The dockyard itself employs less than a quarter of the workforce it had at the end of the second world war. In 1985 it still employed more than 13,000. Since then, 8,000 jobs have gone. After it was transferred to private sector-management in 1987, its workload fell faster than anticipated. Worse than that: reductions announced in 1990 in the navy's submarine fleet threatened its very livelihood. DML concluded there would no longer be a need for two UK facilities for refitting and refuelling nuclear-powered submarines, the backbone of the business both at Devonport and at Rosyth in Scotland. Rosyth, responsible for the work on all Britain's Polaris nuclear-missile submarines and about half the remaining nuclear-powered fleet, already had a project in hand for docks big enough to take the new Trident boats. The 'great nuclear race' was launched in May 1991, when DML sent an unsolicited proposal to the MoD and the Treasury. Its plan is a Pounds 200m development over 10 years, aimed at undercutting the cost to the government of going ahead with Rosyth. The plan uses mostly existing facilities. In addition to the two docks of Devonport's present submarine complex, DML plans to adapt for the purpose three huge dry docks which were designed before the first world war to accommodate battleships. A government decision on where to concentrate nuclear submarine work is expected by the end of the year, to be followed by moves towards further privatisation. In August the MoD invited companies to register interest in purchasing one or both dockyards. DML has succeeded in diversifying into a range of activities, from all-terrain vehicles to fire-protection panels. The 10 identical ocean-going yachts taking part in the British Steel round-the-world race are Devonport-built. The amount of work won by competition - as distinct from being allocated by the MoD - has risen to 22 per cent. A navy frigate in a covered dock stands side by side with the Sultan of Oman's royal yacht. But there is no escaping the overriding importance of the nuclear business. A submarine like Trafalgar - the first of the navy's most recent class of 'hunter-killer' boats, now in dry-dock at Devonport - represents up to Pounds 150m worth of work over 2 1/2 years. DML executives have studied the alternatives if the decision goes against Devonport, but have come up with a bleak picture. Mr Mike Leece, DML's managing director, says it might be possible to keep two naval dockyards. 'But one would be much reduced in size from now,' he says. Devonport needs the submarine activity to optimise its facilities and remain competitive. It has, says DML, less chance than the smaller Rosyth facility of surviving on surface-ship work alone. A recent study by Dr Paul Bishop of Plymouth University (the former Polytechnic South West) estimated that closing the dockyard and running down the base could cost 22,600 jobs, including many of the region's higher-paid industrial posts. The complex, he found, generated Pounds 52Im a year into the local economy of Devon and Cornwall, some 5 per cent of total income and 30 per cent of the Plymouth area's. Almost 30,000 jobs were supported by it, directly or indirectly, with 600 local companies receiving orders from the dockyard. It is little wonder, then, that Plymouth City Council, even with a Labour majority, should have cast aside any qualms about nuclear activities and thrown its weight firmly behind DML's case. Mr John Ingham, council leader, says the area's skill-base has already been badly affected by job losses at Devonport. 'We've had no favours from the MoD at all,' he complains. He cannot envisage 'the worst doomsday scenario' - complete closure not only of the dockyard but also the base. 'We wouldn't be able to stand the scale of that without some profound government help . . .The support we would need from central government would be quite astronomical.'</p>

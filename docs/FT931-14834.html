			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei index marks time as region moves ahead THE NIKKEI average closed marginally lower in thin trading ahead of a public holiday, but underlying sentiment remained gloomy, writes Bethan Hutton in Tokyo. The 225-share Nikkei lost 2.31 at 16,515.60, after trading in a narrow range around the 16,500 mark all day and setting a low for the session of 16,437.84 and a high of 16,568.98. Volume contracted from Wednesday's 203.4m shares to around 170m, as many investors stayed on the sidelines in advance of the long weekend. Declining stocks continued to outnumber gains, by 589 to 277, and 208 issues closed unchanged. The broader Topix index of all first section shares ended 3.55 points down at 1,267.91, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index edged ahead 1.32 to 1,029.86. Selling by specified money trusts was balanced by support buying from public pension funds and investment trusts when the Nikkei slipped below the 16,500 barrier. Events in the Gulf had little effect on the market, as the US strike against Iraq had been widely expected. Brokers said oil issues would not be affected unless more serious fighting broke out. Nippon Oil was unchanged at Y580.

Mitsukoshi slipped Y3 to Y727, Daimaru retreated Y11 to Y535 and Hankyu dropped Y47 to Y770. Small gains were seen in stocks expected to benefit from growing indications that an economic recovery is under way in the US. In particular, computer and electronics-related sectors drew some buying interest. TDK put on Y10 at Y3,500, Mitsubishi Electric firmed Y2 to Y472 and Matsushita Electric Industrial added Y10 at Y1,100, but NEC finished Y6 off at Y636. Producers of Interferon were hit by high volume selling for a second day on news that the Health Ministry wants to limit the drug's prescription for Hepatitis C patients. Sumitomo Chemical fell Y13 to Y418, after losing Y24 the day before, while its specialist trading affiliate Inabata dipped Y10 to Y1,050. Toray Industries dropped a further Y14 to Y615. NTT, the telecommunications group, weakened for the eighth consecutive day, closing Y4,000 cheaper at Y528,000 after low volume. In Osaka the OSE index declined 112.58 to 18,051.76, with 71.4m shares traded. Roundup SHRUGGING OFF events in the Middle East, most of the Pacific Rim region's markets improved yesterday. HONG KONG retained its impetus from overseas institutional investors, attracted by the colony's still-booming economy and low price/earnings ratios and less nervous over its political outlook than the locals.

Among the most active issues, HSBC finished 50 cents ahead at HKDollars 60.50, Hang Seng Bank 50 cents up at HKDollars 56.50 and Hutchison Whampoa 30 cents higher at HKDollars 16.50.

Malaysian motor shares were in focus after news that the government had eased financing rules for vehicle purchases. KUALA LUMPUR matched Singapore's interest in its own motor stocks, Tan Chong, UMW Holdings, Oriental Holdings and Cycle &amp; Carriage Bintang firming between 37 and 60 cents each as the composite index appreciated 5.53 to 619.81. TAIWAN was encouraged by expectations that parliament would pass legislation today or tomorrow reducing the stock transaction tax. The weighted index advanced 69.63, or 2.2 per cent, to 3,297.56 in turnover of TDollars 11.8bn. BOMBAY looked ahead to the February 28 national budget, rather than back at three days of riots, and the BSE index rose 39.11 to 2,459.67.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Slovak Deputy Prime Minister Roman Kovac gave a  news conference today in connection with his decision to resign.  [passage omitted]    [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Peter  Tomecek,  another member of the Alternative of Political Realism has left  your group. How do you see the future of this Alternative?    [Kovac] [passage omitted] I think that all of us who formed  the Alternative know that there is a need to clean up this  society, and I think they will maintain their position [on this  issue]. We will be short one person, but that does not matter.    [Correspondent] You said that you were preparing a new  political party. You have been having talks with various  parliamentary parties. There has been some information from the  lobbies that your views are close to that of Mr. Cernak [leader  of the National Democratic Faction in the Slovak National  Party]. Can you tell us more about the orientation of this new  political entity, or, in other words, with whom would you be  willing to cooperate?    [Kovac] The main reason for considering the creation of a  new  political party is the existence of a large group of citizens in  Slovakia who are dissatisfied with all of the existing political  parties. According to our analysis of public opinion, the main  reason for this dissatisfaction is the inability of political  forces to reach a sensible agreement. The political party we  have in mind is a party that should be a new beginning, or a  guarantee that a sensible political agreement is reached between  Slovak political forces. That is what Slovakia needs more than  anything at the present time.    [Correspondent] When will we hear more about it?    [Kovac] Maybe by the end of next week. [end recording]</p>

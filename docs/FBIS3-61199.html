Because despite the seeming simplicity of the  matter, it is not all that simple to divide up state property  without infringing upon the interests of both the individual and  the state as a whole, and without undermining the economic  foundations of the society in the effort. There can be no debate  that mistakes and a struggle between departmental, local and  group interests are not excluded on this road. All of these  "collisions" may be discerned at the Pavlodar Irtysh Joint-Stock  Company (formerly a meat-packing plant) and the Pavlodarmoloko  State Joint-Stock Holding Company (formerly an oblast dairy  industry association).    They became the first-born of denationalization in  Kazakhstan. Their experience was generalized at a republic  seminar. In what way is it valuable? First of all in that an  attempt was undertaken to combine the interests of meat and milk  producers with those of the processors of these products--the  meat-packing plants and dairies.    "In our joint-stock company," said Zaure Nurmukhanova, the  director of the Irtysh Joint-Stock Company, "there are presently  105 sovkhozes and kolkhozes. And each month another 5-6 farms  submit applications for membership."    Zaure Malgazhdarovna, might they be doing this out of  desperation? Who are they going to give their livestock to, and  where are they going to process the meat, if your enterprise  holds a monopoly?    "That's not at all the way it is. There's also the Ekibastuz  Meat-Packing Plant in the oblast, after all, and we don't  believe that we would have any serious competition if meat  packing plants and sausage-making shops were to be established  in the rayons. The simple fact is that our production is  well-tuned, the procedures are fully developed, and we make  maximum use of raw materials and by-products of slaughtering the  animals (horns, hooves, hides, internal organs, blood etc.).  Naturally the profit is larger as well. The stockholders  themselves control the schedule of animal deliveries and meat  prices, and determine the need for production renovation. With  Almaty's help we have begun construction of a new meat-packing  plant, and we are currently reorganizing the presently operating  one for the production of sausages and smoked meats. Together  with the oblasts's banks we have established a joint-stock  company for the production of lidaz and other medical  preparations. We have already erected the building frame, and  the heat will be turned on in the winter. Or here's another  example showing that we are taking over as the masters. As you  know, the price of water has gone up, which has reflected upon  product cost. So we drilled a well on the territory of the  packing plant. It seems like a little thing, but last year this  gave us a savings of 30 million rubles, while this year it will  be somewhere around 200 million. Let me say one more thing. In  the beginning some of the stockholders mistrusted us, and they  sent over their own observers to see if we butcher the carcasses  properly and if we are not hiding any of the meat products and  profit. Today there are no misunderstandings, and our partners  have persuaded themselves that we are working `for the same  pocket'."    But isn't there a merger of interests here between the  producers and processors at the expense of the customers?    "Are you referring to `jacking up' the prices? This also is  disadvantageous. First of all, given today's wages and the large  number of poor, the demand for meat products has fallen as it  is. Second, the oblast agricultural committee has worked out an  average purchase price for meat. The farms at which livestock  breeding is not very profitable need to think about how to  surpass this price. To be honest, though, disputes often arise  at meetings of the board of stockholders. Citing the high cost  of fuel, equipment and electric power, farmers demand a higher  price for the meat they deliver. And so I have to persuade them,  and at times prove by calculation, the such demands are unfair.  As an economist, I know that this approach is far afield of  market methodology, but the people couldn't withstand `shock  therapy'."    The Pavlodarmoloko State Joint-Stock Holding Company was  born  out of a conflict between two variants. The former oblast dairy  association was constituted of independent rayon and city  dairies, but they were bound together by shared economic  stimulation funds and capital investments.    "This," said Vladimir Samsonov, director of the  Pavlodarmoloko holding company, "allowed us to build a big plant  and a whole milk substitute shop in Pavlodar, a city dairy in  Ekibastuz and an ice cream shop in Aksu, and to renovate several  rural enterprises. According to the first variant our structure  should have remained as before, with the one difference that the  milk producers were to be included as stockholders. In the  second the rayon and city dairies would have separated from us  completely, and then joined the holding company on a voluntary  basis. I am not opposed to such independence in principle, but  many of them do not have the resources even to make the priority  payments, and they are putting no thought into renovation and  new procedures."    "Vladimir Yemelyanovich, isn't there a longing here for  the old methods of leadership?    "That's got nothing to do with it! I've been working in the  sector for more than a decade, and no matter what we are called,  no matter what structural changes we make, our task is to  process milk and get it to the customer. But now we've gotten to  the point were last year we had to import ice cream into the  oblast all the way from Rostov! Once I said to a certain dairy  director: `Can't you set up ice cream production at your dairy,  you do have vacant production space after all, don't you?' To  which he replied, `Excuse me, but I'm independent and I decide  for myself what I'm going to do.' All right, so let there be  `minor principalities,' but then let them also maintain their  businesses at the proper level, and not come to me with their  hands outstretched, asking me to pay their debts. Because the  only thing that they are really concerned about is increasing  their own wages."    Vladimir Samsonov also has his own opinion about mutual  relations with milk producers. Before, in the words of the  holding company's director, besides the basic taxes the oblast  associations commonly transferred a certain percentage of their  earnings to the producers. Now as much as 51 percent of the  profit goes to the farmers. And in order to increase their total  deductions, they inflate the prices of the milk they deliver. As  in the Irtysh Joint-Stock Company, disputes and mutual  reproaches are inevitable. Samsonov is making every effort to  hold back this price race, so as not to be left with unsold  goods.    It should not be thought in this case that Samsonov is a  conservative, or that he opposes a market economy. "I'm for it,"  he said at the beginning of our interview, "but on a civilized  basis, and in honest partnership." He and his colleagues are  seeking markets and the ways of making products cheaper and of  developing new procedures. Quite simply, he is deeply troubled  when he sees the tested system falling into ruin with the years,  and the processing sector failing to receive adequate attention  and priority consideration from either legislators or the  government, and how the race for independence is damaging the  overall effort. But Samsonov does have his opponents as well,  who are also certain that it is time to abandon gigantomania,  and to follow the example of developed countries by processing  milk and other products deep in the countryside, at miniplants,  thus reducing high transportation costs and product losses  during shipping and transloading.    Such is the content of the first experience of two Pavlodar  joint-stock companies. They are essentially in the first stage  of privatization, in which the state is providing support to  them: by owning the controlling block of stocks, by setting  prices, and by adopting particular decisions. But the  stockholders are displaying increasingly greater independence  and initiative. A contract system and testing of engineers and  technicians with the purpose of preparing a reserve of  middle-level executives were introduced at that same Irtysh  company at Nurmukhanova's suggestion, and a system of  stimulating the workers under which the theft of meat, which was  a phenomenon of epidemic proportions in former years, would  decline is operating. And as Zaure Malgazhdarovna said, the  workers themselves come to her and suggest particular  innovations and ideas helping to increase profit. And little by  little Samsonov is breaking down the psychology of rising  prices, persuading people that income could also be increased by  selling relatively inexpensive products--that is, by hastening  money turnover. The advantages of joint-stock ownership are  already making themselves evident here. But there are many  questions as well. No matter how you look at it, joint-stock  companies--both producers and processors--are still monopolies.  They dictate prices to the purchasers of their products. And the  latter are forced to take them, because there are no serious  alternatives in the oblast to the joint-stock companies. On the  other hand, were we to do away with them all at once, we could  be left with an unworkable situation in which small producers  are unable not only to fight for a place in the market but even  to maintain themselves. But that is how things will turn out if  the state fails to adopt a multiprofile program for the  development of processing industry, and if it does not accept  the responsibility of supporting small processing enterprises  for some period of time. After all, given the 10 percent  profitability established for processors, they will not survive  in the face of the current price gap between industrial and  agricultural products. Moreover a large part of the expenses of  the farmers has been transferred to the republic's citizens in  the form of legalized deductions from the profits of holding  companies, because in purchasing the milk and meat, the citizens  are the ones who create this profit. This is perhaps an item of  interest for the Antimonopoly Committee.    In short, things are not all that simple. Nonetheless,  privatization has begun in the processing sector, and it must be  brought to its logical conclusion, as was done in economically  developed countries. Producers and processors have not yet  become the full masters of their production operations, but they  are striving for this.</p>

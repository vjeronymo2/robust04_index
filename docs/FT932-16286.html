			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equities suffer from Wall Street blues THE FALL-OUT from Wall Street's 68-point Dow slide last Friday ensured another dismal performance by London's equity market yesterday. The FT-SE 100 Index ended a disappointingly slow session, the last of the financial year, a net 31.1 lower at 2,838.8, its third successive decline. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index performed slightly better, ending 17.7 down at 3,090.8. But worries that Wall Street could have been heading for further substantial pressure yesterday proved unfounded when the US market opened some eight points higher before slipping away later in the session. Taking its cue from Wall Street, which had plummeted on news of an imminent tobacco price war and a worrying fall in US bond prices, the Footsie opened more than 23 points lower. Much of the early pressure was triggered by the futures market, although dealers noted that activity in that area was relatively thin. An early attempt at a rally saw the Footsie claw back some early weakness, reaching what turned out to be the day's best level, down 14.8, within an hour of the opening. Thereafter, share prices did little more than drift easier in extremely subdued trading. Even the better than expected showing by Wall Street failed to shake London from its torpor. At its worst, shortly after Wall Street began trading, the Footsie was down 34.8. Turnover yesterday was a disappointing 437m shares, one of the lowest levels since the turn of the year and almost certain to drive the value of customer business below the Pounds 1bn mark. The value of customer business in the market last Friday, in spite of the effect of the railway strike, was a healthy Pounds 1.47bn. Dealers said yesterday's fall in the FT-SE 100 was slightly misleading. 'The market does not feel under too much pressure,' commented one leading marketmaker. Another remarked that yesterday was one of the quietest trading sessions this year. He also pointed out that today's Jewish Passover holiday would affect the level of business in the market for the next couple of days. Bank lending and money supply data, released in mid-morning, was said to have been in line with expectations and had little effect in the market. Gilts dipped around  1/4 at the long end, while index-linked were  1/16 easier. BAT Industries shares continued to slide, with analysts reducing profits estimates after last Friday's shock news that Philip Morris is launching a substantial price-cutting initiative. The banking sector was looking vulnerable after last week's suspension of Queens Moat Houses, with Barclays notably weak following a bearish note issued by stockbroker Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken. Shares in the UK's leading bookmakers fell across the board after Saturday's Grand National fiasco. Only 10 Footsie stocks managed to close in positive territory, with Wellcome, devasted last week by worries over its anti-Aids drug Retrovir, staging a good rally. Mirror Group was an outstanding performer, with the market more than pleased with the outlook for the newspaper group. A handful of leading UK retailers recorded modest rises on the session, while Pilkington and Hepworth moved up as the market responded to speculation that MB Caradon could be about to launch a sizeable bid in the building sector.</p>

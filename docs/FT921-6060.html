			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar in volatile trading THE DOLLAR settled in the day's mid-range yesterday after a volatile but ultimately indecisive session. The markets were presented with mixed US economic indicators. Higher inventories pushed the fourth quarter US gross domestic product growth up to a revised 0.8 per cent from 0.3 per cent. But the Chicago Purchasing Management index showed a seasonally adjusted fall to 48.0 per cent, from 49.2, its lowest since last June. Mr Michael Feeny, a senior dealer at Sumitomo Bank, said: 'There has been underlying strength in the dollar during the week, but sentiment has weakened.' Traders said the dollar was boxed in between well-defended support and resistance levels at DM1.63 and DM1.66 respectively. The dollar closed at DM1.6375, against DM1.6440 on Thursday. It had started the day by testing support at DM1.6300 but recovered to a DM1.6450 high by mid-session after Mr Hiroshi Yasuda, Japanese deputy finance minister, said the G7 may not intervene in the market as long as currency movements were not drastic. Traders said his comments had come at a particularly sensitive time as the G7 deputy finance ministers were meeting yesterday and today and currency policy was believed to be on the agenda. Intervention by the Bank of Japan alone has tended to be unsuccessful, but after US treasury undersecretary Mr David Mulford said on Thursday he was not worried about the level of the dollar, it appeared unlikely the Japanese would win the assistance of the US in coordinated action. The dollar still dropped back slightly against the yen, to 129.00/10, from a start of 129.25/35. In Tokyo, it had closed at 129.33 after quiet trading. The D-Mark rose slightly against the EMS currencies, after the decline in the dollar, and held its gains on the Swiss franc despite moves by the Swiss National Bank to shore up short-term money rates. It also gained against sterling, largely due to the continued decline of the peseta. The Spanish currency, stuck at its limits earlier this week, eased amid talk that more Spanish rate cuts are on the way and that it may soon enter the ERM's 2.25 per cent band. The peseta was at 5.77 per cent above its pivot against sterling, down from 5.95 per cent on Thursday, lowering the effective floor for sterling within the system. Sterling remained slightly above the floor, prompting some dealers to suggest that an imminent UK base rate may not yet be out of the question. It closed at DM2.8778 after a 2.8816 start and 2.8867 close on Wednesday. It ended little changed against the dollar at Dollars 1.7580, compared with Dollars 1.7575 on Thursday.</p>

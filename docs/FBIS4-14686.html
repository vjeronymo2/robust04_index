			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By unidentified ITAR-TASS correspondent] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 2 Apr -- Several staff members of the DPRK  Embassy in Moscow attempted last Wednesday to unlawfully acquire  items of military equipment, an ITAR-TASS correspondent has been  informed by competent sources. It is a matter precisely of  items of military equipment and not of a list of Russian-made  armaments, as reported by the Japanese ASAHI newspaper.    Contrary to that newspaper's claims, the embassy staff  members were not arrested, since they enjoy diplomatic immunity.    As far as the essence of the incident is concerned, a  statement is expected on the matter within the next few days  from the public relations center of the Russian Federal  Counterintelligence Service.</p>

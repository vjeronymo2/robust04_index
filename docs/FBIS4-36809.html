			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by 'Abdallah Hammudah: "In Exclusive Statement to </F> AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT Shabwah Governor Says: I Invite Lakhdar  Brahimi To Ascertain Our Victories. I Am Finding Difficulty in  Compelling Tribes To Stop Fighting"]    [Excerpts] London -- Shabwah Governor Ahmad Farid  al-Suraymah has said: "I am complying with the cease-fire and  Security Council Resolution 924 in my capacity as governor and  military governor of Shabwah Governorate. However, I am finding  difficulty in controlling the Shabwah tribes and compelling them  to comply with this resolution since they have begun to pursue  the northerners."    He said this over the telephone from his command post in  'Armah (one of the directorates in Shabwah Governorate). The  governor promised to exert his efforts to achieve discipline  among the tribes. But he said: "It is a difficult task. It is  a popular resistance, and I advise Brother President 'Ali  'Abdallah Salih to withdraw the remnants of his forces from  Shabwah, otherwise I will not be responsible."    The Shabwah governor stressed that he is now at the  approaches of 'Ataq, capital of the governorate. And that the  distance between him and it does not exceed 20 km. He added  that his forces have recaptured most of the governorate's  territory, except some five square km in the city of 'Ataq  itself. And that he has achieved total control for the southern  authorities over the cities of Nisab, al-Musayni'ah, and 'Armah.  [passage omitted]    The Shabwah governor said that he had invited Lakhdar  Brahimi, envoy of the UN secretary general, to visit the  governorate "in order to ascertain that we are in control of  more than 90 percent of its territory. We are awaiting him."  He added that this "refutes (President) 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's  allegation that Shabwah is under his control." [passage omitted]</p>

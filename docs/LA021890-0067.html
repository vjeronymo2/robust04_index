			<p><P> February 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'FILTHY LUCRE';  </P> <P> POMONA COLLEGE LECTURE SERIES LOOKS AT GREED THROUGH THE AGES  </P> <P> Farewell -- thou art too dear for my possessing,  </P> <P>  And like enough thou know'st thy estimate.  </P> <P>  -- William Shakespeare, Sonnet 87  </P> <P> This was no ordinary lecture on The Bard. Sure, it took place at Pomona  College. And yes, some students did take notes. But the whimsical nature of the  talk was evident from the first, when English professor Martha Andresen strode  up to the podium and said:  </P> <P> "We hear in Shakespeare's Sonnet 87 his mastery of the 'drop-dead-you-creep'  poetic style."  </P> <P> She then launched into an often funny and always pointed analysis of how the  themes of usury, money and love intertwined in the writings of William  Shakespeare.  </P> <P> It was part of a weekly lecture series called "Filthy Lucre," in which  professors from various disciplines look at humanity's lust for money through  the ages.  </P> <P> Last week's talk, on the eve of Valentine's Day, just happened to focus on the  juxtaposition of money and love.  </P> <P> What makes the topic so salient today?  </P> <P> "Greed . . . and the 'filthy lucre' approach to life is in the air," says Anne  Bages, the Pomona College professor who chairs the Tuesday luncheon series that  started in 1975.  </P> <P> The idea is to encourage faculty members as well as students to view an  individual topic through many different lenses. In the 1990 series, that topic  happens to be the filthy lucre, or riches, first described in the New Testament  of the Bible by the Apostle Paul in letters to his disciple Timothy.  </P> <P> A Feb. 27 discussion by Alma Zook, an associate professor of physics, will  discuss filthy lucre in terms of the cold fusion controversy and recently  purported attempts by scientists to falsify data in the pursuit of fame and  fortune.  </P> <P> On March 20, Paul Hurley, an assistant professor of philosophy, will tackle  junk bonds when he discusses "The CEO as Strongman: The Fiction of Managerial  Accountability."  </P> <P> Bages says timely resonance was added to the series by Wednesday's announcement  that the parent firm of Drexel Burnham Lambert, the once mighty ruler of the  junk bond market, had sought protection under U.S. bankruptcy laws.  </P> <P> Hard-core devotees, who include students and faculty members from some of the  adjoining Claremont colleges, say the series allows them to delve into issues  for which they might not have a forum in the classroom.  </P> <P> For instance, Andresen says she might spend two weeks going over Shakespeare's  "The Merchant of Venice," but that she probably wouldn't devote a whole lecture  to usury.  </P> <P> "This is a way to move from an academic discipline to address a larger moral  and social problem," Andresen says. We don't want to be isolated in an ivory  tower and these public lectures are an opportunity to reach out and apply what  we know."  </P> <P> And it is not always achieved in an orthodox fashion. Most people would look at  usury through an economic, historical or maybe even a moral context, Bages  says.  </P> <P> "Putting it in a poetic framework makes it more appealing," she admits.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, Scott Warren, associate dean of students and assistant professor of  government, will discuss "Marx, Money, Marriage." The series continues each  Tuesday at noon through March 27, when the final topic will be "The  Institutionalization of Greed: East vs. West" by David Arase, assistant  professor of government.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NHTSA estimated that installation of the required technology in the cars and light trucks not voluntarily equipped by the rule's effective date would prevent an estimated 50 to 100 child-injuring rollaway accidents annually. The agency stated that these injuries could be prevented at a relatively low cost. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On February 2, 1993, Mazda submitted a petition for rulemaking requesting that the agency amend the provision added by the May 1990 final rule. That company claimed that an amendment was needed to clarify the requirement to make the compliance test procedure ``objective.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mazda stated that, in a December 12, 1992 letter, NHTSA had notified it of an apparent noncompliance with Standard No. 114. By way of explanation, the agency had sent Mazda a copy of a November 20, 1992 interpretation letter to Ford. That interpretation letter was a response to a Ford letter written to NHTSA concerning a compliance issue for certain of its keylocking systems which had been designed by Mazda. In its petition, Mazda stated that it was aware of at least five other manufacturers which had been informed of apparent noncompliances with that same provision of Standard No. 114. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In its November 20, 1992 interpretation letter to Ford, NHTSA rejected a request by that company to interpret Standard No. 114 to prevent key removal only when the transmission shift lever is in one of the available gear positioning detents other than ``park,'' i.e., reverse, neutral, drive, first, or second, and not when the lever is at points between those detents. The agency stated that following: We cannot agree with your suggested interpretation, as it is inconsistent with the express language of S4.2.1. That section states that, with certain exceptions not at issue, the key-locking system must prevent removal of the key unless the transmission or transmission shift lever is locked in ``park'' or becomes locked in ``park'' as the direct result of removing the key. Stated more simply, key removal must be prevented in all circumstances save those specified in S4.2.1. Neither the transmission nor the transmission shift lever is locked in ``park'' when the lever is between the gear selector positioning detents. Therefore, under section S4.2.1, key removal must be prevented in that situation, unless the transmission/transmission shift lower becomes locked in ``park'' as a direct result of removing the key. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In its petition, Mazda characterized the agency's interpretation as permitting ``intentional mispositioning'' of the transmission shift lever during compliance testing. That company argued that during the design and development of the vehicles which are the subject of the agency's December 1, 1992 letter, it never understood ``intentional mispositioning'' to be a reasonable and legitimate means for testing compliance with Standard No. 114. It also argued that even if it had such an understanding, it is not at all clear what kind of certification test procedure it would have used to assure that key removal could not occur in any possible situation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mazda also argued that it had reexamined the rulemaking record and found nothing to indicate that ``intentional mispositioning'' of the transmission shift lever was ever contemplated. In addition, Mazda alleged that even if this is now believed by NHTSA to be an appropriate aspect of the performance required by the standard, the absence of an objective test procedure for determining compliance with the standard results in a lack of objectivity and fails to satisfy the requirements of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mazda requested that Standard No. 114 be amended to incorporate a provision that it considers to set forth an objective performance requirement. The provision would specify testing with the transmission level in each detent position, and moving the lever from detent position to detent position using force levels specified by the manufacturer. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA rejects Mazda's claim that the existing provision in Standard No. 114 is non-objective. There is nothing subjective about a requirement that a key-locking system must prevent removal of the key unless the transmission or transmission shift lever is locked in ``park'' or becomes locked in ``park'' as the direct result of removing the key. As discussed in the agency's interpretation letter, key removal must be prevented in all circumstances save those specified in S4.2.1. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While the agency rejects Mazda's objectivity argument, NHTSA does believe it is appropriate to address in rulemaking whether Standard No. 114 should be amended along the lines suggested by that company, albeit for different reasons. In the preamble to the May 1990 final rule, the agency stated that it believed the injuries in question could be prevented at a relatively low cost to manufacturers since most vehicles would already comply with the amendments. This belief was based on the fact that the vast majority of vehicles with automatic transmissions already had transmission locking systems or had already been scheduled to have newly designed systems installed. The agency assumed that all of those locking systems were or would be designed in a manner that would comply with the requirements. However, it now appears that some of these transmission locking systems do not comply with the requirements. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

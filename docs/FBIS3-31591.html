			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Regular interview with Slovak Prime Minister Vladimir </F> Meciar by Martin Bartisek; place and date not given--recorded]    [Excerpts] [Bartisek] [passage omitted] This week's events  in the Slovak National Council were very meaningful. But we are  not here to comment on them in the literal sense, although their  progress has disturbed citizens to a certain degree. There now  exists only the possibility of a referendum, since the  government and deputies have failed to have their proposals  passed on shortening the term of office. Mr. Prime Minister,  what are your next steps in this direction?    [Meciar] Today, nobody doubts anymore that there is a  parliamentary crisis here. We must do everything we can to  avoid this developing into a government crisis. This  parliamentary crisis can be resolved in two ways. I consider it  fundamental for citizens to support a referendum through the  petition documents. Of course, there is a chance that the  opposition will propose a petition, by means of a decree by the  republic's president, that would also support a referendum, but  with a different content and as late as possible. Between these  two proposals--that of the government and that of the  opposition--it seems on the surface that it is only a period of  a few months. No, it is a question of one year of economic and  social life. If the country and political life are not speedily  stabilized, the loans will be delayed, they will be made  conditional on still further compromises, there will be a  slowdown and an end to foreign help and investment, we will  become untrustworthy in the context of privatization, and we  might find ourselves in a situation where the economy and  stability of prices and other things is split to such a degree  that the citizen would have to pay. The citizen has the right  and duty to avoid this development. [passage omitted]    [Bartisek] Mr. Prime Minister, you put forward a proposal to  dismiss Roman Kovac, saying that his post would not be filled  again. Does this mean that the complex of issues he is  responsible for will be spread among others, or does it mean  that four deputy prime ministers are really a sufficient number  now?    [Meciar] My proposal views the solution as one of personal  attitude toward the program and the movement. It is obvious  that Cabinet members who join a conspiracy to prepare a new  Cabinet cannot stay on in this Cabinet. I am waiting for the  president's reaction, I have not heard from him yet.    The fact that for the time being I will not appoint anybody  to the post of deputy prime minister does not affect the number  of posts; it is a matter of political anticipation. I am aware  of the fact that I have to reach an accord with somebody.  However, those I will reach an accord with will ask for an  appropriate representation in the Cabinet. This means I am  keeping the door open for future talks and for future decisions.  I think we will not have to wait long for such talks, for such  decisions.    I am concerned about the possibility that the opposition  will  engage in piecemeal tactics in parliament, dismissing one  Cabinet member after another. This would lead to further  instability and might lead to a crisis within the Cabinet, were  Cabinet members to stop being flexible [zatali by sa] and not  prepared to continue their work under such conditions.    I cannot fail to see that the president is also hinting at  something that does not necessarily seem to be going in the  direction that he outlined on 1 January 1994. The development  should be normal, it should lead to the stabilization of our  state, and it should finally allow us to concentrate on positive  work instead of fighting each other. Fighting for what? For a  failure? For the failure of our state? That would be the  failure of all of us. Thus, I am inclined to expect from the  opposition a change of attitude and statesmanlike wisdom.    [Bartisek] Have you not revealed too many of your cards now?    [Meciar] I have revealed only some, but without having  something more in reserve I would not tell you this.    [Bartisek] At its meeting yesterday the National Council  passed the heavily debated bill amending the present law on the  privatization of big enterprises. Some parliamentary deputies  have described it as being consistent since it combines positive  aspects of the government's draft with positive aspects  submitted by the opposition. This amendment should be close to  being perfect. This is why it would be interesting to know  whether you will sign the bill.    [Meciar] We shall first examine the bill. It is 99 percent  certain that the government will return it to the National  Council by way of the president. The duty to sign the bill will  arise only after it has been debated once again. The bill  contains certain matters that have not been thought through  properly, and we, therefore, regard it as correct that the  National Council should again discuss comments the government  will make. I expect that these discussions will lead to me  being able shortly to introduce to the public the new minister  for privatization, since in the original version of the bill  there was not going to be a Ministry for Privatization at all.  This is why it was logical for us to expect that after the  final standpoint was clarified an appointment might be made.  There is no longer any doubt at present that the opposition too  is interested in maintaining the ministry, and one fundamental  obstacle to an appointment has, therefore, been removed. My  hands shall, therefore, be somewhat freed for political work.</p>

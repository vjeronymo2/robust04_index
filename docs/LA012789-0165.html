			<p><P> January 27, 1989, Friday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> JUDGE CURBS TV IN STEINBERG CASE  </P> <P> An angry judge today limited television coverage of the sensational case of  Joel Steinberg, the disbarred lawyer accused of murdering the 6-year-old girl  he raised, as jurors deliberated Steinberg's fate for a fifth day.  </P> <P> "This looks like a construction site!" roared Milton Williams, deputy chief  administrative judge for New York City courts, as he scanned the packed  hallways of state Supreme Court, where hordes of media awaited the verdict. "I  want my courthouse back," Williams said, looking over the 20 television cameras  and about 80 reporters, producers, photographers and camera crews that have  been covering the 13-week-long trial which has become a national symbol of  child abuse.  </P></p>

According to the statement, President Kravchuk told a  meeting  with newsmen initiated by "Radio Liberty" and "Der Spiegel"  about the situation in the country and said he considered his  participation in the early presidential elections scheduled for  June 26 1994 inexpedient.    Taking into account that the president's opinion has been  widely commented on by both Ukrainian and foreign mass media,  the press office points out that "this position of Kravchuk is  caused by the specific situation in society and the state system  today and prognoses of its short-term development."    The press office said the president motivated his decision  by  the fact that the period remaining until the elections is very  short. "It cannot be ruled out that the process of electing and  forming the supreme power bodies, both executive and  legislative, may exceed the time limits set and overlap with the  early presidential and local elections," the statement  stipulates.    "This may lead to vacuum of power, when the Supreme Soviet  is  already no more, while a new one has not been created, a cabinet  of ministers which could assume entire executive power has not  yet been formed," according to the statement.    Under such circumstances, only the president can  effectively exercise his powers. However, if he allows the  elections at the moment, executive structures may break up and  the control of the country lost, the statement stipulated.    "This is the president's main argument," the press office  said.</p>

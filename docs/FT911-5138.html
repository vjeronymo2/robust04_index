			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / International Company News: Net slides at Montedison power unit SELM, the power generating subsidiary of Italy's Montedison group, reported group net profits of L92.3bn (Dollars 74m) last year against L132.8bn in 1989. However, extraordinary items in 1989 inflated group earnings, the company said. In 1989, the sale of activities to the Enimont chemicals joint venture then owned by Montedison and state-owned Eni, generated a capital gain of L90.1bn. Those divisions made net profits of L26.3bn that year. Adjusted for the disposals, group net earnings in 1989 amounted to L16.3bn, according to Montedison. Sales last year rose 5 per cent to L486.3bn from an adjusted L462.9bn. Selm, which specialises in hydro-electric power and has some thermally-generated electricity, is planning to change its name to Edison, the former title of the private electricity group from which Selm stems. The company is paying a dividend of L70 and L90 for each ordinary and savings share respectively.</p>

			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (10): London tumbles from a Budget-day peak LONDON'S EQUITY market began the new year much as it had behaved for most of 1991: on a rising trend and full of optimism. Responding to this bullishness, the FT-SE 100-share index bounded ahead to reach 2,574.8 on March 10, Budget day, its highest point since November last year. Thereafter, it never stopped falling, eventually closing the three-month period some 53 points, or 2.13 per cent, lower. The reasoning behind the UK market's enthusiasm was easily pinpointed. Apart from the driving force of a strongly rising Wall Street, there were various ultimately incorrect assumptions. The big institutions bought the market on hopes of early signs of economic recovery, which would be followed by interest rate cuts. The rate cuts would help fuel consumer demand and business confidence, which in turn would be reflected in an upturn in the political fortunes of the Tories. They would produce a tax-cutting, vote-catching budget, followed by a general election victory. Reality proved otherwise. Chancellor Norman Lamont's Budget was so badly received that the market promptly slumped over 52 points in a single session, its heaviest one-day fall since last year's failed coup in Russia. The City was alarmed at a public sector borrowing requirement of Pounds 28bn, substantially in excess of the most pessimistic forecasts. The announcement of the general election followed within 48 hours, and the market had to face the prospect of an election with UK interest rates above 10 per cent and with the likelihood that they would need to rise even more in the not too distant future. The damage wrought by the recession continued to manifest itself in a constant stream of disturbing statistics on the economy. Gross domestic product fell 2.5 per cent in 1991, the biggest year-on-year fall since 1933, and the longest post-war sequence of quarterly falls. The quarter did produce some big surprises on the takeover front. The on-off romance between Midland Bank and Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corporation saw the two banks betrothed - but the marriage not so far consummated. The rest of the bank sector was deeply troubled, as worries emerged about property developers Olympia &amp; York and Heron Corporation. A number of cash-raising exercises materialised, notably Thorn EMI's Pounds 516m rights issue to help finance its purchase of Virgin Music from Mr Richard Branson. ECC asked its shareholders to stump up Pounds 214m to enable the group to redeem Dollars 350m of Auction Market Preferred stock in the US. Corporate results, for the most part, were as expected. Composite insurers were horribly mauled by mortgage indemnity losses. Royal omitted the final dividend. Lonrho's dividend cut, sharply lower profits and a series of asset sales saw the group's share dropped from the Footsie list of top 100 shares. Politics aside, other factors will increasingly come into play as the year progresses. Strategists have been highlighting the effects on equities of the sharp rise in PSBR for the foreseeable future. JP Morgan, the US investment bank, says: 'The return to large-scale gilt issuance will pre-empt cash which would otherwise have gone into equities.' County NatWest, meanwhile, forecasts rights issues of Pounds 11bn over the coming 12 months. Some analysts argue, however, that market valuations look increasingly supportive of equities.</p>

			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: UK accounting Mr David Tweedie, head of the Accounting Standards Board, is canny enough not to fight more than one revolution at a time. The market is still coming to grips with the new shape of the profit and loss account under FRS3, so this week's discussion document on the balance sheet is modest by comparison. The proposal that companies should undertake regular revaluations of properties, marketable securities and long-term stocks is little more than an overdue rationalisation of the current hodge-podge of current cost and historical cost valuations. Even so, companies will no longer be able to hold properties on the balance sheet at depressed historical values with an eye to realising a windfall profit on disposal. Regular asset valuations may also mean higher depreciation charges and, therefore, lower profits. That might sound like a field-day for surveyors and other professional valuers. The eventual standard must strike a balance between the need for accurate financial statements and the cost of preparing them. But the market should expect a more radical reshaping of the balance sheet in coming years. Revaluing property and securities while leaving plant, machinery, liabilities - and, controversially, acquired goodwill - at historical cost is inconsistent. By turning its back on a US-style system of pure historical cost, the ASB may have signalled its intent. Next week's proposals on acquisition accounting will go one step further by asking companies to revalue acquired liabilities. With the ASB due to tackle the vexed topic of goodwill later this year, the market should be braced for more upheaval.</p>

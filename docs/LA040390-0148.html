			<p><P> April 3, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BOYS' ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: PEREZ'S DUAL ROLE MAKES HIM THE TALK OF THE MOUND  </P> <P> Like many pitchers, Harvey Perez of Saddleback High School talks to himself on  the baseball mound. But because Perez is also a catcher, few bring such a rare  perspective to the conversation.  </P> <P> "If I think I'm getting out of control, I'll circle the mound and get down on  one knee and talk to myself," Perez said.  </P> <P> Perez, The Times' Athlete of the Week, didn't have to say much Wednesday, when  he held Newport Harbor hitless until allowing a single in the seventh inning.  </P> <P> He also had two hits and four runs batted in the 7-1 Sea View League victory.  </P> <P> Friday, Perez the catcher threw out two runners attempting to steal second base  in a 5-3 loss to Tustin.  </P> <P> This dual role is a new one for Perez, who played shortstop for Saddleback most  of last season. He pitched in only one game and played a couple of games at  catcher at the end of the season.  </P> <P> But this season, Perez, the senior captain who is batting .452, has been  required to do more, and has showed some improvement.  </P> <P> "He's got a ways to go because he's still trying to learn the (catching)  position and it's a hard position to learn," said Saddleback Coach Bob Mangram  said. "But he works hard at it."  </P> <P> Before the one-hitter last week, Perez hadn't been satisfied with the way he  has handled himself on the mound, despite an 0.88 earned-run average. "I was  just catching so much that I really wasn't thinking about pitching," he said.  </P> <P> TOP PERFORMERS  </P> <P> Mark Gonzales of La Habra won the 3,200 meters (9:32.68) and the 800 (1:59.30)  and was named the athlete of the meet at the Valencia Invitational Saturday.  </P> <P> Greg Pearce pitched a four-hit shutout as El Toro defeated Mission Viejo, 2-0,  Monday and pitched two scoreless innings and earned a save Friday in a 4-1  victory over Capistrano Valley.  </P> <P> Mark Parlin won the shotput (56-10 3/4) and the discus (161-5) as Esperanza  defeated El Dorado, 101-29, in an Empire League track and field meet Thursday.  Friday, he won the discus (171-5 1/2) at the Tustin Relays and Saturday he put  the shot 53-9 to win the event at the Bishop Amat Invitational.  </P> <P> Karl Van Reusen and Steve Snyder of Edison each had 17 kills as the Chargers  defeated then-No. 1-ranked Huntington Beach in a Sunset League volleyball  match.  </P> <P> Harvey Perez  </P> <P> Saddleback High School  </P> <P> * Position: Pitcher/catcher  </P> <P> * Height, Weight, Class: 5-11, 170, Senior  </P> <P> * Last Week: Perez pitched a one-hitter and had four RBIs in a victory over  Newport Harbor Wednesday. Friday, he threw out two runners trying to steal  second.  </P> <P> * Season: Perez has an 0.88 earned-run average and is batting .452.  </P></p>

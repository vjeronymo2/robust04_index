			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Charities watchdog tells Oxfam to keep out of politics TRUSTEES of the charity Oxfam were told yesterday to stop mixing political campaigning with charity work. They were warned that they may in future have to reimburse funds which are wrongly used for political purposes. A report by the Charity Commission, after a year-long inquiry prompted by concerns over an Oxfam campaign about South Africa, concluded that the trustees had occasionally exceeded the charity's objectives and had stepped outside the law restricting charities from undertaking political activities. Mr David Forrest, secretary of the commission, said in a letter to Mrs Mary Cherry, chairman of Oxfam's trustees: 'The commissioners require the trustees to accept that some of their current campaigning work is political and not charitable. The unacceptable political activities of the charity must cease.' The commissioners said they had considered asking the trustees to reimburse money that had been wrongly used for political purposes, but decided the trustees had acted in good faith. They warned that they would not hesitate to seek reimbursement in future. 'The trustees do not appear to differentiate between stating a possible solution to a problem in reasoned fashion and campaigning to have that solution adopted,' Mr Forrest said. He said the commissioners could not accept Oxfam's arguments that its political activities used up only a small part of its resources. Mrs Cherry said the report would have serious implications for all UK-based charities whose work involved an element of political campaigning. Oxfam was committed to working within the law, Mrs Cherry added. However, she said: 'Our primary object of relieving distress and suffering cannot be achieved without advocacy on behalf of the people we are trying to help'. The Charity Commissioners first received complaints in December 1989 and January 1990 about an Oxfam campaign on the Khmer Rouge and Cambodia.</p>

			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / International Company News: CRA beats forecast in first term CRA, the Australian resources group, said yesterday that better than expected metal prices and favourable foreign exchange rates lifted net profit above company forecasts to just under ADollars 100m (USDollars 76.9m) in the first quarter to the end of March. Mr John Uhrig, chairman, told the annual meeting CRA was forecasting full-year profits at about the same level as last year, when the group made a net profit of ADollars 350m, down 26 per cent on the previous year. Mr Uhrig said the outlook for the year was uncertain. 'Nobody knows how long increased metal supplies from Russia will continue to depress metal prices,' he said. He said it was also unclear what the implications of a forecast contraction in Japanese economic growth would be for CRA's iron ore, coal and aluminium businesses. However, Mr John Ralph, chief executive, said profits were above forecasts for the first four months and that the board might have have been 'a bit conservative' in forecasting prices. Mr Ralph said CRA had predicted an average Australian dollar value of 77 US cents, compared with the current level of about 75.5 cents. He said the lower rate would translate into an extra ADollars 25m in net profits if it were maintained over the rest of the year. Poseidon Gold (PosGold), part of Mr Robert Champion de Crespigny's Normandy Poseidon group, reported a 13 per cent improvement in net profits to ADollars 21.7m for the nine months to the end of March. The improvement was achieved in spite of lower gold prices and a first-time tax charge of Dollars 30m following the introduction of corporate taxation on gold mining. PosGold said the result did not include ACM Gold, which was acquired following a joint takeover with Western Mining Corporation of Australian Consolidated Minerals.</p>

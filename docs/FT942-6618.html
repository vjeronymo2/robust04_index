			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Arts: An Irishwoman in crisis After Easter, now in its premiere performances with the RSC at Stratford's Other Place, is about Northern Ireland, religion, family, mourning and a disturbed female psyche. Written by Anne Devlin, it is an interesting, entertaining, serious, ambitious mess. In particular, it is about Greta, a former Catholic from Northern Ireland. Married, with children, to an Oxford academic, she has entered a crisis that is not merely marital but also psychological, spiritual, religious. 'He thought he was marrying a radical emancipated woman,' she remarks. 'Instead he gets a Catholic mystic.' The play overdoses on wrily comic remarks, and some of its characters are all too inclined to Irish cuteness. Why, since it begins and ends with Greta's spiritual quest, does Devlin drag in so much gratuitous material? In several scenes she allows Greta to become a supporting character without fully focusing on anyone else. Both Catholicism and Northern Ireland become large and arresting subjects (as when Greta sees Pentecostal visions, or when three British soldiers threaten her brother Manus at gunpoint) but then slide out of view. And why on earth - towards the play's close, and when all the family is hiding under the table in case a bomb falls - does Devlin suddenly have Manus tell his mother that he is gay? It's not as if we ever see him again. This kind of extraneous detail feels like sheer nervousness on Devlin's part, and so does some of the comedy, cracking jokes rather than holding to serious subjects. Stella Gonet, far from The House of Elliott, is Greta. People who only know her on screen will not know what extraordinary charm she has in a theatre. The light in her eyes, the bloom on her cheeks, the breadth of her smile, the musicality of her utterance - these make an effect in live performance that captivates. She makes me want to say, like an American tourist, 'Oh, just go on talking.' But this very charm, though often invaluable, is probably what holds her back from real distinction as an actress. Greta's pain and trauma fail to grip. Devlin must take part of the blame for this. So must Michael Attenborough, who directs. He allows Ann Hasson to play Greta's sister Aoife ('I don't have affairs, I have phone numbers') as a cute comic stereotype of Irish domesticity far too long. When finally she has to break out into a certain dark aggression, we cannot believe the change. Katharine Rogers, as their sister Helen ('I don't have visions, I have sex'), muddles effectively through a complex but under-written role. The play falls apart into a series of individually good moments. When Greta, distracted, has sat down alone in the road in front of an English bus, she observes that her action would have been accepted as a gesture of protest, not of mental disturbance, if performed by a whole group. 'It confirms what I've always suspected - that the difference between politics and insanity is one of numbers.' Later, still psychologically erratic, she distributes communion to an Irish bus-queue, and the police hold her until persuaded she is not politically motivated. 'In England they'd keep her if she's mad and let her go if she's political,' remarks Helen. 'In Ireland they keep her if she's political and let her go if she's mad.' In repertory at the The Other Place, Stratford-upon-Avon.</p>

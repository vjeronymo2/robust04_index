			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / International Company News: IBM unveils large disk drive products International Business Machines yesterday announced a family of innovative, large-scale computer memories which it hopes will regain it the initiative in the big disk drive business. The world's largest computer manufacturer invented disk storage more than 30 years ago but its revenues from storage systems have been declining, although it is still the dominant supplier. It is also facing fierce competition. IBM's latest storage systems are designed for mainframe computers and feature high security and protection against failure. Called the Ramac Array Family, they use a technology called Raid (redundant arrays of inexpensive disks). IBM claims the drives are the first high-end disk storage systems coupling high performance with fault tolerance. A Raid system is a set of small low-cost drives which appears to the user as if it were a single, expensive drive. The IBM drives have been developed to the highest level of performance and reliability, known as Level 5. According to IBM, the new drives take up only one-third the floor space and use half the power and cooling of conventional mainframe disk storage. The technology involved in Raid drives, while simple in principle, is complex in practice. Storage Technology has only just launched its own Raid system code-named Iceberg after several years of delayed development. 'While other storage vendors have sought to develop systems aimed at high availability or high performance, we have taken the lead in providing what our customers need by providing both,' said Mr Bill Nelson, director of marketing in IBM's storage systems division.</p>

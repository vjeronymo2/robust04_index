			<p><P> April 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WOLF THAT ATE SAN FRANCISCO;  </P> <P> WOLFGANG PUCK DOESN'T HAVE TO CALL ALICE WATERS LONG-DISTANCE ANYMORE  </P> <P> Midnight and the bar is packed. Wolfgang Puck is drinking Champagne in his  brand-new restaurant and looking around with a bemused smile. Isn't this the  city that sleeps? Why aren't all these people in bed? Just then a man walks up,  taps him on the shoulder and says: "I'm from L.A., but I've been living in San  Francisco. I'm just so glad to finally see some L.A. style up here."  </P> <P> But you don't have to be from L.A. to love Puck's new place. Postrio is the  toast of the town.  </P> <P> And everybody seems surprised. They shouldn't be: Puck hasn't missed yet. First  Spago went global when it opened in Tokyo. Then Puck branched out and opened  Chinois in Santa Monica. His assault on the supermarket came next as the  Wolfgang Puck Food Co. started manufacturing frozen pizzas and desserts for  home consumption. Puck's got cookbooks and videos, a regular slot on  television's "Good Morning America" -- and two new restaurants in the works.  </P> <P> Next year, Malibu residents will be able to stop commuting to Spago when  Granita opens at the beach. He's even got the beer bunch in mind: Puck is a  partner in the Los Angeles Brewing Co. which will open this fall in West Los  Angeles. But all that's in the future: Right now Puck and his partners are  pursuing San Francisco.  </P> <P> "I thought I was gonna have to beg people to come in," says Puck. "I thought  we'd do about 50, 60 dinners to start. I was so apprehensive. You know how  people in San Francisco hate Los Angeles."  </P> <P> Yes, they hate it so much that at the ripe old age of one week Postrio was  already being hailed in the San Francisco Chronicle as a "masterpiece." Hate it  so much that Puck has become a local celebrity. Hate it so much that Postrio,  in Puck's words, "is a nightmare. It's worse than Spago. It's already booked  through June."  </P> <P> What is going on here? San Franciscans have traditionally turned up their noses  at Los Angeles. They think that everything about their city -- the air, the  ambiance, the scenery -- is better than it is down south. And when it comes to  food, Los Angeles can't touch San Francisco. Just ask any San Franciscan. So  why is San Francisco eating up Puck's new restaurant?  </P> <P> San Francisco restaurateurs would certainly like to know. "Why is it," asked  one, "that some guy can blow in from out of town, open a place and get all the  media attention and rave reviews right out of the box? Some of us have to work  for years before we get any notice at all. What's Puck got that we haven't?"  </P> <P> "Glitz," says San Francisco Chronicle food editor Michael Bauer. "People here  are starved for that bit of glitz that Wolf is bringing with him."  </P> <P> 'I should have worn my gold lame," says one diner, looking wistfully at the  impressive stairway by which Postrio's diners make their entrance. "I've never  had a place to wear it before." She's got a place now -- and San Francisco  residents are reveling in it. The stairway is a dramatic device that offers  everybody the opportunity to be a star. People dress up just to come sweeping  down the stairs, pausing in mid-flight to survey the room -- and let the room  survey them. "Everybody in the restaurant looks like they came from L.A." is  what people in San Francisco say.  </P> <P> The glitz factor is shared by the room itself. And this despite the fact that  it was not designed by Puck's wife, Barbara Lazaroff, but by San Francisco  designer Pat Kuleto (who is also responsible for the Fog City Diner). He has  employed a ribbon motif that threads its way through the rug, down the stairs  and, without interruption, right onto the marble floor. Brass ribbons on the  banisters and on the huge, luminous light fixtures pick up the theme. The room  is so wrapped up in glittering ribbons that it looks like one great big  birthday present to the city of San Francisco.  </P> <P> The art is pretty glitzy, too. This is not your ordinary restaurant mood stuff.  A significant Sam Francis adorns one wall. An enormous Rauschenberg is splashed  across the other. How did they come by such major works? "Oh," says Puck  nonchalantly, "I called Bob (Rauschenberg) up and asked if he had something I  could use for that wall. He said: 'You're a friend, I'll make something.' Now  I'm afraid to call and find out what it costs."  </P> <P> This is heady stuff for a town where people still strut around the streets in  Birkenstocks. But Postrio isn't all glitz; the people who come here may dress  like stars -- but their tastes are very down to earth. "People in San Francisco  eat and drink a lot more than they do in L.A.," says Anne Gingrass, the former  Spago chef who now shares the position of head chef at Postrio with her  husband, David. "People sit down and eat all evening. Three- and four-course  meals are common." They not only eat more -- they eat differently. "We sell  things here," says David, "that you couldn't sell in L.A. to save your life."  </P> <P> That may be, but if you've been to Spago, there's not much on this menu that  will come as a surprise. Before the restaurant opened, Puck went around saying  that the food at Postrio would be "updated San Francisco classics." He must  have changed his mind, for this food is unadulterated L.A. -- pretty pure Spago  with a pinch of Chinois thrown in for good measure. The biggest seller is the  Chinese style duck; a spicy mango sauce barely differentiates it from the one  that's served at Spago. The lobster with fried spinach leaves closely resembles  a dish that's served at Chinois, and appetizers include a very familiar  marinated tuna with avocado and a lime ginger vinaigrette. There are, of  course, the designer pizzas, including Puck's signature "Jewish pizza" topped  with smoked salmon, creme fraiche and golden caviar. San Franciscans like the  pizzas so much that, despite the fact that they are sold only in the bar, they  are selling at the rate of 200 a day.  </P> <P> Sausages sell well too. Postrio makes lamb sausage for the pizzas, duck sausage  with pistachios for a lunch entree, sweet herb sausage for pastas and  home-cured salami for an appetizer plate. "We never sold much sausage at  Spago," says David Gingrass, "people down there don't eat anything with  saturated fat. But here we sell so much sausage that I had to hire one guy just  to make it. Veal, on the other hand, which sells well in L.A., you can't sell  at all in San Francisco."  </P> <P> At the moment, though, it seems as if there is nothing that Wolfgang Puck can't  sell to San Francisco. People are here at 7 a.m. gobbling up homemade corned  beef hash, Hangtown Fry, buttermilk pancakes with blueberries. And they are  still here at midnight eating desserts and pizzas. Is Puck really surprised?  </P> <P> Probably not. Long before he even thought of opening a restaurant in San  Francisco he said, "You know, sometimes publicists call up and want to know if  I want them to work for me. I ask them how much they'll pay me. 'No,' they say,  'you don't understand, you pay me.' I say, no they're the ones who don't  understand. Think how good it would be for a publicist to say that he worked  for us. It would make his business." Nobody understands the meaning of  celebrity better than Wolfgang Puck.  </P> <P> Now he says, "The thing about San Francisco is that they're more star-struck  here than anywhere." Puck's genius lies in being the first to recognize this  fact. Just as he was the first to recognize that people in Los Angeles were  tired of stuffy French restaurants. When Puck opened Spago, he changed the way  Los Angeles goes out to eat. And now he's out to do the same for San Francisco.  "He's added a whole different personality to the San Francisco dining scene,"  says the Chronicle's Bauer, "and I think it's going to have a major effect  here."  </P> <P> Just now the restaurant is only a couple of weeks old. And at the moment  Wolfgang Puck does not look like anybody who is anxious to have a major effect  on anything. It is 1 a.m., he has been at the restaurant since 8 a.m. -- and he  looks tired. "I must be getting old," he says, "I never used to get tired." He  looks around the room, shakes his head -- and remembers that they start serving  breakfast in six hours. "We even do a big breakfast business," he laments.  </P> <P> * BOOM TOWN: But how is the food? Why are several fancy restaurants opening in  S.F.? Pages 98, 99.  </P></p>

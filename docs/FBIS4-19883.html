			<p>BFN     [Text] Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos commented  in Thessaloniki today on the prime minister's [U.S.] visit. Our  correspondent Foivos Karzis has the following report.    [Begin recording] [Venizelos] I believe that the statement  made by President Clinton to the journalists is satisfactory  with regard to all the issues concerning us -- that is,  primarily on the Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia--FYROM] issue, Greek-Albanian relations, the  Patriarchate's position, and the prospects of the Cyprus issue.  It is a significant fact that President Clinton recognizes the  Greek sensitivities and, if you like, the soundness of the Greek  position and that he attaches so much importance to Cyrus  Vance's mission and that of Matthew Nimetz, who will be coming  to supplement the Vance mission.    [Karzis] On Albania, Athens is waiting for the upcoming  crucial Papoulias-Serreqi meeting while taking continuous steps  to protect the Greek minority.    [Venizelos] The protection of the Greek minority's rights is  a self-evident prerequisite, respect for international law and  human rights is non-negotiable; and this, of course, concerns  all the levels at which this issue is raised.    [Karzis] Concerning Greek-Turkish relations, Mr. Venizelos  said that Greece must be sparing and careful when referring to  Turkey's internal political problems. However, he pointed out  that Ankara is trying to export these problems.    [Venizelos] What concerns us about the recent local  elections  in Turkey is that we hope there are no provocations, no  violations of international law, and that the historic existence  and international status of the Ecumenical Patriarchate is  respected.

			<p><P> January 24, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> BEATHARD TAPS REDSKIN TALENT;  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL: CHARGER GENERAL MANAGER HAS TURNED TO HIS OLD TEAM, WASHINGTON,  TO HIRE BILL DEVANEY AS DIRECTOR OF PLAYER PERSONNEL.  </P> <P> Bobby Beathard announced the first addition to his staff and it should surprise  few that the Chargers' new director of player personnel is from his old team --  the Washington Redskins.  </P> <P> Bill Devaney, a college scout for seven years with the Redskins, Tuesday was  named to the position. He joins Beathard, the team's general manager, and Coach  Dan Henning as former Redskins now with the Chargers.  </P> <P> Devaney said the opportunity to be reunited with Beathard, with whom he worked  for six seasons before Beathard took a one-year job with NBC Sports, and his  increased responsibilities with the Chargers were instrumental in his decision  to leave the Redskins. But he said a commitment from Charger owner Alex Spanos  to build a winner also was an important consideration.  </P> <P> "Bobby and I have had a lot of fun working together," Devaney said. "We've done  some good things, and that was a big part of my decision. But I really like the  100% commitment Mr. Spanos has made to winning. We had that in Washington, and  we know how important it is to be able to pull any string, do whatever it  takes. That makes our job so much easier."  </P> <P> Devaney said his duties will include overseeing the college and pro scouting  departments. He said his first priority is to help the team prepare for the  start of the two-month Plan B free agent period that begins Feb. 1, when teams  are required to submit a list of 37 protected players to the league.  </P> <P> Devaney, 34, joined the Redskins as a full-time scout in 1983. Devaney grew up  in central New Jersey and was graduated from Elon (N.C.) College, where he was  co-captain of the football team.  </P> <P> He replaces Chet Franklin, who was fired along with Steve Ortmayer, the general  manager, and most of the rest of his staff.  </P> <P> The future of special teams coach Joe Madden was uncertain after Charger  officials said they met this week with Larry Pasquale, special teams coach of  the New York Jets, about a possible coaching position.  </P> <P> Pasquale was to have returned to his New York home Tuesday night after spending  two days meeting with Charger officials. But team spokesman Bill Johnston said  no job was offerred to Pasquale and that Madden was in his office working on  Tuesday.  </P> <P> Johnston would not comment on Madden's status. Madden has one year remaining on  a two-year contract.  </P> <P> Neither Pasquale nor Madden could be reached for comment.  </P> <P> Madden had a difficult time in his first season with the Chargers. The Charger  special teams had a poor start in a 40-14 season-opening loss against the  Raiders, averaging eight yards on seven kickoff returns, including a muff that  led to a safety. It was only a signal of more trouble to come.  </P> <P> The most costly special teams mistakes came in the sixth game against Seattle  when the Chargers lost, 17-16, after an extra point and potential 51-yard  game-winning field goal were blocked in the final minutes.  </P> <P> The special teams did have some highlights, particularly the kick returns of  Anthony Miller, which included a 91-yard touchdown return in a 14-12 victory in  the rematch against the Raiders. But the Chargers finished the season below the  NFL average in most categories and were near the bottom in kickoff and punt  return coverage.  </P> <P> Madden, 54, was hired by the Chargers last February after spending three years  away from football. It was his first NFL job since 1986, when he was an  administrative assistant for the Falcons when Henning coached at Atlanta.  Madden previously was the special teams coach at Detroit from 1980-84, where he  succeeded Pasquale after he moved to the Jets.  </P> <P> Pasquale's status with the Jets has been in limbo since the team fired Coach  Joe Walton after the season.  </P> <P> Pasquale has a year remaining on his contract but, along with the other Jet  assistants, has been given permission to talk with other teams, a Jet spokesman  said.  </P> <P> But the spokesman, public relations assistant Brooks Thomas, said Pasquale has  been encouraged to interview with whomever is named the new coach.  </P> <P> Pasquale, 48, has coached 11 seasons in the NFL, the past 10 with the Jets  after one season with Detroit. He joined the Jets as receivers coach in 1980  but moved to special teams the next season.  </P></p>

			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / The BMW/Rover Deal: Conservative backbenchers express concern - Political Storm Many Conservative backbenchers voiced concern at the sale of Rover to BMW. Mr Simon Coombs (Swindon) urged Mr Tim Sainsbury, minister for industry, 'to learn a lesson from the fact that there is no potential British purchaser of this excellent company'. He urged the Department of Trade and Industry 'to try to work out why that is the case?'. His view was echoed by Mr John Butcher, (Coventry South West) who said many people in the Midlands were 'anxious about the sale' and wanted reassurances about the deal. Sir Teddy Taylor, (Southend East) said it was regrettable that the sale was completed without the consent of Honda, which still controls 20 per cent of Rover. He asked Mr Sainsbury to ensure the link between Honda and Rover was maintained. Mr David Tredinnick (Bosworth) raised the possibility that BMW may want to build BMW cars in Rover plants. Mr Sainsbury said ownership of Rover was a low priority compared to the profitability of the company. However, worries over the foreign ownership of the last big British car company were taken up by Labour. Mr Richard Caborn, Labour's chairman of the all-party Commons trade and industry select committee asked if the government was concerned that the lack of finance going into British manufacturing 'is forcing our best companies to sell sectors off'. Mr Robin Corbett, Labour MP for Birmingham Erdington, said he was not against 'sensible partnerships' but takeovers like this had got to be bad news. 'I think it is very sad after the way management and workforce at Rover worked their socks off that British Aerospace can simply chuck them overboard because they are a bit short of money.' But MP Dennis Skinner, (Bolsover) described the deal as an outrage which would finish off the British motor industry. The government should step in and stop it, he said, adding: 'There will be no guarantees for these jobs once the Germans take over. There will be no guarantees about the Rover marque. And in a few years' time the British car industry will be gone, like the motor-cycle industry.' Mr Robin Cook, Labour's shadow industry spokesman, said: 'What is quite clear from today's purchase price is BMW has paid four times the amount for which this government sold Rover group only five years ago. 'That clearly confirms the Audit Office's view that the price they got for it was a rip-off of the public sector and the taxpayer.'' Mr John Carlisle (C Luton North) declared an interest in that he had sold Rover cars through his company to both sides of the House 'and indeed taken inquiries for BMW from the other side on frequent occasions'. He asked if BMW would preserve the Rover dealer network 'and make sure therefore that the excellent deals Rover have offered to members of this House and outside are still available'. Mr Sainsbury replied: 'I can assure you it is the intention of BMW that Rover will continue to offer excellent deals to all its customers, whether in this House or outside.' Pressed further by Robert Ainsworth (Coventry North East) on what guarantees BMW had given on jobs, the minister insisted: 'No company is going to invest Pounds 800m to bring a business to an end.</p>

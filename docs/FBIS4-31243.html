			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Jacek Kuron, Union of Freedom activist and </F> former labor and social policy minister, by correspondent  Andrzej Sondej; place and date not given]    [Text] [Sondej] How do you assess the Union of Freedom's  position on the political stage? After all, just before the  unification of the Democratic Union [UD] and the Liberal  Democratic Congress [KLD], some people said that a union with  the Liberals would cause the UD to shift to the right.    [Kuron] When discussing the position of various political  groups on the left and right sides of the Polish political  stage, we must first determine where the front and back of that  stage are placed. That is why I do not use the left-right  criterion for defining political positions. For me, the basis  for such a definition is a given group's attitude to the tenets  of the market economy and to public expectations and ambitions.  As a result of the transformations that have taken place in the  country to date, two camps have emerged, which can be  designated, in jest, as the friends of the market and the  friends of the people. UD was characterized by considerable  sensitivity to social issues, while the KLD attracted a large  number of pragmatists who understood very well that no one can  introduce free market principles against the wishes of the  population. The unification itself could, of course, lead to a  reinforcement of promarket sympathies and a weakening of social  concerns. In other words, friends of the market will gain  domination over friends of the people. This can happen, but it  is not inevitable that it will happen.    [Sondej] Are you not afraid that the Union of Freedom has  lost a proportion of its electorate, the one hailing from UD,  and that, consequently, competition for councillors' seats in  the forthcoming local government elections will end in a failure  for your new party?    [Kuron] I believe that the unification itself will not have  affected our chances too strongly. Electoral coalitions were  formed in individual parishes prior to the UD-KLD fusion. What  is more, in some parishes the Liberals would not have gone to  the polls alongside the UD activists in any case. Certainly the  change of the party's name will to some extent do harm to our  chances in the election. It is as if, immediately after a major  promotion campaign to advertise the "Mazowszanka" mineral water,  I were to change its name to "Warszawianka." Nevertheless, at  the local level, the majority of contending parties have adopted  their own names in the elections, and the Union of Freedom name  and logo will not influence them in any decisive way. Even so,  we must always calculate which move will be more advantageous.  Politicians must be aware of the possibility that, even if  their vision gains acceptance, they may still lose the  elections. We must recognize this possibility: It is the  fundamental duty of every person who chooses to be involved in  politics.    [Sondej] But you yourself decided not to put down your name  as a candidate for a position in the national leadership of the  united party. Some members of the Union of Freedom leadership  team maintain that you intend to run for the presidency in the  proposed 1995 election.    [Kuron] Not at all! I am not interested in winning the  president's seat. I want to continue to be actively involved in  politics, and I have a program that will make it possible for  Poland to overcome the present crisis. Consequently, I want to  be prime minister. It is a natural thing for a politician who  is active in the political arena to want to become prime  minister: If he does not, it means that he chose the wrong  profession. I have a vision of creating a kind of "politicians'  roundtable" at which people committed to politics would together  work out a compact on the ethical principles of their policies.  Social dialogue should constitute the foundation of Polish  politics. Only in that way can we accomplish the task of  transformations in our country. I believe that this vision  could lead me to the prime minister's position--although that is  not inevitable. I will not take umbrage and go away sulking if  someone else is chosen to realize my program. The president  embodies the dignity of the Republic's statehood and is  therefore obliged to strive for the stabilization of the  political arena. He must not in any circumstances engage in  pursuing active politics.    [Sondej] Thank you for talking to us.</p>

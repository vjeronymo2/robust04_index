			<p>BFN     [Text] At the House of Representatives' Budget Committee  meeting in the morning of 8 June, Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa  touched on possible enactment of emergency laws in the event the  UN Security Council decides to impose sanctions against North  Korea over the issue of nuclear arms development and said: "It  will depend on contents of sanctions. We have to decide at that  time whether we need to enact emergency laws." In this way, he  explained his understanding that emergency laws will be needed  depending on the contents of the Security Council's sanctions.    Regarding a possible case of preventing, as part of the  sanctions, people from sending money from Japan to North Korea,  Takatoshi Koto, director of the Ministry of Finance's [MOF]  International Finance Bureau, said: "We treated cases in the  past in line with the contents of the [UN] resolutions by  issuing MOF notifications on the basis of the Foreign Exchange  Control Order." In this way, he suggested that the MOF will deal  with the issue of remitting money to North Korea by issuing its  notifications. They made these remarks in response to questions  asked by Shozo Kusakawa (of Komeito) and Hidenao Nakagawa (of  the Liberal Democratic Party).</p>

			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / Finance and the Family: The heavy cost of sending money - A look at the best - and worst - ways to transfer money abroad TECHNOLOGY for sending money to people overseas is still in its infancy. If you are carrying a plastic card while travelling, cash services available are endless. The past year's turmoil on the foreign exchange markets has demonstrated how easy it is for large companies and financial groups to transmit money across national boundaries. But for individuals sending small amounts overseas to friends or family, money transfer is disquietingly expensive. The Consumers' Association experimented last year by sending 160 payments of around Pounds 100 each between banks in 11 European countries, using both telex and mail transfers. They were so alarmed by the results that they called on the European Commission to intervene on consumers' behalf. Charges were excessive at an average of Pounds 13, with a maximum of Pounds 35 representing up more than a third of the money being sent. Average transfer time was eight days, and three transfers were lost altogether. According to the CA: 'Six months after they were sent (and paid for), the banks still say they can't find them. As the law stands they don't have to pay us any compensation.' Transfers are charged on complicated sliding scales, and banks may make different charges according to the currency you are using. Several banks are developing international networks, which go a long way to solving the problems. But these are still small, and cannot offer the comprehensive service available via credit cards for those making payments. Banks which have worked on this include the Co-operative, which charges a flat Pounds 5 fee (even to those who do not have an account with the banks) to use its Tipa-net system. This is a collaboration between co-operative banks in France, Belgium, Germany, Italy and Canada - it does not cover any other countries. The number of working days to process the transaction can be guaranteed in advance if both you and the recipient have accounts with the banks involved. However, the system can be used at the same cost, but with the possibility of longer delays, if neither has a Co-op account. Payment in cash is recommended. Girobank offers transfers into girobank accounts in 16 other countries for a flat fee of Pounds 2, and can also provide foreign bank cheques for a flat Pounds 5. Royal Bank of Scotland offers IBOS (Inter-Bank Online System) with Banco Santander in Spain and BCI in Portugal. This guarantees a 'same-day' transfer, for a minimum charge of Pounds 6 and a maximum of Pounds 12). You need to direct the money to an account with the recipient bank in Spain or Portugal for the system to work. The system hopes to expand into France. Other ambitious 'same-day' services come from American Express and Western Union. The Amex 'MoneyGram' is not restricted to its cardholders and allows you to send up to Dollars 10,000 to an American Express service centre in another country. The funds can be picked up by the recipient in cash, or travellers' cheques. If you and the recipient are near Amex service centres (of which there are 12,000) this is one of the most convenient ways of sending money in an emergency. However, it is expensive. For amounts between Dollars 100 and Dollars 300, the fee is Dollars 35. For figures above there is a sliding scale, with a maximum of Dollars 200 for sums between Dollars 7500 and Dollars 9800. Western Union offers a similar same-day service. If you want to send money, telephone their toll-free number (0800-833833). This will give you the address of your nearest agent, where you go to deposit your money (either cash, bankers' draft or building society cashiers' cheque). The money can then be made available to anyone producing the necessary identification at any of 20,000 WU agents across the world. Again, the service has a heavy price. Transfers up to Pounds 25 will cost Pounds 8. A sliding scale leads to a maximum charge of Pounds 105 for transfers between Pounds 2,500 and Pounds 3,000. Eurocheques offer good value for small payments within Europe, according to the Consumers' Association. The Eurocheque can be sent by post and the recipient then pays it into their bank account. Charges are around Pounds 2 for a payment of Pounds 100 and the account will normally cost about Pounds 5 to open. Other methods include currency drafts or mail transfer. If you opt for the currency draft, you post it to the recipient yourself, who then can encash it. International Money Orders, usually available only in sterling or US dollars, work in the same way and tend to be slightly cheaper. Mail transfers are done by the bank. For greater safety, and expense, you can use a telex transmission. For this you will need full details of the destination bank account. Charges for standard drafts from high street banks are: Barclays offers Barclaydraft in 21 currencies to its own customers, and is available for amounts up to Pounds 5,000. There is a flat rate charge of Pounds 11. Others can have International Money Orders in dollars or sterling only up to Pounds 5,000, for a cost of Pounds 7 up to Pounds 1,000, and Pounds 11 for amounts above this. Lloyds has a minimum charge of Pounds 15 and a maximum of Pounds 50 for currency drafts. The basic fee within these limits is 0.3 per cent of the amount sent. Midland charges a flat Pounds 6 for drafts up to Pounds 100, and then 0.5 per cent, with a minimum of Pounds 10 and a maximum of Pounds 32 for larger figures. National Westminster charges a minimum of Pounds 7.50 and a maximum of Pounds 50 for foreign currency drafts.</p>

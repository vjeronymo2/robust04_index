			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / UK Tories win Euro embrace from centre-right LEADERS of the Christian Democrats, the main centre-right group in the European Parliament, have agreed to a cautious political convergence with British Conservative MEPs. In Brussels on Saturday party chiefs of the Christian Democrat European People's Party (EPP) welcomed the request by Tory MEPs to join the EPP in Strasbourg as 'allied members'. They agreed to set up 'a consultation committee' with the Tory MEPs to thrash out agreement on such thorny issues as monetary union and EC social policy, with a view to the European Democratic Group (composed of 32 British and two Danish conservatives) joining the EPP in one year in a 'federation of groups' in Strasbourg. EPP leaders said they hoped that this would lead the British conservatives - at a national, not just European parliament, level - 'even closer' to them by the Euro-elections in 1994. This tentative response to the Tory MEPs, who have been banging on the EPP's door since losing heavily to Labour in the 1989 Euro-election, was a compromise. Germany's Chancellor Helmut Kohl, whose friendship with Prime Minister John Major has led him to champion UK admission, expressed satisfaction. Spanish, Portuguese, Greek and Luxembourg leaders also backed early Tory integration. But this was strongly opposed by the Dutch and Belgians, with the Italians hesitant. The reason for the antipathy of Low Countries' Christian Democrats to the Tories is not only that they are frequently in ruling coalition with socialists, as at present: they also have large affiliated trade unions, which dislike Tory opposition to the EC Social Charter. Prime Minister Wilfried Martens, the Belgian prime minister who is the EPP president, none the less paid tribute to Mr Major for his 'very open attitude' to negotiations on political and monetary union.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Political Spring Chairman Andonios Samaras has asked  the government to stop the simple representations and bring the  issue of Greek minority arrests in Albania to international  human rights organizations. At the same time, he called on the  government to exclude Albania from all financing or aid supplied  by the European Union.    A statement issued by the KKE [Greek Communist Party]  Central  Committee Press Office stresses that there is concern over the  fate of the Greek minority in Albania. The statement adds:  Following the recent intervention by the United States in  Greek-Albanian relations with its report on the issues of the  Greek minority, nationalist and chauvinist circles have felt  that there is freedom of action. The [Albanian President Sali]  Berisha government has capitalized on U.S. intervention and  support with the expansion of arrests of Greek Albanians. The  KKE has protested the systematic attempt to spread instability  in the Balkans and all those who support it by participating in  or being driven to nationalist and chauvinist actions.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 21 (KCNA) -- The great leader  President Kim Il-song gave on-the-spot guidance to the Kumdang  Cooperative Farm in Onchon County, South Pyongan Province, on  June 19.    He was accompanied by So Yun-sok, chief secretary of the  South Pyongan Provincial Committee of the Workers' Party of  Korea [WPK] and chairman of the South Pyongan Provincial  People's Committee, So Kwan-hi, secretary of the WPK Central  Committee, Kim Won-chin, chairman of the State Agricultural  Commission, Kim Nak-hui, chairman of the South Pyongan  Provincial Rural Economy Committee, and other officials  concerned.    The cooperative farmers of Kumdang reaped a high yield of  grain last year by strictly applying the chuche farming method  of the WPK, and they have become able to look ahead to a rich  harvest this year through vigorous efforts to increase the grain  output.    President Kim Il-song got first-hand knowledge of crop  conditions, going round the fields of the farm and noted with  deep satisfaction that the agricultural working people of the  Kumdang Cooperative Farm had created good crop conditions by  concentrating every effort on farming in hearty response to the  party's agriculture-first policy. To do a successful farming  is most important in resolving the problems of food, clothing  and housing, he said, adding that the agricultural working  people must do all farm work on a scientific and technical basis  as required by the chuche method of farming, deeply conscious  that they are responsible for the rice granaries of the nation.  He said various kinds of fertilizers must be applied to crops  in a rational ratio in order to increase the grain output.    He praised the Kumdang Cooperative Farm for effectively  irrigating nonpaddy fields with the introduction of various  economic and rational methods of irrigation. All the  cooperative farms must mobilize all the irrigation facilities to  supply enough water to maize and other crops, he added.    He said that in order to increase agricultural production,  the leading officials of agriculture must enhance their role and  the industrial sector must supply larger quantities of farming  materials to the countryside.</p>

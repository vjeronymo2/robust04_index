			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / More aid sought for Welsh coal areas THE GOVERNMENT is to seek further aid from the European Commission for the depressed coal-mining areas of Wales. This is on top of the Pounds 17.8m released by Brussels earlier this week, Anthony Moreton writes. Mr David Hunt, Welsh secretary, met Mr Bruce Millan, EC commissioner for regional policy, on Thursday in Brussels when it was indicated that an application for a further Pounds 10m would be 'looked on favourably'. Mr Hunt said qualifying projects had been drawn up by the Welsh Office. 'We have a long list of schemes ready to be put into Brussels as soon as we get the nod.' The government backed down on Monday from its previous stance that European regional aid should go to the Treasury to help finance schemes already authorised in Britain. Mr Millan had refused to release Pounds 120m to Britain for more than 50 projects unless he received an assurance that European finance would be used in addition to anything the government might spend.</p>

			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Hosokawa still voters' favourite The popularity of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa's cabinet continues to defy economic gravity, according to a poll published yesterday. A survey of 2,149 people by the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper gave the cabinet 73.5 per cent support. This is up a fraction from a month ago, during which time Japan's recession has deepened. The public shows no signs yet of blaming the divided seven-party coalition for failing to respond to widespread calls for a decisive step, such as an income tax cut, to stimulate the economy. The prime minister's own party, the Japan New Party, saw a nearly full percentage point increase in popularity from September to October, to 15.5 per cent, making it Japan's second most popular party. This is likely to reflect the straight-talking Mr Hosokawa's personal appeal, rather than his party's policies. The JNP supports liberalisation of the rice market, controversial with a large slice of the electorate, and otherwise pursues much the same policies as the opposition LDP. Over the same period, the LDP's popularity has risen slightly from 23.8 per cent to 24 per cent, the highest score by a single party. This suggests, oddly, that the LDP has lost no support as a result of its humiliating defeat over the government's political reform plans in the lower house of parliament, two days before the Yomiuri poll was taken. In an indication of just how fluid Japanese politics has become since the LDP's fall from power last July, yesterday's poll shows that 35.2 per cent of respondents support no party.</p>

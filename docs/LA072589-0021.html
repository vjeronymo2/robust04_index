			<p><P> July 25, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> LANCASTER COUNCIL UNANIMOUSLY VOTES TO GIVE ITSELF 20% PAY RAISE  </P> <P> Lancaster City Council members voted unanimously Monday to give themselves a  20% pay raise that will take effect next April.  </P> <P> With no discussion, council members voted to raise their salaries from $500 to  $600 a month, citing a state formula they said bases compensation for part-time  council members on city population. The council became eligible for the $100  monthly increase once the population exceeded 75,000 residents, city officials  said.  </P> <P> State law requires that the raise not become effective until after the next  election, which is scheduled for April 10.  </P> <P> Like many other issues in the Antelope Valley, the raise for the part-time  council was generated by the area's rapid growth. Lancaster grew 10% last year  to its present size of 82,200 residents. Council members have said that the  enormous amount of growth in the past several years has placed considerable  demands on their time.  </P></p>

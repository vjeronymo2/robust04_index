			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] Our parliamentary  correspondents, Jarmila Tosecka and Dagmar Bazlikova, have  details on the parliament's deliberations.    [Bazlikova] The first point on the agenda was the proposal  of  the former government, the government of Vladimir Meciar, on 8  March to recall Marian Tkac from his post of vice governor of  the National Bank of Slovakia. One of the reasons stated was  the fact that Tkac had been positively vetted--that is, that he  was accused of having cooperated with the StB [the former secret  police].    The noteworthy fact about this proposal to recall the vice  governor is that the former opposition had presented similar, or  maybe the same, reasons approximately a year ago, when the  government proposed that parliament elect Tkac to the post of  vice governor. According to some deputies from the Movement for  a Democratic Slovakia and the Slovak National Party, some facts  that prevent Tkac from staying on in this post have only  gradually become known. [passage omitted]    [Tosecka] [passage omitted] The results of the public vote  were as follows: 119 deputies voted in favor of Tkac's recall,  one deputy was against it, and six abstained from voting. The  final decision on recalling will be made by the president of the  Slovak Republic.    For the time being, this is all from the parliament, where  there is a lunch break now.</p>

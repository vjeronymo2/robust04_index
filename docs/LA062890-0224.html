			<p><P> June 28, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> The Italian basketball team Il Messaggero "temporarily" dropped its tampering  suit against the Boston Celtics, but said it has "not weakened in our resolve"  to keep guard Brian Shaw from returning to the NBA club next season.  </P> <P> The announcement came one day after a federal judge in Boston upheld a  five-year, $6.2-million contract that Shaw signed with the Celtics in January  during the first season of his two-year contract with Il Messaggero.  </P> <P> The Italian team's suit claimed the Celtics acted illegally by signing Shaw to  a multiyear deal before his contract with Il Messaggero expired.  </P> <P> "The judge's ruling in no way alters the fact that we have a valid contract  with Brian Shaw that predates that of the Celtics," Il Messaggero's American  attorney John McGovern said. "More important, Brian Shaw wants to fulfill his  contract with Il Messaggero and we want him back next season."  </P></p>

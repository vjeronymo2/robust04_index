			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ligia Moreno and Aneris Gonzalez from "The News" </F> newscast]    [Text] [Moreno] The economic cabinet of President Rafael  Caldera today announced the general strategy or guidelines of  the economic plan to be implemented over the next five years.  One of the highlights is that Venezuelan Petroleum will give 10  percent of its shares to its employees. Other major points  include an emphasis on decentralization and private investments.  Various sectors support the plan and think President Caldera is  on the right track. Time will tell, however, and we have to wait  and see how the economic plan proposed by the Caldera cabinet  works.    [Gonzalez] It is worth mentioning that a large number of  people from all sectors--namely, CTV [Confederation of  Venezuelan Workers], Consecomercio [National Council of Commerce  and Services], and Fedecamaras [Venezuelan Federation of  Associations and Chambers of Commerce and Industry]--have  gathered here at the Eurobuilding Hotel, as you can see your  screen, to discuss and review the entire economic program. As  you rightly pointed out, Ligia, the opening to private  investment is one of the highlights of this strategy, and, in  some way, it has grabbed the attention of all sectors of society.</p>

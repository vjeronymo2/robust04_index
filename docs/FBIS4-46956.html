			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by KAZAKHSTANSKAYA PRAVDA correspondent Andrey </F> Zhdanov: "How Will the President Respond?"]    [Text] On 20 February of this year, commenting on the next  steps of Nursultan Nazarbayev and the republic Cabinet of  Ministers in the area of economic policy, KAZAKHSTANSKAYA PRAVDA  noted: "One can expect more battles over the January-February  package of economic documents of the executive power--at the  executive level, in the new parliament. The difficulty of the  position of the president and government is that the executive  power has only a month and a half or two months or maybe even  less to prove the correctness of the acts that were adopted. If  during this time there is not at least a minimal, even symbolic  slow-up of inflation and the decline of production, the results  of the discussion in parliament will be unpredictable." "Risk is  a noble but not always an appreciated cause." Today, knowing the  content of the statement of the Supreme Council which was made  public by the Kazakhstan press yesterday, one can say that the  risky steps of the executive power did not produce the expected  results and our prediction, alas, turned out to be right, albeit  with a delay of a month and a half.    The refinement of the wording of a number of places in the  document adopted by the Supreme Council on the evening of 27  May, which contains the agreement that there is no "alternative  to the course toward in-depth reform," the desire to "reach a  compromise and accord among the various political forces," and  the "readiness for constructive dialogue with the president"  does not change the essence. The parliament is unambiguously  assessing the present results of the actions of the Cabinet of  Ministers and leveling against it the serious accusation that  the government is essentially blocking the declared course  toward a market economy. In the opinion of the Supreme Council,  this has led to "economic chaos" and therefore it expressed no  confidence in the socioeconomic and legal policy of the  government.    Near the end of the regular round in the struggle among the  various branches of power, the beginning of which was the  introduction of the national currency and the disbanding of the  councils, the new parliament dealt a painful blow to the  president. Nor was it soothed by the decision finally adopted by  the head of state to distance himself from the Cabinet of  Ministers (the recent separation of the staffs of the government  and the president) or by Nazarbayev's increasing criticism of  members of his team, or by the activation in recent months of  foreign political and foreign economic activity in a desire to  win support from foreign politicians, potential investors, and  international financial institutes.    It would be difficult to hope for any other reaction from a  legislator when there was an eightfold decline of the exchange  rate of the tenge from the time of introduction, the permanent  shutdown of not dozens but hundreds of Kazakhstan productions, a  reduction of the national income since the beginning of this  year as compared to the corresponding period of last 1992 by  almost 40 percent, a 30-percent reduction of industrial  production as compared to last year, and numerous other  frightening economic minuses. And it is difficult to argue with  the legislator who under these conditions has seen the only  possibility of avoiding paralysis of power in dialogue among its  branches and social and political forces in order to create a  national program of reform and form a government capable of  carrying it out.    How will the president respond? He will probably not be  enthusiastic about the Supreme Council's intentions to  concentrate their attention on consideration of presidential  edicts adopted in the absence of a legislative organ and, in the  opinion of experts, containing a good number of contradictions  with existing legislation, as well as on the performance of  oversight functions and international treaties subject to  ratification, and also the parliament's intention to  legislatively limit the executive power in disposing of state  property.    The neutral wording of these points of the parliament's  statement should not deceive the public either: It is  essentially a question of a comprehensive expert evaluation and  a probable change of approaches to such key areas of reform as  privatization, economic integration into the world community,  and the role of the state with respect to the commodity producer  with all forms of property. And here it will probably be  impossible to avoid significant compromises.    ...Regardless of how effective the knock-down in the boxing  ring may have looked, when summing up the results of the fight  the judges count it as only one well-aimed blow, one point.  Politics and economics are not boxing. Politics and economics  for the authorities are more like an endless chess match. For  society it would be preferable to have them moderated and  stationary in nature. Now all the participants are in the end  game. The legislator has made his move. In the end game you  cannot be slow, and the president knows this.    Being superstitious about predictions, we shall refrain from  them, especially rash ones.</p>

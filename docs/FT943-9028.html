			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Rally in bond prices lifts US stocks Wall Street A rally in bond prices, in the wake of encouraging inflation news, helped the US stock market yesterday to end a difficult week on an upbeat note, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 17.81 at 3,768.71. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 also ended firmer, up 3.07 at 461.95, while the American Stock Exchange composite finished up 0.45 at 443.70 and the Nasdaq composite 3.41 higher at 731.61. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 251m shares. After bond and stock prices had fallen on Thursday, following disturbing producer prices and retail sales data which raised expectations that the Federal Reserve would put up interest rates again soon, the situation was partially reversed yesterday. Good news on inflation - the consumer prices index rose by only 0.3 per cent in July, a smaller increase than analysts had been expecting - lifted bonds and stocks because it soothed fears of an imminent interest rate increase. Although analysts warned that monetary policy would probably still be tightened by the Fed some time in the near future, the CPI figure was a welcome boost to short-term sentiment after a difficult week in which long-term bond yields had risen steadily. Yesterday, however, bond yields fell, with the benchmark 30-year issue advancing three quarters of point, which pushed its yield down to 7.485 per cent - the first time it had been below 7.5 per cent in a week. Share prices responded immediately to the encouraging move in bond yields, with blue-chip stocks rising steadily from the opening bell. Secondary markets also fared well, although leading shares on the American Stock Exchange struggled to keep up. Among individual stocks, Exxon jumped Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 60 1/4 in volume of 2.2m shares as investors celebrated Thursday's decision by a jury that the oil group was liable for only Dollars 287m in compensatory damages for the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska in March, 1989. The total award was significantly lower than the Dollars 895m asked for by the plaintiffs. Eli Lilly climbed Dollars 2 to Dollars 54 3/4 amid mounting speculation that Glaxo will buy part of PCS - the US group's managed healthcare subsidiary, which was acquired from McKesson earlier this year in a Dollars 4bn transaction. The reports, however, were later denied by the companies, and Eli Lilly shares dropped back sharply to end Dollars 1/4 lower at Dollars 52 1/2 . United American Healthcare rose Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 18 7/8 after a national newspaper reported analysts' predictions of strong growth for the stock in the coming year. Leading bank stocks rebounded from recent declines because of interest rate fears. Bankers Trust rose Dollars 2 to Dollars 69 and Citicorp added Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 42 1/2 . Canada Toronto stocks ended the day with a negative bias as low gold and oil prices prevented equities from joining the rally in US markets. 'If it hadn't been for a strong day with bonds we would have had another bad day,' said Katherine Beattie, economist at MMS International. The TSE 300 ended 0.46 higher at 4,175.14 in volume of 46.99m shares. Declining issues outpaced gainers 364 to 350 with 323 issues unchanged. Mexico Mexican stocks closed up more than 1.5 per cent, buoyed by demand for Telefonos de Mexico (Telmex), the national telephone monopoly. The IPC index closed up 40.87 points at 2,637.63 in moderate volume of 118.5m shares.</p>

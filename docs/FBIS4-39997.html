			<p>BFN     [Text] President Leonid Kravchuk said in the western city  of Lvov that did not know what the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet's  Presidium or parliamentary groups thought about the candidates  for premiership.    He emphasized the need to have the nominations thoroughly  discussed and a final choice made.    Sources close to the leadership of the Ukrainian parliament  said that the presidium had decided to ask Vitaly Masol to  present his program.    He was nominated for premiership by Kravchuk. Prime minister  before 1992, Masol was pensioned off.    Kravchuk said in Lvov he would explain his platform in a  national radio address late on 13 June, nearly two weeks before  the presidential elections.</p>

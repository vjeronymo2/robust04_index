			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: S&amp;N Scottish &amp; Newcastle would have had to produce scintillating interim figures to maintain the recent strong momentum of its shares. In the event, profits were merely in line with expectations and the company's reluctance to give detailed breakdowns of its businesses again did little to help its case. So yesterday's 2.6 per cent fall in the shares should not be seen as a reconsideration of its Chef &amp; Brewer purchase. It will be another six months at least before hard evidence emerges of the degree to which Scottish has been able to exploit that particular opportunity. The latest omens are mixed. Volume sales of some brands, notably Theakston's, held up well. Own label production fell sharply, albeit from a tiny base. That changes the mix of output, though, and the smaller component of low-margin business suggests the underlying margin pressure on branded products was greater than meets the eye. Scottish admits to tough conditions in the important off-trade. In leisure, there is a hint that the continental recession is affecting Center Parcs. Occupancy is good but customers show a reluctance to spend on site. Indeed retailing is the one activity where margins are improving. In theory that bodes well for Chef &amp; Brewer, which increases the emphasis on the lucrative food sector. Much depends on whether the Pounds 11m refurbishment promised in the second half turns out to be sufficient, and whether capital expenditure elsewhere - such as the development of new Center Parcs - has to be restrained to make way for more spending on the retail estate. Scottish has come late to food retailing. Others such as Whitbread have a track record. On a historic multiple of over 16 compared with Whitbread's 13.5, Scottish has a lot to prove.</p>

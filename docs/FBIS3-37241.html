			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Yuriy Aleksandrov report in the "In Brief" column] </F>   [Text] Kiev -- Ukraine's nuclear power industry is on the  verge of stopping. Nuclear fuel stocks at nuclear power plants  are running out while fresh supplies from Russia have been  stopped as of the beginning of this year. The TVEL concern,  Russia's sole producer of nuclear power fuel, cites the ban by  the State Committee for Supervision over the Safety of Work in  Industry and Atomic Power Engineering [Gosatomnadzor]. The  latter for its part points to the expiration at the end of last  year of a corresponding interstate Russian-Ukrainian agreement.  The problem has grown from purely economic into a political  one.    The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has informed its  Ukrainian colleagues that deliveries of nuclear fuel may be  resumed only if Ukraine accedes to the nuclear nonproliferation  treaty. The Kiev leadership has asked Chernomyrdin to lift  restrictions on nuclear fuel deliveries from Russia. It is  hardly accidental that the conflict has flared up during the  Russian-Ukrainian negotiations on Ukraine's nuclear disarmament  in Kiev. It seems that the Russian side decided to play a trump  which can effectively shut down Ukraine's nuclear power industry.</p>

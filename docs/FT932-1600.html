			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Tebbit warns on Maastricht bill LORD Tebbit, the former Conservative cabinet minister and party chairman, aligned himself with Mr Tony Benn,MP for Chesterfield and champion of Labour's left wing, in opposing the Maastricht bill in the House of Lords last night. He also ruffled ministerial feathers by challenging an agreement between government and opposition leaders on the time to be devoted to a debate on a common European defence policy. Baroness Thatcher, the former prime minister, opted for a non-speaking role as Lord Tebbit initially took the lead in attacking the bill from the government back benches. He stressed that he was at one with Mr Benn in resisting the federalist tendencies of the European Community so as to ensure that basic decisions affecting the British people were taken at Westminster and not Brussels. Lord Tebbit then upset ministers by making an unsuccessful attempt to prolong the discussion on a common defence policy on the grounds that Baroness Chalker, foreign office minister, had failed to deal with all the issues in making what was intended to be the final speech. With no guillotine available to the government in the Lords arrangements for an informal timetable assume special significance, particularly at the start of a marathon committee stage - 430 amendments are already down for discussion and more are expected. Lady Chalker commented 'I do not think anything I say in this debate will ever satisfy Lord Tebbit'. In the first voting challenge - on an amendment moved by Lord Jay (Lab) seeking to overturn the provision in the treaty imposing European citizenship on British nationals - the government secured a majority of 194 (242-48). Lord Tebbit forecast that, in spite of ministerial assurances that European citizenship would confer new rights and no new responsibilities, British nationals were likely to be subject to new demands, possibly including conscription to the armed forces,as federalism gained momentum in the years ahead.</p>

			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / International Company News: Buyers look over First City Bancorporation FIRST CITY Bancorporation, the troubled Texas bank which has been seeking a buyer for months, said yesterday that several potential buyers were looking over its books. It also gave details of a plan for structuring any takeover and recapitalisation in a way which, it claimed, should mean no loss for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the government agency which oversees the restructuring of troubled banks. The FDIC provided nearly Dollars 1bn of a Dollars 1.5bn rescue package for First City in 1987 and is anxious to avoid a second large cash injection in such a short time. First City Bancorporation is one of the largest remaining independent banks in Texas under local ownership. Mr Robert Abboud, the Chicago banker who led the 1987 bail-out, resigned as chairman a year ago in the face of mounting loan losses. The bank said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it expected an operating loss in the first quarter and losses were expected to continue until a deal was struck which restored its capital adequacy. Without such a deal, the management believed that 'substantial doubt exists as to the ability of First City to continue as a going concern'. The proposed deal would involve First City's non-performing and doubtful loans being put into a separate pool, managed by the buyer. The buyer would also have the senior interest in the pool, which would be partially guaranteed by the FDIC. The agency would receive a fee in the form of an interest in the pool. First City's shareholders would get a residual interest in the pool in exchange for their shares. At the end of last year, some Dollars 670m of the bank's Dollars 5.5bn loan portfolio was non-performing.</p>

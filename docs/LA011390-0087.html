			<p><P> January 13, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY;  </P> <P> CHARGES AGAINST ONE DEPUTY DROPPED IN CIVIL RIGHTS CASE  </P> <P> Civil rights abuse charges were dismissed Friday against one of six San  Bernardino County Sheriff's deputies accused of brutality in the alleged  beatings of five Mexican nationals in 1988. U.S. District Judge A. Wallace  Tashima removed Deputy Michael Stout at the request of the lawyer for the  deputies. Attorney Stephen Yagman, who represents the five plaintiffs, said the  civil rights allegations against Stout were dismissed because the officer  played only a minor role in the alleged beatings on June 30, 1988, in  Victorville.  </P> <P> "He got to the scene late," Yagman said. "He was also the nicest one on the  (witness) stand." The alleged beatings occurred when deputies arrived to  investigate a complaint about a loud, all-night party. A neighbor's videotape  of the arrests, showing the alleged beatings, has become the trial's  centerpiece.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 15, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> BO JACKSON DON'T KNOW DIDDLY  </P> <P> Rock legend Bo Diddley said his counterpart in two television commercials,  sports star Bo Jackson, really doesn't know diddly about playing the guitar.  </P> <P> "It's just like you see in the movies.  </P> <P> The guitar player who was with us was almost like a stunt man," Diddley said.  "It just looks like he's playing that guitar, just like it looks like I'm  shooting pool. They had me shooting pool, but I can't shoot pool."  </P> <P> The first Nike ad, initially aired during the 1989 baseball All-Star Game,  showed Jackson playing several sports and a superstar in each sport saying  things such as, "Bo knows basketball."  </P> <P> Then, on a stage with Diddley and his famous box-shaped guitar, Jackson tried  to play a guitar, but Diddley told him, "Bo, you don't know diddly."  </P> <P> A few months later, Nike came back with a second ad with shots of Jackson and  Diddley in a variety of leisure pursuits. It ends with Jackson supposedly  playing guitar and Diddley saying the athlete does know diddly after all.  </P> <P> Diddley said the second ad gives the impression that time has passed since the  first ad, but both were shot at the same time.  </P> <P> "It's all just show business," he told the Birmingham Post-Herald.  </P></p>

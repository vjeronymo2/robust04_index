			<p>BFN     [Text] A co-chairman of the All-Tatar Public Center (ATPC),  Rashat Safin, told a news conference Thursday that the ATPC  intended to launch a new stage of its struggle for the national  liberation of the Tatar people and sovereignty of the Republic,  following changes in the political situation inside Tatarstan  such as the signing of a power-sharing treaty with Russia and  the recent elections to the National Assembly.    The ATPC believes that the treaty runs counter to the Tatar  Constitution, while the 13 March elections showed numerous  violations of democratic principles and human rights. Under  such circumstances, the ATPC will become a constructive  opposition to join the political struggle for power. Until  recently, the movement concentrated on developing a mechanism  for consolidating the nation and stood aloof from the republic's  internal problems.    According to Safin, Tatarstan took the moral lead in Russian  reform as it struggled for the status of a member of a real  federation. However, the treaty reiterated that Russia was a  unitary state, and many republics had to follow suit, thus  harming Russia as a whole.    Positively assessing the fact that such a treaty was signed,  the movement pointed out that in fact the document secured the  old relations between the center and a raw-material-producing  appendage and did not envision equal rights.    The ATPC demanded that the Tatar Supreme Soviet assign  international status to the treaty and hold parliamentary  hearings on the issue. The movement insisted on the  denunciation of intergovernmental economic agreements which  enslave Tatarstan, according to the ATPC.    The movement said it had no confidence in Tatar President  Mintimer Shaymiyev, Vice President Vasiliy Likhachev, Prime  Minister Mukhammat Sabirov and the whole of government. The  ATPC supported early parliamentary elections and changes in the  personnel policy which was rife with nepotism.</p>

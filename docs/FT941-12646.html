			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (17): A time for caution and locking in - The professionals / The portfolios had a useful 1993, but now our fund managers are more circumspect This feature is an allocation exercise, to see how four fund managers handle a Pounds 250,000 portfolio on behalf of a hypothetical client - a wealthy individual or a small self-administered pension fund. The managers emphasise that they are investing for the long term (10 years or more) rather than for short-term gain. The exercise started at the beginning of October 1990. The portfolios given here were drawn up at the beginning of this month, and will be reviewed at the end of March. The fourth quarter of 1993 was a good one for most equity and bond investors, and our four professional fund managers can look back on healthy profits. As they look ahead, however, they are cautious, and inclined to lock in some of 1993's gains. Paul Myners, of Gartmore, says: 'It is likely that the best selling opportunity will be at some point in the first quarter; nevertheless, I think we will do some trimming now.' He has switched 7.5 per cent of his portfolio into US dollar deposits. A similar approach is taken by Douglas McDougall, of Baillie Gifford: 'We are trimming each of our four areas of investment to raise cash amounting to 10 per cent of the portfolio. The cash will be held in US dollars, to take advantage of expected relative interest rate movements.' Howard Beaufort, of Newton Investment Management, has been the most cautious for some time, and takes a cynical view of the recent strength of stock markets: 'The bulls are currently rampaging in the world's financial markets with as little regard for their eventual fate as their animal confreres who run the streets of Pamplona in an annual rush to oblivion.' Tim Howe, of Singer &amp; Friedlander, is probably the most optimistic: 'In general, economic conditions continue to favour equity investment, although investors will continue to earn real returns from fixed-interest investments and cash.' Nevertheless, he too is cashing in some of his gains. 'A number of the far-eastern markets now look overheated following their dramatic outperformance.' The portfolios still show a strong equity bias, however, with the proportion varying from 75 to 85 per cent: The biggest change by Howard Beaufort during the quarter was to sell the portfolio's holding in US Treasuries when the long bond yield dipped below 5.9 per cent. Nevertheless, 'with inflation remaining firmly under control throughout most of the developed world, and with interest rates, outside the US, still on a firmly downward trend, we retain our bullish stance towards quality bond and fixed-interest investment. The UK gilt market, in particular, seems well placed to consolidate its 1993 advance.' 'New UK equity investment at current levels is taking a great deal on trust, and must be virtually restricted to really solid growth companies. European stock markets have been driven up by well over 25 per cent on average in 1993, largely on the back of US investors seeking overseas outlets for their funds and believing that interest rates will fall far and fast enough to justify the current heady ratings. Such implicit faith in European economic recovery next year may well prove misguided. 'The US stock market has been dominated by continuing evidence that the pace of growth has picked up. Having risen by just 8 per cent in 1993, the US equity market may be more firmly rooted in reality than most. In Tokyo, we believe that prolongation of the recession, and the realisation that the climb back is going to be very long and very slow, will tend to keep investors on the sidelines in the immediate term.' Douglas McDougall was to switch his holdings of long US government bonds into long UK gilts. 'This was a profitable move, as US government bonds have since shown a negative return' he points out. 'The portfolio also benefited from our concentration in UK and south-east Asian equities, our absence from the US and Japanese markets and our big holdings of long gilts.' 'Stock market valuations, especially in terms of yield, are now expensive by historical standards in all major areas. The rise in equities over the past year or so has been driven by falling interest rates, and in particular by the low, or even negative, real short-term rates of interest in the US. Short rates in the US look likely to rise before long, while bond yields in the US have now risen by around 10 per cent from their lows, and bond yields in the UK and Europe are unlikely to have a great deal further to fall.' 'Both the asset allocation moves we made last time added value', says Paul Myners. 'We switched money from gilts into European equities, and from US bonds into cash. All in all, the UK looks well placed among world stock markets. While we are moving to a more defensive posture, the UK would not be at the front of the queue to take profits. 'The US economy is beginning to pleasantly surprise, and we believe this will continue. Unfortunately this is far from positive for equities, as it is likely to lead to a rise in interest rates. 'While we are not predicting a major bear phase, it seems probable that a rise in rates could trigger a 10 to 15 per cent correction in the US. Any monetary tightening will affect the rest of the world, given the accelerating flow of US capital into international equities. All markets have benefited from this in 1993 and all will suffer if it reverses. 'European markets are looking particularly vulnerable, given the weakness of their underlying economies. Their stock markets have taken heart this year from the long-expected cut in interest rates. Unfortunately rates have not been cut swiftly enough to save the economies, and no worthwhile recovery will now be seen until 1995. This leaves some scope for disappointment on corporate profits in the shorter term. 'Asia (ex Japan) continues to offer the best economic prospects. However, the markets increasingly reflect this and some profit-taking is probably in order.' Tim Howe says: 'It appears that the bull market in bonds is almost over. Although there remains scope for significant interest rate cuts in continental Europe, any capital gain in European bonds is likely to be negated by capital weakness against sterling. We have therefore sold our holding of European bonds and reinvested the proceeds in long dated UK index-linked stock. 'In the UK market, it is likely that small to medium capitalisation stocks will outperform their larger FT-SE 100 brethren. While retaining our overall weighting in the UK market, we are tempted selectively to take profits from our holdings in larger companies, and reinvest in smaller groups. 'The US market continues to look relatively expensive.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                   HOW THEY ALLOCATE THEIR ASSETS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Douglas McDougal BG  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                    per cent UK equities             42 Europe equities         13 SE Asia equities        20 Long UK Govt. bonds     15 Cash (dollars)          10  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- LAST TIME:  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- UK equities (45 per cent), Europe equities (15), SE Asia equities (22.5), Long UK Govt. bonds (1.5)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Paul Myners Gartmore  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                    per cent UK Equities             50 Pacific Rim equities    15 US Equities*           7.5 European equities      7.5 Mexican equities         5 Cash (dollars)          15  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- LAST TIME:  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- UK equities (50 per cent), Pacific Rim equities (17.5), US equities* (10), European equities (10), Mexican equities (5), Cash (dollars) 7.5  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- * now in smaller companies  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Howard Beaufort Newton  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                    per cent UK equities             50 US equities              6 Far east equities       12 Swiss equities           8 Swedish equities         3 Netherlands equities     4 Netherlands bonds        2 Japanese bonds           3 UK gilts                10 Cash                     2  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- LAST TIME:  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- UK equities (48 per cent), US equities (6), Far east equities (8), Swiss equities (9), Swedish equities (4), Neth. equities (4), US bonds (4), Neth. bonds (3), Cash pounds (1), UK gilts (9), Japanese bonds(4)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Tim Howe SF  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                    per cent UK equities             60 European equities        7 US equities              4 Japanese equities        4 Other Far East           4 Australia/Mexico         4 Index-linked Gilts      10 Cash (pounds)            7  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- LAST TIME:  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- UK equities (60 per cent), European equities (7), US equities (4), Australian equities (2), Japan &amp; Other Far East (7), European bonds (10), Cash pounds (10)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

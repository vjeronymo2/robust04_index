			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Dutch sell stake in IWP PLA, the Dutch holding company, has sold half of its 6m shareholding in IWP, the Irish industrial holding company, in a deal estimated to be worth some IPounds 12m (Pounds 11.5m). The shares were acquired by PLA in November last year as part of a complex IPounds 51m acquisition by IWP of Levendaal Beheer, a PLA subsidiary, in which PLA subscribed for 6m new ordinary shares in IWP at 308p each. It is understood that yesterday's sale of the shares to Dillon Reed Securities of the US, was at about 390p per share. Dillon has placed the shares with other institutions. The terms of the original acquisition were that any sale of the new shares by PLA would require the prior consent of IWP. In a statement yesterday, IWP said it has agreed to the sale of half of the 6m holding, and that the company welcomed the broadening of its shareholder base.</p>

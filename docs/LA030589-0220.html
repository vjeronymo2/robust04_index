			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DELAYS IN FINDING OPEN FACILITY FRUSTRATE PARAMEDICS, PUBLIC  </P> <P> Call 911 and in a few minutes chances are that paramedics will be on the scene  to treat the patient and load him into an ambulance.  </P> <P> But often these days, instead of speeding off, the ambulance just sits there,  while friends and relatives of the victim grow impatient as frustrated  paramedics wait for word on where to transport the victim.  </P> <P> John Wilson, general manager of Crippen Ambulance Service in Covina, said the  wait can stretch from five to 20 minutes. And even after an ambulance is on the  way to a hospital, he said, it is not uncommon to be rerouted, meaning that  family members, and perhaps the family doctor, are going to one hospital while  the patient heads for another.  </P> <P> Wilson said such breakdowns in the emergency-care system are "causing a lot of  grief."  </P> <P> Patrick McAlmond, regional manager of Cole-Schaefer Ambulance Service in  Pomona, said that in one case paramedics took a patient to three hospitals  before finding one that would grant admittance.  </P> <P> "Originally, the patient wasn't in bad shape," McAlmond said, but by the end of  the ordeal, the condition had turned critical. While such an extreme example is  rare, he said, there is no doubt that "the whole system is in a crunch."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 35-Minute Wait  </P> <P> In a more typical case, a county Fire Department paramedic squad in South El  Monte responded to an accident on the Pomona Freeway Thursday that involved six  victims. The paramedics said they loaded the victims, none of whom were  seriously injured, into ambulances and then sat on the freeway for 35 minutes  waiting for direction.  </P> <P> Each paramedic unit in the county is assigned to work with a base station  hospital, which directs patient treatment by radio or telephone and tells the  paramedics where to take their patients. Six hospitals in the San Gabriel  Valley have been designated as base stations.  </P> <P> If the nearest emergency room refuses to take the patient, the ambulance must  wait while the base hospital searches for an alternative that is no more than  10 minutes away, or in the case of a trauma center, within 20 minutes. If all  the facilities contacted are closed, paramedics are instructed to take the  patient to the nearest emergency room anyway.  </P> <P> Eileen Rice, pre-hospital care coordinator at Methodist Hospital of Southern  California in Arcadia, which is a paramedic base station, said there is no way  of knowing in advance when a hospital will be too busy to handle another  emergency, and so paramedics must await instructions on each run. "A lot of  time," she said, "the wait seems longer than it is."  </P> <P> County paramedic Bob Cormack said he was at the scene of an accident about six  months ago on the 605 Freeway, near the Pomona Freeway, that involved 12  victims. One of the victims, he said, was showing worrisome symptoms, and "I  wanted to get her (to the hospital) as quickly as possible." But the accident  was 100 feet outside the service area of a trauma center, he said, and it took  45 minutes for his base hospital to persuade the trauma center to take the  case.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Priority Patients  </P> <P> Cormack said critically ill or injured patients receive priority and there is  no delay in getting them to a hospital. He said the delays are occurring for  patients who seem to have less serious injuries.  </P> <P> But one of the problems, he said, is that paramedics cannot assess everyone's  condition with certainty. "We have good training and all," he said, "but we  can't tell if someone is bleeding a lot inside."  </P> <P> Virginia Price-Hastings, director of the county's paramedic and trauma hospital  program, said she has heard so many reports about paramedics "standing around"  at emergency scenes that such complaints "are probably valid."  </P> <P> Part of the problem, she said, is the sheer volume of emergency calls.  Paramedics countywide responded to 425,000 calls last year.  </P> <P> Not only is the volume huge, but the calls tend to come in bunches, with more  Thursday through Sunday than Monday through Wednesday, Price-Hastings said.  Also, there is always a spurt in January and early February for reasons that  are not entirely clear. "Some people attribute it to the flu season," she said.  "Others say people are opening bills after Christmas and having heart attacks."  </P> <P> Price-Hastings said hospitals are allowed to turn away ambulances with  paramedics aboard because paramedics "have the ability to manage the patient."  But hospitals cannot turn away emergency cases in which patients arrive at the  hospital under their own power or in an ambulance without paramedics on board.  </P> <P> Cormack, who works on a paramedic squad based in South El Monte, said that  because local emergency rooms are closed so frequently, emergency runs that  took an hour two years ago are now taking an hour and a half or more.  </P> <P> "Patient care is really getting compromised," he said. "We do everything we can  in the back of an ambulance . . . but there is only so much you can do back  there. They've got a lot better equipment at the hospital, and they're a lot  more trained than we are."  </P> <P> In some cities, such as Pasadena, paramedics transport patients to the hospital  in city ambulances. In other cities, such as those served by paramedics from  the county Fire Department, patients are transported by private ambulance, with  paramedics going along to the hospital only when necessary.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Refusing Care  </P> <P> Cormack said that because paramedics often cannot take patients to their  preferred hospital, people increasingly are refusing care and saying they will  get to the hospital on their own.  </P> <P> One ambulance company executive said he has heard of a case in which paramedics  bailed out of an ambulance just before it reached a hospital so that the  hospital would have to take the patient. A paramedic who works for a private  ambulance company said he once heard a colleague advise a man who had  complained of chest pains to have his wife drive him to the nearest emergency  room and save himself an ambulance ride to a hospital farther away.  </P> <P> McAlmond of Cole-Schaefer Ambulance Service and Rice of Methodist Hospital  scoffed at those stories. "That would be tantamount to abandoning a patient,"  Rice said, adding that no paramedic would be foolish enough to risk the legal  liability of leaving a patient on his own. McAlmond put it more simply: "If one  of my paramedics did that, I'd kill him."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Dial 911'  </P> <P> County Fire Capt. Eugene McCarthy, a paramedic coordinator, said some of the  heavy load on paramedic services is coming from people who do not have the  money or insurance to pay for care. "When the state cuts funding for health  clinics," McCarthy said, "where do these people go? They dial 911."  </P> <P> McCarthy estimated that 60% to 70% of the emergency calls that are answered by  paramedic units do not require paramedic skills. He said eventually the county  may have to adopt a system of having dispatchers decide whether a 911 call  requires paramedics or could be handled by lesser-trained emergency medical  technicians. He noted that Los Angeles and other cities are beginning to  establish such priority systems.  </P> <P> The county Fire Department has 40 paramedic squads, including 10 scattered  through the San Gabriel Valley. In addition, eight engine companies have a  single paramedic on duty who can assess a patient's condition and undertake  some life-saving procedures until a two-member paramedic squad arrives.  </P> <P> McCarthy said the number of paramedic squads has not increased for at least  five years.  </P> <P> The county system is designed to get paramedics to the scene in eight to 10  minutes, but in Claremont, city officials say the response time is often much  longer than that, and they are seeking permission to have a private ambulance  company provide paramedic service.  </P> <P> Daniel G. Gold, president of Medic-1, said his company has offered to provide  paramedics to Claremont without cost, and he believes that he can do so at a  profit, charging customers for the service.  </P> <P> But ambulance companies that provide paramedic services to Pomona and El Monte  under a similar arrangement say they are losing money on the service.  </P> <P> Joe Dolphin, who owns Medevac Inc. in El Monte, said his company reduced the  number of paramedic units on duty at any one time in El Monte from two to one  two years ago because revenue was not covering expenses. "It was draining the  company," he said.  </P> <P> Dolphin said the business is unprofitable because so many patients fail to pay  their bills. The county pays $3 million a year to ambulance companies to help  pay for indigent patients, but Dolphin said the amount is not enough to cover  the costs.  </P> <P> In Pomona, McAlmond said Cole-Schaefer loses money on the paramedic service  because only 53% of the patients pay their bills. Dolphin said the collection  rate is even lower in El Monte.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fund-Raising Drive  </P> <P> El Monte Fire Chief Leslie E. George said the city cannot afford to establish  its own paramedic squad or pay Medevac or the county to provide supplemental  service. As an alternative, George has embarked on a fund-raising effort to  acquire defibrillators for each of the city's fire trucks so that firefighters  will be equipped to treat cardiac arrests.  </P> <P> The county Fire Department also has begun equipping all of its fire stations  with defibrillators.  </P> <P> Capt. McCarthy said that unless the funding problems are resolved so that  hospital emergency rooms are open when needed, the strain on paramedic services  will continue.  </P> <P> "The paramedic system is just as fragile as the hospital system," he said.  "When they collapse, we collapse."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Love What They Do'  </P> <P> "There isn't a paramedic that I ever met who doesn't want to give good service,  who doesn't want to get there as fast as he can," McCarthy said. "They love  what they do. This job means everything to them." And so, he said, it is  particularly frustrating to paramedics when they find themselves out in the  field at the scene of emergency waiting for direction.  </P> <P> County paramedic Jeff Kaliher, who is based in South El Monte, said he  responded recently to an emergency call from a woman who had abdominal pain.  The woman's boyfriend became irate, Kaliher said, because "we couldn't go  anywhere until we found out what hospital was open. The man was screaming at  us, 'Do something! You guys aren't doing anything!' "  </P> <P> Kaliher said that whenever there is a delay of that sort, "We try to explain  (the problem) to them, but they don't understand."  </P> <P> 24-HOUR HOSPITALS SERVING THE SAN GABRIEL VALLEY  </P> <P> 1 -- Alhambra Community Hospital  </P> <P> 100 S.

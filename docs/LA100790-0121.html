			<p><P> October 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEDICINAL PURPOSES;  </P> <P> HEALTH AND HAPPINESS BY DIANE JOHNSON (ALFRED A. KNOPF: $19.95; 255 PP.;  0-394-58717-0)  </P> <P> Whatsoever house I enter, there I will go for the benefit of the sick,  refraining from all wrongdoing or corruption, and especially from any act of  seduction of male or female, of bond or free.  </P> <P> So reads the Hippocratic oath, written in the 4th Century BC as a code of  behavior for physicians. But 24 centuries is a long, long time. These days, the  relationship between a male doctor and his female patient has become an erotic  time bomb, ticking away in the territory between professional ethics and the  inevitable interactions between a man wearing the white coat of authority and a  naked woman in need.  </P> <P> Diane Johnson, an experienced writer whose readable, sparkling prose is  combined with an intense moral seriousness, has taken on the exploration of  this territory in her novel "Health and Happiness." Johnson is a master  storyteller, and the issues that the book addresses, issues arising out of a  situation in which individual men have the power of life and death over other  men -- and women -- are gracefully manifested in characters who intersect with  each other's lives in a fascinating and satisfying narrative.  </P> <P> The book's heroine is Ivy Tarro, the nursing single-mother of an infant  daughter. Ivy lives in a spare San Francisco apartment with a great view, and  works in a trendy restaurant. Her swollen arm, which turns out to be nothing  more than a clogged mammary gland, is misdiagnosed by her own doctor and then  by Dr. Bradford Evans of Alta Buena Hospital as a serious axillary vein  thrombosis. Because of the misdiagnosis, she is treated with the wrong drug,  and when she reacts badly she is given more of it.  </P> <P> During the three weeks Ivy spends in the hospital, while she sickens, almost  dies and recovers, the life of the hospital becomes more real to her than her  real life. There she meets Mimi Franklin, the good-hearted paid volunteer whose  serenity has been shattered because the hospital wants to buy her house in  order to tear it down and expand parking facilities. Mimi has had a disastrous  affair with Dr. Evans, and like many women at the hospital, she has a crush on  the handsome, powerful Dr. Philip Watts, who is as famous for his perfect  marriage to a blond heiress named Jennifer as he is for his grace under  pressure. "It would be easy enough to think herself a little in love with  Philip Watts," Mimi muses. "Such a bundle of manly qualities!"  </P> <P> But Philip Watts, the man who has his life and his career completely and  satisfyingly under control, is not destined to have a comfortable affair with  Mimi Franklin. He is destined to fall hopelessly, totally in love with the  flaky, irrational Ivy Tarro, a woman whose head never has a chance against her  heart. "She was a young red-headed woman of exceptional beauty," Dr. Philip  Watts notes in his last dispassionate observation of Ivy. "This he noticed in  spite of himself -- the cloud of red hair, the camellia-like pallor. From this  distance he could not see the condition of her arm. But her beauty claimed his  notice as a loud noise might, like someone dropping a bottle behind you, or a  truck backfiring, the sound impinging on the consciousness of an unwilling man  who was thinking about something else."  </P> <P> As Johnson's narrative seamlessly shifts from Philip's point of view to Ivy's  and Mimi's and back again, each of their lives is changed. First the  imperturbable Philip Watts finds himself blowing up at another doctor about the  way he's dressed. The change climaxes when Watts, always a stickler for  protocol, finds himself storming into the operating theater to rescue Ivy from  the surgeons' knives. In doing so, he almost hits the surgeon.  </P> <P> For a conventional doctor, this kind of intervention with colleagues is a  violation of all hospital procedures. But Philip Watts is no longer a  conventional doctor, he is a man in love. As he looks down at Ivy Tarro, he  changes. "Her face, even with the calm of anesthesia, bore traces of anguish.  He thought he could discern a tear stain, a dampness at the hairline where her  head was wrapped in a bandage of sterile cloth. He was moved in a way that he  was at a loss to put a name to. Relief and success were surely part of it -- he  had frustrated the surgeons and rescued the young woman. . . . He had a strong  impulse to pick her up and carry her in his arms to safety, like a fireman."  </P> <P> Each character in the book is perfectly drawn, from the ditzy Jennifer, who  agonizes about the morality of eating shellfish because it may have a high pain  threshold, to the threatening bureaucrat from Alta Buena who tries to bully  Mimi into selling her house, to the malicious Chinese exchange student. Johnson  gets the way doctors treat each other -- their rivalries, comradeships and  indecipherable language -- just right: "Dr. Evans made the diagnosis of a blood  clot of unknown origin obstructing the subclavian vein, and this was  substantiated by a venogram," one doctor explains to another.  </P> <P> Ivy herself is an enchanting and sensitive character. She wakes up from her  fever one night with the sense that someone is hiding in the room she shares  with another patient. "Death in the room. Ivy could feel his gaze on her too,"  she thinks in a panic. "A choking sensation in her throat became so intense  that she was obliged to struggle to sit up a little. She opened her eyes. She  stared at the hem of the dividing curtain, expecting death's shoes and pantlegs  to be visible as he quietly stood over her friend in the other bed."  </P> <P> This is not a novel about death but about life, and about the sneaky way that  love and life conspire to triumph over death, even in a hospital, even with  doctors and their patients.  </P></p>

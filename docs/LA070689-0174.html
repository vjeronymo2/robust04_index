			<p><P> July 6, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> KEMP CITES ABUSES, HALTS ELDERLY HOUSING PROGRAM  </P> <P> HUD Secretary Jack Kemp today suspended a housing program for the elderly that  has cost the government more than $119 million in losses, as he struggled to  clean up mismanagement and abuse within the agency dating from the Ronald  Reagan Administration.  </P> <P> Kemp announced he was halting new and pending applications for the Retirement  Service Center program, saying that in addition to costing the government  millions it has failed to serve the low-income elderly for whom it was  designed.  </P> <P> It was the third troubled program Kemp has placed on hold since taking over the  reins of the Department of Housing and Urban Development earlier this year.  </P> <P> In announcing the latest suspension, Kemp said that in addition to direct  losses, the program has incurred loan defaults in excess of $250 million.  </P> <P> "This is a program that should serve low-income people but instead is serving  upper- and middle-income persons -- and doing it very poorly at that," he said.  "I plan a complete redesign of the Retirement Service Center program and will  require that it be targeted to low- and moderate-income elderly."  </P> <P> About 30% of the projects that received HUD funding since the program was  launched in 1983 are in default, the department said. Many were built in areas  where there was not a sufficient shortage in housing for the elderly to support  the projects, officials added.  </P></p>

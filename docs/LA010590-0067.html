			<p><P> January 5, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SACRAMENTO;  </P> <P> MARINES ORDERED TO REMOVE TOXIC WASTE  </P> <P> A state water quality agency has ordered officials at the U.S. Marine Corps  Logistics Base near Barstow to clean up a military landfill where barrels of  hazardous sandblasting waste are buried. Base spokesmen acknowledge that  55-gallon drums of the waste routinely were dumped at the landfill, perhaps as  early as 1961.  </P> <P> But the Marines say they did not know the material contained dangerous levels  of lead and other heavy metals, thus requiring its disposal at a hazardous  waste landfill. The order issued by the California Regional Water Quality  Control Board calls the waste a threat to the area's aquifer, the sole drinking  water source for several desert communities. It requires base officials to  complete the clean-up by March, 1991, or face legal action.  </P></p>

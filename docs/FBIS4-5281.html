			<p>BFN     [Text] A Japanese Government source said on 6 April:  "North Korea is not expected to arm itself with nuclear  weapons, but in framing Japanese defense policy, the government  must take into account the possibility that Pyongyang could arm  itself with nuclear weapons."    His comments came in response to North Korea's suspected  nuclear weapons development, an issue that heightened tensions  on the Korean peninsula after Pyongyang refused to allow  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors to check  nuclear sites.    His remarks indicated that the government should take into  account the situation in North Korea in its continuing review of  the Guidelines for Defense Build-Up.    On the need to defuse tensions on the Korean peninsula, the  government source stressed the need to think of ways which would  lead North Korea to act moderately.    He said: "North Korea is currently in a state of starvation  and Chinese food aid is needed."</p>

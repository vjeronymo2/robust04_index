			<p>920727 FT  27 JUL 92 / Japanese spurn 'ox-walking opposition': The failure to take advantage of mishaps within the ruling party WHEN Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, last night painted in the eye of a traditional daruma doll to celebrate the ruling Liberal Democratic party's electoral successes, the country's opposition parties' leaders pointed to a record low turnout as evidence of disillusionment with the LDP. But the turnout was more a measure of popular disgust with the opposition parties and, in particular, the Social Democratic party (SDPJ), which was called the Socialist party when it scored a remarkable victory in the 1989 upper House election. Last night, Miss Takako Doi, the party's leader during that triumphant campaign, insisted that the country 'must not forget the hundreds of thousands who died in the (second world) war'. Her statement was a defence of the party's decision to focus its campaign on the use of Japanese military personnel for international peace-keeping organisations, and to ignore most other issues. However, Miss Doi, replaced as party leader last year, is herself a symbol of the inability of the SDPJ to make itself a genuine alternative to the LDP. During the past three years, the ruling party has been tainted by a succession of scandals and factional farces, and yet popular support for the leading opposition party has crumbled. For many Japanese, the party has become known as the 'ox-walking opposition', a reference to the painfully slow steps taken during the parliamentary vote last month on the peace-keeping legislation. Japanese do harbour doubts about that legislation, but they are also looking for sound economic management and a fair share of the public works pork barrel. The inability of the SDPJ to offer an alternative is rooted in the factional make-up of the party. While the LDP's factions, and the patronage system they encourage, are rightly famous, the SDPJ is also deeply divided and remains under the influence of an ideological left wing more determined to guard the faith than to win an election. 'Seventy per cent of the party is to the right of the left wing', as a senior official put it, but the remaining 30 per cent, including Miss Doi herself, controls many of its policy-making committees. This left-wing faction is almost incoherent on issues such as relations with the US and the status of South Korea - the faction is a firm supporter of North Korea and Kim Il Sung, its authoritarian Great Leader. The SDPJ has been feeble in fashioning economic policy and its present leader, Mr Makoto Tanabe, preferred to attack a 3 per cent value-added tax introduced before the 1989 election than to recommend measures to stimulate the slowing economy. Japanese are beginning to fear that the economy will get much worse before it gets better, yet these concerns were not seriously addressed by Mr Tanabe. The results are a victory for Mr Miyazawa, whose first few months in office were awkward. His faction manager, Mr Fumio Abe, was forced to resign in January when arrested for allegedly accepting bribes, and it was rumoured then that Mr Miyazawa would be replaced before the summer. Among the smaller opposition parties, final results early today confirmed that Komeito (the Clean Government party) can rely on its religious base, the Soka Gakkai movement, to deliver the votes to maintain its minority status. But Rengo, the trade union party, discovered that it cannot rely on its union base to ensure success, as it did not win a seat. One of the parties that was supposed to lead a 'realignment of Japanese politics', Rengo brawled publicly over the peace-keeping legislation with the SDPJ, which had supported that party's candidates at the previous election. Rengo argued in favour of lower taxes and higher pensions, but when Mr Tasaburo Furukawa, the party's secretary-general, was asked before the election about plans for an opposition party alliance, he replied vaguely: 'We have a plan, but we can't discuss it now.' Voters were apparently not impressed. The result leaves the LDP in a strong position to take control of the upper House at the next half-house election in 1995, when the seats won by the surging SDPJ in 1989 will be recontested.</p>

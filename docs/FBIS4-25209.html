			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Willy Wo-lap Lam] </F>   [Text] A plenary session of the Communist Party Central  Committee will be held later this year to discuss ways in which  the central authorities will regulate the embryonic market  economy. The move confirms the recent trend that to reassert  central control and boost social stability, the leadership is  restoring some elements of state planning.    Top on the agenda of the conference, which will be the  Fourth  Plenum of the 14th Central Committee, will be working out  mechanisms to ensure better state control of economic  activities, particularly those of localities.    An economic source said Beijing's goals included ways to  ensure noninflationary growth; to contain fixed-asset  investments by local governments and enterprises; to guarantee  proper agricultural development; and to promote enterprise  reform without excessive privatisation.    And in view of the rapidly declining health of patriarch  Deng  Xiaoping, the Central Committee will also deliberate on measures  to ensure political stability after his death.    "The Third Plenum held last November endorsed a blueprint  for  bol+d market reforms," the source said. "The Fourth Plenum will  in some ways rectify the Third Plenum resolution by determining  what the authorities must do to prevent market forces from  exacerbating dislocations such as inflation."    It is expected to be called in the autumn after the  leadership and party elders hold their annual informal meetings  at the Beidaihe summer resort in August.    The Central Committee is expected to institutionalise ways  to  prevent localities from earmarking too much funds for  outside-state-plan projects. Mechanisms will be put into place  to guarantee sufficient acreage for grain and essential produce.    And in the course of the reform of state enterprises,  Beijing  will ensure that its hold on state assets will not be weakened  and that not too many workers will become dispossessed.    Analysts said the theme of the forthcoming plenum dovetailed  with the policies of President Jiang Zemin and economic tsar  Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji, who believe in the need to use strong  macrolevel measures to keep market forces within acceptable  channels.    It is understood that a team of drafters under Mr Jiang and  Mr Zhu has started work on a resolution to be passed at the  Fourth Plenum.    According to a report in yesterday's edition of the  pro-Chinese Hong Kong daily, Wen Wei Po, the plenum would be  devoted to "the problem of management under the new system" of a  market economy.    The newspaper reported that while Beijing would mainly rely  on economic levers and legal means to regulate the economy,  "executive means are still required under certain circumstances".</p>

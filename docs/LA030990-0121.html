			<p><P> March 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SMALL BUSINESS / JANE APPLEGATE: HOW TO PASS ALONG A FAMILY BUSINESS  </P> <P> After 36 years of making pierogies, stuffed Polish-style pasta pockets, Ted  Twardzik figured it was time to sell the family owned business he began on his  mother's kitchen table.  </P> <P> By 1986, Ateeco Inc.'s 200 workers were producing four million pierogies a  week. The company had become the largest employer in Shenandoah, an eastern  Pennsylvania coal-mining town with a population of 7,000.  </P> <P> With sales approaching $15 million a year, Twardzik said he did not feel  qualified to develop the company into a major player in the food industry. And,  although his two youngest sons, Tom and Tim, were interested in stepping in,  Twardzik felt they did not have the maturity or experience needed to build the  company.  </P> <P> "The big problem is that if your business is successful, the estate taxes make  it almost impossible to pass it along to your children and grandchildren,"  Twardzik said.  </P> <P> So, for two years, the Twardziks met with several prospective buyers, going as  far as signing letters of intent with two different companies. With Tim and Tom  at his side during negotiations, Twardzik said he watched them mature.  </P> <P> Finally, with coaxing from his sons, Twardzik said he decided not to sell the  business. Last November, the elder Twardzik became chairman. Son Tom, 29, took  over as president and Tim, 31, became vice president of marketing.  </P> <P> To make sure his employees were turning to his sons for direction, the chairman  moved into a private office in the Elks Club building he owns down the street  from his home.  </P> <P> Today, the family is in the throes of completing its succession plan, which  includes the establishment of trusts, stock transfers and the purchase of  insurance. The goal is to create a plan that will not only preserve as much  wealth as possible, but provide for the company's future growth. Ateeco is also  planning to form an outside board of directors to add new perspectives to their  future plans.  </P> <P> The Twardziks face what millions of small, family-owned businesses are facing  every day: how to pass the company along to the children without losing most of  it to Uncle Sam.  </P> <P> The task is so onerous that fewer than one-third of the country's family-owned  businesses make it to the second generation, according to Leon Danco, founder  of the Cleveland-based Center for Family Business.  </P> <P> Uninterested children, squabbles over control and heavy state and federal  estate taxes all work against the perpetuation of family business in America.  Yet families like the Twardziks, who turned to estate planners for advice, have  been able to work out the difficulties and keep the business intact.  </P> <P> "The classic plan is to leave the business to the wife," said Ronald Hartwick,  an attorney who specializes in estate planning at U.S. Trust of California in  Los Angeles. "But if all you have is that pure vanilla Pablum plan, it can be a  disaster."  </P> <P> Hartwick, who has designed estate plans for about 200 small-business owners,  said too many families focus on minimizing taxes rather than dealing with the  broader issues of who will actually run the business. He and other estate  planners recommend sitting down with your family and discussing the future much  the same way you would plan a vacation.  </P> <P> "It's important to create a plan that the next generation will not tear apart,"  said Hartwick. "The inheritance business brings out the worst in people."  </P> <P> He encourages small-business owners to be as generous as possible while they  are alive. Every taxpayer is allowed to give away $10,000 every year, tax-free  to an unlimited number of individuals. And, under current federal tax laws,  everyone is entitled to pass along $600,000 tax-free to their children or  anyone else. This means, if properly planned for, a married couple with a small  business could transfer $1.2 million worth of property tax-free.  </P> <P> As good as they may be, your day-to-day attorney and accountant may not be the  best ones to draft an estate plan. They will, however, be able to recommend  experts in the field. And you should be prepared to spend between $3,000 and  $15,000 on the completed plan, depending on the complexity of your business and  personal affairs.  </P> <P> For many families, buying a very large insurance policy to cover the business  owner and his or her spouse becomes an attractive way to cover estate taxes and  administrative costs. If you assign the rights to the policy to someone else  and survive for at least three years, the proceeds may be paid to your heirs  tax-free.  </P> <P> The premium on a $1-million policy is in the $20,000 a year range, depending on  the age of the person insured. The best person to consult for this type of  insurance is a Chartered Life Underwriter, who belongs to a professional  organization that requires its members to take tough examinations and continue  their professional education.  </P> <P> The late publisher Malcolm Forbes -- whose empire would definitely not be  regarded as a small business -- used life insurance to provide his heirs with  tax-exempt benefits to pay estate taxes.  </P> <P> Whether the money comes from insurance or savings, your family should have  enough cash to buy out family members who do not want to retain any ownership  in the company. The money should also provide financial security for the  remaining spouse and be a comfort, rather than something to be fought over.  </P> <P> Steve Swartz, a partner in the accounting firm of McGladrey &amp; Pullen in  Minneapolis, said most entrepreneurs are more concerned about the continuity of  their business than saving money on taxes.  </P> <P> "Most want to enjoy the business they created and then enjoy the prospect of  having it continue at least one more generation," said Swartz, who has  counseled about 200 family business owners on organizational and succession  issues.  </P> <P> In trying to be fair, Swartz said, many family business owners put too much  weight on equally dividing the business between their heirs.  </P> <P> "One man I worked with kept a notebook with six columns, one for each child,"  said Swartz. "He had kept track of what he gave each one from the time they  were children."  </P> <P> But Swartz said in reality it is not possible to treat all the children  equally, especially if some are involved in running the business and others are  not. "Leaving the business equally to all of your children is a recipe for  disaster."  </P> <P> Swartz and other family business counselors said the parents must consider  their own financial security before starting to divide up and give away their  business.  </P> <P> Apart from considering taxes and technicalities, a successful estate plan  should begin with a full and frank discussion of your family's goal and dreams.  </P> <P> And, although you want to hear from your children, Swartz said estate planning  should not be a democratic process.  </P> <P> "Discuss your plans, but don't ask your kids to vote on the plan," advises  Swartz.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Environmental Rules to Be Seminar Topic  </P> <P> "Environmental Issues of the 90s," is the theme of a seminar set for Tuesday.  The session is aimed at helping real estate owners and investors deal with new  environmental regulations. The session begins at 8:30 a.m. and will be held at  the Stouffer Concourse Hotel, 5400 W. Century Blvd., Los Angeles. For  information call: 213-454-8030.  </P> <P> </P> <P> ESTATE PLANNING  </P> <P> Sit down with your family and discuss what you envision for the future of your  business.  </P> <P> Create an estate-planning team of professionals who specialize in family  business issues.  </P> <P> Be sure you and your spouse have updated and properly written wills.  </P> <P> Evaluate the cost benefits of buying life insurance to cover estate taxes and  other expenses.  </P> <P> Choose people you trust to manage your affairs after your death.  </P> <P> If no relatives are qualified or interested in carrying on the business, spend  the next few years preparing to sell to a qualified outsider.  </P></p>

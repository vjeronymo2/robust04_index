Although launches of space  rockets long have been commonplace for the local inhabitants, in  every case excitement prevails.    In a city with a population of 50 000 it is the military  personnel, sometimes risking their lives, who constitute the  "backbone." Two major accidents have occurred here, in 1973 and  1980. Nine died in the first case and more than 50 in the second.    The official date of founding of Plesetsk, initially a  defense base whose R-7 intercontinental missiles were aimed at  the United States, is set at 15 July 1957. In 1964 a decision  was made to reoutfit and reorient the Plesetsk rocket facilities.    Today four types of boosters (Soyuz, Molniya, Tsiklon,  Cosmos) are launched from the northern spaceport and nine types  of satellites are put into orbit for scientific and economic  purposes: Bion, Resurs, Foton, Molniya, Meteor, Okean, Musson,  AUOS, Nadezhda. Military satellites also are launched from here.    Launches at Plesetsk take place from nine launch complexes  scattered over the Arkhangelsk taiga. Rails, along which rockets  with satellites are transported from the hangars of the  repair-test facilities, extend to the launch pads. The launch  pad for the Tsiklon-3 booster, for example, prior to the arrival  of a rocket is an extremely modest concreted surface with a  rise. However, when a rocket is brought up an erector rises from  the ground surface and this is used in bringing the rocket into  a vertical position. After several minutes it occupies its  initial position.    The most dangerous stage in preparing rockets for launch is  their fueling. The fuel used is ultratoxic asymmetric dimethyl  hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide. Specialists fill the tanks of  their stages while wearing gas masks and special protective  suits because this is a fuel which if it gets on the skin  threatens very severe burns. The quantity of fuel for each type  of rocket is different, but in any case it is more than 100 tons.    The soldiers of the military space forces have several  prelaunch traditions. The commander never scolds his  subordinates at the launch pad. If any irregularity is  discovered, it is rectified under exceptionally calm conditions.  On the other hand, after the launch a "flight debriefing" is  carried out. Prior to each launch of any booster the last person  to leave the launch pad is the commander, the head of the  military unit, thereby taking all responsibility on himself.    At the present time Plesetsk is the busiest spaceport in the  world: almost 70% of all Russian satellites are launched  from  here and for the time being it is the only cosmodrome in the  Russian Federation. In contrast to Baykonur, heavy boosters of  the Proton type, carrying space vehicles into distant space and  into stationary orbits, as well as manned ships, are not  launched from here.    In addition, the project for constructing the Alpha  international orbital station, as well as the further  implementation of the Russian- American Mir-Shuttle program, are  oriented on launches of boosters solely from Baykonur (territory  of a "third" country, Kazakhstan).    However, Major General Anatoliy Ovchinnikov, chief of the  Main Center for Tests and Use of Space Equipment, feels that his  facility is best suited for the solution of these problems. The  territorial location of the cosmodrome, far from the equator,  which requires a greater power for the launch of some space  vehicles into orbit, gives rise to some problem which, to be  sure, is solvable. On the other hand, precisely the Arkhangelsk  taiga and tundra -- a poorly populated terrain -- are convenient  for regions of falling of spent rocket stages. In addition, here  there is a minimum effect from the radiation field, which is  important for the purity of scientific biological experiments.    At Plesetsk, asserts the head of the cosmodrome, there is no  need to undertake new construction, only to complete some  structures and to carry out reconstruction of the "habitat." The  buildup will require about five billion rubles in 1992 prices,  three billion of which have been promised by the president of  Russia. For the time being even the reception of guests is an  enormous problem. Although several buildings are called hotels,  to adapt to existence in them is extremely tough: the paint is  peeling from the walls and the ceilings in places threaten to  come down on your head; they are scarcely heated, so that in  winter it is necessary to sleep in one's outer clothing and hot  water also is not to be had.    According to the "native inhabitants" of Mirnyy, they do not  live much better. By no means do all of them have apartments,  they live in common quarters where conditions are even worse  than in the hotels. The same conditions apply with respect to  heat and hot water.    As stated by Anatoliy Ovchinnikov, many of the personnel,  especially from the Ukraine, have virtually disappeared from  Plesetsk, whereas many of those serving at Baykonur, where  things are getting worse, are striving to resettle in the north.  And nevertheless there are insufficient personnel for the full  staffing of military units: highly qualified specialists receive  the same pay as the remaining military personnel, plus a  differential for serving in the north which is "eaten up" by the  higher prices in the stores.    There also are many difficulties with the development of  space equipment. For example, only a few specialists who  assemble solar cells for space vehicles have remained in Russia.  This very intricate manual work requires not only high  professionalism, but also infinite patience: from platelets  measuring only a few millimeters it is necessary to "glue  together" a panel of solar cells whose area is several square  meters.    Despite all these difficulties, by investing considerable  sums in Plesetsk, according to Anatoliy Ovchinnikov, by the year  2000 it could be made ready for launches of heavy boosters and  manned ships. However, according to the calculations of  specialists of the military space forces, it would be more  efficient to spend this money on constructing a new cosmodrome  in the Far East. At Plesetsk, evidently, only the launch pads  for intermediate-class boosters of the Zenit type will be  completed and at the future eastern cosmodrome by the beginning  of the 21st century there will be two launch facilities for  boosters of the Proton type, but in a more modern variant which  is ecologically clean.</p>

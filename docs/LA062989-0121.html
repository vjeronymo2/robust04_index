			<p><P> June 29, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> A Czechoslovak underground publisher was jailed for 2 1/2 years, the longest  prison term handed down for dissident activities in Czechoslovakia in recent  years, a leading activist said. The sentence for Frantisek Starek was announced  as police warned Vaclav Havel, the country's best known dissident, that he runs  the risk of being sent back to prison. Havel was freed from prison in May after  serving half of an eight-month jail term. Starek was convicted of incitement,  according to Petr Uhl of the Charter 77 human rights movement. Starek, the  editor of the underground journal Vokno (Window) was arrested in February.  </P></p>

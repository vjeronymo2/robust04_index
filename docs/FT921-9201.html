			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report Copper broke out of its recent range on the LME after a surge on Comex at midday took March above Dollars 1 a lb on technical buying. Three-month metal on the LME broke through resistance at Dollars 2,200 a tonne, and further gains are seen if prices hold above Dollars 2,210. However, commission house selling was evident above Dollars 2,200 and as there are no fresh fundamental developments, the market could retreat if it does not establish a new range above Dollars 2,220, dealers said. LME aluminium prices succumbed to late profit taking after an afternoon rally on talk that the giant Krasnoyarsk smelter, Russia's second largest, had threatened to close unless the new export regime imposed earlier this year is lifted. Nickel prices were mostly under pressure from liquidation and concern that recent Chinese purchases may be unwound. New York raw sugar futures were holding on to light gains by midday after falling to the lowest levels since August on Tuesday. Analysts said slack demand and ample supplies were keeping sentiment bearish. In Chicago wheat was again down at midday following limit losses on Tuesday. New York March cotton was ahead by the 2 cent limit at midday on aggressive buying. Compiled from Reuters</p>

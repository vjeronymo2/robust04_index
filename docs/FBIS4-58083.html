			<p>BFN     [Text] Jerusalem, April 29 (AFP)--PLO chairman Yasir  'Arafat should enter the West Bank town of Jericho in the first  week of June, a senior Israeli negotiator said Friday [29 April].    "There is nothing to stop Yasir 'Arafat going to Jericho as  soon as the autonomy agreement is signed on Wednesday," said the  official who refused to be named.    "But he will no doubt wait until the first week of June when  the Israeli army has completed its withdrawal and redeployment,"  the negotiator told journalists aboard a return flight to Tel  Aviv from Cairo where an agreement to launch autonomy was  reached on Thursday.    The official also confirmed that besides freeing 5,000  Palestinian prisoners after the agreement is signed, Israel and  the PLO had decided that Palestinians opposed to the peace  process could also be released from jail.    But he explained: "We are ready to envisage such releases  only if the prisoners make a written commitment (renouncing  violence) and if their hands are not stained with (Israeli)  blood."    Negotiations would continue on the fate of the 9,000  Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails, he said.</p>

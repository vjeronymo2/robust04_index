			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Evening Information Review" newscast] </F>   [Text] Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina reiterated  the Cuban Government's position to deny departure permits for  people who forcibly occupy foreign missions. He also denounced  foreign encouragement of the actions.    The Cuban foreign minister made the statements during a  meeting with members of the Freedom To Travel group, a U.S.  group that challenges their country's laws by visiting Havana.    Robaina told the visitors that all those who occupied the  Chilean Consulate had already left and that 21 persons remain at  the German Embassy and another 73 at the Belgian ambassador's  residence. The foreign minister said that while some people are  resorting to actions like this, the U.S. Interest Section has  denied visas for 40,000 applicants.    Robaina told the members of the Freedom To Travel group,  which is made up of some 190 persons from 25 U.S. states, that  Cuba has a basic sense of responsibility and that is why it  insists that diplomatic missions be protected and not trespassed.</p>

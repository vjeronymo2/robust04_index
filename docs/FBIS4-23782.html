			<p>BFN     [Text] In response to President Ben Ali's appeal in his  opening speech of the 30th OAU summit, in which he called for  the drawing up of a code of conduct to organize relations  between the African continent's countries on the basis of their  commitment to the principles and goals of the Organization of  African Unity and the United Nations -- for this is of great  importance for preserving the security of African societies and  their stability.    At the end of its meetings in Tunis today, the 30th OAU  summit approved a declaration that included a set of rules in  this regard and in which African countries stressed the  following:    1. Their intention to intensify political consultations and  to broaden the scope of cooperation in order to sort out  economic, social, environmental, cultural, and humanitarian  difficulties.    2. Their will that Africa be a source of peace and be open  to  dialogue and cooperation with the rest of the world, supportive  of exchange in all spheres, and committed to, or collective  solutions to, the challenges of the future.    3. Their full support for the United Nations and their  commitment to promoting the United Nations' role in establishing  security, peace, and justice in the world.    4. Their full conviction for fraternal relations between the  nations and that peace, justice, stability, and democracy  require the protection of the ethnic, cultural, linguistic, and  religious identities of all African people including national  minorities by creating suitable conditions to allow such  protection.    5. Their intention to combat all forms of racial and ethnic  hatred, all forms of separation between individuals, and all  acts of oppression for religious or ideological reasons.    6. The renewal of their determination, in accordance with  the  commitments stipulated by the UN Charter and the obligations  stated by the OAU Charter, to abstain from using or threatening  to use force against the territorial integrity or the political  independence of any state and from behaving in any way that  contravenes the principles of the above two charters.    7. Their condemnation of all terrorist acts and methods and  their intention to intensify cooperation to eradicate such acts  and methods.    8. Their commitment to take decisive measures to avoid  potential conflicts through political means including regional  peace initiatives, to turn to the African body in question when  such conflicts occur, and to look for new ways of solving  conflicts and new measures to settle disputes peacefully.    9.

Their commitment to take necessary measures to prevent  territories of African countries from becoming home to training  camps where terrorists are trained or terrorist operations are  planned in order to destabilize or threaten the security or the  territorial integrity of member states or other states or their  people.    11.

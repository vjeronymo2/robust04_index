			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / A-Z of Personal Finance (22): Two routes that help to cut the risk - Unit and investment trusts THE RECENT corporate collapses of Polly Peck and Maxwell Communications have illustrated the risks of share-picking for small investors. One way to reduce those risks is to buy into unit or investment trusts. Each invests in a wide portfolio of shares, so that even a collapse such as Maxwell's will have only a small effect on the overall value of the fund. Their different names reflect different structures. Unit trusts are what is called open-ended funds, which means that the fund can increase or decrease in size depending on investor demand. If the fund is worth Pounds 100m and investors buy another Pounds 10m worth of units, then the fund manager will have to buy a further Pounds 10m of shares to increase the size of the portfolio to Pounds 110m. If sales of Pounds 20m are then made, the manager will have to sell Pounds 20m worth of shares. As a consequence, the value of the units is always directly related to the value of the fund. If the fund is worth Pounds 100m, and there are 100m units, then each unit should be worth 100p (ignoring, for the moment, the bid-offer spread). Investment trusts, in contrast, are closed-end funds. They are companies quoted on the stock exchange with a set number of shares, which is rarely changed. Investors buy and sell the shares from each other, instead of, in the case of unit trusts, directly from the manager. The price of investment trust shares, while broadly related to the value of the portfolio, is also governed by supply and demand. If more investors want to sell than buy shares, the share price will fall, regardless of whether or not the value of the portfolio has fallen. It is thus unlikely that the share price of an investment trust with Pounds 100m of assets and 100m shares would be exactly 100p. Normally, the trust's shares would stand at a discount to asset value at, say, 90p. This factor creates an extra risk for those who back investment trusts. If they buy when the discount is narrow and it then widens, they will have lost money, even if the value of the portfolio is unchanged. Of course, the opposite is true; if the discount narrows, then the investor gains, even if the value of the portfolio has not risen. A narrowing of discounts has occurred over the last few years, with the result that the performance of investment trusts has been far better than that of their unit trust rivals. The average investment trust made a gain of 50.5 per cent over the five years to January 1, compared with a rise of just 30.1 per cent in the average unit trust. Investment trusts have revived demand for their shares among private investors, partly through monthly savings schemes, partly through ingenious tax-efficient share structures, and partly through paying commissions to intermediaries to sell them. This last factor, in particular, has started to erode one of the perceived advantages of investment trusts over unit trusts - their lower costs. Typically, unit trust investors pay an initial charge of between 5 and 6 per cent - of which around half normally goes to the salesman - and 1 to 1.5 per cent in management fees. Annual management fees on investment trusts tend to be below 1 per cent, and the initial spread depends on the liquidity of the trust's shares. In January, for example, the spread on shares in the largest trust, Foreign &amp; Colonial, was just over 1 per cent; while the spread on the small Capital Gearing trust was 10 per cent. Lower costs have been another factor behind the outperformance of investment trusts. But the cost structure of M&amp;G's Income Investment Trust, launched last year, was almost bang in line with unit trust industry standards. This factor, together with the proliferation of investment trust launches in 1991 and 1992, could mean that unit trusts will bounce back in the 1990s. If investment trust managers swamp demand with new issues, discounts will widen; and the share price performance will suffer. But arguments about the relative merits of the two kinds of trust should not blind investors to the very real advantages that each can offer. Better-off private investors may be able to build up a UK share portfolio of their own. But for most people, the only sensible way to get access to overseas shares is via a unit or investment trust. The industry has gone out of its way to provide for every conceivable investor interest - from East Germany to Latin America, and from Spain to New Zealand. And via split-capital investment trusts, an investor can pick and choose the nature of his investment - from shares that pay a high yield but incur a capital loss, via zeros which offer no yield but steady capital growth, to warrants which grant the investor a way of gambling on a sharp upward move in the market. All this is accessible, through a savings scheme, for as little as Pounds 25 a month, making unit and investment trusts the obvious starting point for anyone interested in the stock market.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- HOW THEY DIFFER  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- UNIT TRUSTS                         INVESTMENT TRUSTS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Not quoted on the stock market      Quoted on the stock market  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Investor buys units                 Investor buys shares  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Priced on asset value               Priced on supply and demand  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Number of units in issue rises      Number of shares in issue remains and falls as investors buy and      constant sell units  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Cannot borrow                       Can borrow  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Investor pays initial charge of     Investor pays brokers commission of 5-6 per cent, included in           1.5 to 2 per cent (less in savings bid-offer spread                    scheme) plus 0.5 per cent stamp duty                                     plus market buy-sell spread  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Annual management charge of 1       Annual management charge of 0.5 to to 1.5 per cent                     0.75 per cent  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

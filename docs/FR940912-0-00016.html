			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. USPAP ``Departure Provision''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The regulations amend &sect;614.4265(h) to remove the prohibition on the use of the USPAP ``Departure Provision.'' The removal of the restriction will allow institutions to determine the best evaluation method to support the credit decision consistent with safe and sound lending practices that also best serves the borrower. The elimination of this restriction will also provide more flexibility for the institutions in the use of their appraiser resources by allowing State licensed and certified appraisers to complete updated appraisals and collateral valuations that would not otherwise meet the USPAP standards requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FCA and the Federal regulatory agencies originally included the restriction on the use of the ``departure provision'' because they were concerned that the use of the provision would result in an evaluation that is less than reliable. However, upon further discussion and clarification from the Appraisal Foundation, <FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>  the Federal regulatory agencies now recognize that a ``departure provision'' appraisal provides the basic information and valuation criteria required to ensure a reliable valuation process. <FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>  Therefore, the prohibition on the use of the ``departure provision'' has been removed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 12 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Appraisal Foundation was established on November 30, 1987, by professional appraisal organizations, as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not-for-profit corporation under the laws of Illinois, in order to enhance the quality of professional appraisal practices. The USPAP standards were developed and published under the direction of the Appraisal Standards Board of the Foundation. The Foundation also consists of the Appraisal Qualifications Board, which establishes the education and qualification standards for appraisers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 13 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Appraisal Standards Board's (ASB) statement on Appraisal Standards No. 7,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Permitted Departure from Specific Guidelines for Real Property Appraisals <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> , was adopted by the ASB on March 22, 1994, and became effective July 1, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> F. Technical Amendments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The regulations make technical amendments to subpart F pertaining to issues such as an institution's review requirements for appraisals completed by other financial institutions or government agencies. The FCA has eliminated the review procedures from &sect;614.4255(d), because it is recognized that other U.S. Government agencies,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Government-Sponsored Enterprises and/or Federally regulated financial institutions are all guided in their appraisal requirements by USPAP and FIRREA requirements, which are at least as encompassing as FCA's regulatory requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the regulations make technical amendments to part 614, subpart L, concerning an institution's responsibilities for accepting an independent appraisal completed in response to a credit denial action. In addition, the regulations make changes to part 618, subpart G, concerning an institution's obligation to provide applicants with copies of collateral evaluations on residential properties as required by amended provisions of regulations implementing the Equal Credit Opportunity Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commenters, responding to the FCA's ``Regulatory Burden'' notice, requested clarification as to the appropriateness of providing time limits on how long an applicant can delay a credit reconsideration while waiting for the completion of an independent appraisal. The FCA believes that this is a valid concern, which should be addressed by a revision to the regulation to require the completion of the evaluation within a reasonable timeframe, depending on the nature and complexity of the appraisal assignment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FCA has also noted that the Federal Reserve Board's amendment of Regulation B, the regulations that implement the ECOA, requires that System institutions provide copies of collateral evaluation reports, containing all pertinent information, to unsuccessful applicants for credit that would have been secured by residential real property. Therefore, the FCA's current regulations pertaining to the release of information must be revised to expressly permit the release of collateral evaluation information when required by the provisions of the ECOA and related regulations. The ECOA regulations generally require the institution, in the case of residential properties, to provide the applicant a copy of the complete evaluation report including any third-party information if it is used as part of the institution's evaluation process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> System institutions should note that, in those cases where disclosure of such collateral evaluations is required by the ECOA, there is no protection for confidential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> third-party information. Therefore, System institutions should avoid the use of such confidential information where disclosure is likely under the ECOA (i.e., loans secured by residential properties, including farmland loans where a dwelling is taken as part of the security). Confidential third-party information does not include information that would otherwise be publicly available (e.g., contained in the public land records).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> G. Other Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters have expressed concerns with the level of requirements and standards for collateral valuations on real estate and, in particular, the requirements for personal property valuations and the use of the income approach for evaluations. The commenters objected to requirements they felt were not consistent with the requirements imposed by the other regulators on their regulated banking institutions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / International Company News: Steel division boosts BHP Strong growth in the steel division helped Broken Hill Proprietary, the Australian steel and resources group, to an after-tax profit of ADollars 1.28bn (USDollars 927.5m) for the year ended May. The figure compares with profits of ADollars 991m in the previous 12 months, rising to ADollars 1.19bn with abnormal items, including a ADollars 203.8m tax benefit. There were no abnormal items in the 1993-94 accounts. Although the result was broadly in line with analysts' forecasts, BHP shares fell sharply in the generally weaker Australian market yesterday. They closed down 24 cents at ADollars 17.74. The steel side registered a profit of ADollars 537.1m on revenues of ADollars 6.89bn. This was more than twice the previous year's ADollars 242.5m, before abnormals. BHP attributed the advance to lower unit costs - thanks to higher production levels - and the combination of an improved domestic market and higher export returns. In the minerals division, it notched up profits of ADollars 681.7m, some ADollars 8.8m above the underlying 1992-93 figure. This year's figure was boosted by the consolidation of earnings from the Ok Tedi copper mine in Papua New Guinea, where BHP last year acquired the minority interest previously held by Amoco. The petroleum division saw an 8.5 per cent profit improvement - again, pre-abnormals - to ADollars 500.6m, in spite of the fall in oil prices. The service companies contributed ADollars 135.7m, up from ADollars 75.8m, mainly due to the receipt of ADollars 71.1m in dividends from Fosters Brewing Group, in which BHP is a shareholder. BHP chief executive, Mr John Prescott, said the group had not adjusted the carrying value of its 37 per cent stake in Foster's, because it expected this 'to be restored over time'. There had been speculation that BHP might write down the holding, currently in its books at ADollars 2.16bn.</p>

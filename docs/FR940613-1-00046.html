			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ``Production of petroleum'' includes, but is not limited to, activities involved in the production of crude oil or other forms of petroleum, as well as the production of petroleum products from purchased materials, either domestically or abroad. ``Refining'' includes the processes of cracking, distillation, separation, conversion, upgrading, and finishing of refined petroleum or petroleum products. ``Marketing'' includes the distribution, transfer, or sale of petroleum or petroleum products for wholesale or retail purposes. A holder who stores petroleum products in USTs for on-site consumption only, such as to provide heat to an office building or to refuel its own vehicles, is not considered to be engaged in petroleum production, refining, or marketing for the purposes of the UST regulatory program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Indicia of Ownership <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA is proposing that ``indicia of ownership'' means ownership or evidence of an ownership interest in a petroleum UST or UST system. EPA is not proposing to limit or qualify type, quality, or quantity of ownership indicia that may be held by a person for the purpose of the regulatory exemption. The nature of the ownership interest may vary according to the type of secured transaction and the nature of the holder's relationship (such as that of a guarantor or surety). Accordingly, indicia of ownership may be evidence of any ownership interest or right to an UST or UST system, such as a security interest, an interest in a security interest, or any other interest in an UST or UST system. For purposes of this proposed rule, examples of such indicia include, but are not limited to, a mortgage, deed of trust, or legal or equitable title obtained pursuant to foreclosure or its equivalents, a surety bond, guarantee of an obligation, or an assignment, lien, pledge, or other right to or form of encumbrance against an UST or UST system. Accordingly, it is not necessary for a person to hold actual title or a security interest in order to maintain some indicia or evidence of ownership in an UST or UST system. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Primarily To Protect a Security Interest <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA is proposing that the term ``primarily to protect a security interest'' as used in this proposed regulation means a holder's indicia of ownership are held primarily for the purpose of securing payment or performance of an obligation. EPA intends this phrase to require that the ownership interest be maintained primarily for the purpose of, or primarily in connection with, securing payment or performance of a loan or other obligation (a security interest), and not an interest in the UST or UST system held for some other reason. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A security interest may arise pursuant to a variety of statutory or common law financing transactions. While a security interest is ordinarily created by mutual consent, such as a secured transaction within the scope of Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code, there are other means by which a security interest may be created, some of which may or may not be the result of a consensual arrangement between the parties to the transaction. In general, a transaction that gives rise to a security interest within the ambit of this proposed rule is one that provides the holder with recourse against an UST or UST system of the person pledging the security; the purpose of the interest is to secure the repayment of money, the performance of a duty, or of some other obligation.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See generally <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  J. White &amp; R. Summers,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Handbook on the Uniform Commercial Code <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  &sect;22 (2d Ed. 1980);  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Restatement of Security <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (1941). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a matter of general law, security interests may arise from transactions in which an interest in an UST or UST system is created or established for the purpose of securing a loan or other obligation, and includes mortgages, deeds of trust, liens, and title held pursuant to lease financing transactions. Security interests may also arise from transactions such as sale-and-leasebacks, conditional sales, installment sales, trust receipt transactions, certain assignments, factoring agreements or accounts receivable financing agreements, consignments, among others, provided that the transaction creates or establishes an interest in an UST or UST system for the purpose of securing a loan or other obligation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In contrast, ``indicia of ownership'' held ``primarily to protect [a] security interest'' do not include evidence of interests in the nature of an  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> investment <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in the UST or UST system, or an ownership interest held primarily for any reason other than as protection for a security interest. The person holding ownership indicia to protect a security interest may have additional, secondary reasons for maintaining the indicia in addition to protecting a security interest; maintaining indicia for reasons in addition to protecting a security interest may be consistent with the exemption and this proposed rule. However, any such additional reasons must be secondary to protecting a security interest in the secured UST or UST system. EPA recognizes that lending institutions have revenue interests in the loan transactions that create security interests; such revenue interests are not considered to be investment interests, but are considered secured transactions falling within the proposed security interest regulatory exemption. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. ``Holder'' of Ownership Indicia <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A ``holder'' as used in this proposed regulation is a person who maintains ownership indicia primarily to protect a security interest, however acquired or held. The term ``holder'' includes the initial holder (such as the loan originator) and any subsequent holder, such as a successor-in-interest, subsequent purchaser on the secondary market, loan guarantor, surety, or other person who maintains indicia of ownership primarily to protect a security interest. The term also includes any person acting on behalf of or for the benefit of the holder, such as a court-appointed receiver or a holder's agent, employee, or representative. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, it should be noted that lending institutions, which typically hold a large number of security interests, may also act in some trustee, fiduciary, or other capacity with respect to an UST or UST system. However, this rule does not address circumstances in which a lending institution or any person acts as a trustee, or in a non-lending capacity, or has any interest in an UST or UST system other than as provided in this rule. Because this proposed regulation, as well as the exemption in section 9003(h)(9), addresses only persons who maintain a ``security interest,'' any discussion of persons with other interests or involvement in an UST or UST system is beyond the scope of this proposed rule. Of course, a trustee or other fiduciary with respect to an UST or UST system (or any person who independent of the status as trustee or fiduciary) who holds indicia of ownership in the UST or UST system primarily to protect a security interest may fall within this proposed security interest regulatory exemption. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

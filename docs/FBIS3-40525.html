			<p>Article Type:CSO     [Text]Objectives    Based on revised mid-term plans for the defense capacity  provisions (1991-95), efforts will be made to complete one stage  of technical research and development. To contribute to  improving support at the qualitative level of defense capacity,  in addition to seriously examining remarkable advances in the  latest technology, the promotion of cooperative relationships  between Japan and the United States in research and development  will be considered and the technical R&amp;D position will be  refined. In the business choices that must be reconciled, their  importance and priority are carefully weighed and efforts are  made to promote critical and efficient technical R&amp;D.       -------------------------------------------------------------------------  |        |1993 Bu-|        |        |        |1994 Es-|        |        |  |        |dget    |        |        |        |timated |        |        |  |        |        |        |        |        |Request |        |        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Amount  |Number  |Increas-|Defense |Amount  |Number  |Increas-|Defense |  |        |of Cases|e Over  |Related |        |of Cases|e Over  |Related |  |        |        |Previou-|Costs   |        |        |Previou-|Costs   |  |        |        |s Fisca-|        |        |        |s Fisca-|        |  |        |        |l Year  |        |        |        |l Year  |        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------  |136 bil-|Prototy-|8.1%    |2.9%    |141.1 b-|Prototy-|3.7%    |3.0%    |  |lion yen|pes: 52 |        |        |illion  |pes: 59 |        |        |  |        |        |        |        |yen     |        |        |        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------  |        |Consign-|        |        |        |Consign-|        |        |  |        |ment: 4 |        |        |        |ment: 4 |        |        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------         -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Major Development Projects                                                 |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Project           |Outline           |Development Period|Features          |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |New Medium Range  |This will be used |1994-             |Complex guidance  |  |Air to Air Guided |as the main weapo-|                  |method, directed  |  |Missile (XAAM-4)  |n on the F-15 fig-|                  |fuse, and warhead-|  |                  |hter plane and ha-|                  |s are adopted.

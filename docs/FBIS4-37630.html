			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Nabil al-Mallah, minister of state for </F> people's assembly affairs, by Ibrahim Humaydi in Damascus; date  not given]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Humaydi] What results do  you expect from U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's  coming tour of the region?    [Al-Mallah] Israel is still procrastinating. I cannot see  it being serious in the negotiations, particularly on the Syrian  track. Israel dallies in the negotiations with Syria. I am  therefore not very optimistic about progress in the negotiations  on the Syrian track, but Syria is serious about the peace  process in accordance with the basis on which we participated in  the Madrid conference. President Hafiz al-Asad emphasized at  the Geneva summit that Syria is ready for full and comprehensive  peace in return for full withdrawal and that peace is Syria's  strategic option. Syria is serious about that.    [Humaydi] After the Oslo agreement and the developments on  the Jordanian track, how do you view Arab coordination?    [Al-Mallah] Regrettably, coordination is not at the required  level. There should have been full and effective coordination  between all parties concerned with the peace process. There can  be no doubt that the present Arab situation is not reassuring.    [Humaydi] In your view, what effect does this have on the  Syrian track?    [Al-Mallah] Any separate agreement would ultimately affect  the entire peace process but Syria has fixed principles in its  dealings. No separate agreement between Jordan and Israel would  affect the Syrian position because that position is clear.  Syria wants full withdrawal in return for full peace. I do not  believe a Jordanian-Israeli agreement would change anything as  far as negotiations between Syria and Israel are concerned.  [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><P> December 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: LAND OF WOODEN GODS BY JAN FRIDEGARD TRANSLATED BY ROBERT  BJORK (UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA PRESS: $8.95)  </P> <P> The Vikings hold a curious fascination for modern audiences, but popular  fiction writers and Hollywood film makers have offered romanticized, sanitized  versions of the raiders who terrorized Medieval Europe. In this scrupulously  researched historical novel, Swedish author Jan Fridegard (1897-1968) depicts  the gritty struggle for existence that comprised Viking life in the early 9th  Century. The story focuses not on a handsome, burly, blond warrior but on  Holme, the brooding, dark-haired thrall of a petty chieftain. Fridegard  interweaves Holme's struggle to win freedom for himself and his wife with the  conflict between Scandinavian paganism and the Christianity preached by the  emissaries of Louis the Pious. Robert Bjork's crisp translation represents the  first time Fridegard's highly respected "Holme" trilogy has been available to  English readers. "Land of Wooden Gods" is the first volume; his translations of  the second and third books, "Sacred Smoke" and "People of the Dawn," will be  issued in early 1990.  </P></p>

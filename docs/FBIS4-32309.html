			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed PAP article: "Will Poland Be `Lifted' by Its </F> Helicopters? Decline in World Demand for Arms"]    [Text] "In general, there is a perceptible worldwide  decline in the demand for weapons, and suppliers seek new  contractors in order to protect themselves against having to  make production cuts. Even the markets they have ignored before  have now become of interest to them," a high-ranking official  connected with the Polish arms industry told us.    According to him, currently pride of place in the world arms  trade goes to the United States, although Britain has recently  also increased its sales. Arms purchases have fallen from some  $50 billion to approximately $20 billion. Whereas previously  the Russians used to earn half of these amounts, at present  their share amounts to only about $2 billion. It is hard to  explain why Poland is being singled out for attack rather than,  for instance, the Czech Republic, which sells as much as we do.  Recently that country was visited by General Pinochet, and he  certainly would not have been discussing purchases with Jablonex  [costume jewelry manufacturers], especially because he visited  the Brno military technology fair.    Poland used to sell quite a lot of weapons, mainly to the  Warsaw Pact countries but also to the Middle East, our  interviewee added. Commenting on the reports broadcast by the  British television's Channel 4 about the sale of 16 containers  of machine guns to Iraq, he said that journalists preparing the  program displayed ignorance. All guns have serial numbers, and  far too many people would have had to be informed about the  export of so many containers. Lucznik makes only submachine  guns, not rifles; the latter are manufactured at Cegielski and  Tarnow.    "Recently an unidentified foreign journalist called us and  asked whether it was true that we were making new MIG-21's and  selling them to Yugoslavia. Poland has never produced any  MIG's, and, as far as MIG-21's are concerned, they are surely  only wanted, if they are wanted at all, as museum pieces  nowadays," he said, adding that it was impossible to sell  weapons to the countries of the former Yugoslavia because of the  international controls in force. "Only the neighboring  countries would possibly be able to smuggle something in there,"  he commented.    "As far as Iraq is concerned, it is well known that weapons  filter in there mainly via the Kurds. Poland had sold tanks to  that country, and, consequently, if we were accused of supplying  them with spares, that would at least make some sense. Arms  sales have to make economic sense, and that is the only  criterion," the official insisted.    In his opinion, we should be developing our arms industry.    "The Hungarians buy from both East and West. This way they  cushion themselves against political pressures and exigencies.  We could easily be making money from our industry, and that is  precisely what many states are unhappy about, because, for  instance, out of all of the countries of the former USSR [as  published], we are the only one that manufactures helicopters,"  he added.  <H5>  [Box, p 6] </H5>    -  Polish arms exports have declined by about 85 percent  since 1988, and orders from the Polish armed forces have  declined disastrously.    -  Since 1965, the Polish arms industry has  produced 11,000 tanks, 6,800 self-propelled howitzers, 1,600  artillery tractors, about 9,000 armored personnel carriers,  6,000 helicopters, and 1.5 million submachine guns, as well as  munitions.    -  Between 1984 and 1991, Poland exported weapons worth  $1.8 billion and 7 billion transfer rubles.    -  Between 1979 and  1989, exports of tanks earned Polish industry $2.5 billion.  More than 80 percent of arms were exported to the former USSR.</p>

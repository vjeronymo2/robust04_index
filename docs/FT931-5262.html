			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Markets: What Lex said about Barclays' 1988 rights issue The sheer scale of the appetite for capital of the London clearing banks never ceases to amaze. But even so, Barclays' Pounds 921m rights issue, coming only three years after it raised Pounds 507m, is breathtaking both in its size and its arrogance. Here is a bank whose performance over the last few years has been modest at best, asking shareholders to stump up the equivalent of more than three years of retained earnings to enable an aggressive new management team to embark on an untested growth strategy. If Barclays had been a US bank trying to sell this message on Wall Street, it would have been almost certainly shown the door. Fortunately for Barclays, shareholders on the east side of the Atlantic appear less concerned about dilution of earnings and net asset value, and seem to have a trusting faith in the management's ability to put the money to good use. Nevertheless, the sharp sell-off in bank shares yesterday signalled the general unease with Barclays' pre-emptive strike. UK banks, which account for less than 5 per cent of the total market capitalisation, have accounted for nearly a fifth of the total equity capital raised in the UK over the last five years, and their appetite shows no sign of abating. Now that Barclays has announced that it wants to dislodge NatWest from the top spot, it is not beyond the bounds of possibility that the latter might return for another monster slug. Barclays argues that it needs the extra money to boost its market share. But given the stage in the economic cycle, this might not be the best time to begin pumping even more credit into the UK economy. Barclays had the worst bad debt experience during the last recession and credit quality is one of the first casualties of any bid for increased market share. But at least Barclays will soon have plenty of capital to cushion itself against its future bad debts. The Lex Column: April 8 1988</p>

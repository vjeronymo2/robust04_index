			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Viktor Litovkin: "On Land, in the Air, and at </F> Sea the Supreme Commander in Chief Tests the Nuclear Forces"]    [Text] On Wednesday President Boris Yeltsin supervised  full command headquarters exercises on command and control of  the Strategic Nuclear Forces, which were conducted by the  Russian Defense Ministry on 21-22 June.    The supreme commander in chief's visit to the building in  Arbatskaya Square and the General Staff Central Command and his  presence at the very intensive training session for alert-duty  personnel, working with headquarters and main commissariats of  the Strategic Missile Forces, Navy, and Air Force scattered all  over Moscow and Moscow Oblast and their military units in the  North and in Siberia, ended with dummy launches of three  strategic missiles. His visit to the military was the first  occasion in the history of our state when the leader of the  country has personally seen how and in what actual situation the  decision to use nuclear missiles might be formulated.    Command headquarters exercises on strategic nuclear forces  command and control are traditional in all countries possessing  these weapons. They are conducted at least two or three times a  year. At the end of May, for example, a strategic offensive  forces training session took place in the United States and a  Minuteman-3 ICBM was launched.    The Russian president's presence at the routine command  headquarters exercises of the Strategic Nuclear Forces has  nothing to do with saber-rattling or with demomstrating nuclear  might on the eve of the meeting of the heads of the eight  leading world states on the island of Corfu and in Naples, your  IZVESTIYA correspondent was told at the Defense Ministry. It is  merely connected with the new political, military, and  military-technical situation following the signing of Russia's  agreement with the United States and Britain on not aiming  ballistic missiles at one another.    On 30 May we stated that our strategic missiles are on  "zero"  elevation. So Boris Yeltsin has to know how the leaders of the  strategic nuclear triad would act in a hypothetical dangerous  period and how quickly and accurately they would be able to aim  Russian ballistic and cruise missiles in the required direction.    Journalists notified of these exercises by ITAR-TASS and  INTERFAX reports waited to greet the president outside the  General Staff building, but he did not come out to address  representatives of the press. But the exercises passed off,  according to my information, without any hitches.    According to confidential information in my possession,  several divisions of the Strategic Missile Forces' RS-12M  "Topol" mobile ground system participated in the exercises.  Some of them carried out maneuvers in the forest near  Novosibirsk, and one, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel  Sergey Sergeyev, went to a prearranged spot in the Plesetskiy  test range in Arkhangelsk Oblast and launched a missile in the  direction of the Kura test site in Kamchatka. The division  fired from a regular launcher a missile that had been placed on  alert duty back in December...1984.    So we were able to check the reliability and technical  readiness of these missiles for combat operation, I was told at  the Strategic Missile Forces Main Staff, and, at the same time,  to train officers, who now have a rare opportunity during their  period of service to launch a real strategic missile.    At the same time as the "Topol" was flying to Kamchatka a  group of Tu-160 strategic bombers was in the air above Russia.  On a command from the Air Force central command and the General  Staff central command the crew headed by Lieutenant Colonel  Sergey Danilchenko launched a long-range cruise missile. A  Northern Fleet nuclear-powered missile-armed submarine [atomnyy  podvodnyy raketonosnyy kreyser] commanded by Captain 1st Rank  Aleksandr Zheltyakov, on alert duty in an area of the Barents  Sea, launched a ballistic missile in the direction of the test  range on an order from Moscow.    All the missiles carried dummy rather than nuclear warheads,  of course.    The fact that the full command headquarters exercises on  Strategic Nuclear Forces command and control and the launching  of three strategic missiles coincided with 22 June, a sacred  date for most Russian citizens -- the 53d anniversary of the  start of the Great Patriotic War -- was pure chance, I was told  by the military. According to the schedule approved back at the  end of last year, the exercises were to have started a day  later, but it was decided to change the date at the president's  request because he was flying to Corfu.    Finally. Comparisons are odious, but in 1799 a  Russian-Turkish squadron commanded by Russian Admiral Fedor  Ushakov stormed the island and fortress of Corfu, which was  occupied by the French. Russia's military success served to  strengthen its international authority and was the foundation  for its new relations with the states of Europe.    Two hundred years on, on the eve of the meeting in Corfu  with  the heads of the leading states, Colonel Boris Yeltsin, supreme  commander in chief of the Russian Federation Armed Forces, sent  a Black Sea Fleet squadron to the island's shores and tested the  combat readiness of his Strategic Nuclear Forces by launching  three strategic missiles. But it is clear today that military  success is not going to restore our state's former authority  without victories in the economy, of course.</p>

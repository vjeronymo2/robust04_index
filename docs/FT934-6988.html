			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / International Company News: Yamaha profits 24.2% down at halfway mark Yamaha, the world's largest producer of musical instruments, hit a discordant note, with first-half profits nearly a quarter down. Pre-tax profits declined by 24.2 per cent to Y2.93bn (Dollars 27.4m) in the six months to September, a reflection of a saturated domestic market for pianos, sluggish consumer spending and the reduction in the yen value of export earnings caused by the Japanese currency's rise in value. Yamaha posted a 58.7 per cent fall in profits for the year to last March which prompted a boardroom coup, after union demands that management accept responsibility. But the group's fortunes appear to have taken a dive since the end of the first half. It is making losses in the current half, on the basis of Yamaha's forecast of a taxable profit of Y1bn for the full year to next March, nearly a third of the Y2.8bn made last year, on sales of Y320bn. First-half sales this year fell 4.8 per cent to Y172.14bn. Yamaha announced an unchanged interim dividend of Y3 a share, more than twice covered by per-share earnings of Y6.31, down from Y8.89 a share in the same period of last year.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["It Is Life and Soul of Socialist Cause To Ensure </F> Uniformity of Ideology and Leadership"--KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, April 14 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today  dedicates a signed article to the 20th anniversary of the  publication of "Let Us More Firmly Establish the Monolithic  Ideological System in the Whole Party and the Whole Society", a  famous work of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il (April 14,  1974).    The article says it is the greatest feat of the dear leader  Comrade Kim Chong-il that he put forward the great idea and  policy of establishing the monolithic ideological system in the  whole party and the whole society and has successfully applied  it and made the revolutionary ranks one socio-political organism  in which the leader, the party and the masses are united closely.    It stresses that the party has raised it as a fundamental  question decisive to the future and destiny of the cause of the  party and socialism to ensure uniformity of ideology and  leadership and brilliantly carried it into practice.    Comrade Kim Chong-il is quoted as saying:    "Our party raised anew the principles of establishing its  monolithic ideological system to meet the requirements of the  development of the revolution in the 1970s when the modelling of  the whole society on the chuche idea was put to the fore and has  further deepened this work."    The article goes on:    He published a famous work "Let Us More Firmly Establish the  Monolithic Ideologikal System in the Whole Party and the Whole  Society" on the basis of a scientific analysis of the practical  requirements of the development of our revolution, and set forth  the outstanding idea and theory of more firmly establishing the  monolithic ideological system in the whole party and the whole  society.    This idea and theory of our party comprehensively  consummates  the principled requirements for further deepening this work in  keeping with the demand of a new higher stage of modelling the  whole of society on the chuche idea, and revolutionary policies  for its realisation. This idea and theory is an original one  which was the first in history to systematize and perfectly  standardize all the theoretical and practical matters arising in  the establishment of the monolithic ideological system in an  integral way on the basis of the revolutionary outlook on the  leader, and a great one indicating the road of accomplishing the  revolutionary cause of chuche.    The exposition of this great idea and theory which has  brought about a revolutionary change in the building and  activities of the Workers' Party of Korea and in the struggle  for accomplishing the socialist cause is a noble expression of  the unshakable will of Comrade Kim Chong-il to purely inherit  and accomplish the revolutionary cause started by the respected  leader President Kim Il-song.    The immortal exploits performed by the WPK in the work for  establishing the monolithic ideological system in the whole  party and the whole society lie in that it has built up a great  army of revolutionaries of chuche type unfailingly loyal to the  party and the leader and made the revolutionary ranks an  integral whole in ideology and purpose in which the leader, the  party and the people shaje the same destiny.    Another exploit of the WPK in the work for establishing its  monolithic ideological system finds expression in that it has  wrought great miracles in socialist construction by intensifying  its leadership over the revolution and construction.    The article further says:    The imperialists and reactionaries are trying to stifle  Korean- style socialism more frantically than before. But, we  are resolutely fighting against the enemy without any  vacillation because we have the firm singlehearted unity around  the party and the leader, a powerful independent national  economy and self-reliant national defence. This clearly proves  the wise leadership and great exploits of the WPK which has  successfully led the work for establishing the monolithic  ideological system in the whole party and society.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Panta Dzambazovski: "Retirement from the </F> Institutions of the System"]    [Text] After the interview with Arben Djaferi, president  of the PDP [Party for Democratic Prosperity] radical faction,  and vice president Menduh Taci that was published in the 26  March edition of our newspaper, some matters related to the  division within the largest party of the Albanians in Macedonia  [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] are  becoming clearer. The conflict within the PDP is not at all  naive, and it involves two irreconcilable currents. Both claim  to have the right to the name PDP. The radical faction,  according to the statements, doesn't intend to negotiate with  the group of delegates and ministers, it considers them "old  communist personnel," "Gligorov's men," "participants in the  silky communist transition of Macedonia." The intention of the  radicals is to create Albanian "cultural" institutions in  Macedonia, "without entering the Macedonian political space."  What is not clear is whether they have parallel institutions in  mind, as well as the question for or against autonomy to the  Albanians, except for the fact that such projects as "Ilirida"  in the past were ridiculous. What is not only of great concern  to the members and PDP fans, but also for Macedonia in general  is the struggle for the name of the party. The radicals are not  alone in having no intention of forming, that is registering, a  new party with another name or a suffix to the name PDP, but are  also resolute in fighting for the name until the end. Even if  the state, or the competent bodies, don't allow them to enter  the Fall elections with their candidates under the name of PDP,  they have announced that they were backed by "an enormous  membership, which should mean something," and that there was a  "counter project" planned, as Djaferi stated, if such a decision  is taken by the authorities. And if the state takes such a  decision, it is clear that the actions will be outside the  institutions. Taci added they had all the facts on their side,  and if the police tried to solve the dispute "anything may  happen."    It seems that these statements were certainly meant to warn  of the possibility of arousing the people, which certainly  represents the worst and most dangerous variant, an experiment  that has taken place in other regions. How large the membership  is and who the "people" behind them are cannot be divined,  however, in some chance situations, a statement about an alleged  "hunt against the Albanians" can sometimes be sufficient to  invalidate all the political efforts for coexistence.    In a situation where the delegates and ministers are  continuing their political engagement in the institutions of the  system, we can conclude that the goal of the radicals is to  discredit the people in authority and in the institutions, in  order to force the delegates and ministers to retire from the  government.    The example of the Tetovo assembly is very characteristic. A  normal police action in which a number of Albanians were  arrested for the illegal possession of arms and explosives  became a political problem. The assembly convoked a session on  that topic, it invited Ministers Frckovski and Gosev, it even  demanded the presence of President Gligorov. The delegates  connected this case regarding the 10 accused with the creation  of a paramilitary army, although the competent bodies said it  was not the case and that the police would perform their duties  no matter which nationality was involved. Of course, is there a  country in which a local authority discusses a number of people  caught with arms, asks for their liberation, and moves the  process in another direction? There are opinions that the Tetovo  assembly is testing its possible future activities as a parallel  institution (parallel parliament).    It is worthwhile mentioning that the PDP delegates in the  Tetovo assembly are 90 percent dedicated to the radical group,  headed by the head of the delegate group. They are working  under the direction of Taci's and Djaferi's group. Some sources  claim that the session dedicated to the arrested Albanians and  attended by the PDP ministers had the unique goal of  discrediting them as representatives of the authority that is  "carrying out arrests," so as to make them retire from the  government, thus increasing the possibility of actions outside  the institutions.    Due to the intensified actions of the radicals, there is  evidently increased nervousness among the delegates' and  ministers' group, which is trying hard to create a new image in  the period before the elections by saying that the authority is  supported by Taci's group (following the session with the  government), issuing information about the arrested Albanians,  and accusing the authority of which, by the way, they are a  part. Before that it demanded that the court decide about the  legitimacy of the PDP, and, because of unfavorable reactions  among the Albanian radical political factors, it withdrew the  charges. Apparently the delegates' and ministers' group is  making mistakes in the new situation, which is not the case with  the radicals. The basic mistake is that it is trying hard to  show itself in a different light and be what it is not. As long  as it is so, the radicals will be on the offensive.</p>

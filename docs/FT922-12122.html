			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / Leading Article: A Lloyds bid for Midland LLOYDS Bank will decide later this week whether to attempt to buy Midland Bank in the teeth of an agreed bid by Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. It should summon up its courage and press ahead. To urge Lloyds to bid is to fly in the face of received wisdom, which argues that the UK banking sector is already too concentrated, and that hostile bids for banks are at best unseemly and at worst disastrous. There is truth in both these arguments; but the case for a Lloyds bid is strong enough to over-ride them. Lloyds is the best managed of the big UK banks. The point of its bid would be to integrate two UK domestic branch banking networks, aiming for huge cost savings - some Pounds 500m a year or more. Since Lloyds is likely to offer its shares in exchange for those of Midland, the gain would accrue to both sets of shareholders. The scale of the potential gains is a strong argument for a bid: it indicates the extent to which the historic pattern of banking in the UK has left the country with too many branches and too much managerial and clerical infrastructure to support them. Throughout the 1980s, despite the potential savings from computer technology, the big banks continued to allow their staffs to grow. In the last couple of years, individual banks have at last started to make big cuts in staffing and branch networks. Full integration However, only a full-scale integration of two banks is likely to bring about the scale of cost-cuts the industry needs. By transforming its own cost structure, a merged Lloyds/Midland would put enormous pressure on its big rivals, National Westminster and Barclays, to make corresponding savings. Customers would benefit along with shareholders. There is another important lesson from the scale of the potential savings: it illustrates a drawback of the existing bid, from the Hongkong Bank. In that bid, potential cost savings are much smaller: the Hongkong Bank argues instead that it could run Midland better than it has been run up to now, helped by its stronger capital base. Midland could certainly use more capital; but the Hongkong Bank's record of managing large overseas businesses is not encouraging. Indeed, it is hard to think of a single cross-border bank acquisition in a developed economy which has proved a resounding success. Domestic mergers of overlapping banks, though still risky, have a better record. So much for the advantages of a Lloyds bid; what are the potential drawbacks? The first is that, by taking on Midland's problems, Lloyds itself might be fatally weakened. A year ago, with the scale of Midland's difficulties still unclear, that uncertainty might have been enough to render a Lloyds bid imprudent. Now, with the benefit of a new management's unsentimental judgment of the Midland books, the risk looks far less, as the timing of the Hongkong bid indicates. Potential drawback A second potential drawback is the harmful effect on competition of reducing Britain's Big Four banks to a Big Three. In most of the UK's financial services markets, however, there is abundant competition, which would not be lessened by a merger. Retail banking for individual customers, wholesale banking for large companies, investment banking for corporate finance customers - in all these markets, a customer can pick and choose at will between fiercely competitive suppliers. This is not true, however, in one of the most politically sensitive areas of banking: lending to small businesses. It lacks the new entrants - from abroad, or from the building society sector - which have made the the rest of British banking so competitive. Building a nationwide network of bank managers experienced in assessing the credit-worthiness of small business is an expensive business. This is why the new entrants have not rushed to do so; it is also an argument against allowing the elimination of one such network. Balancing that issue against the gains to competition from transforming the banking system's cost structure is a task for the competition authorities. Fear of such an investigation should not deter Lloyds from going ahead.</p>

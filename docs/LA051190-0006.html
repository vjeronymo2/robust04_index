			<p><P> May 11, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POVERTY FACTOR IN IMMIGRATION  </P> <P> Father Boyle expressed the economic and social tragedy facing millions of  Mexican and South American immigrants.  </P> <P> And the good father is right -- it is our duty to help out the less fortunate.  But the Catholic Church's generous offer of U.S. tax dollars isn't going to  solve the problem. Modern birth control will solve the problem. If women used  their God-given intelligence and reproduced responsibly, a great deal of  poverty would be eradicated.  </P> <P> PAMELA CANDELORE  </P> <P> Escondido  </P></p>

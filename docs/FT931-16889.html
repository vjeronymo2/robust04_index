			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / Europe 1993: The single market and you - All you ever wanted to know about a frontier-free Community What is the single market? A market without borders allowing free movement of people, goods, capital and services for the 344m people in the EC's 12 nations. It also aims to harmonise technical standards, regulations and enforcement procedures. First agreed in 1985 under Single European Act, it is to be extended later in 1993 to another 24m people in Austria, Finland, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Sweden. What language should I speak to master it? In the EC, 23 per cent speak German as their first language, 18 per cent English and French, 17 per cent Italian. Man sollte Deutsch lernen. How will it affect the European economy? Could be a recession-beater - but don't count on it. Optimistic EC report in 1988 claimed market would add 4.5 per cent to EC's GNP in medium-term. Because of anticipatory surge in investment during last few years, Brussels officials say 30 per cent of that has already worked its way through. Will it make me better off? Yes, if you or your company can profitably reach extra customers. No, if you fail to adjust to extra competition. If you are among the EC's 16m unemployed, don't expect miracles. Why are some companies complaining? Scrapping of customs posts means new value added tax and statistics collection system, increasing the workload for thousands of EC companies. More changes may come in 1997. Will my life be ruled by bureaucrats in Brussels? They initiate legislation, but the counter-blast of public discontent during 1992 means they are now shy about pushing member states around. Remember: governments agreed the directives and must implement and enforce them. So watch out for bureaucrats in national capitals as well. Which country will fare best? Could be the Netherlands. It already has the largest proportion of exports going to other EC countries (76.5 per cent). And it registered the largest intra-EC trade surplus in 1991 (Dollars 21bn). Will big companies or little ones be the main winners? Many big companies have already adapted through mergers, rationalisation, distribution shake-ups. Small flexible companies with keen eye for buying/selling opportunities on niche markets likely to fare best. Will I still need a passport to travel around Europe? Yes. Britain, Denmark and Ireland retain internal border controls on people. The nine others won't end passport checks before mid-1993 at earliest. If you want to complain about barriers, ring the Euro Citizen Action Service frontier control hotline in Brussels (this week only): 322-5348325; Fax: 5345275. Can I vote in the French national elections next spring? Under the Maastricht treaty, EC citizens living in other EC countries can vote in local elections. But, even after Maastricht ratification, you will be able to vote in French legislative elections only if you have French citizenship. How much beer and how many cigarettes can I now carry across internal EC borders. How much can I spend on gifts to take home? Reinforce the estate car's axles: you can bring home as much as you like, tax-paid, as long as you can make out a good case that it's for personal consumption. National customs authorities have set certain limits, representing quantities estimated for personal use, but these are non-binding. Customs may make spot checks and may seek proof you're going to drink those 200 cases of champagne yourself - or at least serve them at your daughter's wedding. How much can I buy in duty-free shops? Limits unchanged, but duty-frees for travellers within EC to be abolished from July 1999. No more border checks so harassed duty-free shop assistants will have to enforce the rules themselves. Will the Community be swamped with immigrants? In theory, external frontiers will be strengthened, tougher rules applied to asylum-seekers and illegal immigrants. What about the Mafia? Are cross-border crime and drugs smuggling bound to increase? Drugs, criminals, stolen property, pornography may circulate more freely, and there may be a boom in single market crimes, such as bootlegging cheap cigarettes. But border law-enforcers are now mobile, and - if governments can agree on HQ for Europol organisation - co-operation on terrorism and drugs will improve. Will food become more or less hygienic? More, says Brussels. Less, say consumer groups, fearing that strict national measures will be dropped. In fact, zealous national officials have tightened up EC requirements in some states, but that has prompted complaints that granny will have to install an expensive new kitchen if she wants to go on selling home-made scones. Will tax authorities in EC countries pool information, catching up on my undisclosed foreign income stashed in a Luxembourg bank account? Beware] Tax authorities are stepping up information exchanges, although no routine swapping of computerised data. But exchange of income tax data is excluded from some bilateral tax agreements, and Luxembourg retains its jealously guarded banking secrecy laws. Will I be able to buy a second home anywhere within the EC without any controls? No. Single market legislation does not extend to property, so you will still have to comply with local legislation. For instance, Denmark has maintained its right to prevent non-resident foreigners buying holiday homes - and this is being specifically upheld in the Maastricht treaty. Can I get my bad back treated in Heidelberg under the German health service? Will the NHS be obliged to treat any EC national? Reciprocal arrangements already in place allow any EC citizen basic health care in a member country. Doctors unlikely, however, to carry out more than emergency treatment. Will my qualifications as an accountant be recognised in Rotterdam? Yes. Most professional qualifications have been acceptable throughout the EC since 1990, with additional measures opening up free movement of everyone from architects to hairdressers. In practice, 'foreign' professionals are still said to face national and linguistic barriers. Will I be able to buy my car in the cheapest country in the Community and drive it home without paying more tax? Buy a new car abroad - free of VAT, unlike other products - and you should be able to drive it home without further formalities. When you register it at home you'll pay VAT on the price at the local rate. From May, manufacturers will publish comparative price lists to help you decide which country is cheapest. Where can I find information on where to buy the best-value video-recorders and CD players? Beuc, the European consumers' organisation, has published EC-wide price surveys - covering CD players, CDs, car tyres, toys, camcorders, compact cameras, stereo radio cassettes, loudspeakers, and electronic pianos. Contact Beuc at Avenue de Tervuren, Bte 4, 1040 Brussels (telephone: 322-7353110), but note that they won't advise you on best buys. Can I use my stockbroker to buy shares anywhere in the EC? Yes, free movement of capital was one of the objectives of the single market programme. Will I be able to take out an insurance policy or pension plan offering benefits in any EC currency? Insurance policies should be sold across borders from July 1994, increasing choice and reducing prices. Pension plans are more difficult  - you should be able to buy one anywhere, but you may not be able to take it with you when you move across borders. Will I be able to take my dog all over Europe without controls? Attempts to make Britain and Ireland scrap tough quarantine rules have failed. You can take your pets to the continent, but they face a long stay in kennels if you try to bring them back. Will I be able to use my portable phone anywhere in the EC? What about electrical gadgets - hairdriers, TV, stereo? You should be able to link to cellular phone networks anywhere in the EC, but Europe may never see a single phone or electrical socket. Don't throw away that universal adaptor.

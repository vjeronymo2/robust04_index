			<p><P> July 9, 1990, Monday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OXNARD;  </P> <P> JOHS ANNOUNCES BID FOR REELECTION  </P> <P> Saying the city still needs a voice calling for fiscal responsibility, Oxnard  Councilwoman Ann Johs announced Friday that she will seek her second four-year  term on the council.  </P> <P> Johs is the first council incumbent to announce her decision to seek reelection  in November.  </P> <P> Mayor Nao Takasugi's two-year term and Councilman Manuel Lopez's four-year term  expire this year.  </P> <P> The filing period begins July 16 and closes Aug. 10.  </P> <P> Johs, who was the Oxnard Chamber of Commerce's first woman president in 1980,  was elected to fill a term left uncompleted after Councilman Tsujio Kato was  recalled in 1984. She was reelected for a full term in 1986.  </P> <P> Johs said she sought a council seat because she felt the council was not doing  enough to keep businesses in the city. Johs said she has been accessible to the  public and has spoken out on fiscal responsibility by voting against pay raises  when she felt that they were gratuitous.  </P> <P> If reelected, Johs said she will continue to try to improve the city's  financial standing, work to relieve its traffic problems and improve air  quality.  </P> <P> Johs suggested last month that the city, facing budget constraints, consider  eliminating its police and fire departments and turning those services over to  the county. The proposal was rejected in a 3-2 vote.  </P> <P> Paul K. Dolan, a distribution contractor, and Scott Bollinger, a self-employed  investor, announced in May that they would seek election to the council. HUGO  MARTIN  </P></p>

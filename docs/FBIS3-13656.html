The hitch, so far, has been an  overly broad application of the Pressler Amendment under which  US military and economic assistance to Pakistan has been cut off  since 1990 on the grounds that the US president has been unable  to certify that Pakistan was not in possession of a nuclear  device nor in the process of acquiring one. But the aircraft  have been paid for out of Pakistan's own funds and the deal  simply should not be subjected to restrictions under this  amendment. However the Congress and, till fairly recently, the  US administration appeared quite content to use this amendment  in order to deny the aircraft to Pakistan and to increase  pressure on it to roll back its nuclear programme. In the face  of Pakistan's refusal to oblige, the US administration appears  to be taking a different tack. It now seems to be inclined to  convince the congress of the merits of allowing Pakistan to  supplement its strength in conventional arms in order to provide  it greater incentive for not undertaking a nuclear weapons  programme. Clearly the latter issue pertains to the country's  perceived security needs and it is for Pakistan to determine  whether it should keep its options open in this context.    To the extent that the reported move by the US  administration  provides some hope that Pakistan will be able to get what it has  paid for is an encouraging development. However, there are all  kinds of lobbies within the US political and governmental  circles that have been active in trying to block the move by  whatever means necessary regardless of the merits of the case.  Meanwhile India has also sought to influence the matter with its  prime minister observing in this regard that if the aircraft  were indeed to be delivered to Pakistan then his country will  also be forced to review its defence requirements. Considering  India's vast superiority in arms over Pakistan this is a  completely untenable argument. In response to informal US  proposals regarding nuclear non-proliferation and resumption of  limited military and economic assistance reportedly received by  the government Pakistan should make its position clear both in  terms of its legitimate security requirements as well as the  importance on the part of the US to meet its obligations under  generally recognised principles governing transactions such as  the F-16 deal. The prime minister's meeting with the U.S.  ambassador on Sunday was probably meant to convey Pakistan's  growing impatience on this issue to the United States  government. The upcoming visit of the chief of the army staff  to the US should also help clarify Pakistan's stand. If the US  still appears prone to hedge on the matter then perhaps the  government will have little choice but to continue to withhold  further payments and take the matter to court in the United  States as it is reportedly contemplating.</p>

			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Murray Johnstone raises Pounds 30m MURRAY Johnstone, the Glasgow-based fund manager, has raised Pounds 30m from institutions for a new fund to finance management buy-outs and acquisitions. The Murray Johnstone Private Acquisitions Partnership is a limited partnership under English law and intends to invest in unquoted acquisition financings in the UK, principally buy-outs and buy-ins. A number of UK, Canadian and US investors have subscribed to the first closing, Murray Johnstone said, and a further closing which could raise a similar amount will take place in the autumn. MJPAP is the successor to the Murray Johnstone LBO Fund which raised Dollars 102m in 1988. It is now fully invested and has returned about 50 per cent of subscriptions to its investors following the flotation of Burn Stewart, a whisky company, and of Yorkshire Food Group, as well as a number of sales of holdings.</p>

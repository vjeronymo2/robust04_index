			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A detained leader of the Communist Party of the  Philippines (CPP) yesterday urged his comrades to continue the  fight against the movement's Europe-based leadership and form a  new party with a strong ideological foundation.    In an interview with newsmen, Arturo Tabara, one of the  communist leaders opposing Jose Maria Sison, said "its never  late" for the movement to make a comeback if all oppositionists  in the party will "unite in forming a new party different from  Sison's." He added, Mr. Sison's view of armed struggle as the  best means to further the party's political agenda must be  changed in order to give way to more important considerations of  the times.    Mr. Tabara revealed that before his capture in Bacolod City  last January, the oppositionists were already planning to  establish a party with a different ideological base.    He has lost touch with his comrades, he said, but he  remained  hopeful of the emergence of the new party soon. Mr. Tabara said  anti-Sisonists equal the strength of Mr. Sison's allies in terms  of membership as they number 9,800 nationwide. He admitted,  however, that Sisonists have more arms because they have more  money.</p>

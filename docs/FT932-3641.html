			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Arts: Rix rattles the Arts Council - An explosive resignation THE GOVERNMENT has started soundings in its search for a new chairman of the Arts Council to replace Lord Palumbo next April Fool's Day. Rumours suggest that the usual suspects have been rounded up, including former arts minister Lord Gowrie, who is not fully stretched these days as chairman of Sotheby's Europe, Sir Nicholas Goodison, an unregenerate arts committee man, and Mary Archer, who would be an acceptable token woman. But the government's task in filling this unpaid job with endless opportunities for nights at the opera has not been made any easier by the explosive resignation this week of Lord Rix (former actor Brian Rix) who for seven years chaired the Council's Drama Advisory Panel and its Arts and Disabilities Committee. Lord Rix was not mealy-mouthed in explaining why he was quitting. 'For more years than I care to think the Arts Council has been viewed with barely concealed contempt by successive Arts Ministers as well as by our clients.' He goes on to accuse the Council of 'fawning' if it receives a reasonable grant from the government, and when, as this year, there is no real increase, behaving 'like lemmings, devising fatuous so-called policies, and strategies, and visions, and corporate plans which are merely feeble attempts to cover up the fact that we have been defecated on from a great height.' As a seasoned farceur his timing was spot on, prompted by last week's report by consultants Price Waterhouse into the workings of the Arts Council. 'Two things really got up my nose', he says. 'Their recommendation to cut back the number of panel chairmen and regional arts board directors on the main Council, and the suggestion that the Council should not go in for social engineering. If the arts are not in the business of social engineering, what are they for?' Behind the specifics is a more fundamental trigger for Lord Rix's outburst. He thinks that the Council has allowed itself to become a football of the government. It should have re-examined its role and future itself rather than submit to an investigation by outside consultants. He feels that through apathy the Council has made itself dependent on its paymaster, the Heritage Minister, and has surrendered the cherished arm's-length principle. One can understand his anger. For years the Council seems to have been churning out reports - on devolution, strategy, internal organisation, as well as specialist working papers. Various arts ministers have played pass the parcel with it: some, like Richard Luce, favouring devolution of its powers to Regional Arts Boards; others, such as David Mellor, basically wanting to make the funding decisions for major clients personally; or, like the current incumbent, Peter Brooke, adopting a laissez faire approach. Lord Rix has a point over the changing attitudes towards 'social engineering.' To a great extent the Council has responded to its bosses. Luce wanted more attention paid to women in the arts, Renton was keen on cultural diversity, Brooke on disability. Their wishes were slavishly followed. Now Price Waterhouse turns all this on its head and says that the Council should return to a mainstream role as advocate of the arts. Of course Brooke can ignore the report. But he seems committed to the Price Waterhouse option of letting the Council carry on much as it is but saving Pounds 850,000 a year by cutting 30-odd jobs, and by putting out such activities as touring to a separate agency. A dispassionate observer may feel that for all the the government's huffing and puffing very little has changed at the Arts Council. Most of the reforms amount to little. After 14 years of Conservative government it remains an entrenched bureaucracy, the arms-length principle still largely intact. It has lost some powers through devolution, but that was very much its own policy pronounced in the 'Glory of the Garden' initiative of the early 1980s. The new chairman's main concern will be money. After three years of generous treatment by the government, which has raised the Council's grant by 27 per cent to Pounds 225m, the cash flow is due to be switched off. In the face of a planned cut of Pounds 5m in its grant for 1994-95 the Council intends to announce in July that it will make strategic arts decisions - instead of shared misery it will divert money away from devolved regional theatres and towards contemporary dance and the visual arts. In the event little more than Pounds 1m or so will be transferred, and although some arts organisations will suffer and claim they face closure, they will probably survive. The real fight over money comes when the government confirms the Arts Council grant in November. Secretary General Anthony Everitt is 'very glum', and fears that the Pounds 5m cut could become Pounds 10m. New chancellor Kenneth Clarke likes jazz but is not often seen in the Covent Garden crush bar, and Peter Brooke shows little enthusiasm for asking for more. The winter may be full of horror stories about bankrupt arts companies. A new chairman will be courted with promises that the structure of the Arts Council has been sorted out, and that there is an exciting new plaything, the national Lottery, to administer. But these plus points will seem less attractive if the long anticipated cash crisis in the arts finally arrives just before he comes into his inheritance.</p>

			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Fast way to explore your files: David Carter reviews Magellan - Computing Once in a while I come across a software package and think: 'This package is terrific. Why isn't everyone talking about it?' That's my feeling about Magellan. Magellan is a 'file management' package from Lotus, producer of the 1-2-3 spreadsheet. It runs under DOS or Windows; price Pounds 115. Magellan will benefit anyone who has a large number of files on their hard disk and needs to keep track of them and keep them organised. I use Magellan constantly. The problem for anyone who does a lot of word processing or spreadsheet work is that over time they build up a large number of files - letters, reports, worksheets, etc - on their hard disk. Such documents are saved under cryptic DOS filenames such as 'JIM. DOC' or 'TAXMAN. WPS'. This is no problem at first, but as time goes on you run out of meaningful filenames to remind you what the document is about. Consequently, a year or two down the line your hard disk becomes cluttered up with lots of redundant files which really ought to be cleared off and the space made reusable, but you cannot remember what they were about so it is not safe to delete them. When this happens you need to be able to go past the name of the file and take a look at what is inside. Enter Magellan. Its 'viewer' facility allows you to go into any document and display the contents on the screen. Unlike the more technically oriented file management packages such as Norton Utilities or PC Tools, Magellan is designed for the ordinary user who has masses of information locked away in files on his or her disk and wants to navigate around and 'explore' them as easily as possible. Hence its name. Magellan splits the screen into two. On the left are listed the directories on your disk. One of them will be highlighted. In the right hand part of the screen Magellan displays the contents of the highlighted directory. As you work your way down the list, Magellan displays the contents of each file being highlighted. It is as if you were in the index at the back of a book. On the left page your thumb is on the first entry of the index. As you move your thumb down each entry in the left page of the index, complete pictures of the pages being referred to are displayed simultaneously on the right page. Simply by using the four arrow keys on your keyboard, you can find and display any document on your hard disk within seconds. And the more files and directories there are, the better it gets. On a network, for example, Magellan gives you a list of all the local drives, and with just a few keystrokes you can see into any file on any machine. This is the definitive way to find your way around hundreds or thousands of data files. Magellan also contains many more useful features. Copying and moving files is far easier and safer than under DOS, for example. When you are installing Magellan, it will ask you if you want to create an index on your files. The program may take an hour to create the index, but it will enable you to make lightning-fast searches of your disk. I recently wanted to find a letter written a couple of years earlier. I could not remember the name of the person I had written to, nor the company. However, I knew they were based in Edinburgh. I chose F9 to explore, pressed right arrow twice, typed in 'EDINBURGH' and pressed enter. Within 10 seconds Magellan had searched through 1,600 files taking up 30 megabytes of data and come up with a list of all the documents containing the word 'Edinburgh'. Complex searches are similarly quick. People pay thousands of pounds for specialist text retrieval packages to do this sort of thing: with Magellan it is thrown in for nothing. As hard disks grow bigger and bigger, it becomes more and more important to have help navigating around them. Magellan is the answer. In particular, for anyone whose computer is several years old with a hard disk that has become cluttered up with half-forgotten documents which need to be cleared off, it is indispensable.</p>

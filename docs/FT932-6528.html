			<p>930527 FT  27 MAY 93 / International Company News: Philips nears deal on unit sale PHILIPS, the Dutch electronics group, is negotiating to sell its German-based telecommunications cable business to NKF Holding, a Dutch unit of Nokia of Finland. The move follows the failure earlier this year of talks between Philips and Siemens, the German electronics company, on combining their cable activities into a joint venture. Philips declined to reveal its asking price. Its cable manufacturing plants in Cologne and Nuremberg employ 1,100 people and generate annual sales of DM350m (Dollars 214.7m). Philips said its plant in Cologne would phase out the production of copper cable before being transferred to NKF. The acquisition will mean a big increase in size for NKF, which has annual turnover of Fl 443m (Dollars 246m). NKF is a former Philips subsidiary which left the group through a management buy-out in 1986. Nokia later built up a stake of nearly 60 per cent in the company. Fokker, the Dutch aerospace group, is exploring a possible partnership in space technology with Matra Marconi of France, AP-DJ reports.</p>

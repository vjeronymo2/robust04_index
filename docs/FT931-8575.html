			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / International Company News: Hewlett-Packard boosted by record orders HEWLETT-PACKARD, the US computer and electronics manufacturer, reported higher than expected first-quarter earnings. The quarter, ended in January, is the first since Mr Lewis Platt succeeded Mr John Young as president and chief executive in October, when Mr Young retired. Net earnings were Dollars 261m, or Dollars 1.03 per share, compared with a net loss of Dollars 30m or 12 cents per share in the first fiscal quarter of 1992, when HP took an after tax charge of Dollars 332m to reflect a change in accounting for retiree health care benefits. Excluding the charge, HP had net earnings of Dollars 302m or Dollars 1.19 per share in the first quarter a year ago. Wall Street analysts had been predicting net earnings of around 96 cents per share. HP's stock jumped sharply yesterday, closing Dollars 4 5/8 up on the day at Dollars 72 1/4 . Revenue for the quarter totalled Dollars 4.6bn, compared with Dollars 3.9bn in the same period last year. US revenues were Dollars 2.1bn, up 24 per cent, while revenues from outside the US rose 14 per cent to Dollars 2.5bn. The company noted that acquisitions accounted for about three percentage points of the growth in revenues. New orders booked during the quarter were a record Dollars 5.2bn, up 24 per cent, signaling strong revenues in the future. US orders totalled Dollars 2.1bn, up 18 per cent over 1992, while orders from outside the US grew by 28 per cent to Dollars 3.1bn. 'We're extremely pleased with our growth in orders, which was well balanced by business and geography,' said Mr Platt. 'Our revenue growth was strong and earnings were good, even though they were lower than those of our outstanding first quarter of 1992. 'The year is off to a good start,' he added. 'Our challenge is to turn strong order growth into higher profitability. We're cautious, however, because continuing order growth depends in part on worldwide economic conditions, which still show signs of weakness in key geographies. 'We're encouraged by the success of our new products, and we're finding opportunities even in this tough environment. Our focus will remain on the strong product programmes and lean organisations that success requires.' Operating expenses for the first quarter rose 11 per cent , with about 2 percentage points of this increase due to the effects of acquisitions. Operating expenses fell as a percentage of net revenue from 34.7 per cent in 1992's first quarter to 32.5 per cent. 'We're very pleased with the progress we've made on reducing operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues,' said Mr Platt. 'We must continue our efforts to reduce operating expense ratios in all our businesses.' Separately, HP announced that Mr John O'Rourke, formerly of Bellcore and Bell Labs where he had more than 25 years' experience directing telecommunications programs, has joined the company in the newly created position of general manager, Telecommunications Operations, and chief telecommunications architect. In this post, Mr O'Rourke will lead development of an integrated strategy to increase significantly HP's position in the telecommunications industry, the company said.</p>

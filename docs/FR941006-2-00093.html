			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Type B and C test (i.e., LLRT) program provides assurance that containment integrity has been maintained. LLRTs demonstrate operability of components and penetrations by measuring penetration and valve leakage. Additionally, there have been no modifications made to the plant, since the last Type A test, that could adversely affect the test results. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The licensee further notes that the performance of consecutive Type A tests in refueling outages 2R010 and 2R011 to meet the requirements of the TS and Appendix J, would result in additional radiation exposure to personnel. Performing the Type A test during two consecutive refueling outages in order to comply with the TS and 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix J, would result in an unnecessary increased in personnel radiation exposure and increased cost by increasing the length of one of the affected refueling outages. Omitting the test will result in additional dose savings by eliminating contamination and by reducing exposure from venting and draining and from setups and restorations of instrumentation required to perform the test. These factors and the costs associated with an additional test for a 24-month difference in interval are not offset by the benefits of the additional test. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons set forth above, the NRC staff concludes that this deviation from the 10-year service period ending August 1994 is not significant in terms of complying with the safety or scheduling requirements of Section III.D.1.(a) of Appendix J. Accordingly, the staff finds that the additional test would not provide substantially different information and that the intent of Appendix J is met. Therefore, the subject exemption request meets the special circumstances of 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2)(ii), in that the fourth Type A test is not necessary to achieve the underlying purpose of the rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On this basis, the NRC staff finds that the licensee has demonstrated that special circumstances are present as required by 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2). Further, the staff also finds that extending the service period will not present an undue risk to the public health and safety; since the licensee has justified the leaktight integrity of the containment based on previous leakage test results, the staff concludes that a one-time extension of the second 10-year service period and a one-time implementation of an extended test interval will not have a significant safety impact. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12, the Commission may, upon application by any interested person or upon its own initiative, grant exemptions from the requirements of 10 CFR Part 50 when (1) The exemptions are authorized by law, will not present an undue risk to public health and safety, and are consistent with the common defense and security; and (2) when special circumstances are present. Special circumstances are present whenever, according to 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2)(ii), ``Application of the regulation in the particular circumstances would not serve the underlying purpose of the rule or is not necessary to achieve the underlying purpose of the rule.&blank;.&blank;.&blank;.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The underlying purpose of the requirement to perform Type A containment leak rate tests is to provide for periodic verification of the leak-tight integrity of the primary reactor containment. The licensee has demonstrated that the leak tight integrity of the primary containment can be assured the latest test results and by controlling the maintenance activities which affect a primary containment penetration. The Type B and C testing will provide additional assurance of the overall integrity of the primary containment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On this basis, the NRC staff finds that the licensee has demonstrated that special circumstances are present as required by 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2)(ii). Since the licensee has justified the leaktight integrity of the containment based on previous leakage test results, the staff concludes that a one-time extension of the second 10-year service period will not have a significant safety impact. The staff also finds that extending the interval between tests will not present an undue risk to the public health and safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, the Commission has determined that, pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12, an exemption is authorized by law and will not present an undue risk to the public health and safety and that there are special circumstances present, as specified in 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2), such that application of 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix J, Section III.D.1.(a) is not necessary in order to achieve the underlying purpose of this regulation; and hereby grants the following exemption with respect to the requirements of 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix J, Section III.D.1(a). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station, Unit 2, the second 10-year Type A service period is extended such that the third periodic Type A test may be performed during the Unit 2 Refueling Outage 11 currently scheduled for September 1996 and such that the three Type A tests in the second 10-year service period are performed at intervals that are not approximately equal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32, the Commission has determined that the granting of this exemption will have no significant effect on the quality of the human environment (59 FR 50018). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This exemption is effective upon issuance. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated at Rockville, Maryland this 30th day of September 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Steven A.

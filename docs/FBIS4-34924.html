			<p>BFN     [Text] Mexico City, 25 Jun (EFE) -- A group of alleged  members of the Basque terrorist organization ETA [Basque  Fatherland and Liberty] was arrested in the city of Zapopan,  Jalisco State, western Mexico, and is accused of being involved  in homicides, kidnappings, and bank robberies, according to the  Mexican newspaper EL UNIVERSAL GRAFICO. The newspaper reported  the group, presumably linked to the terrorist organization ETA,  was arrested following an extortion attempt in Zapopan.    EL UNIVERSAL GRAFICO cites investigations which the Attorney  General's Office (PGR) has conducted and adds the group under  arrest is involved in the deaths of a citizen from Los Angeles,  (California), a Venezuelan official, and a Mexican businessman.    The group, known as "Los Julupesty," has been committing  "kidnappings, homicides, threats, and thefts in various banking  institutions" in the last few months, the Mexican newspaper has  reported. The arrested men followed "a crime route extending  from Los Angeles, California, to Caracas, Venezuela, passing  through Mexico," the publication reports.    The group is headed by David Gomez, alias "El Chino," a  fugitive of the justice system and an alleged, active, ETA  member, the article added. The arrested individuals, whose  nationalities were not disclosed, are Marcos Gomez Ontiveros,  Ernesto Lopez, Carlos Alberto Ortiz, Daniel Ramirez, Vilma  Ramirez, Carmen Armianca, and Jarry Gomez.    In their first statements before the Jalisco Attorney  General's Office, the seven individuals admitted they had tried  to extort a family in Zapopan through a letter, but the family  notified the police, the Mexican newspaper reported.  The article added the arrested individuals could be involved in  the murder of businessman Mario Gonzalez, who was shot to death  by two individuals in the Mexican port of Veracruz on 1 April.    Likewise, according to the source, they are accused of  participating in the kidnapping and murder of William Munoz,  leader of a gypsy community in Los Angeles who was killed on 21  April because the $1-million ransom that was being demanded was  not paid.</p>

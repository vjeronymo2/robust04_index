			<p><P> June 10, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENTS: A GUIDE TO THE BEST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA: HIGH STYLE;  </P> <P> TABLE TOPPER  </P> <P> IN THE BEGINNING there was the flat surface. Then came legs to support the  surface, and it was called a table.  </P> <P> And one day, New York-based designer Paul Haigh decided to create the Thin Edge  of the Wedge II table "to explore what happens, conceptually, when the legs  push through the table top."  </P> <P> The Thin Edge table won an award in the prestigious 1989 ID Annual Design  Review and is now produced by a fledgling Toronto firm, Ottoman Empire. Haigh  avoided using expensive injection molds or tools and dyes to form the legs.  Instead, each leg is made by simply folding a length of aluminum (a process  that strengthens the legs structurally) to produce the table's namesake  "wedge."  </P> <P> Haigh treats the aluminum top as a "natural" material. "The machine-ground  finish cleans up the surface," he says. "Aluminum doesn't need a protective  coating of nickel or chrome, as steel does." Though the grinding process barely  scratches the aluminum's surface, it yields a rich, deep, light-refracting  finish like the underside of a CD.  </P> <P> Despite the raw materials, the Thin Edge II table -- one of a series of three  pieces -- is quite refined looking. The table, which comes in varying sizes and  shapes (prices range from about $3,500 to $4,500), explores the "cheapskate  architecture" aesthetic identified with Frank Gehry. In the right hands, as  Gehry fans know, inexpensive, off-the-shelf industrial materials such as  corrugated fiberglass, chain-link fence and raw metal can look elegant and  luxurious.  </P> <P>  The Thin Edge is available at (Di-zin'), 8302 Melrose Ave., Los Angeles; (213)  651-4400.  </P> <P> DAVID LASKER  </P></p>

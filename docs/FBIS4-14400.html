			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Gennadiy Charodeyev report: "Treaty With Pyongyang on </F> Military Assistance Still Valid"]    [Text] "In accordance with the existing treaty between the  USSR and the DPRK Russia will provide North Korea with  assistance in the event of unprovoked aggression against it, but  it will decide this solely on the basis of its own analysis,"  Russia Deputy Foreign Minister Aleksandr Panov has said during a  meeting with journalists.    The news agencies took these words as an expression of  support for Kim Il-song's regime. However, the Foreign Ministry  took a calm view of that. They gave IZVESTIYA the following  explanation:    "The Treaty on Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual  Assistance  between Moscow and Pyongyang was signed in 1961. This document  has no time limit -- the sides automatically extend it every  five years. In 1995 we will decide whether to extend it for  another term or sign a new treaty with North Korea. It is valid  today, albeit pro forma, and this means that Russia would  provide the DPRK with the requisite assistance if it decided  that Pyongyang was the victim of aggression. What is more,  under existing legislation the North Koreans will only receive  military assistance once parliament has adopted a corresponding  decision," a Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman stressed.    During his conversation with journalists Aleksandr Panov had  described the situation on the Korean Peninsula as "teetering on  the brink of war."    In the deputy minister's opinion, Moscow's recent initiative  calling for the convocation of an international conference  involving the six interested states -- China, the United States,  Japan, Russia, the DPRK, and the ROK -- along with  representatives of the United Nations and the International  Atomic Energy Agency, is in the interests of a settlement on the  Korean peninsula.</p>

			<p><P> August 20, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN RIGHT;  </P> <P> GOP SHOULD WISE UP ON SOCIAL SECURITY;  </P> <P> SEN. MOYNIHAN'S IMPROVED FIVE-YEAR PLAN WOULD GRADUALLY RETURN MONEY TO  WORKERS' POCKETS. IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE.  </P> <P> Pat Moynihan ostensibly has applied the ointment of compromise to the abrasions  caused by the budget unpleasantness. But he actually could be creating, from  the unpromising material of his fellow Democrats, a serious opposition party.  </P> <P> Moynihan, the Senate's Sisyphus, recently applied his sore shoulder yet again  to the rock that he has been trying to roll uphill. Months ago he proposed  cutting, within just two years, Social Security taxes, putting the system on a  pay-as-you-go basis. This would have shut the spigot from which now gush  surpluses generated by the increases put in place in 1983.  </P> <P> Those increases were supposed to build "reserves" for when, around 2020, baby  boomers retire. The reserves, now flowing in at $1 billion a week, are  scheduled to rise to $3 billion a week in 1997 and even more after that. But  they are being used to finance government operations, thereby masking the real  size of the deficit. (The real deficit is forecast to be $241.8 billion in  fiscal 1991, not counting the cost of the savings-and-loan shambles.)  </P> <P> Moynihan's aim was -- is -- to force honesty in budgeting and equity in  taxation. However, his party, the conservative (meaning resistant to change)  party, flinched from his radicalism and from the need to think (about equitable  taxes to replace the Social Security revenues). But now comes Moynihan's  compromise: Phase in the rate cuts over five years.  </P> <P> For someone earning the maximum income taxable for Social Security purposes  (about $54,300 next year), the savings during 1991-1995 would be $1,900. In  1996, the wage earner would be saved $708. The tax rate would not rise again  until 2010 and would not reach today's rate until 2015. Moynihan says 132  million Americans are paying a rate that is a quarter of a century premature,  on a tax that is inequitable in its current use -- financing the government's  general operations.  </P> <P> This tax, which for 74% of taxpayers is a bigger burden than the income tax, is  regressive: It has a flat rate and is not applicable on income above $51,300.  Because of the 15.3% Social Security tax on earnings (including the employer's  portion), most workers in the 15% income-tax bracket pay a total tax rate  higher than paid by the richest Americans. The richest are in the 28% bracket,  but any income in excess of $51,300 is exempt from Social Security taxes.  </P> <P> C. Eugene Steuerle of the Urban Institute notes that if fringe benefits, such  as employer-paid health insurance, are thought of (as they should be) as  income, then two workers with equal incomes can have significantly unequal  Social Security tax burdens. A worker with $30,000 cash wages will pay $1,200  per year more than a worker whose $30,000 in earnings include $8,000 in fringe  benefits. That means a five-year difference of $6,000 in tax bills.  </P> <P> If this regressive tax is not cut, by the end of this decade it will slurp up  $200 billion a year more than Social Security will pay out that year. Moynihan  says the money is not needed now for Social Security, so leave it with the  workers who do need it: "The soul of the Democratic Party is at stake."  </P> <P> Talking about that party's soul is what philosophers call a category mistake,  like talking about the wit of Brussels sprouts. But consider the political  consequences if Moynihan's tax cut for 132 million Americans were to pass in  September with the support of most Democratic senators and opposed by most  Republicans.  </P> <P> For a quarter of a century, since George Wallace got their attention,  Republicans have celebrated Joe Sixpack, a fellow of hearty but simple  appetites -- beer, not Scotch. The courtship of Joe Sixpack is going to be  complicated enough if Republicans, busy campaigning for a capital-gains tax  cut, vote against the cut in Social Security taxes. And that might not be Joe's  only grievance.  </P> <P> Consider the surrealism of Washington these days. The estimate of the number of  S&amp;Ls that will fail has been doubled from 500 to (so far) 1,000. The Bush  Administration cannot say, within half a trillion dollars, the eventual cost of  this black hole for money: Guesses range between $400 billion and $1 trillion.  And while these big numbers are bandied about, Republicans have floated an  itsy-bitsy idea for helping to reduce the deficit by just $50 billion this  year.  </P> <P> (Perspective: $50 billion is less than the deficit number that will be  increased by removing Social Security surpluses from the budget for deficit  calculations. And $50 billion is half of the additional sum sought last week  for this year's S&amp;L spending.)  </P> <P> The Republicans' bright little idea for nibbling at the deficit? A new tax  adding 75 cents to a six-pack of beer.  </P></p>

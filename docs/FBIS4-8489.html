			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 13 Apr (TANJUG) -- At this evening's  session, presided over by Prime Minister Radoje Kontic, the  federal government considered current questions of cooperation  with the UN peacekeeping forces and decided that prior  permission of the Yugoslav Government is necessary for the entry  and movement of UN Protection Forces' [UNPROFOR] vehicles on the  territory of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY]. Visas  from the competent Yugoslav authorities will also be necessary,  from 20 April, for the entry and residence of every member of  the "Blue Helmets" in the FRY, the Federal Information Ministry  has announced.    The federal government assessed that the UN peacekeeping  forces, with their invitation to NATO to bomb Serb positions  around Gorazde, have completely sided with the Muslim side in  the civil war in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, and ignored the  vital fact that it was precisely the Muslim forces, exploiting  the safe zone, which attacked Serb positions first.    The federal government stated these facts with regret and  once again condemned in the sharpest terms this behavior by  UNPROFOR and the armed action of NATO. In the assessment of the  federal government, these acts directly threaten the peace  process and could lead to the escalation of the conflict, not  only in this area but in a broader region.    In its cooperation with UNPROFOR hitherto, the Yugoslav  Govenment was guided by its interest in the cessation of combat  operations as soon as possible and in the reaching of a just  solution through negotiations. It worked to the best of its  ability and within its limited capabilities, to make it easier  for UNPROFOR to perform its functions. The federal government  did this, it was concluded, with huge sacrifices and efforts  under the conditions of the unjustly imposed UN Security Council  sanctions against the FRY, which contravene the UN Charter.    The Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been tasked with  informing the UNPROFOR main headquarters about the conclusions  of the federal government, a statement by the Federal Ministry  of Information says in conclusion.</p>

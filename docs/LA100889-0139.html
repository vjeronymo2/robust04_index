			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INITIATIVE SEEKS TO PUT STATE IN MAINSTREAM OF JUSTICE  </P> <P> Just seven years ago, California voters approved a major change in the state's  criminal law, passing Proposition 8, a broad-ranging anti-crime initiative  known as the Victims' Bill of Rights.  </P> <P> Among other things, the measure mandated stiffer sentences for repeat  offenders, allowed a wider use of evidence against criminal defendants and gave  victims new rights to restitution and to appear at parole and court  proceedings.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, critics of the criminal justice system remain dissatisfied, and  now they are appealing once again to the electorate -- this time with another  initiative, the Crime Victims Justice Reform Act, which authorities say could  result in even more sweeping changes in the legal process.  </P> <P> Backers of the measure are fueled by what they see as unwarranted delay in the  system that denies swift and sure justice and adds to the burden of victims who  must testify repeatedly in protracted proceedings. The 18-month preliminary  hearing in the McMartin preschool child-molestation case and the four-month  jury selection in the Hillside Strangler trial of Angelo Buono are two  frequently cited examples.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Widespread Support  </P> <P> At this point, chances appear good the initiative will be approved. Supporters  said recently that they already have obtained nearly 1 million signatures --  almost double the number required for a place on the June, 1990, ballot.  </P> <P> Oddly, up to now most of the debate on the measure has been focused on a  provision opponents say would weaken the right to abortion -- an allegation  staunchly denied by backers. But that controversy has obscured the much wider  impact the measure could have on California criminal law.  </P> <P> Most notably, the initiative would require that state courts follow federal  rulings in determining criminal procedural rights. State judges would be  allowed to grant defendants no greater protections than the generally  less-expansive rights mandated by the U.S. Supreme Court under the federal  Constitution.  </P> <P> Also, the death penalty would be expanded to cover more types of killings, and  juveniles 16 or 17 who commit murder would be subject to life in prison without  parole. Pretrial proceedings, including jury selection, would be sharply  revised in an attempt to speed the process. And several new procedures would be  adopted to ease the burdens of crime victims, allowing them to appear less  often in court.  </P> <P> Although there is strong debate over the merits of the measure, there is little  doubt that it will result in profound change if enacted -- most fundamentally  in its broad new deference to more-restrictive federal standards on defendants'  rights.  </P> <P> In past years, the California Supreme Court was at the forefront of a movement  to expand rights of individuals beyond federal requirements. But under the  initiative, perhaps a dozen state high court rulings would be overturned or  substantially limited, authorities say.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Central Issue Cited  </P> <P> "Cutting back on the constitutional rights of those accused of crime may or may  not be a good idea -- but that ought not to be the only issue," said Jesse H.  Choper, dean of the Boalt Hall law school at UC Berkeley. "We also should be  looking at the question of whether California should be able to go its own way,  with an independent state judiciary, or be bound by the rulings that emanate  from the U.S. Supreme Court."  </P> <P> Backers say that despite Proposition 8 and a dramatically realigned state high  court that has upheld dozens of death sentences in recent months, the new  initiative is needed to finish the job of reforming the system.  </P> <P> For decades, they say, the previous court under Chief Justice Rose Elizabeth  Bird used the state Constitution to fashion radical and unwarranted protections  for defendants -- and the Legislature did little about it. Although the new  court has overturned or limited some of those rulings, its traditional respect  for judicial precedent has stymied further change, proponents say.  </P> <P> "The chief aim of the initiative is to bring California's criminal justice  system back into the American mainstream," Kern County Dist. Atty. Ed Jagels,  chairman of the Crime Victims' California Justice Committee, said in an  interview. "We took what we considered were the best aspects of the federal  system and the law in other states and wrote them into our measure."  </P> <P> Opponents, led by defense attorneys, contend that the initiative would prove  burdensome on the courts, costly to the taxpayers and unfair to criminal  defendants. The measure, they say, is merely a grab bag of proposals the  Legislature would not accept. If it is enacted, opponents add, it will be  subject to widespread constitutional challenges in the courts for years.  </P> <P> Michael Rothschild of Sacramento, vice president of California Attorneys for  Criminal Justice and leader of a new group opposing the initiative, calls the  measure "most repressive" for its elimination of state-guaranteed rights that  for years have set California apart from the rest of the nation.  </P> <P> Rothschild believes that oversimplified claims by proponents may mislead voters  into passing an exceedingly complicated measure they know little about.  </P> <P> "People are basically intelligent but there are some very detailed, very  complex parts of this initiative that cannot be described in 30-second sound  bites," said Rothschild. "If the Legislature, which is basically conservative  and certainly not pro-defendant, has rejected these things for the past five  years, that ought to tell us something. . . . If this thing passes, I fear for  the people, as well as the system."  </P> <P> The initiative contains dozens of provisions, but the following emerge as its  most important in scope.  </P> <P> DEFENDANTS' RIGHTS  </P> <P> This section would limit defendants' rights to those afforded by the federal  Constitution in a broad field of law. In all, 12 separate rights are involved,  ranging from equal protection, due process and assistance of counsel to  guarantees against unreasonable searches and cruel and unusual punishment.  </P> <P> As a result, a number of state high court rulings establishing more expansive  rights would be cast aside in favor of federal interpretations of the law.  Analysts say the way would be clear, for example, for the revival of capital  charges for "especially heinous" murders, a provision struck down by the state  high court in 1982 as a violation of the state constitutional due-process  clause.  </P> <P> Critics of the measure are seriously concerned over what they see as the  breathtaking scope of this provision. While the 1982 anti-crime initiative  eased the state's judicially imposed restrictions on the types of evidence that  can be used against defendants, this measure broadly redefines defendants'  rights, they say.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Problem Here Called Severe  </P> <P> "This is a wholesale giving up of any independent viability of the procedural  rights under the state Constitution," said Santa Clara University law dean  Gerald F. Uelmen. "This goes well beyond Proposition 8."  </P> <P> Backers acknowledge the provision represents an unparalleled effort to recast  criminal law, one that apparently has not been made in the initiative process  in any other state in recent times. "Other states don't have as severe a  problem as we do in California," said Los Angeles Deputy Dist. Atty. Albert H.  MacKenzie. "We're basically trying to enact what already exists elsewhere."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Abortion Link Raised  </P> <P> The 12 rights limited by this section of the initiative include a defendant's  right to privacy -- a provision that in itself has set off a politically  charged debate over its potential effect on the right to abortion.  </P> <P> Opponents say that if the U.S. Supreme Court overturns its landmark 1973  decision in Roe vs. Wade, which recognized a federal right to privacy in  obtaining an abortion, it would effectively restrict California's  constitutional right to privacy -- and, with it, the right to abortion. Thus,  they say, the way could be opened to prosecutions under currently unenforceable  abortion laws or statutes enacted in the future.  </P> <P> Backers reply, however, that the initiative is clearly aimed at criminal  defendants and does not seek to criminalize any conduct not already prohibited  under valid statutes. The privacy provision is meant to cover cases involving  the surveillance of criminal defendants and is intended to limit a 1982 Bird  Court decision recognizing a right of jail inmates to privacy in jailhouse  conversations, initiative supporters say.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Candidates Get Involved  </P> <P> Although the provision amounts to only two words -- "to privacy" -- among  thousands in the initiative, it has stirred a lively dispute between two  candidates for governor in 1990, Democratic state Atty. Gen. John K. Van de  Kamp and Republican U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson.  </P> <P> Van de Kamp says the provision jeopardizes abortion rights and, although he  favors the initiative generally, he refuses to support it as long as it  contains that provision. Wilson, a prime backer of the measure, replies that it  presents no threat to abortion and that there is no need to revise the  initiative. Now, Van de Kamp says he will place the initiative, without the  privacy provision, in a measure he plans to put on the November, 1990, ballot  that would create a "superfund" to fight the drug problem. Thus, if both  measures were approved, the Van de Kamp version, as the superseding measure,  would ultimately become the law of the state.  </P> <P> DEATH PENALTY  </P> <P> The measure, overturning several state Supreme Court decisions, would prevent  trial judges from dismissing a capital charge, known as a "special  circumstance," that has been found by a jury; would expand the death penalty to  include intentional murder of a witness to prevent testimony in a juvenile  proceeding; and would widen capital punishment to cover murder committed during  a kidnaping, train-wrecking, sodomy, oral copulation or rape by instrument.  </P> <P> The initiative, adopting a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision, also would  permit the death penalty for an accomplice who is a "major participant" in a  felony-murder and acts with "reckless indifference" to human life. Up to now,  the state high court has barred the death penalty for an aider and abettor  without proof of intent to kill.  </P> <P> JUVENILE KILLERS  </P> <P> Although not permitting the death penalty in such crimes, the measure would  allow sentences of life without parole for 16- or 17-year-olds who commit  murders for which adults could face execution.  </P> <P> TORTURE  </P> <P> The initiative would establish the crime of torture, punishable by life in  prison. The provision is a response to the controversy over the case of  Lawrence Singleton, who was paroled after serving only eight years -- the  maximum sentence for mayhem -- for using an ax to sever the forearms of his  15-year-old female victim.  </P> <P> PRETRIAL EVIDENCE  </P> <P> The measure would revise a courtroom rule by which the prosecution must reveal  its evidence to the defense before trial but the defense need reveal little of  its case. Under the initiative, the prosecution would be able to learn the  names and addresses of defense witnesses sooner -- enabling prosecutors to  better investigate alibis -- and to receive written statements made by  witnesses to defense investigators and physical, scientific and psychiatric  evidence the defendant intends to offer at trial.  </P> <P> PRETRIAL DEADLINES  </P> <P> Judges would be required to set a trial date within 60 days of a defendant's  arraignment, unless there were good cause not to do so. In addition, to be  assigned to a case, public defenders and court-appointed private counsel would  be required to attest that they would be prepared to proceed on the date set  for a preliminary hearing or trial. If they failed to be prepared, without good  cause, they could be removed from the case, found in contempt, fined or denied  public-funded compensation. In complicated cases, additional time would be  allowed.  </P> <P> GRAND JURY INDICTMENTS, PRELIMINARY HEARINGS  </P> <P> The measure would overturn a landmark 1978 decision by the state Supreme Court  that gave those defendants indicted by a grand jury a new right to a  post-indictment preliminary hearing. In such hearings, defendants are generally  much better able to challenge the charges against them.  </P> <P> The initiative also makes major changes in the preliminary-hearing process  itself -- the process used in the hundreds of thousands of cases in California  in which defendants are charged directly by prosecutors, rather than through  grand juries.  </P> <P> The measure would eliminate the current requirement that victims and other  witnesses appear at preliminary hearings where they can be cross-examined by  defense counsel. Instead of having witnesses themselves testify at preliminary  hearings, investigating officers would be allowed to present hearsay testimony  on what they were told by the witnesses. This revised process would greatly  speed proceedings and ease the burdens on witnesses, supporters say.  </P> <P> JURY SELECTION  </P> <P> In another attempt to speed the process by following the federal system, the  initiative would direct judges to take the lead role in questioning prospective  jurors -- a task that now is largely in the hands of attorneys and, in some  instances, has taken weeks or even months. The measure also limits the scope of  such interrogations and abandons a 1980 state Supreme Court decision requiring  that jurors in capital cases be questioned separately and apart from others --  another time-consuming process.  </P> <P> Not surprisingly, there is considerable disagreement over whether the measure  would help -- or harm -- the criminal justice system.  </P> <P> Backers of the measure say that the proposed new procedures not only would  speed the process but also would ease the burdens on victims and other  witnesses who spend agonizing months and years awaiting the end of a case. The  1982 initiative gave victims the right to restitution and to attend parole and  court hearings, but they still are called upon for repeated appearances on the  witness stand, forcing them to lose additional time from work and endure other  personal pressures.  </P> <P> Los Angeles prosecutor MacKenzie notes, for example, that in a recent complex  probate fraud case, witnesses were required to testify first before a grand  jury, then at a preliminary hearing and finally -- four years after the case  began -- at trial. "In every federal court in the nation and in 47 states, you  can go first to the grand jury and then right to trial . . . but not in  California," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hearings Called Mini-Trials  </P> <P> MacKenzie cites also the unusual length of some preliminary hearings --  proceedings that too often become full-dress "mini-trials." He notes that the  hearing in one recent insurance fraud case in Los Angeles took eight months.  "It's absurd," he said.  </P> <P> But defense attorney Rothschild contends that stricter deadlines and other  limits on pretrial proceedings place unfair pressures on lawyers and  defendants. Lengthy preliminary hearings, he argues, are actually an exception  to the rule. "You can always find a horror story like the McMartin case or the  Hillside Strangler case, but those are a rarity," he said.  </P> <P> And in any event, he said, they provide defendants with a rightful opportunity  to challenge erroneous identifications and other faulty evidence that could  result in wrongful conviction.  </P> <P> "That's why we have a preliminary hearing," he said. "That's what makes us  different from the Soviet Union."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Greater Court Burden Seen  </P> <P> Law dean Uelmen predicts the limits on preliminary hearings actually would  result in greater burdens on the court system. At present, he notes, defendants  get a full opportunity to test the prosecution's case at such proceedings --  and more than 90% of the time elect to plead guilty without going to trial. By  contrast, in the federal system, where hearings are limited, only 75% plead  guilty, he said.  </P> <P> Uelmen contends that if California alters its system to follow the federal  system, it will need to conduct five times as many trials -- which in turn  would require five times as many courtrooms, judges, prosecutors and public  defenders.  </P> <P> In response, prosecutor Jagels said he expects the initiative, if successful,  to result in more pleas of guilty before trial. With a broadened exchange of  evidence before trial, the defendant's advantage of surprise would be largely  eliminated, he said. The prosecution will have greatly enhanced ability to  challenge the defendant's alibi or other contentions -- and more likely result  in an admission of guilt, he said.  </P> <P> "With reciprocal (exchange of evidence), we'll be able to prove or disprove a  defendant's story before trial," said Jagels. "They'll have to tell us what  they've got . . . just like we have to tell them what we've got."  </P></p>

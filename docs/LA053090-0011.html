			<p><P> May 30, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: VENTURA;  </P> <P> TEACHERS, DISTRICT AGREE ON CONTRACT  </P> <P> The Ventura Unified School District ratified a three-year contract Tuesday with  its 660 teachers, ending a year of bitter negotiations.  </P> <P> The teachers voted last week to accept the contract, which will be retroactive  to July 1, 1989.  </P> <P> The new agreement calls for teachers to receive 50% of the district's revenue  for salaries, down from the 58% they received under the last contract. The  teachers took the cut to retain their health benefits, officials said.  </P> <P> The difference will be pooled with other district funds to pay for health  benefits for all district employees, including retirees.  </P> <P> In March, the teachers had turned down a contract that called for them to help  fund benefits for retirees. Jerry Mittelholtz, president of the Ventura Unified  Educators Assn., said the teachers changed their minds because of "a desire to  get it over with. They looked at the contract and saw it was the best thing  they could have."  </P> <P> Under the new contract, the teachers will receive a one-time $1,000 bonus for  the 1989-90 school year. District officials said the question of whether  teachers' salaries will be raised depends on the amount of state funds  received.  </P> <P> District officials have projected a $1.2-million shortfall and have proposed a  series of cutbacks.

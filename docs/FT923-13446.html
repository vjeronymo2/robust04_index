			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Survey highlights tardy offices THE WELSH Office and the building management section of the Property Services Agency are the worst government departments when it comes to paying their bills on time, according to government figures, Diane Summers writes. Less than 42 per cent of PSA building management bills are paid within the contract terms or 30 days. The Welsh Office, meanwhile, pays 65 per cent of invoices within the period, according to the survey. Top of the prompt payment league is the Inland Revenue, which pays 99 per cent of invoices within 30 days. Other swift payers are National Savings (93 per cent) and the Department of Energy (92 per cent). The DTI itself has an 80 per cent record. The government has recently been exhorting the private sector to help small business suppliers, in particular, by paying bills promptly.</p>

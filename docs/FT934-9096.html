			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / Odd man out spurns 'invite' to Apec's US party: Malaysia's Dr Mahathir plans to stay away from Seattle next week DR Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia's prime minister, is not afraid to be odd man out. Next week, representatives of 15 nations meet in Seattle under the auspices of the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation forum (Apec). After a preliminary ministerial meeting, President Bill Clinton is due to hold an informal summit. With several prime ministers and presidents in attendance, plus 2,000 of the world's media, the get-together will be the highest-level 'confab' ever held in the region. But Dr Mahathir will not be there. The US, he says, is trying to hijack Apec and set an agenda for the less powerful nations of east Asia to follow. 'I would have been happy to go to the summit if the proposal had come from Apec and had been debated and approved, but this is undemocratic. One nation has decided to have a summit and everyone is supposed to go along.' Apec was formed in 1989. Initially, membership comprised the six countries of Asean (the US, Canada, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand). In 1991, the 'three Chinas' joined - China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Dr Mahathir says Apec should remain a loose grouping mainly concerned with helping development of Asia-Pacific's weaker economies. Dr Mahathir, who has increasingly taken on the role of spokesman of the world's smaller nations, says Apec should include all countries on the Pacific rim, including Chile, Ecuador and Peru. Apec, he adds should not be turned into a trade bloc, a free trade area or an economic community, serving the interests of the economically strong countries involved. Yet, according to Malaysia, this is precisely what is happening. 'Apec looks like some kind of a foreign guided jamboree with an imperialistic odour which may be politically exclusive,' says Mr Ghazali Shafie, a former Malaysian foreign minister. There is some support for Malaysia's views. The Asean countries do not want their organisation to be overwhelmed by any new Apec structure, though some are fervent Apec supporters. Washington has denied any plan to turn Apec into a formal trade group, but Asean and other countries in the region are concerned the US might try to use the threat of more concerted Apec action to force the pace of Gatt talks and win trade concessions from Europe. The US has stressed the growth in trade taking place in the Asia-Pacific region. 'In 1991, our two-way trade across the Pacific exceeded Dollars 310bn (Pounds 205bn),' says Mr Paul Wolfowitz, a former US under-secretary of defence. 'That's one third larger than our trade with Europe. The US exports more to Malaysia than to the countries of the former Soviet Union: more to Indonesia than to eastern Europe and more to Singapore than to Spain or Italy.' While east Asia has benefitted from this growth in trade, it does not want Apec to be seen as any sort of alternative to Gatt. 'The last thing we want is to become a bargaining chip between the US and Europe,' one Asean official said. Malaysia has been pushing for the formation of an East Asian Economic Caucus (EAEC) to counter what it sees as the emergence of trade blocs such as the EU and Nafta. This, in many ways, would run counter to Apec, grouping Asean countries and the economies of north-east Asia including Japan and China, but excluding the US and Canada, a grouping one commentator referred to as a 'caucus without the Caucasians'. The EAEC was first suggested by Dr Mahathir in mid-1991 and has since become a central part of Malaysia's foreign and trade policy. Dr Mahathir was personally offended when Mr James Baker, the former US secretary of state, dismissed the idea of an EAEC, saying it would 'draw a line down the Pacific' with the US on one side, and Japan and the other Asian economies on the other. While Malaysia has succeeded in placing the EAEC on the Asean agenda, the idea has only so far had a lukewarm response from countries in the region. Apec is still considering whether the EAEC should form an integral part of the organisation. Japan has so far been non-committal: Tokyo wants to safeguard its estimated Dollars 33bn investments in the Asean economies, while not wanting to upset its already delicate trading relations with the US. Mrs Rafidah Aziz, Malaysia's fiery trade minister, will be in Seattle pushing Dr Mahathir's views. He has made it clear he will continue with his rival scheme for a grouping of east Asia's dynamic economies.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In its comment concerning subcoolers, Association of Home Appliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Manufacturers asserted that subcoolers are not used unless it is impossible to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> achieve the needed subcooling without them. The Association of Home Appliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Manufacturers also stated that when a subcooler is needed, the available room  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the chassis dictates the allowable length of the subcooler. (Association  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 12, 13). Whirlpool Corporation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stated that a subcooler type that transfers heat from the refrigerant in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> liquid line to the superheat exiting the evaporator is not practical in room  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> air conditioners due to limited space within the cabinet. (Whirlpool  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Corporation, No. 31 at 10).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department understands the conventional practice used by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturers for incorporating subcoolers into room air conditioners. But  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Department does not believe that this should prevent the design option  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from being considered. As long as the chassis of the particular unit is large  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enough to accommodate it, a subcooler will be considered as a way to improve a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unit's performance. Engineering data supplied by manufacturers provided  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information on the maximum length of subcoolers which could be incorporated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> into a particular unit. The data were used to establish subcooler length for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prospective room air conditioners.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Enhanced fin surfaces, such as wavy or slit patterns, improve the heat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transfer capability of a coil by increasing the air-side heat transfer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coefficient. In its comments regarding enhanced fin designs, the Association  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of Home Appliance Manufacturers stated that most manufacturers now use a wavy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or ``waffle'' fin (Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 12).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additional improvement can be achieved through the use of ``lanced'' or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``louvered'' fins. The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers expressed a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concern that data based on work performed by manufacturers should be more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> heavily relied upon than data based on published research papers available in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the public domain. The publicly available data seems to be either based upon  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> theoretical analysis or research-type testing of simulated coil  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> configurations. The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers stated that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the correlation between the data and actual performance results in room air  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditioners is difficult to determine. (Association of Home Appliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Manufacturers, No. 61A at 13, 14). Whirlpool Corporation stated that air flow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is reduced and air-side pressure drop across the coil is increased due to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incorporating enhanced fin surfaces into coils. But Whirlpool Corporation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> added that enhanced fin designs provide significant improvement without  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantial additional cost. (Whirlpool Corporation, No. 31 at 9).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department generally agrees with the comments made by Association of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Home Appliance Manufacturers concerning enhanced fin design. Test data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> received from room air conditioner manufacturers and heat exchanger  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturers are given more weight than theoretical analyses when deciding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> how much of an improvement should be given to the air-side heat transfer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coefficients due to enhanced fin surfaces. The Department does not believe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the theoretical or research data available in the public domain should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dismissed entirely, and is using it as a check on the data received from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturers to determine if their information is reasonable. Improvements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the air-side heat transfer coefficients are input to the computer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> simulation model. With this information on improvements, the model is able to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determine what effect enhanced fin surfaces have on the entire room air  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditioner system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Augmenting the smooth inside surface of refrigerant tubing with grooves  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increases the tube's refrigerant-side heat transfer coefficient. Grooved  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (rifled) tubing can therefore improve the heat transfer capability of a coil.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers' comments concerning grooved  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tubing are similar to the comments it gave regarding enhanced fin surfaces.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers stated that data based on work  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performed by manufacturers should be more heavily relied upon than data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided by refrigerant tubing manufacturers. The Association of Home  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appliance Manufacturers asserted that the data made available by tubing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturers are generally obtained under optimized conditions rather than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under conditions representing actual application in room air conditioners.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 15). Whirlpool  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Corporation states that grooved tubing costs significantly more than smooth  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tubing but has a beneficial effect on system performance. (Whirlpool  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Corporation, No. 31 at 9).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As with enhanced fin surface data, the Department is giving more weight  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to data received from room air conditioner manufacturers when deciding how  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> much improvement should be given to the refrigerant-side heat coefficients due  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to grooved tubing. The Department is using data made available by refrigerant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tubing manufacturers as well as data provided by research papers in the public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> domain to compliment the data received from room air conditioner  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturers. (See Technical Support Document, Volume H). Improvements to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the refrigerant-side heat transfer coefficients are input as multipliers to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the computer simulation model. With the multipliers, the model is able to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determine what effect grooved tubing has on the entire room air conditioner  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

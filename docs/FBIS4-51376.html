			<p>BFN     [Text] Yesterday was the fifth anniversary of the founding  of the militia unit dealing with contingencies in the provincial  capital Changsha. The unit staged report-back performances of  military training such as enemy-subduing boxing, skill in using  clubs, and unarmed combat to mark the anniversary. Established  to meet contingency needs with maintaining social stability and  protecting the people's peaceful labor as the guidelines, the  unit has made positive contributions to Changsha's reform and  opening up to the outside world.    In July last year, Changsha's urban and rural areas were  universally hit by floods and waterlogging. Over 1,000 dams,  mountain embankments, and reservoirs were in danger and 1  million mu of paddy fields was submerged. Ordered by the  Changsha Garrison Command, all militiamen of the unit pitched  into the work, guarding dams, plugging breaches, and rushing to  save the people's lives and property. They successively saved  more than 30,000 people who were marooned by flood waters and  over 700 tonnes of goods and materials.    The unit has also played the role of a shock force. This  year the unit has dispatched its members in more than 300,000  individual instances to take part in the construction of key  development projects such as the Xiang Jiang 100-li flood  control embankment and (Furong) Road, thus yielding impressive  economic results. The unit has also repeatedly made  contributions to maintaining social security.    Yesterday, provincial and city party, government, and Army  leaders [provincial Secretary] Wang Maolin, [provincial military  district Commander] Pang Weiqiang, (Wu Xiangdong), Shen Ruiting,  and Tang Zhixiang watched the unit's performances of military  training and reviewed the unit.</p>

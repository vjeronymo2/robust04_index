			<p><P> June 17, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. HOPES FOR PAPANDREOU DEFEAT -- BUT NOT OUT LOUD  </P> <P> The Bush Administration would dearly like to see Greece's Socialist government  voted out of office this Sunday -- but it's afraid to say so out loud.  </P> <P> "I shouldn't be telling you this," a State Department official said, assuming a  furtive look and dropping his voice -- "but we'd love to see Papandreou go."  </P> <P> Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou has been a thorn in Washington's side  ever since he was first elected eight years ago. He has campaigned against  Greece's membership in NATO, frequently charged U.S. interference in Greek  affairs and promised to deprive the United States of its military bases in his  country -- without ever quite following through.  </P> <P> Even worse, U.S. officials complain, Papandreou has turned Greece into a  virtual haven for Arab and European terrorists. For years, they charge, the  Greek prime minister accepted "substantial contributions" from Libyan leader  Moammar Kadafi -- and, in return, turned a blind eye to the operations of  Libyan agents in Greece.  </P> <P> Papandreou has denied the charge and U.S. officials say their intelligence  suggests that the payments from Kadafi have stopped.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Terror Suspect Released  </P> <P> Last year, Greece released a Palestinian who was wanted in Italy for a bloody  attack on a Rome synagogue in which a 2-year-old child was killed. Papandreou's  minister for justice contended that the man's actions had been part of "the  struggle to regain the independence of his homeland." Administration officials  accuse Athens of delaying the extradition of another Palestinian wanted in the  United States for the 1982 bombing of a Pan Am jet that killed one passenger.  </P> <P> Papandreou's opponent in the election, Constantine Mitsotakis, has promised to  shift Greece's foreign policy back toward the United States. Mitsotakis has  said he wants Greece to remain in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, wants  to keep U.S. bases in Greece and wants to crack down on terrorism.  </P> <P> Why, then, has the United States been so quiet about the election?  </P> <P> "We're afraid of tipping things the wrong way," said a Pentagon official. "Any  time you try to influence a foreign election, you usually create a backlash and  you end up with a net loss."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'He May Pull It Off'  </P> <P> Besides, said a State Department official, "Why alienate Papandreou? He may  pull it off."  </P> <P> If anything, the Administration has bent over backward to appear unruffled by  the prospect of another Papandreou government. President Bush appeared with the  Greek prime minister in a "photo opportunity" at the NATO summit in Brussels  last month; Papandreou used the photograph in his campaign to reassure centrist  voters that he wasn't so anti-American after all. And the State Department has  expressed confidence that relations with Greece are improving.  </P> <P> That hasn't stopped both sides in the Greek campaign from attacking the United  States occasionally. Papandreou has continued to campaign against "foreign  interference," which in Athens means Washington. Oddly enough, the opposition  has accused U.S. Ambassador Robert V. Keeley of trying secretly to help  Papandreou by telling a reporter that he was unimpressed by Mitsotakis; Keeley  has denied saying any such thing.  </P> <P> A recent poll showed Papandreou's Panhellenic Socialist Movement with only 36%  of the probable vote, well behind Mitsotakis's conservative New Democracy Party  with 47%.  </P> <P> But neither party may win a majority in Parliament, an outcome that could be  the most troublesome of all from the Administration's standpoint.  </P> <P> If both parties fall short of a majority, Papandreou could try to form a  coalition with the Greek Communist Party and other leftist groups -- giving  Greece a regime that could be the most leftist government ever seen within the  NATO alliance.  </P> <P> The resulting situation, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State M. James Wilkinson  recently told a congressional committee with some understatement, would be  "difficult."  </P></p>

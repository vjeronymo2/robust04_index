			<p><P> November 20, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN GETS 4-YEAR TERM IN B-1 CONTRACT FRAUD  </P> <P> A former Rockwell International supervisor was sentenced Monday in Los Angeles  to four years in prison for running a sham machine shop that received Rockwell  subcontracts for B1-B bomber parts.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge Terry Hatter imposed the sentence and a $12,000 fine on  Ralph Affinito, 49, of Rolling Hills Estates.  </P> <P> Affinito, a former Rockwell purchasing department supervisor, pleaded guilty in  July to three felonies in connection with the scheme.  </P> <P> Affinito's sham shop, Draw Industries, received 48 subcontracts worth more than  $430,000 from Rockwell's purchasing department beginning in 1982.  </P> <P> As a company supervisor, Affinito authorized Rockwell's approval of Draw as a  subcontractor and "systematically directed contracts to Draw by revealing  confidential bidding information to his partner (at Draw)," Assistant U.S.  Atty. John F. Walsh said.  </P> <P> Draw did no machine work for Rockwell. Its subcontracts on the B1-B bomber were  farmed out to other machine shops.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] New Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero said this  morning that public utility rates will be converted into URV's  [Real Value Units] by 15 April. He also said the date to put the  new currency, the real, into circulation has not been  established yet.    An agricultural harvest that may hit historical records,  high  foreign currency reserves, prices that are gradually being  converted into URV's at the pace the government expected, and  workers who received their first salaries converted into URV's  -- these are just a few of the signals of the economy that has a  new administrator as of today: Minister Rubens Ricupero.    Early today in the program Bom Dia Brasil, the minister said  in his first interview of the day he was sworn to in his post  that the current conditions are better than those of the former  economic plan.    In an exclusive interview, the minister said that in the  next  few days the government will convert public utility rates into  URV's, something that must be done before 15 April. According to  the minister, a date has not been established yet for putting  the new currency, the real, in circulation. Minister Ricupero  also said he will control government expenses. As for the  changes Congress might make in the provisional measure creating  the URV, Ricupero said he will not accept changes to the  economic plan such as the possible creation of a salary  readjustment trigger:    [Begin Ricupero recording] We must end the idea that it is  necessary to perpetuate inflation. We must eradicate inflation  once and for all and give the government a minimum period of  time to give it credit so as to allow the economic program to  demonstrate its advantages. [end recording]    Minister Ricupero was sworn in to his new post late this  morning during a simple ceremony in Planalto Palace. The  ceremony was held in the office of President Itamar Franco with  the presence of the ministers of the civilian and military  households and the environment, Henrique Cavalcanti; the  presidents of FIESP [Sao Paulo State Federation of Industries],  the CNI [National Confederation of Industries], and the Chamber  of Deputies; and former Finance Minister Fernando Henrique  Cardoso.

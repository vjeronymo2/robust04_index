			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Victor Cardoso] </F>   [Text] Jon Imanol Azua Mendia, government vice president of  the autonomous Basque country, confirmed that no known member of  the separatist organization ETA [Basque Fatherland and Liberty]  is in Mexico; that there is no known link with local subversive  groups; and that the Mexican Government has never asked for  special advisers to combat terrorist activities.    In a news conference at the conclusion of his eight-day  official visit to Mexico, the representative of the Basque  Government stated there is no information, proof, or indication  that the ETA had anything to do with the events that shook  Mexico this year. "If any known member of the ETA were in  Mexico, he would have been identified and completely controlled.  We have to admit, however, that clandestine organizations also  have unidentified leaders, but they are always tracked down," he  said.    He explained that the Mexican authorities and police  exchange  data with their counterparts in Spain and the Basque country,  which he considered normal and based on signed agreements. He  added that no specific action had been requested by the Mexican  Government.    Azua Mendia condemned violence and said dialogue is the best  path for finding solutions to any kind of problem. "There is no  place in any country for violence or the use of violent methods  because such things are insane and distort the main goals of any  struggle," he expressed.    Well versed in Mexican affairs as he has lived here for  several years, Azua Mendia made light of newspaper reports  implicating former Government Secretary Fernando Gutierrez  Barrios in illegal activities. He denied that Spanish media are  waging a campaign to discredit either Mexico or its politicians.  "I do not agree with the opinions expressed by much of the  media, although one could surmise that they are looking for the  reasons behind the events in the country. Nevertheless, they are  still nothing more than newspaper articles," he said.    "In general, there is confidence and a positive impression  of  Mexico abroad. Events throughout the year could have initially  shaken the confidence of the international community, but the  country's opening process, the signing of the free trade  agreement, and Mexico's recent inclusion in the OECD are proof  that this process is irreversible. All of these factors  increase confidence that Mexico is a sure bet for the future,"  Azua added.    Remarking on his visit, Azua Mendia said an agreement was  reached with Finance Secretary Pedro Aspe to operate a Basque  financial institution once the secretariat establishes the norms  for foreign bank operations in Mexico. Azua also spoke with  Foreign Secretary Manuel Tello, with whom he discussed relations  between Spain and Mexico, particularly trade and the  possibilities for foreign investment raised by NAFTA.</p>

			<p>931116 FT  16 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Uranium prices predicted to begin recovery within two years URANIUM PRICES, at present at their lowest-ever level in real terms, should start to recover in 18 months to two years, according to Mr Peter Wade, managing director of North Broken Hill Peko, the Australian resources group. He also suggests that, although demand for iron ore is likely to pick up and the volume of sales by Australian producers should increase in the coming year, there was still room for a further fall in prices for ore supplied to big Japanese customers. Discussing the uranium market at a meeting in London with the Association of Mining Analysts, Mr Wade pointed out that last year mines in the west and former eastern bloc countries provided only 65 per cent of the uranium consumed by western utilities - the material is used solely to produce nuclear energy - and the rest was drawn from stocks. 'At the rate stocks are being depleted, they run out in 18 months to two years,' he said. This calculation assumed that the Commonwealth of Independent States would continue to supply 100 per cent of its domestic market and 20 per cent of the western market. Free market uranium prices peaked at USDollars 45 a pound in 1978 when it seemed oil prices were going sky high, but they have been languishing below Dollars 10 for nearly five years. Over-optimistic predictions about nuclear power demand contributed to a build-up of stocks at the western utilities which brokers have been selling off. More recently, the brokers have also had access to excess stocks in the CIS. NBHP owns 66 per cent of Energy Resources of Australia, which operates the Ranger mine in the Northern Territory. Mr Wade that said prices well below production costs had forced ERA to cut back production to a level where it was servicing only those long-term supply contracts not related to the free market price. To fulfil its other contracts ERA had first bought uranium from brokers but more recently had signed a five-year supply contract with Kazakhstan. ERA was able to ship this uranium to US customers despite the present ban on CIS imports of the material because its contracts with American utilities pre-dated the ban. Mr Wade said the ban provided a clue to where uranium prices might be heading because the US government had said limited CIS imports would be permitted when the market price reached Dollars 13 a pound and all restrictions would be removed at Dollars 21. He said the upper limit was probably too high because prices between Dollars 16 and Dollars 18 a pound would encourage new uranium mines to come into production. Dealing with the iron ore negotiations, Mr Wade pointed out that NBHP was the fourth-largest iron ore producer in the world and had a Japanese partner, so it did not set the pace in the price negotiations with the Japanese. Nevertheless, he felt there was room for another price cut this year - but it would be 'a single digit' reduction, following last year's 13 per cent.</p>

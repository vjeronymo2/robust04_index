			<p><P> June 10, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIES TO TAPE  </P> <P> Lumiere (TNT Sunday at 7 p.m.): This 1976 film marked Jeanne Moreau's dazzling  debut as a writer-director. The drama focuses on a crucial year in the lives of  four actress friends (Lucia Bose, Francine Racette, Caroline Cartier and Moreau  herself). (2:15)  </P> <P> The Third Man (Disney Tuesday at 9 p.m.) is a witty, stylish, vastly  entertaining Carol Reed-Graham Greene 1949 film noir set in postwar Vienna.  </P> <P> Joseph Cotten, left, stars as a brash, naive American writer of Western novels  ensnared in danger and intrigue. Orson Welles, right, co-stars, of course, as  the slippery Harry Lime. (2:00)  </P> <P> The Gypsy Moths (TNT Wednesday at 5 p.m.): John Frankenheimer's sensitive 1969  film stars Burt Lancaster, Gene Hackman and Scott Wilson as barnstorming  skydivers who stir up a small Kansas town over a lazy Fourth of July weekend.  With Deborah Kerr. (2:25)  </P></p>

			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Lilly in the pink After yesterday's acquisition by Eli Lilly, drugs companies have spent Dollars 13bn (Pounds 8.5bn) buying their biggest customers. All the large pharmacy benefit managers - the middle-men who buy drugs on behalf of US healthcare providers - are now in the hands of manufacturers. While Lilly and SmithKline Beecham have followed the trail blazed by Merck, though, Glaxo has yet to make a move. The fall in its shares yesterday suggests some disappointment that Glaxo has not followed the herd into vertical integration. Yet it is not clear that Glaxo could justify the high prices paid by its peers. Lilly yesterday agreed to spend Dollars 4bn on a business with earnings of Dollars 30m. The sums only stack up if owning a benefit manager allows Lilly to increase sales of its leading drugs far faster than it could otherwise do. Since Lilly has a number of drugs with relatively low market shares in highly competitive areas of therapy, it may be able to achieve as much. SmithKline Beecham was in a similar position. Glaxo's dependence on Zantac, the anti-ulcer drug which is already market leader but whose future will be decided in the US courts, makes the benefits of vertical integration less clear cut. That is not to deny Glaxo's strategic weakness. The three biggest US benefit managers are now in the hands of companies which make competitors to Zantac. And Zantac still accounts for an uncomfortably large proportion of Glaxo's profits. An acquisition to widen its spread of products would be a way out of the group's strategic bind. Direct links with providers, such as healthcare management organisations or even hospital groups, cutting out the pharmacy benefit middlemen, might also do the trick.</p>

			<p><P> July 25, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DISCOVERY: APOLLO BOOK STORE  </P> <P> Rizzoli, it isn't.  </P> <P> There are no clearly delineated aisles, no bright signs telling people what  subject is in what row, no window display of new releases.  </P> <P> The books at Apollo Book Store in Costa Mesa are stacked on the floor with no  seeming rhyme or reason, magazines commingle with hardback books, and  newspapers are found in a variety of spots.  </P> <P> But there are many diamonds in the rough to be found, as Apollo keeps its  inventory up to date with rare and out-of-print books and first editions.  </P> <P> "We get a lot of browsers," said Mary-Alice Currie, who owns the store with her  husband, James L. (Lindy) Currie.  </P> <P> "Nautical books are our specialty, voyaging and things that pertain to the  ocean and the sea. We also have a lot of books on Western Americana. Come to  think of it, we have used books on every conceivable subject."  </P> <P> Back issues of general-interest magazines like Life are also available at the  store, as well as others covering a variety of topics, including cars, boating,  art and architecture.  </P> <P> The store has been at its same location on 18th Street for 29 years, but,  unfortunately, it won't see its 30th year there. Currie said they recently got  a notice to vacate the site. Their landlord plans to tear down the building  that houses Apollo and build anew.  </P> <P> "We will close sometime around mid-September," Currie said. "We're looking for  other sites, but if we don't find one soon we might become mail-order only."  </P> <P> With the impending closure, Apollo has stopped buying most used books and  magazines, with an eye toward moving its mammoth inventory.  </P> <P> Currie said there are "thousands, if not tens of thousands" of books, magazines  and newspapers in the store. "We don't keep a number on inventory."  </P> <P> The pricing system is based on the research they do on the availability of the  book or magazine, Currie said.  </P> <P> "Age is not necessarily the criterion we use," she said. "If there weren't very  many printed or a lot of things available on the particular subject it covers,  the price will be more."  </P> <P> Hardback books generally run in the $6 to $20 range, while magazines are a few  dollars less.  </P> <P> The store also sells Sunday editions of out-of-town newspapers from 18 U.S.  cities, Currie said.  </P> <P> "Most people buy them if they are planning to move soon, to scan the classified  ads, for housing and such," Currie said. "Seattle's (paper) has been a big  seller for a long time."  </P> <P> So if you're going to browse at Apollo, do it soon. There are only a handful of  diamond-hunting days left.  </P> <P> Hours: 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. Monday-Friday, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Saturday  </P> <P> Address: 545 W. 18th St., Costa Mesa  </P> <P> Telephone: (714) 646-7045  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 25, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TELEVISION AND REALITY  </P> <P> Was Mitroff poking fun at himself? His article asks why he, such an opponent of  TV, agrees to go on television to promote his book which is so critical of TV.  Who could resist -- attention, maybe fame, maybe even money! And television  benefits as well. It gains prestige, style, self-criticism.  </P> <P> And to topple irony with irony, the article appears on the very day that The  Times announces its new format, which makes reading the paper just as easy as  watching TV.  </P> <P> There's even a summary of Prof. Mitroff's article at the top -- just to make it  easier to read.  </P> <P> WILLIAM CUTTER  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

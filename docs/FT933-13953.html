			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Government plans wider access to information: Whistle-blowers may be protected by 'harm tests' MOVES TO sweep away of some of the secrecy of government came a step closer yesterday when Mr William Waldegrave, the public services minister, announced plans to increase public access to information. The plans include a code of practice, new statutory rights and the introduction of 'harm tests' to prevent whistle-blowers being penalised for revealing information that does no harm. Unveiling a white paper which outlines proposals designed to bring greater openness into Whitehall and other parts of the public sector, Mr Waldegrave said that public access to information would be restricted only where there were good reasons. Despite continuing pressure from opposition MPs and campaigners, he was unapologetic that the government had decided against a full freedom of information act. He insisted his proposals were practical steps which met the main aims of freedom of information legislation. They also maintained parliamentary accountability rather than handing the issue over to the courts. 'These proposals lay down a sure and lasting foundation for more open public administration and government,' he said. The proposals include a code of practice which would require Whitehall departments to comply with reasonable requests for information. This could extend to other organisations such as the National Health Service and local authorities. The code would be policed by the parliamentary ombudsman. There will be statutory rights to personal information and to health and safety information. There is unlikely to be time for government legislation in the coming session of parliament, but a backbench MP could sponsor the measures in the limited time available for this type of bill. Maintaining the momentum behind the plans will be a critical test of Mr Waldegrave's ability to sustain pressure on Whitehall. Some departments, said to include the Treasury and the department of health, have resisted aspects of the plans. Tory MPs said the plans had gone beyond their expectations, but opposition MPs and campaigners for greater freedom of information were more guarded in their welcome. Ms Marjorie Mowlam, the shadow public services minister, condemned the white paper as fundamentally flawed because it left ministers to decide what information should be made available. 'There are a lot of nice words, a lot of good intentions, a lot of rhetoric but in the end there is a deep failure to deliver open government,' she said.

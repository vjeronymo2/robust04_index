			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / GM loss of Dollars 4.5bn sets US record GENERAL MOTORS yesterday reported a 1991 loss of Dollars 4.5bn, (Pounds 2.57bn) the largest annual loss ever recorded by a US company. It also named a dozen plants which are to be closed and announced a shake-up of management structure designed to restore its North American operations to profit. The loss - below many analysts' expectations, which ranged as high as Dollars 5bn to Dollars 6bn - included a Dollars 1.8bn after-tax charge, taken in the fourth quarter, to cover a significant restructuring plan announced by the company last December. This involves the closure of 21 plants and a 74,000 reduction in GM's workforce by the mid-1990s, mainly through attrition and early retirement. Yesterday GM ended two months of uncertainty by adding 12 new plant names to the two it previously announced would be closed. They include two car assembly plants, in Ypsilanti, Michigan, and North Tarrytown, New York, employing a total of 7,470. An engine plant in Flint, Michigan, employing 4,036 will also be closed. GM, the world's largest motor manufacturer, has been hit hard by the US recession, which has sharply cut demand for cars at a time when growing production in the US by Japanese rivals has created excess demand. The company said it had a fourth-quarter net loss of Dollars 2.47bn, or Dollars 4.25 a share, on sales of Dollars 30.4bn, after the special charge. This compared with a loss of Dollars 1.6bn, or Dollars 2.89, on revenues of Dollars 26.4bn in 1990. Mr Robert Stempel, chairman, said the fourth-quarter Dollars 520m operating loss represented a significant improvement over the previous four quarters, and this was due partly to cost-cutting efforts. 'We are committed to substantially resizing GM's North American operations to achieve full competitiveness as quickly as possible,' Mr Stempel added. 'I expect GM's quarterly earnings to improve into 1992.' In spite of his remarks, GM shares sunk in trading on Wall Street to close at Dollars 37 3/4 , down Dollars  5/8 on the day. The company's Dollars 4.5bn full-year loss broke the US record for annual red ink set in 1987 by Texaco, the oil company, which reported a Dollars 4.1bn loss. The GM figures compared with the group's losses of Dollars 2bn in 1990, when it took a Dollars 2.1bn after-tax charge for plant closings.</p>

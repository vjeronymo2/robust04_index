			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Money Markets: Bundesbank holds fire THIS WEEK'S key economic releases and speculation about interest rate moves at the UK Budget time drove the money market yesterday, writes Rachel Johnson. After Wednesday's encouragingly low inflation numbers, those hoping for an interest rate cut in the Budget on November 30 took strength in the money supply figures - which showed weak demand for credit across both the personal and corporate sectors. At its regular fortnightly council meeting, the Bundes-bank did not change either its Lombard or discount rates but did pare another four basis points off the repo rate. Next week's two-week rate will be fixed at 6.25 per cent. This prompted some speculation in Paris of a 15 to 20 basis points trim in the French intervention rate over coming weeks - possibly ahead of an official cut in German rates. In London, however, the three-month interbank rate for sterling remained unchanged at 5 1/2 per cent from the previous day's close. This rate reflected mixed sentiment in the market following an unexpectedly sharp drop in UK unemployment and well-founded caution about the chancellor's next move. Short sterling was almost unaltered on the day - the March con-tract closed steady at about 94.79. 'The latest figures have been conducive for a rate easing, but we have had our fingers burnt predicting Kenneth Clarke before,' said one trader. Also impelling caution were yesterday's labour market figures, which left analysts wondering as to the real direction of the recovery after poor retail sales figures earlier in the week. The surprising 49,000 fall in unemployment last month to 2.85m suggests that the jobless total is now on a downward trend - but the figures have been erratic since the falls first started occurring in February. The sterling yield curve still reflects expectation that the chancellor will lower rates by  1/2 percentage point in the Budget and by the same amount in April. The Bank of England's operations were routine. It predicted a fairly large liquidity shortage of Pounds 1.7bn (later revised upwards to Pounds 1.8bn) in the morning, which it fully relieved during the day. Elsewhere, the Central Bank of Norway cut its overnight lending rate to 6.75 per cent from 7 per cent.</p>

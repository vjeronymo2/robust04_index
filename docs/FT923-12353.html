			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / Industry backs Major's stance on ERM LEADERS of British industry yesterday backed the UK's continuing membership of the European exchange rate mechanism but urged the government to seek early cuts in domestic interest rates. Senior executives in industrial and commercial companies expressed widespread support in a straw poll for Mr Major's campaign to restrict inflation, in spite of concern over the impact of high interest rates on their businesses. Many agreed with Mr Norman Lamont, chancellor of the exchequer, that there were no 'short-term fixes'. But directors in hard-pressed industries such as housebuilding, which is sensitive to mortgage interest rates, want the chancellor to start shaving interest rates immediately in order to test the pound's resilience in foreign exchange markets. The Confederation of British Industry has been frustrated by recent ministerial reluctance to pursue a 'step-by-step' reduction in interest rates. It believes further reductions are essential if the economy is to revive and that small cuts could be accommodated without jeopardising sterling's position within the ERM. Mr Neville Simms, chief executive of Tarmac, Britain's biggest housebuilder, said: 'The government's policy of driving down inflation is eminently sensible but there must be a level of pain beyond which that sensible objective becomes counter-productive. I feel we are now entering that phase.' Sir Lawrie Barratt, chairman of housebuilder Barratt Developments, appealed to Mr Lamont to cut interest rates, abolish stamp duty on house sales and double the threshold for mortgage tax relief from Pounds 30,000 to Pounds 60,000. Mr John Towers, group managing director of Rover Group, the UK's largest carmaker with an annual output of nearly 500,000 vehicles, said companies that would prefer higher inflation to the current lack of demand were misguided. He said: 'There are short-term fixes. You could have a significant expansion of public spending, cut interest rates and revalue the pound. The trouble with each of them is that, while they would get the economy going, they would take us back into inflation.' He compared the difficulty of fine tuning the economy with flying a helicopter: 'You move the controls and nothing seems to happen for a bit, so you move them some more and then it overreacts.' Mr Martin Taylor, chief executive of Courtaulds Textiles, said concentration by ministers on the retail price index as a measure of inflation had underestimated the depth of recession. He said: 'A general realignment of ERM parities is necessary. The chancellor said last week that this was not on the agenda but I think it ought to be.' Mr Mark Souhami, deputy chairman of Dixons, the electrical retailing group, said: 'There is no case for coming out of the ERM or for devaluing within the ERM. It is unthinkable that you can go into the ERM one year and come out of it another just because the medicine is doing what it is supposed to do.' Mr Michael Garner, finance director at specialist engineering company TI, said: 'We have had two years of pain (within the ERM). But there is little choice other than to persevere.' Among those arguing that the government should change its approach was Mr Edwin Black, sales manager at M and G Cars, a car dealer in Cookstown, Northern Ireland. He said: 'There's a lot of us not making a living any more. The government has to listen to people and do something to revive the economy.' Should Britain leave the ERM? Page 7</p>

			<p><P> September 20, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CLUES SOUGHT IN DISAPPEARANCE OF VISTA BOY, 12  </P> <P> Sheriff's Department investigators are baffled by the disappearance of a  12-year-old Vista boy who has been missing for more than two weeks.  </P> <P> "We're unable to explain his disappearance and we have no leads as to his  current whereabouts," Sgt. Glenn Revell said.  </P> <P> Aaron Noe Ortega-Cervantes has been missing since Sept. 4 and investigators  don't know if he was abducted or went to Tijuana where his father lives, Revell  said.  </P> <P> Aaron, who is called Noe by his family, is about 4 feet tall, weighs 85 pounds,  and has black hair and brown eyes. He also has a small scar over his right eye  and a scar on his right temple. He was last seen wearing a blue T-shirt, pink  shorts and white tennis shoes.  </P> <P> On Sept. 4, the day he disappeared, investigators discovered that Aaron didn't  show up for class at Lincoln Middle School in the 100 block of Escondido Avenue  as he had promised his mother.  </P> <P> Aaron had been shy about going to school because he speaks only Spanish, Revell  said.  </P> <P> Investigators think Aaron spent the day in a nearby park before returning home  at 3:30 p.m., when he left the house again to go out and play.  </P> <P> There has been an unconfirmed sighting of Aaron later that afternoon on  Escondido Avenue just south of the school, Revell said.  </P> <P> He was apparently walking behind a woman about 30 years old who was carrying a  baby and walking with another boy who was about 6 years old.  </P> <P> Aaron and his mother had been living near other relatives in a Vista  neighborhood for about three months, Revell said.  </P> <P> "It is unusual to us that this child would leave. One of the complaints in the  past was that he missed his cousins," Revell said.  </P> <P> Some family members have gone back to Tijuana to find the boy's father.  </P> <P> Anyone with information is asked to call the Sheriff's Department at 940-4547  or Crime Stoppers at 235-TIPS.  </P></p>

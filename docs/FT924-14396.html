			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / Banks refuse to offer Jubilee Line cash CANARY WHARF's bankers refused yesterday to make a no-strings offer of cash to build the extension to London Underground's Jubilee Line, making it almost inevitable that the project will not go ahead. The 11 banks, which met yesterday, had already made an offer of Pounds 390m conditional on civil servants moving to Canary Wharf, the failed development in London's Docklands. The government does not regard that as a proper offer under the terms it laid down earlier this year. A government adviser said: 'I do not understand why the Canary Wharf administrators have been claiming that the banks made an offer of funds for the line, because they really had not.' The government has said that the extension would go ahead only if the private sector contributed Pounds 400m to the Pounds 1.6bn cost. Under the terms, that contribution must not depend on any form of government support, such as rent from a ministry. The bankers had been hoping that the Department of the Environment would relocate its main office to Canary Wharf. The department is now likely to move its civil servants to empty government buildings in Whitehall. 'It would have been utterly uncommercial of us to remove the condition of the civil servants moving to Canary Wharf,' a banker said. However, Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, insisted yesterday that no decision had yet been taken on the department's relocation, and emphasised again that the judgment would be made on the basis of value for money. If the Tube extension is abandoned, the administrators of Canary Wharf will have enormous difficulty in finding tenants for the Pounds 1.5bn development, the bankers said. One option, one of the bankers said, would be to mothball most of the 15 buildings until the property market recovered. London Regional Transport is making a last-ditch attempt to save the Jubilee Line extension. It has commissioned a study from London Economics, the research group, on the net costs of the line to the government, taking account of indirect and direct tax revenues generated by the construction project and social security savings. It estimates the net costs at Pounds 972m, even without a contribution from the private sector. However, the Treasury is understood to be unimpressed by the argument.</p>

			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Hartstone Pounds 71m in the red and calls for Pounds 30m Hartstone, the struggling hosiery and handbags group, yesterday launched a Pounds 30.3m rescue rights issue, after revealing a pre-tax loss of Pounds 70.7m for the year ended March 31. The rights issue was long expected, as Hartstone had committed to repay Pounds 15m to its principal creditors by October, but the stock market reacted badly to the level of discount for the new shares. Hartstone's shares closed 10p lower at 22p. The company's problems stemmed from its aggressive expansion into Europe just before the recession set in. It purchased 20 companies in a four year period, but failed to establish adequate financing and management controls. Hartstone has been forced into a programme of asset disposals, under Mr Shaun Dowling, chairman, who was appointed in May 1993 to keep the company afloat. The rights issue is designed to shore up the group's tattered balance sheet, reducing its gearing levels to within the permitted maximum level under its articles of association, and pay down its principal debt. Mr Dowling said: 'The rights issue will put the group on a stronger financial footing for the future and will allow the team to devote its attention to the development of the group's core businesses'. This is primarily its leatherware business. Hartstone is offering 215.6m new shares at 15p on a 2-for-1 basis. The issue is fully underwritten by Schroders. Of the Pounds 30.3m proceeds, Pounds 15m will be repaid to creditors, and Pounds 13.1m will provide working capital. Charterhouse Bank has an option to utilise Pounds 2.2m of a term loan to subscribe for rights shares. At the year end, the company had net borrowings of Pounds 62.6m with 23 banks. This was substantially below the 1993 level, but due to the write-down of assets gearing increased to 310 per cent. After the rights issue, gearing will fall to 63 per cent, with net debt of Pounds 31.8m. Hartstone remained profitable at the operating level last year, and its problems stemmed from its disposal programme and the extent of its restructuring. Turnover from continuing businesses rose by 6.5 per cent to Pounds 239.4m, although total turnover fell to Pounds 363.9m (Pounds 370.3m). The group's core businesses of Etienne Aigner and Michael Stevens in its leatherware division and Spanish hosiery subsidiary Aznar all remained highly profitable, and total operating profit before extraordinary items and interest amounted to Pounds 11.7m (Pounds 16.7m). Last time there was a pre-tax loss of Pounds 9.86m. Hartstone paid Pounds 10.9m (Pounds 7.9m) of interest. Exceptional losses came to Pounds 71.5m (Pounds 18.7m), of which Pounds 50.9m represented the write-off of goodwill after disposals. The company is proposing to pay a final dividend of 0.32p for the year to March 1995, but it will not pay a dividend for 1993-94. Losses per share amounted to 68.2p (12.4p).</p>

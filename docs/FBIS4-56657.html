			<p>BFN     [Text] Politburo members Carlos Lage, Jose Ramon Machado  Ventura, and Ricardo Alarcon chaired a recent meeting with  presidents of Administrative Councils where they analyzed the  budget, self-employment, the local industry, and the illegal  sale of vehicles and homes.    With regard to the national budget, it was determined that  it  has presented positive signs during the first two months of the  year. Holguin was the only province to register an improvement  in its own income.    The analysis on self-employment established that some  craftsmen employ other people in their production, using energy  and raw material of doubtful origin. It was also mentioned that  in many cases it is not a craft activity, but rather an  industrial activity. With the purpose of detecting any  undercover illegality, the participants at the meeting agreed to  review all licenses granted those calling themselves craftsmen.    Another important point of the discussion was the sale of  vehicles received as incentives and the illegal buying and  selling of homes. The analysis determined that intellectuals,  laborers, cadres, and public officials have been involved in  buying and selling cars and motorcycles. It was recalled that  the state has a legal and moral right to appropriate these goods  because their owners signed and accepted a contract stipulating  that the state has preference over the vehicle when the owner no  longer has use for it.    Regarding houses, its was also pointed out that the existing  law, which states that the right to own real estate must not  become a mechanism of gain or exploitation, is being violated.  It was explained that rigorous action will be taken in the event  of these illegal acts and that sanctions will be extended  indefinitely and constantly reviewed to prevent future  occurrences.</p>

			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Accountancy Column: Hedging their bets for a more diversified future - A look at a surprising development in the world of accountancy and wonders what the consequences may be IT BEGAN with a random telephone call early in the morning. It ended as one of the most significant accountancy stories of the year. Today the Financial Times can reveal an astonishing tale in the development of professional practice. An anonymous tipster first revealed the intriguing activities afoot in Birmingham. 'A lot of accountants seem to be to going in and out of the office of Safe Bet, the betting shop chain,' said the croaky voice at the other end of the line, before slamming down the receiver without the chance for cross-examination. At first, the most logical implication seemed to be that one of the more illustrious regional firms of bookies was about to go into receivership. A train journey and some confrontational questioning proved that the truth was far more shocking. 'Er, we were hoping to give this as an exclusive to the Racing Times,' said Mr John Strate-Lace, senior partner of Honest &amp; John, the accountants, when confronted. 'We are about to make a big announcement.' We were sitting in the back room of a large betting shop, our voices almost drowned by the results of the 3.30 at Newmarket. What had happened was a merger between Honest &amp; John, one of the UK's better-known local firms of number crunchers, and Safe Bet, a rather more racy outfit altogether, which specialised in making a living from betting. 'The idea first came to me when I was walking into, er, past one of the branches a few months ago,' said Strate-Lace. 'They called themselves turf accountants and bookmakers. We were chartered accountants and bookkeepers. The link seemed so profitable, er, I mean logical,' he explained. To an outsider, it seemed a rather unorthodox combination. But the firm was unrepentant. 'Why not?' said Mr John Wyde-Boi, managing partner. 'Everyone else is diversifying. We must survive and respond to our customers' needs as flexibly as possible. This is a valuable new form of strategic alliance.' His argument had some credence. In the last few months, both Ernst &amp; Young and Price Waterhouse have hired politicians to work in their consultancy divisions. Coopers &amp; Lybrand brought in a treasury management specialist. KPMG Peat Marwick has hired a merchant banker in its corporate finance division, to add to its growing ranks of actuaries and those from other professions. Most of the large firms are involved in an increasingly diverse range of services: executive recruitment, management buy-outs, relocation, environmental consulting, corporate strategy. But betting? That seemed to be carrying things a little too far. Mr 'Brown' Tweed, owner of Safe Bet, disagreed. 'Betting has a long and distinguished history. Arguably it's the oldest business activity in the world. It started centuries before double-entry bookkeeper was even a twinkle in a medieval monk's eye. And think of the notable people who indulge.' 'Robert Maxwell?' I ventured, knowing the tycoon's penchant for an occasional but extravagant flutter on the roulette wheel. 'Well, maybe he's not such a good example,' he said. 'But what right do we have to turn a customer away? After all, the accountancy firms were happy to work for Maxwell for years.' 'We don't see any contradiction between our businesses,' added Strate-Lace. 'This is a competitive world. Our clients expect us to be able to service all their needs. There is an obvious synergy with betting. We saw clear mutual advantages and are delighted with the results.' His argument focused around three key points. First, Safe Bet would provide an ideal way to spread the operations of Honest &amp; John geographically, taking advantage of Safe Bet's 25 outlets across the West Midlands. Second, it would fulfil the apparently widespread needs of business and personal clients to indulge in an occasional flutter. Finally, it would lead to the development of new products. The accountancy partners and senior betting staff were working together to develop a range of alternative methods of finance and currency hedging from horse-racing, not to mention new personal financial products. Clients would be charged a proportion of the winnings as a contingency fee. If the bets lost, they would be billed at modest hourly rates. 'Brown's understanding of probabilities might even lead to us being able to develop a revolutionary new and effective technique for audit sampling which would allow us to detect fraud,' said Strate-Lace excitedly. 'Frankly if litigation against accountants by disgruntled investors is going to become a crap shoot, we may as well at least be prepared.' At the very least, it opened up a range of new betting activities. 'We're devising new books on voting for the deputy president of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, and on the likelihood of future mergers between accounting firms,' said Tweed. 'We've even got one on the prospect for litigation reform to reduce the damage to accountants of being sued. But that's for real gamblers. The odds are much longer.' There were many other little benefits. The new software packages designed by the accountancy firm's information technology unit would provide an unparalleled way to store and retrieve data on horse probabilities, for instance, and their knowledge of Monte Carlo simulations help make stronger predictions. The bookie's expertise would boost the partners' ability to predict changes in forthcoming budgets. The merger - which both sides stressed was taking place on equal terms - will lead to a new firm called Honest &amp; John. Each office of either business will in future combine both functions. That will give the betting shops access to some of the more respectable high street locations. It will also ensure that even during the recession, when the accountants are less busy, the premises will be in use for longer hours at the weekends by punters. 'It will be a useful way to save us from having to fire our graduate recruits while we have relatively little accounting work for them to do at the moment,' confided Mr Wyde-Boi. 'We will second them into the betting operations.' While the larger accountancy firms could afford to send managers on Outward Bound courses to test their suitability for partnership, Honest &amp; John would put theirs out to stadia around the country on weekends as Safe Bet field representatives. There would also be scope for partners to spend periods in the betting shops. 'We are great believers in our profession's ethical rules which call for regular partner rotation,' said Wyde-Boi. 'It gives them a fresh perspective and keeps them independent.' 'Frankly, the one thing that concerns me is the way these accountants dress,' said Tweed, brushing cigarette ash from his dog-check jacket and pushing his hat further back on his head with a quick poke of the finger on the rim. 'Grey suits will have to be banned from public view.' I called the Institute of Chartered Accountants to see whether they approved of this unusual development in the activities of the profession. But an official said that nothing in the by-laws or ethical guidelines precluded mergers with betting shops. Honest &amp; John could continue to be called chartered accountants as long as at least a quarter of its partners were qualified. If the punters start to complain, it's a safe bet they will have to act on the matter soon.</p>

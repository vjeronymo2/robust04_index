Khetagurov made the statement Sunday addressing a news  conference in Vladikavkaz.    The statement was caused by the article in the  MEGAPOLIS-EXPRESS weekly, which says about the the North  Ossetian prime minister's complicity to Polyanichko's  assassination. Khetagurov characterized the publication as an  outrageous statement which deliberately appeared during the  election campaign in North Ossetia and Khetagurov stands for  presidency.    The statement by the MEGAPOLIS-EXPRESS weekly was denied at  the news conference in Vladikavkaz by a senior official of the  criminal department at the Russian Interior Ministry, Lieutenant  General Vladimir Kolesnichenko.</p>

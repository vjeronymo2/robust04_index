			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by military correspondent Eytan Rabin] </F>   [Excerpts] Major General Yitzhaq Mordekhay, commander of  the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] Northern Command, said yesterday  that he believes the terrorists will try to step up their  attacks in southern Lebanon in anticipation of the  Clinton-al-Asad summit in Geneva on 16 January.    According to Maj. Gen. Mordekhay, before such summits there  is always an escalation in Hizballah activities and attempts to  cause unrest in the area.    Senior military sources in the Northern Command assessed  that  the rejectionist front organizations will also attempt to step  up attacks against the IDF and SLA [South Lebanese Army] in the  security zone in the week ahead. The IDF is consequently  raising its level of alert in southern Lebanon. [passage  omitted]    According to Maj. Gen. Mordekhay, Syria must curb the terror  activity: "Just as Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has said, Syria  wields the decisive influence over Hizballah. The most  important thing the prime minister and the chief of staff have  said is that if Syria makes a real effort, it can curtail  terrorism along our northern border." [passage omitted]    According to Gen. Mordekhay, Hizballah has started firing  from villages north of the security zone over the past few  weeks, in violation of the understandings reached in the wake of  Operation Accountability.    According to Mordekhay, "during 1993, 124 terrorists were  killed and dozens of others were wounded, Operation  Accountability included. Our forces in the north are attaining  their objectives. I believe the northern border settlements  enjoy a high level of security thanks to IDF activity in the  security zone and along the international border."</p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Moscow Ostankino Television First  Channel Network in Russian at 2032 GMT on 3 March broadcasts a  10-minute program entitled "Russia and Uzbekistan: A Path Toward  Trust." The program contains an interview with Uzbekistan's  President Islam Karimov by Ostankino Television correspondent  Farid Seyful-Mulyukov. The interview was recorded after  President Karimov had concluded his official visit to Moscow and  is on the results of his visit, his talks with President  Yeltsin, and the general situation in the CIS.    President Karimov begins by saying: "I am satisfied with the  results of the talks and conversations we had with President  Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin, Prime Minister Viktor Stepanovich  Chernomyrdin, members of the government, statesmen, and public  representatives." He continues: "I would like to draw the main  conclusion on the results of my visit: Relations between Russia  and Uzbekistan are entering an entirely new stage and are  reaching an entirely new level. I would like to stress again  that in some way it is a prototype of the relations Russia  intends to have with the countries within the CIS and, thus, to  give an entirely new impetus to the content of the Commonwealth  in general. "In this regard, the interests of both Russia  and Uzbekistan coincide. We do not imagine our future without  Russia. I state this authoritatively. I am convinced that  Russia's interests in Central and Middle Asia and Uzbekistan  coincide with the policy we pursue, and I am convinced that  Russia is interested in having Uzbekistan as its reliable  long-term partner and ally in the Central Asian region."    Karimov says that Russia is a great superpower, and as such,  Russia has interests beyond its territory. In his opinion,  Russia -- like any other superpower -- should protect its  interests and state them loud and clear. He stresses that here  "the main point is that there should be no imperial ambitions on  the part of Russia, and that Russia's interests should coincide  with the interests of the countries and states, which have  become sovereign and independent today."    He continues: "Then the foundation is laid for normal,  equal,  and mutually advantageous long-term reliable relations between  these states." Karimov reiterates that Uzbekistan is interested  in having such a reliable partner as Russia, and stresses that  Russia should be a guarantor of stability and peace in the  Central Asian region.    To a question about the exacerbated situation on the  Tajik-Afghan border and measures to stabilize it, Karimov says:  "The border between Tajikistan and Afghanistan is not merely a  border between these two states, it is the CIS border; it is the  border of Russia, Uzbekistan, and all other states in this  region," and everyone is interested in peace and stability in  Tajikistan. "There are no effectual borders between Tajikistan  and Uzbekistan, and everything taking place in Tajikistan today  will affect Uzbekistan tomorrow without fail," President Karimov  stresses. He adds that the states that are parties to the  treaty on collective security have clearly stated that their  interests in the border between Afghanistan and Tajikistan are  unshakeable, "and we will do everything possible to protect  these borders as our own."    Touching on the issue of reforms, Karimov explains that the  purpose of reforms in Uzbekistan coincides with the purpose of  reforms in Russia. Uzbekistan is in favour of a market economy.  He stresses that both Russia and Uzbekistan are countries of  the east and have specific features which have to be taken into  account. These features are connected to their historic past,  national peculiarities, and to the mentality of the people. He  warns that "Russia is no Poland, or any republic where any  experiments can be performed," and stresses that people should  come first, because reforms are not implemented for reforms'  sake, but for the sake of the people.    On the prospects for the Commonwealth, Karimov says that  political independence and sovereignty are not economic notions.  In his opinion, political independence should be based on  economic categories. "Our first principle is the priority of  the economy over politics and a complete removal of ideology  from the economy. Having built the economic basis of our  society, we can speak about sovereignty and independence,"  Karimov states. He says that the Commonwealth is what was  needed after the disintegration of the Union. "If there had not  been a Commonwealth, we would have probably had a scenario  similar to the Yugoslav one on the territory of the former  Union. I have grounds for saying this. In this respect, during  this time the Commonwealth has undergone certain changes and  transformations. Today all the member states of the  Commonwealth realize that our future lies in a closer knit  Commonwealth, and we should give this Commonwealth specific  forms and a specific face. The Commonwealth should work toward  common goals as well as toward the interests of every state that  joins this Commonwealth." Karimov says that today the  Commonwealth has new goals and that everyone is convinced that  "we should see our future in strengthening the Commonwealth.  Russia is interested in us, and, of course, we see that our  future lies together with Russia. What we signed today and  yesterday is evidently the prototype of what Russia will have  with all the CIS states, and this will ensure that our relations  with Russia are equal, mutually advantageous, long-term, and  most reliable in terms of partnership," President Karimov  concludes.</p>

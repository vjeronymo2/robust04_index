			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by President Ion Iliescu at dinner in honor of </F> Franjo Tudjman, president of the Republic of Croatia, in  Bucharest on 14 February -- recorded]    [Text] Mr. President Franjo Tudjman, esteemed guests:    I take this opportunity to express again my great pleasure  of  welcoming you to Romania. I recall with satisfaction my visit  to the Republic of Croatia in the spring of 1993 and the  understandings and agreements concluded on that occasion. Those  agreements have inaugurated an important stage in the  development of bilateral relations and facilitated a better  knowledge of our cooperation possibilities and of the stands  promoted by our countries in connection with various  international matters, particularly with regard to the efforts  to find a political solution to put an end to the conflict in  the area of former Yugoslavia.    Mr. President, your visit to Romania opens new prospects for  the development of cooperation between our countries and for the  implementation of the political desire expressed by both sides  to promote a fruitful long-term cooperation. The Treaty of  Friendship and Cooperation that we will sign as well as the  other cooperation accords that will be finalized during your  current visit are proof of this will of our two countries and  also create the necessary premises for the implementation of  this will. We are close countries, situated in the same region.  Consequently, we are objectively interested in developing ever  more substantial ties in the political, economic, and cultural  fields.    Mr. President, the situation in the region is a handicap for  the establishment of normal relations at the bilateral or  multilateral level. The armed conflict, the immense loss of  human lives, the huge material destruction, and the drama of the  refugees represent an unacceptable situation vis-a-vis the  aspirations for peace, better life, and democracy which have  animated the nations in this part of Europe after the  liquidation of the totalitarian communist system.    Both of us are fully experiencing the effects of the  embargo,  at a time when our economies, which are in a period of  transition, are least prepared to support them, particularly  since there are no compensations. But then, we do not expect  anyone to compensate us for our huge economic losses incurred as  a result of the observation of the sanctions imposed by the  United Nations. The best compensation for us is a speedy  normalization of the situation in the former Yugoslav area. The  deadlocked peace negotiations, the risk of possible air strikes  in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the latest trend toward further  escalation confirm the imperious need for all parties involved  to renounce all confrontation, to end the fighting and military  actions, and to show maximum responsibility with a view to  finding a political solution to the conflict.    Even before the start of the armed conflict, Romania spoke  out for a political solution to the Yugoslav crisis. We are  convinced that no effort should be spared to end the armed  confrontations and agree on some appropriate settlements, which  should reflect and observe the interests of all sides involved.  In this spirit, we welcomed the recent accord between Croatia  and FRY, as an important and essential step toward a political  solution, as well as the recent tentative moves toward easing  tension in Sarajevo, which can facilitate an understanding  between the three sides on a political solution regarding the  future of Bosnia-Herzegovina.    We are convinced that, thanks to the ties of friendship and  cooperation which Romania maintains with all the successor  states of former Yugoslavia, we are making a contribution --  alongside of the efforts of the international community -- to  restoring stability and a climate of trust among these states  and ensuring security and peace in this part of Europe, where we  are living. In this peaceful endeavor, no effort is futile.    Allow me to raise my glass to the development of Romanian-  Croatian relations and to the well-being and peace of our two  nations. To your health, Mr. President, and to the health of  the distinguished guests.</p>

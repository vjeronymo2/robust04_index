			<p>BFN     [Text] Freedom Front leader Constand Viljoen questioned the  establishment of the truth commission. General Viljoen said he  did not believe that the commission would help with  reconciliation and that its findings would negatively influence  the public. Turning to the granting of amnesty, he said a case  could be made concerning the extension of the amnesty date to  May the 10th, the date of President Mandela's inauguration.</p>

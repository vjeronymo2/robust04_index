			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: 'Spendthrift' solicitors MY MOTHER left me some property: two old cottages and a piece of land. The solicitors have now whittled away the little money she had, engaging surveyors etc to plot the properties on maps. The solicitors now say the surveyors must be brought in to give an estimate of the properties for inheritance tax and capital gains tax. This is going to cost Pounds 300-Pounds 400. Is this really necessary in law? Can I demand the cash that is left before they think of some way to spend it? It is not absolutely necessary for a professional valuation to be obtained in respect of the property but it is often helpful. The property is likely to be valued by the District Valuer of the Inland Revenue and you might be happy with the valuation obtained. But if you are able to provide a value, supported by a third-party surveyor, then this could help your case. It is a case of weighing up the likely cost of the valuation against the potential benefit to be obtained. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

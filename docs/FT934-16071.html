			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / Teachers oppose truancy tables THE National Association of Head Teachers yesterday urged Mr John Patten, the education secretary, to change his plans for publishing truancy league tables for schools next month. Mr David Hart, the association's general secretary, described the proposed tables as 'dangerously false' because they would be based on how many pupils had missed at least one half-day of school, rather than on the total amount of days missed through truancy. He said the former figure would produce 'such extreme variations in the published data as to make it meaningless'. Mr Hart added that many truancies lasting for only a half-day were parentally condoned, and that this could distort the figures for school comparisons, leaving 'a very real prospect of government policy in this area being exposed to ridicule'. Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary, said the association's complaints, made in a letter to Mr Patten, provided 'alarming evidence of the consequences of government by gimmick'.</p>

They concentrated on their quarterback,  Todd Marinovich, elevating him from a good sophomore quarterback to the point  of being a Heisman Trophy candidate.  </P> <P> It's too bad equally or more qualified Pac-10 quarterbacks such as Brad Gossen  of Washington State, Bill Musgrave of Oregon and Paul Justin of Arizona State  don't attend schools with the same promotional skills.  </P> <P> ROGER GLAZBROOK  </P> <P> Glendora  </P></p>

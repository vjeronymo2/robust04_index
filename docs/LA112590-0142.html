			<p><P> November 25, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CHAPMAN DOUBLETREE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT;  </P> <P> CHAPMAN COMPENSATES FOR TURNOVERS TO WIN TITLE  </P> <P> Sixteen first-half turnovers didn't bother Chapman College Coach Bob Boyd  Saturday night in the championship game of the Chapman/Doubletree Basketball  Classic.  </P> <P> That's because Chapman's defense held Grand Canyon (2-1) to 25 first-half  points on 35% shooting, and the Panthers (4-0) survived a second-half Grand  Canyon rally for a 77-69 victory.  </P> <P> "It seems there is a trade-off with the turnovers and the shots we get," Boyd  said. "We may throw some passes away under pressure, but we'll get a lot more  chances to slam it in the goal."  </P> <P> Chapman center Roger Middleton did much of that for Boyd, scoring the majority  of his team-high 22 points from inside.  </P> <P> Andre Hill, the tournament Most Valuable Player, handled Chapman's outside  scoring, making three of four three-point shots and finishing with 19 points.  </P> <P> Chapman made 57% of its field goals but still needed some clutch free-throw  shooting to hold off Grand Canyon.  </P> <P> The Panthers made 22 of 28 free throws from the line, including sixth man Chuck  McGavran's six of six in the final three minutes.  </P> <P> "I'm happy with the win, because I think we beat a pretty good team," Boyd  said, "and although Grand Canyon disrupted us at times, we adjusted well to  their changing defenses."  </P> <P> Chapman's Frantz Reyes, who earned all-tournament honors along with Middleton  and Hill, finished with 15 points. Eric Taylor led Grand Canyon with 17 points,  16 in the second half.  </P> <P> In the tournament consolation game:  </P> <P> Southern California College 98, Seattle 85 -- SCC's Mike Henjum scored 27  points, and Jeff Bickmore added 26 and nine rebounds to lead the Vanguards  (2-1) in the third-place game.  </P> <P> Bickmore earned all-tournament honors along with Everett Edwards, who scored 22  points for Seattle.  </P> <P> After leading by two at halftime, SCC made 66% of its shots in the second half.  </P> <P> The Vanguards made seven of 11 three-points shots, Henjum making four of six  and adding a team high six assists.  </P></p>

The opening of the road, announced Monday by NPFL radio, was  seen as more symbolic than meaningful, since rival factions from  Liberia's three-year civil war are still moving towards  demobilisation and disarmament.    A rival armed group, the United Liberation Movement (ULIMO),  was still blocking traffic at Kakata, 55 kilometres (35 miles)  north of Monrovia, on a stretch of the same highway where the  NPFL roadblock was raised Saturday.    The ULIMO blockade was imposed in retaliation for the  kidnapping last week of 11 ULIMO fighters, blamed by ULIMO on  Charles Taylor's NPFL, and a refusal by aid agencies to supply  territory it controls in the north and west of Liberia.    The raising of the NPFL blockade was welcomed by Liberia's  interim government, which controls the capital and its  surrounding territory.    However, an official communique warned the step could only  be  a "significant contribution to peace" when all roadblocks and  security checks are dismantled and control of roads is handed  over to the multinational peacekeeping force ECOMOG.    A source close to the Nigerian-led ECOMOG, first posted in  Liberia in August 1990, stressed that roadblocks should only be  raised when disarmament had started.    Liberia has enjoyed a brittle peace since July when warring  factions signed an agreement to lay down their arms and disband  by mid-January.    Organisation of African Unity representative in Liberia  Enoch  Dogolea greeted the NPFL move with a call for the United Nations  to speed up Liberia's peace process at a ceremony marking the  highway opening.</p>

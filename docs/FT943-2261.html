			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: More aluminium gains forecast The aluminium market 'appears determined to move higher', according to Billiton-Enthoven Metals. And it says in its latest Metals Report that it 'is likely to continue to do so in the final quarter of (this) year and beyond, providing the drawdown in LME (London Metal Exchange) stocks continues apace'. Billiton notes that the aluminium market has been in deficit for several months, taking stocks held in LME registered warehouses 278,475 tonnes, or 10.5 per cent, below the record level reached in mid-June. A less marked reduction in producer stocks in member countries of the International Primary Aluminium Institute has been attributed to seasonal factors, the report says, 'and further declines are envisaged'. It points out, however, that the production slow-down following the multilateral agreement reached earlier this year to curb output has been 'rather disappointing'. In June the operating rate, as reported by the IPAI, was down only 100 tonnes a day and in July it was unchanged. 'It will be interesting,' says Billiton, 'to see whether the downtrend is resumed in August's figures, which are to be announced this week.' However, the aluminium market is not relying only on lower production for its present strength, the report notes, 'but also on strengthening demand'. Although there are signs that the US economic recovery is slowing down the country's aluminium demand is expected to post a 'very respectable increase' for 1994. And a continued slowing in US demand next year is expected to be more than compensated by continued improvements in the European market 'and even in Japan'. 'Russia has remained a theoretical 'fly in the ointment' in terms of the tardiness in implementing its pledged production cutbacks (under the multilateral agreement), amounting to 500,000 tonnes (a year) which were originally to be completed by the end of July,' says Billiton. 'However, the market appears to be taking this in its stride.' Aluminium prices edged back at the London Metal Exchange yesterday following the strong gains of the past few weeks. Having burst through the Dollars 1,600-a-tonne barrier on Friday the three months delivery position ran into overhead resistance and what traders described as 'producer-type selling' after moving up to Dollars 1,615 a tonne in early trading. It dipped below the Dollars 1,600 mark a couple of times before closing Dollars 6 down on the day at Dollars 1,602.50 a tonne. Traders said they were looking for further big falls in LME stocks to confirm aluminium's 'upside credentials'.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Western World Primary Aluminium supply/demand balance ('000 tonnes)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                   1995(f)     1994(f)    1993(e)    1992      1991 Production      14,220      14,150     15,053     14,922    15,125 Net imports      1,500       1,600      1,500      1,100       850 Consumption     16,900      16,150     15,550     15,476    14,950 Balance         -1,180        -400     +1,003       +546    +1,025  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Billiton-Enthoven Metals.

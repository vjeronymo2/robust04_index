			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement for Environmental Restoration and Waste Management (EM&hyph;PEIS). The EM&hyph;PEIS will analyze complex-wide environmental restoration and waste management issues and alternatives. DOE published the NOI to prepare the EM&hyph;PEIS on October 22, 1990 (55 FR 42633) and issued an Implementation Plan on December 23, 1993. The Rocky Flats SWEIS will discuss its relationship to the EM&hyph;PEIS and how issues addressed in the EM&hyph;PEIS could affect the alternatives analyzed in the SWEIS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Proposed Interim Storage of Enriched Uranium Above the Maximum Historic Storage Levels at the Y&hyph;12 Plant (Enriched Uranium Environmental Assessment). The Enriched Uranium Environmental Assessment will analyze the treatment and storage of enriched uranium, including highly enriched uranyl nitrates now stored at Rocky Flats and at DOE's Y&hyph;12 Plant in Oak Ridge, TN. DOE will incorporate into the Rocky Flats SWEIS, as appropriate, any decisions made about interim storage and treatment of highly enriched uranium as a result of the Enriched Uranium Environmental Assessment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Resumption of Thermal Stabilization of Plutonium in Building 707, Rocky Flats Plant: Environmental Assessment (DOE/EA&hyph;0887). This environmental assessment analyzed the impacts of heating small quantities of plutonium powder in gloveboxes, under controlled conditions, in Building 707. DOE issued a Finding of No Significant Impact on February 10, 1994. The Rocky Flats SWEIS will incorporate the decisions made about thermal stabilization of plutonium into the Rocky Flats SWEIS and discuss how issues addressed in the Building 707 Environmental Assessment could affect the alternatives analyzed in the Rocky Flats SWEIS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Nonnuclear Consolidation Environmental Assessment (DOE/EA&hyph;0792). The Nonnuclear Consolidation Environmental Assessment analyzed the DOE's proposal to withdraw defense activities from the Mound, Pinellas, and Rocky Flats Plants, and consolidate most of the nonnuclear activities at the Kansas City Plant. Consolidation was evaluated in terms of operating costs, protection of the environment and public and worker health and safety, and preservation of technical competency to maintain the nuclear deterrent. DOE issued a Finding of No Significant Impact on July 8, 1993. The Rocky Flats SWEIS will discuss how issues addressed in the Nonnuclear Consolidation Environmental Assessment could affect the alternatives analyzed in the Rocky Flats SWEIS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement for the Storage and Disposition of Fissile Nuclear Materials. This Environmental Impact Statement will assess alternatives and assist in establishing a national policy for the long term storage and disposition of fissile nuclear materials. Any decisions resulting from the Rocky Flats SWEIS regarding the storage and disposition of fissile nuclear materials will be interim decisions that will not affect the long-term, DOE-wide decisions to be made following completion of the Nuclear Materials Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Site-wide Environmental Impact Statement (SWEIS) for the Nevada Test Site and Other Off-site Test Locations within the State of Nevada. This SWEIS would evaluate alternative management strategies for the Nevada Test Site, which would support current and future defense related missions, research and development, waste management, environmental restoration, infrastructure maintenance, and facility upgrades and alternative uses over the next 5&hyph;10 years. This SWEIS would also address environmental restoration and other related activities at other offsite test locations within the State of Nevada, which include the Project Shoal Area, Central Nevada Test Area, Tonopah Test Range, and portions of the Nellis Air Force Range. In the Nevada SWEIS, DOE would consider the transportation, management and disposal at the Nevada Test Site of wastes from other locations, including the Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Issued in Washington, DC, on July 29, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Tara J.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, April 27, IRNA -- The terrorist Mujahideen  Khalq Organization (MKO) has backed the aborted attempt on the  life of the substitute Friday prayer leader of Mashhad Hojjat  ol-Eslam Aba'i Khorasani, on April 22. In a radio broadcast  from Iraq, the terrorist grouplet described the failed  assassination attempt as a popular move without mentioning its  links with the assassin.    An armed assailant, identified by the Ministry of  Information  as 'Ali Huri, shot and wounded Hojjat ol-Eslam Khorasani on  Friday. He was later arrested by worshippers and handed over to  police. Huri has confessed to his link with the Iraq-based  terrorist grouplet and the MKO has not denied the link.</p>

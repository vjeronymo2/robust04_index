			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / China chills UK out of festive cheer President Jiang Zemin of China last night heralded the new year with warm greetings to all China's friends - especially compatriots in Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan - but stopped short of extending the cordial spirit to Britain. Its 'wrong stand' had 'broken' negotiations on the future of Hong Kong, he said in a speech on China Radio International. Attacks on both Britain and Mr Chris Patten, governor of Hong Kong, intensified in the final days of 1993, suggesting the relationship would continue to deteriorate this year. Mr Zhou Nan, director of China's Xinhua news agency, used his televised new year message to urge Hong Kong people to accelerate preparatory work for the formation of the new government which will take up the territory's reins in 1997. He said Britain's violation of all joint agreements aimed at ensuring a smooth transition to Chinese rule meant this was the only way to guarantee stability and prosperity in the colony. However, the rhetoric has not hit the colony's vibrant markets. The stock market closed the year at an all-time high of 11,888.39. Sino-British relations, already tense, worsened after Mr Patten introduced elements of his bill to extend democracy in the territory to the Legislative Council on December 15. Reuter reports from Beijing: China, which in 1993 ran its first trade deficit in four years, is planning tough curbs on some imports, the official China Daily said yesterday, 'China will adopt strict measures to regulate the importation of machinery and electronics products,' the newspaper said, adding the new rules would take effect from today. The report did not say how the rules would hit China's trade with the US. Washington has been trying to force Beijing to accept more imports since China's trade surplus with the US rose to some Dollars 23bn in 1993, from Dollars 18.3bn the previous year.</p>

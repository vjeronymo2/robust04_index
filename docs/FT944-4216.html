			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / People: Non-executive directors Signet, the UK-based jewellery group formerly known as Ratners, is strengthening its transatlantic ties with the appointment as a non-executive director of the leading US retailer Lee Abraham (above). The move reflects the fact that 60 per cent of Signet's turnover now comes from the US, where it owns the Sterling chain. 'Abraham will bring balance to the (board's) thinking, and make sure the US gets the time and attention it deserves,' says Signet. Abraham, 66, is currently senior non-executive director of Liz Claiborne, the US fashion group. He is perhaps best known as the former chairman, from 1977 to 1993, of Associated Merchandising Services, the New York-based retail merchandising and sourcing organisation which worked with many of the leading department and speciality stores in the US. He built up AMS from a business handling Dollars 140m of shipments in 1977 to more than Dollars 1bn by 1989. By the time Abraham retired, it had 31 offices in five continents. Abraham was one of the first US retailers to start developing connections with China. 'He has a widespread merchandising and retailing background in the US, and tremendous international experience,' says Signet. Before AMS, Abraham was chairman and chief executive of May Merchandising, part of the May department store group in the US.</p>

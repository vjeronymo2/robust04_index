			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Lt-Gen Ilya Grigoryevich Panin, chief of the </F> RVSN Cadres Directorate, by Aleksandr Dolinin, KRASNAYA ZVEZDA  correspondent: "There Is Always a Place for Young People in the  RVSN"]    [Text] The Strategic Missile Troops [RVSN] are the  youngest branch of the Armed Forces. It is noteworthy that about  half here are young officers. And no matter how the fate of  these troops unfolds, they are always waiting for young people  here and counting on them. Our correspondent talks with  Lieutenant-General Ilya Grigoryevich Panin about how to become  an officer in the glorious Strategic Missile Troops.    [Dolinin] Ilya Grigoryevich, have the conditions for  acceptance into missile schools changed in 1994?    [Panin] There are no big differences from past years. The  schools are open to all Russians. Civilian young people are  accepted between the ages of 17 and 21 (as of the year of  admission), and for compulsory-service servicemen and those  discharged into the reserve the age limit is 23 years. Documents  are submitted through military commissariats, military units, or  directly to the chief of the military educational institution  [VUZ]. Entrance examinations for general education disciplines  and psychological screening are conducted from the end of June.    There are correspondence and classroom preparatory courses  at  each of the schools; it is not too late to apply for them now.  Olympiads and "open houses" are held for applicants. At the  Rostov Higher Military Command and Engineering School of the  Missile Troops, for example, a state military-technical lyceum  is run, most graduates of which are enrolled in this school.    Every applicant is tested for physical training (7-11  pull-ups on a horizontal bar, a 100-meter run, a 3000-meter  cross-country run, 100-meter swim). As experience shows, this  poses no special difficulty for most applicants.    Tests are taken on general education disciplines:  Mathematics  (written), physics, Russian language, and literature (dictation  or exposition).    [Dolinin] What is new in the system of training officer  personnel?    [Panin] New? A lot! First of all, the higher military school  reform has begun to produce its first fruits. The list of  officer training specialties and specializations has been  updated. It has resulted in similar civilian lists adopted in  the Russian Federation. In accordance with the Law on Military  Obligation and Military Service, VUZ officer candidates have  concluded contracts. This gave them a considerable monetary  raise. Compare: Before signing a contract, 1st and 2nd year  officer candidates receive up to 24,000 rubles [R] monthly, and  upon reaching 18 years of age and concluding a contract, they  receive more than R100,000! The appointment pay for  lower-echelon commanders and those rated excellent in studies  has been increased.    But this is a concern about officer candidates from the  material standpoint. It is also manifested in another way--the  quality of their engineering and military training is  increasing. Naturally, requirements are also increasing. Today  we regard officer candidates as future professionals, on whom  the defensive capability of Russia and its allies will largely  depend.    [Dolinin] Could you go into more detail about updating the  list of specialties for which future officers are being trained?    [Panin] Officer are trained for 73 specialties and  specializations at RVSN higher military educational  institutions. Many of them are one of a kind and are unique to  Russia. For example, beginning this year, graduates will receive  diplomas for the following specialties: State and regional  administration; engineer protection of the environment;  geophysical methods of search and surveying; laser systems;  automated information processing and control systems; robots and  robotics... What is especially important is that out of all the  diversity of the specialties, there is not a single one which  would not find application in various sectors of the economy,  science, and production. All officer candidates are on familiar  terms with computers.    At our VUZes, officer candidates are given the opportunity  to  receive two or more specialties and defend two diplomas right  away. One can master the program of instruction in 4 years  instead of 5. The best graduates have an opportunity to go on to  graduate work, which our educational institution has. It would  be an aspiration.    [Dolinin] Ilya Grigoryevich, future applicants are  interested  in finding out if there is a chance graduates might end up  without a job given the objective reduction of the Missile  Troops?    [Panin] In accordance with the SOA-1 and SOA-2 [Strategic  Offensive Arms] treaties, the strength of the grouping is indeed  being reduced. But officers will always be needed in the troops,  especially in primary positions. Last year's graduates have been  fully placed and are conscientiously performing their military  duty. The Missile Troops are the youngest branch of the armed  forces, and all paths are open to young people here.

			<p><P> July 10, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> CHORAL SOCIETY OFFERS PROGRAM OF RARE WORKS  </P> <P> Nick Strimple, conductor of the Choral Society of Southern California, has long  kept an eye open for unfamiliar works, and the programs given by the 7-year-old  ensemble have usually reflected that. At Beverly Hills Presbyterian Church  Sunday afternoon, listeners were introduced to no fewer than 10 works falling  outside the pale of the standard repertory.  </P> <P> How satisfying it was to discover the contrapuntal craftsmanship of Krystof  Harant's six-part motet, "Qui Confidunt in Domino" written in 1598; the simple,  unpretentious lyricism of William Billings' "David's Lamentation," and the  spirited buoyancy of Carl Theodor Pachelbel's "Magnificat" (his only known  work).  </P> <P> Each performance reflected the virtues of musicianship and good taste: Musical  lines flowed artfully, releases were clean and dynamics carefully observed.  Because of sectional inequities within the 50-member chorus, however, Strimple  was not able to perfect balances.  </P> <P> Least satisfying were three choruses from Mozart's "Thamos, King of Egypt," K.  345, which opened the program; the choristers brought insufficient clarity to  the German text and insufficient confidence to some of their entrances. Soprano  Barbara Hancock sang her solo lines handsomely; four other soloists performed  acceptably. Pianist Timothy Steele provided effective accompaniment.  </P> <P> Midway though the program, organist Joyce Jones offered engaging readings of  two contemporary Czech works, a brilliant, colorful piece by Jiri Dvoracek and  a neatly constructed, less interesting one by Petr Eben. The Texas-based  musician then skillfully exploited the wit in Ives' Variations on "America."  </P> <P> The program closed with Louis Vierne's "Messe Solennelle," a typical, French  Romantic expression of faith in a style not unlike Franck's. The singers gave a  disciplined yet ebullient performance, and dual organists Jones and Steele  added to the excitement. TERRY McQUILKIN  </P></p>

			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Letter: Did not wait to resign Sir, You ask (Observer, February 21) why did I wait a month after the teletext licence bids were submitted before resigning from the ITN board? The answer is clear - I didn't] I always disagreed with ITN being involved in a bid for the teletext licence and made that clear several months ago at the board of ITN. I also made it clear that, if ITN were involved in a bid, I would not stay on the board. Once the bid was submitted I quietly resigned. When the board met last week they decided to announce my resignation, despite my request to be allowed to go quietly.

The FR Y&hyph;9 and FR Y&hyph;11 series of reports historically have been, and continue to be, the primary source of financial information on bank holding companies and their nonbanking activities between on-site inspections. Financial information, as well as ratios developed from the Y series reports, are used to detect emerging financial problems, to review performance for pre-inspection analysis, to evaluate bank holding company mergers and acquisitions, and to analyze a holding company's overall financial condition and performance as part of the Federal Reserve System's overall analytical effort. The FR Y&hyph;6 report is the Federal Reserve's principal source of internally generated and independently audited financial data on individual bank holding companies and their banking and nonbanking subsidiaries. The report enables the Federal Reserve to monitor bank holding company operations and to ensure that the operations are conducted in a safe and sound manner and in compliance with the provisions of the Bank holding Company Act and Regulation Y.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=3 --> Proposal to approve under OMB delegated authority the revision of:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Report Title: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 -->  Consolidated Financial Statements for Bank Holding Companies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=3 --> Agency Form Number:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 --> FR Y&hyph;9C  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=3 --> OMB Docket Number: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 -->  7100&hyph;0128  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=3 --> Frequency: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 -->  Quarterly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=3 --> Reporters: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 -->  Bank Holding Companies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=3 --> Annual Reporting Hours: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 -->  172,720  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=3 --> Estimated Average Hours per Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 -->  Range from 5 to 1,250 hours  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=3 --> Number of Respondents: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 -->  1,346  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=3 --> Small businesses are affected.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The information collection is mandatory [12 U.S.C. 1844(b) and (c)].

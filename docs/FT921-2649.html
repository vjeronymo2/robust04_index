			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Election '92: Broadcasters put themselves on the schedule - Media Watch THERE is a danger in all this media watching, but please read on. In Monday's Guardian, Loughborough University's monitors unveiled a survey of time devoted to election issues on TV and radio. No surprise that in week one the two most covered themes were the economy and Mr Major's trip to the palace. But in third place? None other than 'the role of the media'. Introspection of this kind leads to self-consciousness and we have already seen some pretty self-conscious broadcasting. Tonight's Dispatches on Channel 4 promises to warm over well-known grouses about alleged political interference and 'self-censorship' on the BBC and ITV in the 1987 election. New life has been breathed into this topic by the BBC's foolish withdrawal of a Panorama treatise on the economy and a spate of equally misjudged attempts by politicians to dictate the terms on which they will appear on programmes, the most recent being Paddy Ashdown's withdrawal from a Channel 4 News interview because his party's manifesto was not being given lead-story status. It is this daily jostling for tactical advantage which is the real stuff of the broadcasters' political battles, not the systematic subversion imagined by conspiracy theorists. The BBC's Nine O'Clock news has made an impressive and influential start in spite of opening with an inexplicable shot of the back of the newscaster's head, John Simpson's despatch from the prime minister's first 'meet the people' session ruffled feathers by proclaiming the event a touch bland and overstaged. Central Office would be wise to react by improving the event, rather than complaining to the BBC. On air, the mood has been anything but cantankerous. The politicians must have been told to keep talking and avoid brawling. Chris Patten, the Tory party chairman, began one reply the other morning with a sugary: 'If you don't mind me being a little critical, that's complete drivel.' As a Daily Mail cartoon put it: 'They never keep their promises - where's this really dirty election we've been looking forward to?' Part of the broadcaster's objective is to penetrate this wall of self-control. From that point of view, Panorama's debate between Messrs Lamont, Smith and Beith on the economy was a write-off. Although Mr Smith's plain language easily outpointed Mr Lamont's City-ese, a lugubrious and over-formal set quenched what passion arose. By the way, don't take my word for that: Anthony Howard popped up on Newsnight as soon as Panorama was off the air to dismiss his sister programme's efforts as over-refereed. In searching for its own way through the political radiation shield, Newsnight has come up with the idea of having politicians from two parties interrogate a third. I suspect this approach may yet draw blood, though not with inquisitors as sweet as Labour's George Robertson and the Conservatives' Virginia Bottomley, who were Monday night's questioners. Many programmes, including an over-long ITV offering called Special Inquiry, have brought floating voters face to face with politicians in TV studios. These events invariably flop. Package Mr Ordinary inside a studio and he usually becomes Mr Dull. Old-fashioned phone-ins, such as the BBC's Election Call, work better; the fact that you can't see the caller is offset by the sense that the interrogator can be more at ease than the politician. But if you want dirt, abuse, outrageous deceit and absence of all scruple, you will have to turn to your daily paper. There are not many floating voters in Fleet Street and already The Sun, Mail, Express, Telegraph and Times (combined daily sale 8.1m) have declared for the Tories, with only the Mirror/Record (sale 3.6m) clearly in the Labour camp. If Mr Patten wants lessons in how to sharpen his message, he need only consult the Mail, whose front page on Tuesday showed John Smith shaking cash from the pockets of a terrified resident of middle England. The headline read: 'If you make it, they'll take it,' and the summary of Labour's fiscal policy was: 'Crush the rich, squeeze the middle classes and put the bite on anyone with a private pension.' All the Mirror had to offer by way of riposte was a 'Goodbye to all this' headline alongside snaps of Mr Smith waving (surely some mistake?) and sundry hard-up Britons; that and a page two story suggesting Mr Major has a face like a fish. As a propaganda contest, it's the Bash Street Kids versus The Terminator. Arts, Page 17</p>

REAGAN HAS TUMOR EXCISED  </P> <P> Former First Lady Nancy Reagan today had a small cancerous tumor removed from  just beneath her left nostril, a family spokesman said.  </P> <P> The basal-cell carcinoma was discovered during a routine dermatological  examination at the Mayo Clinic and was removed by a plastic surgeon at St.  Marys Hospital, said Mark Weinberg, spokesman for Nancy Reagan and former  President Ronald Reagan.  </P> <P> In 1987, doctors at Bethesda Naval Hospital removed Nancy Reagan's left breast  and adjoining lymph glands after a cancerous tumor was found.  </P> <P> The Reagans arrived at the Mayo Clinic on Monday for what Weinberg said were  routine physical examinations as part of their annual checkups and were found  in excellent health.  </P></p>

			<p>930526 FT  26 MAY 93 / Sale of ECGD offshoot backed THE government substantially achieved its objectives when it sold the short-term insurance business of the Export Credits Guarantee Department to NCM, the Dutch insurance company, the National Audit Office says in a report published today, John Willman writes. The public expenditure watchdog says the sales proceeds of Pounds 20m were reasonable in the circumstances. The direct expenses - Pounds 6.7m - reflected its complexity. The NCM bid was the lower of the two bids received for the sale - the government was offered Pounds 25m by Generali, the Italian insurer.</p>

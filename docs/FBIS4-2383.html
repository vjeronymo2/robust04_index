			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 11 (XINHUA) -- Qiao Shi, chairman of  the National People's Congress Standing Committee, said here  today that relations between China and Vietnam should continue  to develop on the basis of traditional friendship.    China is willing to strengthen its cooperation in various  fields with Vietnam, because closer cooperation between the two  countries would benefit peace and stability not only in Asia,  but in the whole world, said Qiao at a meeting here this  afternoon with Dao Dinh Luyen, chief of the General Staff of the  Vietnamese People's Army, and his party.    Generally speaking, ties between China and Vietnam have  soundly developed, Qiao said, and differences existing between  the two countries can gradually be narrowed through  consultations on an equal footing.    Qiao also briefed the guests on the current situation of  China's reform and opening to the outside world, as well as the  building of a socialist market economy with Chinese  characteristics.    Dao told Qiao that the Vietnamese people would never forget  the long-term support the Chinese people offered, and the  Vietnamese Army hopes that its friendly relations with the  Chinese People's Liberation Army can be strengthened.</p>

But the commander, Gen. Boris Snetkov, dismissed reports  that hundreds more soldiers had died in former East Germany under mysterious  circumstances. Snetkov told reporters it will be virtually impossible to  withdraw all his 380,000 troops before 1994 -- the date set by treaty with  Germany.  </P></p>

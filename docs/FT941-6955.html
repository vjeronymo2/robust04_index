			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Grounds for turning over a new leaf - Giles MacDonogh says it is time to start reading the tea leaves a lot more carefully It seems that Britons need a refresher course. It is not quite 45 years since the British left India and they have already forgotten the difference between good tea and bad. Between 80 and 85 per cent of what Britons drink today is CTC (crush, tear and curl) tea from Africa and Latin America. This tea is harvested mechanically and made by a special process which is designed to coat the leaves with the darkest juices in order to provide a tea which will colour up in the shortest period of time. In short, it is perfect for tea bags. Nor has Britain reached the bottom of the spiral of decline. The better brands, such as Lyons and PG Tips, which still use a small percentage of 'orthodox' teas, are being squeezed out of the market by cut-price own-label teas available from supermarkets. The tea inside the sachets is of the poorest quality imaginable. But even those wretched brews may be superceded by tea granules, which make tea by a process identical to instant coffee. The Indians are partly to blame. In the post-colonial years they played a game of cat and mouse with the British brokers, imposing restrictions and pushing up prices. The result was that the British simply looked elsewhere. One source told me that at the beginning of 1978 the Indians were still supplying Britain with 70 per cent of its needs. By the end of the year the figure had dropped to 30 per cent. Leaving aside the Chinese and the Sri Lankans - whose teas are still referred to as 'Ceylon' in the trade - the world's most prestigious tea gardens are to be found in north-eastern India; in Darjeeling and Assam, in the foothills of the Himalayas. There, the tea bushes find the right combination of altitude, heat and damp to ripen the leaves to perfection. Only the downy bud (or pekoe) and the first two leaves are picked. The first two crops or flushes are deemed the best. The Germans and the Japanese fight over the first, the British content themselves with the second. In Darjeeling and Assam there is a hierarchy among the tea gardens reminiscent of the cru system in force in the better French vineyards. In Darjeeling, for example, gardens such as Castleton, Margaret's Hope, Jungpana, Seeyok, Selimbong and Goomti are considered to be consistently excellent. Others occupy the second rank: sometimes, but not always, good. Not all the gardens are Indian owned. Even Brooke Bond, I am told, has a bit of land in India. Until recently I should have been at a loss to tell you where - apart from Harrods and Fortnums - these famous teas might be obtained. Now, however, I can disclose some, if not all of the story. Operating from an office in central London are the Sethia brothers of Newby Enterprises. The Sethias have hit on the brave idea of bringing single-estate Darjeeling and Assam teas to a wider British market. The Sethias buy their tea at auction in India and have it packaged there for shipment to Britain and the US. The cost of teas from the most expensive tea gardens limits their choice to some degree: they cannot afford Castleton or Margaret's Hope; but they can and do buy teas from Jungpana, Seeyok, Selimbong and Goomti, among the best Darjeelings. The teas are unblended, but the names of the estates are not written on the caddies. There is just a number code. I think this is a mistake: it would be nicer to know precisely where the tea came from. The Sethias made me a pot of Darjeeling, Goomti, as it turned out. I was interested to hear them say that for a tea purist it was far worse to see someone put lemon in their tea than milk. Most British brokers choose darker teas precisely because they 'milk up' better than the paler ones. I could not find the elusive 'Muscatel' character which is meant to typify Darjeeling, but recognised a certain peachiness which they said was a good sign. To prove their point, however, they took me off to Sir John Lyon House in the City to meet Edward Foster, a tea broker. Foster guided us into a long room with many drawers full of tea and little pots of Newby tea were brewed alongside some of their commercial rivals. Foster was not unduly upset by the lack of Muscatel. 'It's a rare bird', he said. He said the Newby Darjeeling' had 'a delightful character'. With the Assams he was looking for more 'briskness' or tannin. These were distinctly suitable for milk. Another looked fine enough, but did not have the aromas required of a proper, second flush, Assam. 'This is the better tea', he said, pointing to the Newby Assam. This had the 'Ovaltine, malty character' of proper Assam tea. I had had my course: very refreshing it was too. Newby Darjeeling and Assam teas are available from Safeway supermarkets. A 1/4 lb caddy of Darjeeling costs Pounds 2.65; Assam Pounds 2.49.</p>

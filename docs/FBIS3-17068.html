The vice-premier cited numerous facts proving to great  difficulties with the sale of Russian-made products in the  country's major industrial centres. Thus, about 70 per cent of  dairy and meat products come to the Moscow and St. Petersburg  markets from abroad, while domestic commodity producers are  actually barred from these markets. According to Zaveryukha,  the reason lying behind this is that certain structures find it  more profitable to do business with foreign suppliers than  Russian ones.    The deputy prime minister promised that "this move will not  entail a jump in retail prices for foodstuffs. The new rates of  import duties are to reduce profits of importing organizations  rather than send prices up", he emphasised.    Zaveryukha told reporters that "certain circles objected to  this order, they were openly lobbying against it and continue  lobbying for its cancellation". But the government,  specifically Zaveryukha himself, stand up for support of  agricultural producers in all spheres, including in the  financial one.    "I have been instructed to investigate into the causes of  over- 20-day delay in credits extended by the government to  assist rural areas with the spring sowing campaign", the deputy  prime minister reported. He believes such a delay amounts to  disruption of the sowing campaign and "will result in the loss  of 7-8 million tons of grain this year".    And yet, even with this situation taken into account, Russia  will have enough basic foodstuffs this year, largely made by  domestic producers, Zaveryukha said.</p>

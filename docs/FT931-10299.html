			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / Leading Article: Filling the fiscal hole IT DOES NOT take a genius to spot that the British government is in a spot of bother over its growing budget deficit. Only now is the scale of damage done to the government's finances in the last few years becoming apparent. The forthcoming budget provides an opportunity for the government to outline a credible programme for medium-term fiscal consolidation. Credibility requires the government to acknowledge that tax increases, as well as spending cuts, are necessary. Only then might the government's anti-inflationary promises be believed. The lingering recession that the government's erstwhile exchange rate policy, and slow world economic growth, have bequeathed is partly to blame for the dramatic deterioration in Britain's public finances over the past year. But only partly. The OECD, in an otherwise friendly report on the UK economy, blames the recession for only 70 per cent of the rise in the deficit. The 1991 Autumn Statement's pre-election increases in public spending, combined with cuts in corporation tax rates, make up the difference. On the assumption of growth of 2.4 per cent next year and unchanged fiscal policies, the OECD estimates that the general government budget deficit would be 6 1/2 per cent of gross domestic product in 1994, while the cyclically adjusted deficit would be over 3 per cent. The Institute for Fiscal Studies is prepared to peer further into the future. Assuming growth of 3 per cent a year from 1993-94 onwards, its Green Budget forecasts the public sector borrowing requirement will be Pounds 54bn in 1993-94, which is 8.75 per cent of GDP, and remain over Pounds 50bn until 1998. If the trade constraint restrains growth to half that rate, then the PSBR could reach Pounds 83bn. Even the more optimistic growth scenario means a growing burden of debt interest payments on future taxpayers. By the second half of the 1990s, when interest payments on public debt are expected to be 4 per cent of GDP, stabilising the ratio of gross debt to GDP would require a budget deficit of only 3 per cent of GDP, half the level the IFS expects. In short, the British government must plan to cut its structural budget deficit by the equivalent of about Pounds 20bn a year in current prices if it is to prevent a spiralling rise in the ratio of government debt and interest payments. Part of that saving must come from constraining the growth of public spending below that of GDP. But the scope for substantial public spending cuts in the short term is limited, as chief secretary to the Treasury Michael Portillo acknowledged yesterday. The financial markets will probably be unwilling to absorb gilts on the scale that the government must sell, in the hope that the spending review will come to the rescue. They are more likely to demand punishingly high interest rates on British government securities to cover the inflationary risk. The government must reassure the markets by acknowledging that reducing the fiscal gap will require higher taxes over the next two years. If required, it should balance a credible commitment to fiscal tightening, with a further cut in short-term interest rates in order to ensure that recovery arrives as soon as possible. Whether the government, and the current chancellor, can credibly promise non-inflationary export-led growth is debatable. But the longer it waits before acting, and the more cautious its statements in the meantime, the deeper will be the fiscal hole from which the UK has to climb. This is the second in a series of leaders on the March Budget.</p>

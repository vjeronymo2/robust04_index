			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOARD OF ECONOMISTS / MURRAY WEIDENBAUM: TAKING THE LONG VIEW, THE OUTLOOK FOR  U.S. IS BRIGHT  </P> <P> Since 1981, it has become fashionable for Republicans to praise the incumbent  President for all the good things that happen in the American economy while he  is in office. Simultaneously, Democrats have attacked the occupants of the  White House for all the negatives that have arisen.  </P> <P> Both approaches share a common shortcoming: They implicitly credit government  and especially the presidency with awesome powers over the economy. But our  private enterprise system derives its strength from the fact that most decision  making is decentralized. Under these circumstances, let us undertake a more  modest task: a midterm review of the American economy during the presidency of  George Bush, including a look at the prospects.  </P> <P> It is instructive to describe the conditions under which Ronald Reagan's  presidency ended as a prelude to evaluating more recent developments.  Reaganomics was the most ambitious reform effort in the United States since  Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal. Its legacy is a fascinating mixture: lower  inflation and higher budget deficits, less unemployment and larger trade  deficits, fewer strikes and more government jobs, the deepest recession in half  a century and the longest peacetime recovery.  </P> <P> Not surprisingly, Bush assumed the presidency in a lower key than Reagan did  eight years earlier. Unlike 1981, there was little desire to undo the policies  of his predecessor. The Bush Administration has focused much of its attention  on incremental changes in the budget.  </P> <P> The good news is that the Bush Administration and Congress have jointly  attempted to wrestle seriously with the huge federal budget deficits. That has  been obscured by the messy way in which the decisions were reached. There is no  need to endorse every part of the recent budget compromise, however. I would  have preferred far more emphasis on cutting spending and less attention to tax  increases.  </P> <P> There was little debate over the need to reduce the deficits; no one on either  end of Pennsylvania Avenue could defend the fiscal status quo. Instead, the  deliberations focused on specific tax increases (e.g., on gasoline) and  specific spending programs reduction (e.g., in Medicare).  </P> <P> The bad news, as cynics quickly point out, is that the deficit continues to  rise. The combination of savings and loan bailouts and a weak economy is  pushing the Treasury's annual borrowing to the neighborhood of $300 billion.  Fiscally, that is a rough neighborhood.  </P> <P> Economic forecasting today requires a special blend of heroism. In addition to  analyzing trends in the economies of many nations, it is necessary to make a  prognostication concerning military actions in the Persian Gulf.  </P> <P> A successful conclusion to the Middle East crisis would bolster business and  consumer confidence and contribute to economic expansion. If the standoff  continues, any upturn will be more moderate, as would the Federal Reserve's  response to a soft economy. Of course, an extended shooting war would force  forecasters back to the drawing board.  </P> <P> Because these military developments do not show up in the clearest crystal  ball, it is more useful to concentrate on matters beyond the current business  cycle. The advent of the first recession in eight years is hardly a time to  extol the economic policy of a sitting President. Without downplaying the pain  that arises during downturns in the economy, let us look across the valley to  the next recovery.  </P> <P> Four factors make for continuing long-term strength in the American economy. In  a burst of nonpartisanship, I do not assign Bush exclusive responsibility for  these positive trends:  </P> <P> * The transition from Cold War to Hot Peace. Recent events in the Mideast  underscore the stubborn fact that we live in a dangerous world. Despite the  buildup of force in Saudi Arabia, the pace of military contract awards in the  United States continues downward. The reduction in defense jobs for highly  skilled people is initially painful. But the return of these vital resources to  the civilian economy will provide the opportunity for investing them in  productivity-enhancing activities.  </P> <P> * The shift to private sector research and development. For the entire  post-World War II period, the federal government was the primary R&amp;D  decision maker in the United States by virtue of financing most of the projects  to be undertaken and choosing who would do the work. Since 1981, however, the  amount of money spent by the private sector to finance R&amp;D has exceeded the  government's outlays.  </P> <P> Thus, most R&amp;D now performed in the United States is sponsored by business  to meet its needs and, ultimately, consumer demands. As a result, the 1990s are  bound to witness improved production processes and a heightened flow of new  civilian products.  </P> <P> * The restructuring of American business. In response to foreign competition  and domestic takeover threats, many companies have restructured and downsized  their operations. Simultaneously, they are giving new attention to quality  production of the items they sell. The upshot is a reduction in the cost of  producing goods in the United States. A substantial depreciation in the value  of the dollar since 1985 has reinforced this trend and is making American goods  more competitive.  </P> <P> * The second Renaissance of Western Europe. Industrialized nations are the best  customers of other industrialized nations. Thus, the economic integration of  the European Community by the end of 1992 (EC-92) is creating enhanced market  opportunities for American firms.  </P> <P> Strong U.S. firms with established presences in the EC will do well. Many  European companies, no longer protected by national trade or regulatory  barriers, fear that this new competition from the larger, better capitalized  and higher-tech U.S. firms. Moreover, the American companies tend to have more  experience in selling to continentwide markets.  </P> <P> A great many small and medium-size American companies, however, are unprepared  for EC-92. Their unanticipated new competitors probably will be the larger and  more productive European companies that will enjoy economies of scale in  serving the expanding EC marketplace. Fewer than half of all American companies  have heard of EC-92. Of those that have, only a modest portion have established  strategic plans to respond, either offensively or defensively.  </P> <P> In the larger perspective, we can anticipate that -- like Japanese competition  in the auto market -- a more virulent band of European competitors will force  American companies into another round of productivity-enhancing actions.  </P> <P> In short, although Congress has not outlawed recessions, short-term problems  should not cloud the economy's bright long-term skies.  </P></p>

			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / Housing market hopes boosted THE POTENTIAL for recovery in the housing market is more firmly based than at any time in the past three years, a report by research group Cambridge Econometrics says today, Alan Pike writes. It says prospective purchasers' ability to afford to buy homes has returned to levels that existed before the 1988-89 boom and will continue to improve. Mortgage repayments, which accounted for 44 per cent of average earnings in the first quarter of 1990, fell to 28 per cent by the end of last year. Activity in the housing market remained flat in spite of that improvement, the report says, because of low consumer confidence in the face of rising unemployment and the uncertainty that prevailed before the general election. The most pessimistic set of future assumptions, the report says, implies a marginal rise in the repayment ratio from about 28 per cent of average earnings to 29 per cent - still well below the peak reached in early 1990. A mid-range scenario suggests a continued improvement in affordability to 26 per cent. Cambridge Econometrics Spring Report, 21 St Andrew's Street, Cambridge CB2 3AX.</p>

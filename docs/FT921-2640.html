			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Election '92 (Ballot Box): Militant view Terry Fields, who was expelled from the Labour party for his links with Militant Tendency but is defending Liverpool Broadgreen as an independent, has found a new way of achieving publicity. Fields has diverted the permissible costs of producing election leaflets into making a video, which will be premiered tomorrow evening. He has had 500 copies made - 100 for each of Broadgreen's municipal wards. Supporters will lend copies overnight, but most will be seen through special showings in people's homes, local pubs or shops. His headquarters yesterday were crammed with full-time workers. 'They were all made redundant by the city council last year, so they've got plenty of time to help,' he explained.</p>

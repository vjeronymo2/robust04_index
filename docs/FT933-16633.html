			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / BPB gains 52% as peace breaks out on prices PROFITS of BPB Industries, Europe's biggest plasterboard manufacturer, have jumped 52 per cent following the end of a price war in the UK, France and Germany. Group pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 37.8m to Pounds 57.5m in the 12 months to March. Turnover rose 10 per cent to Pounds 1.12bn. The UK company has cut its final dividend from 7.25p to 4.8p, as forecast in February when it raised Pounds 64m in a convertible bond issue. The total payout is 11.25p. Mr John Maxwell, chief executive, said BPB had decided to rebase its dividend 'in view of the unprecedented economic uncertainties facing the group's main European markets'. Group pre-tax profits, which four years ago exceeded Pounds 200m, were unlikely to return to previous levels even when construction markets recovered, he said. Earnings per share, which rose from 6p to 8.1p, were less than a third of the 32.2p made in 1988-89. Mr Maxwell said western European plasterboard prices, which have risen by an average of 29 per cent since February 1992, were still well below levels prevailing at the end of the 1980s. The increases follow the ending of a price war between the three largest plasterboard producers: BPB, Knauf of Germany and Lafarge-Coppee of France. This left BPB's share of the European market relatively unscathed at between 50 and 55 per cent. The company's share of the UK market, where it previously had a near monopoly, has fallen from more than 90 per cent to about 65 per cent. Mr Maxwell said that Knauf and Lafarge-Coppee now appeared more interested in improving profitability than pursuing market share and that further price rises were likely. BPB's target was to double its return on sales from 7 to 15 per cent and the return on capital from 10 to 20 per cent. Mr Maxwell warned of further job losses as the group sought to cut costs. Some 700 jobs were axed last year resulting in a redundancy cost of Pounds 11m. He expected European plasterboard sales to fall over the next 12 months despite a 'still strong market in Germany' and a faltering recovery in the UK. Lex, Page 18</p>

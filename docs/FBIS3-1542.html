In Luanda today, the Russian Embassy  denied the involvement of private Russian citizens in the  alleged assistance to UNITA. In an exclusive interview with  Radio Nacional de Angola, (Anatoliy Korunov), minister counselor  at the Russian Embassy in Angola, said such involvement is  absurd, but admitted the possibility of Russian aircraft leased  by certain South African companies having been used for other  goals.    [(Korunov)] We have heard that two Antonovs have been  impounded in Namibia. One was an An-26 with a Russian crew,  seized on 5 March. Yet, it has been confirmed that the aircraft  was not carrying anything for UNITA. Moreover, no complaint has  been made to us. The second aircraft had a foreign crew.  Obviously, we know nothing about it. Unfortunately, we lack  information to take action against such violations.    [Correspondent] Are you saying that Russian aircraft  can be leased for a variety of purposes?    [(Korunov)] I think so.    [Correspondent] Even if it may compromise Russia's  integrity?    [(Korunov)] Undoubtedly, that can happen.    The Russian diplomat said if it is confirmed that Russian  aircraft are being used to supply UNITA in southern Angola, his  government will take stern action against the culprits because  they would be violating international and Russian law.    [(Korunov)] As far as we know, no Russian aircraft has  carried (?weapons) for UNITA because that would be in violation  of international and Russian laws. We will take stern action if  we have concrete evidence.    The Russian diplomat reiterated that Moscow adheres  scrupulously to sanctions adopted by the UN Security Council on  UNITA.    [(Korunov)] There is a UN Security Council resolution  on sanctions against UNITA. The Russian Government has approved  special legislation on the violation of sanctions. It makes it  compulsory for every Russian to adhere to the sanctions.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over still of Ciller] </F>   [Text] Prime Minister Tansu Ciller has issued the following  message: Today's massacre in Sarajevo is one of the darkest  chapters in world history. Only a few days ago, I appealed to  the world from heroic Sarajevo to end the tragedy in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. Today's massacre has once more confirmed  how right we were in our appeal. The world should no longer  remain indifferent to this human tragedy. The aggressor should  definitely be punished. The international community should allow  the heroic Bosnian people to defend themselves. The embargo  should be lifted and the aggressor should definitely be deterred  through the use of force. I express my support for and extend my  condolences to the government and people of Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>

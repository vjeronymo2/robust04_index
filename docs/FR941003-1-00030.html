			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (d) of &sect;1.656 is proposed to be amended to state that unless ordered otherwise by an administrative patent judge, briefs shall be double-spaced (except for footnotes, which may be single-spaced) and shall comply with the requirements of &sect;1.653(g) for records except the requirement for binding. As a result, the current distinction between printed and typewritten briefs would be eliminated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraphs (e), (g) and (h) of &sect;1.656 are proposed to be amended to require an original and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> four <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  copies (currently an original and three copies are required) of each brief, any proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, any motion under 37 CFR 1.635 to suppress evidence and any opposition to a motion to suppress evidence. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (g) of &sect;1.656, which permits a party to file proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, is further proposed to be amended to require paragraph numbers for the findings of fact and conclusions of law. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (h) is further proposed to be amended to state that a party's failure to challenge the admissibility of the evidence of an opponent on a ground that could have been raised in a timely objection under &sect;&sect;1.672(c), 1.682(c), 1.683(b) or 1.688(b) constitutes a waiver of the right to move under &sect;1.656(h) to suppress the evidence on that ground at final hearing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (i) of &sect;1.656 currently provides that if a junior party fails to file an opening brief for final hearing, an order may be issued by the administrative patent judge requiring the junior party to show cause why the failure to file a brief should not be treated as a concession of priority and further provides that judgment may be rendered against the junior party if the junior party ``fails to respond'' within a time period set in the order. The expression ``fails to respond'' has been misinterpreted by some junior parties as meaning that the mere filing of a response of any kind to the order to show cause should be sufficient to avoid the entry of judgment. Such an interpretation was not intended and if adopted would effectively negate &sect;1.656(i). The term ``respond'' is proposed to be changed to ``show good cause'' in order to make it clear that a junior party's failure to file a timely opening brief will not be excused unless good cause is shown to explain or justify the failure to file a brief. The language of the rule will then be consistent with the other interference rules concerning orders to show cause, e.g., &sect;&sect;1.640(c) and 1.652. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1.657 is proposed to be amended to be consistent with the proposed changes to the definition of ``effective filing date'' in &sect;1.601(g) to state that in an interference involving an application and a patent where the effective filing date of the application is after the date the patent issued, a junior party has the burden of establishing priority by clear and convincing evidence, and that in other interferences the junior party has the burden of establishing priority by a preponderance of the evidence. The proposed amendment would codify the holding of Price v. Symsek, 988 F.2d 1187, 19990&hyph;91, 26 USPQ2d 1031, 1033 (Fed. Cir. 1993), as clarified by Bosies v. Benedict, 27 F.3d 539, 541&hyph;42, 30 USPQ2d 1862, 1864 (Fed. Cir. 1994). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In &sect;1.658, it is proposed to amend paragraph (a) to state that when the Board enters a decision awarding judgment as to all counts, the decision shall be regarded as a final decision for the purpose of judicial review (35 U.S.C. 141&hyph;144, 146) unless a request for reconsideration under paragraph (b) of this section is timely filed. In paragraph (b), third sentence, it is proposed to delete the phrases ``[w]here reasonably possible'' and ``such that delivery is accomplished'' as unnecessary and to add a sentence specifying that a decision on reconsideration is a final decision for the purpose of judicial review (35 U.S.C. 141&hyph;144, 146). It is also proposed to amend paragraph (b) by changing ``reply to a request for reconsideration'' to be consistent with the terminology employed in &sect;1.640(c) regarding requests for reconsideration of decisions on preliminary motions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Castle Communications rises to Pounds 1.5m REDUCED interest charges and the absence this time of exceptionals helped lift profits at Castle Communications, the USM-quoted video and audio group, by 11.6 per cent, from Pounds 1.36m to Pounds 1.51m pre-tax, over the year to June 30. Mr Terry Shand, chairman, said the results were mixed, with turnover up from Pounds 31.6m to Pounds 33.4m, but operating profits down at Pounds 2.48m (Pounds 2.76m). In the UK, trading conditions for the audio division, which accounts for more than 70 per cent of group turnover, remained difficult, Mr Shand said. Video product sales fell as a consequence of Castle's concentration on own-label requirements of the multiples rather than its general catalogue sales. However, Mr Shand said the group had substantially increased its investment in video tangibles during the year by commissioning special interest programming mainly for WH Smith's own-label requirements. Benefits from that investment should come through in 1993-94, he added. The pre-tax result was struck after net interest payable of Pounds 966,000 (Pounds 1.2m). Earnings per share advanced to 15.1p (10.4p) and the proposed final dividend is unchanged at 4.5p, which maintains the total at 8.5p.</p>

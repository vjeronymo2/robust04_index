			<p><P> January 30, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. FAR OFF ON TROOP ESTIMATES IN CUBA CRISIS  </P> <P> U.S. officials weighing a possible invasion of Cuba at the height of the 1962  missile crisis were off by a factor of four in their estimate of Soviet troop  strength on the island and underestimated the number of Cubans under arms by  about 60%, it was revealed here Sunday.  </P> <P> "We estimated that (the Soviets) had around 10,000 men there and that the  Cubans had around 100,000 men under arms," former U.S. Defense Secretary Robert  S. McNamara said at a news conference wrapping up an unprecedented meeting of  Cuban Missile Crisis participants here.  </P> <P> Instead, Cuban and Soviet officials revealed, there were more than 40,000  Soviet troops on the island and 270,000 armed Cubans.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Fight to Death'  </P> <P> "The entire people was ready to fight to the death," said Jorge Risket Valdes,  a member of the Politburo of Cuba's ruling Communist Party and leader of  Havana's delegation at the extraordinary Moscow meeting.  </P> <P> He told reporters that Cuba had expected to lose as many as 800,000 people if  the United States attacked.  </P> <P> "The figures they gave show it would have been a real war if we had gone in,"  added Graham T. Allison, dean of Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of  Government.  </P> <P> Sunday's disclosures were only the latest of several surprises at the  conference, which was organized jointly by the Soviets and officials of  Harvard's Nuclear Crisis Project. On Saturday it was confirmed that the Soviets  already had nuclear warheads in Cuba at the time of the dramatic 1962 showdown  and that the intermediate-range missiles on which they were to be mounted were  aimed at Washington, New York and other U.S. cities.  </P> <P> While several conference participants credited the common sense of the late  President John F. Kennedy and then-Soviet leader Nikita S. Khrushchev for  avoiding a nuclear conflict that seemed dangerously near, Theodore C. Sorensen,  former special counsel to Kennedy, offered a different view Sunday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Mistaken Assumptions  </P> <P> Sorensen said that he had drawn up a list of 10 mistaken assumptions by parties  to the crisis that were revealed during three days of formal and informal  meetings here.  </P> <P> "The value of this conference to me," he concluded, "is not proving how wise we  all were, but how fallible we all were."  </P> <P> McNamara recalled in a closing statement that a Soviet participant had confided  his decision to evacuate his family to the country at the height of the 1962  crisis for fear of a U.S. nuclear strike on Moscow. "And at the same time in  Washington, on a beautiful fall evening, as I left the President's office to  return to the Pentagon, I thought I might never live to see another Saturday  night," McNamara added.  </P> <P> What the conference underlined, the former defense secretary said, is that "in  this nuclear age, crisis management is dangerous, difficult, uncertain. . . .  Therefore we must direct our attention to crisis avoidance."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Leap of Imagination'  </P> <P> The superpowers "have made little progress" in that direction despite the 26  years that have passed since the Cuban crisis, McNamara said, but he added that  they now have "the greatest opportunity since the end of World War II to  reformulate our relations."  </P> <P> It would require "a leap of imagination for us to conceive of our national  roles in a world not dominated by the struggle between East and West," but both  nations need such a vision, McNamara said. "Conflicts within and conflicts  between nations will not disappear," he said. But the superpowers could assure  that they would not be nearly so dangerous if they would agree that: "Neither  would seek to take advantage of such disputes to increase or extend their  political or military power beyond their borders, and their bilateral relations  would be conducted according to rules of conduct which precluded the use of  force."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Scars Run Deep  </P> <P> The fact that such prominent personalities on all three sides of the 1962  crisis could for the first time sit down with one another to discuss it was  hailed as a sign of significant progress. But Sunday's news conference also  showed that the scars still run deep.  </P> <P> Cuban delegation leader Risket repeatedly threw verbal jabs at the Americans  for maintaining a hostile policy toward his country and, in a more surprising  move, leveled rare public criticism at Cuba's Soviet allies over the fact that  Havana was never consulted before Khrushchev finally pulled his missiles out of  Cuba.  </P></p>

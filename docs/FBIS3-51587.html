			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Freddy Munoz, newly elected senator and </F> secretary general of Movement Toward Socialism, by Alfredo  Palacios; from the "Opinion in the News" segment of "The News"  newscast -- live]    [Text] [Palacios Good afternoon, senator.    [Munoz] Good afternoon Alfredo and friends.    [Palacios] MAS [Movement Toward Socialism] will be in the  government for the first time. Although it has been in the  government at the regional level, it will now be in the  government at the national level. MAS will be in the ruling  group at a time when the country is experiencing a difficult  period. For an example of this, we just have to think of the  economic problems and the enormous fiscal hole in which we are.    [Munoz] It is not a hole but a long tunnel of financial  difficulties.    [Palacios] We have spiraling inflation and constant Bolivar  devaluations. Although we understand that President-elect  Caldera will be the central figure, what will be the policy or  guidelines that MAS will promote in the new government?    [Munoz] You already said it. Definitely, a very important  part of what will be done is in Caldera's hands. The specific  guidelines to carry out the policies are in his hands. Of  course, we will be a force within the government. We want that,  and Caldera wants that. Thus, it should be very clear to  everyone, the public, the president -- he is already very clear  about it -- our people, and the MAS leadership that we will be a  force that will enter the government through the big doors and  with great responsibility.    [Palacios] In specific terms, what does that mean?    [Munoz] It means that we will participate in formulating the  great policies of the new government. It will be done through a  dialogue with Dr. Caldera and those who make up his government  team, including MAS members and friends. It also means that we  will act as a force that will watch and follow up the work done  by the government. This force will also analyze the government  and draw up conclusions. In the third place, we will be a link  between the government and people in the streets, the civic  society, and the world of the majority.    We will not be a force that because it is in the government  it becomes a staunch supporter, loses its critical spirit,  forgets its autonomy, and only talks and acts as the government.    [Palacios] Does it mean that at any given moment you could  act as an opposition force?    [Munoz] I am not saying that. I am saying that we must be a  force that is not unconditional. Why? Because by being a  government force, we have great responsibility to the country.  In fact, we decided to enter the government and back Caldera  because we felt that -- under the present historic circumstance  -- we were fulfilling our responsibility to the country.  Caldera seemed to be the candidate who -- under the present  circumstances -- could best do the difficult job of facing the  situation you mentioned when we were talking about economic  matters. However, it is a situation that spreads to other areas  of our lives. Consequently, our primary obligation is to the  country. Our obligation to the country is partly fulfilled  through our work with the government, but particularly through  our direct contact with the people.    [Palacios] But to have a position of weight within the  government, you should hold important posts in that government,  especially in what is known as the economic cabinet. Will you  be present there?    [Munoz] We have been holding talks with the president. It  is no secret that he is not finished deciding who will be in his  government. It is true that he is discussing that with us too.  It is not our right but our duty to discuss these matters with  him. We are not a force that will tell him: Here are our people  ready to obey you. No, we will be part of the government, but  we will discuss and reach a basic understanding as to what  course the government will take.    To support Caldera, we discussed a basic offer for the  country. We reached agreements.    [Palacios] To give the country that course...    [Munoz interrupting] ...our presence must have the necessary  weight.    [Palacios] That is correct.    [Munoz] Only if this presence has the necessary weight, will  we participate in the new government. I think this is something  Dr. Caldera understands very well. For this reason, we said  that there will be an agreement.    [Palacios] Amid the situation I described at the  beginning, there is the VAT problem. This is one of the most  controversial issues right now.    [Munoz] That is true.    [Palacios] And it will continue to be a hot issue until we  see the measures that the new government will take. What is the  proposal you have in this regard: eliminating the VAT once and  for all, and if so, what will you replace it with? What will  you do?    [Munoz] Let me tell you what we MAS members think, what we  have proposed to Dr. Caldera, what we are discussing with him.  When I say discussing I mean we are exchanging opinions.    During the electoral campaign we said the VAT should be  suspended, not eliminated for good. We believe it is not  correct for the VAT to never have existed. There are only five  countries left in the world without VAT. These are countries  with different characteristics and levels of development.    We said it should be suspended to determine how the tax  could  be created within the framework of global tax reform and, above  all, within the framework of global fiscal reform. Here, when  the VAT was presented as a proposal, not under the Velasquez  administration but under the Carlos Andres Perez administration,  the government wrongfully tried to compensate for the enormous  reduction resulting from the approval of the income Tax Reform  Law, which reduced payments from higher-income sectors, with the  VAT. We said this was absolutely absurd, that is to reduce the  income tax contribution from the wealthy to such a level. We  said it was completely unfair from the social viewpoint, and  erroneous from the fiscal policy viewpoint.    [Palacios] Does this mean that you are thinking about  increasing income tax?    [Munoz] Yes. That is one.... [pauses] our first proposal....    [Palacios, interrupting] Experience has taught us that  taxpayers somehow evade income tax payments....    [Munoz, interrupting] That is right, but VAT payments are  also evaded. World experience indicates that the level of  evasion for income tax is higher than that for VAT, but VAT  payments are also evaded. It has been estimated, in places  where collections are performed more efficiently, that VAT  payments are evaded by at least 30 to 40 percent.    [Palacios] In this fiscal reform you have announced, is  there  any specific measure that can be made public?    [Munoz] One, we will work to reform the Income Tax Law to  increase collections of this tax. Two, we will reorganize the  tax collections system and will implement new collections  techniques that may include hiring specific specialized  companies to perform collection duties. These techniques have  been applied in other countries, and even in some Venezuelan  states. Three, some taxes such as tax on luxury consumption,  which is fair from the social standpoint....    [Palacios, interrupting] Will these taxes be enough to close  the fiscal deficit? This is the great concern facing  Venezuelans.    [Munoz] We will also reduce spending as much as possible.  The fiscal gap is reduced and is definitely closed not only by  increasing fiscal revenues, but also by cutting government  spending.    [Palacios] Reduction of government spending usually  translates into dismissal of personnel.    [Munoz] Not necessarily.    [Palacios] If a real spending reduction is desired,  personnel  must be dismissed.    [Munoz] Listen, government spending is rigid in Venezuela.  That means it has several components whose dimensions are seldom  modified. But there is a part of spending that can indeed be  reduced. This portion may not represent one fourth of total  spending, but it may represent one tenth or one fifteenth.    Following a path of alternative solutions that do not close  the gap, the government may propose with the understanding and  acceptance of the population -- which will see there are other  decisions and actions being taken and promises being met, while  the government is working efficiently -- a reformulation of the  VAT-type tax.    [Palacios] To conclude this interview because we are short  on  time, did you aspire to run for the post of Senate president.    [Munoz] No, I did not hope to run.    [Palacios] At least this is what you had said.    [Munoz] MAS proposed that we should [words indistinct]  continues to feel that way.    [Palacios] National Convergence has proposed a different  candidate. Does this mean you are experiencing your first big  difference with National Convergence.    [Munoz] No, it is only a difference and we are going to  discuss it.    [Palacios] We thank Freddy Munoz for being with us today.</p>

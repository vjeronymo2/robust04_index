			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Nick Olivari] </F>   [Text] The beleaguered SAP [South African Police], which  has seen 14,000 seasoned members resign in the past two years,  is facing a fresh crisis. This follows the leaking to  rank-and-file members of the contents of a top-level directive  demanding the names of all policemen in the Witwatersrand region  who have fired their weapons two or more times in the line of  duty. The order was given by commissioner Lieutenant-General  Koos Calitz and sent out in a confidential February 2 letter  from the SAP's Human Resources Department to all specialist  units and station commanders.    Coming less than three months before election, the demand is  being seen at grassroots level as extremely sinister, especially  in light of the ANC's [African National Congress] promise last  year that once in power, the file of each and every SAP member  would be reviewed to rid the force of those with "blood on their  hands."    The SAP was quick to deny this week that the information was  part of a "witch hunt," saying it was needed to identify SAP  members suffering from post-traumatic stress syndrome and who  may be in need of counselling. SAP spokesman Colonel Dave Bruce  also denied that the list was linked to a request from the ANC  for details of shootings involving Lance-Sergeant Allan Kruger,  found by an inquest court to have been responsible for the death  of Ismael Moloane, one of ANC deputy president Walter Sisulu's  bodyguards, during a high-speed shootout on the Soweto highway  last July.    But grassroots members remain unconvinced. One, who resigned  this week, said: "The ANC just asks for something and that's it.  No one gives a damn about us."    Senior police officers said they did not believe the  information was being sought in the interests of individual  members. "All you have to do is fire warning shots on two  separate occasions, and your name goes on the list -- so almost  every cop in uniform will be on it." said one. Said another:  "What are we supposed to do? Get out there and chase car  hijackers armed with AKs, knowing that if we use our weapons,  we'll end up on some list?"    Morale in the SAP -- already at an all-time low according to  SA [South African] Police Union (Sapu) president Andy Miller --  has been further eroded by the directive. But the biggest  danger to law and order lies in the warning by the newly-formed  and 10,000-strong Sapu that the lists could lead to widespread  labour unrest within the force.    National secretary Peter-Don Brandt says: "It seems as  though these lists could form part of so-called 'commissions of  truth,' with the police being blamed for enforcing unjust laws  of the past, when everyone knows it's the politicians who should  take that responsibility."    This week, a number of policemen who have resigned since  January told the SUNDAY TIMES they were disillusioned and  disgusted by the "lack of direction and uncertainty which is not  being addressed by the brass."</p>

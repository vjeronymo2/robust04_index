			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Norms of Professional Ethics of Chinese Journalists" </F> adopted at the First Plenary Session of the Fourth Chinese  Journalists Association in January 1991, amended by the Second  Plenary Session of the Fourth Chinese Journalists Association in  April 1994]    [Text] Beijing, 9 Jun (XINHUA) -- "Norms of  Professional Ethics of Chinese Journalists"    Chinese journalism is an important integral part of the  socialist cause led by the CPC. Journalists must adapt  themselves to the needs of the new situation; endeavor to  publicize Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought, and Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese  characteristics; publicize the party and government's principles  and policies; report news and disseminate information; reflect  and guide public opinion; and give full play to its role as the  ears, eyes, and mouthpiece of the party and the people. They  must also promote the socialist market economy, socialist  democracy and the legal system, and the socialist spiritual  civilization; and must exert themselves in the struggle for  accomplishing the grand goal of socialist modernization.    Journalists must be devoted to the cause of socialist  journalism; uphold the party's basic line; adhere to the  orientation of serving the people and socialism; emancipate  their minds and seek truth from facts; carry forward the fine  tradition and style of journalism of the party and the people;  oppose money-worship, hedonism, and extreme individualism; and  step up the cultivation of professional ethics.  <H5>  I. Serving the People Wholeheartedly </H5>   To serve the people wholeheartedly is the fundamental goal  of  Chinese journalism.    Journalists, led by the party, should adhere to the correct  direction in guiding public opinion, give play to their role as  the bridge and link between the party and government and the  masses, and persist in identifying their responsibilities toward  the party and government with those toward the people.    They should endeavor to report the party and government's  policies and views to the masses promptly, accurately, and  thoroughly; to provide news and information in order for the  masses to fulfill their duties as masters of the country, to  take part in political, economic, cultural, and social life, and  to keep abreast of what is happening in the world; to laud the  people's creativity and laborious achievements in socialist  construction; and to correctly reflect the people's wishes,  voices, and demands.    They should support correct ideas and actions that conform  with the people's interests; dare to criticize and expose  erroneous statements and actions, and negative and corrupt  phenomena that contravene the people's interests; and actively  bring into play the role of public opinion in exercising  supervision.    They should carry out the mass work enthusiastically,  maintaining close contacts with the masses, attaching importance  to letters and visits from the people, properly handling their  suggestions, criticisms, complaints, and crime-reporting letters  and visits, and offering wide-ranging service activities for the  people.  <H5>  II. Taking Social Benefit as the Supreme Criterion </H5>   Journalists should correctly handle the relationship between  social and economic benefits, giving top priority to social  benefit, and achieving the unity between economic and social  benefit under this basic premise. They should publicize  patriotism, collectivism, and socialism through news, opinions,  pictures, and audio and video products in order to mobilize and  unite the Chinese people of all nationalities in dedicating  themselves to the great undertaking of building up the  motherland and rejuvenating the Chinese nation. They should  adhere to the principle of positive publicity and hold  themselves responsible to society and the masses, so as to help  the expansion of productive forces of socialist society, the  upholding of the four cardinal principles and the reform and  opening up policy, the maintenance of social stability, and the  enhancement of ideological and moral quality, and scientific and  cultural standards of the entire Chinese nation. They should  not advocate in news reports pornography, murder, violence,  ignorance, superstitions, and other materials of vulgar taste to  the detriment of the people's physical and mental health; and  should foster forward-looking, healthy, civilized social  practices.    They should strictly follow the government's policies toward  ethnic minorities and religion in news reports, safeguarding  national interests and unity, and maintaining and promoting the  motherland's reunification.  <H5>  III. Observing Laws and Discipline </H5>   Journalists should conduct themselves within the scope of  the  Constitution and other laws, conscientiously observing the  Constitution, other laws, and the discipline for publicity.    They should steadfastly publicize and implement the party  Central Committee's line, principles, and policies; they should  not use the media in their control to publicize materials  contrary to the party Central Committee's decisions.    They should safeguard the citizens' rights as stipulated in  the Constitution; they should neither slander other people nor  violate their privacy. They should gather news through  legitimate means, and should respect the views and lawful  demands of people they interview.    They should uphold judicial dignity. Before the court  announces the verdict on a case heard by the judicial  department, they should not carry biased reports to predetermine  the nature or establish the crime of the case. Reports on cases  heard publicly should conform with the judicial procedures.    They should keep party, state, military, scientific and  technological, financial, and commercial secrets, and take care  to protect the state's interests and security.    They should safeguard their legitimate rights and interests,  as well as the rights to which they are entitled, including that  of appeal.  <H5>  IV. Safeguarding the Truthfulness of News </H5>   Truthfulness is the lifeblood of journalism. Journalists  should seek truth from facts, go deep into the realities of  life, go among the masses, and step up investigation and study.  They may not make groundless accusations, imagine things,  concoct stories, resort to deception, or distort facts for  sensational effects.    They should make every effort to look at a matter from all  sides; guard against subjectivity, one-sidedness, and the  practice of viewing things in absolute terms; and strive to  ensure the overall or essential truthfulness of things.    They should carry out work earnestly and responsibly, and  avoid false reporting. In case of false reporting, they should  assume responsibility on their own and take remedial measures.  <H5>  V. Upholding the Principle of Objectivity and Fairness </H5>   Journalists should uphold dialectical and historical  materialistic viewpoints, proceed from the people's fundamental  interests, reflect things as they are, and ensure objectivity  and fairness.    In covering events, writing news stories, or filing news  items, they may not be driven by selfish individual or  small-group interests, may not vent their personal anger through  the media under their control, and may not file unfair reports.    They should implement the principle of "letting a hundred  flowers blossom and a hundred schools of thought contend,"  respect scientific and practical approaches, and refrain from  passing judgment at will or taking sides arbitrarily regarding  controversial academic issues.  <H5>  VI. Maintaining the Work Style of Performing Official </H5> Duties Honestly    Journalists should maintain and carry forward the fine  tradition of hard work and plain living, conduct themselves  honestly, exercise self-discipline, and conscientiously observe  fiscal and economic discipline, as well as fiscal rules and  regulations.    They should overcome unhealthy practices in their trade.  They may not publish or carry various forms of "paid news  stories," trade news stories or newspaper space, demand gifts in  cash or in kind, or seek personal gain. They may not accept  cash gifts or negotiable securities in any form from the areas,  units, or individuals they report.    They should strictly distinguish journalistic affairs from  operational matters. Reporters and editors may not engage in  advertising or other operational activities in order to seek  profit.    They should maintain an industrious and thrifty work style.  They may not make special demands on the areas or units they  cover for material comforts or treatment accorded them.  <H5>  VII. Displaying the Spirit of Unity and Cooperation </H5>   Giving scope to overall superiority through unity and  cooperation is a major distinctive feature of socialist  journalistic work. Journalists should be modest and eager to  learn from the public, through practice, and from their  colleagues. Fellow journalists should foster a relationship  based on equality, unity, fraternal love, and mutual assistance;  promote fair competition in their trade; and combat the practice  of deliberately creating difficulties for colleagues or  tarnishing colleagues' reputations in order to serve selfish  individual or small-group interests.    They should respect the copyrights of colleagues and other  authors, and combat the practice of copying or plagiarizing the  products of other people's labor.  <H5>  VIII. Enhancing Friendship and Cooperation With Press </H5> Circles in Other Countries    News reporting should be geared toward enhancing  understanding, friendship, and cooperation between people in  various countries; respecting the sovereignty and national  traditions of other countries; opposing hegemonism and power  politics; safeguarding world peace; and promoting common  development on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful  Coexistence.    They should develop exchanges and cooperation with press  circles in other countries, and show mutual respect and  safeguard the dignity of the motherland and Chinese journalists  during such contacts.</p>

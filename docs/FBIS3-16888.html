This  was the result of a Moscow meeting between Russian First Vice  Premier Oleg Soskovets and representatives of the combine's  workers' collectives.    It was noted at the meeting that state support for the  Magnitogorsk Combine is needed because modernization of the  production facilities there has been halted owing to a shortage  of funds.</p>

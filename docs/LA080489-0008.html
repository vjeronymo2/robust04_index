			<p><P> August 4, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HOSPITAL LAYS OFF 20, CUTS WORK HOURS  </P> <P> San Pedro Peninsula Hospital, as expected, has laid off 12 full-time employees  and eight part-time workers, and reduced the hours of 19 other people, said  hospital President John Wilson.  </P> <P> In addition, five unfilled jobs were eliminated and four people were  transferred to other positions. The actions, which will save the hospital $1.1  million, are part of a previously announced plan to eliminate the equivalent of  100 full-time jobs by Oct. 1. Wilson said the actions accounted for 36 of those  job equivalents and affected 13 hospital departments.  </P> <P> Wilson said he hopes further reductions can be achieved "through attrition and  normal turnover" without the necessity of more layoffs or reduced hours. The  hospital is trying to overcome a $9-million loss in 1987 and 1988.  </P> <P> Since launching a program earlier this year to streamline the hospital and stem  financial losses, San Pedro Peninsula has laid off 129 people and reduced the  hours of 45 others.  </P></p>

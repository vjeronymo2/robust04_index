			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Professor Itamar Rabinovich, Israel's ambassador to  the United States, told our correspondent Arye Golan that there  will be no change in the negotiations with Syria because of  Basil al-Asad's death.    [Begin recording] [Rabinovich] We are taking part in  negotiations with the state of Syria, and people negotiating  with Syria should not engage in analyses and speculations about  the country's domestic problems. After checking with the State  Department, it turns out that as things stand at the moment my  Syrian counterpart will report to the talks on Monday [24  January]. For our part, we will report on time, and the  negotiations will begin and be conducted as normal.    [Golan] Do you foresee that in the round of talks opening  next week we will be called upon to decide on concessions,  perhaps very big concessions, regarding the Golan Heights?    [Rabinovich] No. We know what Syria's demands are. The  Syrians want us to make very big concessions. We have  indications that in the meeting between Presidents Clinton and  al-Asad the Americans were impressed that the Syrians are  prepared to meet us halfway on the questions of peace. We have  yet to receive from the Syrians direct and authoritative  corroboration of this information. We have yet to discuss  security and other issues pertaining to these negotiations with  the Syrians before we reach the moment where decisions are  required on our part. Therefore, we are not talking about a  time frame. The resuming negotiations have a crowded agenda,  and I believe the diplomacy that preceded them produced enough  steam to get the negotiating cart moving. However, it is too  early to tell when exactly we will have to start discussing our  part of the equation.    [Golan] Ambassador Rabinovich believes no breakthrough was  made in the meeting at the White House last night between  Jordan's King Husayn and President Bill Clinton.    [Rabinovich] Judging by all appearances, the meeting was  routine and, as far as we know, nothing dramatic occurred.  Israel's relations with Jordan and the Israeli-Jordanian  negotiations have been a long-standing affair, full of meetings  and sessions, including many sessions without our attendance in  which these negotiations are discussed. I think the  Clinton-Husayn meeting should be seen in that light. [end  recording]    [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 0800 GMT on 22 January  carries an interview with Rabinovich by IDF Radio political  correspondent Natan Gutman; the place and date is not given.  Rabinovich says Syria should be pleased with Israel's  announcement about a referendum on the future of the Golan. In  a recorded passage, the ambassador says: "This is the first  time that an Israeli Government decides such a move. The  Syrians should read this move to mean that the government  regards these negotiations and their possibilities very  seriously. Were I in their shoes, I would be encouraged that  the Israeli Government regards these negotiations and their  possibilities so seriousnly."]</p>

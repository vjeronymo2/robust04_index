			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "PvdA Wants Further Cuts of 400 </F> Million To Create 35,000 New Jobs"]    [Text] In its election platform, the PvdA [Netherlands  Labor Party] wants to make extra cuts of 400 million guilders to  benefit the long-term unemployed. The [party's] primary aims  are to create part-time jobs in the health care sector and to  combat crime. PvdA leader Kok intends to find this sum by  restructuring the national budget.    The PvdA is thereby boosting its commitment to combat  long-term unemployment by increasing the funds earmarked for  this purpose from 1 to 1.4 billion guilders. During the  upcoming legislative period, [the party believes that] 35,000  additional jobs must be created for the long-term unemployed.  However, yesterday, at the presentation of the PvdA platform,  entitled "Samen aan het Werk" [Together at Work], Kok was unable  to stipulate the budget lines along which cuts will be made.  People within the party are reckoning on extra cuts being made  in subsidies through applying priciples of profit, fighting  against fraud, and paying greater attention to implementing the  social security system more efficiently.    With this platform, the PvdA wants to force national and  local PvdA leaders to commit themselves over the next four years  to enhancing efforts made to help the long-term unemployed get  back to work. "An increasing number of people are out of work,  while there is so much moonlighting being done. We must come to  better grips with this," said Kok. The primary concerns include  the financing, organization, and streamlining of rules and  regulations. Kok maintains that there must be "greater  flexibility regarding how allowances are used." The PvdA  believes people receiving an allowance must be able to do  "socially useful work." According to State Secretary H. Simons,  the PvdA's leading candidate in Rotterdam, "obstacles to a  higher levels of employment must be cleared away." Like Kok, he  too believes that "social decline" can be combated by getting  "people who were squeezed out of work some time ago" back to  work.    Just a few weeks ago, the PvdA announced that no further  cuts  were necessary.</p>

Representatives from Russia and the Baltic states  "simply have to gather together and constructively resolve  problems inherited from their common past," Russian Deputy  Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin told a news conference in  Moscow on Thursday.    According to him, Russia "has the impression that some  Baltic  politicians believe that they can ensure their national  interests by means of confrontation with Russia." This is "a  great delusion," Churkin noted. "They can protect their  sovereignty in real terms only by building relations of  partnership with Russia. Russia acts in precisely this way, and  it hopes that this kind of approach will triumph," the deputy  foreign minister said.    Speaking about the presence of Russian troops in the Baltic  countries, Churkin said that Russia has already withdrawn 85% of  its troops from there. He called attention to the fact that at  the very beginning of this process Moscow insisted on the need  to sign corresponding inter-governmental agreements.  "Unfortunately, the Baltic countries failed to understand the  realities we have to cope with, when, despite our serious  internal problems, we remove our troops from there," Churkin  said. Russia, he stressed, "is seeking to imbue this process  with an element of greater cooperativeness."    According to Churkin, at present Russia and the Baltic  countries are "at the decisive stage of final troop withdrawal."  In his view, 90% of the agreement on troop withdrawal from  Latvia is ready. What remains to be coordinated are questions  connected with the situation of military retirees and with the  functioning of the radar station in Skrunda.    With reference to the human rights situation in the Baltic  countries, Churkin stressed that Russia "never linked the issue  of troop withdrawal to changes in the situation of Russian  speakers." "Moreover, it is Latvia and Estonia which insisted on  such linkage, saying that the situation of ethnic Russians in  the Baltic countries will improve after the withdrawal of  troops. We view this as a promise. Let's see how they honor  it," he said.    Speaking about Estonia's territorial claims to several areas  in Russia's Pskov Region, Churkin pointed out that "there is no  need to create additional irritants, which, as a matter of fact,  will bring no practical results. We can take retaliatory  measures, and our Estonian partners will not like it." In his  view, "the territorial issue is clear. This is Russian  territory, it is controlled by Russia, and our present border  with Estonia has the status of state frontier."</p>

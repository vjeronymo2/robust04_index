			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Government Bonds: Strong Thanksgiving retail sales hit Treasuries US Treasury prices fell yesterday amid reports of strong retail sales over the Thanksgiving weekend and the release of figures showing growth in home sales for October. Late in the session the benchmark 30-year government bond was down 13/32 at 94 17/32 yielding 7.977 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was down  1/8 at 99 27/32 , yielding 7.318 per cent. The market's mood was not helped by the afternoon auction of three-month Treasury bills, where in spite of moderate demand the issue's average yield rose to its highest level for 3 1/2 years. The average yield on the short-term bills hit 5.44 per cent the highest level since August 1991. Reports of a busy weekend from shopping malls across the country reawakened fears that recent interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve might not be enough to cool the economy. If so, the Fed might have to raise interest rates again in the near term, undermining bond prices. Adding to such concerns were figures from the National Association of Realtors showing sales of existing single-family homes increasing by 0.5 per cent from September to October. The head of the real estate association called the increase 'a vote of confidence in the economy' but added that he expected rising interest rates would eventually dampen home sales. Bond market declines came in the wake of gains in most stock indices. For most of this year, the stock market has taken its cues from increases and decreases in the bond market, but last week's plunge in share prices created optimism among bond market players that investors would move assets from stocks to bonds. Yesterday's advance in US share prices, however, slowed the development of any such trend. UK gilts put in another strong performance, buoyed by hopes for a market-friendly Budget containing significant cuts in government spending and public-sector borrowing, and ebbing political worries. Gilt market participants expect chancellor Mr Kenneth Clarke's Budget speech today to contain good news on all fronts. 'The market has got geared up for a good Budget, including a cut in spending, a reduction in the (public sector borrowing requirement), a cut in the inflation forecast and an upward revision of the GDP forecast,' said Mr Nigel Richardson, head of bond research at Yamaichi International. Dealers reported last-minute buying by institutional investors keen to catch any post-Budget rally. However some warned that good news may already be discounted and a package in line with expectations could prompt only a muted reaction or even some profit-taking. 'Clarke will have to deliver something pretty spectacular in order for the market to go higher,' said a gilt dealer at a large London house, pointing to supply as a factor that could cap gilts' upside. The Bank of England yesterday announced sales of Pounds 800m in tranches of existing gilts; moreover, on Wednesday it is due to announce the terms of next week's auction. The December long gilt future on Liffe rose by about  3/8 to 103 17/32 . German bonds fell in thin volume. The December bund futures contract on Liffe ended at 91.31, down 0.17 on the day. One analyst said the next data that might move the market would be the US non-farm payroll figures due at the end of this week. The market in Italian government bonds outperformed other European markets yesterday as the yield on the 10-year benchmark bond fell 13 basis points to 11.93 per cent. Analysts said the rise in the price of bonds was due to lack of negative political influences, and Mr Simon Maggs at IBJ said it suggested that investors now felt the budget was likely to be passed. The yield on the 10-year Norwegian benchmark bond rose from 8.4 to 8.416 per cent. Mr Graham McDevitt at Paribas Capital Markets said investors were now focusing on the referendum on membership of the European Union. He said: 'A 'yes' would come as a big surprise as the 'no' camp has consistently been in front.' He added that if there were a majority in favour of EU membership, the currency would probably rise and bond yields fall. However, opposition parties had said they would try to block membership if there were no decisive result, so a small majority in favour would probably lead to a parliamentary struggle, he said.</p>

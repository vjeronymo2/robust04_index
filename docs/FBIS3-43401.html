			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The search for peace has resumed in the Zambian  capital, Lusaka. However, the main strategy of Luanda is to  continue exterminating the populations within the framework of  the prolonged political and tribal genocide, while it falsely  sings the song of negotiations. Our central news desk yesterday  received reports from Uige that two SU-22 fighters coming from  Luanda dropped a deadly cargo of bombs over the cities of Uige  Negage and Quitexe. Many civilians were killed and others  wounded. However, we do not have exact information and numbers  of casualties caused by yet another barbarous action by the  Futungo de Belas Palace.</p>

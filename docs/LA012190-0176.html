			<p><P> January 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ACTIVISTS RIP MAHONY AT CATHOLIC MEETING;  </P> <P> RELIGION: SUPPORTERS OF ABORTION AND AIDS RIGHTS SNEAK INTO A KNIGHTS OF  COLUMBUS GATHERING AND DENOUNCE THE ARCHBISHOP AS A HYPOCRITE FOR CHURCH'S  STANDS ON ABORTION, SAFE SEX AND CONDOMS.  </P> <P> A group of AIDS and abortion rights activists posing as Knights of Columbus  infiltrated a Catholic breakfast meeting Saturday in Hollywood and shouted down  Archbishop Roger Mahony from a back table as he began the keynote address.  </P> <P> "You're a liar, Mahony! Hypocrite! Murderer!" the four demonstrators screamed,  as several members of the religious fraternal group leaped from their breakfast  of bacon and scrambled eggs to drag the protesters from the Blossom Room at the  Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel.  </P> <P> Paul Sbrizzi, 29, of Highland Park said he had organized the disruption with  two other men and a woman to protest the Roman Catholic Church's stands against  abortion and the use of condoms for safe sex. Sbrizzi said the four had acted  as individuals, although all are members of ACT-UP LA, the AIDS Coalition To  Unleash Power.  </P> <P> The protesters, who were not arrested and later joined a picket line outside  the hotel, had just come from an early morning demonstration outside a women's  health clinic in Pacoima where about 600 supporters of abortion confronted  about 250 abortion foes. The peaceful action was one of a number of rallies  held nationwide to mark the 17th anniversary on Monday of Roe vs. Wade, the  U.S. Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion.  </P> <P> Mahony, who has been the target of protests by AIDS activists, took the  disruption of his speech in stride.  </P> <P> "Now that we're all awake . . .," he joked to the 150 or so men and women who  had gathered for a seminar on pornography sponsored by the Southern California  Chapter of the Knights of Columbus.  </P> <P> Then, as the laughter subsided, Mahony told the group that they should "have  the spirit of compassion and forgiveness for those who see things differently  than we do."  </P> <P> "At the same time, I think it's important for us to stand by our convictions  and beliefs. A few shouts and voices are not about to deter me from the great  work which is ours still to do," the archbishop said.  </P> <P> Mahony has been the focus of several demonstrations protesting his stand that  chastity, rather than the use of condoms, is the only "morally correct and  medically secure way" to prevent the spread of AIDS.  </P> <P> On Dec. 3, four Roman Catholic churches in the Los Angeles area were spattered  with red paint, and posters of Mahony with the word "murderer" printed in large  letters were left at the church sites.  </P> <P> On Dec. 25, a group of about 10 demonstrators disrupted Mahony's sermon during  the midnight Christmas Mass at St. Vibiana's Cathedral, marching silently to  the altar in black T-shirts bearing a pink triangle and the slogan "Silence  Equals Death."  </P> <P> Saturday's action came as Mahony took the dais with Los Angeles County  Supervisor Mike Antonovich to present an award on behalf of the Knights of  Columbus to the Blockbuster Video chain for "its pro-family policies."  </P> <P> The chain, which has about 1,100 video stores nationwide, advertises itself as  "America's Family Video Store," and allows cardholders to restrict the kinds of  videos their minor children can check out. The store does not offer X-rated  videos and did not stock "The Last Temptation of Christ," the controversial  Oscar-nominated film depicting the life of Jesus Christ.  </P> <P> However, John Fall, another member of ACT-UP LA who led the picketing outside  the hotel, said the protest was unrelated to the award.  </P> <P> "We're not here on that," Fall said. "We're here to protest the church's  condemnation of safe sex and condoms, and its position on Operation Rescue," a  group opposing abortions that staged the Pacoima rally outside Her Clinic, a  women's health center on Van Nuys Boulevard.  </P> <P> Before the breakfast address, Fall broke into an informal press conference  Mahony was giving in the hotel lobby, shouting "You're a murderer, Mahony! Safe  sex saves lives!"  </P> <P> The action prompted hotel security officers to eject him from the hotel. But  afterward, Sbrizzi, dressed in a coat and tie, slipped into the meeting room  with Stuart Timmons of Silver Lake, Margie Eduardo of Valencia and Peter Siegel  of West Hollywood.  </P> <P> The four discreetly seated themselves at a back table with the editor of the  Knights' newsletter and his wife.  </P> <P> "We had no idea what they were going to do," said the editor, Charles Lyons, a  West Los Angeles Knight. "But I could tell they were pretty nervous, because  they were quiet and didn't talk to the rest of us.  </P> <P> Times staff writers Rose Ellen O'Connor, Amy Kazmin and Kristina Lindgren  contributed to this story.  </P></p>

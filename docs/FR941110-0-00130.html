			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We received comments suggesting that if an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allegation was found to be untrue, that accusation be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expunged from the nurse aide registry.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An allegation of resident abuse or neglect or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> misappropriation of resident property that is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantiated would not be entered on the nurse aide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> registry. Only a finding of resident abuse or neglect or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> misappropriation of resident property would be entered on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the nurse aide registry. Section 483.156(c)(1)(iv)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specifies the particular information that the registry must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contain with regard to any finding by the State survey  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency of abuse, neglect or misappropriation of property.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This information includes documentation of the State's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> investigation (including the nature of the allegation and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the evidence that led the State to conclude that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allegation was valid), the date of the hearing and its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> outcome (if a hearing was requested), and a statement by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual disputing the allegation (if the individual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chooses to make one). The rule also provides that this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information must be included in the registry within 10  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> working days of the finding and must remain in the registry  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permanently unless the finding was made in error, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual was found not guilty in a court of law, or the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State is notified of the individual's death.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We received several comments regarding the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nurse aide registry. Commenters offered suggestions for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contents of the registry, its availability to the public and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> action taken as a result of substantiation of abuse, neglect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or misappropriation of property.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter suggested that the report of findings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision include notifying the appropriate law enforcement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authorities in those cases where a crime has been committed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another commenter suggested that HCFA offer guidance to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities concerning the treatment of employees who are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> awaiting the resolution of a complaint.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These specific comments fall outside the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purview of this regulation on the survey, certification and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enforcement of skilled nursing facilities and nursing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities. However, a discussion of these and other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> related issues can be found in a final rule titled Medicare  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and Medicaid; Requirements for Long Term Care Facilities and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nurse Aide Training and Competency Evaluation Programs,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> published September 26, 1991 in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  at 56  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FR 48880.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters suggested that every  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> investigation seek to identify facility practices which led  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the neglect, abuse or misappropriation of resident  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> property.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

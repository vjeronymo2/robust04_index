			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / UK Company News: 3i share offer only just oversubscribed The public offer for 3i, the venture capital group, was only just oversubscribed - so 98 per cent of applicants will receive all the shares they sought. The Pounds 178m offer attracted 75,686 applications - well below the the 385,000 individual registrations for its prospectus. The offer period coincided with a flurry of flotations hitting the falling UK equity market. Baring Brothers, the issue's sponsor, said the public offer of 65.4m shares at 272p apiece was subscribed 1.1 times. Applicants for up to 3,000 shares will receive a full allocation. Those who sought 4,000 to 10,000 will receive 75 per cent, while applicants for 15,000 and above will receive 50 per cent - up to a maximum of 75,000 shares. The group's Pounds 522m institutional placement was 1.7 times subscribed, so there may be some demand when dealing starts on July 18 from institutions which want to top up their stake. With a market capitalisation of Pounds 1.58bn and stakes in more than 3,400 businesses, 3i is likely to join the FT-SE 100 Index. However, analysts believe the shares are unlikely to move to more than a modest premium - assuming the unsettled equity market does not plunge further in the meantime.</p>

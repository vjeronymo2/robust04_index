			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: No reason for OFT to probe loss leaders Sir, In their letter of December 14, Hugh Raven and Professor Tim Lang call for intervention by me to end the current 'price war' between the supermarkets. They cited price cutting on turkeys as a cause for concern. Price competition is very important to the consumer; without it, there would be fewer bargains to shop for, and fewer new products and services would get off the ground. Even where the competition takes the form of discounted prices, including loss leaders, I am therefore reluctant to intervene in the operation of the market without convincing evidence of collusive or otherwise clearly anti-competitive behaviour. I do not believe that loss leading on selected products - as opposed to uneconomic pricing of the whole range of product - can be expected to drive rivals out of business and reduce competition to the detriment of consumers. I therefore do not regard the facts reported in the letter as sufficient evidence to justify intervention, though my office continues to keep a close watch on developments in the retail grocery sector.

			<p><P> October 22, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNTERPUNCH: SOUTHWEST MUSEUM SHOULD REMAIN IN MT. WASHINGTON  </P> <P> The arrogance of the decision by the board of directors of the Southwest Museum  to move from its beautiful and significant site in Mt. Washington demonstrates  its ignorance of the history of museums and the various roles they play in  society. A museum is more than a collection of works of art. It is a point of  pride and self-definition for the community it serves, that very community  which serves it in return. Mt. Washington and Highland Park are culturally and  visually identified with the Southwest Museum while the museum is certainly  enhanced by its location.  </P> <P> It is, I emphasize, the arrogance of the board's decision -- not the decision  itself -- which is so deplorable. We, the general public and members alike,  learned unceremoniously of it through The Times. It was reported that storage  is inadequate, parking difficult, the building not earthquake-safe and that the  elevator is antiquated. Therefore, the article stated, the board assumed it was  obvious that this civic treasure must be transferred elsewhere.  </P> <P> Who, though, would ever believe in this day and age that it is cheaper to  purchase a large plot of land, erect a new state-of-the-art building and move a  whole institution than to remodel? No information has been released showing  that the finances have even been researched, let alone what the conclusions  might have been. We do know for sure that it is a more glamorous, dramatic and  exciting job for the board to raise money for a new building than it is to  raise money for repairs.  </P> <P> Despite all the problems, streams of schoolchildren climb that hill every day  to visit the superb collections, to see and study the Indian baskets, pots and  beads. Furthermore, membership is up and, with a sophisticated development  campaign, could soar even higher.  </P> <P> Could it possibly be that the neighborhoods of Mt. Washington and Highland  Park, with their diverse and often low-income populations, are not the  audiences the board wants for its parties and fund-raising events? Are these  neighborhoods frankly not chic enough?  </P> <P> One alternative to the radical decision to move the Southwest Museum would be  for the board to bring together an ad-hoc committee made up of residents,  students, teachers, artists, museum directors and journalists who love and  support the place. Mt. Washington and Highland Park are filled with such  people. The current director, not having any prior museum experience of his  own, probably would find the advice and expertise of these people refreshing  and insightful.  </P> <P> Together, the committee could brainstorm with the director, the staff and the  board. Together they might discover some creative (without doubt more moderate)  solutions than the arrogant one they have announced, which would cut the  cultural heart out of our community.  </P></p>

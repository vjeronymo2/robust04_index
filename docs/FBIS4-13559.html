			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Deputy Defense Minister Mordekhay Gur toured  Gush 'Etzyon regional council settlements today. Shilo Gal,  head of the regional council, presented to Gur a detailed plan  for the annexation of Gush 'Etzyon to Israeli territory in the  context of the permanent arrangement. Gur said the extent to  which such a plan conforms with the government's policy must be  checked. Our correspondent in the territories Golan Yokhpaz  reports:    [Begin recording] [Yokhpaz] Gal pointed to two large maps  on the wall. This is the Gush 'Etzyon area, he told Deputy  Defense Minister Gur. We hereby present to you the plan to link  Gush 'Etzyon to Israel's territory in the context of the  permanent arrangement, he said. [passage omitted]    Gal proposed to establish a settlement bloc in Gush 'Etzyon,  made up of two districts linked by a corridor, and link it to  Israel. For his part, Gur chose not to use the word annexation.  The plan must conform with the government's resolutions, he  said, and that is why I do not have a clear answer to give you.    [Gur] Nobody mentioned annexation, but talked about adding  settlements or expanding settlements with new neighborhoods,  each one of which could be considered a settlement. Therefore,  we must check very well how much this plan conforms with the  government's policy. [passage omitted] [end recording]</p>

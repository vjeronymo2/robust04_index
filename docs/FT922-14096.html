			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Election 1992: Message unclear amid the graffiti FROM ITS ill-lit walkways to its screeds of obscure graffiti, the Haverfield estate in London's Brentford is an archetypical concrete jungle. It houses more than 1,000 traditional - but often disillusioned  - Labour voters. The party's prospects of overturning the 7,953 Tory majority in Brentford and Isleworth may hang on whether these people can be bothered to vote. Labour needs a 7.8 per cent swing to take the largely middle-class constituency, held for the Tories by Sir Barney Hayhoe since 1974. Recent polls showing a movement towards Labour of between 7 per cent and 8 per cent in the capital suggest a close race. Against Labour's candidate, Ms Ann Keen, is the fact that much of the disillusionment on the estates is directed against the Labour-run council. The relatively well-heeled may be put off by the party's tax proposals. But, as elsewhere, tax and economic affairs in general have apparently failed to grab the voters' imagination. As Mr Nirj Deva, the Conservative candidate admits: 'The average voter is not particularly interested in economic matters.' This - and the spotlight on health as the contest's most important issue - may help Labour. All the more so as Mr Deva feels he has been hampered by 'the silly campaign they have been running' on the subject from Central Office. The party's failure to get its message across has left voters 'oblivious' to improvements in the NHS, he says. Sir Barney's retirement may also be beneficial to Labour. Mr Deva admits he has found the large number of public meetings 'hard going', but felt it was important to be present to ensure he was well-known to constituents. Labour has used canvass returns to target categories of voters with computer-printed letters. This has not been free from hitches: some floating voters have been irritated to be addressed as if they were Tory supporters. Confronted by well-financed rivals, Liberal Democrat Ms Janet Salmon and her dozen or so doughty helpers have concentrated on describing their party's policies to constituents face-to-face. 'We would certainly hope to do respectably,' she says.</p>

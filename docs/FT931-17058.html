			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / Finance and the Family: Small companies disappoint in '92 - At a glance 'A year of frustration and disappointment' is how analyst John Houilhan of Hoare Govett describes 1992, after small company shares underperformed for the fourth consecutive year. However, at least, small capitalisation stocks rallied over Christmas. The Hoare Govett index (capital gains version) rose 5.3 per cent from 1147.06 to 1208.87 between December 17 and December 30, while the County index climbed 5.5 per cent from 884.2 to 932.86 over the same period.</p>

			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Cantab in Dollars 5m private placing CANTAB Pharmaceuticals, the Cambridge-based biotechnology company which has a US quotation, has raised Dollars 5m (Pounds 3.3m) in a private placing to four institutional investors. The move, which broadens its shareholder base by three, follows a dialogue since the company floated in 1992. Mr Paul Haycock, chief executive, said: 'Our initial public offering in the US, when conditions were not ideal, was just 1m shares.' He said a number of institutions in the US had expressed a continuing appetite for the issue, which is traded on the Nasdaq market where many American biotech stocks are traded. Mr Haycock, who is understood to be considering floating Cantab on the Stock Exchange later this year or early next, said: 'The money will be used for the continuing development of our current products and the establishment and development of our portfolio for the future.' The company is developing products which use the properties of the immune system to treat disease. It is working on leucocyte modulators, which regulate or block immune system functions and therapeutic antigens, which activate specific immune responses.</p>

			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Eastern Germany in turmoil over agricultural counter-revolution - Conflicting claims are making land privatisation even more difficult than the authorities expected Mr Werner Loranz, who farms 1,300 hectares in the small village of Hohe Demzin in the eastern German state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, believes he is one of the gainers from German unification. Along with 14 other farmers who pooled their resources, he reclaimed or rented land from the Treuhand privatisation agency, and even managed to secure a 12-year lease in the process. Once the lease has expired, and assuming there are no outstanding property claims, Mr Loranz will have an option to buy the land at a preferential price. 'Things are going fine,' says the 39-year-old farmer who until 1990, worked on the giant 6,000 hectare co-operative farm, parts of which were placed under the Treuhand after German unification in 1990. 'We have no debts. We made a turnover of DM1.5m (Pounds 590,000) last year. But I must tell you that we are one of the lucky ones. Other farmers are in great difficulties'. Officials from Germany's agricultural ministry agree. 'The restructuring and privatisation of land in eastern Germany has proven to be one of the most difficult processes the Treuhand has had to face,' says Mr Otto Bammell, a senior expert at the ministry. 'Actually, I do not think the turmoil has yet ended.' The turmoil started when the Treuhand, with two aims in mind, set about privatising 1.2m hectares of east German land in 1990. It first wanted to restructure east German agriculture, which entailed breaking up the Landwirtschaftliche Produktionsgenossenschaften, or LPGs, the large co-operatives, and the Volkseigene Guer, or VEGs, the state farms, and then wanted to sell the land. In the early days of unification, the agency started selling agricultural land. But most of the buyers were coming from western Germany. 'The east Germans felt they were being colonised. They had no chance to buy land because they had no money. There was terrible tension in the countryside. We decided we had to give the easterners a chance. So we introduced the system of leasing land at preferential rates to the easterners,' explains Mr Bammell. Yet even leasing land posed enormous problems for the Treuhand largely because of property rights. Under the terms of the unification treaty, former Nazi victims and those whose land was confiscated by the Nazis have full rights of restitution and compensation. These rights also apply to former land owners whose land was confiscated by the communists between 1949 and 1990. This meant that when the Treuhand wanted to lease land to east (or west) Germans, it had to make sure that there were no outstanding claims on the property. 'In some cases, the east Germans complained that they received only short-term contracts of about three years, compared to some west Germans who managed to obtain 12-year contracts,' says Mr Bammell. 'The problem facing the agency was that it was afraid to extend long contracts in case former property owners had already put in a claim. What could the Treuhand do with an east German long-term leaseholder if a former owner wanted to come back?' It was often difficult to ascertain who originally owned the land. Take the case of the LPGs. These co-operative farms were created from land expropriated by the former Soviet Union, which ruled East Germany between 1945 and 1949, and from small East German landholders who in 1952 were forced to place their plots in the LPGs. Often, the original land register was closed and a new one opened that stipulated the LPG was owned by the state. The Treuhand is now discovering, however, that former owners or their descendants have found the original land registers and are claiming back their land. 'This has inevitably slowed down the whole process of leasing land,' says Mr Bammell. 'If land has been leased by the Treuhand, even for a short time, and if the former owner could prove legal title to it, the Treuhand can allow the lease to run its full term, but once it has expired it must reimburse the original owner of the rent paid to the agency from the leaseholder.' This sense of uncertainty about who owns land in eastern Germany, and the delay in drawing up water-tight contracts, has been compounded by another factor: the former land owners, usually belonging to the Prussian aristocracy, whose land was expropriated by the Soviet administration between 1945 and 1949. These owners have no right of restitution, but they do have a right to buy back their land, rent it, or, following a law passed last month, receive limited compensation, or buy a certain amount of property in eastern Germany at preferential rates. 'After unification, these former large landowners hesitated about buying back their property and instead leased land in eastern Germany. They were waiting to see what kind of compensation law would be agreed,' explains Mr Bammell. But in the process, the privatisation - and investment in east German agriculture - was delayed. Eastern German farmers, such as Mr Loranz, resent the fact that these former landowners can return and buy or rent land at preferential prices. 'But it's not only that which upsets me,' he stresses. 'These owners have managed to obtain long-term contracts unlike many of east Germans who had to fight hard even to get a short-term lease. And in some cases, they do not even come back to farm the land themselves. It is very unfair.' Even more unfair, according to east German farmers, is the fact that those wishing to buy land in eastern Germany can circumvent outstanding property claims held by eastern Germans if they can prove to the Treuhand that they will invest and create jobs. In which case, a former landowner can only get back the land if he or she can match that investment plan. 'The east Germans simply do not have the money to compete with the west Germans,' complains Mr Loranz. Ministry officials argue, however, that incentives for investors were a crucial instrument for reviving eastern German agriculture. In spite of the scale of these problems, the Treuhand is in the process of drawing up 9,000 contracts, which involves leasing 90,000 hectares on short-term contracts and about 788,000 on long-term contracts. 'East German agriculture is slowly stabilising,' says Mr Bammell. 'But we have paid a high price for ending the turmoil and creating a propertied class.'</p>

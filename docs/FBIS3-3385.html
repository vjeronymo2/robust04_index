			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Xu Xingtang (1776 5281 1016), and Wu Yilong </F> (1566 0076 7893)]    [Text] Beijing, 18 Mar (XINHUA) -- Qiao Shi, member of the  CPC Central Committee Political Bureau Standing Committee and  chairman of the National People's Congress [NPC] Standing  Committee, visited the NPC deputies from Fujian and Xinjiang at  the Great Hall of the People this morning.    Meeting with the deputies from Fujian, Qiao Shi said: With  the Xiamen Special Economic Zone, Fujian is at the forefront of  reform and opening up. The discussion of giving Xiamen  legislative power is part of the NPC agenda. Fujian's  development has been quite fast since the adoption of the policy  of reform and opening up, especially in recent years. While the  fast growth can be attributed to the policy, it can also be  attributed to the hard work of people in Fujian. Fujian not  only has made substantial headway in opening up to the outside  world, but also in developing relations with overseas Chinese  and countrymen in Taiwan, and you have also attached importance  to intensifying material and spiritual construction in the  province.    Qiao Shi expressed the hope that Fujian will achieve even  greater success under the leadership of the provincial party  committee and the provincial government.    On assisting the poor, Qiao Shi said: Fujian is a historical  revolutionary bastion. Fifteen months after the Jinggangshan  resolutionary base [in Jiangxi] was established, Chairman Mao  came down from the mountain and visited western Fujian. In  helping the poverty-stricken areas, the central government has  been giving preferential treatment to central and western China  and has given Fujian the assignment of supporting western Fujian  and other poverty-stricken areas in the province. It is hoped  that Fujian, while promoting coastal areas' economic  development, will also work with determination to build up  western Fuijian and other historical and mountainous areas in  accordance with the central government's requirement that areas  which have become affluent first should help impoverished areas  achieve prosperity. Historical areas are unlikely to improve  without outside assistance. The central government has  deliberately given Fujian this assignment so that aid-the-poor  programs will be successful nationwide. The central government  will have problems if it has to shoulder all the aid-the-poor  programs alone. I hope you will make a success of this project.    While meeting the deputies from Xinjiang, Qiao Shi said:  Xinjiang is the largest and strategically important region in  western China. In recent years Xinjiang has made substantial  progress in promoting industrial and other developments as well  as in promoting agricultural production and animal husbandry.  Of course, Xinjiang's economic development still lags behind  that in coastal areas for historical reasons. From now on,  Xinjiang must think of some ways to develop itself in various  fields. Xinjiang, a region where minority nationalities live in  compact communities, has been quite successful in promoting  national solidarity. I hope Xinjiang will continue to  strengthen and consolidate the solidarity among people of all  nationalities and build up Xinjiang on this basis.    Commenting on relations with neighboring countries, Qiao Shi  said: Xinjiang is a neighbor of Central Asian countries. We  should develop friendly, equal, and mutually beneficial  cooperation with them on the basis of the five principles of  peaceful coexistence. While this is very important for  maintaining national stability and creating a good international  environment for modernization, it is also helpful for  strengthening the solidarity among people of all nationalities  and for safeguarding national unity. In this regard, people of  all nationalities in Xinjiang have a very important mission to  accomplish.    Qiao Shi said: Xinjiang also has relatively rich natural  resources. In addition to coal, it also has considerable oil  reserves and other natural resources. Of course, Xinjiang also  has its developmental problems, but these problems can be  gradually resolved during the course of reform.    Qiao Shi said: "I wholeheartedly hope people of all  nationalities in Xinjiang will unite more closely, work together  in carrying out the task of building Xinjiang, and build  Xinjiang into an even better place."    Qiao Shi also hoped the current NPC session would further  unite people in Xinjiang, boost their morale, and encourage them  to do an even better job in all areas.    The NPC deputies from Fujian and Xinjiang pledged that they  certainly will expedite economic construction and national  solidarity according to the plan drawn up by the party central  committee.</p>

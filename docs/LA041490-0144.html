			<p><P> April 14, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SURFING AT HUNTINGTON BEACH;  </P> <P> RAPPING RIDER COLBY OUTLAW MOVES AT SEA AND ON SHORE  </P> <P> Take a hike, M.C. Hammer. Bust a move, Young M.C. It's time to make room for  Colby Outlaw, the rapping surfer from Huntington Beach.  </P> <P> In a sport filled with charismatic characters, Outlaw can surf, and rap, with  the best. Whether he's catching a tasty wave or finding time to rhyme, Outlaw  has one rule -- be original.  </P> <P> "My image is to not portray anything or anyone," Outlaw said. "I'm always in  the limelight and I'm really energetic. I think God gives each of us a gift.  Some get the gift of gab. Some get other gifts."  </P> <P> Outlaw, 20, certainly has the gift of gab, and he's not afraid to use it.  </P> <P> He and his surfing pal, Solo Scott, did their rap routines for anyone within  earshot Friday at the Easter Surfing Classic at Bolsa Chica State Beach. Most  of their lyrics are unprintable, but clever nonetheless.  </P> <P> "Colby's a party animal," said surfer Anthony Ruffo of Santa Cruz. "He's really  fun. He's a great rapper. He's a crowd favorite."  </P> <P> During a stop on the Professional Surfing Assn. of America tour in Puerto Rico  earlier this year, Outlaw jammed with a local band.  </P> <P> "He jumped up on the stage and grabbed the mike," Ruffo said. "He was great."  </P> <P> But Outlaw said his rap career probably won't go much further than the beach.  </P> <P> "I do it for fun," he said. "It's entertainment. I used to do a lot of dancing  -- soul, breaking and popping -- then I got into rap. I love all kinds of  music: reggae, rock, punk."  </P> <P> Outlaw developed a knack for rhymes at a young age.  </P> <P> "When I was a little kid, I used to write a lot of poetry," he said. "Once I  get going . . . I can really rip it off."  </P> <P> The words come as naturally as surfing for Outlaw, who was one of eight Orange  County competitors who won fourth-round qualifying heats Friday. They advanced,  along with the second-place finishers, to today's fifth round against the top  32 seeded surfers. The quarterfinals, semifinals and finals are scheduled for  Sunday.  </P> <P> Outlaw wasted little time Friday showing why he is ranked No. 16 in the PSAA  rankings. He carved the open face of each wave like an Easter ham, even buzzing  by an unsuspecting bodyboarder who had wandered into the competition area.  </P> <P> "His surfing is really quick and agile, kind of abrupt," said surfer Garth  Tarlow of Fullerton. "He's got a lot of room to grow, but he should be a big  name."  </P> <P> And big names surf with the world tour. With a finish in the top 16 on the PSAA  tour, Outlaw could get a shot at the major leagues of surfing.  </P> <P> "I'm only 20 years old and I might give the world tour a try in a couple of  years," said Outlaw, a 1988 graduate of Huntington Beach High School. "It's  hard because you have to travel all over with the tour, but it would be fun."  </P> <P> Outlaw certainly fits the surfer look. He's muscular and tan with sandy blond  hair and a ready grin.  </P> <P> But Outlaw is careful not to let his image overstep its bounds. He said he is  concerned that surfers are characterized as trouble-making fools.  </P> <P> "I think that portrayed the surfer image of the 1970s," Outlaw said. "It was  all long hair and smoking dope, you know. That image sold in the 1970s and  '80s, but now surfers are taking the sport seriously. We're athletes."  </P> <P> And with the surf as his turf, Outlaw approaches life with a freewheeling  perspective.  </P> <P> Tarlow knows.  </P> <P> "His last name kind of says it all," Tarlow said. "He's the Outlaw."  </P> <P> Friday's results:  </P> <P> Fourth Round  </P> <P> (Top two advance to fifth round)  </P> <P> Heat 1 -- Danny Melhado, Indialantic, Fla.; Justin Poston, San Diego.

			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / International Company News: New head of finance appointed at Qantas Qantas, the government-controlled Australian airline in which British Airways holds a minority stake, yesterday announced that Mr Gary Toomey had been appointed chief financial officer with effect from December 1. He will also be appointed a director, filling one of two vacant positions on the board, where British Airways holds three seats. Mr Toomey's appointment follows the departure of Mr Graham Jones, former finance director, who resigned in September after only 11 months with Qantas. According to industry sources, Mr Jones 'felt he could not make the required commitment to Qantas to stay on for at a further three to five years, encompassing the float and consequent bedding-down process'. The government plans to sell its remaining holding in Qantas, although this step has now been pushed back to 1995. Mr Toomey's appointment is the latest in a series of senior management changes at Qantas. It means that all three top executive positions are now held by people previously connected with Australian Airlines, the large domestic carrier which merged with Qantas last year. Mr Toomey was chief financial executive of Australian from 1987 to 1992, when he moved to become chief financial officer of Arnotts, the food group. Aged 38, he is an accountant by training, having worked in the 1970s for Peat Marwick Mitchell and Parkhill, Lithgow and Gibson.</p>

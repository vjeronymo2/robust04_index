			<p>BFN     [Text] Shenzhen, May 19 (CNS) -- The "Asia No.2" satellite  is scheduled to be launched in the first quarter next year and  most of 33 transmitters installed in the satellite have been  hired in advance by clients, according to a conference held by  the Asia Satellite Limited Company in Shenzhen.    The regional satellite mainly for commercial communications  in Asia will be launched by the China Great Wall Industrial  Company in Xichang. About half of the transmitters already  hired will be used for television broadcasting while the rest  will be employed in communications.    This satellite is so far the largest commercial one with the  greatest power in Asia while it is also the world's largest and  most advanced communications satellite operated in a static  orbit. The satellite will cover a wide area starting in Tokyo  in the east, stretching to the Mediterranean Sea in the west, to  the Commonwealth of Independent States in the north and to New  Zealand in the south. The total population is put at 3.3 billion  in the region covered by the satellite, making up 63 percent of  the world population. It is expected that life expectancy for  the satellite is as long as 15 years.    The Asia Satellite Limited Company has begun preparatory  work  for the launching of the "Asia No. 3" satellite.</p>

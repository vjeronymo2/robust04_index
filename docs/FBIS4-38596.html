			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anatoly Kholodyuk] </F>   [Text] Sevastopol May 31 TASS -- The naval radar system  near the Ukrainian Black Sea Port of Odessa will cease to  operate Wednesday as the Black Sea Fleet command refused to  share it with Ukrainian Navy authorities.    Spokesman for the Ukrainian Navy Oleg Chubuk told TASS on  Tuesday that the radar stops functioning because "the Black Sea  Fleet has not expressed readiness to cooperate with the  Ukrainian Navy in running the facility and exchanging data  monitored in the north-western part of the Black Sea".    According to the source, the fleet command has twice ignored  Ukrainian messages requesting such cooperation.    The Black Sea Fleet operates a network of radars called  "Mars", one of which is located near Odessa.    Tensions between the Ukrainian and Black Sea Navies flared  up  last month when radar equipment was transferred from Odessa to  the fleet's main base in Sevastopol without Ukrainian consent.</p>

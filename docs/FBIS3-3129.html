Joining deputies from Shanxi Province in a discussion during  the current session of the National People's Congress, Li said  that Shanxi has played and will continue to play an important  role in the national economic development.    He noted that Shanxi supplies over 200 million tons of coal  to other parts of China each year.    Coal mines run by townships and villages produce over half  of  the provincial coal output. The small coal mines have made  contributions to the nation. "It is necessary to support small  coal mines, accelerate their technical upgrading, strengthen  their safe production and turn them into modernized or  semi-modernized enterprises," he said.    On difficulties of state-owned enterprises, he said that  solving problems of major state-owned enterprises is a vital but  difficult issue in the current reform. The central authorities  have decided to make continuous investigations in and study on  this issue, which cannot be solved in one or two years or by  adopting merely the joint-stock system. The invigoration of  state-owned enterprises will depend mainly on technical progress  and the production of marketable goods.    He also talked about building water conservancy projects to  solve water shortages in Shanxi and about assisting the  province's poor areas to develop their economies.</p>

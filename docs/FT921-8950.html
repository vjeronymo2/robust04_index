			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / Appointments: Supply and demand Andrew Bogle has joined British Gas as head of supply and demand management, from Cookson, the industrial materials group, where he was strategic planning manager. Bogle's role of monitoring short-term gas supply and planning for the longer term is even more pressing in today's climate of tight gas supplies. British Gas recently warned of severe shortages by 1994, although the government's decision last month to allow gas imports could alleviate that problem.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Riyadh, April 23 (AFP) -- Gulf Arab states have  reservations about a U.S. document calling on them to encourage  pluralism and democracy as the basis of future relations in the  Middle East, Arab diplomats said here Saturday.    The document, presented to the six-nation Gulf Cooperation  Council (GCC) in February, said the United States wanted to see  participants in the multilateral Middle East peace talks  "encourage individual and collective freedoms and pursue  democracy and pluralism."    It said relations between states in the region should be  based on such concepts in the future.    Foreign Ministry officials from GCC members Saudi Arabia,  Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain and Oman met in  Riyadh Saturday to discuss the document. They had  "reservations" about the proposals, the diplomats said.    The ministry officials were to coordinate their positions on  the document and review their participation in the multilateral  talks, launched at the Madrid peace conference in 1991.    Of the six GCC states only Kuwait has a freely elected  parliament with various political groups represented.    The other five have specially-appointed consultative  assemblies.    On Tuesday the multilateral working group on water resources  -- one of five set up in Madrid -- ended talks in Oman with  agreements on five projects to boost scarce water supplies and  establish Israeli-Arab cooperation.    The talks were attended by an Israeli delegation, visiting a  Gulf Arab country for the first time ever.    Qatar is due to host a meeting of the working group on  disarmament from May 2 to 5.    The other three groups deal with economic cooperation,  refugees and the environment.</p>

			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / Seabed mining rules approved The UN General Assembly voted yesterday to amend the Law of the Sea convention to meet industrialised countries' objections to its seabed mining rules, Michael Littlejohns reports from New York. The treaty will come into force in November. As a result of the changes, the US, Britain, Germany, Japan and other industrialised states are expected to sign it today. They claimed the original seabed mining provisions were cumbersome, restrictive and inimical to private enterprise. Changes in the treaty apply clear free-market principles to seabed exploitation and protect mineral producers and investors. But the special interests of poor developing countries are still recognised. The treaty also allows states to create a 12-mile territorial sea limit and a 200-mile exclusive economic zone. The US and Britain are still worried by the cost of new institutions to be set up, including an International Seabed Authority.</p>

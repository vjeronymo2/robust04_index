			<p><P> April 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: DOWNEY;  </P> <P> RECYCLING SYSTEM EXPANDED TO INCLUDE PLASTIC BOTTLES  </P> <P> Downey is expanding its residential recycling program to accept plastic soft  drink and mineral water bottles in addition to glass, newspapers and aluminum  cans. The city will start accepting the plastic bottles Monday, recycling  coordinator Kathy Simmons said.  </P> <P> Downey started its recycling program for residents of single-family homes in  1976. Participants are provided with a 32-gallon barrel at no cost to store the  refuse, which is picked up every other week.  </P> <P> About 6,000 of the city's 24,000 single-family residences participate in the  program, Simmons said. A recruitment drive will be held this weekend to try to  boost program participation to 50% or 60%, she said.  </P></p>

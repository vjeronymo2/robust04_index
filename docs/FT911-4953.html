			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / Observer: Gear change Is Edsel Ford II still in the running to head the famous company founded by his great-grandfather Henry? Members of the Ford family continue to clamber through the lower echelons of America's second biggest carmaker - for example, William Ford was made executive director of business strategy last month - but Edsel is out in front. Now 42, and having joined the company in 1974, he has done more than a dozen different jobs before being just made president of Ford Motor Credit, the world's second largest finance company. A couple of years ago young Edsel was complaining bitterly that Donald Petersen, Ford's non-family chairman, was excluding him from the influential committees on the company's board. Since then, however, he has been keeping his head down, and a stint on the finance side is bound to increase his chance of a shot at the topmost job.</p>

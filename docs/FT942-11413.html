			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / FT Exporter (8): Expanding in all directions - While Jordan's leading pharmaceuticals manufacturer has ambitious plans for its international network, its regional roots have not been neglected / Company profile, Al-Hikmat 'By the year 2000 we want to be a genuine multinational', says Al-Hikmat Pharmaceutical Vice-President Ali Al-Husry. The company, Jordan's leading pharmaceuticals manufacturer, is certainly making the right moves to reach its goal. Al-Hikmat Pharmaceuticals has been export-oriented since its establishment in Amman in 1971 and about 70 per cent of its production, which includes a full range of prescription and over-the-counter medicines, has gone both to regional markets and further afield to Africa, the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe. It is in the top 15 suppliers to the rich and highly competitive Saudi Arabian market and maintains representative offices in Moscow, Bratislava, Beijing, Tunis and Cairo. Exports in 1993 reached Dollars 41m, close to two-thirds of Jordan's total pharmaceutical exports of Dollars 68m. However, Mr Al-Husry says that by the late 1980s, the company had realised that to maintain growth, it needed to expand its vision and find its way into western markets in Europe, the US and Japan. Its chosen approach was through the establishment of a physical presence rather than just a market share. Portugal is the entry point for the European Union and Al-Hikmat's 60,000 sq m plant outside Lisbon began production of injectibles in September 1993. The company is now setting up a marketing network in Europe which includes a mixture of representative offices and joint ventures, both with distributors and with manufacturers whose products complement their own. EU and Federal Drugs Authority requirements were built into the plant's design and the company hopes to begin exporting to the US by late 1994 or early 1995. Al-Hikmat moved into the US market in 1990 with the purchase of New Jersey-based generic specialist West-Ward. West-Ward is being developed as the US marketing arm of Al-Hikmat's plants in Portugal and Jordan and will also sell into Al-Hikmat markets outside the US. In its moves to new markets, the company has not lost sight of its regional roots. It has a manufacturing agreement with the Kahira Pharmaceutical and Chemical Industries Company under which it is providing technical support for the manufacturing and marketing of selected products in Egypt, the largest single market in the Arab world. In Tunisia, a joint venture of Al-Hikmat Investments, now the parent company of all Al-Hikmat subsidiaries, and 1bn Al-Baytar of Tunisia, set up in 1993, will produce cephalosporins and penicillin under the Al-Hikmat name for sale in all the French-speaking markets of Africa. A third joint venture, to be located in Saudi Arabia, is now under development and with prospects for a revival in West Bank industry improving, the company is looking for co-operation with its pharmaceutical sector. At home, Al-Hikmat's emphasis is on vertical expansion. Al-Hikmat Chem was established in 1980 to produce raw materials for Beta lactam antibiotics and cephalosporins. With the purchase of a majority share in Arab medical containers in 1989, the company started producing health-care related plastics, including polyethylene and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) bottles. Next will be the establishment of a company to carry out bio-equivalency studies, both for its own products and for other Jordanian and regional manufacturers. Mr Al-Husry says that the rapid expansion in local pharmaceutical manufacturing capacity - Jordan has five established companies and seven under development - is making such ventures increasingly attractive. He believes that Al-Hikmat now has all the elements in place for a major expansion. Al-Hikmat Investment's turnover in 1993 was Dollars 60m. 'Within two years it should jump to Dollars 100m,' he says.</p>

			<p><P> October 17, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VALLEY ROUNDUP: IMPERIAL ENDS BID TO BUY 5 VALLEY FEDERAL BRANCHES  </P> <P> Valley Federal Savings &amp; Loan, a Van Nuys-based thrift, said Imperial Corp.  of America withdrew its application to buy five Valley Federal branch offices  in the San Joaquin Valley.  </P> <P> Imperial, the San Diego-based parent of Imperial Savings &amp; Loan, withdrew  its application from the federal Office of Thrift Supervision because Imperial  Savings is not yet in compliance with certain requirements of the Community  Reinvestment Act, said Imperial spokesman Tim Larrick.  </P> <P> The act requires S&amp;Ls to lend money in amounts related to areas where  deposits are received. Imperial is taking steps to meet the criteria under the  act, and it might resubmit its application to buy the Valley Federal branches,  Imperial said.  </P> <P> The proposed sale was first announced in August. Terms were not disclosed, but  Valley Federal said the sale would enable it to save about $2 million per year  in operating costs.  </P></p>

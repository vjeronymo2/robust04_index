			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Clinton admits mistakes in handling foreign policy: President hits back at criticism from western Europe US PRESIDENT Bill Clinton and Mr Warren Christopher, his secretary of state, conceded over the weekend that their conduct of foreign policy had not been free of error, especially in Somalia. But both, in interviews with the Washington Post, resisted suggestions that the administration's foreign policy team needed shaking up or that the president should reduce his concentration on domestic issues. Both also had harsh words for western Europe. On Bosnia, for example, Mr Clinton observed: 'I had the feeling that the British and the French felt it was far more important to avoid lifting the arms embargo than to save the country.' The president disclosed that Mr John Major told him his government could fall if he agreed to US demands to lift the embargo and launch air strikes against the Serbs. 'John Major told me he wasn't sure he could sustain his government if he approved the plan,' Mr Clinton said. Mr Christopher responded sharply to an editorial in last week's Economist magazine calling for his removal also by citing Bosnia. Such 'blame America' rhetoric, he said, stemmed from the US 'not having resolved the problem that Europe failed to resolve itself'. He said he thought official Washington had been for too long too 'Eurocentric' and that 'western Europe is no longer the dominant area of the world . . . there is a lot of criticism coming from western Europe but I don't see or hear it coming from Asia'. Mr Clinton noted three areas where the US foreign policy record might have been better: failing to engage the American public more in explaining the US role in the post-cold war world, allowing US soldiers to serve under UN command and letting diplomatic efforts in Somalia languish over the summer. Mr Christopher said it was 'probably an error' not to have reviewed US policy in Somalia when UN peacekeepers began getting killed. In fact the State Department is so unhappy with the performance of Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, that it is trying to dissuade him from visiting Somalia this week as planned. It fears his presence might jeopardise the fragile ceasefire between the UN and the forces of General Mohammed Farah Aideed. Although in a self-critical mood, Mr Clinton doubted that a more intense 'national dialogue' in foreign policy would necessarily have made any difference. 'I don't think you can ever say . . . looking objectively at the problems of people in this country, that we could be more successful in foreign affairs if we talked about it more, to the exclusion of domestic efforts,' he said.

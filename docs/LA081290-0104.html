			<p><P> August 12, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> POTENTIAL INDUCTEES FORM A LONG LIST  </P> <P> Now that Jim Palmer and Joe Morgan are officially in the Hall of Fame, the  question becomes: Who's next in line for baseball immortality?  </P> <P> The qualifications for a spot in Cooperstown have become a sticky subject  lately. Some say the standards have softened, and the game's all-time greats  just aren't as great as they used to be.  </P> <P> The formation of a veterans committee has allowed players to sneak in who  couldn't get by the writers after 15 years.  </P> <P> The writers would prefer the veterans committee limit its selections to  umpires, front office types and members of the Negro Leagues who were denied a  shot at the major leagues.  </P> <P> Palmer won 268 games and made it in his first year of eligibility. Gaylord  Perry totaled 314 victories (265 losses) and was squeezed out in his first two  years on the ballot.  </P> <P> "Am I as good as Cy Young? Of course not. Am I as good as some of the pitchers  in the Hall of Fame," Palmer said. "Probably not. But I would have voted for  myself. It's nice to be part of that ilk."  </P> <P> Two years ago, Jim Bunning missed by four votes because nine writers left their  ballots blank in a statement of some sort.  </P> <P> It was once thought that 300 victories was an automatic invitation to the Hall  of Fame, along with 500 home runs, 3,000 hits and 3,000 strikeouts.  </P> <P> "Jim Palmer deserved to go to the Hall of Fame," Perry said. "But looking at  his record, some other people like Ferguson Jenkins and Jim Bunning should get  in, too."  </P> <P> Perry staggered his way to 300 wins, bouncing from one team to another in an  effort to hang on. There's also the problem of his use of the greaseball. Some  voters consider it a form of treason.  </P> <P> When the voting is announced in January 1991, it seems likely Rod Carew will  make it on his first try because of his 3,053 hits and .328 lifetime average.  </P> <P> Rollie Fingers, baseball's all-time save leader with 341, will also appear on  the ballot for the first time. His standing with the writers will be an  indication of the chances for Bruce Sutter, Sparky Lyle and Rich Gossage.  </P> <P> Then, there's the guys who have come close the last few years like Perry,  Jenkins (284-226, 3,192 strikeouts) and Bunning (224-184, no-hitters in each  league).  </P> <P> "The Hall of Fame doesn't mean as much to me now," Perry said. "The first year  I was really anticipating something. Now, it will be nice if I get in but it's  not something I'm thinking about."  </P> <P> If Perry fails the next couple of years, he may never get in because the field  will be so strong for the rest of the decade.  </P> <P> On deck as potential Hall of Famers are Tom Seaver, Don Sutton, Steve Carlton,  Nolan Ryan, Reggie Jackson, Mike Schmidt, Carlton Fisk, Tommy John, Gary  Carter, Bert Blyleven, Ozzie Smith, Tony Perez, George Brett, Wade Boggs,  Rickey Henderson, Robin Yount, Dale Murphy, Dave Winfield, Jim Rice, Bob Boone  and Dave Parker.  </P> <P> It seems a lock that Seaver, Carlton, Ryan, Jackson, Schmidt, Fisk, Brett,  Boggs and Henderson will make it when first eligible.  </P> <P> Then, of course, there is Pete Rose. Until his banishment from baseball last  August and jail sentence last month, baseball's all-time hit leader figured to  achieve one of the highest voting percentages in history when eligible in 1992,  along with Seaver.  </P> <P> But several voting members of the Baseball Writers Association of America are  undecided on whether Rose merits induction on his first try -- if ever.  </P> <P> "He's lost just about everything he's had," Morgan said. "The question is: Is  he going to lose his Hall of Fame seat?  </P> <P> "It's up to the writers to decide. I didn't know how you voted until after I  was voted in," he said. "Integrity, character, ability and contribtions to the  team. In a couple of those areas I don't think there's any question about Pete  Rose. A couple you can question. The point is how much weight does each one  carry."  </P></p>

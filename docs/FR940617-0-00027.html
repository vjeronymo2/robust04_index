			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section 7: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Two commenters remarked that a buy back option should be allowed for infringement of intellectual property rights.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Such a provision would give the Bidder the right simply to ``buy back'' equipment or software when a copyright problem is encountered. To the Owner, this means that essential features or capability could be lost and would remain unavailable for the entire useful life of the new switching equipment. The resulting reduction in value of the Contract to the Owner cannot be predicted, and often would be greater than the amount the Owner paid for the price of the infringing equipment or software.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section 7: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter remarked that this Section should be limited to United States patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  REA believes this would not provide sufficient protection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section 7: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter remarked that the Bidder should be allowed to take pro-active steps to avoid an injunction, rather than always having to react to an injunction after it is imposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  This section merely states the action the Bidder must take to protect the Owner after the use of the equipment or software is enjoined. It does not proscribe any action the Bidder may wish to take to protect its own interests and the Owner's interests before the injunction is granted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Article V, Remedies <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section 2: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Three commenters remarked that the cap on liquidated damages is excessive and unrelated to any actual damage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  REA believes that if a limit is to be set it should not be less than the price of the affected central office and all associated remote switching units. This in many cases will be less than the total Contract price. This Section also instructs the Owner to notify the Bidder in writing how the liquidated damages were computed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section 2: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter remarked that previous draft versions of the 525 Central Office Equipment Contract better defined ``placed in service'' and assumes liquidated damages are applied based on that date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  REA believes that the wording ``used by the Owner to earn revenue'' more clearly defines ``placed in service.'' Article V, sections 2 and 5, and Article VII, section 1, Definitions, clearly state that liquidated damages can only be assessed and are the exclusive remedy when the Bidder has failed to complete the Project on time and are not based on when a central office is placed in service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section 2: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter remarked that the Bidder should not be assessed liquidated damages based on the entire Project when a only a portion is delayed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  As stated previously, the central office and all associated remote switching terminals are a unit for the purposes of this Contract. Liquidated damages are measured from ``Completion of Project.'' This gives the Bidder an incentive to complete the Project in a timely manner. If liquidated damages were assessed on each individual part of a Project, then in some cases the incentive to finish the Project on time would be removed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section 2: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter remarked that liquidated damages should not apply to features or capabilities that are not fully developed or do not have a verifiable satisfactory field performance because they have been accepted by the Owner and by definition they are unproven. It was also felt that even if they are not exempt, liquidated damages should not apply if the central office has been placed in service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Owner allowed these unproven features to be bid based on a time period established by the Bidder for the availability of these features. A Bidder's responsibility to provide the features or capabilities bid on, in the time period established by the Bidder, cannot be diminished by notifying the Owner that they are not going to be available in the time promised. The language in Article V, section 2, remains.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Liquidated damages on unproven features are a measure of revenue that would be lost by that feature not being available on time. It does not have a bearing on, and should not be associated with, revenue from the rest of the Project that is in service. If it was as suggested in the comment, then it would be a penalty to the Owner in lost revenue for the Bidder not completing the feature or capability as scheduled.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section 2: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter remarked that additional language be added after the word ``Provided,'' to clarify this provision. It was also felt that the last line of this section seemed inappropriate and should be deleted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

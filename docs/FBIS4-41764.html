			<p>BFN     [Text] Baku (June 27) TURAN -- "During yesterday talk in  our embassy with Russia's special envoy Vladimir Kazimirov we  discussed issues concerning the settlement of Armenian-Azeri  conflict" TURAN was told by Altan Karamanoglu, Turkish envoy in  Azerbaijan.    Karamanoglu said, that during the conversation Kazimirov  expressed his wish to visit Turkey. According to Karamanoglu,  Kazimirov leaves for Ankara tomorrow by "Azal" airline flight.  A working program of Kazimirov's visit to Turkey was also  discussed. Karamanoglu said that Russian envoy will meet with  Turkey Foreign Ministry's experts in Ankara.    Today Kazimirov has returned from Yerevan to Baku.  "Presently, he tries to agree CSCE and Russia's plans into a  single plan. We know that Azerbaijan wishes to settle the  Karabakh conflict within the CSCE framework", said Karamanoglu.    Kazimirov's intentions to consult with Iran and Turkey was  explained by Karamanoglu as "realising the fact that the  solution of the problem will be possible only within the CSCE  framework".    "Though Iran is not a member of CSCE, participation in the  process of such countries as Russia, Iran and Turkey is  avoidable", said Karamanoglu. [sentence as received]</p>

			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / Arts: Today's Television Everything happens at nine o'clock. BBC2 shows the first in its two part drama by Simon Gray, Unnatural Pursuits. Described as a 'musical comic fantasy', it has an impressive credit list beginning with its star, Alan Bates, who plays heavy drinking, chain-smoking playwright Hamish Partt. The director is Christopher Morahan, who moves easily between live theatre and television, and the producer Kenith Trodd, responsible for many of the BBC's best original dramas in the last 20 years. ITV screens the first episode of its 3-part Victorian murder mystery The Blackheath Poisonings, adapted by Simon Raven from Julian Symons's novel. This has a cast including Zoe Wanamaker, Judy Parfitt, Patrick Malahide, Ronald Fraser, and Kenneth Haigh. C4's often excellent documentary series Cutting Edge offers a programme investigating allegations of malpractice in Broadmoor. The same series produced the programme last year about Ashworth in Merseyside which led to the Blom-Cooper inquiry. I shall watch BBC2, tape ITV, and wait for the repeat of the C4 documentary on Friday.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OSHA has carefully considered these comments. OSHA understands that in cold weather employees must be able to warm their hands and feet to prevent frostbite and to maintain proper grip of tools. However, OSHA believes that the use of a flammable liquid, such as gasoline, to start a fire can quickly result in an uncontrolled fire that endangers the loggers and others in the vicinity. Other commenters have told OSHA about the dangers of fires, especially during the dry season (Ex. 5&hyph;7, 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;39). In particular, when an area is cold and wet, gasoline will not volatilize or burn rapidly. However, as the fire gains intensity, the gasoline will evaporate more rapidly, causing the fire to suddenly flame up and can rapidly get out of control. Instead of using gasoline or a gasoline mixture, there are products available that are not combustible to start fires, such as fire starters comprised of sawdust and wax. These products are small, light weight and will not suddenly accelerate their combustion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA has deleted from the final rule the proposed requirement that chain-saw fuel not be used as a solvent. Two commenters said that chain-saw fuel is recommended by manufacturer's as a cleaning solvent for chain-saws (Ex. 5&hyph;7, 5&hyph;34). For example, manufacturers' specifications indicate that chain-saw fuel is the most effective solvent for cleaning chain-saw air filters. OSHA agrees with the commenters and has eliminated the prohibition from the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Explosives and Blasting Agents  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> At paragraph (d)(10) of the final standard, OSHA is including requirements on the safe use of explosives and blasting agents. Paragraph (d)(10)(i) of the final requires that explosives and blasting agents be stored, handled, transported and used in accordance with the requirements of subpart H of this part. This provision has been adopted from the proposed rule. The 1978 ANSI logging standard contained a similar requirement. All State logging standards contain requirements on the use of explosives and blasting agents. There were no comments opposing this provision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (d)(10)(ii) of the final rule requires that only designated persons handle or use such materials. As discussed above, a designated person is one who possesses the requisite training, knowledge and experience to perform the specific duties. The proposed rule and the 1978 ANSI logging standard also required that explosives only be handled by trained and experienced personnel. All State logging standards also require that only trained employees handle explosives. OSHA did not receive any comments on these provisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At paragraph (d)(10)(iii) of the final standard, OSHA is requiring that explosives and blasting agents not be transported in the driver compartment or any passenger-occupied area of a machine or vehicle. The proposed rule did not contain a similar requirement. OSHA has added this provision in the final rule for the same reason that it included a similar provision regarding flammable and combustible liquids. OSHA believes that employees may be gravely endangered by riding over rough terrain and trails in close proximity to explosives.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (e) Hand and Portable Powered Tools <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (e) of this final rule contains requirements for the safe use of hand and portable powered tools, including chain saws. For the most part, these requirements were derived from corresponding provisions in the pulpwood logging standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the final rule OSHA has combined provisions regarding both hand tools and chain saws. This was done to provide uniformity in how tools are addressed in the logging standard. In addition, OSHA has combined these provisions to reduce duplicative provisions, such as those dealing with maintenance and inspection of tools.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

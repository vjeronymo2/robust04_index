That AD also provides an optional terminating action, which, if accomplished, would terminate the repetitive inspections. That AD was prompted by a report that both shear pins that attach the aft end of the center engine pylon thrust link to the tail pylon were missing. This action would add inspections to verify that the shear pin retainer attaching parts are tightened within specified limits; and a terminating modification for those inspections. This action would also remove the optional terminating action, and expand the applicability of the rule to include additional airplanes. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent structural damage to the engine mount structure, which could lead to loss of airplane components. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments must be received by May 10, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 93&hyph;NM&hyph;216&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056.

That AD also provides an optional terminating action for the repetitive inspections. That AD was prompted by a report that both shear pins that attach the aft end of the center engine pylon thrust link to the tail pylon were missing. The requirements of that AD are intended to prevent structural damage to the engine mount structure, which could lead to loss of airplane components.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the issuance of AD 92&hyph;23&hyph;03, one operator has reported that, during the initial visual inspection conducted in accordance with that AD, all bolts and nuts were found installed; however, during a subsequent repetitive inspection, one nut and one bolt that attach the retainer were missing. If the retainers are missing, the shear pins may also be missing and the engine thrust loads will be improperly distributed to the airplane structure. This condition, if not corrected, could result in structural damage to the engine mount structure, which could lead to loss of airplane components.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA has reviewed and approved McDonnell Douglas MD&hyph;11 Alert Service Bulletin A54&hyph;31, Revision 1, dated June 3, 1993. This service bulletin revision adds procedures for performing repetitive inspections to verify that the shear pin retainer attaching parts are tightened within specific limits. This service bulletin revision also describes procedures for replacement of the existing retainer and attaching parts with a new retainer and attaching parts. Incorporation of this replacement eliminates the need for repetitive visual inspections and repetitive tightness verifications. The effectivity listing of this service bulletin revision includes 34 additional airplanes identified as being subject to the addressed unsafe condition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type design, the proposed AD would supersede AD 92&hyph;23&hyph;03 to continue to require repetitive visual inspections to verify the installation of the shear pins, the shear pin retainers, and the shear pin retainer attaching parts in the aft end of the center engine (No. 2) pylon thrust link. The proposed AD would add repetitive inspections to verify that the shear pin retainer attaching parts are tightened within specified limits. If any shear pin, shear pin retainer, or shear pin retainer attaching part is missing during any inspection, this proposal would continue to require repair in accordance with a method approved by the FAA. The ``optional terminating action'' provided by AD 92&hyph;23&hyph;03, which consists of a one-time verification for tightness of the nuts of the four shear pin retainer attaching bolts, would no longer be provided in the proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed AD would also require eventual replacement of the existing retainer and attaching parts with a new retainer and attaching parts. When accomplished, this replacement would be considered terminating action for the currently required repetitive visual inspections and the proposed repetitive verifications of tightness. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the revised alert service bulletin described previously.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

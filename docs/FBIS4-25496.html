			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special" article by Li Xiaozhun (2621 1321 6150)] </F>   [Text] Hong Kong, 29 May (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--In recent  years, since the mainland has actively explored overseas markets  and vigorously improved product quality, while many Taiwan  businesses are investing in the mainland, the mainland has  apparently gotten the upper hand on Taiwan in the competition  for foreign trade, especially for market shares in the United  States.    In 1992, China, with $25.5 billion worth of exports to the  United States, overtook Taiwan for the first time. In 1993,  China left Taiwan further behind, with $31.4 billion worth of  exports to $23.5 billion from Taiwan. China's exports to the  United States amounted to $7.4 billion for the first quarter  this year, nearly 40 percent higher than the $5.3 billion worth  achieved by Taiwan. It is predicted that the competition in  foreign trade between the two shores will be getting more acute  since the United States has now renewed the most-favored-nation  [MFN] status for China. And the mainland, as a traditional  exporter of labor-intensive products, is expected to gain a  still greater share of the U.S. market.    For years the United States has always been the largest  market for Taiwan exports. In recent years, however, Taiwan's  competitive power as a traditional exporter of labor-intensive  products has been declining because of the increase in  production costs as a result of labor shortages and wage  increases. Consequently Taiwan export market share in the  United States has been decreasing year by year. Taiwan's exports  to the United States have been continuously declining since  1987, and Taiwan product market share has decreased from 6.07  percent in that year down to 4.34 percent in 1993. Meanwhile,  however, China's share of the U.S. market has been expanding  from 1.55 to 5.46 percent during the same period.    Of the traditional Chinese and Taiwan exports to the United  States, China-made garments, plastic products, furniture, and  shoes exported to the United States increased by 22, 59, 44, and  32 percent respectively in 1993; whereas Taiwan-made garments,  plastic products, and shoes exported to the United States  decreased by 7.1, 6.6, and 30.8 percent respectively, only  furniture exports which registered a slight increase of 1.9  percent. What is more, China's toy exports to the United States  has now surpassed by far Taiwan's past record in terms of export  value. All these changes indicate that Taiwan has lagged behind  China in terms of competitive power for quite a few export items  in the U.S. market.    The United States recently announced the renewal of the MFN  status for China Mainland. This will give an impetus to further  increasing the competitive power of China's exports to the U.S.  market. And China's exports, especially labor-intensive  products, will further expand their market share in the United  States. To meet the increasingly keen competition between the  two shores of the Taiwan Strait in foreign trade, Taiwan will  need to step up its efforts to upgrade local industries, further  readjust the composition of exports to the United States, and  increase exports with high added value, otherwise it can hardly  improve its position in the competition with China for share of  U.S. market.</p>

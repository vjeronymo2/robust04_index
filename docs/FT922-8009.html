			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Shell The market was rightly impressed by Shell's first quarter figures. In the same period, the big US oil companies' net incomes on a replacement cost basis fell between 40 and 60 per cent and BP's dropped nearly 90 per cent. Stripping out exceptional credits, Shell managed to limit the damage to less than a third of its income. It also generated Pounds 1bn of surplus cash and invested Pounds 1.2bn, leaving gearing at a mere 5 per cent. In the oil sector at least, Shell is not so much ahead of the pack as in a class of its own. Its present strength comes from its diversity. The US market was predictably awful but was more than offset by growth in European gas volumes and a strong downstream performance in the Far East. Its huge investment programme is already paying off, and the group is scarcely under peer pressure to increase its dividend any faster. Although the sector's cyclical problems are not over yet, Shell looks singularly well set for the long term.</p>

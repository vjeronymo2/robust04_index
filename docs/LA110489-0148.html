			<p><P> November 4, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH;  </P> <P> PHONE FUND-RAISERS MISLEAD, POLICE SAY  </P> <P> The Police Department is warning residents to beware of people soliciting money  over the telephone in the name of the Newport Beach police.  </P> <P> According to Andy Gonis, police spokesman, the majority of complaints have come  from residents who have been contacted by a firm that is soliciting  contributions for another police department.  </P> <P> Gonis said some people have complained that the solicitors portray themselves  either as Newport police officers or representatives of the department. Gonis  said they are not. The Newport Beach Police Employees Assn. does not  participate in any type of fund-raising by telephone or door-to-door  solicitation, according to Gonis.  </P> <P> Gonis noted, however, that some police organizations do solicit by telephone  and that people should take the time to verify that all solicitations are  legal.  </P></p>

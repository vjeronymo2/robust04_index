			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Sport: Forward from the ruins - Cricket I SHARED a taxi from the station to Lord's with three people I had seen at a county match but did not know. They wanted to cut their losses on fares, if not results. They knew England were going to lose. We all knew that, before the match started. What kept us deep in discussion was the nature of the loss and the changes it might prompt. We planned a new future for English cricket. One of the few virtues of watching Test cricket in England now is that it makes you look forward, not back. For the selectors to go back in times of trouble to ageing players such as Mike Gatting and Neil Foster is a stop-gap move with no long-term point. It is not part of a clear policy. We agreed on that, inspiring our driver to declare: 'We need a really crushing defeat, a total, wipe-the-floor, smashed-to-bits, down-and-out defeat.' He warmed to his topic. 'Then we can get young blood in the team. That's our only hope.' All the prescriptions offered were our 'only hope.' Youth, Botham, a new system of cricket organisation, no more Essex, no more foreigners, a better captain - each of these was put forward. The media sees a new spirit as the key to success, but that begs the question. Of course confidence and aggression would help England win, as they have helped Australia so far, but England are unlikely to acquire these qualitites without a win. I think perhaps a county win over the Australians might help, stripping the emperor of some of the clothes with which English ineptitude has adorned him. On England's part, something should be seen to be done to create a climate of initiative, never one of the cricketing establishment's strong points. Chris Lewis came out of the winter tour to India with more credit than most, but looks now to have been allowed simply to stay in the team rather than being selected to fight Australia. Nor has Robin Smith done much recently to keep his place. A sort of mental ailment seems to infect all who join the Test management squad, numbing their perception and sense of purpose. It has infected the once-cavalier chairman of selectors, Ted Dexter, and the once-wily team manager Keith Fletcher, who is in decline along with his team. Take Lewis again. He is a superb fielder but dropped a straight catch off David Boon (then 77) with the air of someone who felt it was hardly worth going for broke because it would not change the result, likewise his suicidal batting just before lunch in England's second innings. The trouncing at Lord's has worsened this feeling of being pre-destined to lose, and the taxi driver might be right that the only hope is a massive shake-up. It should start with the opening bowlers and batsmen. They do more than set the scene; they grasp the game as soon as it begins. England were already defeated when they walked out to bat after Australia declared at 632 for four. That is why Mike Atherton's 80 and 99 were so impressive - they were solitary, heroic, and against all odds. Indeed, in the quiet glades of unofficial gambling at Lord's, someone told me that, after the declaration, he had offered odds of 10,000/1 against England winning - but there were no takers. An English victory was beyond a bet; it was a fantasy. Once they had failed to break through Australia's opening partnership, they had lost the game. Leaving aside the serried ranks of England's first-change bowling talent, a penetrating opening pair is crucial. But where to find them? Devon Malcolm is sometimes wayward but does at least bowl fast; if nothing else, that should have novelty value. So might Kent's Mark Ilott who, while only fast-medium, is a left-armer. Or Surrey's Martin Bicknell, who can swing the ball late. Speed and swing have been missing noticeably from England's bowling lately. Where opening batsmen are concerned, the irony is that there is a positive traffic jam of them on the county circuit. As a pair, skipper Graham Gooch and Atherton have lost the rhythm with which once they opened the English innings; and, if Gooch retires soon or stands down as opener, the selectors may be inclined towards replacing him with Alec Stewart. Yet, this would not be a strong choice although he does need to be relieved of the ill-fitting burden of wicket-keeping. With more enterprise, they could choose another left-handed Kentishman in Mark Benson; Derbyshire's Peter Bowler; or Somerset's Mark Lathwell, who has become a symbol of young and dashing cricket (the sort that tends to make the selectors look like a gang of agorophobic godfathers). Mike Slater had less experience of first-class cricket than Lathwell when he and Mark Taylor destroyed England with their opening 260 at Lord's. He was pleased to be chosen for this (his first) Test series, but not unduly surprised. Clutching a beer afterwards, he beamed and shrugged. 'I felt good. The pitch felt good. Why not do well?' Try telling that to an English cricketer just now. I am glad Gooch is to stay in charge for the third Test at Trent Bridge, in defiance of Australian predictions and after his splendid batting performance in the first at Old Trafford. In the long term, though, I favour one of the thoughtful breed of captains - like Ray Illingworth or Fletcher - skilled at getting the most out of the least. I could be wrong, but my instinct inclines towards someone like Yorkshire's Martyn Moxon rather than, say, the hard-hitting, straightforward Hugh Morris, skipper of Glamorgan. Interesting candidates will be easier to assess at the end of the season. Rather the selectors than me.</p>

			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> LAWNDALE COUNCIL DELAYS VOTE ON FATE OF COMMUNITY GARDEN  </P> <P> The Lawndale City Council has delayed a decision on whether to retain a  community garden at 160th Street and Sombra Avenue or develop the site for a  park or a senior citizen housing project.  </P> <P> Council members delayed the decision Thursday to give City Atty. David J.  Aleshire time to study the property deed to determine if there are any  restrictions on changing the use. The matter should be brought before the  council again during its meeting Oct. 5, city officials said.  </P> <P> Last month the Park and Recreation Commission unanimously recommended that a  park be built at the site of the 22,000-square-foot garden, which includes rows  of corn stalks, squash, tomatoes, onions, pumpkins, cucumbers and other  vegetables.  </P> <P> During Thursday's council meeting, about 10 residents spoke on the issue. Most  said they support a park on the site.  </P> <P> "I strongly feel that the area called the Lawndale Community Garden would make  a far better park than a senior housing center," said Judy Oldziewsky, a  resident on 162nd Street.  </P> <P> Mayor Pro Tem Larry Rudolph and Councilman Harold E. Hofmann said they support  a park on the site. Councilwoman Carol Norman said she would like a senior  citizens housing project there. Councilman Dan McKenzie and Mayor Sarann Kruse  said they would like to retain the garden.  </P> <P> There are 45 parcels at the garden, nine of which are not being used, according  to Larry Corrington, the director of recreation and community services. For  $10, residents can rent a 20-foot-by-20-foot parcel for six months. The city  pays for water and garbage disposal.  </P></p>

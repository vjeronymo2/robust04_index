			<p>BFN     [Text] Sanaa, 29 Jun (INA) -- President 'Ali 'Abdallah  Salih today issued a decree naming Mr. Taha Ahmad Ghanim new  governor for Aden. He replaces Salih Munassar al-Siyayli, one  of the secessionist leaders.    It is to be recalled that, except for Crater, al-Mu'alla,  and  al-Tawahi, where the secessionists are entrenched, the Yemeni  legitimate forces are now in control of all of Aden's suburbs.</p>

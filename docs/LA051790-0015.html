			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: NO ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW OF ARTS CENTER  </P> <P> Torrance officials decided Wednesday that a complete environmental review of  the city's Cultural Arts Center is not needed, despite a lawsuit demanding that  they conduct one.  </P> <P> The five city staff members who make up the Environmental Review Board voted  unanimously that an agreement to share parking with Epson Inc., which is  completing its headquarters just north of the future arts center, resolves any  environmental problems that the arts project might cause.  </P> <P> An attorney for developer Jerry Conrow, whose March lawsuit demanded the full  environmental report, argued that the staff had not properly studied the impact  of parking, traffic and noise on the $12.2-million arts complex.  </P> <P> Conrow had hoped to stop construction of the project, which broke ground in  February, because the city late last year created strict new parking  regulations that prevented him from leasing one of his office buildings for use  by the Torrance Superior Court.  </P> <P> He argued that the city's project should have to meet the same strict standards  as private buildings do.  </P> <P> The review board's decision can be appealed to the full City Council, Planner  Jeffery Gibson said.  </P></p>

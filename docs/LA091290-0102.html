			<p><P> September 12, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HUGE CANADIAN OIL PROJECT CLOSE TO A DEAL  </P> <P> A multibillion-dollar project that will tap vast oil reserves off Newfoundland  for U.S. refineries has finally overcome a series of delays and will be  launched soon, industry sources said Tuesday.  </P> <P> The $4.4-billion (C$5.1 billion) Hibernia oil project has been beset by doubts,  squabbles and delays, but oil companies and the federal and Newfoundland  governments are reportedly resolving final details and close to a deal.  </P> <P> The pact will be signed next week at the latest and construction will begin  this month, the sources said.  </P> <P> Production at Hibernia -- which was discovered in 1979 and is believed to  contain between 525 million and 890 million barrels of oil -- will begin in  1996.  </P> <P> Negotiations over government aid and Newfoundland's participation in  construction had in part delayed the project, which is designed to produce  110,000 barrels of oil a day for refining on the East coast of the United  States.  </P> <P> Mobil Corp.'s Canadian unit holds a 28.1% stake in Hibernia, Gulf Canada  Resources Ltd. owns 25%, government-owned Petro-Canada Inc. has another 25% and  Chevron Corp.'s Canadian unit holds 21.9%.  </P> <P> Energy analysts were skeptical that the project would go ahead because it was  not expected to be viable unless oil fetched $25 a barrel.  </P> <P> When the project was announced ahead of the November, 1988, elections -- with  generous federal funding seen as a blatant attempt to buy votes in the East --  oil prices were well below $20 a barrel.  </P> <P> But the final agreement comes when oil prices have been driven above $30 a  barrel by Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.  </P></p>

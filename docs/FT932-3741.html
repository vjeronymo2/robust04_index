			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / UK Company News: City fears cut in final dividend from BET PRELIMINARY results on Monday from BET, the industrial services group, are likely to produce further disappointment, including a cut in the final dividend. At the interim stage last November, five months after a Pounds 200m rights issue, Mr John Clark, chief executive, said it was the board's current intention to maintain the final 6.5p dividend. But in the run-up to Monday's results, the market has come to expect a dividend cut and further provisions to reorganise businesses and asset write-downs. The shares had risen from a low in April of 85p to 115p but this week fell back to 108p ahead of the results. The interim dividend was cut from 4.25p to 2p. Robert Fleming Securities expects a final dividend of 2.5p while Morgan Stanley expects a larger cut. More worrying to shareholders who took up the June 1992 rights issue, may be the fears among analysts that BET has not yet reorganised the business into a shape which will provide a firm foundation from which to grow when the recovery takes root. Many of BET's businesses have low barriers to entry and have consequently faced significant margin pressure in addition to the difficulties growing sales. 'Rather than being poised for recovery,' says research from Fleming, 'BET is still restructuring and trying to refine its portfolio down to its strongest core businesses.' The rights issue has, however, allowed BET to improve its balance sheet by repaying most of its auction market preferred stock. Robert Fleming expects pre-tax profits of Pounds 67m before the restructuring costs.</p>

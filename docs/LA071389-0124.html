			<p><P> July 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: LAKEWOOD;  </P> <P> TRAFFIC TO BE RESTRICTED FOR PIONEER BLVD. REPAVING JOB  </P> <P> Traffic on Pioneer Boulevard and some intersecting streets will be restricted  when construction begins this month to repave the boulevard and install traffic  signal control devices.  </P> <P> Sully-Miller Contracting Co. of Long Beach, lowest of six bidders, will do the  work under a $302,969 contract awarded by the County Board of Supervisors,  Supervisor Deane Dana announced. The project is estimated to take about 30  working days.  </P> <P> Construction will extend 1 1/4 miles from just north of Los Coyotes Boulevard  to Carson Street. A small portion of Pioneer Boulevard touches Cerritos at the  northern end, and another small portion touches Hawaiian Gardens on the south,  but the majority of the work will be in Lakewood.  </P> <P> On Pioneer, traffic will be reduced to two lanes during working hours, but  three lanes, including a left-right turn lane, will be available all other  times. Del Amo Boulevard at its intersection with Pioneer also will be reduced  to one lane in each direction. Traffic signal loop detectors, which sense the  presence of vehicles and trigger signal changes, will be installed at Pioneer  and Carson.  </P></p>

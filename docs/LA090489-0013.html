			<p><P> September 4, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> A fiery explosion ripped through an underground oil tank at a Kearny Mesa  asphalt plant Sunday, seriously injuring one worker, a Fire Department  spokesman said.  </P> <P> The worker, who was not identified, was filling an adjacent tank using a  solvent and a heating device when the solvent caught fire and touched off the  blast at 3:58 p.m., spokesman Jon MacDonald said. The victim was reported in  serious condition with neck and chest burns at the UC San Diego Medical Center  burn unit.  </P> <P> Firefighters allowed the two-alarm fire, at the Sims Harris plant in the 9200  block of Kearny Villa Road, to burn itself out in the partially filled tank  before sealing the vessel, MacDonald said.  </P> <P> Crude oil is used in the manufacture of asphalt. Heating devices and solvents  are used to keep the asphalt flowing through the underground tanks.  </P></p>

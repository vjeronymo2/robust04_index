			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Utilities The scale of interim dividends from regional electricity companies should not hoodwink investors into expecting similar generosity at the full year. Yesterday's 20 per cent increase from Southern Electric was aimed - like others in the sector - at rebalancing the dividend away from the year-end. Some investors will doubtless buy stock for the additional interim payment, in which case the shares might suffer more than usual after the ex-dividend date. Still, dividend growth of perhaps 15 per cent this year is reason enough to hold electricity shares and explains why the Recs have out-performed water companies. Both sectors were privatised on yields 50 per cent above the market average. While water remains weighed down by regulatory worries, electricity companies have broken free. Yields, a shade above the market average, show how far the risks are seen to have diminished. Since both sectors face regulatory reviews next year, that out-performance might seem strange. But with dividends covered three times by earnings and positive cash flow under all but the most draconian settlements, Recs look better placed to cope with tighter price controls. Water companies will be borrowing heavily to finance capital expenditure through the second half of the decade. Dividends will thus remain a potential point of conflict with the regulator. Since the Recs have both a stronger hand and greater freedom to distribute, the yield differential looks like more than a passing phase.</p>

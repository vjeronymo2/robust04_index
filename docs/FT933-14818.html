			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / Port industry over a barrel: Licences, losses and over-production PORT wine shippers say their centuries-old trade is facing a collapse in prices and the possibility of 30,000 grape growers being left destitute. The reason is not to do with the world recession but a breakdown in the balance between sales and production. The Association of Port Wine Shippers (AEVP) is refusing to make any commitment about quantities of wine they will buy in 1993 or how much they will pay. 'We already have millions of pounds tied up in stock,' said one shipper, 'and we simply cannot undertake to increase our stocks further without some guarantee that over-production will cease.' The shippers' underlying fear is that over-production and falling prices will undermine the prestige of port and its hard won reputation. In a harshly-worded letter to Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva, the Portuguese prime minister, the AEVP warns: 'The lowering of consumer prices is discrediting the product, which could suffer the same fate as sherry, with a swing of consumption away to competing drinks.' The association also queries procedures for issuing licences to growers, expressing concern about what they perceive as a lack of control over distributing licences. They note that the Casa do Douro (House of Douro), which controls wine production in port's demarcated zone in the upper reaches of the Douro river, has granted licences for more than 100,000 pipes of wine in excess of the government stipulated total. (A pipe equals 550 litres.) This means that stocks of port are now vastly in excess of forecast demand, even allowing for the 'law of the third'. This was imposed to guarantee a minimum age for port on the market and states that a company cannot sell more in a given year than one-third of stocks in December of the previous year. Buyers for European supermarkets that purchase large quantities of port for bottling under their own label have taken advantage of the over-production and the price of buyer's-own-brand (BOB) port has dropped 20 per cent over the past year. Over-production has also hit premium branded port. The pressure of over-production is now coming to a head and the hardest-hit victims will be the grape farmers of the upper Douro valley. The region was the first to be demarcated in 1756 and farmers are totally dependent on vines for their livelihoods. Farmers, forced by over-production to sell below cost, face real hardships and there have been angry demonstrations in the streets of Regua, the grape-growing capital. The amount of wine that can be produced each year is stipulated by a government body, the Port Wine Institute (IVP), on a basis of existing stocks, forecast sales and other factors. But the responsibility for distributing individual licences stating how much farmers can produce and of what quality, falls to the Casa do Douro. This is a corporate body left over from the Salazar dictatorship, to which all farmers must belong. Besides allocating growing licences, it also represents farmers in terms of prices fixed with the shippers and buys excess production from growers. From 1986 the Casa do Douro began issuing production licences far in excess of the overall limit set by the IVP. By 1992 the accumulated excess had reached more than 100,000 pipes. In 1992, the shippers stepped in to buy the excess production of the 1991 harvest themselves to stop the market from being flooded. The shippers point out that the biggest excesses came in an election year and that the votes of 30,000 farmers were clearly more important than 40 shippers. Some shippers have hinted at corruption saying 'the money for election campaigns has to come from somewhere'. The Casa de Douro complicated the issue even further in 1990 when it bought 40 per cent of the second largest Port shipper, Real Companhia Velha (RCV). The Italian financier Carlo De Benedetti and his Portuguese partner recently pulled out of RCV after a year of management squabbles. The Casa do Douro is burdened with debts of over Es25bn and stocks that may be worth a lot less than the market prices that body's supporting banks attribute to them. The solution, according to the shippers, is to wipe the Casa do Douro's massive stocks off the market by distilling them into grape brandy and to hand over production licences to a more independent body such as the IVP. The AEVP urges low production levels over the next few years to restore the balance between stocks and demand. 'We've just been all over Europe holding tastings to celebrate 1991 as a vintage year,' said one shipper, 'but the truth is the trade is in deep trouble and something needs to be done very quickly.'</p>

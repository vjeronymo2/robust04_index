Barring all women of child-bearing age from certain  jobs? This outrageous decision was upheld by the U.S. 7th Circuit Court of  Appeals?  </P> <P> I must be hallucinating back to the turn of the century. I am outraged, and  rapidly becoming militantly feminist. We women must defend ourselves against  such medieval policies!  </P> <P> KATHRYN S. TARBELL  </P> <P> Huntington Beach  </P></p>

"La  Berceuse," which came back from Morocco and headed for Zeebrugge  and "L'Orka," a small shrimp-fishing vessel, were boarded during  a transshipment operation involving a large quantity, 10 tons,  of hashish with a street value of 1 billion Belgian francs.  Caught in the act, the crew of the two vessels, the head of the  operation and 11 accomplices, were arrested and placed at the  disposal of the examining judge of Bruges. [passage omitted]    We can safely assume that all members of the organization's  Belgian gang have been effectively taken out of circulation.</p>

			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / Melton Medes legal actions scheduled for next April The legal actions over Melton Medes are scheduled to start in the High Court next April. The beneficiaries of the pension fund are claiming Pounds 7m compensation for alleged losses over the loan from the pension fund to the company. They claim the funds were improperly handled by Mr Puri and Mr James Philpott, the company's chief executive. In a separate action, SIB is claiming Pounds 4m damages for alleged breaches of Imro rules in the handling of pension fund assets. An application is before the courts for the two cases to be heard together. It remains uncertain whether the beneficiaries will be able to fund their action. They are awaiting a decision on whether they can be awarded a pre-emptive costs ruling to enable them to continue the case.</p>

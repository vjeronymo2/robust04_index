			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Unilever slides The continuing controversy over Unilever's new washing powder undermined the shares, which finished a tortuous session 22 down at 975p with turnover an above average 2m. Analysts estimated the company's investment in 'Persil Power' at Pounds 300m, with prospective annual UK sales weighing in at around the same level. The share price fall came after Unilever withdrew its litigation threat against arch-rival Procter &amp; Gamble, following allegations by the US group that the new detergent ruined clothes. They said that their claims were supported by independent tests and backed by consumer bodies. Top of the range preliminary profits from BAA and news of a planned one-for-one share split triggered a strong performance by shares in the airports group. They reached a session high of 957p before settling a net 11 better at 949p following above average turnover of 1.2m. Citing the potential benefits of a further 75,000 square feet increase in retail space and a forecast 4 per cent rise in traffic volumes, Panmure Gordon upgraded its current year profits forecast to Pounds 370m. NatWest, which expects BAA to achieve profits of Pounds 365m, described the shares as a 'good strong hold'. Commercial Union shares moved ahead strongly, with insurance specialists continuing to dismiss the latest crop of market rumours suggesting that CU is contemplating a bid for the French insurance company Group Victoire. 'CU could not afford to buy the whole of Victoire, which would cost in the region of Pounds 1.3bn,' said one leading insurance analyst. 'Maybe they could acquire certain parts of the business if it was broken up by Suez, Victoire's parent.' CU advanced 16 to 548p, although turnover in the stock was a modest 857,000 shares. Sedgwick, the insurance broker, staged a good rally after the recent poorly received results, the shares moving up 8 to 172p. Life stocks also made good progress, shrugging off recent worries about disclosure of commissions, as well as other increasing pressures on the life assurance industry. Prudential moved ahead 7 to 296p after Robert Fleming Securities issued its first positive recommendation on the company since early 1992, and said it expected the shares to outperform by 10 per cent over the next year as the market appreciates that higher interest rates are good news for traditional life assurers. The Fleming insurance team said: 'In contrast to popular belief, the recent rise in bond yields improves the profitability of traditional life companies; it increases embedded values and actuarial surpluses. The latter takes some of the pressure off bonus reductions and protects the built-in dividend growth.' Bank shares extended the rally evident at the end of last week when big US funds were said to have been aggressive buyers of the sector. National Westminster featured with a further 11 gain at 467p, while Standard Chartered was the FT-SE 100's best individual performer, climbing 12 to 252p. Motor issues were strong on the back of new car sales figures for May, up 10 per cent from the previous year to 150,070 and compared with only a 5 per cent rise in April. Laird rose 11 1/2 to 390p and GKN was up 7 to 590p. Smiths Industries benefited from its Pounds 150m purchase of medical equipment company Deltec from Pharmacia AB, rising 18 to 470p. The acquisition takes the medical side to around 45 per cent of group operating profit, adding about Pounds 90m sales in the growing area of out-patient care. Strauss Turnbull raised its forecast for pre-tax profits for the year to July 1995 from Pounds 129m to Pounds 133m, taking forecast earnings from 29p to 30p per share. The telecoms team at Hoare Govett was said to have been the driving force behind the latest good performance from Cable and Wireless, highlighting the new management team at Hong Kong Telecom and the growth potential of the Chinese telecoms market. C&amp;W firmed 6 more to 443p. VSEL fell a further 35 to 875p, after going ex-dividend and on further consideration of last week's results. British Gas, which has underperformed the rest of the market recently, rose 8 to 269p, helped by a Swiss Bank 'buy' recommendation. Analyst Mr Alan Marshall said: 'Concerns over the security of the dividend are, in our opinion, exaggerated.' The next consultative document on British Gas is expected later this month. Profit-taking and ex-dividend calculations took the shine from recent firm showings among leading property stocks MEPC and Land Securities, the former slipping 8 to 446p and the latter 3 1/2 to 635p. Euro Disney again basked in the afterglow of the news that a Saudi Arabian prince is to invest in the theme park operator. The shares surged ahead 29 to 415p. News of a good take-up of the rights issue at Compass Group came as the fully-paid shares gained 6 at 321p. The Great Universal Stores share buy-back story was again doing the rounds, with the stock spurting forward 13 to 578p. Stores specialists said there was increasing expectation in the market that the company would announce the move - rumoured to be in the range of Pounds 1bn - with its preliminary results next month. Marks and Spencer was another firm feature in the stores sector, going ex-dividend but still managing an effective gain of 9 at 399p. WH Smith 'A' was also in demand, moving 11 ahead to 482p.</p>

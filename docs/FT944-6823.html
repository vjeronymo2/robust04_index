			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Flaw in schools' league Sir, I feel your A-level league tables ('Schools' league tables', November 22) have a flaw: the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service points score should be calculated on the top three A-level results gained by the candidate, not the total for several exams, thus giving a maximum score of 30 points. By counting A-levels above the three results required for university entrance, your tables become overshadowed by sixth forms that encourage their highest achieving pupils to take five or more A-levels, for the purpose of improving the school, and not the pupil's results. A pupil with three 'A's is clearly able to deal with A-level exams extremely well, while a pupil gaining a string of five 'C's shows less sign of understanding his subjects, and should not be counted as having achieved as much. This is the line taken by university admission tutors. Sean Lawless, King's College, Cambridge CB2 1ST</p>

According to their report, ``short of  resuming nuclear testing, France is not assured of being in a  position to provide itself with a simulation system that  guarantees absolute mastery over its defense systems, that is,  over its security and independence.'' About 20 new tests are  said to be necessary.    For the first time in the Fifth Republic, members of  Parliament have been led to act as investigators in a field--the  implementation and maintenance of the nuclear  deterrent--recognized as being the sole preserve of the head of  state. This is a precedent, although mission members are prompt  to note that such has long been the case in the United States.  In France, the report contends, ``the secrecy and  `overclassification' which surround anything to do with nuclear  technology, and the extreme scientific and technical complexity  of military nuclear technology have often combined to obscure  the approaches followed in this field.'' Mr. Galy-Dejean states  that it is time the government established a scientific and  military council open to personalities with differing  backgrounds, and which would participate in the decisionmaking  process by giving advice and directions.    According to the parliamentary mission, France ``tackled  belatedly'' the problem of nuclear testing simulation. The  United States began studies on the matter as early as 1980,  carrying out about 50 experiments. France only performed one,  in 1991, out of the 204 tests (including security tests) it  performed since its first one in 1960 in the Sahara. Another  experiment had been scheduled for 1992, but Mr. Mitterrand then  decreed a suspension, which is still standing.    Why are experiments needed? According to Mr. Galy-Dejean,  whose information comes from the Atomic Energy Commission [CEA],  the purpose of testing is as follows:    -- validating fundamental physics concepts as they relate to  nuclear weapons;    -- validating concepts selected for weapon development and  production;    -- checking weapon reliability over time, as aging  characteristics are difficult to predict with certainty;    -- maintaining scientist and researcher know-how;    -- enhancing the deterrence effect, by showing the world  that  weapons work;    -- checking, through safety tests, that a stored weapon does  not constitute a hazard.  <H5>  Significant Investments </H5>   In 1981, France performed on average about 12 tests a year.  This figure was gradually reduced to five. In 1991, to remedy  this cut and ``not at all as a measure taken in anticipation of  a total ban on nuclear testing,'' notes Mr. Galy-Dejean, the  PALEN (preparation to nuclear testing limitation) program was  implemented. The goal was twofold: Checking the effectiveness  and safety of operational weapons, and renewing deterrent  payloads through nuclear tests involving minimal energy expenses.    Significant investments need to be made in computing power  (some Fr400 million in computers 50 times as powerful as today's  platforms), in radiographic accelerators (no less than Fr430  million) and megajoule lasers (Fr6 to 7 billion should France  not be able to develop such equipment jointly with the United  States).    It is expected that this equipment will not be available  before the year 1998 or 2002. This is why the parliamentary  mission states that, according to the experts it has consulted  with, France needs another 20 or so full-size tests. Ten such  tests should make it possible to develop PALEN procedures, and  another 10 are needed to finalize the design of the nuclear  warheads of the M.5 and ASLP (long-range air-to-ground) missiles  intended for future strategic submarines as well as the Rafale  aircraft.</p>

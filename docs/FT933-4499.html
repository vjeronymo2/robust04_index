			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Survey of Mobile Communications (1): Seamless networks on way - Andrew Adonis looks at the latest milestone in the industry and foresees the emergence of an integrated marketplace The mobile communications industry is racing ahead so fast, the milestones are out of sight almost as soon as they are passed. Few doubt, however, that last month's Dollars 12bn-plus takeover of McCaw Communications by the US giant American Telephone &amp; Telegraph marks a decisive turning point, giving a huge impetus to the development of cellular telecommunications and their integration with fixed-wire networks. AT&amp;T paid dearly for McCaw, too dearly in the view of many commentators, given that McCaw is still loss-making and loaded with nearly Dollars 5bn of debt. There are also regulatory hurdles to be overcome: the regional Bell operators claim that the takeover breaches the 1984 ruling which forced AT&amp;T out of the 'local loop', and will allow the long-distance and international operator to re-enter it by the cellular back door. If their arguments before the courts and the Federal Communications Commission come to anything, AT&amp;T will have some hard explaining to do to its shareholders. The balance of opinion, though, is that Mr Robert Allen, AT&amp;T's chairman, will carry the day with his protestation that he is 'not interested in re-entering the local telephone business'. In any case, the 1984 settlement is under increasing assault: the ban on the 'Baby Bells' offering cable television in their telephone service areas may not survive for much longer, and if that goes, the rest of the artificial regulatory edifice will be in danger of collapse. Assuming, then, that AT&amp;T is able to keep and exploit its spoils, where will it go? Dismiss crude ideas that AT&amp;T - or mobile operators almost anywhere else in the world - will engage in head-on competition with local fixed-wire networks. The economics make nonsense of that idea for the foreseeable future, even allowing for a decline in cellular charges with rising volumes and rapidly falling costs for infrastructure and terminals. Local fixed-wire tariffs are set to increase in real terms, as further rebalancing of local against long-distance and international tariffs takes place, but the differential will remain stark. Wire-less communications will complement, not replace, the fixed wire: integration, not supersession, is the watchword. For users, the next few years will offer improved quality, seamless services covering fixed and mobile networks, and a range of new services for carrying voice and data, albeit shrouded in acronyms like DECT, ISDN, GSM, MCN, PCN and CT2 (and they are just the raw essentials). There is also the prospect of lower tariffs, but not as low or as soon as all that. Over the past year low-user packages have reached most markets, but what they offer by way of reduced subscription and access charges they take away by making the phones prohibitively expensive for the owner to make outgoing calls. Indeed, the new generation of digital cordless phones is pushing cellular prices sharply upwards. In the UK the first digital cellular phones will retail for about between Pounds 250 and Pounds 400, several times the cost of a (far lighter) handset for the existing analogue networks. For operators, the challenge is threefold. First, to exploit the potential of their existing businesses more effectively than hitherto, in particular by tapping the consumer market. Second, to build new markets by acquiring domestic and overseas licences for new services, an ever-smaller proportion of which are being awarded on the nod to established state operators. Even in countries fiercely committed to defending their public telephone operator monopolies for fixed-wire services, overseas operators are being encouraged to provide mobile services, typically by licensing a second competitor to the PTO for new services. The third challenge is integration: to enhance the complementarity of wire-less and wire-line services by improving the interface between them in terms of technology, marketing and the provision of value-added services such as personal numbering. It is in this third field that AT&amp;T is in a position to add most value, marketing 'one-stop' packages and developing new interconnections with its long-distance network. 'The seamless North American cellular network is becoming a reality,' says Mr Robert Morris, telecommunications analyst at Goldman Sachs. The introduction of the IS-41 switching interface standard means that markets across the US are being inter-connected for automatic call delivery. The roll-out of digital technology is also progressing, despite continuing debate between two different technology standards. Analysys, the Cambridge-based consultancy in the UK, argues in a recent report that the next three years will see operators jostling for position 'in the emerging integrated marketplace'. In the US, AT&amp;T may lead the way. By contrast, in Europe Analysys believes mobile network operators and new competitors to existing PTOs are likely to do so, because of the regulatory difficulties for Europe's PTOs in establishing themselves in the mobile market and the technological difficulties of providing next-generation services without a mobile network. If successful in the US, AT&amp;T will boost a market that is already experiencing phenomenal growth. Since 1984, the US cellular market has grown from about 1m to 12m subscribers. It expanded by a further 627,000 in the first quarter of this year alone, compared with 481,700 in the same period in 1992. Economic and Management Consultants International, a Washington consultancy, projects 17.7m subscribers by the end of 1995 and 25m by the end of 1996. The pattern is similar in western Europe, although outside Scandinavia it is rising from a comparatively lower base. According to the FT's Mobile Communications newsletter, the subscriber base has risen by a third in the last year, with 7m at July 1. CIT Research, the London consultancy, projects nearly 12m subscribers by the end of 1996 and 19.1m by the year 2000. The Asia-Pacific region is also undergoing a mobile boom - the number of cellular subscribers in the region's 12 largest markets in the region grew by 50 per cent from 2.7m to 4m last year, and this year's growth rate is again expected to outstrip that of Europe and the US. The mobile take-off is not just in cellular: paging and telepoint technologies are advancing at an extraordinary rate in the region, spurred on by the almost insatiable demand from city-based private consumers for affordable personal communications. Hong Kong alone has more than 700,000 paging subscribers, matching the tally for the whole of the UK. Eastern Europe is the region for which it is most difficult to project growth. The recent auctioning by the Hungarian government of licences to build a new digital cellular network led to a battle royal between consortia led by the German and Nordic PTOs respectively. National cellular and paging services are also set to come on stream in Bulgaria, Poland and the Czech republic. Beyond that, however, the funding of new mobile ventures for any but the wealthiest of western businesses in large cities is problematic. Deutsche Telecom is anxious to establish itself, but is not awash with cash given constraints at home; some private operators, notably US West, have made strides east, but as many again are distinctly wary of following. Says Mr Gerry Whent, chief executive of Vodafone, the UK private mobile operator which bid unsuccessfully for the Hungarian licence: 'It's all too difficult and bureaucratic. Quite frankly, eastern Europe is not in our portfolio; we don't think they are ready for capitalism yet.' Europe, like the US, is moving towards a seamless cellular system with the building of digital networks to the pan-European GSM standard. All the leading European Community states apart from Spain now have them in operation, although in some coverage is still patchy. In most countries two competitors have been licensed, a significant change in policy from the first generation of cellular analogue networks, which were mostly provided by the state telecommunications monopoly. With two competing analogue networks, the UK was a notable exception to the European pattern from the outset. The former state monopoly operator, British Telecommunications, holds only a 60 per cent stake in Cellnet, the smaller and less profitable of the two. Vodafone is the market leader, and since the McCaw sale it is the world's largest dedicated cellular company. It is expanding fast into western Europe and Asia-Pacific, with a medium-term goal of securing overseas licences covering as large a population as in the UK, adjusting for income. Moreover, the UK is set to become the first large European market with three serious cellular operators, with the launch of Mercury One-2-One, a digital PCN network operated by a joint venture of Mercury Communications and US West. Initially its coverage will be confined to the M25 area around London, but it plans to expand rapidly beyond. One-2-One's fate will be an important test of the capacity of competition to bring down prices in the cellular industry. Without the prospect of greater competition, the margins currently achieved by Vodafone and Cellnet would be almost indefensible. Cellnet's revised tariffs, published last week, offer substantial discounts to subscribers in the M25 area, a clear response to One-2-One. If the reductions continue, pressure for regulation will ease. Mobile communications is the world of dreams, abundant material for which is contained in later articles. The ultimate dream, perhaps, is of a truly global handheld mobile tele- phone service. It is still not in prospect, but it has come a step closer with recent finan- cial backing for Motorola's Iridium satellite telecommunications system - described as the world's biggest private sector space project.</p>

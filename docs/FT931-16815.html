			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / Former ministers 'accused' FORMER senior Mexican ministers will be accused before a Los Angeles grand jury of involvement in the torture and murder of Mr Enrique Camarena, an official of the US Drug Enforcement Agency, according to the Mexican weekly Proceso, Damian Fraser writes. Mr Antonio Garate, an agent of the DEA investigating the Camarena murder, told Proceso that Mr Manuel Bartlett, minister of interior from 1982-88 and current governor of the state of Puebla, Mr Enrique Alvarez del Castillo, former governor of Jalisco and attorney-general, and Mr Juan Arevalo, former minister of national defence, would soon be formally accused. The allegations against the three were made by prosecution witnesses in the trial of Mr Humberto Alvarez Machain, acquitted on charges that he aided the murder of Mr Camarena. All three have denied the claims. The US attorney's office in Los Angeles yesterday said it was not in a position to deny or confirm the report.</p>

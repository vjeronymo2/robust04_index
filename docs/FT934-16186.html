			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / International Company News: Wallace Smith Canadian units put into receivership THE liquidator of Wallace Smith Trust group, the UK-based banking and finance group formerly controlled by Mr Wallace Duncan Smith, has put two Canadian companies with links to the group into receivership. The move against the Canadian units is part of a multi-pronged effort by creditors to recover as much as they can of the estimated Pounds 100m (Dollars 149.3m) deficiency in assets which was discovered in the group when it collapsed in early 1991. Mr Smith, who is a Canadian citizen, has been charged with fraud by the Serious Fraud Office in the UK. His trial is expected to start at the Old Bailey in London on November 15. He is on bail of Pounds 250,000. The appointment of the receiver in Canada, like much of the winding-up process in the UK, has been marked by a flurry of legal claims. The liquidator, KPMG Peat Marwick, is claiming substantial damages from Royal Bank of Scotland and National Westminster Bank, as well as from Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the Wallace Smith group's auditor. The main creditors include Credit Lyonnais, Tokio Reinsurance of Japan, DG Bank and Banca Commerciale Italiana. In separate actions, the Toronto-based companies in receivership, Wallace Smith Group and Wallace Smith &amp; Co, have filed two suits against KPMG for a total of Pounds 3.3m. One of the claims alleges that the liquidator has unfairly interrupted the business of the Canadian companies. These companies continued to operate for several months as brokers in North American money market instruments after the collapse of Wallace Smith Trust in the UK. Another Toronto-based company, Wallace Smith Securities, was placed in receivership last October. The Canadian companies put into receivership are in a relatively sound financial position, with net assets estimated at CDollars 4m (USDollars 3.1m). However, Mr Philip Wallace, a partner at KPMG, said yesterday that 'our concern is to avoid wasteful spending of money on proceedings which we don't think would help anybody'. Mr Wallace said that the purpose of appointing the receiver, who is an independent accountant, was to ensure that 'all the litigation gets sorted out in as cost-effective a way as possible'. The creditors of the two Canadian companies are mostly other companies in the Wallace Smith group, as well as employees and professional advisers. The group set up by Mr Smith and his family is an intricate web of companies which included three UK-based trusts. Below each of the trusts were several layers of operating and non-operating companies. The precise relationship between the UK and Canadian branches is among the points of dispute between KPMG and the management of the Canadian companies. Mr Nick Press, an American consultant who has acted as chief executive of the Canadian group, said that the trading links between the two were minimal and dividend flows non-existent.</p>

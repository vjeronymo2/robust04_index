			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / International Company News: Dutch property units plan to explore alliance options WERELDHAVE and VIB, the Netherlands' second and third largest property investment funds, plan to look into the possibility of entering into a 'far-reaching form of co-operation'. The companies, which are listed on the Amsterdam bourse, are to consider all options including that of a merger. Their decision is expected in several months' time. The announcement yesterday comes at a time of extensive alliance building in the Dutch property sector. In December, ABP, the Dutch civil servants' pension fund, said it planned to buy a 12.5 per cent stake in Rodamco, the country's largest property investment fund, in order to expand its international property holdings. Rodamco, which has property holdings of around Fl 8bn (Dollars 4.4bn) and which is seeking new funds for further growth, is also in talks with PGGM, another large Dutch pension fund, about possible co-operation. Wereldhave and VIB have property and other investments worth about Fl 5bn and are very active on overseas markets, but Wereldhave's portfolio is more international. Nearly one-third of Wereldhave's investments is in the UK, a legacy of the company's successful hostile takeover of Peachey Properties in 1988. The two companies' shares rose slightly on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange yesterday following the news of talks on a possible partnership. Wereldhave gained Fl 1.60 to Fl 120.70 while VIB rose Fl 0.10 to Fl 59.80. VIB switched from an open-ended to a closed-ended structure in autumn 1990, in line with Rodamco's decision to stop its daily practice of buying in and selling its own shares to keep its share price equivalent to net asset value. This move forced most other open-ended Dutch property funds to follow suit, and they now all trade at a discount to their net asset value. Wereldhave, by contrast, has always been closed-ended.</p>

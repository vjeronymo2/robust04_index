			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Requirement to Report. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  There is currently no affirmative requirement for public reporting of transactions in municipal securities. In its present form, the Board's rule G&hyph;14 does not require the reporting of transactions in municipal securities, but does require that any such report represent a legitimate trade. The rule requires a dealer that distributes or publishes a report of a transaction in a municipal security to know or have reason to believe that the transaction was actually effected and to have no reason to believe that the transaction was fictitious or in furtherance of any fraudulent, misleading or deceptive purpose. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule change would impose a duty upon dealers to report inter-dealer transaction information to the Board or its designee. It states that such information would be used to make public reports and would be provided to the Commission, the NASD, and bank regulatory organizations charged with enforcing Board rules,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , the Comptroller of the Currency in the case of national banks, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in the case of state member banks of the Federal Reserve System, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (``FDIC'') in the case of other banks insured by the FDIC. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Reporting Procedures. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Brokers, dealers and municipal securities dealers would report transactions under Rule G&hyph;14 Transaction Reporting Procedures, which are also part of the proposed rule change. The transaction reporting procedures designate the NSCC as the Board's agent to receive transaction information. NSCC is a clearing agency registered with the Commission under Section 17A of the Act and is the central facility for automated comparison processing for inter-dealer municipal securities transactions. Automated comparison is the process by which each party to an inter-dealer trade ensures that its contra-party knows the terms of the trade and will be ready to settle, on those terms, on settlement date. In general, the automated comparison process requires each dealer in a transaction to submit information on a trade ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , price, quantity, contra-party) to a comparison system operated by a clearing agency registered with the Commission. This information is then matched (``compared'') by computer in the comparison system and the results reported back to each dealer. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Currently, pursuant to the Board's rule G&hyph;12(f)(i), dealers must use the facilities of a registered clearing agency to compare all inter-dealer transactions in securities with CUSIP numbers. Since NSCC and all other registered clearing agencies offering municipal securities comparison services are linked by automated interfaces, it will be possible for transactions to be submitted to NSCC by submitting them to any such clearing agency. Accordingly, the proposed procedures state that dealers may provide transaction information to NSCC or any other registered clearing agency linked with NSCC for the purpose of automated comparison. Dealers may submit transaction information directly or through an agent that is a member of the registered clearing agency. <FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>  Thus, under the proposed rule change, dealers would not be required to submit transaction data to a separate reporting system and should not incur additional operational costs to fulfill their reporting obligations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> These are the same procedures currently used to submit information for automated comparison. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> With one exception, NSCC automated comparison procedures require both the purchasing and selling dealers to submit information about the trade. Thus, the proposed reporting procedures require transaction information to be submitted by both parties. For transactions involving the distribution of new issue securities from a syndicate manager to syndicate members, however, NSCC comparison procedures require only a submission from the syndicate manager. The proposed procedures allow for the same ``one-sided'' submission of information for public reporting. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The comparison process requires various data elements to be submitted with regard to each transaction. The proposed transaction reporting program makes an identical requirement for these data items. The following transaction information will be collected by the Board through NSCC: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

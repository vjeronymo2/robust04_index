Many grievances were set out in the suit, but perhaps the  most important was that the electoral districts had been  incorrectly apportioned. "In the administrative-territorial  districts the number of voters fluctuates between 10,335 and  173,665," the plea runs. "This contradicts the basic  provisions...." In the democrats' opinion, this would lead to  "more than 60 percent of deputies being elected to the  legislative assembly from a rural population which constitutes  47 percent of the oblast's inhabitants, while the 53 percent of  voters who live in the cities will elect only 37 percent of the  deputies."    The court hearing lasted several days. Meanwhile, in the  local press, the idea was hammered home -- whether for the  benefit of the court or that of the voters -- that the basic  provisions on the elections confirmed by the president were  purely recommendatory in character. As a component of the  Federation the oblast has the right to make its own amendments  to the statute. This argument was also heard in the hall of  sessions. In response Oleg Timofeyev, presiding over the court,  said clearly: "In the event of a contradiction between federal  law and another act, the federal law applies."    Claims that the president's basic provisions on elections  are  recommendatory in character were also ruled unfounded. The  large disproportions in the numbers of voters apparent in the  division of the districts were ruled "not in conformity with the  law."    The court's ruling was made public, but it has not yet been  issued either to the plaintiff or to the defendant. I have  quoted this document from a tape recording. It has yet to be  edited and printed, as is the custom in these cases....  Meanwhile, only two days remain before the elections.    In the evening, people seeking seats in the local duma vied  with one another in eloquence on local television as if nothing  had happened. The Ulyanovsk press appeals: "We hope that the  citizens of Ulyanovsk will not allow the elections to be  disrupted, and will confirm this with a high turnout...."    On 25 March Yuriy Goryachev, head of the oblast  administration, ordered the elections postponed to a later date.  He also adopted an appeal to the oblast's voters. This says  that everything was ready for the elections, but that a group of  political intriguers under the banner of democratic forces had  managed to torpedo the elections. The oblast court, in Yu.  Goryachev's opinion, was also under their thumb.</p>

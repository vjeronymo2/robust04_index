			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 7 (KCNA) -- Yi In-mo, a former war  correspondent of the Korean People's Army who returned to the  socialist homeland on March 19 last year and is now widely known  as the incarnation of faith and will, sent letters on June 7 to  Kim In- so and Ham Se-hwan, unconverted long-term prisoners in  South Korea.    In the letter to Kim In-so he says he feels aggrieved at the  thought of Kim, a septuagenarian who has got a chronic disease  during his nearly 34 years of prison life and is now working  lonely with a colleague at a desolate quarry in South Korea  without flesh and blood.    He writes that respected General Kim Chong-il shows deep  concern for unconverted long-term prisoners like Kim In-so and  is making every effort to fetch them to the North so that they  may recover their health and live in happiness with their  families for the rest of their life.    "The South Korean authorities say that you "have got  citizenship", but this is a mere excuse for refusing to  repatriate you," the letter says, and expresses the belief that  he will daringly wage a struggle for his repatriation as fierce  as his struggle for existence and thus bring earlier the day of  reunion.    In the letter to Ham Se-hwan, Yi recalls that Ham was really  concerned for him when he was in the South.    Noting that the DPRK is making every possible effort for an  early repatriation of Ham Se-hwan, an ailing old man subjected  to a hard life in an alien place, to his hometown where his  sister and relatives live, the letter asks ham to fight for his  repatriation to the North with confidence, for the day of their  reunion in Pyongyang.</p>

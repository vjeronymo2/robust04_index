			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Genetics takes the strain out of being a pig PIG BREEDERS look set to eradicate the gene for stress from their herds. The Pig Improvement Company based in Abingdon, Oxfordshire, using a genetic test developed by scientists at the University of Toronto, has succeeded in removing the gene for porcine stress syndrome from its basic breeding herds and anticipates offering pig farmers a choice of PSS-free or PSS carrier lines by 1995. PSS is a source of considerable economic loss to the pig industry because it leads to sudden death of pigs subjected to stress, during transport or mating for example, and to poor meat quality. Before the development of the new test, called the HAL 1843 halothane test, only pigs carrying two copies of the defective gene could be identified, and then only when they fortuitously reacted adversely during studies on the effects of the anaesthetic halothane. It is these pigs that suffer PSS. Pigs with only one copy of the defective gene, known as carriers and unaffected by PSS, could not be distinguished from those free of the defect. Consequently, carriers passed the gene on to their progeny, thereby preventing its elimination through conventional breeding programmes. The new test enables scientists to identify the number of PSS genes in any pig. 'The development of a DNA test for porcine stress syndrome is the first real breakthrough in DNA biotechnology to have major implications for the pig breeder,' said Mr Hein van der Steen, PIC's UK technical manager. 'Our competitors will be in trouble if they don't start testing too.' Carriers are not only free from PSS but also have an enhanced feed conversion performance, producing more pork per kilogram of food than pigs completely lacking the defect. Therefore, it was important to develop breeding lines with known genetic backgrounds. The elimination of PSS is likely to be worth between Pounds 1.50 and Pounds 3 per slaughter pig - quite a tidy profit for PIC's customers, who produce over 40m pigs a year from PIC's breeding stock.</p>

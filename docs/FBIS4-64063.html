			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: compiled by </F> Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy, edited by Vladimir  Shishlin]    [Text] The transformation of the Russian presidential  administration's control department in a similar body attached  to the president does not mean that this structure will turn  into a total and all-mighty instrument of control, head of the  Board's Department of Foreign Relations Andrey Petrov told  Interfax on Thursday.    "We are turning into an information-analytical structure  which would cooperate with the Foreign Intelligence Service, the  Federal Counter-Intelligence Service and the tax inspection," he  believes. Petrov noted that the priority task of the board which  previously dealt with checking the implementation of laws and  decrees, will be the preparation of informational-analytical  materials for the Russian leader about the activities of the  federal power bodies and power bodies of the subjects of the  Federation.    Speaking about the right to demand documents necessary for  check-ups from enterprises and organizations, Petrov pointed out  that the board has no intention to violate the law on commercial  secret. "Our enquiries may concern regular information about the  financial and economic activities," he said.    According to Petrov, commercial structures will not be the  main target of check-ups. "We are more interested in the federal  and regional power structures and high-ranking officials," he  said.    Petrov noted that the president's decision to transform the  board was not caused by some current political reasons, and by  no means is linked with the package of economic decrees signed  recently by Boris Yeltsin. IF Note: According to the provision  on control board at the president, it performs the following  functions: prepares and presents to the president analytical  information about activities of federal power bodies, state  power bodies of the subjects of the Federation on implementation  of the Russian Constitution, decrees and orders of the  president, checks activities of the federal executive power  bodies, executive bodies of the subjects of the Federation,  their leaders and apparatus, as well as institutions and  organization, carries out check-ups of activities of the  presidential administration's division, considers complaints and  appeals of citizens, enterprises, institutions and organization;  analyzes activities of special control and supervision bodies of  the federal executive power bodies and their subdivisions in  regions, etc.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] The Liberian Peace Council [LPC] has become  something of a thorn in the flesh of the Transitional Council  which took power last month. The LPC was formed last year to  oppose Charles Taylor's NPFL [National Patriotic Front of  Liberia] faction, one of the three signatories to the Cotonou  Peace Accord, and over the last few days there have been reports  that the LPC is demanding a seat on the Transitional Council as  a price for laying down its arms. Well, the LPC's leader,  George Burly, is passing through Freetown at the moment. On the  line, Robin White asked him exactly what their position was.    [Begin recording] [Burly] Robin, we've made it categorically  clear, unequivocally clear, that we have never sought any seat  on the Transitional Government, the Transitional Council. We  have never sought any seat and we have never requested for any  seat on the council. It is not our desire. That's not our  ambition.    [White] So what is your ambition? What do you want?    [Burly] The Liberian Peace Council is a resistance movement  to the atrocities hit upon our people by the NPFL, and as a  resistance movement we've ensured first of all that we stay  alive. We have done that and we have done so successfully. We  have done so to the extent where we now control or have managed  to repel the NPFL from 60 percent of the landmass of Liberia,  six counties. Let me tell you another thing. We have been told  that we are no party to Cotonou and we wish to inform you and  everyone else that while we may not be a party to Cotonou or any  accord intended to broker peace in Liberia, we are a party to  the Republic of Liberia and its interests.    [White] So what kind of political solution do you want for  Liberia yourself?    [Burly] Robin, we would like to see a political  configuration  that would take into consideration the interests of all the  parties, particularly our security.    [White] So, you are looking for some kind of new government.    [Burly] Whatever you wish to call it. We insist that there  must be something that takes our security into consideration.    [White] But surely the only way you can guarantee your  security is to be in government in some shape or form.    [Burly] Robin, there is a lot that one can do outside of  government, you know that.    [White] But what would guarantee your security then?    [Burly] We made proposals to ECOMOG [Economic Community of  West African States Cease-fire Monitoring Group] and we've made  proposals to the UN, the people that are responsible for what  should be happening on the ground.    [White] And have you had any response?    [Burly] Not as yet.    [White] You claim that you control 60 percent of Liberia?    [Burly] Robin, we control Sinoe, Maryland, Grand Gedeh,  Grand  Kru, Rivercess, and Grand Bassa counties, and more.    [White] But Mr. Taylor claims to control 60 percent of  Liberia.    [Burly] Robin, that's Mr. Taylor's problem. [end recording]</p>

			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / UK Company News: Losses mount as SHT tries to cut debt SCOTTISH HERITABLE Trust, the mini-conglomerate, yesterday announced pre-tax losses, including exceptional items, of Pounds 5.03m for 1992. This compares with a Pounds 792,000 pre-tax loss last time but does not include extraordinary charges of Pounds 14.9m (Pounds 1.85m). These included Pounds 9.3m in respect of goodwill attributable to businesses sold, where previously it had been written off to reserves at the time of acquisition. The charges also includes provisions for losses made on the disposal since the start of 1993 of three companies and the write down of net assets of other group companies to their current market value. The sale during 1992 of Standard Fireworks and hospital bed manufacturer Hoskins and non-consolidation in 1992 of turnover from Scottish Heritable Inc, contributed to a drop in turnover to Pounds 44.6m (Pounds 96.5m). There is no dividend. The group's current level of debt is about Pounds 30m; its net assets are Pounds 4.7m. Mr Stuart Macdonald, chief executive, confirmed that gearing is currently about 600 per cent. Mr Richard Hanwell, chairman, said that while the banks continued to support SHT they had made clear substantial additional reductions must be made in the near future. Two disposals, understood to be of US-based operations, are at an advanced stage of negotiation. Mr Macdonald commented: 'Our first objective has to be to get our debt down to an acceptable level and then see what is left.' Losses per share before extraordinary items were 14p (1.5p), and 55.6p (6.6p) including them.</p>

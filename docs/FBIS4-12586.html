			<p>BFN     [Text] This morning, 10 representatives of the Danish,  Norwegian, and Italian observers met with Hebron Mayor Mustafa  al- Natshah in the city. At the end of the meeting, the mayor  said he hopes the observers will be able to separate the Arab  residents of Hebron and the settlers.    Our correspondent Moti Amir reports that Khalid 'Amayirah,  the chief Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] spokesman,  attacked the presence of the observers in the city and said this  is merely a public relations stunt. He warned that if the  residents of Hebron do not feel a change in their security, the  force might be in danger.    The head of the Norwegian delegation said that his men were  received warmly in Hebron and that the mayor briefed him on the  city's problems. He expressed the hope that the observers force  will be able to start working soon.</p>

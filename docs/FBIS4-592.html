			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg April 13 SAPA -- Former U.S. Secretary  of State Henry Kissinger and former British Foreign Secretary  Lord Carrington would not mediate if the date of elections was  included in the mediators' terms of reference, Mr Kissinger said  on Wednesday [13 April].    Speaking briefly outside a private Houghton home where the  two mediators met African National Congress President Nelson  Mandela, Mr Kissinger said the election date had not been  included in the terms of reference the seven mediators received  on Sunday.    The mediators are in South Africa to help mediate in the  election impasse between the ANC and the Inkatha Freedom Party  [IFP]. Mediation is expected to begin on Wednesday (today).    Mr Kissinger said the election date, or what Mr Mandela  called the "date of freedom for South Africa", was clearly not a  subject of mediation. He said the mediators were prepared only  to mediate on constitutional issues, the implementation of which  would be left to South Africans. His statement is likely to  cause concern in the IFP camp, which insists that the mediators  also consider changing the election to a later date to allow the  IFP a fair chance to campaign in the event the party decides to  participate.    Mr Mandela said he welcomed the government taking part in  mediation. An agreement could not be effective without the  involvemement of the government. The amended terms of reference  were reasonable, he said.    Mr Mandela also said the election date was not on the  agenda for mediation. The ANC, IFP and government would meet at  2 PM on Wednesday to come to a final agreement on the terms of  reference, he said.    The draft was a good document and a basis from which to move  on the question of mediation. "My own attitude is positive," Mr  Mandela said.    Lord Carrington said the mediators had come to South Africa  "to do what we can to help", but it would be up to South  Africans to find their own solutions. "There has been a  positive attitude on behalf of those we have seen," he said.</p>

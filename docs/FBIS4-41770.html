			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature; compiled by </F> Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy; Edited by Vladimir  Shishlin]    [Text] Aleksandr Lukashenko, the front runner of the first  round of elections in Belarus, believes that his victory was  tantamount to the vote of no confidence on the current Cabinet.  He told a press conference in Minsk that this could be seen  from the wide gap between the 45.1 percent he had scored and the  17.4 percent of the votes scored by Prime Minister Kebich.    He announced, however, that he would not remove all of the  current Cabinet members from their posts, if he won. According  to unofficial sources, Lukashenko is planning to offer the post  of prime minister to the current Economics Minister Sergey Ling.    Lukashenko's proxy, Chairman of the Parliamentary Commission  for Legislation Dmitriy Bulakhov, refused to comment on the  rumors about ballot rigging (according to which Lukashenko  scored 56 percent, not 45.1 percent of the votes, which would  have meant his complete victory - Interfax).    He also said that it was senseless to cast doubts on the  Central Electoral Commission's official reports, because he was  confident in Lukashenko's victory during the second round.    According to Interfax sources, Lukashenko's and Kebich's  teams are holding consultations with Zenon Poznyak, Stanislav  Shushkevich, Aleksandr Dubko and Vassiliy Novikov, who lost the  first round.    Viktor Ivashkevich, the proxy of leader of the People's  Front, said that Poznyak would not to go to the polling station  on the day of the second round. He also quoted Poznyak as  saying that the people had voted against the old system, but  failed to voice their support for the creation of a new one. He  announced that the leaders of the Belarusian People's Front  would meet on Saturday to decide which candidate to support  during the second round and whether to support anyone at all.    Sushkevich refused to comment on the current political  situation. Asked which candidate he would support, he said that  none of the first round wwinners had any scientifically  substantiated economic program. (Shortly, Shushkevich is  planning to set out for a tour of European countries, where he  will give a series of lectures at local universities -  Interfax).    Vassily Novikov and Aleksandr Dubko have not yet decided  whom  to support during the second round. At the end of the week, the  Central Committee of the Belarusian Communist Party is to hold a  plenary meeting to determine the party's position on the  elections. A spokesman for the Council of Collective Farms told  Interfax that Aleksandr Dubko was abroad and that in his absence  the agrarians could not decide whom to support during the second  round.</p>

			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Russian coup plot reports spark urgent Yeltsin talks Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister, cancelled talks with the head of the International Monetary Fund yesterday and flew to the Black Sea resort of Sochi for talks with President Boris Yeltsin, amid allegations of a coup plot. The prosecutor-general's office was yesterday investigating a document published in the liberal daily Obshchaya Gazeta at the weekend, which said that a group of senior officials had agreed to overthrow Mr Yeltsin because of his physical inability to fulfil his presidential duties. The Tass news agency quoted the prosecutor's office as saying all steps were being taken to check whether the report 'corresponds to reality'. In a brief editorial comment, Obshchaya Gazeta said the document appeared to be a fraud aimed at compromising top officials. The prosecutor general's office said if the report proved to be false, it would start legal proceedings on charges of slander. However, the allegations have been taken seriously and security services spent the weekend interrogating ministers. The alleged group, which included Mr Oleg Soskovets, the first deputy prime minister, General Mikhail Koslenikov, the head of the general staff, Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, the leader of the upper house, and Mr Yuri Luzhkov, the Moscow mayor, is a curious one, since most of its members have been close allies of the president. A senior official close to the Russian government said last night that there was some truth to the allegations - highlighting the degree of concern about President Yeltsin's ability to lead the country. However, Mr Soskovets had not been involved, he said, and had been named only as a way of removing him from the political scene. The same official said Mr Chernomyrdin had gone to the spa town of Sochi, where Mr Yeltsin is recuperating from a recent bout of ill health, to brief the president on the allegations. One of Mr Yeltsin's press spokesmen said Mr Chernomyrdin's unscheduled trip was no more than a routine meeting at a date convenient to both men. However, Mr Chernomyrdin broke an appointment with Mr Michel Camdessus, the IMF managing director, which had been on his schedule as late as Sunday night. The allegations of a plot caused alarm in the west, but officials in Washington said they could not verify the claims. The Obshchaya Gazeta report said Mr Yuri Skokov, the secretary of the Security Council, had been due to appear on Central TV on March 10 to proclaim Mr Yeltsin's unfitness to govern and present a video portraying Mr Yeltsin as a man 'in poor health, who also is drinking heavily'. At the same time, a parallel process was due to be set in train in parliament to transfer presidential powers to Mr Chernomyrdin. However, the head of Central TV refused the broadcast and informed the president's office. As a result, Mr Skokov and Mr Koslenikov went abroad, the report said. But the conspirators did not abandon their plan, instead seeking to persuade the head of state oil producer Gazprom, Mr R. Byakhirevo, to make the broadcast. The document also refers to circumstantial evidence of a coup plot, detailing the reluctance of the defence minister, General Pavel Grachev, to leave Moscow at the time. The influential daily Izvestiya in its main story today confirms that a plot had been hatched but says that 'once again a state coup did not take place'. Meanwhile, politicians said the upper echelons of government were in turmoil. Mr Boris Fyodorov, a former vice-premier, said that 'it's clear something is going on, and that the situation is very tense'. Hopes fade for Russia-IMF pact, Page 2 All fall down, Page 19</p>

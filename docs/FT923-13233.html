			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Trade explosion pushes Mercosur towards reality POLITICAL and economic instability in Brazil may yet scuttle attempts to form a common market in South America, or at least delay the January 1 1995 deadline for implanting a single market to be known as Mercosur between Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. None the less, an explosion in trade, cross-border business links, falling trade barriers and continuous advance in dull, but vital, regulatory harmonisation are giving integration a dynamic of its own. Companies ranging from powerful multinationals to small local companies are assuming that sooner or later Mercosur will become a reality. This perception is in turn accelerating integration. Mr Jorge Bustamante, director of Merchant Bankers Asociados, a Buenos Aires investment bank, says 'the impact of Mercosur here will be dramatic. (Brazil) may postpone matters, but people are taking Mercosur into account.' Multinationals were the first off the mark. The car industry began integrating operations in Brazil and Argentina in 1985. It is unlikely that Argentina's auto industry could have survived without access to Brazil's market. Today, all big car and component industries in Brazil and Argentina are integrating operations and sharing capacity. Integration is becoming a question of life or death for smaller players. In Argentina's industrial city of Cordoba, most companies have links with Brazil. Georgalos, a chocolate maker, has linked with Brazil's Lacta to exchange products and technology. Arcor, another food processing company, has a factory in Brazil and is expanding its distribution network for products made in Cordoba. Links between the two countries' service industry, farmers and financial systems are also growing stronger. These trends are reflected in the trade figures. In 1985, trade between the four Mercosur countries added up to Dollars 3.82bn (Pounds 199m). By 1991, trade was Dollars 10.60bn, accounting for 13 per cent of their total trade, even though huge obstacles to trade still exist. Paraguay's exports to its Mercosur partners tripled to Dollars 259m in 1991 from Dollars 82m in 1985, but its trade deficit widened by 12 per cent. Some Argentines think Brazil's crisis is too profound to find a rapid solution and advocate bilateral trade agreements with Chile, Mexico, the US and Canada and the European Community. Yet officials point out that only three years ago, Argentina - now enjoying a measure of economic stability - faced far greater unrest as the outgoing Alfonsin government collapsed amid food riots and hyper-inflation.</p>

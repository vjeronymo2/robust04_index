			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / Industry gambles on recovery and raises prices BRITISH manufacturers are gambling that recovery is in the air and are using the margin allowed by devaluation to raise their prices. Their defence is that they are trying to restore their shattered margins, or indeed climb out of loss. Critics reply that it is the old devaluation story: companies are throwing away long-term benefits for short-term profit. The justification varies from company to company. The simplest case is that of a German or French importer, for which devaluation represents a price cut in D-Marks or francs. The UK producer may be compensating for the higher cost of imported raw materials, or simply pushing up prices in line with the foreign competition. Evidence of price increases has been mounting steadily since the turn of the year. British Steel announced price rises last week of up to 13 per cent, giving as its reason previous sharp falls in steel prices and the rise in the cost of raw materials after devaluation. Increases announced by the company a year ago failed to stick; indeed European steel prices have fallen by 30 per cent since 1989. Pilkington, the glassmaker, announced price increases of 8 per cent for its standard float glass this week. If successful, this will be third time lucky for Pilkington, which tried to raise prices by 8 per cent in November 1991 and again by 7 per cent last June. In the event, UK prices have fallen by 30 per cent over three years. Industry analysts yesterday doubted whether the rises would stick, given over-capacity in the glass industry and the low level of construction orders. In the motor industry, the increases began with imported cars. Ford UK has just put up the prices of its Fiesta and Granada models - both made on the Continent - by 7.5 per cent after raising them by 2 per cent in October. Volkswagen of Germany has raised prices by 4.9 per cent having raised them by 2.9 per cent in November. Domestically produced cars, many of which have a high imported content, are starting to follow suit. Ford cut the prices of UK-built Fiestas and Escorts in October. It has now raised them by 4.5 per cent. Rover raised its prices last month by 2.9 per cent. In personal computers, prices have risen by up to 12.5 per cent since devaluation. The increases have come in both UK-produced PCs and imports. Siemens, the German electronics giant with UK sales approaching Pounds 1bn, said last week it had put through UK price increases of more than 7 per cent. Mr Jurgen Gehrels, chief executive of Siemens UK, said that cost increases of 15 per cent or more on imports from Germany represented 'a tremendous problem'. There are also important industries where there are still no signs of price recovery. Europe's chemical manufacturers have been trying to implement price increases since last summer, without success. RMC, the world's largest concrete manufacturer, said prices were now falling less steeply but were still some way from stabilising.</p>

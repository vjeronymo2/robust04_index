			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Havana, 2 Mar (PL) -- Regarding the Nation and  Immigration meeting which will be held in Havana, Foreign  Minister Roberto Robaina affirmed that those who will come to  Havana are those who respect us and do not ask for our heads.    Robaina reiterated that 200 emigrants living in 17 countries  will attend the meeting, scheduled for 22-24 April.    While speaking at a Higher Education Ministry seminar,  Robaina said not all the existing sectors will come to the  meeting, and not all the topics will be covered, but regarding  the organization, there will be a breadth that may surprise many.    The minister reiterated the nonattendance of those he termed  hysterical, when he referred to the fact that critics had laid  wagers the meeting would not be held, and he added, now they say  only our friends have been invited.    Robaina pointed out that among the topics on the agenda, in  order of importance, are matters that concern the Cuban  community, and he announced the creation of a system in the  ministry for dealing with the emigres.    He admitted that for many years in Cuba the topic of  immigration was very politicized, and said that recently,  departures from the country have increased due to economic and  family problems.    He pointed out that the most recalcitrant of the immigration  sectors have announced the collapse of the Cuban Government for  35 years and that message has wearied other residents living  abroad.    Referring to human rights, Robaina said that the United  States is preparing a new offensive on the topic, which is  debated in Geneva, and he said Cuba will not allow the entry of  any UN rapporteur.    Nevertheless, Robaina added that 14 Nobel Peace prize  winners  are invited to tour the length and breadth of the country.</p>

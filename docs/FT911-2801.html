			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / Books: Civil War revisited THE FALL OF THE BRITISH MONARCHIES, 1637-1642 by Conrad Russell Clarendon Press, Oxford Pounds 40, 550 pages CONRAD RUSSELL has something new to offer us in his approach to the too well-trampled ground of the Civil War and Puritan Revolution. England was only part of the problem, and the whole ghastly story has been seen too much in terms of simply England. 'England in 1637 was a country in working order, and was not on the edge of revolution.' Then how did it come about? The three kingdoms were fundamentally diverse. Yet in the 17th century people thought that diversity meant anarchy. The most inflammable source of diversity was religion. Rulers thought that the cure was to impose uniformity. We still have these problems with us to day. Look at Russia, the Middle East, Northern Ireland. Hindsight tells us that it was utterly impossible to impose uniformity in the three kingdoms - any more than it had been in the Netherlands. In England the majority held with the Anglican Church; in Scotland with the Presbyterians; in Ireland with the Catholics. Charles 1's attempt to achieve a measure of religious uniformity with England in Scotland produced a rebellion which he had not the means to suppress. So it was the Scots who triggered off civil war, and their intervention which turned the scales in England. Then they attempted to impose Presbyterian uniformity upon England] This was just as hopeless as Charles 1's attempt in Scotland. People rarely learn from political experience. It is an ironical, sad reflection upon human affairs that some sort of unity was eventually achieved by Cromwell only by force. And then it was against the majority in all three countries] Mr Russell's book gives one more to think about than any of the scores of books on the subject, mostly pro-Parliament, if not pro-Puritan. Russell is more fair to Charles 1, thinks he was not more 'duplicitous' than politicians are apt to be. As one reads one thinks of France in 1789, or Russia today - and Catherine the Great said that Russia was 'ungovernable'. Charles 1 found, or made, his kingdoms ungovernable. And one is impressed - as Churchill was - by the intractable complexity of the situation. Russell's book adds up to the old traditional view that it was the religious animosities that made it so. The Puritan hatred of Laud was well nigh insane. A leading MP speaks of the 'wicked tenets' of his Arminianism. This was because the poor Archbishop believed in free will, and regarded Calvinist Predestination, condemning the bulk of mankind to eternal damnation, as abhorrent to his soul. Of course he and Charles were more tolerant than they were, and more sympathetic to the Catholics in Ireland than they could possibly be to destructive Covenanters. A civilised man, Laud had been shocked by the devastation of the cathedrals in Scotland: he called it 'Deformation, not Reformation'. Puritans wanted to carry it further. A cultivated man, Charles wanted to restore the noble fabric of St. Andrews. Civil war merely carried destruction further all round. The conflicts of the time have their consequences today. The last words of the book read: 'As for Ulster, already in 1641 the crucible of the British problem, that is a place where the issue of this process is yet in the future.' Borne in upon one is the conclusion that human affairs, perhaps especially political, are often very silly. Especially in time of revolution, confusion, chaos.</p>

			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Consumer confidence underpins US growth US consumers' growing confidence is likely to underpin robust economic growth this year, figures yesterday indicated. The Conference Board said its index of consumer confidence rose 3.4 points to 83.2 in January. The index has risen 23 points since October, reflecting growth in the fourth quarter at an estimated annual rate of 6 per cent. Gross domestic product in the opening quarter will be distorted by arctic weather and the Los Angeles earthquake, but most forecasters believe the underlying growth rate is 3 per cent or slightly higher. In a separate report yesterday, the National Association of Realtors said sales of existing homes rose 6.7 per cent last month and by 11.1 per cent in the year to December. In 1993 as a whole, 3.8m previously-owned homes were sold, the highest level since 1979. The recovery appears to be putting little pressure on wage costs. The Labour Department yesterday said the employment cost index - which includes wages and fringe benefits - rose 0.8 per cent in the final quarter last year, the same rate as in the third period. Wage and benefit increases averaged 3.5 per cent in the 12 months to December, matching the previous year. Mr Fabian Linden, for the Conference Board, said the confidence figures reflected the increasing strength of the recovery. However, he noted an undercurrent of uncertainty about employment.</p>

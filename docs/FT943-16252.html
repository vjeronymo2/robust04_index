			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Good advance by shares but trading moderate - Market report A very buoyant start was made by UK equities yesterday to what promises to be an eventful week for global securities markets. Encouraged by firmness in bonds and in other European stock markets, shares moved ahead steadily as investors weighed the prospects for concerted action to stabilise the US dollar by the Group of Seven countries at next weekend's meeting in Naples. The FT-SE 100 Index closed a further 34 points higher at 2,970.4, about four points under the day's best. The broader market was also firm, taking the FT-SE Mid 250 Index ahead by 14.6 to 3,430.4. But trading volume was modest, and London, similar to other markets, showed the effects of the Independence Day closure in US markets. US Federal bonds, which have often held the key to trading in European bonds in recent weeks, were not traded in either New York or Tokyo yesterday. UK traders commented that the London market might not have been fully tested yesterday, and noted how quickly the Paris market turned off on bad news just before the close of business. Markets were also bracing themselves for the meeting today of the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee and for Thursday's routine policy meeting at the Bundesbank. Either the Fed or the Bundesbank could take action on interest rates, but markets heeded comments yesterday from the Bonn Finance Ministry that there might be no major initiative planned on dollar support. Shares opened quietly but extended gains in modest trade as UK government bonds rose. The markets remained optimistic on the outlook for the domestic economy, although some analysts expressed concern over the Item Club report which cast doubts on the upbeat forecasts of the UK Treasury. Retail stocks, including the leading store names, responded vigorously to the rise of 6 per cent in UK June M0 money supply, and were unperturbed by a significantly smaller increase in May credit business that had been expected. On balance, the statistics were seen as pointing the way to continued recovery in retail spending, regarded as the necessary base for sustained economic recovery. Seaq-reported trading volume for the day fell to only 483.3m shares from the 517.1m of the previous session. On Friday, retail, or genuine customer, business in equities was worth only Pounds 943.5m, one of the lowest daily figures for the year. By comparison, in the middle of last week, trading sessions recorded volume of more than 760m shares for a retail value of comfortably above Pounds 1bn. Corporate developments provided some features, mostly on the positive side of the market ledger. Vodafone strengthened after confirming increasing customer sales in the buoyant, if competitive, market for cellular phones. The repercussions, of the failed takeover bid in the oil sector continued, with Enterprise Oil sharply off following widespread criticism of the board's handling of the offer, while Lasmo, the escaped victim of Enterprise, moved ahead. Few strategists saw much reliable direction in the UK stock market until next week, when the outcome of the G7 meeting will have become known. But the underlying tone of the market apeared firm, with most UK stockbroking concerns predicting rises of around 11 per cent in the FT-SE 100 Index by the end of this year.</p>

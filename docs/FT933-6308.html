			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Pressings side leaves Braime lower Pre-tax profits of TF&amp;JH Braime (Holdings), the finished metal products, forging, pressing and stamping group, fell from Pounds 214,090 to Pounds 155,099 for the half year to June 30. Turnover improved from Pounds 2.78m to Pounds 3.3m. The fall in profits was due primarily to weak demand for products of Braime Pressings in the first quarter which left the subsidiary in loss for the half year. Currently, there are signs of recovery in demand for products of the pressings business. The directors said, however, that 'this gradual improvement, even if sustained, may have come too late to enable us to reach last year's level of profitability for the full year.' The interim dividend is being maintained at 2.25p from earnings per share of 6.9p (9.65p).</p>

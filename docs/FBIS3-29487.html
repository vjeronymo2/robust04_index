He made the comment in response to U.S. President Bill  Clinton's statement on Thursday that the U.S. will pursue an  "much more aggressive policy" to push Japanese markets open.    Clinton said he would try "different things" to achieve the  goal of opening Japan's markets.    Kumagai told reporters after a regular cabinet meeting that  the U.S. has often adopted such an attitude, even against old  allies like Britain, when trade talks were deadlocked.</p>

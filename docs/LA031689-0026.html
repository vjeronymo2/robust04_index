			<p><P> March 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OPTIONS ISRAEL WILL ALLOW FAIL THE WORKABILITY TEST  </P> <P> Any Israeli politician worth his salt has to propose his very own option --  sometimes two -- for a solution to the Palestinian issue. During the first week  in March, for example, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir suggested comprehensive  autonomy on one day, then promised annexation on the next; Labor's Shimon Peres  called for federation, and another prominent Labor minister suggested  unilateral withdrawal from Gaza for a starter.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the new Administration in Washington was assuring Israel that it  would not support a Palestinian state solution; President Bush is on record  supporting a Jordanian-Palestinian federation. And Yasser Arafat was  captivating his many visitors in Tunis with detailed descriptions of  Japanese-designed tunnels to link the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, the two  parts of the state he proposes.  </P> <P> These and many additional "options" have in common one crucial drawback: Those  who propose them appear to have made no serious effort to investigate their  strategic ramifications for Israel.  </P> <P> That was the purpose of a comprehensive study by the Jaffee Center for  Strategic Studies at Tel Aviv University. A team of more than 20 generals,  professors, researchers and former government ministers -- a membership whose  diverse views represent around 75% of Israeli public opinion -- labored for  eight months to produce detailed scenarios of the consequences for Israel of  adopting any of the options that are currently on the agenda. We asked  ourselves what the ramification for Israel would be if an Israeli government  were to seek to implement a given option -- what might we expect interms of war  risks, economic, demographic and geographic effects, the American and Soviet  reactions, the danger of internal conflict among Israeli leftists and  rightists, the reaction of Israel's own Arab sector (18% of its population) and  of the Arab world and the Palestinians?  </P> <P> We pondered whether an attempt by a rightist government to deport hundreds of  thousands of Palestinians might not generate a near-war between Israeli  leftists and rightists. And we assessed the reaction of Israeli soldiers upon  receiving orders to remove by force tens of thousands of Israeli settlers from  territory destined for a Palestinian state.  </P> <P> The results of our investigation are at once frightening and depressing: All of  Israel's current options are either not feasible or not advisable.  </P> <P> Annexation would catalyze war, isolation and civil strife; unilateral  withdrawal would be perceived as weakness, and would produce an instant  irredentist Palestinian state that owed Israel nothing in return; open-ended  autonomy would find no Palestinians willing to collaborate; a  Jordanian-Palestinian federation is no longer on Jordan's agenda (it never was  on the Palestinians'), and a Palestinian state that came into being without  extensive transition arrangements could catalyze war, terrorism and Israeli  domestic strife.  </P> <P> Israel, we concluded, remains stuck in a status quo that threatens escalating  war risks, growing loss of American support and rising domestic discontent. Yet  our leaders seem alarmingly incapable of taking bold new initiatives.  </P> <P> Our own ideas for a more realistic peace process left most of the politicians  predictably cold. The Likud and many in Labor did not like our call for the  government to talk directly with PLO-approved Palestinians, or our suggestion  that the eventual emergence of a demilitarized Palestinian state, surrounded by  Arab states at peace with Israel, need not threaten Israel strategically. Labor  continues to long for a Jordanian solution, while many on the left complain  that the 10- to 15-year transition period that we propose is unrealistic.  Palestinians argued that our demands on them -- demilitarization, border  alterations, rehabilitating the refugees to prove they have renounced their  claim to "return" to Israel -- were exaggerated.  </P> <P> The politicians were hardly expected to react otherwise to this academic  intrusion into policy-making. Perhaps, with time, some of our ideas will filter  through. But on a deeper level we feel that we have already provided everyone  concerned with a better yardstick with which to measure proposals for a  Palestinian settlement -- a model for assessing their strategic ramifications  for Israel.  </P> <P> The troubled Israeli breadwinner doing his two-month reserve stint in Nablus,  concerned American Jews, Palestinian Arabs -- all can now hold their leaders to  a higher standard. The politicians in Jerusalem, Washington and Tunis may not  like this either. But perhaps it will now be a little harder for them to ignore  the demand for more creative and responsible thinking on the Palestinian issue.  </P></p>

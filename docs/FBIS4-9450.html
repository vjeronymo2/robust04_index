			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, April 23 (CTK) -- The situation in the  former Yugoslavia was one of the main themes of his  conversations with French Defence Minister Francois Leotard,  Czech Defence Minister Antonin Baudys told journalists on his  return from France this evening.    He said Friday's NATO ultimatum was a stepping up of  pressure  on the Serbs to abandon their war attempts and to allow the  situation to be settled by diplomatic negotiation.    A new element in the ultimatum, he said, was that it no  longer referred to a single war area but was extended to all the  other areas mentioned in the relevant UN Security Council  resolutions.    Another of the main themes of his talks was the role of  Russia in contemporary Europe, Baudys said. The Czech Republic  had to be interested in the question, because Russia was still a  military superpower. They had talked about several features of  Russian military doctrine, and Leotard had told him about his  recent talks with Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev.    None of the information recently spread in the Czech media  that the smallpox virus had been stored in the Czech Republic  had been shown to be correct, Baudys said. However, he admitted  that a small quantity of the variola minor virus had been  stored. Variola minor causes an illness which is very close to  smallpox (variola maior), but which can have an easier course.    Baudys said that the spreading of such information, which  was  not based on the truth and yet concerned the credibility of the  state or created the impression of high insecurity was not  proper.</p>

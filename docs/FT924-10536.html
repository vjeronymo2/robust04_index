			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Wilton setting its sights on expansion Wilton Group is well on the way towards disposing of the bulk of its commercial property portfolio. That, and the improving position at Glenchewton, would 'place the company in a position to consider proposals for expansion within the near future,' said Mr Michael Buckley, chairman. Glenchewton is the 70 per cent-owned listed subsidiary, activities of which cover the wholesaling and distribution of toys, electrical components, hardware and housewares. Mr Buckley said Wilton had sold more than 50 per cent of its commercial property portfolio and the proceeds of Pounds 4.1m had reduced indebtedness. Most of the remaining Pounds 4m portfolio should be sold before the year-end, with further impact on borrowing. Reporting for the first half of 1992, Mr Buckley said the group incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 753,000 on turnover of Pounds 14.6m. That was not comparable with the previous profit of Pounds 68,000 on sales of Pounds 1.16m, as the latest figures included Glenchewton. Losses per share came to 0.15p (earnings 0.01p). Loss on disposal of property interests amounting to Pounds 1.34m was included in extraordinary charges. At Glenchewton, the ongoing rationalisation was producing improved results. The trading pre-tax loss, before exceptional items, was reduced to Pounds 489,000 (Pounds 679,000) on sales of Pounds 13.6m (Pounds 13.8m). A significant profit was expected in the second half.</p>

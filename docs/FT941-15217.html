			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / Ahtisaari wins first round in Finnish poll Mr Martti Ahtisaari, a senior United Nations diplomat, last night won the first round in Finland's presidential election, but will face a strong challenge in the final vote on February 6 from Mrs Elizabeth Rehn, the defence minister, who rode a late surge in popularity to take second place. If Mrs Rehn's popularity continues to grow at the rate it has increased recently she will stand a good chance of defeating Mr Ahtisaari in the run-off vote. His lead was provided by postal voting between January 5 and 11, before her support began to surge; she led among those who voted yesterday. Mr Ahtisaari, who led the UN's successful independence operation in Namibia, won 25.9 per cent of the first round vote, with Mrs Rehn taking 22 per cent. The two candidates from the main government coalition parties, Mr Paavo Vayrynen of the Centre party and Mr Raimo Ilaskivi of the Conservative party, trailed in third and fourth places with 19.5 per cent and 15.2 per cent respectively. The most remarkable feature was the success of Mrs Rehn, who three weeks ago was registering less than 10 per cent in the polls. Impressive television performances and an unorthodox grassroots campaign caught the imagination of Finnish voters seeking a new style of leadership after three years of the country's toughest recession for years. Both she and Mr Ahtisaari are keen supporters of Finland's application to join the European Union and project themselves as vigilant protectors of Finnish security - a key issue because of the political instability in neighbouring Russia, which previously ruled Finland. But they have markedly different approaches on the economy, which has shrunk by nearly 15 per cent since 1990, with unemployment rising to approaching 20 per cent. Mrs Rehn is likely to attract most right-of-centre voters, while Mr Ahtisaari advocates more government measures to tackle unemployment. In the second round, Mr Ahtisaari, with the might of the Social Democratic party behind him, will have much greater campaign resources than Mrs Rehn. She is backed by the tiny Swedish Peoples' party and a women's organisation called The First Lady. Many Finns may also hesitate to vote for her because she belongs to the small Swedish-speaking minority, which accounts for just 6 per cent of the population. If Mrs Rehn wins she will be the first ethnic Swede to be president since Marshal Gustav Mannerheim, a hero of Finland's military struggle for independence from Russia, who held the post in the mid-1940s.</p>

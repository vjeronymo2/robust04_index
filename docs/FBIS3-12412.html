Will  Washington bring us back the blood that has been shed? Or will  it, for that matter, protect us from Zionist crimes?    The United States is inviting us to Washington, contending  that peace will resolve all problems. Hence, it wants the  negotiators to sign an agreement there. It wants it to be said,  in a familiar media stunt, that an agreement has been reached,  that the United States is capable of resolving all problems, and  that both sides have been granted justice. The Palestinian  negotiators will have something to say on the occasion. They  will say the following: We have asked for U.S. intervention,  and we have obtained this intervention. We have signed the  agreement and that ends everything, thus the blood shed in  Hebron has not gone to waste. Much of this unconvincing talk  will be heard.    Attention will then be focused on how to find new answers to  justify the next massacre. This is the way things are being  handled and managed. How can the Palestinians accept this  thoroughly rotten and objectionable situation? How can the free  Palestinians accept all this misrepresentation of facts, all  this humiliation, and all this gratuitous death?</p>

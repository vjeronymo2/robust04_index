			<p><P> April 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JOSEPH WAMBAUGH  </P> <P> Wambaugh concedes that maybe we are too free as a nation, that we may have to  curtail our freedoms to a certain extent. At present, the Second Amendment  right to keep and bear arms is abused to the point that this area is a  battlefield. We need to leave the military assault weapons to the military and  exercise the Second Amendment rights in a reasonable manner.  </P> <P> GARY N. DARBY  </P> <P> Glendale  </P></p>

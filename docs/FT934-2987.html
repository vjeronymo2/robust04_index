			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / International Company News: Volkswagen revises loss forecast Volkswagen, the German carmaker, expects to lose DM2.3bn (Dollars 1.4bn) this year, some DM300m more than the company forecast two weeks ago. However, it aims to break even in 1994, according to Mr Ferdinand Piech, chairman. The turning point at the German parent, Volkswagen AG, had already been reached, he said yesterday, predicting 1993 net earnings of between DM60m and DM80m - around 50 per cent lower than last time. Mr Piech attributed the 'improvement' at the parent, which was reported as losing DM768m after nine months, to the delayed arrival of dividend payments from successful subsidiaries. These included Autolatina in Brazil, which has benefited from a 37 per cent rise, to 440,000 cars, in Latin American deliveries, and the Shanghai plant, which contributed to a 46 per cent rise in Chinese sales of 132,000 units. The VW AG result, he suggested, would allow the company to pay an unchanged DM2 dividend. Group turnover for 1993 would fall 10 per cent to DM77bn, well short of the expected DM80bn on which Mr Piech based his summer predictions of a break-even result. Full-year sales at the parent were likely to be 19 per cent lower at DM43bn. Group deliveries would drop 12 per cent to 3.1m vehicles. These had been hit by a 21.6 per cent decline in western Europe, where VW said it retained market leadership despite a one percentage point fall in market share, to 16.5 per cent. Mr Piech based his predictions for the new year on assumptions of unchanged volumes and enhanced profitability and productivity. He claimed group costs had already been reduced by DM6bn this year. Cost-saving measures include the shedding of 23,000 jobs worldwide and reduced prices for bought-in components. Capital investment was also reduced in the past year by 40 per cent to about DM5bn. Medium-term plans allow for further cuts, including a standstill on building and extension work at the company's new factory at Mosel in eastern Germany. Further savings are expected from the closure of a Barcelona factory owned by VW's Seat subsidiary, which will remove some 9,000 more workers from the payroll, and the planned introduction of a so-called four-day week in six German factories. However, negotiations over the Spanish closure are currently deadlocked, and Mr Piech has demanded a solution before the end of next week. Although talks on shorter working hours in Germany are still continuing, it is becoming apparent that annual savings will be less than the DM1.8bn expected, and that the 28.8-hour working week is only a stop-gap measure. Mr Piech said yesterday a return to 35-hour working was 'hardly likely' after the expiry of the planned two-year agreement currently being discussed.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From "Caracol's 0600 to 0900" newscast] </F>   [Excerpts] Early this morning terrorist groups opposed to  the peace agreement scheduled to be officially signed today at  approximately 1100 in the Granizal section of Medellin set fire  to approximately 10 buses, causing damage amounting to 115  million pesos. The peace agreement is between the government  and 600 militia members of Medellin's northeastern and  northwestern communities. [passage omitted]    With the support of the Army and the police, urban bus  services are gradually being restored to Medellin and the  surrounding communities. Currently the Granizal area is  cordoned off and heavily militarized. After 1000 this morning  in Granizales, during an event led by Government Minister Fabio  Villegas Ramirez, the peace agreement will be signed by three of  Medellin's five popular militias. This translates into the  demobilization and disarmament of approximately 650 men from the  three armed groups.    [Paris AFP in Spanish at 1318 GMT on 26 May reports that  three taxis and 10 buses were burned. No injuries or fatalities  were reported. The report says that bus service in Medellin has  been drastically reduced because of fear among bus drivers and  owners that their vehicles might be targeted, adding that  authorities believe that the escalation of guerrilla activities  is related to the 29 May elections.]</p>

A Finance Ministry source said that US Treasury Secretary  Lloyd Bentsen is expected to repeat the call at his meeting with  Finance Minister Tharin Nimmanhemin on January 19. The topic  will be on the agenda, which includes a double taxation  avoidance treaty, the bilateral Treaty of Amity, and the  Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.    Last year, U.S. officials urged their Thai counterparts to  introduce a law to prevent money laundering, following bilateral  talks on how to curb the narcotics trade. At that time,  Thailand informed the U.S. that it would consider the matter.    The source, however, noted that the Thai government is  unlikely to introduce such a law as it would burden local  financial institutions. Another source noted that it might be  difficult for the government to even pass the required bill in  the current political situation.    Moreover, Thailand currently has some laws related to money  laundering practices. The first source added that the  introduction of a new law might run counter to the country's  plan to move towards financial liberalization since it would  lead to restrictive regulations on the remittance of money.    At any rate, the Finance Ministry has set up a working  committee to study the pros and cons of such a law and whether  it's timely for the country to introduce a bill. Recently,  Finance Ministry officials also flew to Singapore to discuss  procedures in that country's money-laundering act.    Singapore is the only ASEAN country which has a  money-laundering act because, being a free-port nation, the  industrialized island sees a need for tight control of money  remittances.    The source said that Secretary Bentsen is likely to urge  Thailand to introduce a bill by citing the healthy growth of the  economy, Bangkok's current financial liberalization and its  ambition to become a regional financial centre.</p>

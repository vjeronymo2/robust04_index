			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Quaker Oats selling Sutherlands Quaker Oats Company is to sell the Sutherlands Foods division to C Shippam of Chichester, a subsidiary of Pet Incorporated. Sutherland produces savoury spreads and pastes, but Quaker said those had little strategic fit within the core businesses. Its net assets at June 30 were Pounds 3.1m. Shippam said it will capitalise on the expertise of both businesses to offer a comprehensive range of savoury sandwich filling products with a wider distribution base.</p>

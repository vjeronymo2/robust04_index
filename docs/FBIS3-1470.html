He said he  was at the meeting at the Library Gardens when the shooting  started.    Both Mr Lorimer and National Peace Secretariat Chairman Dr  Antonie Gildenhuys had marched through the middle of the crowd  on its way to the rally and "the crowd was at that stage in a  fairly good mood", Mr Lorimer said. "There was nothing that we  saw that could have induced shooting.    "Suddenly, out of the blue, shooting started. I did not know  where it came from. Some of it was from the ground and some  from the buildings around the gardens," Mr Lorimer said, adding  that police then trained their fire on buildings, breaking many  upper storey windows. The crowd took cover and Dr Gildenhuys  and I ended face-down in flower beds in the gardens while an  impi [Zulu word for warrior] ran over my back," he said.    Although Mr Lorimer was not at the scene of the carnage at  the African National Congress head office, Shell House, where  eight people were killed, he said the shooting there was not a  Zulu attack.    According to people Mr Lorimer spoke to, someone started  firing from buildings opposite and around Shell House and the  crowd retaliated, he told SAPA.    Mr Lorimer also believed there were agents provocateur in  the  crowd, as he had been warned by the IFP before the march. He  said both the Peace Secretariat and the police had difficulty  placing their men in the crowd because both organisations were  operating on rumours about the march.    Mr Lorimer said he had seen a large number of "sticks,  assegais [jabbing spear] and homemade spears, but no firearms  among the marchers".</p>

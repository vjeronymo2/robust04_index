			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Lufthansa Lufthansa's deal with the German government over how future pension liabilities are to be split has paved the way for a decisive break with its public sector past. The airline's culture has changed over the past two years as top management has realised that a low cost base is essential in an increasingly competitive industry. But Lufthansa's profile in international capital markets has inevitably been affected by the government's majority stake - something which could not change so long as the pension issue was unresolved. Now, though, Bonn is free to sell its stake, while the airline can press ahead with its own rights issue. This comes at a good time, as Lufthansa's profit and loss account is being transformed by the twin effects of strong recovery in demand and vigorous cost-cutting. The group is expected to move marginally into profit in the current year and strongly thereafter. Some of this story is already incorporated in the share price, which has outperformed the DAX index by more than 50 per cent in the past year. But there is room for more. Using the yardstick of market capitalisation to turnover, Lufthansa does not look expensive. Its ratio of 35 per cent is similar to KLM's but less than half that of British Airways. BA, of course, deserves a higher rating because its structural changes are much further advanced than those of its continental rivals. But the wide gap in the ratings shows the possible upside in Lufthansa's share price if it can catch up.</p>

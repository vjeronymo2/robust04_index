			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Viktor Litovkin report: "Military Lawyers To Handle </F> Zhirinovskiy Case"]    [Text] The criminal proceedings instituted against LDPR  [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] leader Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy for spreading war propaganda have been handed over  by the Russian General Prosecutor's Office to the Main Military  Prosecutor's Office for investigation.    We called Valentin Panichev, chief of the Russian Federation  General Prosecutor's Office Main Administration for the  Supervision and Implementation of Laws in the Armed Forces, and  asked him to comment on this fact. But the chief military  prosecutor declined to give a straight answer to the question of  why the Zhirinovskiy case has been handed over to military  lawyers. He said that it had been a decision by the general  prosecutor, who is entitled to task any law-enforcement organ  with investigating a particular case.    Meanwhile independent experts believe that the Zhirinovskiy  case has been handed over to the Main Military Prosecutor's  Office for several reasons. One of these is the fact that the  Ministry of Security is currently being reorganized and,  although this is their job, nobody can currently be spared to  deal with Mr. Zhirinovskiy. Others believe that the  investigation has been handed over to the military because the  most skilled specialists currently available are working in the  Main Military Prosecutor's Office. Nor can we rule out the  explanation that the LDPR leader was a KGB officer before he  embarked on political activity; thus he basically remains a KGB  officer, even though now transferred to the reserves, and his  problems have to be dealt with by investigators from the  Military Prosecutor's Office.    Whichever version is correct, it is clear that the case  against the State Duma deputy and leader of one of the biggest  Duma factions was instituted 26 January in connection with the  publication of his book "Last Dash to the South," which, in the  lawyers' opinion, contains elements of war propaganda. Article  71 of the RSFSR Criminal Code places propaganda of this sort in  the category of particularly dangerous state crimes and  stipulates punishment in the form of a three- to eight-year jail  term.    The editorial office has learned that investigators from the  Main Military Prosecutor's Office have concluded their study of  the text of Mr. Zhirinovskiy's literary work and have proceeded  to the stage of gathering the necessary documentation and  interrogating witnesses. The LDPR leader himself has not yet  been summoned to the Main Military Prosecutor's Office on  Kholzunovskiy Pereulok.</p>

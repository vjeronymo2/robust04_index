			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / Major hails investment fruits of his Indian trip BRITISH Prime Minister John Major, seeking to promote British business during a visit to India, yesterday hailed planned investments by British Gas and British Aerospace and a proposed bilateral business discussion group as the first fruits of his trip. After a meeting with Mr PV Narasimha Rao, the Indian prime minister, Mr Major said both countries would benefit from greater economic co-operation. British investment in India would help India's economic reform, while export growth would lead Britain's economic recovery. The prime minister was speaking on the eve of celebrations today to mark India's Republic Day, at which he is the chief guest. Security cover for the event was tightened yesterday following the arrest of four Sikh militants who were allegedly planning to plant a bomb in New Delhi. Mr Major said he was 'entirely content' with security arrangements. But he acknowledged that the threat of an incident may have been increased by the recent signing of an extradition treaty between the UK and India, which would ease the extradition of suspected Indian terrorists from Britain. However, Delhi police said the level of security cover was normal for a Republic Day celebration as was the level of risk of an attack from terrorists. Mr RS Sahay, the additional deputy commissioner of police, who is in charge of security, said: 'Terrorist groups would want to attack at a time like this (Republic Day). John Major is no particular target.' Mr Major's security cover was 'the same as for any other head of state,' Mr Sahay said. The prime minister, who is accompanied by a delegation of senior British businessmen, is anxious to link the visit to commercial successes for UK companies. The two deals he cited yesterday are relatively modest. British Gas is planning to take a 35 per cent stake in a joint venture to supply natural gas to Bombay, India's biggest city. British Gas and its partners will invest Pounds 100m, spread over 10 years. British Aerospace, the aerospace and engineering group, will take a 40 per cent stake in a software company to be set up with Hindustan Aeronautics, the Indian aerospace company. The total equity investment is Rs60m (Pounds 1.35m). The bilateral business discussion group was announced by Mr Major after his talks with Mr Rao. It is to consist of British and Indian businessmen and will be chaired by Mr Robert Evans, chairman of British Gas. The group is to consider measures to promote two-way trade and investment and to report back to the two prime ministers at the end of the year. Mr Howard Davies, director general of the CBI, welcomed Mr Major's help for exports. 'We have been asking for more government help for exports for some time. Now we are getting it. 'The business community is very chipper. For many of them this (trip) has been a nice little earner.' Mr Major said in a speech last night that India's far-reaching economic reforms would continue to open up significant new opportunities for business and investment. At a banquet given by Mr Rao, Mr Major praised India's efforts to liberalise its economy. He referred obliquely to the violence and political turmoil which has hit India since the destruction of the Ayodhya mosque, saying that Britain supported 'the work of safeguarding the fabric of Indian life so successfully created over many years'.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "rb": "Declining Wages Slow Down Economy"] </F>   [Text] Frankfurt -- Declining consumer demand might prove  to be the main threat to the West German economy this year.  Demand is being slowed down by three factors: "zero wage  rounds," growing unemployment, and increasing public expenditure  with stagnating social benefits cutting purchasing power. This  has been pointed out by research institutes the Ifo and the  German Institute for Economic Research [DIW], as well as the  Association of German Retailers (HDE).    Gross wages and salaries are expected to go up by an average  of 1.6 percent in 1994, the latest weekly report of the DIW  says, compared with an increase of 2.5 percent in 1993. The  Munich-based Ifo Institute expects similar figures: In view of  growing pension contributions and other fees, employees' net  take-home pay will be 1.5 percent down on last year, a cut of 10  billion German marks [DM], the researchers say. This takes into  account declining employment figures, which will result in an  estimated loss of earnings of some DM20 billion, according to  the Ifo.    The HDE thinks that this means bleak prospects for their  trade: "Contrary to various graffiti in the toilets  [Latrinengeruschte], existing conditions will not allow the  retail trade to recover quickly from the trough," HDE manager  Hubertus Tessar said before the "Premiere" trade fair in  Frankfurt. After a decline in turnover by a nominal 2.5  percent, a real 4.5 percent, to DM760 billion, he thinks that  the 1994 figures will not show much improvement: "The  purchasing power of German consumers will decrease below the  1990 level." Owing to this development, some 30,000 jobs will  be lost in the retail trade by December.    Tessar does not think much of Bonn politicians. Not only  does the state plunder the purses of private households by means  of higher taxes, but the latest deregulation plans -- especially  yesterday's decision to abolish the rebate law and the  relaxation of shop-closing regulations -- "encourage  concentration and endanger innumerable medium-size retail shops."    In connection with the risks to the economy resulting from  this, the Berlin-based DIW warns against a "zero round" in wage  policy. In contrast to "expected wage settlements of  approximately 2 percent," this would result in "declining  demand, and thus a fall in capacity utilization." This "will  not make companies step up investment." In addition, the  government's austerity policy aggravates the slack demand, and  monetary policy does not do much in terms of countering this by  way of cutting interest rates. On the other hand, says the DIW,  in the event of a "zero round," prices "would not go up much  less than with the expected wage settlements, owing to the great  impact of administrative price increases and rent increases."    The Ifo Institute is somewhat more optimistic. It says that  the economic climate has improved recently. Equipment and  capital investment should go up by 2 percent in 1994. West  German exporters could expect gains "particularly in markets  outside West Europe." In private consumption, the Ifo expects a  real decline of 1 percent.</p>

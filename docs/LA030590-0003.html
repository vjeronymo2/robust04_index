			<p><P> March 5, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GABRIEL KATZKA; EMMY-WINNING PRODUCER, 59  </P> <P> Gabriel Katzka, a theater, film and TV producer known worldwide for his ability  to raise money for entertainment projects, has died of a heart attack at his  Upper East Side home in New York City.  </P> <P> Katzka was 59 when he died Feb. 19, his sister, Benji K. Green of Woodland  Hills, said last week.  </P> <P> From "An Evening With Nichols and May" on Broadway to his recent Emmy-winning  television miniseries, "Ellis Island," Katzka's projects represented a wide  cross-section of entertainment.  </P> <P> His theatrical presentations included Richard Burton as "Hamlet," Liv Ullmann  as "Anna Christie" and the "Comedians," directed by Mike Nichols.  </P> <P> He also was co-producer of "Barefoot in the Park," "Things That Go Bump in the  Night" and "Hughie."  </P> <P> Katzka's films included "The Taking of Pelham One, Two, Three," "Marlowe,"  "Soldier Blue," "Who'll Stop the Rain," "Butch and Sundance: The Early Days,"  "The Beast Within," "The Lords of Discipline" and "The Falcon and the Snowman."  </P> <P> A Los Angeles Times series of articles in 1978 told how Katzka used his  professional contacts and friends to help finance the film "Meteor," which  starred Sean Connery, Natalie Wood and Henry Fonda in a disaster drama.  </P> <P> He was described at that time as "a wizard in raising money for and production  of Broadway shows and motion pictures."  </P> <P> Katzka came by his ability naturally, for his father had been a trial lawyer  who invested regularly in Broadway productions.  </P> <P> In addition to his sister, he is survived by his wife, Carol, and a son.  </P> <P> A memorial service is scheduled March 11 at the Beverly Wilshire at 1 p.m.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NO DIPLOMACY NECESSARY  </P> <P> My Sunday morning ritual of reading the Travel Section of The Times was ruined  by the front page article "Hidden Venice: The First Jewish Ghetto," (May 6).  The article describes a group of Italian tourists visiting the old Jewish  ghetto in Venice, Italy.  </P> <P> The following dialogue takes place: "Why did people discriminate against Jews  in the first place?" asks one woman. "Because they killed Christ," says a  second. "But that was a Roman proceeding. The whole thing was done by the  Romans. Isn't that right?" a third demands. . .the guide responds  diplomatically: "Perhaps it would be better to talk with a rabbi."  </P> <P> My points are the following:  </P> <P>  -- Why does the guide have to respond diplomatically? Doesn't he know that the  Jews did not kill Christ and that the Vatican declared this officially years  ago? If he doesn't, he should not be in the position of educating  impressionable people.  </P> <P>  -- In the article, no rabbi is ever consulted. The debate is left unsettled in  the minds of the tourists and in the minds of your readers.  </P> <P>  -- Why even print such out-dated anti-Semitic rhetoric in the first place?  </P> <P> SHARI FINN LECKER  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

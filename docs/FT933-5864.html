			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Reinsurance The flow of insurance capital into Bermuda must be galling for Lloyd's of London as it tries to attract new blood of its own. The latest venture, backed by Swiss Re with the promise of an international equity offering to come, brings new capital committed this year to Bermuda to around Dollars 2bn. Most new Bermudan operations will reinsure catastrophe risks, an area of the London market decimated by the string of natural disasters culminating in Hurricane Andrew. Since demand for catastrophe reinsurance is growing, it is only natural that fresh capital should fill the gap. The benign Bermudan tax regime and the opportunity to invest in a new venture with a clean sheet is proving a powerful attraction. In contrast Lloyd's is still struggling with prior year losses and the threat of litigation. So long as capital remains scarce, offshore centres like Bermuda might complement rather than challenge the London market. Additional reinsurance capacity should allow Lloyd's underwriters to place additional business. In the hunt for additional capital to shore up the capacity of Lloyd's itself, though, Bermuda has emerged as a serious competitor. With catastrophe reinsurance rates more than doubling in many areas, and even good-quality insurers still struggling to find sufficient cover, the case for more capacity seems persuasive. But whether catastrophe rates are now sufficient to cover the risk remains a moot point. One reading of the recent claims record is that climatic change has made the world altogether more risky than in the past. Such doubts might explain Swiss Re's willingness to share the risks with outside investors rather than taking the best of the business for itself.</p>

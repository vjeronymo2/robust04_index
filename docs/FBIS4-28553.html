In reference to Chinese President Jiang Zemin's remarks  during an exclusive NHK interview today, Foreign Ministry  spokesman Terusuke Terada indicated at a news conference this  evening that in the course of a planned meeting between Japanese  and Chinese foreign ministers, the Japanese Government intends  to directly sound out the Chinese Government regarding its views  on possible UN sanctions against the DPRK, as well as how the  PRC plans to deal with the issue in the future. Terada said: We  expect that discussions will naturally be held on how the PRC  will respond in case the UN Security Council should adopt a  resolution to impose sanctions against the DPRK. In the course  of these discussions, the Japanese Government, for its part,  intends to directly sound out the Chinese Government regarding  how it views these matters and what course of action it plans to  take diplomatically.</p>

			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: When it's time to get personal - Planning Your Pension MILLIONS of employees do not have access to a good company pension scheme. The alternative, introduced in July 1988, is the personal pension. These replaced the old-style, self-employed retirement annuities but - most important - allowed individual employees to contract out of the state earnings-related pension scheme (Serps). In return, they could get a rebate of National Insurance (NI) contributions to invest in a plan of their choice. This used to be possible only through membership of an occupational scheme which was contracted out. Where no company scheme operated, employees were in Serps automatically. Today, almost 5m employees have personal pensions. There are two component parts of a personal pension (although, for the sake of convenience, providers tend to lump these together in one policy). The appropriate personal pension is used to contract out of Serps, while a top-up pension is used to take extra contributions above the contracted out rebate. Like all pension arrangements approved by the Inland Revenue, the personal plan is an extremely tax-efficient way to save for retirement. Contributions up to generous limits qualify for full tax relief, the pension fund itself grows free of tax, and up to 25 per cent of the total fund at retirement can be taken as tax-free cash. The rest of the fund must be used to buy an annuity to provide the retirement income. The pension can be drawn at any age between 50 and 75, and these annuity payments are taxed as income. Personal pensions do not provide a pension linked to final salary, as is the case with most company schemes. Instead, the plans operate on a money purchase basis. This means that your contributions are invested. The value of the annuity you buy on retirement will depend on how well the fund has performed and how much the provider has taken out by way of charges. Almost anyone over the age of 16 can take out a personal pension provided they have earned income. To understand how the personal pension works, it is best to examine the plan in its two component parts. 'Appropriate' personal pensions These are designed for three main categories of employees: 1. Those who do not have access to an occupational scheme. 2. Those whose company scheme is 'contracted in' to Serps (ie, where the scheme benefits are paid in addition to the Serps pension). 3. Younger workers who expect to change jobs often and need a portable pension. (The portability feature has drawbacks which will be discussed in more detail next week). If you are under 35 and in one of these categories, you should consider contracting out of Serps with an appropriate personal pension. This is because the value of the rebate is higher than the Serps' benefits you give up. These benefits do not build up at a flat rate but increase as you get older. They also differ for men and women. The rebate is a flat rate and, therefore, represents a better deal for younger employees. But the decision to remain contracted out should be reassessed each year. The rebate is calculated as a percentage of an employee's 'middle band earnings' - ie, earnings between the lower and upper threshold for NI contributions. For the present tax year, the NI thresholds are Pounds 2,808 and Pounds 21,060 per annum, giving middle band earnings of Pounds 18,252. The rebate for the 1992/93 tax year is 8.47 per cent of these earnings, giving a maximum of Pounds 1,546 to those who earn Pounds 21,060 or more during this period. The 8.47 per cent includes a 2 per cent bonus to encourage employees to opt out of Serps. The rebate is sent by the DSS direct to your personal pension provider after the end of the tax year to which it relates. From April 1993, the rebate will be reduced to 4.8 per cent, plus an element of tax relief. The 2 per cent bonus will stop, but employees age 30 and over will still receive an extra 1 per cent. There are restrictions on how the fund built up from the NI rebates - known as the protected rights fund - can be used. It cannot be used to provide tax-free cash and, in most cases, the pension must be taken at the same age as the state pension, now 60 for women and 65 for men. The annuity bought with the fund must provide for a 50 per cent spouse's pension, and the annuity payments must increase by 3 per cent a year. Many of these restrictions do not apply to the fund derived from contributions paid in addition to the rebate. In particular, up to 25 per cent of this fund can be taken as tax-free cash. Top-up personal pensions In addition to the rebate, employees can contribute a significant proportion of their annual earnings into a personal pension. The limits are: Up to age 35: 17.5 per cent; 36-45: 20 per cent; 46-50: 25 per cent; 51-55: 30 per cent; 56-60: 35 per cent; 61-74: 40 per cent. It is possible to run more than one top-up personal pension plan provided total contributions fall within these limits. But an employee can only have one appropriate plan for each tax year. Within the prescribed limits, employers can contribute to an individual employee's plan, although there is no legal requirement to do so. Employees in a company scheme who have earnings from a second source can also take out a personal pension in respect of these earnings. High earners with personal pensions are restricted by the 'earnings cap,' introduced in the 1989 Budget, which limits the amount of salary that can be taken into consideration for contributions. For the 1992/93 tax year the cap is Pounds 75,000. It is also possible to use up to 5 per cent of the contribution limit to pay for life assurance which, effectively, gives you tax relief on the premiums. A special provision exists for employees and the self-employed who have unused tax relief in previous years. Under the Inland Revenue's 'carry back' and 'carry forward' rules, it is possible to mop up unused relief for up to seven previous tax years. This should be discussed with a tax expert. Finally, personal pension plans can be used to accept a transfer value from a preserved company pension although this is a complex issue and, again, expert help is essential. Personal pensions are available from a range of financial institutions but the market is dominated by the life offices. A few unit trust groups and friendly societies also offer personal pensions, while the banks and building societies tend to sell life office plans. Next week, we examine the different types of personal pensions available and explain how your money is invested. We also examine providers' charges and explain how to secure the best deals in terms of flexibility and portability.</p>

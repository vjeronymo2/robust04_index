			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Vietnam 'enters tougher phase': World Bank clears Dollars 150m loan Vietnam's economic adjustment programme is entering a more demanding phase now that relatively easy price reforms have been accomplished, the World Bank said yesterday. Announcing the approval of a Dollars 150m, 40-year structural adjustment loan, its fourth to Vietnam since lending resumed last year, the bank singled out restructuring of state banks, privatisation of public companies and trade reform as still to be tackled. Vietnam should also introduce further legal reform to provide a basic civil and commercial law code and simplify investment rules to facilitate business activity. The reform programme had produced 'impressive results', especially since it was begun without real outside financial help. But 'some weaknesses are evident in the reform programme and in the economy'. Vietnam remained a poor country with per capita income below Dollars 200 a year and sharp regional disparities in living standards. Weak infrastructure and an inefficient financial system hindered investment. International donors could provide significant finance for development, but the government would need effective institutions to take most advantage of development assistance. The financial sector was burdened by bad debts in state-owned commercial banks, poor accounting and management practices, and high taxation. The trade system should be reformed to abolish import permits and introduce a simplified tariff structure. This year Vietnam is committed to reducing its fiscal deficit to 2.7 per cent of GDP from 6.2 per cent in 1993. It is expected to rise to 3.3 per cent in 1995.</p>

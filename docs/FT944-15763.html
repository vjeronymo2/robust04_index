			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Observer: Vision of an empty chair The Millennium Commission has made a decision. The body entrusted with dispensing Pounds 1.6bn to mark the new era may be lamentably ill-equipped to explain how it plans to spot things millennialistic. What it can say is that the man picked less than two months ago as its chief executive - Nicholas Hinton from Save the Children Fund - is unsuitable for the job. And he was only meant to start today. One can imagine what happened. The nine commissioners, a geographically representative but not especially eminent band of worthies, have been travelling the country together soliciting ideas - and bolstering their own sense of importance as the vastness of their financial power sinks in. Along comes Hinton, a man accustomed to throwing his weight around after nearly a decade building Save the Children. He threatens to have an opinion or two, so is sent packing as summarily as an unsuccessful supplicant for an Arts Council grant. Back to the drawing board, then, with the advertisement for a boss who, first time around, was supposed to possess 'presence, authority and ingenuity'. Obviously a misprint for a kow-towing wallflower masquerading as a yes-man. Meanwhile, the commissioners might care to consider that, while they understandably wish to wallow in the glory of picking the dozen or so really big projects, the bulk of the funds is destined for a multiplicity of rather less glamorous, but in the end much more significant, endeavours. When it is time to choose those, that may be the moment when the bigwigs regret letting Hinton go.</p>

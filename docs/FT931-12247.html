			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Barter deals help to bridge CIS grain gap / A way that has been found round the region's debt problem THE US grain industry is in a peculiar position. Its best customer is strapped for cash, has a cumulative global debt in the area of Dollars 80bn and is Dollars 245.9m in arrears on US government-guaranteed loans for grain already purchased. Worse, the customer, the former Soviet Union, is struggling toward democracy and is a wounded giant in need of assistance. Rather than abandon the Commonwealth of Independent States entirely, the US Department of Agriculture has quietly found a way to resume selling wheat to Russia and its surrounding Republics. Longer-term solutions to Russia's debt problems may be working their way through the new government in Washington, but until then, barter is gaining currency in the world wheat trade. The US has sold 1.4m tonnes of US wheat to CIS countries since September under a little-known barter clause of its much larger Export Enhancement Program. When Russia's failure to meet US loan payments shut down mainstream credit programmes in late November, EEP barter sales increased markedly. Initial allocations for the special programmes provided for 500,000 tonnes of US wheat for the CIS, but when that allocation was exhausted, additional allocations were transfered from Russia's 5.5m tonne overall EEP allocation. Russia still has 1.75m tonnes of EEP credits to draw upon, according to USDA officials. The programme allows a third-party country to buy US wheat to balance a barter transaction, perhaps oil or metals, with a CIS country. To date Uzbekistan, rather than Russia, has been the primary barter recipient. The most recent sale was recorded yesterday - 110,000 tonnes of wheat for shipment between February and April. The switch to barter, rather than credit or cash arrangements by the grain trade to the CIS is not surprising. The countries are resource-rich and cash poor, and still very much in need of imported grain. In a report issued today, the International Wheat Council called for grain exporting countries to try new solutions to the CIS's credit problems. 'Given the overwhelming importance of the CIS market, it seems likely that the major exporting grain exporting countries will seek every more inventive ways of servicing it,' the report said. 'The alternative could be a total default on current debt,' it added. Russia has been awaiting new credits for 2.5m tons of cereals from France, but terms of the guarantees have stalled the deal. Canada, the world's other large wheat exporter, long ago suspended wheat shipments to the CIS. The IWC has projected that the CIS would import 28m tonnes of grain in the 1992-93 marketing years, down from 37.8m last year.</p>

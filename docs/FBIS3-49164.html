"Foreign hegemonic leaders and their domestic lackeys are  spreading again reports on the danger of dictatorship, that the  premier is not bearable for abroad and for the `sobered-up'  society and that he is allegedly unbearable even for the  Hungarian partners, that the situation demands a complaisant and  servile `expert' government which would `listen' more to the  great-Hungarian and Czechoslovakist advice," Huska says. "It  contradicts the Czech interests because (the current Slovak  Government) does not want to accept the forged balance of the  Czechoslovak State Bank which made Slovakia a debtor instead of  creditor. The attack on the inconvenient government is also a  punishment for the fact that we dared to emancipate ourselves,"  he states.    According to Huska, "the great power vacuum awakened the  egoistic ambitions of our southern neighbor. It is blindly  striding towards the vision of at first a `mid-sized' and then a  Great Hungary. Should we create because of these unruly  interests a less resistant government?"    "The American senators and congressmen for the Democratic  Party told us openly in early December that the only reasonable  policy is not to comply with foreign hunger for territory, it is  a radical, unyielding, transformation-minded government which  defends the interests of the Slovak society. They told us that  when up against foreign interests, the most successful and  efficient are unyielding and incorruptible authorities," Huska  claims.    "The stability of the Slovak Government system is the  supreme  priority of our freedom, it means more than anything else for  us," Huska concludes.</p>

			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Working hours in decline Sir, Samuel Brittan wonders (Economic Viewpoint, March 17) what has happened to the total number of hours of work being performed during the output recovery - when the continuing reduction in full-time employment is set against the rise in part-time and self-employment. The answer can be obtained from the household Labour Force Survey, the results of whose autumn 1993 enquiry have just been published in a volume which also contains for the first time estimates of average actual weekly hours of work by sector of activity, for men and women - a continuation of an established series on hours worked by employment status. In autumn 1993, a total of 830.1m hours of work were performed weekly - a slight reduction on autumn 1992 (the best period for comparison using these seasonally-unadjusted data). In fact, hours worked were down in each quarter of 1993 relative to 1992 - though by an amount that is well within sampling error. Total hours worked are now some 15 per cent below the spring 1990 peak - one possible measure of the 'output gap' (always bearing in mind that unemployment was unacceptably high even at the peak of the previous upswing). The Labour Force Survey also contains the information that: the total of International Labour Organisation unemployed non-claimants, 1.037m, is 59,000 up on a year earlier; ILO unemployed 16- and 17-year-olds (mostly ineligible to claim benefit) stands at 146,000 - 7,000 higher than a year earlier; while the number of 'discouraged' workers (those who would like to work but have not looked as they believe no jobs are available) stands at 184,000 - 8,000 more than a year ago. ILO unemployment among ethnic minority men stands at 24 per cent: Afro-Caribbeans (33 per cent), Indians (16 per cent) and Pakistani/Bangladeshis (30 per cent).

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["News Analysis" by Tan Jianrong: "Bumpy Road Ahead for Hata </F> Cabinet"]    [Text] Tokyo, April 25 (XINHUA) -- The new cabinet to be  formed by Tsutomu Hata later today will have a rough sailing as  attainment of policy consensus may not be easy despite the  policy platform they have agreed on for a new government,  political analysts here said.    Hata, 58, will formally succeed Morihiro Hosokawa as Japan's  51st prime minister and inaugurate his own cabinet, the second  coalition cabinet since last August, this evening.    The leader of the coalition's core party Shinseito (Japan  Renewal Party) faces mounting political and economic problems  both at home and abroad. He will have to undertake the tax  system reform, pass the overdue fiscal 1994 budget, reactivate  the sluggish economy, intensify deregulation, and ease Japan's  trade friction with the United States and the suspected nuclear  issue on the korean peninsula.    Policies on two key issues -- the tax system reform and  Japan's response to the alleged nuclear development program in  the Democratic People's Republic of Korea -- had been the focus  of heated negotiations among the coalition partners over the  past two weeks, causing turmoil in Japanese politics and  delaying the inauguration of a new government.    Analyst Jiro Yamaguchi said it is very likely that fighting  within the coalition will emerge and political confusion  reappear in June, when the Hata administration has to hammer out  an agreement on the tax system reform centering around an  increase in consumption tax.    "If this (intro-coalition battle) happens... an early  general  election will seem necessary in order to let the people judge  over tax and foreign policy," the professor of political science  at Hokkaido University wrote in the mass-circulated ASAHI  SHIMBUN newspaper.    The Social Democratic Party (SDP), the coalition's largest  contingent, had first demanded the abolition of the current  three percent consumption tax and then insisted on the inclusion  of the need for "national consensus" in the platform as a  prerequisite for the hike. The coalition agreement, which was  reached after the party made a compromise, calls on the  coalition to carry out full- scale tax system reform "while  seeking people's understanding."    Shinseito co-leader Ichiro Ozawa, touted as the  behind-the-scene strategist for the coalition's agenda-setting,  has warned that the new cabinet may face future crises as the  policy platform does not adequately address upcoming problems.    Columnist Minoru Morita also voiced skepticism about Hata's  ability to tide over difficulties when political uncertainties  arise, although the "good man" who has few enemies has vowed to  strive for the unity of the coalition and "serve as glue for the  coalition."    "He is a very likable person indeed," Morita said. "But even  so, frankly, I still doubt that Mr. Hata is a person who can go  through a very tough, cold-blooded battle (to push through a tax  increase)."    The eight-month-old seven-party alliance is poised to split  into two camps -- one led by Shinseito and the other by the SDP.  The past two weeks has seen intense internal bickering over  policy following Hosokawa's bombshell resignation announcement  on April 8.    Coupled with the increasing polarization of the political  parties, some analysts have feared that the rifts over policy  revealed during the hard bargaining might make Hata's cabinet  short-lived.    Although the coalition finally managed to paper over  disputes  over the major issues, the all-night, on-and-off policy meetings  became a bitter reminder of immense difficulties awaiting the  new cabinet, they said.    "The coalition's framework has been maintained and the Hata  administration is going to be formed at the end of the  turbulence, but moves towards political realignment won't come  to an end," said political commentator Kotaro Akiyama.    Unlike hosokawa, who formed an administration last August  with a pledge to achieve political reform, Hata is not able to  find such a common and foremost goal to bind the coalition,  which had been on the brink of collapse during the past two  weeks, the commentator said.    "Therefore, the coalition parties will be soon flung into  political realignment and another political turmoil will  follow," he added.    The new party Sakigake (Harbinger), whose head Masayoshi  Takemura served in the key post of chief cabinet secretary in  the Hosokawa administration, left the governing alliance to  "cooperate from outside."    Public attention is now focused on when and how the rifts  over coalition composition within the coalition will widen again  -- a permanent division of the alliance that will eventually  change Japan's political structure.    "A power struggle structure has already surfaced to take the  place of the one featuring confrontation between the LDP and  non-LDP camp," Akiyama said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Croatian Foreign Minister Mate </F> Granic in Bonn by unidentified studio correspondent -- live]    [Text] [Correspondent] Good evening.    [Granic] Good evening.    [Correspondent] Minister, what is most interesting is the  17.5 percent [of the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina] that  Croatia is asking for the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna, and  here I can see some towns that would be included in the  territorial division of that republic.    [Granic] During the latest negotiations in Brussels, the  European Union accepted that the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna  should have 17.5 percent of the territory. Croatia today put  forward not only a contractual agreement on the settlement, a  cease-fire, and the overall regulation of Croat-Muslim relations  within the three-republic union, but also said that should the  union disintegrate, an alliance of states between the Bosnian  Muslim and the Croatian states will be created. As you can see,  this map is a Croatian proposal for the settlement. You can  also see that the Croatian side has made no concessions on Neum  and that a very important economic and ethnic part of the  Croat-populated area has been encompassed.    [Correspondent] Minister, please tell us whether  negotiations are continuing, or are we now waiting for something  to happen by 15 January.    [Granic] The Muslim side accepted this proposal with a great  deal of interest. Mr. Alija Izetbegovic himself said he will  support this proposal. What we discussed most was how to halt  all offensive actions, particularly those carried out by Bosnian  Muslim forces against central Bosnia. It should be also said  that no agreement has been reached regarding a settlement in  central Bosnia. Talks on Mostar are to continue in Medjugorje  on Thursday. Talks on the final economic access to the sea are  also continuing.    [Correspondent] Minister, please tell us the most  interesting thing: An urgent cease-fire for central Bosnia has  been agreed. How is this going to be done?    [Granic] In agreement with Mr. Akashi, Mr. Stoltenberg has  already organized a meeting between the military commanders,  Generals Roso and Delic. President Izetbegovic is to issue an  order to General Delic to halt all offensive actions. The Croat  side will strictly observe the cease-fire.    [Correspondent] Thank you very much, Minister.</p>

			<p><P> August 12, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SHELDON AND ART: THE MINISTER MAY HAVE GONE TOO FAR AFIELD  </P> <P> Re "Ministers Square Off Over Provocative Art Exhibit" (Aug. 3): Once again the  Rev. Lou Sheldon (I used the term ever so loosely) is raking muck and slinging  morally right mud where he sees it is needed most.  </P> <P> However, this time it's in a location outside of Orange County.  </P> <P> Well, isn't that special. Santa Monica won't stand for it and well they  shouldn't.  </P> <P> For Sheldon to want to limit the rights of Westside residents to view art or  limit the role of funding of any artist is just plain fascism at work, not to  mention throwing the First Amendment right out the window.  </P> <P> I just love it when ministers and all the rest of their ilk square off over  issues that nearly always restrict the rights and liberties of the general  public. It just serves to remind those of us aware individuals that true  concern for humanity comes with a mature respect for the differences.  </P> <P> ANTHONY RAMIREZ  </P> <P> Newport Beach  </P></p>

			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / People: Non-executive directors From this Friday, John Devaney, chief executive and managing director of Eastern Electricity, will join the board of Midland bank as a non-executive director. On the same day, Sir Colin Marshall, chairman of British Airways, will step down from the Midland board while remaining a non-executive member of the board of HSBC, which owns Midland. Three months later, Tony Hales, chief executive of Allied Lyons, will become a Midland non-executive, bringing the non-executive element of the 13-strong Midland board back to full strength. It has been one short since Charles Mackay, chief executive of Inchcape, stepped down a few months ago.</p>

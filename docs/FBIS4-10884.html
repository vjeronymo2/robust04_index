			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina; </F> place and date not given]    [Text] [NOTICIAS] What is your opinion as to why the  Paraguayan Government did not receive you officially?    [Robaina] I am not here on an official visit; I am visiting  Paraguay within the framework of a work schedule that I have for  several Latin American countries. Especially those countries  that are currently related to the activities of the Common  Market of the South (Mercosur). For me, the visit's nature is  not important, but the visit in itself is.    [NOTICIAS] What does the fact that Paraguay does not  maintain diplomatic relations with Cuba mean to you?    [Robaina] I did not come here to discuss whether there will  be diplomatic relations between Paraguay and Cuba. I did not  come here to discuss the Paraguayan Government's frame of mind  regarding relations with Cuba. That is not the purpose of my  visit.    [NOTICIAS] In which spheres can Cuba and Paraguay advance  jointly?    [Robaina] We want Paraguayan businessmen to learn about the  possibilities of investment that Cuba is opening up for all  countries. As brother peoples, the two countries need  integration.    [NOTICIAS] How do you manage in your country, taking into  account the fact that the economic blockade is still being  imposed?    [Robaina] We are suffering from the effects of an escalated  blockade. Cuba needs an economic model that includes opening  the country up to the world, thus occupying a privileged place  in the group of nations.    [NOTICIAS] What mechanisms is Cuba using to counter the  blockade?    [Robaina] To try and exist through resistance, and this can  be done because the people are technically and scientifically  prepared. We are enduring the blockade with what we have done in  the social sector, and we have the resources. Despite the  blockade, some countries have economic relations with us.    [NOTICIAS] Paraguay has voted in favor of the blockade  against your country.    [Robaina] I did not come here to discuss that. The people  have nothing to do with the vote of their representatives. The  blockade is harsh and one must think of the consequences of it.    [NOTICIAS] What are those consequences?    [Robaina] Despite the blockade that has been imposed by the  powers, we are convinced that in Cuba we are implementing a  model unique in the world, and that I believe is giving us  results because there is sufficient stability in the country and  good management of the entire system.    [NOTICIAS] Will you invite other groups to visit your  country?    [Robaina] We currently have exchanges between Cuban and  Paraguayan parliamentarians. Not so very long ago my country  received parliamentarians who were able to observe our reality.    We are looking into the real possibility of inviting other  Paraguayan delegations to Cuba so they can truly learn about its  social comportment in all its manifestations.    [NOTICIAS] What were the results of your dialogue with the  representatives of our Foreign Ministry?    [Robaina] The dialogue was extremely fruitful and very  useful because we walked the path that motivated our visit here.  I believe that the path that will lead us to really get to know  each other is a very important aspect for us.    [NOTICIAS] Are you happy with the treatment you received  from our diplomatic representatives?    [Robaina] There is nothing to make me feel unhappy, and  besides this is not the first country that I have visited that  does not have officially established diplomatic relations with  us.</p>

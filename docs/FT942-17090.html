			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Mexico defends currency Mexican interest rates rose sharply yesterday, as the government sought to stem an outflow of foreign capital which is threatening the stability of the exchange rate. Short-term rates on 28-day paper rose to 14.31 per cent, an increase of 2.7 percentage points on the day, and up from 8.81 per cent in late February. One year rates also rose to 13.66 per cent, a level not seen since last August. The stockmarket reacted badly to the interest rate rise, falling 1.4 per cent by mid-session, to 22,203. Mexico's economy was formally in recession in the second half of last year, and the government had been hoping for a rapid recovery before August's presidential elections. But the peso strengthened slightly, to 3.35 to the dollar yesterday morning, although it remained close to its permitted limit, and about 8 per cent weaker than at the beginning of the year. A devaluation of the peso outside the central bank's exchange rate band would come as a serious political blow to the government.</p>

A credit union's charter is the instrument granted to the institution by the state or federal government. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal credit unions receive their charters from NCUA and are subject to its supervision, examination, and regulation; they are incorporated under federal law. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State-chartered credit unions are incorporated in a particular state, receiving their charter from the state agency responsible for credit unions and subject to the state's regulator. If the state-chartered credit union's deposits are federally insured it will also fall under NCUA's jurisdiction. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A federal credit union's power and authority are derived from the Federal Credit Union Act and NCUA Rules and Regulations. State-chartered credit unions are governed by state law and regulation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are two types of charter conversions_federal charter to state charter, and state charter to federal charter.

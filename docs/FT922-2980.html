			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / Changing trams on the Maastricht road: Dominic Lawson is determined to decide his own role in history THERE WAS a young man who said 'damn] It appears to me now that I am Just a being which moves In predestinate grooves Not a bus, nor a train, but a tram.' I believe that the author of this limerick gave it the title Determinism. It is a profoundly depressing doctrine but one which has an attraction, particularly to first-year philosophy students. In many cases they go on to assert that since every cause has an effect it is possible to develop a story which will anticipate and predict the movement of this ineluctable tide in the affairs of men. This is sometimes called the march of history or, by the Marxists, historicism. In a way, it is a marvellously invigorating doctrine, like any faith. If you know that capitalism is doomed, that it will be succeeded by socialism and the dictatorship of the proletariat, and this in turn will be succeeded by the heavenly state of perfect communism, then you have the tremendous power of certainty and the confidence that only comes from knowing that you are on the winning side. That particular God has failed but there are others which have taken its place. Those who argue for a federal Europe, and ultimately a European super state, seem to me to have been similarly enthused and buoyed up by the idea that they are somehow being carried along by the tide of history, but the so-called 'Euro-sceptics' are in the same unfortunate position as King Canute. (And King Canute at least endured his drenching to prove to his courtiers that he was not omnipotent). Since most people lack the certainty of political faith, they are much swayed by those who have it. I had the impression, when socialism was the height of fashion, that even Conservatives felt that they were on the losing side of the history game and could only appease egalitarianism, not fight it. Similarly, even those Conservatives who had absolutely no faith in the European ideal, let alone Euro-federalism, seemed cowed by the conviction of the experts that this was indeed the march of history, that Jacques Delors had a clearer understanding of the future role of Britain in Europe than the woolly-minded Britons themselves. To say that the tide of history has turned, as a result of the Danish people's rejection of the Maastricht Treaty would be to make a similar mistake to that of the Euro-historicists. History itself has no independent tidal properties; there are only tides in men's opinions, which is nothing more or less than intellectual fashion. For intellectual fashion, we must await the judgment of the intellectuals, of the political avant garde. One such is George Walden, who caused a great stir in the House of Commons last week by telling his fellow Tory MP, John Major, that 'the Maastricht Treaty was never wanted by this Government, this House or this country.' As Simon Heffer pointed out in The Spectator, this was the same Tory MP who wrote last November in an article entitled 'Why in the end there is no choice at Maastricht' that: 'a policy of national conceit' had led some into thinking that Britain could refuse to sign the Maastricht Treaty and that those who did not want it were 'living in a world of their own fabrication, which resembles nothing so much as a mist-shrouded castle besieged by an army of Don Quixotes - they have taken leave of their senses'. There is need of a new political parlour game. Just as psephologists like to identify a constituency as so marginal that to know its result is to know the way the country will move, so it should be possible to identify a Tory MP whose intellect is so marginal, so uncertain and so finely balanced that as it swings, so swings the Conservative Party. Various names spring to mind but it would spoil the game to name all the candidates here and now. And besides, I have a tram to catch. Dominic Lawson is editor of The Spectator</p>

			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / Sport: Fall in a minor key - Baseball For this baseball fan, the season began with all the promise of a sunny April afternoon. On opening day at Yankee Stadium, the home team put on a display that signalled a year filled with tantalising possibilities. Four months later, my summer ended on an ambivalent note, far away from the top tier of the professional ranks, where play has been brought to a halt by a player strike. At Skylands Park, 65 miles west of New York city, the New Jersey Cardinals were showcasing the scrappy brand of baseball which attracted thousands of new fans to 'minor league' ballparks this year. This year was marked by a rebirth of sorts for the minor leagues, where small-town clubs such as New Jersey helped fill the void left by the strike for millions of disenfranchised fans. The walkout - which involves players on the 28 teams which comprise the American and National leagues - is in its fifth week. It has forced the cancellation of hundreds of games. With only 23 days left in the regular schedule, there is no agreement in sight. The cessation of play could not have come at a worse time. Even if a settlement is forthcoming, the strike has already spoiled a season in which some of baseball's hallowed individual records were threatened for the first time in decades. The strike proved to be a windfall for the 200 or so minor league teams which play in the relative obscurity of small cities and towns across the US and Canada. The main purpose of these 'farm' teams - most of which are independently owned - is to cultivate young talent for the major leagues. In exchange for an operating subsidy, each club fields players who can be moved around the parent club's organisation at any time. This year, the minor leagues carried their role to its logical conclusion. The strike forced television networks that feature baseball as their programming mainstay to turn in desperation to the farm system. ESPN, the 24-hour sports channel, twice called on the Birmingham Barons of the double-A (triple-A is the highest minor league level) Southern League to fill embarrassing holes in its schedule. Why the Barons? Its left-fielder happens to be a former professional basketballer by the name of Michael Jordan. Jordan's decision to try his hand at baseball this spring, brought a wave of welcome publicity to the minors, but he deserves only a small part of the credit for the farm system's season in the sun. After a long decline which began in the 1960s, minor-league teams have been enjoying a steady resurgence in popularity over the last few seasons. In 1993, total attendance at minor-league games reached 32m, up from 10m in the 1960s, when television introduced major-league action to the hinterlands. Today, new minor-league ball parks such as Skylands are springing up across the country, as local and state governments trip over one another to entice franchises to their areas. The reasons behind this resurgence are complex. In part, the farm teams have benefited from a disenchantment with big league baseball which has been bubbling just below the surface for years. The strike has further sullied the image of a sport in which the median player salary is Dollars 500,000 (Pounds 322,600) and billionaire owners are suspected of cooking their books to show operational losses. As a consequence, young farm hands - who earn Dollars 1,400 a month plus Dollars 18 a day in meal money - seem more like the idealised 'boys of summer' than their big-league counterparts. Most minor leaguers support the strike and, to a man, hope one day to make it to 'The Show'. But in the friendly confines of a small stadium like Skylands, it is easy to imagine the Cards are playing baseball for the sheer enjoyment of it. At least one very rich Baron is certainly doing just that. Economics has played a big role, too. Salaries are lower, and so are tickets and refreshments. Families of average means - most of whom now live in the suburbs - can enjoy professional baseball without the expense and inconvenience of travelling to the big city. At Skylands Park, the family event sphere seemed more like a county fairground than a big-league ball-yard. The good-natured crowd was equally divided between pre-teens - girls as well as boys - and their thirtysomething parents. Beer drinkers were thin on the ground. The atmosphere contrasted sharply with opening day at Yankee Stadium, where players on the field had to compete for attention with the numerous brawls which erupted in the grandstands.</p>

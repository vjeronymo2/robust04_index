			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / Letter: Not a policy of the ANC Sir, I refer to the generally interesting and instructive article 'De Klerk grasps a dangerous nettle' (August 28), which stated: 'They have been the target of the African National Congress, which called on its supporters to kill policemen and their families as part of its campaign to make South Africa ungovernable.' This is not the policy of the ANC. In view of the revelations by the various commissions of inquiry, the press, the churches and the sworn statements by numerous victims of South African police, and especially in recent times by members of the police force themselves, the African National Congress has acted with utmost restraint. We have consistently called for the police to be subject to law and to be charged and tried by the courts for the terrible actions perpetrated by them or with their connivance. R E Press, African National Congress, PO Box 38, 28 Penton Street, London N1 9PR</p>

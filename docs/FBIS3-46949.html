The agricultural working people throughout the country who  reaped rare bumper crops last year are now concentrating their  efforts on the production of compost, storage of water and  repair and readjustment of tractors and other farm machines in  order to have a bumper harvest again this year which will mark  the 30th anniversary of the publication of the socialist rural  theses (February 25, 1964.)    According to data available at the State Agricultural  Commission, the compost production nationwide reached 84 percent  of the plan as of January 5 and most of them has been carried  out to paddy and non-paddy fields.    The agricultural working people in North Hamgyong Province  and kaesong municipality have honored their compost production  assignments respectively at 105 and 102 percent.    Rural communities including those in North Hwanghae and  South  Pyongan Provinces and Nampo municipality have stored water  almost enough for this year's farming.    The repair and readjustment of tractors, rice-transplanting  machines, rice seedling-plucking machines and other farm  machines are near completion.    The adjustment of waterways and the check-up and repair of  water-pumping facilities have made a substantial progress.</p>

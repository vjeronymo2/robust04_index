			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Sport (World Cup'94): Mexico beat Ireland in Group E cauldron - Soccer Mexico's 2-1 win against Ireland yesterday means that four countries are locked in bitter struggle in the World Cup's toughest group. Luis Garcia scored both Mexican goals. But John Aldridge's headed goal for Ireland in the 83rd minute may prove important, reports Peter Berlin from Orlando, Florida. All four teams in Group E could still finish in any position. They are level on points (three) and on goal difference (zero). However, Aldridge's goal means Ireland at present share first place with Mexico: both have scored twice while Italy and Norway have scored once each. In the 44`C sauna of the Citrus Bowl, Ireland waxed and waned. When the sun hid behind cloud, they ventured forth; when it blazed, they slumped into defence. Manager Jack Charlton's latest trick to combat dehydration was plastic goldfish bags filled with water and tossed out to the players. But as the game wore on, the heat took its toll. Ray Houghton on Ireland's right wing was sluggish almost throughout. The most dangerous Irish threats came from the pacy runs of Terry Phelan. But Phelan was left leaden-footed in the 44th minute when a Mexican surge saw the ball laid into Garcia's path. His low 25-yard shot flew past Pat Bonner's right hand into the corner of the net. In the 65th minute, Mexico repeated the trick, Alberto Garcia Aspe skipping past Denis Irwin's indecisive challenge to set up Garcia, who drove to Bonner's right. Ireland were on the ropes. The normally unflappable Paul McGrath was left floundering by Mexico's pace. At the other end, the Irish seemed incapable of penetrating the Mexican penalty area. Charlton threw on two substitutes and with only seven minutes left, Ireland stole a precious goal. Jason McAteer escaped Joaquin Del Olmo and crossed for Aldridge to head down past Jorge Campos. 'Come on you boys in green,' sang the fans, even though it was Mexico who were clad in green.</p>

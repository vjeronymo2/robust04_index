For  determination of the coefficient of photoelectric linkage  K[.sup]c[/], current I[.sub][/] was measured by  illuminating the examined photodetector matrix. Next, the  photodetector was covered by a light-tight screen and its  current value was measured when the adjoining photodetector was  illuminated. The value of K[.sup]c[/] was determined from  equation K[.sup]c[/]=I[.sub]c[/]/I[.sub][/].  Spectral measurements were performed with a diffraction  monochromator MDR- 23. The results of this study indicate that  the diffusion length of the minor charge carriers is the  parameter of the material, which significantly affects the value  of K[.sup]c[/]. It was demonstrated that in the high  sensitivity spectral region, the curve of K[.sup]c[/] as a  function of the substrate thickness has a maximum, whose value  depends on the relationship between the absorption depth and the  radiation wavelength. It was established that the spectral  characteristic of the coefficient K[.sup]c[/] of the GaAs and  InP photo matrices is shifted to the shortwave spectral region,  compared to silicon.

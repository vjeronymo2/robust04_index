			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / Orders up sharply for civil engineers More civil engineers are reporting increases in orders than at any stage during the past four years, the Federation of Civil Engineering Contractors said yesterday. In a survey of more than 100 companies 45 per cent said orders had grown and 29 per cent said they had fallen. Companies were concerned, however, that spending cuts could mean the improvement would not last.</p>

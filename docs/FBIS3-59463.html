On 16 December hundreds of people were  arrested, locked up in the Pop Sapca Street jail and in the  cellar of the police, where they were subjected to brutal  treatment. On 17 December the avengers took up arms and shot  into the defenseless crowd. The wounded and the dead were  falling, and blood was pouring on Temesvar streets. Four years  after this tragedy, the names of the murderers are still  unknown. Ceausescu's executioners allied themselves with those  who shot at the demonstrators, and they succeeded in  discrediting and burying the idea of justice.    During the revolution, the Reprisal Commando was comprised  of  activists from the army, the Securitate [secret service], the  fire brigades, and the [Communist] Party. Only a few of them  were sentenced in the Temesvar trial and in some local trials.  For the bloodbath in Temesvar, the following persons were  prosecuted: Emil Macri, Ion Popescu, Traian Sima, Filip  Teodorescu, Gabriel Anastasiu, Ion Deheleanu, Petru Moraru, Ion  Baciu, Nicolae Chircoias, Gheorghe Atudoroaie, Ion Corpodeanu,  Tinu Radu, Iosif Veverca, Gheoghe Avram, Valentin Ciuca, Eugen  Misea, Laurentiu Preda, Tiberiu Grui, Viorel Bucur, Eugen  Peptan, Gheorghe Ganciu, and Iosif Emilian Zamfir. Beyond the 22  defendants, four party leaders were also prosecuted: Ion Coman,  Cornel Pacoste, Ilie Matei, and Radu Balan. Petru Moraru and  Emil Macri died in prison.    Almost two years after the trial began, the court handed  down  a sentence. Of the 26 defendants, only eight were sentenced: Ion  Coman to 25 years, Radu Balan to 23, Cornel Pacoste, Ion Popescu  and Traian Sima to 20 years each, Ion Deheleanu and Ion  Corpodeanu to 18 years each, and Iosif Veverca to 15 years. The  rest of them were acquitted for lack of evidence. Of those who  were sentenced, Traian Sima and Ion Deheleanu are still behind  bars; the rest were freed for reasons of illness.    Traian Sima, former Securitate commander in Temes county,  declared that he did not wish to be freed for health reasons,  "only through an amnesty or feet first" (dead). Ion Deheleanu's  daughter replied to our inquiry that we should look for him in  two or three months, by then he would be at home. The medical  certificates would soon be completed. Ion Corpodeanu is at home.  I visited him and talked with him through the window. He looks  good. He does not comment on the events of December 1989.  Although he is frequently seen in one of the stores of his son's  firm, he claims he did not become a businessman. He says he only  goes there to buy mineral water. Ion Coman, who was also  released for health reasons, moved and we could not find him.    Of the acquitted, Filip Teodorescu started writing cheap  mysteries, and he is making good money. Tinu Radu and Valentin  Ciuca became businessmen. They own the TIVAL IMPEX import-export  company together with an Arab entrepreneur. They export cement  and oil products for hard currency. Tinu Radu stated that they  were saving money dollar by dollar for a business venture. The  former police officer Viorel Bucur, whose role in currency and  gold dealings before 1989 was well known, was not sentenced.  During the reprisals he led generals Nuta and Mihalea to the hot  centers of the revolution. Today he is a successful businessman,  owner of the FARFALA and VIBASS companies.    Among the army officers who took part in the reprisals, the  names of Paul Vasile and Gheorghe Gheorghe are known. The former  was given the order to recapture from the demonstrators the  tanks stranded on Gyiroki Street. The command was: by any means.  Paul Vasile recaptured them. Very many people died and were  wounded on that occasion. Since then, Paul Vasile has been  promoted to the rank of colonel, and he is the chief of the  general staff of the Temesvar motorized regiment. Several people  stated that the squad which opened fire on the demonstrators was  under the command of Gheorghe Gheorghe. He was also promoted,  moved to a different army unit, and was awarded the title  "Veteran of the Revolution."</p>

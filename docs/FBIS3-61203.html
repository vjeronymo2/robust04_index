			<p>Language: <F P=105> Kazakh </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Environmental Conditions in Kazakhstan, Facts </F> From the Press Bulletin Issued in the Third Quarter"]    [Text]  <H5>  Condition of the Atmosphere </H5>   During this quarter it was observed that the atmosphere was  polluted in Leninogorsk City in particular. This was connected  with pollution by nonferrous metal industries and the occurrence  of climatic conditions unfavorable for the dispersal of the  city's air mass.    Dust: there was a great deal of dust in the air in Aqtaw  City  in particular. It was four times greater than permitted levels.  At the same time, the amount of airborne dust was three times  above permitted levels in the cities of Zyryan and Shymkent. In  comparison to the third quarter of last year, there was no  appreciable change during the third quarter of this year in  conditions in these cities other than the accumulation of a  great deal of dust in Aqtaw City. The administration of Aqtaw  City is devoting attention to these facts and will carry out  measures to prevent dust from spreading in the city.    Sulfur dioxide: This harmful substance is above permitted  levels in Leninogorsk City (2.5 times), Oskemen City (two times)  and Balqash City (1.5 times). By comparison with the third  quarter of last year, it has been observed that sulfur dioxide  has decreased in the air of Leninogorsk City. There have no  appreciable changes in the other cities.    Carbon dioxide: in as much as it has accumulated at moderate  levels, this harmful substance is not above permitted levels in  Kazakhstan cities. It is at permitted levels in Petropavlovsk,  Semey, and Oskemen cities where concentrations are greatest. By  comparison with the third quarter of last year, heavy  concentrations were observed in Semey City. There were no  changes in the other cities.    Nitrogen dioxide: in half of the cities tested, levels of  concentration were equal or less than permitted levels. The  areas where concentrations were greatest were Oskemen City (1.8  times above permitted levels), Almaty City, and Aktobe City  (both 1.5 times greater). By comparison with the third quarter  of 1992, the level of air pollution by nitrogen dioxide had  increased in Oskemen but decreased in Pavlodar. The other cities  remained unchanged.    Nitrogen oxide: Levels of this dangerous substance were  noted  in 10 Kazakh cities. On the average, levels of concentration  were not above permitted levels. It was most concentrated in  Oskemen City and levels there were about 70 percent of permitted  levels. By comparison with the third quarter of last year,  nitrogen oxide concentrations increased in Almaty, but decreased  in Zhambyl. Quantities in other cities remained unchanged.    Phenol: this harmful substances was also observed in 10  Kazakhstan cities. In Leninogorsk City it was four times above  permitted levels, and three times in Temirtaw. Average amounts  accumulating in Oskemen, Almaty, Zyryan, Qaraghandy,  Petropavlovsk, and Semey were one-two times above permitted  levels although concentrations in Pavlodar were at permitted  levels. By comparison with the third quarter of 1992, phenol  concentration levels had risen in Oskemen, Semey, and  Qaraghandy, but there were no appreciable changes in other  cities.    Formaldehyde: it was found in the air of nine cities. It was  determined that in Zhezqazghan, Leninogorsk, and Almaty  concentrations were six times above norms (permitted levels).  Concentrations in Qaraghandy, Aqtobe, Zyryan, Oskemen, and  Shymkent were four-five times above norms. In Petropavlovsk  concentrations were twice norms. By comparison to the third  quarter of last year, formaldehyde concentrations increased in  Almaty, Zhezqazghan, Qaraghandy, and Oskemen and decreased in  Zyryan and Leninogorsk.    Ammonia: this was observed in five cities. Shymkent was the  city with the highest concentration, 3.5 times above norms.  Aqtaw, Zhambyl, Qostanay, and Temirtaw were more or less at norm  levels. By comparison to the third quarter of 1992, ammonia  concentrations increased in Shymkent but decreased in Temirtaw.    Hydrogen floride: average concentrations of this substance  were two times above norms in Aqmola City. Concentrations were  at permitted levels in Zhambyl and Shymkent. By comparison to  the third quarter of 1992, concentrations were up in Aqmola  while concentrations were on the decline in Zhambyl.    Arsenic: concentrations in Leninogorsk and Oskemen equaled  norms.    Chlorine: chlorine concentrations were not above permitted  levels in Pavlodar, Oskemen, and Shymkent.    Pollution by airborne metals such as cadmium, nickel,  copper,  lead, and zinc was determined in 13 cities. In just Shymkent  alone, lead concentrations were 1.5 times above norms. By  comparison with the third quarter of last year, a decrease in  lead pollution was observed in Balqash and Leninogorsk.  Quantities of copper, nickel, cadmium and zinc in the air were  at public health levels in all cities.  <H5>  Water Pollution Levels </H5>   Research carried out by units of the Kazakh Bureau of  Climatic Research have shown that in the third quarter of the  year water was primarily polluted with nitrogen and nitrates,  oil products, metals (copper and zinc), and phenol. The quality  of water in the Zhayyq [Ural], Nura, Ile, and Qaratal basins had  improved compared to the same period last year. However, water  pollution had become worse in a few places. The Yelek river in  the vicinity of Algha City was polluted between the fourth and  the sixth class; that is, it was considered very polluted. The  flow of the Sherubay and Nura was polluted between the fourth to  the fifth class. It was observed that water quality in Lake  Balqash, in the Yertis Canyon, and in Toranghylyq strait of  Syrdariya had deteriorated considerably.    It was not observed in the third quarter that the waters of  the Zhayyq, the Syrdariya, Shu, Talas, Ile, Qaratal, Nura,  Sarysu, Tobyl, and Yesil river basins and Lake Balqash were  polluted above acceptable levels.    Facts regarding the pollution of water in the basin of the  Yertis River were not presented in the third quarter. Due to  fuel shortage, an analysis of its water chemistry was made at  the end of the month but there has been not time to analyze the  materials.  <H5>  Radioactivity </H5>   Radiation near natural sources in Kazakhstan was nine-15  microcuries per hour, and 20-60 microcuries per hour at places  where there were major layers on cliffs. Increased radiation was  observed in Kokshetaw Oblast. There are a number of natural  sources of Uranium there.    Contributing to the increase of radiation in Kazakhstan were  the effects of nuclear tests carried out in Kazakhstan, the  industrial activities, the Selebe and Chernobyl disasters, and  the Lobnur Testing Area in China. At the same time radiation was  connected with precipitation.    Since 1949 there were 510 nuclear explosions in Kazakhstan.  Some 470 were in the Semey Testing Area, eight at Kapustin Yar  (Ed.: according to other information it has been proved that  there were 11 tests at Kapustin Yar, that is in the Oral Area),  one in Aqtobe, 17 in Atyraw (at the Azghyr Testing Area), 17 in  Aqmola, seven in Western Kazakhstan Oblast (Ed.: one may add in  the above eight), three in Mangghystaw, three in Shymkent, one  in Qostanay. The combined power of these explosions, that is  radioactivity, was 12.9 million curies. Most of this was  concentrated in the center (epicenter) of the explosions. We are  currently researching the effects of this radioactivity on the  environment.    It is possible that the technical activities of various  industries spread radioactive pollution into the environment as  well. For example, judging from preliminary information, uranium  production and processing industries have accumulated 419  million tons (252,000 curies) of radioactive waste. There are  1.6 million tons (500 curies) in mining industries not producing  uranium. It is estimated that there are 11.4 thousand units  (32.6 thousand curies) in industries utilizing products produced  by the "Izotop" Production Union and 12.3 million tons (12000  thousand curies) of waste products at energy and experimental  reactors. Based upon preliminary data, the total amount of  radioactive waste is 233 million tons with a total radioactivity  of 13 million curies.    Leaving aside nuclear explosions on the surface and in the  air, highly radioactive substances producing 0.03-700 roentgens  per hour have been lost and have remained unknown. It is well  known that such sources were found in 1990 in Almaty and  Qzylorda. They were found in 1991 at Almaty and in Kokshetaw,  and in 1992 in Mangghystaw, at the "Ozenmunay" fence (not one  group but four). Similar radioactive materials have been stolen  from an oil plant in Atyraw Oblast. There has been observed  contamination from radioactive sources due to the disintegration  of storage containers at the Belogor Combine, at the Qaraghandy  Metallurgical Combine, at the Mangghystaw Expedition. The fact  that industrial radioactive substances used by oil producing  plants have been turned over to the people, and that we have  lost control over them, is extremely dangerous. Such pipes and  hoses have been used at the "Khimik" and "Qurylysshy" companies  in Mangghystaw Oblast, at the 58th Mobile Column of the Northern  Kazakhstan Oblast Water Administration, and by garden crop  producers in the area of Oskemen City. At the same time, it is  well known that radioactive equipment was used on 40 occasions  at the Zhanga Ozen fields, and on 21 occasions at the Zhetibay  fields. The Republic of Kazakhstan chief procurator is looking  into the fact that radioactive pipes were given to Taldyqorghan  Oblast in 1992.    Dear reader! If you read this, you must be careful about  receiving and using whatever you receive, from wherever it comes.  <H5>  Now What About Our Food and Drink? </H5>   State sanitary control organs in our republic have continued  to test specially certified products (i.e., products having  special permission) to prevent the spread of pesticides and  nitrates into the environment and likewise to prevent harm to  human health. Official services are carrying out an internal  control (veterinarial, in the markets, botanical protection and  planning-research stations in the fields).    Looking at some facts: contamination of food products with  pesticides during the third quarter of 1993 increased somewhat  (0.9 percent) over the same period last year. Pesticide residues  were above republic averages in Kokshetaw and Taldyqorghan  oblasts (respectively 5.4 and 4.6 percent). Pesticide residues  have increased in milk products. It is alarming that harmful  substances in milk products brought to factories in Almaty City  from Almaty Oblast have not decreased.    Pollution of plant agricultural products prepared as food  has  remained unchanged. The figure was 3.2 percent for the third  quarter of this year for the entire republic (compared to 3.1  percent for the third quarter last year). This indicator is  higher than the republic average in Northern Kazakhstan Oblast,  10.5 percent, in Qyzylorda, 9.4 percent, in Eastern Kazakhstan  Oblast, 8.2 percent, and in Aqtobe Oblast, 5.6 percent. Nitrates  were especially noticeable in Zhambyl, Aqtobe, Eastern  Kazakhstan, Northern Kazakhstan, Qaraghandy, and Kokshetaw  Oblasts.  <H5>  Some Measures To Protect the Environment </H5>   Harmful substances issued into the air are decreasing  primarily due to the decline of industrial production. On the  other hand, they are increasing in Zhezqazghan, Pavlodar, and  Almaty Oblasts. Since, during the nine months of the present  year, the "Balqashmys" Production Union and the  "Zhezqazghantustimetall" Corporation produced 83.2 thousand  tonnes of pollution above what was allowed, the chief state  inspector of the Republic made the decision to stop work at  "Balqashmys" from 1 July. Only since then have the interested  parties devoted attention to the problem of the processing of  sulfur anhydrides and halting the production of pollution above  norms. A fine of 3 billion rubles has been levied on the  industry and 1.8 billion rubles has been paid. A complaint has  been made to the government and to the Republic procurator's  office.    The Shymkent lead plant has violated laws on the protection  of the atmosphere. (As a result sulfur dioxide and sulfuric acid  vapor have increased excessively in the small Qazyghurt Rayon of  Shymkent City.) The responsible workers have been punished and a  fine has been imposed on them. The fact that the public raised  the alarm allowed measures to be taken against the "Silikat"  Corporation in Semey City. Since rubber was used to heat bitumen  in the residential rayons of Oskemen City (when roofs were being  tarred), the quality of the rayon worsened considerably. This  method was prohibited at the request of the oblast environmental  administration.    We note that in the process of testing measures were taken  to  reduce the issuing of harmful substances into the air at the  Pavlodar Reinforced Concrete Plant, at Almaty Healing Center No  1, at the Qaraghandy Metallurgical Combine, etc.    However, planned measures and the demands of inspectors were  not always carried out. Work was ordered stopped at the  Leninogor Polymetal Corporation on 21 September due to violation  of environmental laws but this order was not carried out. The  affair is now being prepared for prosecution by the procurator's  office.    Land is being ruined, polluted, and mineralized in our  republic. The Shalqar Agricultural Union in Aqmola Oblast has  dumped trash wherever it wants. The "Aqtobemunay" Union has  dumped residual fuel at drilling sites. The Qostanay  Administration for Mechanized Work has obtained soil without  permission; industrial wastes have been dumped on fertile land  in Bozvyshen Rayon of Northern Kazakhstan Oblast, etc., etc.  Fines have been levied as measures against violation of law.    Republic cities and urban settlements are still not  adequately equipped with plumbing. Reservoirs to collect  drainage water in Oral, Petropavlovsk, Qostanay, Zhambyl, and  Pavlodar (Bylqyldaq) are overfull. Measures have not been taken  by the Ministry of Energy and of the Fuel Industry to process  drainage water at Ekibastuz, and at the Leninogor Thermo-center.  For these and other deficiencies, the Qaraghandy No 1 Machinery  Factory, the Taldyqorghan Kazakh-German Union (hide processing)  Industry and others have been halted. Moreover, the case of the  chief engineer at the Aqtobe Chrome Fittings Factory has been  turned over to the procurator's office.    There has been no control exercised over the placement of  wastes in Zhezqazghan, Pavlodar, Qyzylorda, Kokshetaw, Semey,  and Eastern Kazakhstan Oblasts.    On 14 July, 1993, the Cabinet of Ministers issued a  resolution on "Development of State Resources and National Parks  in the Republic of Kazakhstan." According to this resolution,  funds are to be allotted to them and facilitations for workers  at natural reserves are foreseen.    The Ministry for the Environmental and Biological Resources  has drawn up a "Scheme for the Development and Disposition of  Republic of Kazakhstan Natural Reserve Resource Projects During  the Period Up Until the Year 2005" and the scheme has been  turned over to the Cabinet of Ministers.    Chiefs of oblast governments, in collaboration with the  Ministry of the Environment, have been given until 1 January,  1994 to produce other organizations out of reserves and national  parks.</p>

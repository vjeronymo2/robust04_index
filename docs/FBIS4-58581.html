			<p>BFN     [Text] Algiers, May. 03 (MAP) -- Prime Minister Mokdad Sifi  said his cabinet is contemplating `with much hope' the  establishment of a National Transition Council that will have a  legislative task during the transition period. In an interview  with Algerian news agency `APS' and daily 'AL-SHA'B', the  Algerian prime minister said the council is an essential body  with which the government will be in constant touch and to which  it is planning to submit its projected program to get out of the  current crisis in the country.    The National Transition Council which will be acting as a  parliament during the three-year transition period will be made  up of 280 members representing the state, political parties, and  nonpolitical organizations. The institution of the council is  to take place at the latest three months after the adoption of a  transition platform. Several parties, mainly the former single  party the National Liberation Front `FLN' and the Socialist  Forces Front `FFS' have declined to be represented in the  Council. Another group of some 30 political organizations said  they are ready to sit in the Council.    In the same interview, the head of the Algerian Government  said if conditions are met, elections which he described as  `unavoidable' will be held before the expiry of the transition  period. For the prime minister, the people have to choose those  who will decide their future and conditions for the consultation  have to be gathered. `We are ready from a technical and  administrative viewpoint to hold elections', he pointed out.    Meanwhile, Algerian daily `L'INDEPENDANT, which reappeared  on  the newstand after a two week-ban, reported Tuesday that the  curfew enforced in seven wilayas and extended later to three  other central regions will be lifted next June. The paper,  which quoted `reliable sources,' also cited measures to be taken  by the government to support the civil peace process in the  country. According to the daily, some leaders of the banned  Islamic Salvation Front, including Abassi Madani and Ali Belhadj  will be `shortly released'.</p>

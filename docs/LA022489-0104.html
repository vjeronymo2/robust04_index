			<p><P> February 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BIG LEAGUE PLAY;  </P> <P> A FINNISH FIRM'S PURCHASE OF WILSON INSTANTLY MAKES IT A CONTENDER IN THE  MARKET FOR SPORTING GOODS AND ENDORSEMENTS.  </P> <P> By buying Wilson Sporting Goods Co., a little-known Finnish company has won the  endorsements of some of the biggest names in sports -- a move that will make it  a top player in the global sporting goods market.  </P> <P> Amer Group Ltd.'s agreement this week to buy Chicago-based Wilson brings with  it names such as tennis star Chris Evert and golfers Nick Faldo of Britain,  U.S. veteran Sam Snead and Bernhard Langer of West Germany.  </P> <P> The diversified Finnish group already owned 80% of the MacGregor Golf Co.  golfing equipment maker, with the rest owned by U.S. golfer Jack Nicklaus.  </P> <P> "It's very important that big stars are using our products. For instance, in  golf there are something like 100 professionals with Wilson and it's the same  with MacGregor," said Heikki Salonen, Amer chairman and chief executive.  </P> <P> Amer said Monday it was buying Wilson for $200 million from Wesray Capital  Corp., a New York-based investment firm founded by former U.S. Treasury  Secretary William E. Simon.  </P> <P> Salonen said the purchase was the third biggest by a Finnish company.  </P> <P> Sports are only part of Amer's sprawling businesses. The company imports Toyota  and Suzuki cars from Japan and Citroen cars from France and also has a license  to produce Marlboro cigarettes.  </P> <P> Salonen said big names are the company's business, even if the Amer name  remained in the background. "It is not important that the parent company's name  is as well-known as the brand name, like MacGregor or Jack Nicklaus," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hope for Exposure  </P> <P> "Our basic philosophy is in the consumer brand-name business, but now we have  made such a big acquisition, the Amer group will become better known throughout  the world."  </P> <P> Amer, traded on the Helsinki and London stock exchanges and in American  Depositary Receipt form in the United States, had prior to the Wilson purchase  estimated its net sales in the financial year ending Feb. 28 at $1.1 billion,  with about 25% coming from overseas operations.  </P> <P> It said the acquisition of Wilson would boost sales to $1.76 billion, of which  sporting goods will account for 28% and overseas operations about 45%.  </P></p>

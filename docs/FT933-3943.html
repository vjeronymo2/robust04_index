			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / International Capital Markets: Austria's new issue market springs to life THE Austrian new issue market, long moribund because of deeply depressed share prices, has found a new lease of life in the past few weeks. Since late June, new primary and secondary equity issues raising more than Sch3.7bn (Dollars 325.15m) have been launched, almost as much as in the whole of last year. And there are many more in the pipeline. The main reason for this surge of activity is the sharp recovery of the Austrian stock market. Since a low point in January, the ATX index of 19 leading shares has jumped by some 40 per cent. More importantly, volume has increased substantially since June, when international institutional investors began to increase their weightings on the Austrian market. The biggest rights issues so far have been a Sch695m call in late June from Maculan, the construction group that has acquired a clutch of companies in eastern Germany, and a pair of issues worth a combined Sch1.9bn, which were announced by Brau Beteiligungs and its Brau Union subsidiary last month. The province of Burgenland has said it planned to float its 30 per cent stake in electricity and gas utility Burgenland Holding to raise an expected Sch300m. Leading food retailer Julius Meinl International announced a one-for-two rights issue to raise Sch188m. Analysts say the increased flow of cash calls reflects pent-up demand from the long period when the stock market was too weak to absorb new issues. 'Companies have not been able to raise new equity for two years,' said Karl Kaniak, a director of Bank Austria Investment Bank. Mr Marko Musulin, director of securities and investment banking at Creditanstalt-Bankverein, adds that many companies need new funds, either to take advantage of one-off opportunities to expand in central and eastern Europe or to promote new products developed in the past couple of years. 'The problem is that their profits are not in good shape because of the recession, so they have to recapitalise,' Mr Musulin says. A good example is Lenzing, the world leader in viscose fibre production. The group has crippled its balance sheet and its profits by investing in pollution control equipment in the past three years, and now needs new funds to promote a viscose fibre it has developed to compete with cotton. Meanwhile, the privatisation trend is still in the ascendant, as the government looks for ways to ease a budget deficit bloated by recession. In June, the troubled state owned Austrian Industries floated 74 per cent of Austria Mikro Systeme, a maker of specialised integrated circuits, raising Sch620m. Last month, the government said it would reduce its stake in partially privatised Flughafen Wien, the company that operates Vienna's airport, from 36.5 per cent to 25 per cent. Meanwhile, speculation continues that the government will soon sell off some of its controlling holding in Creditanstalt. The bank's shares have been among Austria's best performers this year. Austrian bankers expect the flow of new issues to continue well into next year, provided that the sell-off in the market this week does not lead to another slump.</p>

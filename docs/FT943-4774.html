			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Telspec shares slip 18p to 285p Shares in Telspec fell 18p to 285p yesterday in spite of the manufacturer of advanced telecommunications equipment announcing a 30 per cent increase in first-half pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.94m to Pounds 2.52m. Mr Garth Riley, chief executive, said the market may have reacted to a mention of a margin squeeze, and stressed that this referred only to a small proportion of the recently floated group's business. Manufacturing costs were being reduced, with the benefits expected by the year-end. The profits rise was struck on turnover 61 per cent ahead at Pounds 13.7m (Pounds 8.53m). The maiden interim is 1.2p, payable from earnings of 5.49p, a rise of 17 per cent.</p>

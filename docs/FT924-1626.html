			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: PM seeks to save stake in US airline MR JOHN MAJOR, the prime minister, will make a final effort to secure US government approval for British Airways to acquire a 44 per cent stake in USAir for Dollars 750m (Pounds 493.4m) during talks with President George Bush on Saturday. The proposed share stake agreement will expire on Christmas Eve. The deal, which would greatly further BA's ambitions to become a global carrier through the acquisition of stakes in other big international airlines, continues to be fiercely opposed by other large US carriers. Failure to complete its partnership with USAir, the sixth-largest US carrier, would be a serious setback to BA's international expansion strategy. The three biggest US carriers - American Airlines, United Airlines and Delta Air Lines - have asked their government to block the BA-USAir deal unless it can secure greater access for US airlines in the UK market, especially into London's Heathrow airport. Mr Major will throw his weight behind UK proposals tabled two months ago to liberalise the UK-US airline transport market to help win US government approval of the USAir deal. The UK three-stage liberalisation proposal so far rejected by the US involves: Immediate access from all US cities to all UK regional airports for US carriers if the BA-USAir deal is approved. The opening up of transatlantic routes to London airports other than Heathrow if the US simultaneously agrees to ease its rules on foreign ownership of US airlines. Foreign airlines are restricted to 25 per cent of the voting rights in a US carrier although they can acquire up to 49 per cent of the shares. Complete 'open skies' between the two countries including access to Heathrow once UK carriers can compete on equal terms with US airlines in the US domestic market. Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, confirmed this week that the UK's phased liberalisation proposal hinged on the proposed BA-USAir deal going through. Unless a last-minute breakthrough can be achieved, it now looks increasingly likely that the US administration will not clear the BA-USAir deal.</p>

			<p>921130 FT  30 NOV 92 / Risk and Reward: Growing concern over the dangers of counterparty credit THE importance attached to counterparty credit risk has increased substantially in recent years, due to declining confidence in the financial strength of banks and securities houses and a surge in the number of corporate defaults. Nowhere has the impact been more keenly felt than in the over-the-counter market in derivative instruments. In a securities trade, counterparty risk ends when the transaction is settled; in the derivatives market, it continues for the life of the agreement. In the burgeoning swaps market, which now totals Dollars 4,000bn, agreements typically run for three to 10 years. The result: an explosion of counterparty risk. Some regulators believe it is the greatest risk facing financial institutions, in a market where other risks are already substantial. Part of the problem is that counterparty risk in the derivatives market is difficult to quantify, since exposure changes as market prices rise and fall. Bankers have developed a number of techniques to reduce or limit counterparty risk. Some now ask for margin payments, imitating futures exchanges. In other cases, contracts require interim settlement, so that the period of risk is more limited. Or they may allow for mutual termination of agreements, if covenants are broken or credit ratings downgraded. One important means of reducing counterparty risk is still the subject of wrangling between bankers and regulators. Netting - which enables an institution to offset the value of profitable (in-the-money) and loss-making (out-of-the-money) transactions with a defaulting counterparty - remains something of a grey area. Currently, Basle capital guidelines do not allow netting for capital adequacy purposes. However, the Basle committee on banking supervision is to meet shortly to discuss the response to its consultative paper on netting issued in May. One reason for the reluctance to allow netting is the doubt about its legal enforceability in a number of jurisdictions. However, a report from the Bank for International Settlements in 1990 concluded that netting was likely to be enforceable in most major markets, and it has been implemented successfully in the liquidations of Drexel Burnham Lambert and DFC, the state-owned New Zealand development bank. Meanwhile, some of the banks and securities houses which were leaders in the derivatives markets have seen business fall away as their credit quality has deteriorated. According to a recent report by the BIS: 'At the long end of the market, counterparties pay more attention to credit standing than to the prices offered. This has resulted in a large share of the longer-dated swaps market being arranged by a relatively small number of highly rated institutions.' But weaker rated institutions have come up with an answer: a separately capitalised derivatives unit, structured so that it qualifies for a double-A or triple-A credit rating. Many are considering establishing credit-enhanced units in the coming year, based loosely on the model of Merrill Lynch Derivatives Products, established a year ago. Salomon Brothers is expected to set up a credit-enhanced vehicle in the next few months, while Continental, Citibank, Chase Manhattan, Lehman Brothers, and Kidder Peabody are also considering this route. (Goldman Sachs set up a separately-capitalised derivatives unit earlier this year, but with somewhat different objectives.) According to Mr Christian Schade, vice-president in charge of European swaps marketing at MLDP: '(Our derivatives business) has expanded across the board, because of the vehicle. We can deal with counterparties who would not normally consider us.' But a number of market participants say that such a structure is costly, using up excessive capital. By channelling resources into a relatively capital-intensive area, other areas of business may be held back. Nor are regulators convinced that 'ring-fencing' works. If rumours that a financial institution was facing difficulties swept the market, a separately capitalised unit would not necessarily be immune from a change in sentiment.</p>

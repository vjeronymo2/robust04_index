			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / People: Wilkinson joins Laird Group Geoffrey Wilkinson, a former British Steel executive who has been running his own business for the past 18 months, has joined The Laird Group, and will be appointed finance director in July. Wilkinson, 47, who is reluctant to discuss his experience at Prior Wilkinson, a partnership he set up in October 1991 together with David Prior, son of Lord Prior, describes Laird as 'a very good opportunity'. Wilkinson replaces Charles Barton, finance director for the past two years, who announced his resignation at the end of May. At the time, Laird chairman and chief executive John Gardiner explained that Barton had 'decided to develop his career outside Laird'. A graduate of the LSE and Stanford, Wilkinson first became acquainted with Laird when he worked for the Industrial Re-organisation Corporation 20 years ago. His next move was to British Steel. There, he became chief economist in 1978, later financial controller of an operating group, and then head of the corporate mergers, investments and divestments team. He and Prior then briefly worked for Garry Klesch of Quadrex Securities. Klesch put up the equity for a series of steel service sector buy-ins. Wilkinson moved again, this time to Dillon Reed, but he left when Barings bought into Dillon Reed and the London office was reorganised.</p>

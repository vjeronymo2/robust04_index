			<p><P> February 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD  </P> <P> Despite a last-minute offer by Marxist guerrillas to talk directly with the  government, El Salvador's army chief of staff as well as President Jose  Napoleon Duarte indicated that there is almost no chance that they would accept  a rebel peace plan to end nine years of civil war. The Farabundo Marti National  Liberation Front said it will send a high-ranking delegation to San Salvador to  discuss the plan. But Col. Rene Emilio Ponce, the nation's most powerful  military officer, said the plan is "aimed at creating chaos." Duarte also was  not optimistic, pointing out again that a key part of the plan, a postponement  of elections now set for March 19, is unconstitutional.  </P></p>

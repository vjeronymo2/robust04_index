			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Commerzbank improves 20% STRONG TRADING during the last two months of 1992 helped Commerzbank, the third-largest of Germany's big banks, to increase its total operating profits by 20 per cent last year to approximately DM2.2bn (Dollars 1.38bn). Partial operating profits - which exclude a contribution from the bank's own-account trading activity - increased by 15 per cent to approximately DM2.07bn from DM1.8bn in 1991, Mr Martin Kohlhaussen, the chief executive, revealed. Net interest income climbed by 10 per cent from DM4.2bn in 1991. The figures, ahead of brokers' expectations, are not normally available until March or April but have been released early to support the bank's long-expected rights issue, announced earlier this week. Commerzbank is raising DM500m via a 1-for-11 rights issue at DM200 a share. Mr Kohlhaussen gave no figures for net profits, calculated after provisions for bad and doubtful debts. However, he said that it would be inappropriate to raise the 1992 dividend from the DM10 a share paid in 1991 and that the priority would be to increase provisions. Provisions on former Soviet debt will be increased from the current level of 60 per cent to the level of other bank's provisions, likely to be about 80 per cent. The bank will be providing against its exposure to the Olympia &amp; York property group - which stands at DM530m - and Hafnia, the troubled Danish insurance company, where the exposure is DM300m. 'The result was so good last year that it allows us to make provisions so that we will no longer be affected by these cases this year,' Mr Kohlhaussen said. He said that the bank had only minimal exposure to Klockner-Werke, the steel company which last month filed for protection against creditors - and no exposure to any sizeable corporate problem cases in Germany. In spite of the worsening economy, Mr Kohlhaussen said he was confident about the current year's trading. He argued that it was not necessarily the case that the quality of loan business would deteriorate: there was evidence of high-quality companies borrowing from the bank again where in more prosperous times they could finance themselves through cash-flow. The rights issue was planned for last September but was postponed due to turbulent market conditions. The decision had been taken to raise the cash to remove uncertainty from the share price over the timing of the issue - and because of uncertainties facing the German stock market, Mr Kohlhaussen explained. He thought the positive impact of a cut in interest rates by the Bundesbank could be offset by poor corporate news and the worsening of the economy. Mr Kohlhaussen rejected suggestions that the bank was forced to hold the issue in order to comply with new capital adequacy rules which took effect at the beginning of the year. The bank complied with the rules fully as at end December and the extra cash would strengthen the bank.</p>

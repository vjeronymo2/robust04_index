			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Abuse of dominance is why fine was upheld Sir, The European Commission's record Ecu75m fine against Tetra Pak has been upheld (World Trade News: 'Tetra Pak loses appeal against fine', October 7). Your report states that Tetra Pak was regarded by the Commission as 'too dominant'. In fact, article 86 of the Treaty of Rome does not outlaw dominance. Market dominance often occurs because a company produces products consumers want. It is the abuse of that dominant position which can result in fines of up to 10 per cent of worldwide annual group turnover under the EU competition rules. Tetra Pak was found to have engaged in a range of practices such as discriminatory and predatory pricing, requiring purchasers of the company's machines to use only Tetra Pak manufactured cartons on the machines, excessively long leasing contracts and restrictions on re-sale of machines. As reported, the appeal centred on the definition of the relevant market, often the hardest issue in EU competition cases. It is unfortunate that the Commission is now considering, in a new technology transfer regulation, outlawing common provisions found in patent and know-how licences for companies with larger market shares; this will increase legal costs and add uncertainty to many licensing arrangements.

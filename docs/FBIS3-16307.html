			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 49; compiled </F> by Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy, edited by Vladimir  Shishlin]    [Text] President Leonid Kravchuk says that last Thursday's  decree by Crimean leader Yuriy Meshkov to hold a poll on  relations with Kiev "will not be legally binding regardless of  the balance of forces."    For his part, Crimean Parliamentary Chairman Nikolay Bagrov  defeated by Meshkov in presidential elections in January, in a  speech in Sevastopol said that on a number of points the new  president's first decrees were out of line both with Ukrainian  and Crimean legislation.  INTERFAX Note: Crimean deputies have not accepted Bagrov's  resignation as parliamentary leader that he tendered after a  crushing defeat in the presidential elections.    Bagrov said the Crimean president's decree sacking the  cabinet included a number of officials who were not cabinet  members, among them -- heads of the Ukrainian security services  for the territory and of "Crimea" TV company.    Bagrov said it was not sensible to try to make 1994 a year  of  continued elections, pointing to a parliamentary resolution  saying it was pointless to call local elections in Crimea on  June 26 timed to coincide with a similar vote in Ukraine.  Bagrov called for local elections to be held later in the year  instead of this summer at the height of a harvesting and holiday  season.    He praised the parliament's performance over the past four  years saying "Crimean statehood was the main achievement" over  the period.    However, Bagrov believes that on the negative side, the  parliament has failed to set in motion a mechanism for an "open  economy" in the territory.    But local observers think this is something that Russian  economist Yevgeniy Saburov, appointed as vice premier last  Friday, will be able to make progress in. Many point to the  fact that Saburov's first steps as virtual head of government  are clearly intended to ease tension in relations with Kiev.  INTERFAX Note: Shortly after his appointment, Saburov appealed  to the Ukrainian president to be granted Ukrainian citizenship.  And at a news conference later, he spoke of wanting "to nudge  Meshkov towards rapprochement with Kiev." Saburov said Crimea  would maintain very close ties with Ukraine. He praised the  professional skills of Ukrainian economics and finance ministers  Roman Shpek and Grigoriy Pyatachenko describing them as "highly  pragmatic."    At the same time, Saburov said the core of his cabinet would  be made up of leading economists, to be invited from Russia, and  whom he described as "highly competent professionals."</p>

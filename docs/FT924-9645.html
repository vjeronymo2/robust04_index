			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Explaura board moves as losses rise Explaura Holdings, the North American aggregates company quoted on the USM, reported increased pre-tax losses of Pounds 1.7m for the six months to June 30, against Pounds 1.35m. Turnover almost trebled from Pounds 409,000 to Pounds 1.1m. The results were struck after an exceptional provision of Pounds 780,000 against an outstanding debt. Explaura has applied to have the company involved wound up. Explaura also announced that Mr David Finch has returned to the chairmanship. Mr Rudolph Agnew has resigned because of the increasing likelihood of a conflict of interest between Explaura and Federated Aggregates. Mr David Singleton has resigned as managing director for the same reason. Mr Agnew and Mr Singleton are joint chairmen of Federated. Mr Finch said he was confident of greatly improved results in 1993 but difficulties with its previous contract would affect the second half of 1992. He added that the group continued to need short term liquidity which was being addressed by the board. Losses per share were unchanged at 1.15p.</p>

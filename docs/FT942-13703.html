			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / UK Company News: Reed Executive back in black Increased demand for office workers last year underpinned a return to profits at Reed Executive, Britain's largest employment agency. Shares in the company climbed 13p to 135p yesterday after the company reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 665,000 in the 53 weeks to January 2, compared with a Pounds 7.3m loss last time. Mr Alec Reed, chairman, said the improvement had been fuelled by a 33 per cent increase in recruitment of permanent white-collar staff, while demand for temporary staff rose by a quarter. At the operating level, the recovery transformed a Pounds 3.4m loss into a Pounds 1.19m profit, of which Pounds 842,000 was generated in the second half. Mr Reed said the figures were also buoyed by a sharp reduction in property write-downs at the group's 130 office locations. Surplus property costs - incurred mostly on office space above Reed's recruitment centres - led to exceptional charges of Pounds 524,000 last year, compared with Pounds 3.9m in 1992. Turnover, meanwhile, rose from Pounds 82.3m to Pounds 89.8m. Earnings per share came out at 0.2p, against losses of 11.2p, and shareholders will receive a 1p dividend - their first in three years. Mr Reed, whose family control 60 per cent of the company, also announced that his son James had been appointed operations director, with responsibility for 100 offices.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Neighboring Countries Are Increasingly </F> Concerned About an Economic Showdown Between Japan and the  United States"]    [Text] Following the rupture of the Japan-U.S. summit, it  seems that both countries are moving toward an economic  showdown. In this regard, Japan's neighboring countries --  including East Asian nations, Canada, and Australia -- are  increasingly worried about the situation. They are concerned  because their economic reliance on Japan and the United States  is high and they will be affected significantly should the  relations between two major economic superpowers fall into a  critical situation. Japan and the United States should remain  calm and consider the possible impact of their economic ties on  wide ranging areas in the Asia-Pacific region.    All of the neighboring countries are critical of the numeric  target, which the United States is demanding Japan accept. They  say that the establishment of such a target is linked to managed  trade. They are also very cautious about the possibility that it  may give a rise to bilateralism [nikokukan shugi]. Newspapers  in Hong Kong and Australia are also critical of the United  States. They say that "it was only recently that following the  conclusion of the Uruguay Round, the GATT member nations finally  confirmed to maintain multilateralism [takokukan shugi]."    They are not saying this to express sympathy toward Japan.  The newspapers are sharing the same view that "Japan can  certainly afford to open up its market and ease regulations a  little more." Their true feeling is that "it is not enough to  say no to the United States."    However, these countries feel uneasy about the hard-line  attitude of the United States toward Japan. East Asian nations  heavily rely on the U.S. market. Many of them have huge amount  of surplus trade with the United States. Therefore, the East  Asian nations feel that the United States may assume the same  hard-line attitude toward them. Of late, the U.S. Government,  by using the issues of human rights and working conditions as an  excuse, is trying to take a protectionist stand toward China and  Indonesia. However, the newspapers (including ASIAN WALL STREET  JOURNAL and FAR EASTERN ECONOMIC REVIEW) are strongly  criticizing this U.S. move.    Some people think that the Clinton administration's  hard-line  stand toward Japan is the same as "brinkmanship," a strategy the  United States assumed to deal with the Soviet Union during the  Cold War period. This is a strategy designed to force an  opponent to give in by assuming hard-line policies until the  last minute while knowing that there is a high risk (in this  case, an increase in anti-American sentiment in Japan).    It is said that President Clinton is aiming to strengthen  his  stand at home. He "began to take psychological retaliation  against Japan" to reverse the economic situation in which the  United States "has always been beaten by Japan," and thereby  ease American people's distorted feelings, (according to  WASHINGTON POST reporter Hoagland).    It was pointed out that such an attitude of the U.S.  administration toward Japan indicates that, in the long run, the  United States may take the same stand toward the entire East  Asia in the future, (according to INTERNATIONAL HERALD TRIBUNE  reporter Bowling).    Last fall, President Clinton hosted a summit, attended by  Asia- Pacific Economic Cooperation Minister Conference members  in Seattle. At that time, it was pointed out that mutual  relations between Japan, China, and the United States were  important to the Asia- Pacific region's stability and  prosperity. The United States expressed its intention to attach  importance to multilateralism.    However, the Asia-Pacific region's future will become gloomy  if Japan and the United States remain at loggerhead. We are  certain that the neighboring countries will suffer hardship as a  result of the dispute between Japan and the United States. Its  impact may be felt in the security area too. We must not let  the Japan-United States confrontation tear apart the  Asia-Pacific region.</p>

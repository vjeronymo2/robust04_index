			<p><P> July 16, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WILLIAMS DOMINATES DIVING, WINS 10-METER CHAMPIONSHIP  </P> <P> Wendy Lian Williams' last visit to the U.S. Olympic Festival was not pleasant.  This one should help erase the memories.  </P> <P> Williams, the bronze medalist at the 1988 Olympics, dominated the competition  Sunday on the last day of the Festival in winning the 10-meter platform  championship.  </P> <P> In her only other festival appearance, in 1985, she had finished seventh.  </P> <P> "It was disastrous," said Williams of Laguna Beach. "That was so long ago. I  feel like a different person now. In those days I felt so young and naive and  scared up there."  </P> <P> Although she didn't do as well on her final dive as she had wanted, the  23-year-old piled up 443.16 points to beat Mary Ellen Clark of Newton Square,  Pa., by nearly 50 points.  </P></p>

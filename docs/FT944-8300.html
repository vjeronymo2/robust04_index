			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / People (Names in the News): Abdellatif takes over from Saudi at ABC When Ahmed Abdellatif, managing director of Riyad Bank, Saudi Arabia's second largest, takes the helm of Arab Banking Corporation next year, bankers expect a period of consolidation rather than revolution from the former deputy governor of Sama, the Saudi central bank, writes Mark Nicholson. Abdellatif, 59, who will become ABC's chief executive once Riyad Bank has replaced him, is a very different figure from Abdullah Saudi, ABC's founder. Saudi, who quit last month after 14 years in charge, is credited with turning the Bahrain-based offshore banking unit into one of the biggest banks in the Middle East with offshoots in Europe and Asia. But Saudi, despite his name, is a former Libyan central banker, and it is widely felt that his nationality was the primary reason for his resignation. Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, who with Libya are the chief shareholders in the bank, were concerned that Saudi's Libyan connections might lead the US to freeze the bank's assets. Abdellatif, by contrast, is a friendly, sure-footed Saudi who was plucked out of his country's central bank to revive the fortunes of Riyad Bank, an underperforming giant which had never made the most of its influential shareholders and solid capital base. He is credited with doing a good job but as an ex-central banker he is not expected to match Saudi's entrepreneurial management style. Another sign of the increasing Saudi Arabian influence is the appointment of Sheikh Khalid Ali Alturki, who has taken over from Saudi as chairman of ABC International Bank, the group's London- based subsidiary. Sheikh Khaled, a leading businessman in Saudi Arabia's Eastern Province, has been a director of ABC since 1992 and was founder director of Saudi American Bank, the Riyadh-based joint venture bank of which Citibank is a leading shareholder. Some Western observers had expected Stanislas Yassukovich, the deputy chairman, to replace Saudi.</p>

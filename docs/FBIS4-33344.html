			<p>BFN     [Text] PT [Workers Party] presidential candidate Luiz  Inacio Lula da Silva yesterday denied any links between his  party and the Landless People's Movement (MST). "I don't  believe in that," Lula said while on a Brasilia-Sao Paulo  flight, on his way back from a Citizens' Caravan tour of  Brasilia satellite towns. "I have no information on the PT  being engaged in organizing the movement."    "People have no land because they have no government," he  said. Lula emphasized he knows people in the landless movement,  and knows they like to be independent. "They are even  sectarian," he noted, adding he does not believe they would  tolerate anyone's leadership.    Sole Workers Center (CUT) President Vicente Paulo da Silva,  aka Vicentinho, yesterday labelled "terrorist" a Strategic  Affairs Secretariat (SAE) report on the MST. "To me it's an  anti-Lula report," he said. "I do not believe a bit of what it  says, and I will go to the places where the intelligence service  has spotted guerrilla bases to prove that this is not true," he  added.  <H5>  Solidarity </H5>   According to Vicentinho, the MST and the CUT are "on good  terms." "We feel solidarity for the movement, but the MST is an  independent organization," he added. "The Metalworkers' Union  of the Sao Paulo industrial belt has already helped the MST  camps by sending them food, but the communities of the areas  near the occupied zones have also provided them food and  medicines."    Vicentinho believes the MST has no armed structure. "I  believe they are even pacifist," he said, "because they are just  fighting for a piece of land and for the right to live."  Vicentinho also denied charges of MST radicalism. "Saying that  the MST is a leftist movement is very different from saying what  the SAE report said."  <H5>  Doubts </H5>   Acting National Confederation of Farmworkers (Contag)  President Aloisio Carneiro also cast doubts on the report. "The  MST is an independent organization and has nothing to do with  Contag," he said, adding that "all the same I do not believe in  the SAE report." Carneiro said that MST and Contag are also on  good terms. "Like the MST, our congresses chose occupation as a  method for action," he said. "It is a form of pressuring the  government to implement land reform."</p>

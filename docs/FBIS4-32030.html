			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Doru Dragomir] </F>   [Text] On 13-16 June the major territorial commands of the  Ministry of National Defense will organize the second stage of  testing personnel in these military units. On the basis of  certain regulations of the Defense Ministry, the personnel in  the military commands will have to take a number of exams.  These exams are organized directly by the General Staff and are  part of the process of transforming and restructuring the Army.    In accordance with the importance, area, and size of the  commands, it is possible that the number of personnel will be  cut by a maximum of 15 percent. The first stage of testing  personnel took place in the second half of May at a local level.  At the level of the entire ministry, a maximum 20-percent cut  in personnel is envisaged in territorial and central structures.  The most important territorial commands of the Ministry of  National Defense are in Bucharest, Bacau, Cluj, and Drobeta  Turnu Severin.</p>

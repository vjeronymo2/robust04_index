			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / Metals group wins backing for rescue: David Waller recounts how Metallgesellschaft was brought back from the brink of collapse Metallgesellschaft, the German metals, mining and industrial group, staved off the threat of bankruptcy this weekend after winning agreement to a revised DM3.4bn (Pounds 1.3bn) rescue package. At a 10-hour meeting on Saturday, representatives of 120 creditor banks buried their opposition to initial rescue proposals and approved new plans, averting what would have been Germany's biggest corporate collapse since the AEG electrical group went bankrupt in 1982. The talks took place behind closed doors at the Frankfurter Hof hotel in Frankfurt. Shortly before 9pm Mr Kajo Neukirchen, the restructuring expert appointed chief executive last month, emerged to tell a scrummage of reporters that the company had been rescued. Appearing alongside him was Mr Carl Boehm-Bezing, the Deutsche Bank director who chaired the talks. Mr Boehm-Bezing explained that the terms of the deal had been modified to take account of 'understandable' criticism from foreign banks. Without giving many details, he said that German banks had increased their commitment to compensate for foreign banks' reluctance to go along with parts of the package. Deutsche and Dresdner banks, which each own more than 10 per cent of MG's shares and count among its biggest creditors, would provide nearly half the DM700m of fresh loans to the stricken conglomerate. This reverses the pair's previous position that they would lend no more money on top of the emergency DM1.5bn which they supplied last month. Mr Neukirchen declared that it was his mission to restore the group's tarnished reputation. Metallgesellschaft, founded in 1881 by an Englishman, has a turnover of DM27bn, 258 subsidiaries and 58,000 employees. With the talks concluded but for a few formalities, Mr Neukirchen said it was time to concentrate on restructuring the group. He was planning to sell the Kolbenschmidt car components company, as well as a trading operation in the Netherlands and some mining activities. About 10,000 employees were likely to lose their jobs with the aim of saving DM700m a year. Saturday's talks were convened after both domestic and foreign banks refused to back the original proposals by last Wednesday's deadline. The deal envisages a DM1.4bn rights issue, the conversion of DM1.3bn of bank debt into junior convertible stock and the provision of DM700m fresh credit. The broad outlines of this package are the same as originally proposed, but the details have been modified in favour of foreign banks.</p>

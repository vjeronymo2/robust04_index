			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chinese traders face heavy copper losses SOME CHINESE trading houses are suffering substantial losses because of the recent collapse in London Metal Exchange copper prices, according to traders and analysts. Nobody knows the details, but trade estimates yesterday suggested Chinese losses might be as much as Dollars 80m. LME sources suggest there was a concerted attack by some London traders on the Chinese futures and options positions. This helped to drive down copper prices from a 1993 peak of Dollars 2,400 a tonne to a 5 1/2 -year low of Dollars 1,820 a tonne yesterday. 'The London traders have been going after the Chinese for six to eight weeks. They found their long positions and hit them hard,' said one observer. This was a reversal of the situation in 1992 when the Chinese seemed to be all-powerful in the copper market. China's demand for the metal is so great that its traders are estimated to have bought 300,000 tonnes of physical metal last year and taken futures positions on 500,000 tonnes. Analysts say the Chinese used their buying power and astute trading ability to make handsome profits in 1992. However, traders suggest the Chinese left themselves somewhat vulnerable by buying about 85,000 tonnes of physical copper in December, which was enough to cover most of China's first-quarter 1993 import requirements. The London traders' determined attack pushed the copper price down below Dollars 2,100 a tonne, a level at which Chinese 'sell stops' (sales to keep losses to a pre-determined minimum) started to be triggered. Chinese losses on some contracts are between Dollars 200 and Dollars 400 a tonne, traders estimate, but it is impossible to guess the tonnage involved. 'It could be between 100,000 and 200,000 tonnes. But they can handle the losses,' said one. Traders say that, while the Chinese 'lit the blue touch paper', for copper's fall, much of this week's volatility and further price drop has been caused by options traders being forced to offload positions into a very thin market. 'Most of the traders with real business to do have stepped aside because of the extreme volatility. The big option books are now being crucified,' said one. Analysts expect the copper price to stabilise now. Mr Wiktor Bielski, analyst at Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken, part of the Banque Indosuez Group, said copper was unlikely to fall below 75 cents a lb (Dollars 1,653 a tonne) and would probably form a base at 80 cents, a price at which one quarter to one third of world producers broke even. The price rally when it came would be as sharp as the recent fall as 'buy stops' would be triggered on the way up. He pointed out the copper market remained fundamentally weak, with a supply surplus of at least 200,000 tonnes expected this year and a period of seasonally poor demand in the northern hemisphere fast approaching.</p>

			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Power pool deal may save Pounds 30m The electricity industry hopes to save more than Pounds 30m a year for consumers as a result of a deal yesterday between National Grid, operator of the transmission system, and electricity suppliers. The agreement is aimed at reducing 'uplift' costs associated with the running of the electricity pool, the wholesale market through which all power is traded. National Grid is to be given more incentives to find economic solutions to a variety of problems tied to transmission infrastructure, circuit breaks, and the need to call on expensive plant to ensure supply meets demand. Uplift costs have risen sharply since the pool was set up in 1990, from Pounds 260m in 1990-91 to an estimated Pounds 580m last year. PowerGen, the generating company, estimates that the overall cost of uplift in 1994-95 will show a reduction of about 5 per cent on 1993-94 as a result of yesterday's deal. Other industry estimates put the figure higher. Some said that up to Pounds 80m could be saved if National Grid were to maximise the earnings available to it under the deal. National Grid said yesterday that it was confident it could drive costs down. Under the arrangements it has agreed a target for uplift costs of Pounds 570m in 1994-95. It will receive 30 per cent of any savings below this threshold to a cap of Pounds 25m. It will be responsible for 20 per cent of excess costs over a figure of Pounds 587m although losses will be restricted to Pounds 15m. PowerGen said high levels of uplift in the first half of 1993-94 adversely affected its margins. The incentives to control and reduce uplift would benefit the company and its customers. National Power, the other large generator, said it did not expect the scheme to have any significant impact on its prospective profits in 1994-95.</p>

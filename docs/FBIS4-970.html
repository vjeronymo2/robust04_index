			<p>BFN     [Text] Lagos, April 19 (AFP) -- Seventy-four persons  appeared in court in connection with demonstrations in the  central town of Jos in which five persons reportedly died and  many were injured, the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reported  Tuesday [19 April]. The suspects were charged Monday in a Jos  magistrate's court with unlawful assembly, rioting, causing  mischief with fire and possessing arms, NAN said.    The demonstration last Tuesday in Jos, capital of the  central  Plateau state, was over the controversial appointment of a  Moslem as the head of a local government council in  mainly-Christian Jos. The Christian population expressed its  opposition to the appointment, a step which made the government  suspend the move, but this triggered off the protest by the  Moslem population.    The demonstrators set ablaze the main market in the city,  two  mosques and a church and some cars, eyewitnesses said.    The state military administrator, Colonel Mohammed Mana,  swiftly imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew on the city and nearby  Bukuru town, and deployed soldiers on the main roads to restore  order.    The government later relaxed the curfew, according to NAN.</p>

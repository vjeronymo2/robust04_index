			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / The Week in Luxembourg: Investigations of dumping must not ignore issues of competition - European Court The European Community institutions must take into account EEC competition rules when determining issues relating to the damage caused to EC industry by dumped imports, the ECJ ruled last week. The Court said failure to take competition rules into account would lead to the annulment of EC regulations imposing anti-dumping duties. The case involved the validity of the EC Council regulation imposing definitive anti-dumping duties on imports of calcium metal from China and the former Soviet Union. Extramet, a French company and the EC's largest importer of calcium metal, claimed that the Community institutions had failed to determine correctly the cause of any injury which may have been suffered by the Community industry. Extramet alleged in proceedings before the European Commission and the EC Council that the Community industry had refused to supply calcium metal and that this was the true cause of any injury, not imports from China and the Soviet Union. The French company, Pechiney, is the sole producer of calcium metal in the EC. Extrament had also made a complaint to the French competition authorities alleging an abuse of a dominant position by Pechiney. The ECJ ruled that in assessing the damage suffered, the Council and the Commission must take into account only the injury caused by the relevant dumped imports. Other factors, including injury caused by the Community industry itself, must not be attributed to the dumped imports. As the Council and Commission had not shown that they had taken the alleged anti-competitive behaviour of the Community industry into account when determining damage the regulation was annulled. This is the first time that the ECJ has expressly ruled that the outcome of anti-dumping proceedings may be affected by the anti-competitive conduct of the industry which the EC seeks to protect. Although the decision is limited in scope, it will be welcomed by international business which is subject to different policy considerations under the EC competition and anti-dumping rules. Extrament also challenged the anti-dumping duties on other grounds which the Court did not consider in the interests of judicial economy. In particular, the court did not discuss Extramet's argument in the context of the Community interest that anti-dumping duties should not be imposed if their effect was to help maintain an unfair advantage in the market resulting from anti-competitive behaviour. However, when Advocate General Jacobs delivered his opinion in the case back in April he stated that competition law issues should be considered by the Community institutions before deciding that the imposition of duties would be in the public interest of the Community. Case C-358/89, Extramet Industrie SA v Council, 6CH 11 June 1992. Spanish restrictions on bulk Rioja exports overruled In a rare ruling on internal market export restrictions the European Court of Justice last week condemned Spanish rules limiting bulk Rioja exports to other EC countries. The case involved bulk exports of Rioja from Spain to Belgium. A Belgian supermarket ordered 3,000 hectolitres of Rioja from a Spanish company. When told it could only have 600 hectolitres because of Spanish export controls it brought proceedings in a Brussels court to enforce the contract. A 1988 Spanish law regulating the registered designation of origin of wine requires wine producers to bottle all wines where they are produced, except for exports, until 1993. In 1988, however, Spanish authorities imposed quotas on bulk Rioja exports. The ECJ said the export rules contravened EEC rules on free movement of goods. They discriminated against exports because the bulk quotas only applied to export sales and not domestic sales. The Spanish government failed to convince the Court that the quotas were necessary for the protection of intellectual and commercial property. The Court ruled that export restrictions could only be justified where they were necessary to ensure that the origin marking fulfilled its specific function - to guarantee the wine's provenance and characteristics. Case C-47/90: Etablissements Delhaize Freres and Compagnie Le Lion SA v Promalvin SA and AGE Bodegas Unidas SA, FC 9 June 1992. Taxes on non-Community banana imports lawful The ECJ also upheld last week an Italian consumption tax on bananas imported from outside the EC. The law imposing the tax was however repealed shortly after the case began. The Italian law imposed a consumption tax on all bananas irrespective of their origin. In 1987, the ECJ condemned the tax in respect of bananas in free circulation within the EC under internal market tax rules. On this occasion the court held that the tax was lawful provided it did not apply to bananas in free circulation. However, the court made it clear that certain provisions of international treaties between the EC and developing countries, such the ACP Convention, should be examined by the national courts to determine the legality of such a tax. Joined cases C-228/90 to 234/90, C-339/90 and C-353/90: Simba SpA, Comafrica SpA, Camar Srl, Co-Frutta SpA and Chiquita Italia v Italian Ministry of Finance, FC 9 June 1992. Other cases The ECJ held that French storage charges on cereals were in breach of the EC cereals market organisation and the Rome Treaty provisions on customs duties and state aids. The French storage charges discriminated in favour of domestic production. Joined cases C-149/91 and 150/91: Sanders Adour SNC et Guyomarc'h Orthez Nutrition Animale SA v Director of Tax Services for Pyrenees-Atlantique, 6CH 11 June 1992. The Court also held that Spanish rules limiting VAT refunds to claims based on a special form of invoice breached the Sixth VAT Directive provisions because no refund was available to claims based on an ordinary invoice. Case C-96/91: Commission v Spain, FC 9 June 1992 The Court of First Instance has rejected an application to declare invalid a Commission decision fining Finsider, the Italian steel producer, for exceeding its quotas of steel production. Case T-26/90: Societa Finanziara Siderurgica Finsider SpA v Commission, 1CH 5 June 1992. BRICK COURT CHAMBERS, BRUSSELS</p>

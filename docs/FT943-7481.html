			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / Observer: Jubilado luminoso What is it about being president of Peru that attracts the most unusual candidates? Last time round, in 1990, there was the spectacle of an agricultural college professor - Alberto Fujimori - slugging it out against a novelist - Mario Vargas Llosa. Now Javier Perez de Cuellar, former secretary-general of the United Nations, has tossed his bonnet in the ring for the 1995 rematch, when El Chinito - as Fujimori is affectionately if inaccurately known - is likely to stand again. His wife, Susana Higuchi, also wants to run. First she has to overrule a recently passed law preventing presidential spouses from competing. At 74, you might think de Cuellar would prefer his retirement in Paris, where he can enjoy his favourite Schubert piano sonatas in tranquillity. But no: 'Peru is lost if nothing is done. I believe I have a duty,' said de Cuellar recently. What can he mean? Fujimori has presided over a magical economic turnround; 11.8 per cent growth so far this year, making Peru Latin America's most dynamic economy. Inflation has collapsed from 1990's peak of 7,500 per cent to a probable 20 per cent this year. Perhaps he's thinking of Fujimori's less sparkling record when it comes to keeping military hard men in their place. De Cuellar knows all about that from his success first in keeping the Argentine junta out of the Falklands in 1982, and then in persuading Saddam Hussein to pack up and walk out of Kuwait in 1991. Still, de Cuellar, who counts among his many honours a 1987 honorary D Ll from the Mongolian state university, can be forgiven for sounding out of touch; he's spent most of the past five decades anywhere but Peru.</p>

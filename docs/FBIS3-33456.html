Lage, who is responsible for the Cuban economy, visited  Chile  last year. President-elect Eduardo Frei then invited him -- as  well as singer Silvio Rodriguez -- to attend the inauguration,  EL MERCURIO reported today.    Deputy Gutemberg Martinez reported on 21 February that,  within the framework of the visits exchange program, the  Christian Democratic Party [PDC] -- which is the Chilean ruling  party -- will send an official delegation to Cuba and that he  will head the delegation.    The deputy added that the trip probably will take place in  March, and United Labor Confederation [CUT] President Manuel  Bustos and PDC ideologist Jaime Castillo Velasco also will be  members of the delegation. The CUT is the main Chilean labor  union.    Deputy Martinez explained that the trip's objective is to  check on the enforcement of human rights in Cuba and on whether  a democratic transition process is really under way in the  country.    The administration to be headed by Frei is analyzing the  possibilities of resuming diplomatic relations with Cuba.    Since 19 July 1991, Chile and Cuba have had diplomatic  relations only at the level of consulates.    Some Chilean entrepreneurs already are doing businesses in  Cuba. Carlos Cardoen, for example, has hotels and agricultural  products companies in Cuba.</p>

			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Further ground lost in nervous trade UK EQUITIES continued to give ground yesterday as European foreign exchange dealers struggled to respond to the latest developments in Scandinavian currencies. The sudden increase in Sweden's marginal lending rates to 75 per cent alarmed London and share prices fell sharply in early trading. By the close, however, the London market had rallied very cautiously behind sterling to record a net fall of a further 10.2 on the FT-SE scale. Once again trading volume was poor and marketmakers were left to move prices around quickly, often in response to company trading reports which sounded an uncertain note. English China Clays, the industrial materials group, shook the sector with news of a heavy drop in profits. However, there was a maintained dividend at P &amp; O and a good performance from Prudential, the insurance company. Equities rallied from an early loss of nearly 15 on the Footsie and were approaching overnight levels until London money market rates moved higher. The market swiftly went into reverse again and was 16.1 down at 2,321.6 until a steadier trend in the pound helped equities stage a second recovery. The UK stock market closed before reports - later denied - that a Bundesbank official had suggested that sterling devaluation was inevitable received publicity on the Seaq trading screens. The final reading showed the FT-SE Index at 2,327.5, for a decline on the day of 10.2 points. While a 10-point loss on the Footsie is no great news in markets at present, yesterday's fall reflected continued nervousness among investors. Seaq volume increased towards the close when marketmakers moved to pick up stock to meet selling commitments taken on earlier in the week. The final Seaq total of 400.8m shares compared with 418.2m on the previous day, but Tuesday's figure represented a mere Pounds 682.2m in terms of retail, or customer, business. The big institutions continued to keep away from the London equity market, watching nervously as the developments in Scandinavian currencies implied fresh pressures on sterling and thus on the UK government's commitment to the ERM network. There was no immediate response, however, to a call from a leading member of the UK Labour opposition party for Britain to drop the pound's link with the D-Mark and to press for sterling devaluation. The renewed worries over sterling and the implications for UK interest rates fell heavily across the building and retail consumer sectors. With ECC's poor figures adding to the pessimism, there were substantial falls in Redland and other stocks in the building materials area. The London Stock Exchange announced yesterday that, following the quarterly review of components of the FT-SE 100 Share Index, TI Investments, Scottish Hydro-Electric, Southern Electric, Burmah Castrol, De La Rue and Kwik-Save will join the index, and Willis Corroon, Pilkington, Royal Insurance, Hillsdown Holdings, British Aerospace and RMC will leave the index list.</p>

			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Package setback for Euro Disney EURO Disney, the troubled leisure group, yesterday faced a fresh blow when BA Holidays, the package tour subsidiary of British Airways, announced that it was abandoning sales of holidays to the struggling EuroDisneyland theme park. BA Holidays said it was cancelling its holiday sales to EuroDisneyland because the British tended to prefer to travel to the park by road or rail, rather than air. It has only sold 1,000 of the 5,000 hotel rooms allocated to it this year at the Euro Disney resort and expressed concern that demand for air packages was likely to fall further when the Eurotunnel rail link opens. Euro Disney yesterday played down the significance of BA Holidays' withdrawal claiming that it was 'never a major player in our tour operation business from the UK'.</p>

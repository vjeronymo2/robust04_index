The representatives of these countries issued a press  statement in which they allowed themselves to interfere in  Iraq's internal affairs. They have also launched lies and  allegations, full of fallacies, about Iraq's domestic situation,  in an attempt to distort facts that are no longer a secret to  world public opinion.    We strongly condemn this blatant interference in Iraq's  domestic affairs by the parties that met in Ankara. The  deteriorating situation and the spread of crime and looting and  killing in the governorates of al-Sulaymaniyah, Irbil, and Dahuk  are caused by the illegal and illegitimate action carried out by  the governments of these four countries when they imposed, by  brute force, a no-fly zone in northern Iraq. They have also  encouraged rebel gangs to tamper with the region.    The official Foreign Ministry spokesman added: Respecting  Iraq's independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity has  one expression, namely, stopping the interference in Iraq's  domestic affairs and lifting the illegal and illegitimate ban on  flights in northern Iraq imposed by the governments of these  states.    The official spokesman denounced the fact that the press  statement issued by the representatives of the four countries  addressed the internal situation in Iraq and spoke about it in  the language of a custodian. The spokesman said: Iraq strongly  condemns this rude attempt and thinks that the press statement  issued in Ankara reflects the true interventionist policy  pursued by the Government of the United States and its allies  against Iraq and the region.    The official Foreign Ministry spokesman asserted that the  Iraqi leadership and people will not allow any party to  interfere in their domestic affairs and that all attempts by the  governments of the countries that seek to perpetuate the  abnormal situation prevailing in northern Iraq will definitely  fail. Our Kurdish people in Iraq will be the first to defeat  these attempts.    On the stand of the Turkish Government, the official  spokesman said that the Iraqi Foreign Ministry has cautioned the  Turkish side through a number of official memorandums declaring  that Turkey's participation in the illegitimate and illegal  actions of the Americans and their allies in northern Iraq  contravenes the relations of good-neighborliness and runs  totally counter to the UN Charter, international law and the  Iraqi-Turkish border treaty of 1926.    The Iraqi Foreign Ministry has also frequently notified the  Turkish side that Turkey's problems should not be tackled by  depending on the abnormal situation created by the Americans and  their allies in northern Iraq and dealing with outlawed rebels  who are wreaking havoc in the region. We also cautioned our  Turkish neighbors against the gravity of double policies and  double-dealing. We told them that such policies cannot but cause  more difficulties and gravely harm Turkey's interests as well as  Iraq's, especially since the Americans and their allies care  about nothing but their selfish interests and wicked ambitions  in the region. They will neither respect Turkey's nor anybody  else's interests.</p>

Vice-Premier Aleksandr Shokhin said in an interview with the  same programme it would be wrong to speak about a change in the  government policy. "The question is that we are entering a new  period, a new phase of the economic policy, and this new phase  means that we must do thorough, routine work, hard work. It is  impossible to promise an abrupt improvement of overall  performance in three or six months, the vice-premier stressed.    Itogi also interviewed Boris Fedorov who declined to join  the  new government as finance minister. He said it was impossible  to continue "a normal economic policy" as long as Viktor  Gerashchenko remained the chairman of the Central Bank of  Russia. According to Fedorov, inflation in Russia will soon  reach at least 30 per cent a month.    Responding to a question about his possible role in the  parliament to which he had been elected Fedorov said he intended  to engage in "constructive criticism of the government but not  in political gambling. The interests of the state are above  all".    Fedorov categorically denied rumours that he had met the  U.S.  ambassador in Moscow a short time ago to ask him for a job.    Both Itogi and the independent television analytical  programme Voskresenye discussed the recent drop in the rouble  exchange value against the dollar after January 13. According  to experts, the panic buying was provoked by two main factors:  the end-of-the-year and payments aimed at offsetting inflation  and Yegor Gaydar's resignation.    Asked by Itogi about his view on the plummeting of the  rouble  last week, Central Bank Chairman Viktor Gerashchenko said that  the fall was due to "several factors, both economic and  political". Gerashchenko stressed that the resignation of Gaydar  and Fedorov "cannot mean a change in the policy which is  objectively necessary".    The Central Bank chairman said inflation in January and  February would amount to approximately 20 per cent, and may  reach 25 per cent in February when debts to some industries will  have to be paid. He said the debts have reached 2.5 trillion  roubles.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Installments No 79-82 of the serialized memoirs of Xu </F> Jiatun: "Xu Jiatun's Hong Kong Memoirs"]  <H5>  [22 Jul 93 p 2] </H5>   [Text] The Course of Expanding Chinese Capital (part  5 of 5): Li Xiannian Warns Against Using Chinese Money To Make  the British Look Good; Central, Local Governments' Funding for  Chinese-Funded Organizations Is Limited    At one time, the development of Mainland Chinese-funded  organizations in Hong Kong worried some local Chinese. First  they worried about the Chinese merchandise wholesalers. In the  past, China controlled foreign trade mainly through the China  Resources Company which in turn sold its products through local  wholesalers. After reform and opening up, the foreign trade  system was restructured in steps, and MOFERT allowed some  products to be managed directly by various ministries and  commissions, provinces and municipalities. Once again the  localities rushed to find managers and agents for their own  products, jeopardizing the profit of the original Chinese  merchandise wholesalers. This had to be changed; it was  inevitable. To the Hong Kong merchants, although the original  wholesalers were hurt, some new agents in Hong Kong benefitted,  because the provinces and municipalities, ministries, and  commission still had to operate through the Hong Kong market;  overall, it was a win-some, lose-some situation, a situation not  entirely avoidable.    The Working Committee discussed the situation internally and  determined that the original wholesalers should be looked after  as much as possible. For example, they should be introduced to  various provinces and municipalities, ministries and commissions  to get new sources of merchandise. They also asked China  Resources Company to come up with new businesses and pay some  kind of compensation and so on.    The launching of Chinese-funded businesses was based on  diversification. At first, many Hong Kong people worried that  the mainland Chinese-funded organizations had state funds, and  so whether they were making money or not, they could go on,  making it impossible for the Hong Kong people to compete with  them. Such businesses existed, but they were the minority. There  were rumors circulating in Hong Kong that the Chinese-funded  businesses had brought this much or that much money to invest in  Hong Kong. Some estimated the amount to be $8 billion, others  suggested $10 billion. Looking at the Chinese-funded  organizations' total investment, those numbers obviously were  exaggerated. Those who said that the money had come from the  mainland obviously did not know what they were talking about.    Back then, Mainland China was making every effort to absorb  foreign funds. How could they have brought so much money to  invest in Hong Kong? This was what Li Xiannian and Chen Yun were  worried about. Li Xiannian once said, "We need money. We cannot  take money from the mainland to invest in Hong Kong to make the  British look good."    As far as I know, there were two types of funds being  invested in Hong Kong. The first was state or local government  appropriations. Such funds were limited in amount. The few  fairly large sums, as I understand, came from the following  sources: One was funds the state allocated to the several large  corporations such as China Trust and Investment Company and  Everbright; they could not have been more than $300-500 million.  Another was the $100 million allocated to XINHUA SHE's Hong Kong  branch. Individual provinces and municipalities could not have  appropriated anything close to $100 million, and even though  some central government ministries and commissions might have  more money, they could not have reached $100 million. Thus, if  we add them together, the sum would be around $1 billion.    Another type was funds some pertinent provincial and  municipal departments had earned and kept while doing business  elsewhere and which they invested in Hong Kong. China Resources  Company and Bank of China handed over some of their profits each  year, but they also retained a percentage. That was normal. We  could not rule out some corruption and irregularities with  respect to the retained profits of the provinces,  municipalities, ministries and commissions; but it could not  have been a huge amount. It was estimated at that time that  retained profits came to about $1 billion, and adding the $2  billion or so appropriated by the state, the sum would be $3  billion at the most.    Thus, if the Chinese-funded organizations did indeed invest  $8-10 billion in Hong Kong, then most of the money was Hong Kong  money, or we could say that it was money borrowed from Hong Kong  banks. The development of Mainland Chinese-funded organizations  in Hong Kong was in some ways facilitated by the mainland, and  on that basis, they also learned from Hong Kong's market  experience in order to grow.    Back then, the Chinese-funded organizations in Hong Kong  grew  fairly rapidly and played an increasing role in the Hong Kong  market. But based on the general estimate that they had $10  billion invested, it was still not much compared to society's  total investments, and they could not begin to threaten or  replace Hong Kong's British or Chinese capital. Thus, Mainland  Chinese capital's growth in Hong Kong was basically healthy.    Practice proved that the general principle of developing and  strengthening Chinese capital was a positive move. It  contributed to the mainland's reform and opening up and to Hong  Kong's stability and prosperity; they helped and benefitted each  other.  <H3>  V. Consolidating Hong Kong's Chinese-Funded Organizations  (Part 1 of 3) </H3>   Chinese-funded organizations in Hong Kong became somewhat  chaotic in 1987 and 1988. There were complaints from the public.  For example, some units did not know what they were doing and  were making some wrong decisions; they were defrauded and  suffered loses. Some set up parent companies, subsidiaries and  sub-subsidiaries, thus over-expanding themselves. Some  management personnel were involved in corruption, bribery, and  fraud, and to some extent, things got out of control. [End of  Installment No. 79]  <H5>  [23 Jul 93 p 4] </H5>   [Text] Consolidating Hong Kong's Chinese-Funded  Organizations (Part 2 of 3): Ji Pengfei Suggests Checking Out  Everbright and China Trust; Zhao Ziyang Instructs Everyone To  Leave Everbright Alone    The State Council, the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office,  and MOFERT wanted to consolidate the Chinese-funded  organizations in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong and Macao Working  Committee pointed out that the overall development of the  Chinese-funded organizations was basically healthy, but there  were some problems, and some rectification was necessary;  however, the consolidation process should not obstruct their  development, and we must not use the same measure across the  board but should deal with different situations in different  ways. For example, Guangdong and Fujian provinces had a fairly  large number of businesses in Hong Kong. Guangdong not only had  provincial and municipal companies but even its counties and  townships had set up businesses in Hong Kong. They had many  connections, and most people came to Hong Kong on personal  connections, and it was impossible to estimate the actual  figure. In those situations, some companies could be abolished  or merged. But other mainland provinces and municipalities had  few organizations in Hong Kong, and for the sake of opening up,  they had asked to set up new businesses, which was fair.    Upon checking and registering, we had approximately 2,000  companies in Hong Kong, and after consulting the provinces and  municipalities, ministries and commissions, we decided to keep  more than a thousand. Meanwhile, some necessary adjustments  were made to their business operations.    On the matter of corruption and irregularities within the  Chinese-funded organizations, there were many complaints.  Someone made a speech at a Beijing meeting and wrote to the  newspapers about the serious situation of corruption and  malpractices within the Chinese-funded organizations. I asked  the person to provide some facts and expressed our sincerity in  seriously investigating and remedying the charges. He only gave  us some information on some minor matters, in sharp contrast to  what he had described in his speech and article. There were  other merchants complaining to us about similar situations, but  when I asked them for specifics, they could not deliver. It is  my guess that there could be two possibilities: First, someone  was blackmailing or bribing them, and they did not want to  provide any information, fearing that it might jeopardize future  businesses. Another possibility may be that it was all hearsay,  and so they could not substantiate their charges. No matter  what, we did not ignore the matter. We knew that there was a  serious problem in certain units, and certain famous  personalities in some large companies were deeply involved. Yet,  it was difficult to conduct an investigation; we needed evidence  before we could deal with the matter. Reportedly, a certain  manager had a large bank account. Hong Kong banks are bound by  law to keep their clients' business confidential. It made  investigations impossible.    At a related meeting in Beijing, Ji Pengfei suggested the  State Council sent people to investigate Everbright and China  Trust. I agreed and seconded his suggestion.    Everbright was founded after Wang Guangying [3769 0342  5391],  CPPCC vice chairman, paid a visit to Hong Kong and submitted a  report to the State Council, and with Zhao Ziyang's approval,  funds were allocated by the state and the business was started  in Hong Kong. Wang was given permission to manage real estate  and stock. Zhang Jingfu [1728 0513 1133], secretary general of  the economic leading group, was put in charge and was in direct  contact with Wang Guangying.    When Wang Guangying arrived in Hong Kong, he drummed up a  lot  of publicity; it was sensational. He boasted that his special  rank put him above that of a minister, that he was one of the  nation's leaders, and that he was making investments on behalf  of the State Council. The company name, "Guangda"  ["Everbright"], was approved by Zhao Ziyang. Wang said that at  first they had thought of naming it "Ziguang," but Zhao thought  that it was inappropriate, and they chose "Everbright" instead.    At the beginning, Wang Guangying was very ambitious. Back  then Hong Kong's real estate market was in a slump. His dealings  with Li Ka-shing [2621 1367 2052] regarding Garden City created  quite a stir in Hong Kong. He said that it was a move based on  his optimism in Hong Kong's future. But then he backed out of  the contract soon after.    There were objections to Wang Guangying's management style  and internal administration in the pertinent departments in  Beijing and within Everbright itself. Everbright's cadres were  handpicked by Wang himself, and after arriving in Hong Kong,  those who agreed with him were trusted, but those who disagreed  with him were discriminated against and alienated. When Wang was  still a target of the Tianjin City Party Committee's united  front, a united front cadre had looked after him and had thus  won his trust. He was later transferred to Everbright, but  because he disagreed with Wang on something, he was immediately  rejected. Subsequently, cultural revolution-like measures were  adopted inside the company; criticism sessions were held, and he  was accused of wrongdoings. The cadre reported to the relevant  units in Beijing and to the Hong Kong-Macao Working Committee.  We tried to get a handle on the situation and asked questions.  For that reason, Wang Guangying was upset with the Working  Committee.    I went to Beijing to discuss the matter with Zhang Jingfu.  He  said, "He is beyond my jurisdiction." He told me to go directly  to Zhao Ziyang. I did. Zhao said, "From now on you should leave  Wang Guangying alone." I told Zhang Jingfu what Zhao had said.  He shook his head, "You should get Zhao to put it in writing."  How was I doing to get anything in writing? Soon thereafter,  Zhang Jingfu told me, "I won't touch the Everbright matter  either. There is nothing I can do."    A 29 year-old wealthy businessman, Zhang Shaohuang [1728  1421  4106], who claimed to be an Overseas Chinese from South America  suddenly showed up in Hong Kong and dove deep in the real estate  business. There were all sorts of speculations about him. Zhang  opened a company in Hong Kong and invited me to the  ribbon-cutting ceremony. The company had the support of  Beijing's Song Jingling Foundation. Song Jingling Foundation's  chairman was Kang Keqing [1660 0344 3237], Marshal Zhu De's  wife; its vice chairman was a deputy director of the General  Office of the Central Committee whom I knew well, because  whenever I visited Beijing, I was received by him. He personally  told me that elder sister Kang had asked for my support. He  said, "This Mr. Zhang is very patriotic. He is enthusiastic  about mainland affairs and has donated HK$2 million to the  Chinese Children's Welfare Fund." So I agreed to attend the  opening ceremony. Zhang Shaohuang advertised his company's  opening, saying that yours truly would take part in the  ribbon-cutting ceremony. (End of Installment No. 80)  <H5>  [24 Jul 93 p 2] </H5>   [Text] Consolidating Hong Kong's Chinese-Funded  Organizations (Part 3 of 3): Zhang Shaohuang Hides Wang  Guangying To Commit Fraud; Wan Li's Son, Wan Zhongxiang, Rated  the Best in the Princelings Party    Just to be safe, I checked out Zhang Shaohuang's company  registration. The registered capital was over HK$10,000, but  actual upfront money was only HK$2. I sensed something was  wrong. When the deputy director of the General Office came to  Hong Kong to participate in the opening ceremony in the capacity  of vice chairman of the Song Jingling Foundation, I did not meet  him but sent Qiao Zongzhun [0829 1350 0402] instead. When he  came back, I questioned him, and he too felt that something was  wrong. Reportedly, Zhang Shaohuang had sent out invitations to  many business tycoons, but none showed up.    Further investigations conducted by a pertinent department  revealed that Zhang was Wang Guangying's future grandson-in-law  and was getting financial support from Wang and led an  extravagant life.    Soon thereafter, Zhang Shaohuang's fraud case was exposed: A  Liaoning company in Hong Kong thought that because both Song  Jingling Foundation's elder sister Kang and Wang Guangying  supported Zhang, this man had to be trustworthy and therefore  lent him HK$200 million. Upon getting the loan, he donated HK$2  million to the Chinese Children's Welfare Fund and used the rest  of the money to speculate in real estate. When the Liaoning  company became suspicious and wanted to get the money back,  Zhang had vanished. Negotiations through lawyers and some of  Zhang's cohorts helped recover some of the money.    The State Council's restructuring of Everbright took place  after "4 June." I don't know the details.    There were also many complaints about China Trust. According  to rectification and improvement information released by  Beijing, China Trust was meddling in illegal foreign exchange  management. Most people believed that there was more to it. The  Working Committee alone received many complaints.    The "rectifications" of these two large companies were  handled directly by the State Council, and despite the Working  Committee's reports to Beijing on the public's complaints, the  State Council failed to follow up.    As far as I know, nearly 200 sons and daughters of  high-ranking cadres were doing business in Hong Kong. I had Qiao  Zongzhun keep in frequent touch with them and work on them,  hoping that they would not get into trouble; otherwise it would  have an adverse effect internally and externally. Qiao Zongzhun  introduced me to some of them, and I told them that I would  support their normal business activities in Hong Kong as much as  I could and hoped that they would abide by the laws and  regulations of the Hong Kong market and keep personal and  business matters separate. Indeed many of them were able to do  that. The person making the best impression and displaying the  most upright workstyle was Wan Li's son, Wan Zhongxiang. Those  making the worst impression were a certain person's son-in-law  and a certain person's son. The two mixed their public and  private lives, made lots of money, and led extravagant lives.  One has already emigrated to Australia. The central authorities  were going to transfer him back to the mainland, but he had  already gone. The other is still in Hong Kong, making money. The  Working Committee had no evidence and could not conduct an  investigation, and the reports went unnoticed. There was nothing  anybody could do.    At the beginning, Xue Wenlin [5641 2429 2651] was in charge  of the Xinlong Company, a XINHUA SHE subsidiary. He had been a  vice president of the Bank of China's Hong Kong-Macao  Administrative Office. The Beijing headquarters wanted him to  retire, and I asked to borrow him and kept him in Hong Kong,  making him CEO and general manager of the Xinlong Company.    Xue Wenlin was in charge of Bank of China's Singapore branch  at one time. He was familiar with situations in Singapore. After  he went to work for Xinlong, he and a Singapore businessman got  together to form a company, dealing with leather and herbal  medicines. He was swindled: He hired a cadre, a transferee from  Shanghai, who delivered a letter of credit and paid out $2  million before the other side had delivered the merchandise.    An investigation revealed that possibly it was part of a  setup. The Shanghainese cadre's wife and the Singapore  businessman together owned a company, but we had no proof.    The Xinlong Company lost nearly HK$10 million with its  stocks  in the market crash of 1987. Adding the money defrauded, it lost  more than $10 million--more than HK$100 million. Under the  circumstances, we decided to replace the company leaders. On  Zhou Ding's [0719 7844], secretary of the Working Committee's  Macao branch, recommendation, we replaced Xue Wenlin with Sun  Kaifeng [1327 0418 7364], general manager of a Shenzhen company.    The person in XINHUA SHE also in charge of business in  Xinlong Company was deputy director Zheng Hua [6774 5478]. He  often inquired about the company's detailed business, but he  also missed some opportunities. For example, when Xue Wenlin was  still in charge of the company, the owner of Hong Kong's  Qingfeng Theater wanted to sell the property and was asking for  a little more than HK$200 million. They sounded out Xinlong.  Since Qinglung was one of the major movie theaters, Xue Wenlin  was eager to buy; the Cultural and Education Department was  enthusiastic too. They sought out Zheng Hua who brought up the  matter for discussion at a meeting. I supported the move, but  since Zheng Hua took no position, out of deference for him, I  said, "detailed business matters are up to your CEO and general  manager. We need not discuss the matter. It is your decision."    Two months later, I read in the newspaper that they had not  bought it. They missed a good opportunity.    We certainly paid a price in the reform and development of  the Chinese-funded organizations in Hong Kong, but  business-wise, some progress was made. More importantly was that  they learned a lot about management and business administration  in the capitalist world market and made and unified a lot of  friends.

The book enumerated the characteristics of Hong  Kong's accelerated economic development and discussed each in  brief. Those interested should indeed get hold of a copy of the  book.    Hong Kong is very small in area. Hong Kong Island, Kowloon,  and the New Territories together measure only a little over  1,000 sq m. Hong Kong has few natural resources. But in the  40-some short years since World War II, Hong Kong has developed  from a poor, backward colonial city into a world-renowned  financial, trade, ocean shipping, information, and tourist  center, becoming an international metropolis founded on the  service industry. There is no denying that it was a miracle.    Today, Hong Kong is among the richest cities. A few years  ago, Mr. Lin Hang-chih [2651 5887 2972] of HSIN PAO said, "Based  on total wealth, every person in Hong Kong is a millionaire." I  am afraid they have far exceeded that today. Whether based on  Chinese statistics or Western statistics, Hong Kong's per capita  GNP is approximately $15,000, catching up with Japan's. A recent  newspaper report said that Hong Kong ranked 90th in population  but 10th as an economic entity in the world, surpassing many  large countries. In 1992, it exported $40 billion's worth of  goods. Amazing.    While many regions around the world are in an economic  slump,  how come Hong Kong is still growing? The reasons are very  interesting.    People say heaven, earth, and men are working in Hong Kong's  favor. Indeed, Hong Kong may be small in area, but it is  perfectly situated geographically, with mainland China at its  back while facing the main Pacific and Indian ocean shipping  lanes head on. Whether one is going from east to west or north  to south, Hong Kong is a midway station. Victoria Harbor is wide  and deep; it never freezes, and it is one of the world's best  natural harbors.    Hong Kong may lack natural resources, but after World War  II,  for geographic reasons, it became a political and economic  buffer zone between the two major camps. It became the political  and economic safe haven for mainland China and even some  Southeast Asian countries and regions, which brought Hong Kong  new resources, that is, cheap labor, valuable talents, and ample  funds.    Hong Kong may be a colonial city, but in the post-war era,  England has slowly changed the way it ruled and has adopted a  policy of control through conciliation. Instead of absolute  dictatorship, it gradually adopted a smart policy known as  consultative democracy. On economic matters, they actively  pursued a policy of nonintervention, creating a fairly good  investment environment, including "hard" environment and "soft"  conditions, in Hong Kong. The so called "soft" conditions refer  to the set of laws and policies, especially the low and  limited-scope tax policy, drawn up by the Hong Kong government,  as well as the subsequent setting up of the Independent  Commission Against Corruption [ICAC] that ushered in an honest  government policy. "Hard" environment refers to the set of  planned modern municipal constructions, including financial,  transportation, telecommunications, and other service  facilities, so that the Hong Kong people are brought into full  play in a great investment environment.    After the founding of New China, Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai  decided not to take back Hong Kong immediately. They removed all  interferences and resolutely adopted the general policy of  "long-term planning and full utilization" to stabilize Hong  Kong, and only with that was Hong Kong able to maintain a  long-term stable political environment. China's reform and  opening up created a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for Hong  Kong's economic development. Thus, China was a determining  factor in Hong Kong's development.    The first time I went to Hong Kong, a local capitalist said  something that made a very deep impression. He said, Hong Kong  has emerged from a narrow crack by utilizing every opportunity.  I admire the Hong Kong people's vigor in taking advantage of  every opportunity. Wherever there is an opportunity, they will  seize it; not just opportunities in Hong Kong or in the  mainland, but worldwide. They have become increasingly skillful  at seizing opportunities; they have set increasingly higher  standards. This in fact is a positive spirit of adapting to  changes, a spirit of holding on to every opportunity and not  letting go. This is an important reason behind Hong Kong's  development.    We can say that Hong Kong takes full advantage of every  political and economic opportunity in the international domain.  It took advantage of the Korean war and the Vietnam war to  become not only one of the U.S. military supply and  reconnaissance bases, but because China broke the blockade, Hong  Kong in fact became a base for smuggling foreign products into  the mainland. Many Hong Kong entrepreneurs who eventually  prospered had started out as smugglers. It not only benefited  them personally but also benefited Hong Kong.    When the world economy evolved, the well-developed  capitalist  nations' economy changed from being labor-intensive to  capital-intensive and technology-intensive, and in the process,  Hong Kong seized the opportunity and used its cheap labor to  sell its low-cost products to other nations, especially the  United States. Back then, Hong Kong had a large quota. It became  a major export center for textile goods in the late 1970's by  taking advantage of that transformation of the world economy.

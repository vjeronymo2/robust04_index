			<p>BFN     [Text] Today, the board of Ukraine's Internal Affairs  Ministry held an extended meeting. It examined the situation in  the Republic of Crimea and adopted an appeal to the Supreme  Council and president of the Crimean Republic, as well as the  board's appeal to the interior bodies' personnel. It says, in  particular, that a dangerous precedent was set for ignoring the  laws of the Ukrainian state, which is having a negative effect  on the functioning of interior bodies in Crimea and, first of  all, the state of law and order. An explosive situation is  being provoked and mounted, suspicion and mistrust for the  Ukrainian authorities is being planted.    The board of Ukraine's Internal Affairs Ministry is placing  all responsibility for the current developments in Crimea and  the possible unforseen consequences on Mr. Valeriy Kuznetsov,  appointed to the abolished post of the Crimean internal affairs  minister, and the forces that had created conditions for this.    Appealing to the Supreme Council and president of the  Republic of Crimea, the board of Ukraine's Internal Affairs  Ministry is counting on them to exercise foresight, wisdom, and  consideration in their decisions concerning issues that relate  to the functioning of such an important armed formation as  interior bodies. The appeal also contains an expression of  confidence that the Crimean leadership will revise their earlier  decisions.</p>

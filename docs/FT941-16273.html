			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / UK Company News: New betting head is appointed to Ladbroke Ladbroke yesterday unveiled the first of what are expected to be several senior management appointments when it announced that Mr Mike Smith, a director of Bowater, is to head its betting and gaming division. Mr Smith, 47, will also sit on the Ladbroke main board. He is expected to take up his appointment at the end of May. Ladbroke said last Friday that Mr Cyril Stein, who headed the group for nearly four decades, would not stay on as a non-executive director. The announcement was seen as a attempt to ensure a fresh start for Mr John Jackson and Mr Peter George, who took over as chairman and chief executive respectively at the beginning of the month. Ladbroke is also expected to announce a new chief executive for its Hilton International hotels subsidiary. The group, whose other interests are do-it-yourself retail outlets and property, said last year that it was talking to Mr Michael Hirst, the current head of Hilton, about his future. These discussions were still going on. Mr Smith held senior positions in the car industry before moving to Grand Metropolitan in 1984.</p>

			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Private View: Man who plays jester at the court of Du Pont ON HIS business card it says 'Strategic Thinking'. But Michael Geoghegan likes to describe himself as the court jester, the man who can tell home truths in the throne room without getting his head chopped off. He is the Irishman at the court of EI du Pont de Nemours, the US corporate giant which has sales of nearly Dollars 40bn and employs 144,000 people in chemicals, man-made fibres, polymers, industrial, consumer and medical products, oil, gas and coal. His job, rare in corporate America, is to tell the bosses of Du Pont's fibres division what is going on in the world outside their office windows and to alert them to the dangers of Darwinian extinction. Qualified in chemistry, business administration and social science, Dr Geoghegan (pronounced 'Gaygan') enjoys displaying his eclectic knowledge. 'I know some of the leading thinkers round the world, and six or seven Nobel laureates personally,' he said immodestly. But he also has a knack for the sweeping pronouncement - 'there is no recession' - and a Joycean flair for caricaturing the rituals of the American managerial class. After 25 years with Du Pont he still speaks with the heavy accent and finger-jabbing insistence of the man in the Dublin pub. If you are slow to take a point, his voice rises to a passionate squeak. Not surprisingly for one educated by the fearsome Christian Brothers and in the quasi-monastic surroundings of Garbelly College in western Ireland, Geoghegan makes much use of the clerical analogy. Business is like the Church, and just as hidebound: middle managers are 'the priests in an old hierarchy', corporate planners 'monks serving the priesthood of the management'. He can be elliptical. When I first asked him to explain what he did, he rattled off a discourse in which geopolitical change, the 'core / shell' concept, Schumpeter, thermodynamics, the transistor and quantum mechanics, biotechnology and multimedia communication all made an appearance. I asked him to be more precise. 'Take nylon chemistry,' he said. 'As the social system becomes more aware of the consequences of nylon in the general social system we will begin to modify the kinds of chemistry we do.' I don't understand, I said. 'OK. You take Tienanmen Square,' he said, somewhat mysteriously. 'What's happening over there is a function of the technology. We do certain chemistries and they have ecological balances which affect the social system. You cannot do chemistry today that pollutes the local ecological system.' What's that got to do with information technology? 'That's how they found out] We've always had problems in ecology, but what happens when you find out about it? You see, that's the whole point.' But what's different now? 'People get concerned about their own self-interest because they're now aware.' Because they watch more television, you mean? 'Exactly]' Geoghegan's message is that economies are stagnating because companies have not learned how to manage the consequences of the information technology explosion. Wealth, he says, is today based on information not mass, on complexity not volume. Sand is turned into silicon chips. Companies are confused because customers armed with computer terminals can design and demand the products they want. 'There's a whole new milieu caused by free switching. We threw free switching into the world. This has made every individual their own designer but businesses are trying to hang on mightily to their own theory. 'General Motors says: 'I'll tell you what car to buy.' So they make the wrong car, cheaper. They keep failing and they don't know why. Ross Perot put it very well: what it takes to get ahead in General Motors has got nothing to do with how to build a better car. Of course not]' Information is too widely disseminated to be controlled by the bosses, and so the old hierarchy is redundant. 'You're not telling people what to do any more; you're giving them intellectual and physical resources so they can do what is possible.' But, I interrupted, what you are describing is known to the marketing manager and the production manager, too. What can you add? 'What you just said isn't true. In the social theory of the corporation people act in order to get promoted. The organisation, like Du Pont, is a totalitarian system. It is based on infantile behaviour. You please the boss, and so forth. There are very clear but unstated, undiscussable, camouflaged sets of rules about getting ahead. 'But if you continue with that social theory you will make investments which move you further from what's happening in the world.' You mean people are investing in themselves all the time, not in the company? 'Of course] They've been talking to each other mostly all their lives. So there's a little game going on in the village and they make decisions in their own interest. They have a natural blindness to what is happening in the world. Martin Luther was a real problem to the Catholic Church. So was Galileo. The system will act to conserve its own structure - who is allowed to talk to whom about what. 'A lot of people knew we were coming to the end of this and went on a massive greed binge in the Eighties. It's not surprising CEO salaries went through the roof because intuitively there was this feeling: We're coming to the end] They used to think they were running the company. Now they know they're not.' The management consultants, gurus and quacks, saw what was happening and profited handsomely from the panic, Geoghegan said. 'The Harvard Business School put out a lot of bullshit. The Sloan School talked about 'empowerment' - you know, all these tons and tons of books of management stuff. 'Why do you think that happened? Because they thought: 'If these guys are shaky and sick, my God we've a goldmine] So feed 'em all this bullshit.' And they lapped it up. How do you keep your job? Answer: a good line in bullshit and a pulpit.' What's the most unpopular thing you've ever said to the top management of Du Pont? 'Oh, that buying Conoco was not a good idea. (Du Pont bought Conoco in 1981 for Dollars 7.6bn, one of the biggest US acquisitions of its time.) You could see the price of oil was going to go down. Maybe we should have paid Dollars 5bn for it.' You must be seen as a busybody by a lot of the people there. 'I wouldn't say busybody. People would say that I am, you know, very intelligent, whatever the hell that means, and they sort of sense I am up to something. But I am very threatening to any specialised group because I talk about a change of agenda. The higher up I get the less I seem to have a problem. 'I'll tell you what drives me. I've been in Du Pont when we had what I call 'ego space': plenty of wonderful problems to solve. We now have a contraction of ego space. Seeing the scarcity, people get nasty, aggressive, territorial. It's unpleasant. So that's the problem. 'Some people are artists. I am a kind of composer. I have to orchestrate the process of redesigning the social structure of the company.' Is the fact you're a foreigner useful? 'I think it helps. You know, I think having an Irish accent helps. Maybe they think I'm a little nuts. Maybe that helps too - what the hell]' And your religious education? 'Extremely important. Because if you're brought up as a rigid Irish Catholic and then you have to dismantle all that, you know what it means to transform your belief system.' (Geoghegan regards himself now as more of a Buddhist or Taoist.) Are you still an Irishman? 'My genetic code says Yes. But that doesn't mean anything. I'm of the cosmos. Nationalism is a disease. 'Because I emigrated I have some idea how social structures work. Believing is seeing. It's not the other way round. What you believe, you see. 'I've had the chance to see there are these different ways of looking. So it's no accident I have taken on this task. There's no way a vice-president of Du Pont could do what I'm doing. It's not in his karma.'</p>

			<p><P> January 17, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HOLY LAWSUIT! ADAM WEST TAKES ON AD  AGENCIES  </P> <P> As Batman, television actor Adam West was accustomed to battling such villains  as the Penguin and the Joker. But in Burbank Superior Court on Tuesday, West  took on a more substantial foe -- a group of advertising agencies he alleges  stole his characterization.  </P> <P> West, who portrayed the caped crusader in the campy 1960s television series, is  seeking $900,000 in damages from the agencies for producing a television  commercial featuring another actor as Batman. West, 51, testified that the  actor used gestures, mannerisms and speech patterns similar to ones he used in  the series.  </P> <P> The suit names three agencies -- Ian Leech &amp; Associates of Los Angeles,  Ingalls, Quinn &amp; Johnson of Boston, and BBDO New York. Anthony Liebig, an  attorney for the agencies, said they purchased the rights to portray Batman  from DC Comics, which originated the character.  </P> <P> "Actors perform roles, they don't own them," Liebig said. "If you want to do a  commercial using Robin Hood, do you have to go deal with the estate of Errol  Flynn?"  </P></p>

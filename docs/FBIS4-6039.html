			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Kim Chang-yong] </F>   [Text] The newest chapter in the international trade order  will be a mixed blessing for the Korean economy and its  advantage, or disadvantage, will be chiefly dependent on how the  nation copes with it.    It will ease all tariff and non-tariff barriers, making the  world a border-less market for globally competitive companies.  It will simultaneously mean a losing game for less competitive  companies even in their home markets.    "The world will be exposed to the law of the jungle in which  the lion has the largest share," one economist said, noting "We  can no longer provide visible or invisible shelters for our  industry."    The process of the Uruguay Round [UR] negotiations, which  brought a victory to the United States and the European Union  and a negative impact, if not a defeat, to most other economies,  was a "fierce war itself" as the Federation of Korean Industries  [FKI], the lobbying group of large companies, put it.    Public officials and private analysts cite sharp tariff cuts  for manufactured goods, abolition of non-tariff discriminations  and clarified and justified procedures for the settlement of  trade disputes as some of the potential bonuses to the exports  of Korea's manufacturing sector.    Reinforced regulations on anti-dumping ruling will  particularly save Korean companies from threats and actions by  advanced countries including the U.S., EU and Australia. Korean  products have been slapped with anti-dumping charges from time  to time.    Improved conditions for overseas investment will also draw  foreign capital into the nation, while encouraging local  businessmen to invest abroad.    All in all, manufacturing industries are expected to get  more  than they lose under the Uruguay Round agreement.    Major advanced countries, which have not lowed tariffs since  the start of the multilateral talks in 1986, are obliged to  slash the rates gradually, thus enhancing the competitiveness of  products exported by developing countries and thereby giving  them higher chances of access.    Imports are not likely to jump drastically, officials said,  on the ground that its concessional tariffs are set at 8.1  percent for the 2001, the final year of implementation of the  new round, which is higher than the currently actual rate of 7.9  percent.    The Korean Institute for International Economic Policy  recently estimated exports growth, to be caused by the freer  world trade order, at 2,250 billion dollars on the annual  average.    Imports will grow a meager 720 million dollars, according to  the brain trust for the Economic Planning Board [EPB], the top  economic agency.    The state-run Korea Institute for Industrial Economics and  Trade gave a conservative forecast--a 620-710 million dollar  jump in exports and a 60 million dollar rise in imports.    "The Uruguay Round will be a plus for our economy from the  macroscopic and long-term perspectives," said a high-ranking EPB  official who is campaigning to calm down controversy over what  many Koreans just call "UR." "Korea, over half whose gross  national product comes from trade, has to pursue prosperity  through international economic ties."    The free trade regime will be a great disservice to some  light industries like footwear, textiles and garments, which are  being dogged by products from newcomers including China,  Malaysia and Thailand, needless to say agriculture.    In the agricultural field along, UR damages will amount to  an  estimated 7.7 trillion won (approximately 9.6 billion dollars)  over the next seven years, resulting in the exodus of half of  the rural population to urban areas, according to the Korea  Rural Economic Institute.    The influence of the UR on Korea's economy will be  commensurate with its countersteps.    Assistant Trade, Industry and Energy Minister Chang Sok-hwan  stressed the need for the "decisive role" of private enterprises  in stepping up their competitiveness and image worldwide.    "The settlement of the new trade regulations forces the  administration to trim its intervention in the private sector in  the course of its technical development, trade and other overall  business activities. The government will remain as a supporter  and the private sector will take the initiative in this regard."    Business organizations appeared passive as if they were  little concerned about the drastically new system which  dismissed two agriculture, forestry and fisheries ministries as  scapegoats to appease angry farmers and fishermen, backed by  opposition lawmakers and students in Korea.    The FKI commented, "It is necessary to nurture  competitiveness of some industries that have comparative edge in  the world market. A new economic climate should also be created  in which business activities are subject to market mechanisms."    The Korea Foreign Trade Association called for technological  innovation and management reform, while the Korea Federation of  Small Business regretted the administration's unpreparedness for  the order.</p>

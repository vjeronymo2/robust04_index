Vicendis). Relations  between Colombia and Cuba are favorable and are growing  satisfactorily, the Colombian ambassador said.    [Begin recording] [(Santamaria Salamanca)] One of the first  actions of the recently established Colombian Embassy in Cuba is  to establish immediate friendly relations between Santiago de  Cuba and Cartagena de Indias, in Colombia, to unite those who  already are united, de facto, by history and culture. They are  two peoples with parallel histories, both capitals of the  Caribbean which, thanks to a good initiative of the two  governments, will again strengthen their friendly relations.    Within this framework, we hope to develop cultural and  commercial activities that promote new points of cooperation  between Colombia and Cuba, through Santiago de Cuba and  Cartagena de Indias. We are going to receive visiting Colombian  officials and businessmen for two or three days here in Santiago  de Cuba, and we hope to begin talks between those two sectors. I  would say that Colombia and Cuba are experiencing good, friendly  relations at this moment. Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina  was visiting Colombia at the end of 1993; Vice President Carlos  Lage also met with President Gaviria; and by the end of April,  Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin will visit Cuba. We are  going to have a number of visits. Our relations are at a good  level at this moment. This complies with President Gaviria's  policy of tightening relations with the Caribbean, of  strengthening an international relationship of friendship; and I  am here to begin implementing those guidelines.    [Sanabria] Would it be possible to receive a visit by  President Cesar Gaviria, as well, during the development of  these relations?    [(Santamaria Salamanca)] For the time being, we are working  on visits by two or three ministers, a delegation of Colombian  businessmen, and [Foreign Minister] Noemi Sanin; then will we be  able to plan future objectives. So far, we are working with  these goals, which surely implies relations at a high level,  because for almost 12 years we had no diplomatic relations. [end  recording]</p>

			<p><P> September 8, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HUD ADVISED COSTA MESA TO DELAY POLICY ON ALIENS  </P> <P> After examining Costa Mesa's controversial anti-illegal alien funding policy,  the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development advised the city not to  implement it "until further notice," according to a Sept. 1 letter made public  Thursday.  </P> <P> In the letter, which was not received until after the City Council voted  Tuesday to make the measure voluntary, a HUD official said the policy's  constitutionality is still being reviewed and that the outcome could jeopardize  federal grants to the city.  </P> <P> Mayor Peter F. Buffa released copies of the letter Thursday in explaining why  he did an about-face and led a 3-2 vote to effectively shelve the measure,  which would have withheld city funds from groups that assist illegal aliens.  </P> <P> He said he led the reversal, making the ban voluntary for at least this year,  so the city would not risk losing vital Community Development Block Grant  funds, which HUD oversees.  </P> <P> Although Buffa said Thursday that he knew the letter was forthcoming when he  voted, he made no mention of it to the council. He said he didn't actually  receive the letter until Wednesday.  </P> <P> "I did not want to refer to the letter (during the council meeting) because  then I would only be speculating in terms of what might be in it," Buffa said  during a news conference. "This was at least to some degree my motivation,  because I had been told about a rather clear directive from HUD not to  implement the policy until further notice."  </P> <P> In the three-paragraph letter, HUD advises the city not to pursue the  anti-illegal alien funding policy while its Washington headquarters determines  whether it is constitutional.  </P> <P> "Several questions have been raised concerning its constitutionality,  particularly with respect to the Community Development Block Grant program,"  wrote Benjamin F. Bobo, HUD's regional manager in Los Angeles. "We are  therefore advising the city not to implement the policy as it relates to CDBG  funds until further notice."  </P> <P> At stake is $809,000 in HUD funds that the city is expected to receive in  1989-90, $121,350 of which is allocated for public service grants to a wide  range of civic and social-service organizations. Block grants are given to  cities and local governments by HUD, which issues guidelines on how the money  can be used.  </P> <P> "We don't know what is unconstitutional at this point," said Scott Reed,  spokesman for the agency's Los Angeles office, which serves Southern  California. "We felt it was important enough to forward to our central office."  </P> <P> Reed said HUD might know as early as today whether the policy is legal.  </P> <P> Buffa's policy reversal had drawn fire from fellow Councilman Orville Amburgey,  who originally proposed the funding policy, with Buffa and Councilman Ed  Glasgow in support. And the HUD letter did nothing to soften Amburgey's  criticism.  </P> <P> "Mr. Buffa should have enough guts to say the real reason he's rescinding the  policy," Amburgey said Thursday.  </P> <P> Amburgey said the letter that influenced Buffa to change his mind is nothing  new.  </P> <P> "It's nothing more than we knew from Day One," the councilman said. "I think  we've all said since Day One that if they would withhold the funds, then we  would consider strongly that we would rescind. But (HUD) hasn't said that."  </P> <P> Buffa said he still supports some sort of measure barring funds to  organizations that cater to illegal aliens, provided it can pass HUD's muster  and if the council can give "clear-cut guidance" to city staff on implementing  the plan. In the original policy, health clinics were exempted. But beyond  that, the council had never discussed whether the policy would have applied to  all nonprofit organizations, which would include cable television, cultural  arts and public service groups.  </P> <P> Buffa said the city has received an "overwhelming positive response" for the  proposal from residents.  </P> <P> While HUD is trying to determine whether the policy violates federal guidelines  that prohibit discrimination on the basis of national origin, Buffa said people  are seeing the issue wrongly.  </P> <P> "What we were trying to address here is people who are in the country  illegally," the mayor said. "That immediately became associated in some  people's minds with national origin. At least in my mind this wasn't a question  of national origin. It's a question of people registered, which, in my opinion,  puts it in another category."  </P> <P> Buffa also wondered why the measure is seen as a constitutional issue.  </P> <P> "To view this as a constitutional issue, you have to have the logic to assume  that it's going to be implemented in a discriminatory fashion," Buffa said.  </P> <P> The fact that he is up for reelection next year had nothing to do with his  reversal, Buffa said.  </P> <P> "If I had a change of heart I would have voted simply to rescind the policy,"  Buffa said.  </P> <P> Nor did he bow to pressure from opponents of the policy.  </P> <P> "The outcry was not the point," he said. "The point was we're not going to do  anything that would put the city out of compliance, particularly when we depend  on an agency for our programs."  </P> <P> In defending the proposal, Amburgey said that by supporting groups with illegal  aliens, the city would be in conflict with Immigration and Naturalization  Service regulations.  </P> <P> "It would be strange to me that HUD would recommend anything that would  conflict with INS," he said.  </P></p>

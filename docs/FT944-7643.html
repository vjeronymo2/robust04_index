			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / World markets tumble in wake of Wall Street's decline Share prices fell worldwide yesterday as the aftershock of Tuesday's 91-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average rippled through international stock markets. Traders remained worried about further US interest rate rises, which would slow the US economy and corporate earnings growth. Investors appeared to be selling shares and opting for the higher income from bonds. The shares sell-off continued this morning when the Tokyo market opened. The Nikkei 225 average fell about 200 points in early trading. Brokers said selling was across-the-board. US shares fell again yesterday after steep stock market falls in Europe and Asia. At one stage, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down more than 30 points, with computerised selling programs again responsible for much of the decline. The market later rallied and at the end of the second busiest trading day of the year, the Dow closed only 3.36 down at 3,674.63. Meanwhile, the price of the key 30-year US Treasury bond closed up almost three-quarters of a point, pushing the yield down to 7.94 per cent, its first dip below 8 per cent this month. The Federal Reserve's decision to increase interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point last week - the sixth rise this year - appears to have been a watershed. So far this year, the Dow average of 30 leading stocks has outperformed the broader US market, but investors have now decided to sell the big industrial, or 'cyclical' stocks, which make up much a large part of the Dow. They fear the earnings of these companies will suffer as the Fed's rate increases slow growth next year, and believe government securities offer more security and better returns at the moment. Mr Peter Coolidge, senior equity trader at Kidder Peabody in New York, said: 'I think people feel it's more attractive to put their money in the bond market right now.' In London, the FT-SE 100 index opened about 40 points lower and, with no relief from early Wall Street trading, ended 51.2 points down at 3,027.5, its fifth-largest fall this year. Other European markets fell by about 1 per cent to 2 per cent, with the Dax index in Germany down 1.6 per cent in after-hours trading. Asian stock markets reacted badly to Tuesday's Dow decline. Hong Kong led, with the Hang Seng index dropping a further 4.2 per cent after Tuesday's 3.8 per cent decline.

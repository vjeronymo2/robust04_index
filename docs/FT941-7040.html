			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / International Company News: Watchmaker's car silences the sceptics - SMH chairman Nicolas Hayek talks to Ian Rodger about the Swatchmobile project The very idea that a producer of watches could break into the tough and expensive world motor industry is odd, to say the least. But that is exactly what SMH, the Swiss watchmaking group, known best for its cheap and cheerful Swatches, is poised to do with an environmentally-friendly small car. Even though Mr Nicolas Hayek, the group's irrepressible chairman, was a successful engineering consultant to the motor industry before rescuing SMH, his plans have always aroused more than a little scepticism. The Zurich-based Mr Hayek has long been aware of this, but has gone on immodestly tantalising the world for four years on the near-revolutionary merits of his so-called Swatchmobile. Consumers would love it, and other carmakers would be stunned by its wonderful design features, he would tell all comers. However, the car never seemed to materialise. Mr Hayek initially claimed he did not want to show it to competitors any sooner than necessary, but that just provoked enterprising photographic journalists to spy on the company and produce intriguing pictures. A planned prototype unveiling in 1992 was cancelled. Then a mooted joint venture with Volkswagen collapsed last year. Uncharitable observers began to wonder if the Swatchmobile was simply a stock market car, designed to put some zip into SMH shares whenever they sagged. This week, however, all doubts disappeared. SMH and no less a player than Mercedes-Benz of Germany announced they were setting up a joint venture to produce the Swatchmobile. If all goes well - and that means getting approval from various boards and advisers at Mercedes - the car will finally be unveiled to a curious world at the end of next week. Already, Mr Hayek has clarified the broad outlines of the vehicle. It will be a two-seater - 'enough for two people and two cases of mineral water' - and will probably be on the market in three years, selling for about Dollars 10,000. '(That amount) is on the high side,' he says. There has been much speculation about its engine design. Mr Hayek says three different systems are being assessed. The aim is to produce a car that is not just a city runabout that has to be plugged in every few hours, but also a vehicle you would drive from Zurich to Sicily in the same comfort you would expect in a normal car, he says. Fine, but with virtually every important car manufacturer working hard on environmentally-friendly designs, what do SMH and Swatch bring to the party? Answer: they apply the same approach to carmaking and selling that led to the phenomenal success of Swatches. These are: Simplify and automate production to reduce cost and, often, as a by-product of that process, improve quality. That was Mr Hayek's strategy for beating Japanese competitors in the mass watch market, and it has worked spectacularly. 'Cars have become much too expensive. They can be made much more cheaply,' he says. 'We know we can produce high quality at low cost.' Set prices low. 'The idea behind Swatch is to have no target market. Everyone should buy them, from age six to 120.' The product should be sold throughout the world. While watches can be exported quickly and efficiently from SMH's Swiss factories, Mr Hayek envisions Swatchmobiles will be manufactured in several countries, 'and that does not exclude Great Britain'. Once the deal with Mercedes is sealed, he plans quickly to take up an invitation to visit Mr Michael Heseltine, president of the UK Board of Trade. The product should be 'provocative', expressing 'joy in life'. 'A Rolls Royce or a Jaguar is not just a car, it is a car plus something,' he says. It all sounds a tall order for the Swatchmobile, but it looks as if it will finally be fulfilled. Mr Hayek says SMH and Mercedes have been working on the joint venture for a year, and have resolved a lot of the problems that brought the discussions with Volkswagen to grief. The concept has been approved throughout the Mercedes organisation. 'A lot of detail work has been done,' he says. Mercedes will have majority control, but SMH, with 49 per cent, will have a veto on many issues, according to Mr Hayek. He claims the project is also well within SMH's means, so far taking up no more than between 15 and 20 per cent of the group's cashflow. 'And if it is as successful as we hope, we will keep on investing.'</p>

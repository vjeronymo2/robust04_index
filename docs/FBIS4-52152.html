			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 9 KYODO -- Defense Agency Director  General Atsushi Kanda on Monday [9 May] turned back from an  earlier stance and said he will abide by a longtime  interpretation by previous governments that the Constitution  bans the country from being involved in collective security  arrangements.    Kanda told a news conference that the coalition government  "cannot avoid discussing the Constitution...but I would rather  say Japan should act in accordance with the current  constitutional interpretation."    Shortly after assuming the post of state minister for  defense  late last month, Kanda said Japan needs to apply a more flexible  interpretation to the Constitution regarding the exercise of  collective security arrangements.    Political sources said Kanda might have withdrawn the  earlier  remark out of respect to the No. 2 opposition party, the Social  Democratic Party, which quit the coalition last month and  opposed Kanda's proposal to revise the constitutional  interpretation.</p>

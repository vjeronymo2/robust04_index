			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / EU biotech market may be worth Dollars 94bn in 2000 The European biotechnology market is expected to grow 15 times, to exceed Dollars 94bn (Pounds 63bn) by the year 2000 and create up to 2m new jobs, the management consultancy Ernst &amp; Young said in a survey of the industry, released at a seminar in Amsterdam. 'This industry has emerged from academic science to become one of Europe's most promising industries,' the study said, quoting a European Union advisory group's estimates. The group, formed in 1989, puts the current European market for biotechnology-derived products at Ecu5bn (Pounds 3.8bn), rising to Ecu83bn by the end of the century. Biotechnology companies are expected to raise around Pounds 1bn through initial public offerings on the London Stock Exchange over the next couple of years. This would allow early investors, such as venture capital companies, to cash in their investments and plough them back into the industry to fund new starts. While US companies have found it increasingly difficult in recent months to raise money in stock market flotations, the London Stock Exchange has already attracted more than Pounds 200m in initial public offerings from biotechnology companies since June 1993, when it altered its 'profits track record' rules on profitability for young, emerging pharmaceutical and diagnostic companies. The changes have made London - the first exchange in Europe to adapt its rules to the special needs of fledgling biotechnology companies - an alternative to the US Nasdaq exchange used by some European biotechnology companies. So far, 11 biotechnology companies have found their way to the London exchange, and brokers expect about 20 such companies to be listed within the next 12 months, according to Ernst &amp; Young. The survey also found that the pace of alliances in the European biotechnology sector is set to pick up sharply, partly reflecting a new interest among large pharmaceutical companies in harnessing the technologies developed by smaller, younger companies. The survey findings were presented this week at a conference in Amsterdam organised by Ernst &amp; Young and Atlas Ventures, the venture capital group, to promote partnerships within European biotechnology. At the event, 35 biotechnology companies presented themselves to an audience of 150 potential partners, including not only investors but also representatives from pharmaceutical companies. Mr Steven Burrill, an adviser to Ernst &amp; Young, said that, although European biotechnology companies still lagged behind their US counterparts in finding finance, they enjoy some advantages, one being the quicker product approval by European regulators.</p>

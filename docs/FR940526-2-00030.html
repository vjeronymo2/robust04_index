Financial assistance is being provided to develop or expand capacity of States to prevent disabilities through public health leadership, coordination of services, public health surveillance, technical assistance, and implementation and evaluation of community intervention programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives of ``Healthy People 2000,'' a PHS-led national activity to reduce morbidity and mortality and improve the quality of life. This announcement is related to the areas of Health Promotion, Health Protection, Preventive Services, and Surveillance and Data Systems. (For ordering a copy of ``Healthy People 2000,'' see the section ``Where to Obtain Additional Information.'')  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Authority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This program is authorized by section 301(a) (42 U.S.C. 241(a)) and Section 317 (42 U.S.C. 247(b)) of the Public Health Service Act, as amended.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Smoke-Free Workplace  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Public Health Service strongly encourages all grant recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace and promote the non-use of all tobacco products. This is consistent with the PHS mission to protect and advance the physical and mental health of the American people.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Eligible Applicants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Eligible applicants are the official public health departments of States or other State agencies or departments that: (1) are not current recipients of an award under this program; or (2) are current recipients whose funding ends in FY 1994. This includes the District of Columbia, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and the Republic of Palau.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Except in the case of currently funded States where programmatic relationships are established, State agencies applying under this announcement that are other than the official State health department must provide written concurrence from that agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Only one application from each State may enter the review process and be considered for an award under this program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Availability of Funds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Approximately $4,000,000 is available in FY 1994 to fund 9 to 11 awards. It is expected that awards for States newly funded under this announcement will range from $200,000 to $250,000. It is also expected that awards for currently funded States that receive renewal funding under this announcement will range from $320,000 to $450,000. It is expected that the awards will begin on or before September 30, 1994, and made for a 12-month budget period within a two year project period. Funding estimates may vary and are subject to change. Continuation awards within the project period will be made on the basis of satisfactory progress and the availability of funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The CDC currently funds 28 state-based capacity building projects. Ten of these States will complete their project periods in September 1994. The CDC expects to make non-competing continuation awards to the remaining 18 States in September 1994. Therefore, only a portion of the total FY 1994 national appropriations for State-based capacity building projects will be available to support States competing under this announcement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

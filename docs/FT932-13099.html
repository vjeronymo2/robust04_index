			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / How To Spend It: Caviar and cashmere - Some real bargains at duty-free shops HOW LONG is it since you last bought something other than the odd bottle of booze and some spare film at an airport duty-free shop? If, like me, you arrive with minutes to spare, suitcases packed to the brim and memories of hearing about shams and rip-offs you probably do not even think about it. If you are one of the canny ones who has sussed out that times have changed at airport shops, that duty-free these days really does mean that then no doubt you shop there all the time. Certainly enough people visit duty-free outlets to have sent BAA figures soaring - five years ago retailing brought in Pounds 299m, last year it had risen 60 per cent to Pounds 480m. Those who supposed that the proper business of airports was aviation will be intrigued to learn that retailing now accounts for 32 per cent of total revenue. A combination of falling revenue from landing fees and rising investment costs meant that increased revenue had to be found. Gingering up the duty-free operation seemed an obvious way forward. Unscrupulous pricing, which lead to an embarrassing number of features in the national press, had eroded the confidence of the travelling-classes in 'airside' shopping. Today, much of this has changed. The airport shops between them sell more caviar than the rest of the UK put together. Many retailers do between Pounds 4,000 and Pounds 5,000 in turnover per sq ft each year when the average in the UK is nearer Pounds 400 - in other words, they do 10 times more business than their High Street rivals. Some, like the Swatch shop in Terminal 4, do even better. It did Pounds 6,500 per sq ft in its first year, 15 per cent more than the UK average. The revival started two years ago when Barry Gibson arrived to take over as group retail director of BAA. Confidence had to be restored. He started with what he called his 'Value Guarantee Campaign', which guarantees that in the 'land-side' airport shops prices are no higher than they are in UK towns and cities and that in the 'air-side' shops the prices really are free of duty and tax. The result is that today you can be sure of finding most alcohol at half the price it is in the High Street, tobacco is 40 per cent less, perfumes 21 per cent, and almost everything else from scarves and ties to shoes, watches, cashmere sweaters and gadgetry, 17 1/2 per cent cheaper. Perceived notions, however, take a long time to die, and many travellers believe it is cheaper to buy in Schipol or Frankfurt airports. Barry Gibson is adamant that for most things it is hard to beat the prices in BAA shops. He points out that in some continental countries, Denmark and Germany, for instance, VAT is still charged in duty-free shops. A straw poll revealed that his claims held up well. A litre bottle of Bells whisky sells for Pounds 8.30 in BAA duty-free shops, the equivalent of Pounds 8.82 in European duty-free shops (calculated by using an average of prices in Frankfurt, Amsterdam and Copenhagen) and Pounds 16.61 in the High Street. A litre of Johnnie Walker's Red label was marginally more expensive in BAA shops (Pounds 9.95) than in Europe (Pounds 9.30) but in both places it was a great deal cheaper than in the High Street where it sells for nearly double at Pounds 19.90. An Hermes scarf is Pounds 129 in Hermes town and city shops, Pounds 127 in Europe and Pounds 110 in BAA duty-free shops. On the perfume front, Guerlain's Samsara and Dior's Poison were both cheaper in BAA's duty-frees than anywhere else but unaccountably Chanel No. 5 turned out to cost slightly more (Pounds 36.30 in BAA shops as opposed to Pounds 34.26 in Europe and Pounds 46 in the High Street). So the prices are good but is there anything you actually want? You are not going to find cute little hand-made items, one-off pieces of art or quirky presents - what you will find is classic items that cost you less than they would back home. Many well-known retailers have an outlet somewhere in Terminal 3 or 4 - Harrods and Burberry, Austin Reed and Hamley's, Mappin &amp; Webb and Georg Jensen, Ferragamo and Gucci, Cartier and Jaeger - so the label-loving brigade are well catered-for. If you need a good watch, hanker for, say, a Cartier three-gold ring, want a CD player or a camera, need a shirt or a classic pair of shoes, then, if price matters to you, it may well be worth your while to do some research before you travel. Try on shoes in a Bally shop, suss out what Jaeger has to offer, work out which colour cashmere sweater would freshen up your wardrobe, check out watches and decide which is the one for you. There remains the vexed question of duty. Foreigners heading home will need to check on their own customs regulations. UK residents should probably not buy their Pounds 20,000 Rolex if they are on the way to Hong Kong - it will have to be declared on the way back and the duty paid. But, if, for instance, you are going anywhere in Europe, now that barriers are down, you can buy in the duty-free and do not have to declare anything on your way back in.</p>

			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / New Chiapas peace broker President Carlos Salinas has appointed Mr Jorge Madrazo, the head of the government human rights commission, to be the new commissioner for peace in the Mexican state of Chiapas, indicating a continuing commitment to a negotiated settlement to the conflict. Mr Salinas said Mr Madrazo would be entrusted with bringing a 'dignified peace' to Chiapas. The appointment of the respected Mr Madrazo and President Salinas's commitment to peaceful resolution follows rebel rejection of the government peace offer nearly two weeks ago, and resignation of the previous peace commissioner, Mr Manuel Camacho. 'This raises the possibility and expectation that dialogue can continue despite the Zapatista rejection of the peace agreement,' said a government official. The Zapatista rebels seized four towns in the state of Chiapas on new year's day. Although a ceasefire was reached in early January, the Zapatistas remain armed. Still in control of a southern part of Chiapas, they have threatened to rise up against the government and remain a threat to the security of the state. The call for dialogue may help reduce tension in the area, and should allay fears of a government crackdown. However, Mr Salinas did not meet the central Zapatista demand of agreeing to further national democratic reforms, saying such reforms had been negotiated by the main political parties, and without such a commitment, it seems unlikely an agreement can be reached.</p>

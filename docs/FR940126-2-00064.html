This Notice announces an extension of the deadline for applications for the NOFA for the Opportunities for Youth: Youthbuild Program which was published on September 23, 1993, at 58 FR 49849, until January 31, 1994. The Department has decided to extend the deadline for all applicants that completed the preparation of an application by the original application deadline of January 7, 1994, but were unable to meet the submission deadline for all or part of the application because of weather and other delivery problems. The new deadline is to accommodate applicants who encountered such problems and is not intended to generate new applications. Applications received by HUD between the original deadline date of January 7, 1994 and the date of publication of this notice will also be accepted for processing. In addition, all applicants may revise parts of their applications if they wish and submit the revised parts or the revised application by the new date of January 31, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department will announce a new NOFA later this year for the next Youthbuild funding competition. Those parties interested in developing a new application will have the opportunity to apply for funding consideration during the next funding round.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> II. The Youthbuild Program, as established by the NOFA published on September 23, 1993, at 58 FR 49849, and the proposed rule also published on September 23, 1993, at 58 FR 49830, provides for the Department to reserve up to five percent of the program funds for emergencies. The Department has decided that the recent earthquake in the Los Angeles area is such an emergency and that the Department will act promptly on applications received from Los Angeles city and county and award up to $1.9 million for implementation grants to applicants from Los Angeles. The Department intends to review the implementation and combined applications received from Los Angeles city and county by the deadline on an immediate basis. If applications meet the thresholds set forth in the September 23, 1993 NOFA and score at least at the minimum level (60 points with at least 15 points in capability and 30 points in feasibility and quality), they are eligible for immediate award. If there are more eligible applications from Los Angeles city and county than can be funded under the $1.9 million, applications rating the highest will be funded. Any other applications not funded under this emergency fund will be considered in the regular Youthbuild implementation funding competition. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: January 19, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Andrew Cuomo,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;1565 Filed 1&hyph;25&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 4210&hyph;29&hyph;P <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

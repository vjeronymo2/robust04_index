			<p>920210 FT  10 FEB 92 / Treasury asks for forecasting input from industrialists TOP INDUSTRIALISTS are to be invited to an advisory panel to feed insights on economic trends to the Treasury under a plan to improve the government's forecasting record and strengthen dialogue with business.

Mr John MacGregor, leader of the Commons, is co-ordinating a broad government effort to improve relations with industry.

Senior business representatives welcomed news of the initiative. Mr Miles Middleton, president of the Association of British Chambers of Commerce, said the Treasury had made a 'fundamental mistake' in recent years in not talking enough to people from industry. He added that the Treasury's forecasting record was 'lousy'.

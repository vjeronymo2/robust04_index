The speakers said that the New Year address of President Kim  Il-song is a highly important guideline to which the Korean  people should hold fast this year. They called for stepping up  the general onward march of socialism in the revolutionary  spirit of self- reliance and hard struggle by further  strengthening the might of singlehearted unity.    They said that they would successfully fulfil this year's  plans for socialist economic construction by making continued  innovations and uninterrupted advance in the spirit of Chollima  spurred on by the "speed of the '90s" under the militant slogan  "Let us hasten the general march of socialism in the  revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and fortitude".    They declared that they would, with unfailing loyalty to the  party and the leader, make continued innovations and  uninterrupted advance in the fighting spirit which was displayed  during the rigorous war and in the same spirit and stamina with  which they brought about a great upsurge of Chollima in the  difficult post-war period and thus make 1994 a year of  historical advance in the Korean revolution and construction.</p>

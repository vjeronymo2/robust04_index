			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Survey of Wales (2): Private sector role is crucial - Regeneration IN the centre of Merthyr Tydfil stands a large notice. Redevelopment of the shopping heart of the town is being undertaken, the board states, by Chesterfield Properties in conjunction with the borough council assisted by the Welsh Office and an urban grant. The Merthyr project is only one of more than 30 town-centre schemes being undertaken across Wales. Nearly all of them are partnerships between the public and private sectors. Urban regeneration has become one of the most important parts of the work being undertaken by the Welsh Development Agency, which is quietly in the background of the Merthyr scheme. 'The essential characteristic of the programme is that it should be seen as a joint venture' says Mr David Farnsworth, director of the agency's urban development department. 'We are attempting to bring all sides together for the benefit of the areas involved.' A record Pounds 30m is being spent this financial year, Mr Farnsworth says, in towns ranging from Holyhead in the north to Barry in the south, from Milford Haven in the west to Caldicot in Gwent and Wrexham in Clwyd in the east. Some are large: at Holyhead, capital investment of Pounds 3.31m is being undertaken while Merthyr has been allocated Pounds 3.2m. Elsewhere the sums may be relatively small: Pounds 150,000 in Pontarddulais to develop the town's proximity to the M4 motorway or Pounds 200,000 in Conwy to make part of the centre a pedestrian precinct, improve the flow of traffic through the historic town and improve parking for the thousands of visitors who flock in during the summer. The urban programme is geared towards investment in those places which have the potential to become growth sectors of the Welsh economy. 'We bring together public and private finance to create greater value and enhanced quality of investment,' Mr Farnsworth says. 'The involvement of the private sector is crucial because this is just as much a partnership as that successfully launched by the agency a couple of years ago to produce more investment in the property sector.' Although there have been urban development schemes undertaken in Wales for some years, a co-ordinated programme did not really get under way until 1990 with the arrival of Mr Farnsworth at the agency's Cardiff headquarters. In 1990-91 the WDA put just Pounds 4.8m into urban regeneration, which was supplemented by Pounds 5.8m from the private sector. This year the agency will pump in Pounds 30m which should attract another Pounds 60m from the private sector and in 1994-5 the agency's budget is planned to be Pounds 35m while it expects the private sector to put in Pounds 120m. 'Between 1990 and 1995 we expect some Pounds 240m of private-sector money to have been levered in the Welsh economy,' Mr Farnsworth says. This spending is not just on new shopping centres or traffic-management schemes. Landscaping and new infrastructure work is taking place this year in Llanelli; business development projects are being pursued in the Cynon Valley; and tourism facilities are being improved in Holyhead. There is land reclamation at Barry; dockside redevelopment at Caernarfon; improved car parking at Caerphilly; a new access to a superstore site will be built at Pontypool where there are plans to make the canal more attractive to visitors; and an indoor market and the De Valence pavilion will be redecorated at Tenby. 'Large or small, these are all seen as enhancing the growth potential of their areas,' says Mr Farnsworth. The biggest of the joint-venture schemes is taking place at Swansea, Wales's second city. Swansea has already undertaken a large amount of new investment, building a barrage across the river Tawe, a marina and maritime quarter, an enterprise park and a hotel, all with official support from a variety of quarters. Over the next five years it expects to invest about Pounds 27m from the public sector alone on improving the city's accessibility, its traffic management, clearing sites, attracting hotels, smartening property, and building houses, offices and factories. The city believes this will attract Pounds 200m by the year 2003 which could lead to another 6,700 jobs being created directly and a further 4,500 indirectly. Plans such as this have led to the European Commission taking a close interest in the way Wales is managing its urban programme. 'We are attempting to change traditional approaches,' Mr Farnsworth says. 'The traditional management of towns has been to spend money on a problem when it arises. But towns are too complicated for such a simple approach. 'We are seeking now to make opportunities the most important factor. Instead of taking a departmental approach such as any borough director would do, we are looking at a town's economic needs and finding the most satisfactory solutions.' Earlier this year Mr Farnsworth and his team were asked by the European Commission to discuss their methods. Brussels officials are keen to see how the Welsh approach to public-sector management can be used elsewhere in the Community. It is one way in which the Welsh approach is leading Europe.</p>

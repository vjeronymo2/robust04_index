			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / International Company News: Itoman dissolved in merger scheme JAPAN'S era of financial excess has claimed its most famous victim. Itoman, a once staid textile trader turned property and art speculator, is to be dissolved under a merger proposal announced by the Sumitomo group yesterday. Itoman, founded in 1883 as an importer of fabric, is to be merged with Sumikin Bussan, a steel trading subsidiary of Sumitomo Metal Industries, a core company of the Sumitomo group, which has taken responsibility for the restructuring of Itoman. The proposal, under which five Itoman shares will be swapped for one share in the unlisted Sumikin Bussan, reflects the influence of keiretsu, or corporate groupings. Itoman executives said they had attempted to salvage the company, but were hampered by the economic slowdown. They also announced what was likely to be Itoman's last profits forecast - an after-tax loss of Y90bn (Dollars 720m) for the year to end March, when the company is to be delisted. Meanwhile, the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) said it would look into trading of Itoman shares in recent days, when volume has been higher than average. Any further scandal linked to Itoman would continue a two-year run of unflattering headlines at a company which was not alone in indulging in speculation. Sumikin Bussan emphasised that it would take over none of the debts of Itoman, which still has an extensive international trading network in textiles, food, and industrial machinery. Itoman was estimated to have Y1,300bn in consolidated debt at its speculative peak in 1990, before the collapse of the stock, property and art markets. After the arrest of seven men last year in connection with alleged corruption, prosecutors said speculation in golf courses, the works of Modigliani, and apartments had caused losses of Y300bn. The company has attempted to trade its way out of trouble, but was forced to approach Sumitomo Bank, its main bank, for financial assistance in restructuring. The bank proposed the merger with Sumikin, which is 59.5 per cent owned by Sumitomo Metals. Attempts to restructure Itoman were hampered by the negative publicity the company has attracted over the past two years. The turmoil at Itoman is cited as a reason for the fall of Mr Ichiro Isoda, the Sumitomo Bank chairman, who resigned in 1990. The close connection with the bank has been highly embarrassing for the Sumitomo group, as, in 1990, 13 of Itoman's 47 executives had worked for the institution, and the trading house's customers had believed its investments came with the bank's blessing. Itoman's ill-fated foray into property markets was once cited by executives as an indication of its successful diversification away from traditional trading pursuits. Ironically, Sumikin said yesterday that the Itoman merger was a part of its diversification strategy.</p>

			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / International Company News: Miller Brewing to close brewery and shed 1,200 jobs Miller Brewing Company, the second biggest brewer in the US, yesterday announced it was to close its Fulton brewery in upstate New York next year with the loss of all 900 jobs. Another 300 jobs are to be cut from its other brewing operations. The company is owned by Philip Morris, the US cigarette, food and brewing group, which last Wednesday outlined plans to cut 14,000 jobs as part of a worldwide restructuring aimed at defending its brands against price competition. Two days later Philip Morris detailed the first of the cuts when it announced that 800 hourly-paid and 100 salaried employees would be cut from the workforce of its cigarette manufacturing operations in Richmond, Virginia. Miller Brewing Company, which makes Miller Lite, the world's top-selling low-calorie beer, employs 9,000. It has been struggling in the face of stagnant beer sales in its domestic market caused partly by a doubling of the federal excise tax. Mr John MacDonough, the subsidiary's chairman and chief executive, said Miller had more production capacity than it needed and the cost of retaining it could not be justified in an extremely competitive environment. 'By closing our Fulton brewery, we would be able to eliminate significant fixed expenses while still meeting demand in the north-eastern US through production at our other eastern plants,' he said. The brewery will be closed in two phases next year: the first on January 31 and the second by October 1. Production will be transferred to Miller breweries in Eden, North Carolina; Albany, Georgia; and Trenton, Ohio. The remaining 300 jobs to go are salaried posts at Miller's Milwaukee, Wisconsin, headquarters and six other breweries.</p>

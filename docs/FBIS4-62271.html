			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, 12 May (BUSINESS-TASS) -- Russia's foreign  debt (not counting its indebtedness to Eastern European  countries and overdue commercial payments) at the start of 1994  exceeded 80 billion dollars. That figure is cited in a  memorandum drawn up by the State Duma Committee on the Budget,  Taxation, Banks, and Finances.    The annual payments that Russia was committed to make under  the schedule for servicing debt and repaying principal in  1992-93 were in excess of 20 billion dollars. However, thanks  to successful negotiations with creditors Russia was able to  limit itself last year to paying out only 2.2 billion dollars.  During the current year the Russian Government intends to pay a  further 4.7 billion dollars.    Last year Russia obtained from foreign governments credits  totalling 4.4 billion dollars. The biggest creditor was  Germany, which provided 2.4 billion dollars. The top three  creditors also included France (providing 680 million dollars)  and the United States (providing 671 million dollars). Our  eastern neighbor, Japan, provided only 140 million dollars in  credit, but nevertheless, it outstripped Canada, Turkey, and the  Netherlands.    In 1994 the government is expecting to obtain credits  totalling 2.8 billion dollars. Germany will keep its lead in  this sphere. It will be followed by Italy, the United States,  and Japan, which is proposing to increase the amount of its  credit by 150 percent.    Almost half of the foreign credits last year went to  agriculture and the food industry, in the main for grain  purchases, while the rest went to industry, transport,  communications, municipal services, environmental protection,  the medical industry, and the purchase of medical supplies.    In 1994 it is planned to direct the credits in the main to  industry and agriculture. A total of 650 million dollars will  be earmarked for the medical industry and the purchase of  medical supplies. In comparison with last year it is planned to  reduce 13- fold the outlay of credits for the purchase of  grain--to 100 million dollars.    At the same time, Russia has continued providing foreign  states with credit. In particular, credits have been issued  over the past two years to India, Cuba, Algeria, and Pakistan  totalling 1.8 billion dollars.</p>

			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Murder scandal golf HOW NICE, now that the UK election is over, to get back to a normal daily intake of murder, mystery, mayhem, scandal, sex, golf, recipes and post-feminism, and to reflect that no-one who lives and votes in Britain need scan or ingest a single wacky story about polls or politicians for at least a couple of years - until murder, mystery, mayhem, scandal, sex and golf wreak implacable havoc in the constituencies and we are cast, like gnomes down a well, into a fresh round of election madness. Not that I didn't enjoy the election. I am not one of those people who finds elections boring, or argues that there is nothing to choose between the parties anyway. Yet even my patience can be tested to collapse by newspaper editors' penchant for poll-based punditry. Which is why I have spent the past few days luxuriating in the discovery that there is life beyond elections - that there are things going on, just as they always have, in a fluttery, whimsical dance towards the end of time. Take sport. I expect you thought that the clamour of the UK election was so great that something as intrinsically silly and marginal as horse racing had quietly folded its tents and stolen into the night, never to be heard from again. Not a bit of it. On and on it goes: hundreds of races daily, trillions' worth of bets, all of it conveyed to readers of the sportspages in the special lackey-prose in which horserace-writers have to sit a degree before the Jockey Club allows them on to a racecourse. Henry Cecil, the famed Newmarket trainer? You thought he had expired? Gone to a higher pasture? Not a bit of it. He is still winning races, just as he did at the start of his career in 1836. Golf? You thought that golf had quietly died? Absolutely not. In Georgia, a man called Fred Couples won the Masters last weekend and is apparently set fair to become 'the first truly dominant American golfer since Tom Watson', whoever he was. Cricket? I am afraid so. Rugby? But of course. Soccer? Badminton? Gymnastics? Snooker? Speedway? Squash? Utterly and absolutely. In fact, more than there was before. Another commodity surfing through the newspapers in greater and greater quantities than anyone can recall is sex. On Thursday I bought the Mail, Express, Sun, Star, Today, Mirror and Sport. They were awash. What priceless comics they are, especially the first three. I won't quote specifics, because journalists on posh papers who entertain their readers with synopses of mucky stories from the comics are generally accused of voyeurism, which is not something to relish. But the sap is rising fast, and is seeping into the qualities, especially into The Times, a paper I admire. On Wednesdays it runs a column by Lynne Truss called Single Life, which is probably doing more to inflame the circulation of The Times than 1,000 columns of punditry by tiresome Peter Riddell. This week, the wonderful Ms Truss was writing about the onset of warmer weather and how it affects her mind, especially when confronted by 'blokes with squeegees who haunt the traffic lights at Vauxhall Cross . . . They are, I fancy, generated out of the swirling grit of Vauxhall by the mystical action of the sun, like crocodiles from the mud of the Nile.' As you know, I am related to all the Fleet Street editors. The next time one of them asks me how to infuse his publication with sap and vitality, I shall tell him to cut his number of political columnists to one, purge his payroll of in-house intellectuals, cancel his market research contract, dispense with bleary polls, forget about elections - and ponder the words of Ms Truss, who has more bubbles than Perrier and is the sort of writer editors will have to woo and flatter if they hope to steer their publications over the reefs of media fragmentation (more and more titles chasing increasingly specialised readerships) without splintering like matchwood. For good cheer, though, nothing could equal an editorial in Thursday's Mail, which read in part: 'Oh to be in Britain now that April's here and the election is over. 'Birds are nest-building. Househunters are eyeing the estate agents' windows with new, predatory enthusiasm. And, despite the continuing economic chill, there is an unmistakable scent of recovery in the air . . .' It's a pity they haven't heard about that asteroid careering towards Earth.</p>

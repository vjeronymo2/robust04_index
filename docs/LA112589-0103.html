			<p><P> November 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> Jockey Julie Krone was thrown from her horse and kicked during a race at the  Meadowlands when her mount stopped abruptly, track officials said.  </P> <P> Krone, the all-time leading rider at the Meadowlands, was rushed to Hackensack  Medical Center and was being treated for a broken left arm, a nursing  supervisor said.  </P> <P> Meadowlands spokeswoman Ellen Harvey said video tapes reviewed by track  officials showed that Krone's horse, My Rolin, was spooked by a shadow and  stopped short. Krone appeared to have been kicked at least once by My Rolin and  was probably kicked by the trailing horse as well, Harvey said.  </P> <P> Earlier Friday, Krone agreed to accept a 15-day suspension and $500 fine  imposed by track stewards in September after a fight between Krone and another  jockey. Krone had been appealing the suspension.  </P> <P> Stewards tacked on an extra five days and $100 fine to Krone's suspension for  lodging a frivolous complaint, the raceway said.  </P> <P> Krone is required by the suspension to be out of action between Dec. 4 and Dec.  23, the last race of the season, track officials said.  </P> <P> Krone's suspension stemmed from a fight on the track with jockey Joe Bravo on  Sept. 23. She was suspended and fined for unsportsmanlike conduct and misuse of  the whip.  </P></p>

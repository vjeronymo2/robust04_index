			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / European Bonds: Irish treaty referendum sparks rally EUROPE'S government bond markets shed their gloom and rallied as Ireland voted in favour of the Maastricht Treaty on Friday, thereby reviving hopes of European economic and monetary union (EMU). Having spent much of the last week nervously waiting for the Irish referendum to take place, the bond markets rose quickly on the news that Ireland's voters had said yes to Maastricht by a tidy majority. The chief beneficiaries were the higher-yielding markets: Italy, Spain, France, the UK and the Ecu bond market. All of these - but particularly the Italian, Spanish and Ecu bond markets - were hit severely when the Danes overturned the convergence apple-cart by voting against the treaty on June 2, and they have suffered further falls subsequently due to uncertainty about the prospects for EMU. However, Ireland's referendum result revived confidence that the EC would succeed in pushing ahead with EMU, and not surprisingly it was the high-yielding markets which showed the strongest gains after the vote. However, it seems likely that the sense of optimism will be brief. Indeed, not all of the high-yielding markets managed to hold on to their gains on Friday. Spain, France and the UK fell as investors and dealers took profits, and the immediate future is unlikely to hold much hope of a strong rally. 'The whole episode of the last two weeks (since the Danish referendum) has made investors more circumspect about convergence,' said Mr George Magnus, international economist at SG Warburg. 'Even if the politicians say we are back on the road to monetary union, people are more suspicious and will tend to look at the domestic fundamentals in future.' The Maastricht Treaty has to be ratified by all 12 member countries. France is due to hold a referendum in the autumn. As the date approaches the markets could well suffer bouts of nervousness, particularly as investors concentrate more closely on the economic problems of the high-yielding markets, especially Italy and Spain. Italy has had a particularly rocky ride since Denmark voted against Maastricht. The combination of political and economic problems and devaluation fears sent investors scurrying for safer D-Mark assets after the Danish referendum. Last week, the Italian bond market see-sawed wildly. News of a solution to the country's political problems and rumours that withholding tax on bonds would be removed helped to lift the market, but devaluation fears wiped out the gains. Italy has been without a government for about two months. Last week, President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro named Mr Giuliano Amato, a Socialist, as the new prime minister. While the Italian bond market took heart from the appointment of a prime minister, economists were quick to point out that Mr Amato's chances of success would depend on the formation of the new government. The other positive factor - news that the withholding tax on Italian bonds will be lifted - also proved only a temporary boost for the market with many traders remaining sceptical. 'There has been a tendency to circulate rumours regarding the lifting of the withholding tax when the currency and/or the bond market are in deep trouble. This is one of those situations,' said Mr Karim Basta, an economist with Merrill Lynch. Indeed, the Italian bond market spent much of last week being buffeted by devaluation rumours. The Bank of Italy was forced to raise its emergency funds rate from 12.5 per cent to 13 per cent shortly after the Danish referendum in order to protect the lira. However, the currency remains susceptible to devaluation rumours and the news that one of the large US securities house expects to see a 5 per cent devaluation in the lira caused further alarm in the markets on Wednesday and Thursday. This prompted the central bank to intervene in the foreign exchange markets to support the currency and to deny the possibility of a currency devaluation.</p>

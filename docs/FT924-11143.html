			<p>921027 FT  27 OCT 92 / Washington link to Iraq Super Gun THE Bush administration granted an export licence in 1989 that enabled Space Research Corp, the Belgian military research company controlled by the late Dr Gerald Bull, to send sophisticated US technology to Iraq's Super Gun project, according to US government documents. The documents, obtained by the Financial Times, include a 1989 Commerce Department licence for the export of a supercomputer and other high-technology items used to design the projectile to be shot from the Super Gun. The gun was a 1,000mm cannon constructed to shoot projectiles over long distances. Dr Bull, the Canadian rocket scientist who worked for Iraq's President Saddam Hussein on the gun, was murdered in Brussels in 1990. There was speculation he had been assassinated because of his work on Iraqi arms projects. The US documents will be detailed in Senate testimony this morning by Mr Henry Gonzalez, the House banking committee chairman who has spearheaded congressional investigations of the Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL) Iraqi loans scandal. Mr Gonzalez has previously confirmed that Dr Bull's company was financed by BNL's Atlanta branch. The latest revelations appear to conflict with other public and private statements from the Bush administration: In April 1990, for example, a cable sent to US embassies by Mr James Baker, then secretary of state, said the administration had learned of Space Research Corp's involvement in Iraqi missile programmes. The cable, also obtained yesterday, urged the governments of Britain, France and others to clamp down on exports from Dr Bull's company to Iraq. In February 1991, according to another new document, State Department officials were advised to say they had not approved 'any exports of equipment or technology by Bull or companies associated with Bull to Iraq'. The 1989 export licence clearly stated Dr Bull's US exports would be shipped from Baltimore to Brussels and then on to Iraq. The documents, along with statements made by Dr David Kay, former inspector of Iraq's weapons projects, also directly contradict the assertion made by President George Bush during a debate last week that no US technology went to Iraq's weapons programmes. In Washington yesterday the Justice Department said it had named Mr J. William Roberts, a federal prosecutor from Illinois who was appointed to a senior job during the Reagan administration, to head a new BNL task-force investigation. He is to help follow up leads relating to possible criminal conduct of officials of BNL's Rome headquarters, and allegations of wrongdoing by Bush administration officials.</p>

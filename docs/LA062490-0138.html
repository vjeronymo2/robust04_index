			<p><P> June 24, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONSUMER REPORT: STRATEGIES THAT HELP THWART CRIME ON THE ROAD;  </P> <P> CRIME: IT PAYS TO KEEP A LOW PROFILE AND STAY ALERT WHEN YOU TRAVEL.  PICKPOCKETS AND OTHER THIEVES THRIVE ON DISTRACTING THEIR VICTIMS IN BUSY  PLACES.  </P> <P> Extraction follows distraction.  </P> <P> Remember those words and you might save yourself a lot of grief at crowded  travel sites such as airports, sightseeing attractions, hotel lobbies and  department stores.  </P> <P> Thieves around the world are using a variety of "distraction-extraction"  techniques to make off with travelers' suitcases, briefcases, wallets, purses  and other possessions. Often disarmingly simple, these techniques are still  quite effective.  </P> <P> "Thieves take advantage of existing confusion or create their own confusion,"  said Capt. Bernard Wilson of the Los Angeles Airport Police. "When your  attention is diverted, they make off with your items."  </P> <P> One example is when someone drops coins on the floor. While people watch the  coins roll, stop them with their feet or even bend down to pick them up, a  thief is busy separating the victim from the desired items.  </P> <P> Similarly, someone can purposefully let a suitcase flop open, then quickly  feign a flustered look and start gathering up the items. Helping someone pick  things up can prove costly for the good Samaritan, who is victimized during his  good deed.  </P> <P> Another dodge is to drop a $1 or $5 bill, or a pen, on the floor and ask  someone if it belongs to them. While the person is responding, he or she may be  victimized.  </P> <P> Spilling something on a traveler, such as soda or coffee, is another popular  technique of thieves. While you're cleaning up -- and the person who did the  spilling even attempts to help out -- someone else is removing your goods.  </P> <P> Being asked directions sounds innocuous enough, but it can be a way to draw  attention. The same holds true when someone asks to borrow a pen or asks for  change for a dollar. Being bumped is frequently a means to separate you from  your wallet.  </P> <P> Watching people argue, or engage in related commotions, also can be diverting.  But the "disturbance" can easily be staged, and the thieves are at work while  you're taking in the "performance."  </P> <P> In each scenario, the traveler runs the risk of being ripped off while they're  reacting to the situation. You can be particularly vulnerable any time you have  to put things down -- such as briefcases and carry-on bags -- or while making  phone calls, eating, drinking or checking tickets.  </P> <P> Glancing at magazines and other reading material in airport gift shops can pose  a problem, if you put your bags on the floor while you read. Your possessions  are out of your grip, and you've provided your own distraction. The longer you  read, the greater the risk.  </P> <P> "The more things you have to watch, and the more things you have to take care  of, the more vulnerable you are," Wilson said.  </P> <P> "Try to travel with less items, and get into the airport's secure area as soon  as you can. There's less chance of a problem after you pass through screening."  </P> <P> Thieves -- particularly those that work airports and terminals -- act in  groups. One thief takes the item, then passes it to a second person, who may  slip it into a shopping bag, coat, newspaper or their own larger briefcase.  </P> <P> One good rule to help counteract thieves is to never leave your items  unattended, even for a brief moment. The longer something is left unwatched or  out of sight, the stronger the chances are of it disappearing.  </P> <P> To protect yourself against pickpockets, put your wallet or billfold in an  inside coat or side trouser pocket, not in rear pockets (called the "sucker  pocket" by thieves). Even when buttoned, rear pockets are a bad place to keep  wallets. You're much more likely to feel a pickpocket attempt when your wallet  is in a front pocket.  </P> <P> Placing rubber bands around a wallet can create the feeling of friction if  someone tries to slip it out of your pocket. Just putting your wallet in a coat  or suit jacket may not be good enough, especially if you don't regularly carry  your wallet there.  </P> <P> "You may not be sensitive to the sensation of less weight when it's slipped out  by a pickpocket," Wilson said.  </P> <P> Make sure that pocketbooks are always kept shut. Women should make sure that  they put wallets all the way back into their bags after making a purchase  instead of leaving them at the top. Put the straps of the bags around your  hands, and keep both bags and pocketbooks tucked close to your body.  </P> <P> Women should also consider carrying money in secure pockets in their clothing  rather than in bags and purses. Velcro pieces and zippers can be sewn into  garments.  </P> <P> Any time you're jostled or bumped, immediately turn quickly to break possible  contact with a pickpocket, then check to see if you've lost anything. If you  are the victim of a pickpocket and know who did it, call out quickly for help.  </P> <P> "Yell out what's being stolen and identify it as much as possible, such as: 'He  took my red suitcase or my blue purse,' " Wilson advised. "This makes it easier  to spot a stolen item."  </P> <P> Try to keep an eye on the suspected pickpocket until you can get the attention  of the airport police or other security personnel. Avoid direct confrontation,  and remember that the thieves often pass items to accomplices, which can make  apprehension and regaining your possessions difficult.  </P> <P> When using an airport cart designed to be pulled behind you rather than pushed  in front of you, secure smaller items by putting them under larger units or  connecting them to bigger pieces.  </P> <P> If you do have many pieces to be concerned about, consider the use of a  cable-bicycle lock. "Locking various items together means a thief has to take  everything," Wilson said. "The lock also tells thieves that you're alert to the  danger of being robbed."  </P> <P> Overall, following three basic rules of security provides the most effective  defense against travel misadventures of this type:  </P> <P>  -- Know your adversary. This means realizing that thieves are likely to be  found in any crowded and hectic area, that they often work in groups, and that  you are pitted against professionals who know how to distract and quickly rob  you.  </P> <P>  -- Keep a low profile. Thieves select victims who look like they have  something worth taking and who appear vulnerable. Don't present yourself as a  suitable target by wearing expensive clothing and accessories, toting  pricey-looking briefcases and baggage, and flaunting a good deal of cash or  credit cards.  </P> <P> Try to minimize the amount of cash and credit cards you take on a trip.  Carrying traveler's checks, which can be replaced if stolen or lost, instead of  cash is also a good idea. When more than one adult is traveling together, split  the money -- both cash and credit cards -- and other items of value between  them.  </P> <P>  -- Stay alert, which isn't always easy when you're concerned about making your  plane, you're tired after a long flight, or you're engrossed with any of the  many details of traveling. Thieves, of course, thrive on the vulnerability such  situations create.  </P></p>

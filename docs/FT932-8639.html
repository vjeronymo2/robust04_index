			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / Results of EC-wide poll show fall in support for integration A EUROPEAN Community-wide poll showing a fall in support for European integration has been withheld by the European Commission until after today's referendum in Denmark on the Maastricht treaty. Senior Commission officials say the Eurobarometer poll, carried out by independent national market research organisations under the aegis of the Commission, shows a sharp drop in support for European unification in Spain, Portugal and Greece, which until recently were solidly behind the Community and Maastricht. The survey took place before last week's latest devaluation of the Spanish peseta and Portuguese escudo. But a similar survey last autumn, just before the crisis in the exchange rate mechanism for EC currencies, triggered strongly negative reactions in the UK, Italy, Spain, Portugal, and Ireland - all of whose currencies ended up either having to devalue or float. Three senior Commission officials confirm that Brussels decided to hold back the latest Eurobarometer survey until the Danish referendum is over, even though all recent opinion polls in Denmark point to a Yes vote. Formally Commission officials in charge of the poll say although the results are ready, publication has been held up until May 25 by procedural delays. Officials who approve the interpretation of the results were only due to get the figures last night. The survey results this time last year were released on May 15. In 1991, in the run-up to the Maastricht treaty, the spring survey emerged on May 2, brimming with Euro-enthusiasm. In spring 1991, 80 per cent of those polled supported 'efforts being made to unify western Europe', with only 11 per cent against. A year later, in the wake of the Maastricht summit, the majority was still 76 to 16 per cent. Even by last autumn, the last published Eurobarometer poll after Denmark's rejection of Maastricht, 73 per cent favoured unification with 19 per cent opposed. In last autumn's poll there were absolute majorities for the treaty in only six countries; relative majorities (excluding the 'don't knows') in four; and majorities against in the UK and Denmark, the two countries holding up ratification. In Spain and Portugal, however, half those polled were undecided.</p>

			<p>Layoffs   <F P=102>   BR0103125094 Munich SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG in German 5-6 Feb  94 p 31 </F>  <F P=103> BR0103125094 </F> <F P=104>  Munich SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG </F> <F P=105>  German </F> BFN     The group works council of Munich-based German Aerospace AG  (DASA), which is threatened with mass layoffs, has called for an  emergency state program in favor of regions and locations  particularly affected. At a two-day meeting in Bonn also  attended by Bundestag deputies and members of the Federal  Government, the workers' representatives also appealed for  measures that would safeguard the German aerospace industry in  the long term. Speaking with journalists on Friday, group works  council chairman Alois Schwarz called for a program funded to  the tune of 2 or 3 billion German marks [DM] as a "start to  medium- to long-term planning."    The management of Daimler group-owned DASA had announced,  last fall, that at least 16,000 jobs would be lost and six  factories closed. This, claims a group works council statement,  would jeopardize the very being of the DASA group. The  incomparably high innovation and investment outlay in this  sector could not be met by the industry alone; targeted funding  by the Federal Government was needed. The state had to maintain  control over production for military purposes; the laws of the  market economy should not be the only guiding principle of  business; parliament and the government should create the  premises that would at least maintain the German aerospace  industry at its current level. From the political point of  view, the technical expertise DASA represented was just as worth  preserving as the coal, steel, and shipbuilding industries or  agriculture.    The group works council summarized its long-term demands  under seven heads:    1. Financing of a research and development technology  program, for example for new materials for use in aircraft,  helicopters, and spacecraft. Schwarz criticized the fact that,  although a new fiber- reinforced composite had led to the  development of a new automobile steering wheel column, the  automobile industry had not adopted the new material;    2. Support for passenger aircraft construction;    3. Definition of projects and programs for unmanned defense  systems; and    4. Interceptors and transport aircraft. The Luftwaffe should  state its requirements for helicopters and other transport  aircraft. Oskar Pauli (Dornier, Friedrichshafen), seconded by  the CDU/CSU [Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union]  deputy Bundestag floor leader, Kurt Faltlhauser (CDU), called  for the decision on the F-90 to be brought forward and taken  before the end of 1994: If the decision were not taken for  another two years, DM75 million would be required just to  preserve capacity;    5. Close coordination of the Bundeswehr's maintenance and  logistics work with the industry;    6. Improvement of German companies' capacity for  international collaboration within the EU; and    7. A diversification and conversion (swords to plowshares)  funding program; the funds available under EU programs should be  used and not be allowed to lapse.    Schwarz criticized the fact that, although up to 10  conversion products had already been available from MBB  [Messerschmidt- Boelkow-Blohm] in Ottobrunn and Garching in the  eighties, the management had dropped these lines when MBB had  been taken over by Daimler-Benz in 1988, pending the formation  of the new group. The result had been a stagnation in the  conversion effort. The products developed at that time were no  longer salable, said Schwarz, criticizing the company  management's poor judgment: "There is a glut on the market."  Schwarz said that only entirely new products, in civil  aviation, for instance, held out prospects of success, but this  would require massive financial aid both from the group's parent  company, Daimler, and from the state.    Pauli expressed satisfaction at the response of the  politicians attending the conference; in addition to  Faltlhauser, these included the Federal Government aerospace  coordinator, Reinhard Goehner (CDU), and SPD [Social Democratic  Party of Germany] floor leader Hans-Ulrich Klose. "What we have  seen today is a great coalition in favor of research and  technology," said Pauli, summing up the views expressed by the  politicians. A step forward had been taken. It would have to  be followed up firmly over the following weeks and months.  Pauli criticized the planned DM1.25-billion cut in the defense  budget and the DM250-million cut in the research budget. When  savings had to be made, the aerospace industry was always first  in line.</p>

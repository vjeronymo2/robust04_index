			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [by ITAR-TASS correspondent Gennadiy Yezhov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 25 May -- The Ukrainian delegation at the  Moscow intergovernmental talks on settling the problem of the  Black Sea Fleet has agreed to continue work on one of the four  Russian options for dividing the fleet which had earlier been  rejected. As a reserve, the Russian party has one more option  -- the "presidential" -- which is still to be revealed.    An ITAR-TASS correspondent has learned on the sidelines of  the talks between the Russian and Ukrainian government heads  that the attempt to harmonize the positions of the parties,  which are at times mutually exclusive, is experiencing great  difficulties. The talks process has already gone on for three  days. The chief stumbling-block lies in the conflicting  approaches of Moscow and Kiev to the principle of separate bases  for the national fleets.    Both delegations have held repeated consultations with their  presidents using the telephone "hot" line. Russian Prime  Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and acting Ukrainian Prime Minister  Yefim Zvyagilskiy met several times today. However the main  work is being done by the working group of experts.    It is expected that the sides will draw up the final text of  the intergovernment agreement on beginning the division of the  Black Sea Fleet. If this happens, the document will be signed  by Viktor Chernomyrdin and Yefim Zvyagilskiy, the heads of the  delegations of Russia and Ukraine at the talks.    One way or the other, the talks will end this evening, since  Viktor Chernomyrdin leaves for an official visit to China after  2000.</p>

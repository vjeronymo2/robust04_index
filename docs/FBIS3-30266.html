Security Council. In the  letter, Jovanovic informed the Security Council president that  Yugoslavia and Croatia signed in Geneva on January 19 a joint  declaration aimed at normalizing ties in line with the  principles set out in the U.N. and CSCE charters.    Noting that the declaration does not imply mutual  recognition  of the two states, the Yugoslav foreign minister said that this  was, nevertheless, the ultimate goal. The document also does  not prejudge a solution for the status of the RSK, he explained.    The right of peoples to self-determination is guaranteed in  the Helsinki final act of 1975, and the Yugoslav Government does  not question that fundamental right, said Jovanovic.    The RSK, created in late 1991 by Serbs within their ethnic  and historic boundaries, was proclaimed a U.N. Protected  Territory in early 1992 in a document which set out that this  status should last until a political settlement acceptable to  both sides had been found. The fact that the RSK is a  U.N.-Protected Territory has not stopped Croatia, however, from  trying to introduce its rule there by force.</p>

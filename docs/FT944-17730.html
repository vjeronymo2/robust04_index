			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: European Court rejects German banana complaint The European Court of Justice yesterday rejected a complaint about the European Union's banana import regime after Germany claimed the rules discriminated against its traditional Latin American suppliers. Germany, which is the largest EU importer of bananas, complained to the court about the privileged access to the market enjoyed by former French and British colonies in so-called ACP - Africa, Caribbean and Pacific - countries. It claimed this discriminated against cheaper imports from Latin American suppliers. The court said Germany's reasoning was not sufficient 'to justify nullifying the market regime'. It followed advice from the advocate-general given in June last year. New rules imposed by the European Commission last year restrict Latin American banana shipments to a tariff-free quota of 2.1m tonnes a year. A deal with Latin American countries was brokered by the commission after they complained to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade about ACP countries enjoying favourable access to the EU market. Germany has already filed an additional court case about that deal with Latin American countries, claiming the commission had no authority to negotiate it. The court is expected to hear the case in about a year. Meanwhile, the commission's management committee, which supervises the banana regime, put off a decision yesterday about aid for the Windward Islands, where banana crops have been devastated by tropical storms. Geest, the food company, has called on the commission to allow it to import bananas from other sources under the ACP quota allocated to the Windward Islands to ensure that the island group does not lose market share permanently. The commission said it was still gathering information and could reach a decision in the next couple of weeks.</p>

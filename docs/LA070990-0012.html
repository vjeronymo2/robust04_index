			<p><P> July 9, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAYOR BRADLEY REVAMPS DWP  </P> <P> In reply to your June 23 article: "Moratorium Imposed on DWP Tours":  </P> <P> I commend Bradley in his attempt to make DWP an honest and responsible agency.  </P> <P> However, I must warn the mayor to keep a close eye on DWP officials, as they  are very adept at skirting agreements, moratoriums, laws, etc., After all,  they've had nearly 100 years of practice here in the Owens Valley.  </P> <P> Also, Mayor Bradley, if you think about it, its initials give us clues to its  true character. In your case, "DWP" stands for "Damn Well Please!" as the  agency has done just that for years. However, in the Owens Valley the initials  stand for "Damn Water Pirates."  </P> <P> MELINDA SALMONDS  </P> <P> Olancha  </P></p>

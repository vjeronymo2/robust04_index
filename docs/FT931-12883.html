			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Efforts to avert split on energy report MR ROBIN COOK, the shadow trade and industry spokesman, meets the energy committee of the Trades Union Congress this afternoon hoping to avert a labour movement split over the all-party report on the future of the coal industry, David Goodhart writes. Mr Roger Lyons, leader of the MSF white collar union and committee chairman, said last night that the committee hoped to 'synchronise' its position with Mr Cook. However, led by the mining unions, the committee is likely to reject the report if it reprieves only 20 of the 31 pits. Mr Lyons said yesterday: 'We do not expect 10 or 15 pits to be written off just because the government does not have an energy policy.' The rejection of such a compromise would lead to differences with most of the Labour MPs on the trade and industry committee, which is producing the coal industry report. Rejection might also be followed by calls from the National Union of Mineworkers for industrial action to save all pits. That could open up further differences between unions prepared to support a 'maximalist' position with action and the majority, which will be reluctant to do so.</p>

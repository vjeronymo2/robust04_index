			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / International Company News: OK Bazaars to be delisted after poor six months OK BAZAARS, once South Africa's leading discount department store, is to be delisted after more than 60 years on the Johannesburg stock exchange. The decision by the company's owner, South African Breweries, follows a poor half-year in which OK Bazaars ran up a bottom line loss of R40m (Dollars 12m). The move was revealed yesterday as South African Breweries, the country's largest consumer company, announced its interim results. The group overcame a difficult operating climate to record a 12 per cent increase in attributable profit to R283m in the six months to September from R252m a year ago. Mr Meyer Kahn, chairman, said that although South Africa's protracted recession appeared to have levelled out, it had seriously weakened private consumption expenditure. The group did, however, manage to increase turnover by 10 per cent to R11.3bn. Pressure on margins, however, saw trading profit rise by only 8 per cent to R971m, but lower rates of interest and taxation helped boost attributable earnings. Earnings per share rose by 11 per cent to 103 cents from 93 cents and the dividend was increased by a similar amount to 39 cents from 35 cents. Mr Kahn said the short-term prospects for the economy remained highly uncertain, with progress towards elections next April sure to be accompanied by disruption. Although not predicting growth 'of any consequence' until late-1994, the group is seeking to maintain the current level of performance for the remainder of the financial year. An indication of the severity of the recession is the fact that beer volumes fell slightly compared to the same period in 1992, a rare occurrence in the industry. Beer division profits, however, rose by 12 per cent to R207m. The group's other interests - ranging from furniture and clothing to hotels and glass - also increased their contribution by 12 per cent, to R76m (R68m). This figure, however, disguises some uneven performances. Earnings per share at Plate Glass rose by 74 per cent, while furniture company Afcol, appliances group Lion Match and clothing retailer Edgars all performed well. Furniture, footwear and clothing group Amrel, however, made increased losses.</p>

			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Markets: A creak, a groan, and a muffled sigh - London FAR AWAY, at the back of the dark, bat-infested cave that does duty as the collective memory of the London markets, you can hear a faint, ominous creak. It is instantly identifiable to anyone who has ever watched a Christopher Lee movie as the sound of a sarcophagous lid. Slowly, cautiously, it lifts. An eerie glow escapes from inside. Terrified peasants, mumbling long-forgotten prayers, cluster around the tomb. A word, a murmur passes from lip to lip . . . a name no living mortal has heard in years. Still no more than a whisper, it strikes chill to the bone: 'Barber . . . Barber . . . Barber' The spectral figure stirring at the back of the cave is not the real Lord Barber, the amiable ex-Chancellor/ex-banker, but his symbolic alter-ego, aka the Barber Boom, the rapid burst of inflationary growth in 1972-3 that followed the Heath government's U-turn away from austerity. Astonishing though it may seem - at least to anyone not brought up on a diet of late night horror movies - this spectre, long thought buried at a cross-roads with a stake through its heart, now walks the land. Or at least, it walks the densely printed pages of Ian Harnett's stock market analysis for Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull, the broker. Pondering the likely scale of the economic recovery, he and his economist colleague Corey Miller remind us that the government's leading economic indicator is at a level not seen since - yes, you guessed it, the Barber boom, when gdp growth touched 10 per cent. That is not all. Monetary policy is also exceptionally loose, if you measure it in a way which adds together the impact of laxer interest rates and a lower exchange rate. And though the Strauss Turnbull economic forecast is more optimistic than the consensus, at around 2 per cent gdp growth for 1993 and 3 per cent in 1994, this only produces a peak annualised growth rate of some 4 1/2 per cent. In practice, the economy tends to move more abruptly, both up and down, than economists predict: the peak annual rate in the 1983 recovery was 8.6 per cent; in the 1976 upturn it was 7.7 per cent. You could draw the conclusion that this recovery is likely to be more anaemic than its predecessors. Or you could conclude that there will be a burst of faster growth than economic forecasts would suggest - closely followed, perhaps, by inflation and a hasty slamming-on of the brakes, as the chancellor tries to avoid joining Lord Barber at the back of the cave. Perhaps that is what the rise in longer term interest rates was trying to tell us earlier this spring. Such worries have had little effect on the market this week. The yield on 10-year gilts was scarcely changed, closing on Friday at 8.09 per cent, up from the previous week's 8.08. The equity market has been more cheerful: the FT-SE 100 index closed at 2847.0, up 53.3. One common factor in both markets was the thought that the government's political weakness might push it into an early cut in interest rates, perhaps next Friday when the inflation rate for April is expected to fall to an annual rate of 1.5 per cent. If the short-term domestic outlook was relatively optimistic this week, the same could not be said for the international scene. Inflation worries revived in the US (though earlier in the week a strong performance by Wall Street lent added impetus to London's recovery). More important, perhaps, the economic outlook in continental Europe took another turn for the worse, with an extraordinarily steep fall in output at Mercedes Benz in the first quarter - car production was 39 per cent lower than in the same period a year ago - and fresh turmoil in the exchange rate mechanism as Spain and Portugal devalued after a day of uncertainty in the currency markets. International concerns will continue to play a role next week, when Denmark's vote on the Maastricht treaties takes place on Tuesday. In the domestic market, the big stock of the week was ICI, which carried out the trickiest part of its demerger of Zeneca, its biosciences side, on Tuesday, with the pricing of Zeneca's five-for-sixteen Pounds 1.3bn rights issue. At the rights price, the Zeneca shares yield 5.7 per cent on the forecast dividend of 27.5p for the year, an unusually juicy yield considering that the figure for the Health and Household sector as a whole is just over 3 per cent. Although the demerger does not finally take effect until June, grey market trading has already begun in the shares of the successor companies. The trend throughout the week was away from glamorous, high-flying Zeneca and towards boring old cyclical ICI, partly refecting investment sentiment in the US market. Zeneca ex-rights closed the week at 636p, down from the 682p at which it was first quoted on Tuesday and 14 per cent above the rights issue price. New-ICI closed at 622p, up from Tuesday's 569p. The existing ICI shares, enjoying their Indian spring, closed at 1263p, up 20p on the week. The other big stock of the week was BT, not so much for the scale of its redundancy costs, which lopped Pounds 1.1bn off its pre-tax profits for the year ended March, announced on Thursday, but for the Pounds 750m pension fund deficit it announced at the same time. Part of the deficit stemmed from the cost of paying off workers; but just as worrying were the other two contributors to the deficit, the impact of ACT and a much lower than expected growth in dividends received on the fund's investments. Most actuaries have been expecting a 5 per cent annual increase in dividends; in fact, dividends for the market as a whole shrank 0.1 per cent in 1992 and a further 1.8 per cent in the first quarter of 1993. One sure way of getting dividends to grow again, of course, is inflation. Which is where we, and the spectre, came in . . .</p>

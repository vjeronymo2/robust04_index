			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Producers enrolled in the options program intending to price their grain must price the grain to a licensed bonded grain dealer, grain merchant, or warehouse, or for short hedges, through a registered commodity broker. Documentation must indicate that a hedge position was taken on the grain.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1415.20&blank;Premium and Incentive Payments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The amount of incentive payments has been revised for 1994. Producers participating in the options program will receive an incentive payment of $.05 cents per bushel for both target price or price support participation. All producers will receive the incentive payments on a specific date when the options program contract expires instead of each producer receiving the incentive payment after closing out the option and pricing the grain. This change will reduce the motivation to close out the options position early just to receive the incentive payment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The total numbers of bushels that may be enrolled has been increased from 20 million bushels of corn to 60 million bushels of both corn and wheat. The expected cost of the program should remain essentially the same as the 1993 program because the reduced incentive payment will offset the increase in bushels accepted for participation. There continues to be no overall limit on bushels accepted for wheat and soybeans enrollment in the options program. Each county's share of this limit will be allocated based on the total corn and wheat CAB's in the county times the average of the percentage of such bases enrolled in the 1991 through 1993 CCC price support and production adjustment programs. If more bushels are enrolled than are allocated to a county, a drawing will be held to determine participants within a county.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=3 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> G. 7 CFR Part 1416, Voluntary Production Limitation Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The 1990 Act amended the 1949 Act to provide that, effective for the 1993 through 1995 crops of wheat and feed grains, if an ARP or a land diversion program is announced for such crops, the Secretary may conduct a pilot program in at least 15 counties in at least two States where producers have expressed an interest in participating in the pilot program. Under this program, producers on a farm shall be considered to have met the requirements of an ARP or land diversion program if such producers meet the requirements of the VPLP. After concurrence with the authors of the legislation, it was determined that the program would not be implemented until the 1994 crop year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Producers who elect to participate in the VPLP for wheat and/or feed grains shall enter into a agreement which provides that the producer shall comply with the program by: (1) Not planting wheat or feed grain crops exceeding the sum of the CAB's enrolled in the VPLP; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

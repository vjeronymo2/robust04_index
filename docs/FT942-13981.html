			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Labour to exploit concern on hospitals The Labour party yesterday moved to exploit the government's growing discomfort over its plans for large-scale closures of London hospitals. Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, has chosen the programme to merge or shut some of the capital's leading teaching hospitals as the subject of a full-scale Commons debate next Thursday. The aim is to maximise the growing political backlash against the plans on the eve of the May 5 local elections. The debate follows the establishment of an all-party group of backbench MPs to oppose the decision by Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, to shut departments at Guy's hospital through a merger with St Thomas's. Mr Roger Sims, Conservative MP for Chislehurst in Kent, has joined a campaign launched by Mr Simon Hughes, the Liberal Democrat MP for Bermondsey, to raise Pounds 1m to oppose the effective closure of Guy's. Labour is also opposing the plan. Growing concern on the Tory back benches about the wisdom of the decision has been fuelled by new figures undermining Mrs Bottomley's case for rationalisation. Sir Rhodes Boyson, a former health minister, and Mr Matthew Carrington, MP for Fulham, are among Tory MPs calling for a reassessment.</p>

			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Tendering threshold set for councils SMALL councils need not put white-collar services out to tender where the scale of the activity is below a certain level, the government said yesterday, Alison Smith writes. Mr David Curry, the local government minister, said that the de minimis threshold could be based on the value of a particular service, on the number of staff employed in performing it, or a combination of the two factors. Tendering for the first tranche of white-collar services - those related to construction - is due to begin in late spring next year. The decision to set a threshold would not prevent councils from putting such services out to tender if they wanted to, but would mean that they were not required to incur the costs of the tendering process if they thought the likely benefit too small.</p>

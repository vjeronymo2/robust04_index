			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Wholesale electricity prices rise 23% PRICES IN the wholesale electricity market for England and Wales were 23 per cent higher in the first half of the year than in the same period last year, an analysis published yesterday by the consultancy group Caminus Energy shows, Michael Smith writes. The findings will fuel demands from heavy electricity consumers for Offer, the electricity regulator, to take action to stem the price rises. Offer is already considering whether to refer National Power and PowerGen, the generators, to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission over their role in the increases. Caminus found that uplift payments that are levied to pay for the administration of the market, called the pool, rose by 80 per cent in the first half. The average pool selling price was Pounds 28.50 per MWh between January and June.</p>

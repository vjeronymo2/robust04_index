			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / International Company News: Alumax to build Dollars 75m parts plant Alumax, the third-largest US aluminium producer, is to build a Dollars 75m plant on an 82-acre site at Jackson, Tennessee, to produce car parts using its proprietary semi-solid metal forming, or SSF, technology. The move underlines the aluminium industry's belief that it expects increased demand from the automotive industry. SSF is claimed to be the first new metal forming process for decades. The Alumax technology, covered by more than 60 patents, involves specially-processed aluminium billets forged into high-quality components with one stroke. Alumax says the components have virtually all the detail of the finished part and need little, if any, further processing. Chrysler and Ford in the US have been testing engine and air conditioning components made by the process for two years. Mr Alan Born, Alumax chairman, said the new plant, to be completed in two years would eventually employ 500 people. Mr Bond Evans, president, said at Alumax's annual meeting that the aluminium industry had seen the bottom of the economic cycle and the worst of the problems associated with the break-up of the Soviet Union.</p>

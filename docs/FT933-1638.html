			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Juggling with gelignite in farm trade forum - David Marsh and Lionel Barber on the risky search for a US-French compromise on Blair House EFFORTS to find a compromise between the US and France over farm trade are fraught with even greater complexity and risk than last year's EC attempts to reverse Denmark's rejection of the Maastricht treaty. Politicians said that solving the Danish puzzle was like 'multi-dimensional chess'. Finding a way out of the farm impasse is like chess and juggling with gelignite. In the Maastricht negotiations the EC found a face-saving deal to meet Denmark's demand for exemptions from European union, without causing the entire treaty to be renegotiated. In the bid to bridge the agricultural gap between Washington and Paris, US and EC officials face a still more arduous task. They have to deliver an agreement which meets the US desire to avoid reopening the EC-US Blair House farm trade accord reached last November. But they must also fulfil the Paris government's aim of modifying the accord's undertaking for a 21 per cent cut in the volume of subsidised EC food exports over six years. Unless the imbroglio can be solved, hopes for clinching a Uruguay Round accord by the December 15 dealine will crumble - bringing closer the prospect of an international trade war. All participants in the negotiations realise that some of the chief protagonists' recent hard-line announcements, including the sparring this week in Brussels, involve a degree of posturing. The difficulty is knowing whether, and where, the US and French sides will show a willingness to make concessions. One insider to the talks said yesterday that a statement on Tuesday by Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, ruling out modifications to Blair House, was predictable. Mr Kantor, who meets Sir Leon Brittan, the EC's chief trade negotiator, in Washington on Monday, would not reveal his full hand until later, the official said. 'They're keeping it for the end-game,' he added. 'We don't know yet the French bottom line. We have a lot of teasing out to do.' On Monday night in Brussels, Sir Leon staved off French efforts to change his negotiating mandate with Mr Kantor. But this was at the expense of a row with Mr Alain Juppe, the French foreign minister, and rekindled French fears that the UK commissioner is a free-trader who is too close to the UK and US. German officials spent much of Monday night's meeting trying to mediate between the French and their EC partners. But one German official yesterday voiced concerns that Sir Leon's confrontation could affect French attitudes toward the final Gatt settlement, which requires unanimous approval by the EC. 'He (Sir Leon) was good,' said one senior German official yesterday, 'but maybe he was too good.' On the other hand, if Sir Leon can successfully promote a US-French deal the prospect - at present, rather thin - of pulling off his ambition to succeed Mr Jacques Delors as the next EC Commission president would improve dramatically. The apparent gulf between US and French attitudes has been increased by intensely political considerations. The US seems fundamentally to mistrust the content of EC Common Agricultural Policy reforms, designed to cut prices and production during the 1990s. And after France's monetary humiliation last month at the hands of the German Bundesbank and Anglo-Saxon 'speculators', Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, badly wants to avoid the spectacle of a climb-down to US farming interests. Experts believe there is the possibility, in some important technical areas, of adding to the Blair House agreement a series of points to meet France's desire to protect its interests. For instance, the US could clarify whether EC food stocks should be considered part of the accord's export cuts, and could also agree a 'peace clause' ruling out unilateral action against the EC's farm export regime. Since the US already feels the EC got the better of the Blair House compromise, room for manoeuvre is constrained. The next few weeks will show whether there is enough left for all sides in the farm trade conundrum to declare themselves - however implausibly - the winners.</p>

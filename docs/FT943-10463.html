			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Bid talk returns to Wellcome Shock news of an unsolicited bid in the pharmaceuticals sector sent shares in several leading UK groups, particularly Wellcome, up sharply as investors scouted around for the next candidate. The Dollars 8.5bn bid from US drugs group American Home Products for American Cyanamid is the first unsolicited takeover attempt since Roche launched an attack on Sterling six years ago. It reminded pharmaceuticals analysts of a piece of research produced by Wertheim Schroder just over a month ago. In that research Dr Jonathan Gelles suggested that Wellcome was a candidate for takeover or merger and in that event would be worth around 900p a share. Dr Gelles reiterated his belief yesterday: 'I do not think by any means that 900p is an outrageous figure. I believe we will see at least Dollars 40bn of mergers in the industry in the next six to 18 months.' Wellcome shares, which were still benefiting from rejection of a rival's product by the US Food and Drug Administration a few days ago, jumped 17 to 676p. Also, Zeneca, which currently has a share value of just above Pounds 7bn, strengthened 13 to 771p.</p>

			<p><P> July 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Hydraulic system failures affected landings by two American Airlines jets, a  DC-10 carrying 297 people to Dallas and a Boeing 727 carrying 34 passengers and  crew members to Rochester, N.Y. Backup systems took over in both cases and no  injuries were reported, officials said. Airport emergency personnel and the  Rochester Fire Department lined the runway as the 727 touched down at Greater  Rochester International Airport. American Airlines spokesman James Brown said  one of three hydraulic systems of the plane failed en route from the  Raleigh-Durham, N.C., airport and the crew was forced to use a backup hydraulic  system to lower the landing gear. The plane had to be towed from the end of the  runway to the terminal. Flight 154 en route from San Francisco with 284  passengers and a crew of 13 experienced a failure in the primary hydraulic  system controlling the landing gear after landing at Dallas-Ft. Worth  International Airport. The pilot reported trouble steering the craft while  taxiing and the DC-10 was also towed to the gate.  </P></p>

			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Asthma epidemic sparks government inquiry The government is to launch an inquiry into last month's unprecedented outbreak of asthma attacks, it said yesterday. Department of Health officials will this week begin writing to all health authorities in England requesting information on patients who suffered acute asthma attacks on June 24 following violent thunderstorms. The move follows reports by hospitals, particularly in London and the south-east, of large numbers of people attending accident and emergency units in the 12-hour period after the storms. More than 3m people in the UK have asthma, including one in every seven children, and 2,000 die from it each year. Hospitals expect on average to treat between two and eight asthma-attack victims a day. However, following the thunderstorms several reported that up to 100 people had come in for treatment. Experts believe these victims could represent just a small percentage of the number affected. Dr Martyn Partridge, chief medical adviser to the National Asthma Campaign and consultant at Whipps Cross Hospital, London, where more than 50 people sought treatment, said yesterday: 'The numbers of people who actually came in for treatment is just the tip of the iceberg. Normal asthma sufferers probably just stayed at home and waited to see their doctor.' Air pollution caused by car exhausts is thought to be at least partly responsible for the epidemic and the DoH said it would be asking health authorities for their views on the causes. 'The letter will ask for a wide-ranging amount of information,' it said yesterday. 'Officials will want an idea of the level of people who experienced problems, their symptoms, and any noticeable clusters of areas worst affected.' The inquiry may later include Scotland and Wales. The DoH was unable to confirm whether this was the first time such an inquiry had been carried out into asthma attacks. It said similar information was requested earlier this year after public concern over Streptococcus A, the so-called 'killer bug'. Several other official inquiries are being undertaken into the impact of the environment on public health. A consultation paper published earlier this year by the departments of environment and transport suggested proposals for limiting pollution, including allowing local authorities to reduce vehicle access in certain areas. There is no evidence to suggest that the asthma epidemic continued after June 24 although experts say there is a long-term upward trend in the number of asthma sufferers.</p>

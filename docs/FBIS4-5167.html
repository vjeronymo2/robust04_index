			<p>BFN     [Text] A decision of the DPRK Supreme People's Assembly  [SPA] on the successful fulfillment of the task of socialist  economic construction in the period of adjustment set forth by  the Workers' Party of Korea [WPK] was adopted at the session  with the unanimous approval of the deputies. The decision of  the DPRK SPA adopted at the session is as follows.    The decision of the DPRK SPA on the successful fulfillment  of  the tasks of socialist economic construction in the period of  adjustment:    The 21st plenary session of the Sixth WPK Central Committee  has set 1994 through 1996 as a period of adjustment for the  socialist economic construction and has put forward a strategic  task to be fulfilled during that period.    The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: In the  socialist economic construction, we should set the upcoming  three years as a period of adjustment as decided by the 21st  plenary session of the Sixth Party Central Committee and  thoroughly implement the agriculture-first policy, light  industry-first policy, and trade-first policy during that  period. Along with this, we should firmly give priority to the  coal industry, power industry, and railway transport--which are  the leading sectors of the national economy--and should continue  to develop the metal industry.    The task of socialist economic construction in the period of  adjustment is to thoroughly implement the agriculture-first  policy, light industry-first policy, and trade-first policy; to  firmly give priority to the coal industry, the power industry,  and railway transport; and to continue developing the metal  industry.    The WPK's presentation of the task of socialist economic  construction in the period of adjustment is a wise step,  enabling our socialist construction to be further deepened and  developed at a new higher level, while consolidating the success  gained during implementation of the Third Seven-Year Plan.    The WPK's revolutionary economic strategy is to totally  comply with the basic interest of our revolution and  construction, as well as to correctly reflect the aspirations  and demands of our people. Also, the strategy is a just policy,  which makes it possible to significantly raise our people's  standard of living to extraordinarily strengthen our country's  independence and the might of the socialist economy in  conformity with the demands of socialism.    Only when the revolutionary economic strategy is embodied,  will the long-cherished desire of our people to eat rice and  meat soup, wear silk clothes, and live in a tile-roofed house be  brilliantly achieved within the near future. At the same time,  the country's self-reliant economic foundation will be  consolidated as firm as a rock and a firm prospect to occupy a  higher hill of socialism will be opened.    The DPRK SPA will decide as follows to successfully fulfill  the tasks of the socialist economic construction in the period  of adjustment put forward by the WPK.    1. The DPRK SPA will thoroughly implement the  agriculture-first, light industry-first, and trade-first policy.  Thoroughly implementing the agriculture-first policy, light  industry-first policy, and trade-first policy is a basic  guarantee for significantly raising the people's standard of  living in the demands of socialism. It will effect the  industrialization and modernization of agriculture at a higher  level by thoroughly implementing the agriculture-first policy.  Also, it will satisfactorily solve the issue concerning the  people's food [inmindului mongnunmunjelul wonmanhui haegyol  halgosida] by more greatly increasing all agricultural products,  including grain production.    It will greatly develop the country's irrigation system by  repairing and reinforcing irrigation facilities and by more  effectively adopting the irrigation method [kwansu pangbop],  while consolidating the success made in irrigation and  electrification [surihwawa chongihwaui songgwa]. It will  satisfactorily meet the demands of electricity by repairing and  newly establishing power supply facilities and by improving the  power supply system.    It will raise the utilization rate of the existing  agricultural tools in the rural communities to the maximum and  newly produce and supply various agricultural tools, including  more than 30,000 tractors and 10,000 cargo trucks. Also, it  will produce various kinds of chemical fertilizer and  agricultural chemicals. As a result, it will raise the  comprehensive mechanization and chemicalization in the national  economy to a higher level.    Crops of rice and corn per chongbo [one chongbo equals  2.45 acres] will be further increased by thoroughly implementing  the demands of rural technological revolution and chuche-based  farming method so that the grain production target of 15 million  tonnes may be achieved in the coming years.    All domains of rural economy, including livestock, fruit  cultivation, and sericultural sectors will be developed so that  demands for meat, fruit, and vegetable and raw agricultural  products demanded by industries can be satisfactorily guaranteed.    Innovations in the production of people's consumer goods  will  be accelerated through the development of light industry.    Textile factories will be repaired, reinforced, and  modernized so that fabric production can be increased by over 20  percent during the period of adjustment. Knitting and  clothes-processing industries will be developed so that various  kinds of clothes suitable for our people's figure and socialist  lifestyle can be produced in large volumes.    The shoe industry will be modernized and production capacity  will be utilized reasonably to increase shoe production by over  10 percent during the period of adjustment, thus, people's  diverse demand for shoes will be satisfactorily guaranteed.    The food industry will be developed and production of  popular  foods will be increased to enrich and diversify people's dietary  life. The volume and kinds of daily necessities will be  increased and their quality will be further improved.    Local industry will be developed by modernizing local  industry plants and reinforcing local resource bases.  Production of various quality daily necessities and food will  be significantly increased by reinforcing the production of 3  August people's consumer goods in all domains of people's  economy including plants, enterprises, and cottage industry  cooperatives and units.    Various areas of the people's economy will sufficiently  produce and guarantee various raw materials for light industry,  including chemical textiles and plastic.    A new turn will be made in foreign trade in conformity with  the changing circumstance. All areas of people's economy will  actively mobilize export resources, reinforce export bases,  actively increase production, and improve the quality of export  items of large foreign demand, including steel material,  nonferrous metal, machinery equipment, batteries, magnesia  clinkers, cement, processed stone, silk products, and  traditional Koryo medicine.    Overseas markets will be actively developed, credit will be  earned, and external trading transactions will be expanded and  developed in various forms and methods, including processing  trade, reselling trade [toegori muyok], commission trade, joint  venture and management, economic and technological  collaboration, and overseas construction.    Investment conditions for foreign companies will be  satisfactorily guaranteed and investment inducement activities  will be promoted by strengthening management in the Najin and  Sonbong free economic trade zones.    2. Coal and electricity industries, and railway  transportation, which are the leading sectors of the people's  economy, will be assured that they are given priority, and the  development of metal industry will be continued.    Continuously developing the metal industry and assuring that  priority is given to the leading sectors of the people's economy  are important demands for expanding and developing agriculture,  light industry, and foreign trade, and for strengthening the  self-reliance and independence of economy.    Coal production will be increased by 30 percent during the  period of adjustment with the strengthening of the coal industry  by giving precedence in tunneling and removal of soil and rocks,  modernizing mining and transportation equipment, accelerating  construction of new mines and new pits, carrying out  construction work ahead of schedule, and giving priority to  providing materials and equipment.    Investment in the crude oil industry will be increased so  that more oil fields can be discovered by using reinforced  exploring facilities and equipment, and by focusing efforts on  exploring potential areas.    In the electricity industry, electricity production will  be increased by 30 percent during the period of adjustment by  repairing and reinforcing power plants, improving technological  management, and accelerating power plant construction.  Thermoelectric power plants will be in full operation through  sufficiently supplied coal, hydroelectric power plants will  increase the efficiency of water pressure, and factory  thermoelectric power plants and small-to-medium hydroelectric  power plants will normalize electricity production.    The construction of large-scale power plants will be  actively  accelerated so that they can begin operation ahead of schedule.  An increased number of power plants using waste heat,  small-to-medium hydroelectric power plants, and wind-power  generating stations will be built, and nuclear power plants will  be built on a large scale.    Daily railway cargo transportation will be increased by over  30 percent by strengthening the material and technological basis  of railway transportation and organizing transportation  organizations and command. Main lines will focus on railways,  more trains and engines will be manufactured, and transportation  organizations and command will be modernized and will be more  scientific.    In the metal industry, priority will be guaranteed for iron  ore production by reinforcing the tunneling and mining capacity  of metal mines, including the Musan mining complex. The  production of steel materials will be further increased by  repairing and reinforcing the production procedure of iron and  steel stations with modern technology.    3. Economic organizational works will continue to be  properly  carried out and economic management will be carried out well.  Properly carrying out economic organizational works and economic  management is a prerequisite for successfully implementing the  tasks of socialist economic construction in the period of  adjustment by highly displaying the revolutionary enthusiasm and  active creativity of the masses.    In conformity with the demands of the party's revolutionary  economic strategy, the State Administration Council will improve  economic operations and organizational works, and further grip,  guide, and control all sectors and units of economic society.    On the basis of the firm guarantee of the state's unified  guidance on economic works, the creativity of committees,  ministries, and provincial, municipal, and county plants and  enterprises will be highly displayed. Particularly, provinces,  cities, and counties will do their utmost to produce and  guarantee people's consumer goods on their own by mobilizing  local resources and reserves to the maximum.    The people's economic plan will be practically drawn up  under  the principle of making everything obedient to implementing  revolutionary economic strategy. All areas and units will  implement without fail the daily, monthly, quarterly, and  indexical national plan.    Material and equipment will be provided to agriculture,  light  industry, and export production with priority by properly  carrying out material supply works. The all-people support  movement to these sectors will be vigorously carried out.    Along with this, the material and equipment for the leading  sectors of the people's economy and metal industry will be  thoroughly guaranteed.    In conformity with the demands of the Taean work system, the  management of labor, equipment, and material will be improved,  economic assets will be properly maintained, the economic  efficiency of production and management activities will be  maximized, economic leverages such as cost, price, profit will  be properly utilized, the independent accounting system will be  correctly implemented, and control by won [Korean currency] will  be intensified.    By vigorously carrying out the movement for production  increase and conservation as an all-mass movement, we should  discover all reserves for production increase and should  actively save raw materials and materials including electricity,  coal, and fuel, thus thoroughly eliminating various phenomena of  wastefulness.    We will see to it that valuable scientific and technological  inventions, technical innovation plans, creative designs, and  rationalization plans be worked out by inspiring the patriotic  passion and abilities of the producing masses, scientists, and  technicians so that they are effectively used in production.    4. We will further strengthen the single-hearted unity of  the revolutionary ranks and will highly display the  revolutionary spirit of self-reliance.    It is a decisive guarantee for successfully implementing the  tasks of the period of adjustment of socialist economic  construction that all the people highly demonstrate the  revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and arduous struggle in  firm unity with the party and the leader.    We will see to it that all functionaries and workers firmly  arm themselves with the chuche revolutionary outlook and  vigorously display the might of single-hearted unity of our  revolutionary ranks in implementing tasks of the period of  adjustment in firm unity with the party and the leader.    All domains and all units of the national economy, upholding  the militant slogan, "Let us vigorously accelerate the socialist  general march with the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and  arduous struggle!" will effect a new upsurge in socialist  economic construction by discovering what is in shortage and by  producing what is not available and by assuming the attitude and  position worthy of masters to carry out works with their own  strength even without help from the upper echelon, although such  help is better than none.    All economic guidance functionaries and workers will break  through difficulties laid before them by their own strength with  such spirit as one with which our working class and people  produced hand-grenades with empty hands during the arduous days  of war; restored the economy on the empty land after the war,  and effected the great Chollima upsurge. They will successfully  carry to accomplishment the tasks of the period of adjustment of  socialist economic construction by continually innovating and  advancing with the spirit of adding the speed of the nineties to  Chollima.    5. We will further enhance the responsibility and role of  guiding functionaries of the state economic organizations.    Successful implementation of tasks of the period of  adjustment of socialist economic construction depends on the  sense of responsibility and role of the state economic guiding  functionaries, who are the commanding staff of the revolution.    The state economic guiding functionaries should cherish  thoroughgoing faith and determination to entrust their destinies  to our party and to die at the post of duty while defending  their revolutionary outposts, and should become the  standard-bearers and vanguards in upholding the party and the  leader.    Through practical struggle to successfully implement the  tasks of the period of adjustment of socialist economic  construction, the guiding functionaries will highly display the  sense of loyalty to the party and the leader.    With a sense of confidence and optimism that they will win  victory without fail on the road of upholding the leadership of  the great leader and great party, the guiding functionaries will  always think creatively, will boldly and revolutionarily carry  out works, will stand at the van of difficult tasks, and will  fulfill their responsibility and role assigned by the party and  the leader by fully demonstrating all of their wisdom and  passion.    The guiding functionaries will deeply mingle with the  producer masses according to the demand of the revolutionary  slogan, "We serve the people!" and should share joy and sorrow  with them. Thus, they will skillfully organize and mobilize the  masses to the implementation of the tasks of the period of  adjustment.    6. The establishment of concrete execution measures for  these decisions will be entrusted to the DPRK Administration  Council.

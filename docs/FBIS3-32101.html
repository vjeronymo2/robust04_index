			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Over 8,000 gallons of fuel are currently stored at  the UN/OAS mission garage in Delmas. When interviewed by Signal  FM on 31 January, Eric Falt, the UN spokesman in Haiti, said  this fuel is not humanitarian fuel but rather the mission's  reserve.    Asked where this fuel comes from and where it is stored,  Falt  said the administrative and garage service controls the storage  of such products. He explained that the UN mission does not have  any particular facility to be supplied with fuel. Falt (?denied)  any connection between this operation and the arrival in  Port-au-Prince last week of approximately 30 members of the UN  mission. This is not a redeployment of the mission in Haiti, he  stated.</p>

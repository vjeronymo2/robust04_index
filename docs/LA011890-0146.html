			<p><P> January 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AT&amp;T BREAKDOWN COULD FUEL BATTLE FOR MARKET SHARE  </P> <P> In recent months, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph has tweaked its  competitors with a series of ads showing rivals' foul-ups in long-distance  services. One ad shows an annoyed man sitting at his desk throwing cards on the  floor while waiting for an AT&amp;T competitor to make a long-distance  connection. In another, a caller trying to dial Philadelphia finds himself  talking to someone in Fiji.  </P> <P> The ads stress AT&amp;T's long record of reliability and imply that those  problems are what happen when you put your fate in the hands of young upstarts.  </P> <P> But AT&amp;T's long-distance breakdown on Monday -- its worst system failure  ever -- makes it look like the bad guy that makes customers wait to reach  Philadelphia. Analysts wondered how much more market share Ma Bell may lose to  its charged-up rivals, noting that the breakdown will force many customers to  seek linkups with backup carriers as a sort of insurance policy.  </P> <P> The debacle couldn't have come at a worse time for AT&amp;T, which controls  about two-thirds of the nation's long-distance market. Its aggressive ads and  stepped-up marketing in recent months had succeeded in significantly slowing  the loss of market share to a slew of smaller competitors, analysts said.  </P> <P> A much humbled AT&amp;T spent the last two days apologizing and promising some  token to soothe ill feelings -- about which it will announce specific plans  today. The company had said it would seek permission from the Federal  Communications Commission to offer a day of discounted long-distance services,  but sources said Wednesday that AT&amp;T was considering seeking permission to  expand the discounts beyond one day.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, major competitors were pondering how hard they should kick the giant  while it's down.  </P> <P> "We've been handed an opportunity," said Michael J. Furtney, director of  corporate relations for US Sprint, which ran ads after Hurricane Hugo and the  Bay Area earthquake capitalizing on some problems AT&amp;T had with broken  lines and extremely heavy volume. This time, Sprint doesn't have to stretch  itself too much to respond, Furtney said. "All we have to do is raise our hand  and say there is another alternative," he added.  </P> <P> MCI Communications said it had no plans to change its marketing. "We're already  pretty aggressive," said company spokesman Bernard Goodrich.  </P> <P> Analysts said the major benefit for AT&amp;T's competitors is that the massive  breakdown makes a compelling argument that no major business should depend on  one long-distance company. "They can make the case that it is like having only  one bridge into the city," said Gregory Sawyers, an analyst with Sanford C.  Bernstein &amp; Co. in New York. Many companies are already using more than one  service, he said. "This will accelerate the process," he said.  </P> <P> Some analysts said AT&amp;T's competitors should be cautious in how far they go  in attacking AT&amp;T. If they make too much of the technical breakdown, "they  could be setting themselves up," said David J. Boczar, an analyst with New  Japan Securities in New York. "It could happen to them," he said.  </P> <P> The breakdown is by no means a fatal blow for AT&amp;T, analysts said. But it  knocks the wind out of AT&amp;T's boasts of technical superiority, they added.  "What this may point out is that AT&amp;T has some of the same hardware and  software problems as everybody else," said Steven Kropper, program manager for  International Data Corp., a technology market research firm.  </P> <P> While AT&amp;T may suffer short term, many analysts said the damage will be  mitigated by two factors. "The key item to make note of is that AT&amp;T has a  very strong track record," said Paul Aran, an analyst with Bear, Stearns &amp;  Co. in New York.  </P> <P> Additionally, AT&amp;T's management didn't falter in the crisis. "I think they  responded very well. They acknowledged the mistake, apologized and promise to  try to make it up," Sawyers said.  </P> <P> Analysts said AT&amp;T's quick offer to provide restitution demonstrates a new  level of aggressiveness at the company. For a time, AT&amp;T was not adverse to  losing some market share, reasoning that it would stem tighter government  regulation of the company, Boczar said.  </P> <P> "I think they feel comfortable with the current market share" and have moved  aggressively to prevent erosion, he said.  </P> <P> AT&amp;T spokesman Walter Murphy said the company is reassessing specific ads,  but any changes "will have no bearing" on the basic message of AT&amp;T's  reliability.  </P></p>

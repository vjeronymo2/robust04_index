			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Books: Full pelt through Armenia THE CROSSING PLACE: A JOURNEY AMONG THE ARMENIANS by Philip Marsden HarperCollins Pounds 16.99, 250 pages A young writer walking in eastern Anatolia stumbled on a piece of bone which, so a nonchalant shepherd told him, was human. Thus began Philip Marsden's voyage round the Armenian diaspora. When he reached the desert town of Ras ul-Ain in northern Syria, however, the place where thousands of Armenians were corralled and massacred in 1915-6, he found nothing, felt nothing. 'I had thought that seeing the places might make it easier to understand. It hadn't; it had made it harder.' Here is an observant writer armed with a rich theme: the long aftermath of the Turkish genocide whose details were for years suppressed by perpetrators and victims alike. Marsden writes vividly, sometimes sublimely (there is a river whose 'bulbous eddies twist and spin', an old cobbler whose fingers are 'long and arthritic and bent sideways like the bristles of an old brush.') If he does not in the end succeed in illuminating either the story or the character of the Armenians, that, I suggest, is because his method stands in the way of his purpose. For it is a hectic, insistently first-person narrative. There are numberless encounters and endless details of a six-month journey through 20 contiguous countries which leave the reader tired and out of breath. One longs for the author to sit still and reflect; for then his eyes are sharpest, his objects clearest and his writing at its least self-conscious. Marsden is a writer who could be in the Leigh Fermor mould were he to play to his literary rather than reportorial strengths. As things are, every character and incident gets equal treatment and a breakneck story peters out inconclusively with sporadic gunfire at night on a hillside above the Armenian-Iranian border. The result is a travel book, or a book about a research trip, but never quite what one had hoped for: a portrait of an extraordinary race. On the boat to Cyprus early in his journey, Marsden met a Jewish antique-dealer who asked him what he was doing. 'I'm on my way to Armenia'. 'Armenia? What are you going to find there?' 'I have no idea'. Unfortunately, Marsden spoke more truly than he knew.</p>

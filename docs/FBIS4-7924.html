			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, April 8 (BTA) -- In March the monthly  inflation rate was 7.5 percent -- the highest since May 1992,  said Prof. Zakhari Karamfilov, chairman of the National  Statistical Institute [NSI] at a press conference today. In  1993 inflation ranged between 1.9 percent (in June) and 6.9  percent (in January). This year the monthly inflation rate  climb persisted from 3.8 percent in January and 4.6 percent in  February to 7.5 percent in March. Total inflation for the first  three months was 16.6 percent, which exceeds the 10 percent  projected by the National Statistical Institute (NSI).  According to Prof. Karamfilov it is still early to project the  annual inflation rate, but he believes that the data for April  will be indicative in this respect.    In March consumer prices went up by 8 percent, marking a  17.2  percent increase from December last year. The steepest rise was  registered in the prices of fresh fruit -- 74 percent, followed  by confectionery -- 20 percent, vegetables -- 9.9 percent,  coffee -- 8.7 percent, and cigarettes -- 23.7 percent. At the  same time non- foods went up by 9 percent in March and 18.8  percent in the first quarter of the year. However, these  figures are based on data received by March 22, 1994, and do not  reflect the surge in prices in the last ten days of March.    That is why the NSI conducted an express survey of the  prices  of 24 foods and 3 non-foods by March 31. The survey covered  staple foods and commodities, the prices of which are bound to  the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar. The aggregate increase in  prices for March was 61.5 percent [figure as received],  according to the data of the survey. The price of oranges  soared almost two-fold -- 95.8 percent, coffee went up by 69.7  percent, sugar by 42.7 percent, yellow cheese 36.3 percent,  white cheese 33 percent, bananas 20.2 percent, and lemons 13.9  percent.    The prices of monitored non-foods nearly doubled. Cookers  identified the most dramatic rise, going up 2.5 times, followed  by automatic washing machines with 2.2 times, colour TV sets 2.1  times, refrigerators 2 times, and vacuum cleaners with 98.4  percent. These are mostly imported commodities and the rise of  their prices was an immediate result of the dollar appreciation  on the forex market.    The prices set in the different regions of the country vary  within a wide range. Pork, for example, moves from 45 to 104  leva, beef from 54 to 92 leva, chicken from 45 to 70 leva, some  sausages from 54 to 92 leva, sheep's cheese from 70 to 144 leva  and coffee from 160 to 310 leva. This trend holds true for  non-foods just as well.    Another characteristic feature of the current market  situation is the wide margin between producer and market prices.  According to Prof. Karamfilov, all this comes to show that  while the foreign exchange rates fluctuation pushed the  inflation rate up, the speculative price growth is a no less  powerful inflationary factor. The major factor that brought  about the current price jump is the lack of government price  policy and the launching of price decontrol before the  liquidation of the monopoly state structures, according to the  head of the NSI.</p>

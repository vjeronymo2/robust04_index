			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / FT Exporter (4): Regional blocks strengthening - Changes in tariffs and quotas promised by Gatt, Nafta and the EC are pushing the industry towards closer regional ties / Textiles THE business of selling clothing and textiles in foreign countries is a more uncertain enterprise than it has been for many years. A labyrinthine world of tariffs and quotas is likely to be changed radically by three factors: the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) and closer economic links between EC member states and countries in eastern Europe and north Africa that are tempting manufacturers to invest there. They promise to transform the existing trading environment into one based more heavily on regional trading blocks of Asia, the Americas and Europe/north Africa. The existing structure consists of Asian manufacturers selling to western and Japanese consumers, with sales limited largely by quotas and tariffs designed to protect jobs in customer countries. The complexity of these rules should not be underestimated. The existing Multi Fibre Arrangement (MFA), which a new Gatt may replace, is a set of bilaterally negotiated trade quotas with explicit limits on, for example, the number of knitted underwear pieces that can be exported from Hong Kong to the UK. In parallel with the MFA, individual countries impose import tariffs. Since textiles is a fragmented industry, the various lobbying forces have succeeded in creating several layers of tariffs: the US, for example, levies five different tariffs, according to such criteria as whether the goods being imported are narrow or wide fabrics, rabbit hair yarn or yarn made from other materials. Tariffs can be percentages of the value of goods, fixed increments or a mixture of both. What the draft Gatt agreement proposes is a phasing out of MFA quotas and a reduction of tariffs. This would take place over more than a decade with the changes weighted towards the second half of that period. Paradoxically, the elimination of quotas could benefit European companies, says Kurt Salmon Associates, the textile industry consultancy. It argues that European markets are already saturated with cheap clothing from low cost suppliers, mainly in Asian countries. 'Growth will therefore come from higher quality products at higher prices,' it says. For US companies, however, and European companies exporting to the US, life may become more difficult. As well as the elimination of MFA quotas, they face the challenge of a tariff-free border with Mexico under Nafta. US companies are particularly vulnerable since they are more protected than their European counterparts: Gatt estimates suggest that protection for clothing may now be costing a family of four up to Dollars 420 a year in the US, Dollars 220 a year in Canada and Dollars 130 a year in the UK. The US textiles and clothing industry is split over its support for Nafta. The American Textile Manufacturers Institute, the industry's trade body, is in favour of Nafta. It argues that new markets will be opened and that imports from low-wage Mexico will displace those from the Far East. But the anti-Nafta lobby is gaining support. Led by Roger Milliken, president of Milliken &amp; Co, one of America's most profitable textile manufacturers, it argues that the flow of textile and clothing jobs to Mexico would only accelerate as a result of Nafta. There are nevertheless some parallels between Europe and the US because low wage countries such as Morocco and Poland are winning special trade deals with the European Community. Although these deals fall short of the Single Market structure envisaged in Nafta, they will still affect clothing and textile trading patterns. A recent market study by consultancy David Rigby Associates took as a working assumption that half the volume of garments currently imported into the EC from south and east Asia will eventually be sourced from eastern Europe and North Africa. This change would increase the role of outward processing in which EC companies cut EC produced cloth, send it to a non-EC country for assembly into garments and bring it back for finishing. This allows them to sell the garment as Made in an EC country and take advantage of the Single Market. Outward processing is popular in Germany, because of its proximity to eastern Europe. In the old days, German companies did their outward processing in what was East Germany. Today Poland, the Czech Republic and Romania are the big suppliers. Outward processing is still a new phenomenon for France and the UK but investment is already growing in North Africa. Finally, the lower wage Asian countries, especially in south-east Asia and China are becoming suppliers to the likes of Japan and South Korea as well as their traditional customers in the west. The response of Japanese companies, for example, has been to become more like their western counterparts, closing domestic plants and building new ones in nearby countries. These changes appear to point to a drift of manufacturing towards Mexico and the fringes of the EC at the expense of Asian countries. There may yet be some way to go before a single global market is achieved as Gatt perhaps envisages. But the combination of Gatt, Nafta and the EC seems to be pushing trade in clothing and textiles to ever larger regional blocks.</p>

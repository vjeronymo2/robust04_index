			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / International Company News: Minorco shake-up continues as another chief resigns ANOTHER SENIOR executive has suddenly quit Minorco, the Luxembourg-based overseas investment arm of the Anglo American Corporation of South Africa. Mr Geoff Mortimer, 49, was recruited two years ago as managing director of Minorco's industrial minerals division after the company paid Dollars 108m for the Elbekies sand and gravel business near Berlin in former east Germany. His departure follows Minorco's top-level shake-up in December. Then, Mr Roger Phillimore, a joint managing director, left, having lost a contest for the chief executive's role to Mr Hank Slack. Minorco made no mention of the departure of Mr Mortimer, formerly managing director of ARC's UK aggregates operations, when it released its half-year results yesterday. These revealed a sharp jump in operating earnings from the industrial minerals business - from Dollars 0.3m to Dollars 23m in the six months to December 31. Minorco said Mr Mortimer had 'gone back to consulting. We are very sad to see him go.' He will be replaced by another former ARC executive, Mr John Draper. Minorco reported that its financial income, plus earnings from equity-accounted investments, more than offset its operating losses in the half-year to December 31. Earnings before extraordinary items were USDollars 101.4m, or 60 cents a share, 3 per cent ahead of the Dollars 98m, or 58 cents, in the first-half. This was in line with many analysts' expectations. The interim dividend is boosted by 6 per cent, from 18 cents to 19 cents a share. After spending more than Dollars 1bn in the past five years, Minorco still has net cash and short-term investments of just over Dollars 1bn. Interest from this, less corporate and exploration expenses, contributed Dollars 59.6m in the half-year, down from Dollars 65.5m, and Minorco's share of equity-accounted investments brought in Dollars 52.6m, up from Dollars 44m. Minorco's gold operations, mainly Independence Mining in Nevada, suffered an operating loss of Dollars 13.1m, compared with a profit of Dollars 4.2m, and the operating loss at the Terra fertiliser business in the US rose to Dollars 23.2m, from Dollars 11.5m. The Hudson Bay Mining and Smelting base metals subsidiary increased operating profits from Dollars 3.1m to Dollars 10.4m. During the half-year, Minorco spent Dollars 104m to take an interest in the Collahausi copper project in Chile, and Dollars 127m went to develop existing businesses.</p>

			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / Arts: Time of My Life Alan Ayckbourn's new play is a discouraged comedy for sextet, or more precisely (like a well-known piece by the composer Elliott Carter) for three semi-detached duos. Those are the senior Strattons, Gerry and Laura; their smooth-talking, unreliable son Glyn and his off-and-on wife Stephanie; and the arty younger son Adam with his innocently punkish girl Maureen. There are also some wild cards, a restaurateur and four of his waiters (all played by a single actor), for everything happens in the Strattons' favourite local restaurant. The central occasion, the core of the play, is Laura's 54th birthday party. In a sense, the play goes nowhere; instead it expands in ripples fore and aft, but always returning to its base. Ayckbourn likes to play formal games, and Time of My Life is highly regimented. Not only do all its events take place at three different tables in that restaurant, but the Janus-faced chronology - more complicated than Sondheim's in Merrily We Roll Along - is strictly apportioned. Adam and Maureen are traced backwards from the party through several dates to their first accidental meeting; Glyn and Stephanie's uneasy lunches run forward, through Laura's widowhood, to their inevitable split. Laura and Gerry are seen only in 'real time', in successive moments of the party - though we glimpse the beginning of that only at the end. The writing leaves room for plenty of laughs (the Scarborough audience was loyally forthcoming), and the cast secures them with sharp, sympathetic playing. Yet there are scarcely any frank gags, nor anything like farcical mechanics - deceptions, disguises, crucial misunderstandings - until the first (final) encounter of the youngest pair, by which time a dash of farce is welcome: the dying fall of the play has been somewhat protracted. Heretofore, Ayckbourn's canny naturalism has usually taken off from some bizarre or frenetic spring in the plot. This time everything is as Northern-ordinary as can be, including the relevant adulterous bits, and such little revelations as crop up surprise only the characters, not the audience. But that is the point: to detached observers, there is never much doubt about the paths these lives are taking. The 'time of your life', by the way, is expressly identified as the time when you were happiest but didn't know it. Whether or not that is a sentimental premise, it is a barbed one for comedy. We watch the characters gently succumbing to wounds they might have recognised but didn't: funnier for us than for them, of course, but almost as painful too. Yet there is also a pervasive sense that each of them does know pretty well what he or she is doing, and what the others make of that ' as if they were willing their own deserts while preferring not to admit it. Not the first time in Ayckbourn's work that this fatalistic sub-text has surfaced: it is what makes him something more than a comic playwright. Richard Garnett's Glyn boasts almost as much well-lubricated charm and confidence as he thinks he has, and Stephen Mapes is the picture of flustered good intentions. Colette O'Neill's Laura is nicely ambiguous between being toughly sensible and just brutally tough, and Sophie Heyman brings more touching subtleties to poor Maureen than one would think the role permitted. Terence Booth has a wonderful time with his Mediterranean restaurant-personnel, all neatly differentiated ' and cleverly employed in Ayckbourn's plot, too, not mere local colour. The equally put-upon Gerry and Stephanie seemed to be in safe hands with Russell Dixon and Karen Drury; but from seat no. D10, more often than not I saw only the backs of their heads. With a play in which everyone is usually facing someone else across a fixed table, there are bound to be geographical problems in a theatre-in-the-round like the Stephen Joseph. Stephen Joseph Theatre, Scarborough, in repertory until July 15.</p>

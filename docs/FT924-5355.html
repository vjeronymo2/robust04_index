			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / France to seek EC Mideast aid fund: Mitterrand holds talks with Rabin before going on to Amman FRANCE will press the European Community to create an Ecu1bn (Pounds 800m) fund for economic development in the Middle East to back peace negotiations in the region, President Francois Mitterrand said in Jerusalem yesterday. Stressing the role Paris and the Community could play in the multilateral negotiations on regional co-operation, he said the EC should levy up to Ecu1bn from its economic development fund for joint projects in areas such as water, tourism, transport and trade. It would also encourage 'useful forms of dialogue' between Arabs and Israel, Mr Mitterrand said. 'This is an initiative which France very much wishes to pass on to the European Council.' The president was speaking after talks with Yitzhak Rabin, prime minister. He and Mr Roland Dumas, his foreign minister, also met Mr Faisal Husseini, the senior Palestinian leader in the occupied territories, and members of the Palestinian delegation to the Middle East negotiations. He travels on to Jordan today for talks with King Hussein. He described Israel's approach to the peace talks, which have progressed only slowly since they began a year ago, as 'very positive' and expressed support for the process despite reservations about exclusion of the Palestine Liberation Organisation. Mr Rabin said he had asked France to urge the Palestinians to shed their objections and press ahead with the negotiations. But both Mr Mitterrand and Mr Rabin played down suggestions that the president was acting as an intermediary in the bilateral talks. French and Israeli officials signed four bilateral co-operation agreements, including an accord on joint scientific research and an outline for an electric railway project.</p>

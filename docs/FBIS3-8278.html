Vychodil (ODS), head of the parliamentary </F> mission to the North Atlantic Assembly, by Nada Adamickova;  place and date not given: "The World Does Not Perceive the  Controversial Statements by Our Representative All That  Dramatically"]    [Text] [Adamickova] Do you agree that, in foreign policy  and related matters, party interests should not dominate?    [Vychodil] I agree absolutely. As a matter of fact, if the  party interests dominated somewhere, which is not the case, I  would consider it fatal for our foreign policy.    [Adamickova] So, you do not consider the big ado regarding  Foreign Committee Chairman J. Payne, when even the Civic  Democratic Party [ODS] itself had significant objections to his  statements but defended him on the outside because his "recall  was demanded by the opposition," to be a promotion of party  interests?    [Vychodil] I will take the liberty of answering this direct  question diplomatically because what you are referring to is  actually diplomacy. The matter in question is really a  parliamentary experiment with a coexistence of fire and water,  with the provision that the fire must not be extinguished and  water must not be heated up very much. Hence, it is a certain  type of art, which man must learn to command. He has to learn  in what area and on what topic he is to comment. Regarding the  statements by colleague Payne, then, I know his views because he  is a friend and colleague of mine, one of the most diligent  people in this Chamber. What has been published does not  completely correspond to his opinions.    [Adamickova] Nevertheless, at the session of the Foreign  Committee, at which Payne was explaining his trip and statements  he made in the United States, a detailed recording was heard of  the meeting with compatriots, including precisely the phrases  that appeared in the Czech press.    [Vychodil] Unfortunately, I did not take part in this  session because I was abroad. Therefore, I cannot comment.    [Adamickova] Would you not agree that the Foreign Committee  chairman should be more careful with what he says because he  could possibly damage the interests of the Republic abroad?    [Vychodil] The question is how the statements by our  politicians are perceived in the world--namely, I do not believe  that statements made by the representatives of our parliament  are perceived as neuralgically as we imagine. That is hardly  the case. I believe that it is rather an internal affair. It is  certain, however, that, given certain circumstances--i.e., if  there were some hostile feelings against our Republic, it cannot  be ruled out that the effect of some statements could be used  against us. In this instance, however, it certainly did not  happen.    [Adamickova] Do you believe it proper that your committee  dealt with Payne's statements?    [Vychodil] I believe that the Foreign Committee is an  autonomous body of the Chamber and can deal with whatever it  sees appropriate. This right cannot be questioned. As far as  my personal opinion goes, I do not believe it good if it deals  with the statements of its chairman in his absence.    [Adamickova] The second time around, however, your committee  dealt with the statements in the presence of its chairman, who  declared that they should deal with foreign policy rather than  matters of personnel....    [Vychodil] I repeat again that the committee can deal with  whatever it considers appropriate. It is simply a question of  majority democracy. If the opposition holds a majority on the  committee, it is a different matter entirely.    [Adamickova] How do you feel about our foreign policy  suffering the malady of dearth of coordination?    [Vychodil] Of course, I am of the opinion that foreign  policy should be coordinated and clear-cut. We have to realize  one thing, however: Disparate statements by different  representatives of the same state are nothing unusual. That is  again overestimating something on our part. Let us take a  specific example of the North Atlantic Alliance ultimatum to  Bosnia, for instance. It is possible that, in statements for  the press, various sides of the same problem are emphasized.  One more, one less. Thus, it depends on what is more important  from the point of view of that representative. Personally, I do  not see it as a tragedy, and it is not perceived dramatically in  the world. On the other hand, I must say frankly that our  Republic is judged from a different perspective. What is only  recorded in the instance of traditionally democratic countries  is occasionally dramatized in our instance. Fortunately, this  trend exists only here.    [Adamickova] Excuse me, but I cannot agree with you  regarding the specific example of the Bosnia ultimatum when you  speak about the unequal emphasis. The difference between the  statements by the president and the prime minister certainly was  not one of emphasis but of a completely different stance.    [Vychodil] Allow me to polemicize. We have here the  resolution adopted by the Foreign Committee on the situation in  Bosnia. When you read it, you will find that both  aforementioned views fit in there, and it really is just a  matter of emphasis. It is one thing if we emphasize the force  of the ultimatum, and another the bombing itself. We know that  it is a dangerous thing, and the consequences can hardly be  imagined.    [Adamickova] How do you, as the head of our parliamentary  mission to the North Atlantic Assembly, view this problem?    [Vychodil] I do not believe that the conflict in Bosnia was  brought there from without but, rather, that it is a problem  that was dormant there. It is a very complex issue, where the  Catholic civilization meets with the orthodox and the Muslim  ones. The entire local history is very complex, and I see it as  a conflict of cultures. I believe that the conflict cannot be  solved in simple terms, and, to be frank, I do not know a  responsible person who could imagine such a solution. I am  convinced that the conflict cannot be solved from without. In  any instance of a simplification, it may result in a threat to  the security of not only that region but also the entire Balkans  and, by extension, Europe. And we are only a six-hour drive  from there. We must realize this and be very careful with  various strong and unqualified statements.    [Adamickova] Do you believe that, if I accept your theory of  different emphases, Czech interests could not have been damaged?    [Vychodil] It certainly was recorded, but just as certainly  it will not damage our interests.    [Adamickova] Several days ago, your committee dealt with the  preparations of a trip to Germany. This occurred after the  parliamentary delegation began its visit to the German  Parliament last December in a rather awkward way. Do you not  believe it late to prepare a trip at the time when a faux pas  takes place?    [Vychodil] I believe that preparations for a trip should be  a matter of fact. Nevertheless--and do not take this as an  excuse but, rather, as a statement of fact--we learn certain  things by the hit-and-miss method. The misses are sometimes  painful; at other times they are not.    [Adamickova] In a RUDE PRAVO interview, former Foreign  Minister Dienstbier criticized some of our politicians for their  opinion that what is happening east of us should not be at the  center of our attention. Do you agree?    [Vychodil] I am deeply convinced that what is happening east  of us must be at the center of our attention rather than not.  Not to care about it could be fatal. I insist on this,  regardless of what the politicians Dienstbier mentioned are like.    [Adamickova] At the same time, Dienstbier said that we had  the opportunity to become the country we claim to be on the  occasion of Bill Clinton's visit, but we did not use it. What  is your opinion?    [Vychodil] Our country gained respect by the U.S.  President's choice of it as the place to go. That speaks for  itself. Regarding the respect per se, it is necessary to follow  foreign press and statements by foreign politicians, who tend to  agree that the Czech Republic is the best off of all of the  postcommunist countries. That, I believe, is the best evidence.  Moreover, I cannot imagine how we could prove this respect. By  a one-time act or a declaration? After all, the world is not  moved by opinions but, rather, by people and their cooperation,  if I am to phrase it in a somewhat elevated manner.    [Adamickova] Do you agree that the belief that if someone is  admitted to NATO, it would be the Czech Republic first, and no  one will joint the Alliance without it is exaggerated? I am  referring to Payne's statements made in the United States.    [Vychodil] I am not talking about entry into NATO but,  rather, an integration of world security structures. If  countries are to join, they must know everything it involves.  That is not just having a protecting umbrella. It also means a  certain economic burden and, especially, a certain way of  assuming responsibility. In other words, if countries want to  join the Alliance, they must be democratic and economically  stable, and membership can be built on that. I emphasize again  that it is not some act or declaration but a process.    [Adamickova] You have not answered my question....    [Vychodil] I tried to answer it fully. Regarding your  question, it is possible that we will be first to join NATO. It  is also possible that it will be someone else. I would applaud  him and certainly not envy him.</p>

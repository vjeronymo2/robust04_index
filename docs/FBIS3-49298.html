			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Podkrepa National Strike Committee held a  meeting today at the headquarters of the Podkrepa Labor  Confederation, which was attended by representatives of the  strike committees of 15 federations and 21 regions throughout  the country.    The participants adopted a draft decision, which notes that  a  strike situation exists in the country. The General Assembly  proposes to the Podkrepa Executive and Federative Councils to  complete the preparations for national strike activities by 1  February. Those activities will be aimed, I quote, against the  antihuman and antisocial policy of Professor Berov's government.    The draft decision will be submitted to the Podkrepa  Federative Council, which is scheduled to meet on 16-17 January  in Blagoevgrad.</p>

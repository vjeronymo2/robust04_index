			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Primary colours: Lionel Barber on George Bush's electoral opponents Mr Patrick Buchanan, the right-wing Republican challenger in the US election campaign, has a great strength: he knows how to get under President Bush's skin. This skill will not be enough to overcome glaring weaknesses in Mr Buchanan's guerrilla campaign; but it lends an unpredictability to the New Hampshire primary election on February 18, the first critical test of the 1992 campaign. Mr Buchanan calls the globe-trotting Mr Bush 'President of the World'. He accuses him of 'breaking faith' with the Republican party by raising taxes; and he ridicules his preppy background. 'The only unemployed person he knows here is John Sununu,' says Mr Buchanan, referring to the former New Hampshire governor who was fired from his job as White House chief-of-staff two months ago. Mr Bush would love to ignore these jibes. Mr Buchanan is, after all, a simple television pundit and former speech writer to presidents Nixon and Reagan who has never held elected office. But if there were any lingering doubts about the folly of this approach, they evaporated this week when Mr Bush made his first campaign trip to New Hampshire. Early on Wednesday morning, the president received a first-hand account of the economic disaster which has struck the once-thriving New England state and which is driving the protest vote behind Mr Buchanan. At Pease Air Force base, business and community leaders told Mr Bush the same grim story: 55,000 jobs lost; 22m sq ft of unleased industrial real estate; five of the top seven banks closed; and a 33 per cent drop in home values. Mr Bush responded gingerly: 'I think I've known this economy is in free fall, maybe I've not conveyed it as well as I should. But I do understand.' These penitent tones sound familiar. Four years ago, when he was vice-president, Mr Bush arrived in Iowa to compete in the caucus vote, offered sympathy to stricken farmers and was soundly thrashed. His bid for the White House barely alive, Mr Bush was rescued by a victory in the New Hampshire primary, largely because of his pledge not to raise taxes. Mr Buchanan pounds away at this broken promise (part of the 1990 budget agreement with Congress which Mr Bush backed in order to cut the Federal budget deficit by Dollars 500bn over five years). And he replays the same slogan which Mr Ronald Reagan used to defeat President Jimmy Carter in 1980: 'Are you better off four years ago than you are now?' The six Democratic candidates are toying with similar themes in their own primary race here, particularly with their appeal to middle-class Americans who have watched their real incomes stagnate over the past 10 years. Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, a centrist who has deliberately shunned the liberal activist vote, has emerged as an early front runner. He faces a tough challenge from former senator Paul Tsongas from neighbouring Massachusetts - and is certain to be attacked during tomorrow's televised debate by Senator Bob Kerrey, the Vietnam war hero whose campaign has curiously failed to ignite. (Another potential weakness centres on the Gary Hart-style rumours about Mr Clinton's past). This week, Mr Bush offered a glimpse of his re-election strategy. Apologies aside, he wants to lean on his strengths: the Gulf war victory and the esteem in which the public holds his wife Barbara. He will also count on a favourable response to his forthcoming state of the Union address to Congress. Without offering details, the president promised to avoid quick fixes in the economy, focusing instead on long-term measures such as investment tax credits, saving incentives, possible tax credit for first-time home buyers and a plan to reform the hugely expensive US health care system. These plans underline the power of incumbency in which Mr Bush faces a dilemma. He needs the support of the Democratic Congress to turn his plan into action. If he compromises too much, he will be accused by Mr Buchanan of being a collaborator with the Democrats. This could prove the true significance of the Buchanan challenge. Almost no one expects him to win in New Hampshire; but he could easily gain 30-40 per cent of the vote because voters may calculate they can afford the luxury of a protest vote in February before supporting Mr Bush in November. A huge protest vote against Mr Bush would not be enough to make him drop out of the race as President Lyndon Johnson did in 1968 after the strong showing of Senator Eugene McCarthy. But Mr Bush would likely have to tack to the right, adopting some of Mr Buchanan's 'America first' rhetoric and making ever more partisan attacks against the Democratic majority in Congress. This runs against Mr Bush's nature, and could leave the middle ground exposed to a Democratic challenger in November. No wonder the Bush camp is worried.</p>

			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: New yarn from Coats Coats Viyella has a well-deserved reputation for squeezing cash out of textiles; it has not been everyone's first choice in the past for a financial reporting award. Even recognising the need to explain how Tootal has been integrated and the forthcoming requirements of the Accounting Standards Board, however, the quality and sheer volume of information backing up the 1991 results merit at least a commendation. The Coats charm offensive still has some way to go to convince City sceptics; other companies pondering the limits of disclosure might reflect on yesterday's 5 per cent jump in the shares. Eyebrows will still be raised, of course, by the Pounds 88m of fair value adjustments and integration provisions. The figure is high in relation to expectations, but, to be fair to Coats, can probably be reconciled with the dreadful performance of the fabrics division. In any case the way existing provisions have been scrupulously reversed into an extraordinary 1991 gain should inspire confidence that Coats would not resort to any acquisition accounting sleights of hand. The main message from yesterday's figures is that even in a prolonged recession Tootal was a sound buy. The feared loss of thread market share, for example, has not materialised and savings look to be coming through as planned. The balance sheet is a bit stretched by Coats' historic standards, but given the strong cash flow from continuing operations gearing should fall fairly quickly. That said, the shares may be held back by short-term political uncertainties and doubts about the profits momentum in 1993.</p>

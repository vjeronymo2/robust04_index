			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / The Rail Dispute: Horton and Knapp to 'chat' - Railtrack chief to meet minister again Railtrack chairman Mr Bob Horton and Mr Jimmy Knapp, the RMT transport union's general secretary, will meet soon about the increasingly bitter signalling staff dispute. This emerged yesterday when the two men appeared before the Commons employment committee. After much pressure from Mr Greville Janner, the committee's Labour chairman, Mr Horton agreed that he should have what Mr Janner called a 'little chat' with Mr Knapp. Mr Knapp was quick to accept a meeting. 'Yes, of course. I would be a fool not to say so,' he told Mr Janner. Mr Janner made clear at the start of the hearings that he understood that neither side would want to prejudice a return to negotiations to try to settle the conflict. At one moment a Conservative member of the committee had to restrain an increasingly irate Mr Janner who seemed particularly incensed to discover that Mr Horton has been in regular contact with Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, since the conflict began early last month. The Railtrack chairman said he had seen Mr MacGregor 'three or four times' and after consulting his diary informed Mr Janner his next session with the transport secretary would be tomorrow. The Railtrack team caused exasperation when they were unable to tell the MPs what the average earnings of signal workers were. Mr David Armstrong, the company's industrial relations director, ploughed hurriedly through his file of documents in search of the vital statistics in an increasingly frantic manner. Mr Janner suggested in headmasterly style that perhaps he should leave the room to find the figure. Mr Armstrong eventually revealed the figure to be Pounds 16,650 a year for a 50.1 hour working week. Mr Horton was in conciliatory mood. He said he did not regard the signal staff as Luddites - 'the last word I would use to describe them'. He talked warmly of a 'beneficial cycle' that would ensure the men high earnings in return for productivity improvements. Committee members expressed surprise at what they saw as the signalling staff's poor levels of pay for long hours of work. Mr Knapp made it clear that his members had 'strong feelings' about their pay grievances. Mr John Major said yesterday that he was 'pretty fed up' with the rail strikes. He said during a visit to Edinburgh that millions of people had accepted low wage rises in the past two years. 'I don't think they would think it right for Railtrack to concede an 11 per cent rise to the signallers without any productivity improvements.'</p>

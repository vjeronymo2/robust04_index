			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Clark chairman quits in aftermath of failed bid MR WALTER Dickson, chairman of C&amp;J Clark, has announced his resignation from the family-owned shoe company which recently rejected a controversial bid from Berisford International after months of boardroom dissention. Mr Dickson, appointed on a three year contract in 1991, is expected to step down within the next three months. The chairman, who backed the Berisford bid, will receive no compensation payments other than the outstanding balance of his salary which was Pounds 206,000 last year. He will retain options, which must be exercised by 1995, over 615,000 shares at 130p. Earlier this year, the shares were valued at 100p. The resignation was widely expected following the extraordinary meeting in May, where shareholders agreed to implement corporate governance proposals in a bid to fend off Berisford. In a letter to shareholders this weekend, Mr Dickson said flotation was expected to occur within three to four years. He also announced that Mr Roger Peddar, a director, had been appointed deputy chairman. Speaking from his home, Mr Dickson said the difficulties of the past year had 'reflected the deep-seated problems of coming to the conclusions they (Clark shareholders) had to come to . . . I acted as the agent of change.' Success would now depend on implementing to the full all the promises made at the EGM, he said. Flotation must be done on 'a proper basis . . . with no strange mechanisms'. Clark has in recent years considered flotation through the issue of preference shares which would leave the controlling family shareholding intact. Mr Dickson also said Clark, which saw pre-tax profits fall from Pounds 20.4m to Pounds 1.7m last year, had returned encouraging results in recent months particularly in light of the devaluation of sterling. It is expected that the company will return profits of more than Pounds 16m in the current year.</p>

			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / International Capital Markets: UK-Dutch link suggests Europe options network THE process of greater co-operation between European derivatives exchanges will advance a step further on Monday when the planned link between OM London and the European Options Exchange in Amsterdam starts to operate. It will be the first real-time trading and clearing link between independent European exchanges. But if plans and negotiations bear fruit, it could be the first of a series of links, ultimately creating a network of European futures exchanges which allows members of one exchange access to a broad range of European markets. Initially, EOE members will be able to trade and clear options on the OMX Swedish stock index, while OML members will have access to options on the Eurotop 100 index and the EOE-Index, made up of 25 Dutch shares, creating cost savings of as much as 50 per cent, according to Mr Lynton Jones, chief executive of OML. Earlier this month, Germany's Deutsche Terminborse and France's Matif announced the most important co-operation pact between European exchanges to date. They aim to implement the first step of the agreement - the installation of DTB terminals in Paris allowing Matif members to trade DTB bund futures - by the beginning of next year. The trading link between OM and EOE is the first in a series of linkages planned by First European Exchanges (FEX), an alliance created last year by EOE, OM London and OM Stockholm, Soffex in Switzerland and Otob in Austria. The alliance 'should give exchanges access to each others' membership without creating additional clearing costs,' said Mr Jones of OML. Links between Soffex and OML and between OML and Otob are being developed, and could be in place by the end of the third quarter. A further link between OML and Otob would then be implemented: it is technically the most straightforward, since the Otob exchange uses the OM screen trading system. In addition, other smaller European exchanges may join FEX: Italy's Mif and Spain's Meff are the likeliest candidates. The Matif and the DTB have said that they would welcome discussions with other exchanges. As the process gains pace, Liffe, Europe's largest exchange, which offers a broad array of European products, appears increasingly isolated. However, Liffe is in discussion over a link with the Chicago Board of Trade, and is considering joining Globex, the after-hours trading system.</p>

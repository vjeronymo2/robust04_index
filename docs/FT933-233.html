			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Uruguay deadline seen as last chance - A new, almost palpable sense of urgency over liberalisation talks DEADLINES in the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks have come and gone. But this time there is a new and almost palpable sense of urgency among negotiators in Geneva to wrap up the seven-year-old talks by December 15, when the US administration's negotiating authority runs out. 'December 15 is the agreed deadline for the deal to be done,' Mr Peter Sutherland, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, told finance ministers on the International Monetary Fund's policy-making interim committee at the weekend. 'I can see no possibility whatsoever of another chance.' Mr Sutherland has set the 116 nations taking part in the Round a demanding timetable for each remaining stage of the negotiations. Today's meeting of the top-level trade negotiations committee is expected to confirm that so far the talks are broadly on track, but a huge amount of work is still needed. The most pressing demand is to complete country-by-country talks on opening markets for foreign goods and services. For goods the negotiations must be largely completed by October 15, with a further month to finalise draft country tariff schedules. For services, the timetable envisages a final round of bilateral talks in the second half of October. By common consent, these negotiations now represent the key to the success of the Round. Only if countries are happy with the results can other difficult issues related to the Uruguay Round framework of rules be resolved. For instance, Latin American nations need specific pledges of improved access for their highly competitive farm goods if they are to swallow what they regard as a sorely inadequate US-EC deal on farm subsidies, the so-called Blair House agreement. Progress on lowering trade barriers for goods has been mixed. Negotiations on farm products, which were not covered by the four-way tariff deal between the biggest traders last July, are only just starting to move after the hiatus caused by French sniping at the Blair House agreement. This is no longer seen as a blockage since the decision of EC foreign and farm ministers on September 20 not to seek to renegotiate the accord with Washington. The French, like everyone else, will now be faced with accepting or rejecting the entire Uruguay Round package when the talks are over. Trade officials also point out that the process of 'multilateralising' Blair House as part of negotiations to finalise the rules on farm trade reform could provide some scope for the 'additions and clarifications' Paris has demanded. Refusal by Japan to accept the principle of 'tariffication without exception' (conversion of all trade restrictions into tariffs), which would mean opening its closed rice market, has become the main obstacle to progress, trade officials say. There has been more activity on industrial products, but developing countries have complained that the 'Quad' deal between the US, EC, Japan and Canada contained little of interest to them. US agreement to reduce high tariffs on textiles is seen as essential to moving along the talks, paving the way for offers by developing countries to reduce their own tariffs on textiles and other goods and for the EC to do more in areas such as electronics, non-ferrous metals, wood, paper and pulp. In services the picture is brighter. A revised draft General Agreement on Trade in Services, complete with annexes on air transport, financial services, telecommunications and labour mobility, will be presented to negotiators tomorrow. The tricky issues here relate to maritime transport, audio-visual services and financial services. The US is refusing to open ocean-going shipping to all comers, to the dismay of many shipping nations, including the Nordic countries and EC members such as Greece. The EC - with backing from others such as India, Australia and Canada - is resisting on 'cultural' grounds US demands for unrestricted access to the European film, video and television markets. Elsewhere, the US and the EC are united in pressing mainly south-east Asian nations to open financial services to foreign competition. In private, trade diplomats in Geneva expect a trade-off between US and EC interests in maritime and audio-visual services, with both keeping existing restrictions. However, a US threat to keep its own financial services off the table if others do not come through with adequate offers in this area could still wreck the talks. Only once the market access package seems to be coming together will Mr Sutherland gingerly open up some of the contentious aspects of the Uruguay Round rules package drafted in December 1991. Apart from the amendments to the farm trade rules resulting from the Blair House accord, the other predicted trouble spots are US demands for changes to the anti-dumping text and its vacillation over proposals for a strong Multilateral Trade Organisation. The end-game will not be easy, especially if, as many in Geneva fear, the garnering of congressional votes in Washington for the controversial North American Free Trade Agreement leaves US negotiators with little room for manoeuvre.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- THE GAINS FROM URUGUAY ROUND SUCCESS - YEAR 2002                                                              Dollars bn  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Global price of distortions due to protectionism                    477 Gains of partial liberalisation as result of Uruguay Round: * Remove 30 per cent of tariffs and subsidies for agriculture:   gains for OECD countries                                          120   gains for LDCs and former planned economies                        70                                                                    ____ Total gains through farm trade reform                               190 * Cut tariffs on manufactured goods by 30 per cent:   gains for OECD countries                                         14.7   gains for LDCs and former planned economies                       8.3                                                                    ____ Total gains through industry trade reform                            23 Total gains from Uruguay Round liberalisation                       213 Cost of remaining distortions                                       264  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Trade Liberalisation: What's at stake?, published by World Bank and OECD Development Centre.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

ANTI-FUR MARCH  </P> <P> Six pallbearers carrying a black coffin filled with furs led a Manhattan march  of about 400 anti-fur demonstrators Saturday in a protest against the killing  of animals for their pelts.  </P> <P> A 3-block stretch of protesters left a memorial service early in the afternoon  and headed down Columbus Avenue, scattering people bundled up in furs because  of bitterly cold weather.  </P> <P> The protest was one of three planned over the next few days to mark the end of  winter, when merchants sell most of their furs.  </P></p>

			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Venture capital Last week's news that Midland Bank plans to offer customers venture capital through its UK branches may have sent shivers of apprehension through the shareholders of HSBC. Have not most of the UK clearers in some form tried - and failed - over the last 15 years to supply equity to smaller businesses? And even if it could hardly happen on a Latin American scale, could this latest initiative not be another recipe for losing heroic sums of investors' money? It is right to be sceptical, but it is worth bearing in mind that there is an urgent demand for this form of finance. The venture capital industry - much of it imported from the US - took the UK by storm in the last recession and raised huge sums of money from institutions eager to invest in smaller companies. The fact remains, however, that owing to the high fixed costs of each transaction and the prospect of juicier returns most UK funds are only interested in sizeable management buy-outs or development capital deals in the Pounds 250,000 to Pounds 1m range. Unfashionable as it may be to say so, the equity gap for businesses seeking Pounds 50,000 to Pounds 250,000 is alive and well. In theory, the banks should be ideally placed to help given their nationwide networks and large balance sheets. But in practice - best illustrated by the rise and fall of National Westminster's Growth Options initiative - bankers themselves have not made good venture capitalists. On top of this, it has proved difficult in practice to identify the good propositions, without damaging traditional banking relationships and alienating managers in the field. Midland's centrally-based team of professional venture capitalists - working through the corporate banking centres which in common with its peers it has established over the last decade - is another attempt to find the solution. The risks remain, but in theory the service should be more cost effective than say 3i. Midland is at least addressing the problem that many small business loans at this stage in the cycle are de facto equity without the upside. The prize for any bank getting it right will be a lucrative one.</p>

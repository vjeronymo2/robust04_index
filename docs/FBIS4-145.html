			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Jonas Savimbi, chairman of the National Union for  the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA], has promised that  there can be no impasse at the Lusaka talks. The UNITA chairman  and supreme commander of the Armed Forces for the Liberation of  Angola reiterated UNITA's commitment to searching for peace.    Addressing about 2,000 Angolans and foreigners at the  wedding  reception for Engineer Adalberto da Costa Jr., UNITA  representative in Portugal, on 30 March, Dr. Savimbi said [words  indistinct] he promised that UNITA will do its best to bring  about peace. He added: We will all have peace and will organize  our economy in a stable atmosphere. He said he was willing to  make every concession, provided that it is not humiliating,  because men (?want to live) in freedom and dignity. He noted  that there can be no freedom without dignity.    The UNITA leader thanked humanitarian organizations for  their  aid in food, medicine, and clothing [words indistinct], and he  invited officials of several relief organizations to feel at  home.

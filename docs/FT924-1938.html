			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / Eurotunnel offer rejected by contractors TRANSMANCHE Link, the group of contractors building the Channel tunnel, yesterday brought into the open the simmering row over payments from Eurotunnel and implied that completion of Europe's largest construction project could be further delayed. A statement issued by TML's 10 contractor members said Eurotunnel had made an inadequate offer of Pounds 1.2bn to settle the cost overrun on fixed equipment and fitting out of the tunnel. In particular, Eurotunnel's offer that about Pounds 200m of this should be paid with instruments such as shares, bonds and convertible instruments was unacceptable. The statement, a year before the Channel tunnel is scheduled to operate, suggests that lack of co-operation between contractors and Eurotunnel could further delay the opening until the first quarter of 1994. Eurotunnel's shares closed down 11p at 329p. Admission of the disagreement comes after events had been moving against the TML contractors. One observer said: 'TML is running out of the main weapon it has, which is time.' Last month the committee of 220 creditor banks agreed to allow Eurotunnel to continue drawing down on its Pounds 6.8bn facility until after May 1994, when even the greatest pessimists expect the tunnel to be open. The longer the row continues, however, the less likely is a phased introduction of tunnel operations allowing goods trains to begin before passenger operations. The two sides have been negotiating this contract modification, which could favour Eurotunnel by hastening revenue-earning. TML's main concern appears to be the composition of the Pounds 1.2bn payment. It believes that since Eurotunnel's offer in the summer, the cash element has been reduced and the non-cash element has increased. Eurotunnel accepts this but says it falls within the August offer. Both sides stress they are willing to continue talking and work on the project is continuing. TML's joint chairmen said that an early settlement would 'allow revenue-earning services to commence as soon as possible'. Eurotunnel said its priority was to complete the project as early as already agreed possible 'so that it can open for revenue service in December 1993'.

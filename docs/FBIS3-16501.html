			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksandr Mineyev] </F>   [Text] Brussels, 16 Mar TASS -- Moldova has become the 12th  state to join the Partnership for Peace programme offered by  NATO to former Soviet Republics and East European countries in  January.    Moldovan President Mircea Snegur signed the appropriate  agreement in NATO headquarters in Brussels on Wednesday.    Speaking at the signing ceremony, the Moldovan leader said  that the Partnership for Peace programme would certainly help  strengthen national security and territorial integrity of his  country.    Snegur said he was ready to begin working out proposals to  conclude a bilateral partnership agreement which would define  the character and the extent of Moldovan cooperation with NATO.    Snegur also said the mechanism of consultations with NATO  envisaged by the "Partnership for Peace" is very important for  any country whose territorial integrity, political independence,  and security are threatened.    The Moldovan president reiterated that the 14th Russian Army  deployed on moldovan territory plays the main stumbling effect  for the political settlement of the conflict between Moldova and  its eastern Dniester province.    According to Snegur, negotiations should be held on the  terms  of troops withdrawal. He expressed confidence that the new  Moldovan parliament would adopt a law granting the Dniester  province a special legal status to help the withdrawal of the  14th Russian Army.    NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner said that NATO  favours  a prompt and complete withdrawal of foreign troops from Moldova.    He also emphasised that in the proposed partnership scheme,  the North Atlantic alliance does not want to exclude or isolate  any country. NATO expects Russia to join the "Partnership for  Peace" programme, Woerner stressed. The participation of all  invited countries will play an important role in implementing  our efforts to build a new Europe, he said.    Today, Moldova, Romania, Lithuania, Poland, Estonia,  Hungary,  Ukraine, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Latvia, and Czech Republic have  joined the "Partnership for Peace" programme. Many leaders of  these countries consider joining this programme as the first  step towards full membership in NATO.    Russia has expressed its support for the programme,  estimating it as a mechanism of strengthening security of  coopration in Europe.</p>

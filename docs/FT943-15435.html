			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / Go-ahead for Pounds 30m Belfast complex Plans for a Pounds 30m leisure complex in the eastern suburbs of Belfast were yesterday granted outline planning permission by the Department of the Environment, Tim Coone writes. The project, dubbed locally as 'Ulster Disneyland', will be built on a 100-acre site surrounding the Dungannon Ice Bowl, already a leading leisure centre, and will be the biggest project of its kind in Northern Ireland. It will include theme parks, 'white-knuckle' rides, a golf course and driving range, adventure playground, parkland and water sports. Mr Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the Democratic Unionist party and a member of Castlereagh Borough Council, which will be part-funding the project, welcomed the planning decision. Most of the project finance is to come from European Union structural funds and private-sector developers.</p>

			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Gardening: In praise of old Chinese practices / Plans for autumn's finest flower The start to winter has been extraordinarily kind, but we are all wishing that there were more flowers in the garden. Some of you are looking forward to Christmas; I am looking forward to an end to examining young hopefuls for entry to Oxford. Could we not pool our wishes and come up with something to satisfy everyone? I now think I have found it in a recent study of life in southern China. In the Pearl River delta, the town of Xiaolan has, over 200 years, evolved what we need. In late autumn, it holds its great festival of the chrysanthemum, the history of which was studied beautifully in 1990 by a Dr Siu. And, instead of twinning, the town has changed its name. It now calls itself the Town of Chrysanthemums. In the past, when the upper classes still wrote poetry, upper-class townsmen there would meet in poetic groups and write poems to chrysanthemums. They also wrote chrysanthemum operas. As the social pyramid widened, the poetry dwindled and the music became more popular. Old blood had to compete with new money for social honour by displaying autumn's finest flower. The festivals have been revived and, in a new municipal age, the town now makes little delicacies with a chrysanthemum flavour. During the festival, the flowers are still graded in pots, marked, and given prizes. In Britain's climate, I quite see that town councils could find such cultivation difficult and might opt for a Universal Pansy Week instead. So, I have been going round the growers, asking how to grow top-class chrysanths in our busy, fragmented lives. The easiest answer is to grow some of the few hardy forms outdoors and cut the flowers before the rain and frost ruins them. They have been misleadingly good in this mild year but, in any season, I recommend the buttoned bronze flowers of Dr Tom Parr, the favourite of the connoisseurs; and the single white-flowered Wedding Day, which was selected and shown by Rushfields of Ledbury at the late-November Royal Horticultural Society show. These hardy forms are even better than the semi-hardy Korean varieties which have to be lifted yearly and treated like dahlias in a frost-proof shed. They are not, however, the exhibitor's dream. To find this, you need to visit the RHS headquarters at Wisley, Surrey, where the national trials have been running for the past five years. At Wisley, I fell for the superb, sunny-yellow Victor Rowe with large flowers that van Gogh would have loved to paint. The strong stems of White Cassandra are its near equal; the season can be prolonged until Christmas if you add in the quill-shaped flowers of the Elegance group. These varieties have stood up particularly well to the long trials, and Wisley's expert curators recommend them. All these varieties need the support of a greenhouse and heat from October until April. Every year, they should be started from small cuttings, rooted in February and planted in 3in pots. Even the big UK growers now buy in their cuttings from specialists, most of whom grow them in Israel, Madeira and other sunny countries. Chrysanthemums are acutely responsive to warm sunlight. Light encourages their early growth, whereas lengthening darkness promotes the change from growing to flowering. Commercially, growers now manipulate the season by shortening daylight artificially, aiming to extract 3 1/2 cycles of flower in one year. The rest of us leave the natural darkness of late autumn to do the trick. Late in spring, after the frosts, your rooted chrysanths can be stood outside and potted on through 3in, 5in and 9in pots. They like fresh air and fertiliser and respond to plenty of potash from September onwards (available easily in the Tomorite which we use on tomatoes). On October 1, they must return under glass and, ideally, must be warmed along to opening time with a sustained temperature of 50-60`F. As you can see, they are not suitable for gardeners without a heated greenhouse; heated rooms indoors do not have enough light. The reason why civilised eyes dislike this family is that they fasten on the more recent varieties, known as Charms. They are nothing of the sort. They arose from a chance seedling in Slough, near London, in the 1930s and have the stunted regularity of a mound of dwarf asters, with even more flowers in even harsher colours. Instead, try the Cascade varieties which have long been loved in the East. Three or four plants can be trained to go a very long way, as Wisley shows. Train each plant individually on to an upright square of wire netting fixed at the back of its pot. During summer and autumn, the green shoots need to be trained on to this wire to show themselves off; extra shoots should be pinched out until you have a cascading curtain of flowers in mid-November, several feet high and wide. Two such plants would dominate any drawing room. At Wisley, the spectacular cascades are Wisley Bronze and White Bouquet, tremendous flowers for anyone who has kept off the whitefly and leaf-miners during the growing season. So much for the cultivation; now for my proposal. A Xiaolan-style festival could fill in the gap between the fireworks and the Christmas carols and, under municipal patronage, it could even attract a few new tunes of its own: 'Once in Royal Beijing City . . .' or 'We Three Mums of the Orient Are . . .' If the class structure has changed in the Pearl River delta, it has certainly altered in the home counties of England; how better to integrate new and old money than to make them both compete for honour by growing the same chrysanths? I see no problem about the musical accompaniment: the English National Opera seems only too keen to upstage old favourites and it could surely come up with some previously-loved classics, set in a municipal flower show. What, though, is in it for hard-pressed academics such as myself? Here, the Chinese seem to have found the answer. When the chrysanths had been displayed individually in their Hall of Honour, they were graded, marked and assessed by a system which, according to Dr Sui, was based on the marking conventions of the famous examinations for the Chinese civil service. Marking, testing and assessing are now the obsession of British bureaucrats but, as a school governor, I am extremely concerned that the new tier of Key Stage testers of schoolchildren have nothing to test in the winter months. How better could Key Stage testers keep up their standards out of season than by going to inspect their local council's chrysanthemums and giving them Certificates of Competence on the Chinese model? Those of you who have seen the proposed Key Stage test will appreciate that it could as well be applied to chrysanths as to comprehensives - and the proposal has an appropriate symmetry. The Chinese used to grade their plants as if they were scholars. Their festival would be a useful training ground now that we are about to grade our schoolchildren as if they were plants.</p>

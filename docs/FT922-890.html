			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Executive Cars (11): Only one way to go - US makers' plans for exports AMERICA'S Big Three car makers are waking up to the idea of exporting to Europe once more. The sales numbers are still small, but their commitments mean there is only one way to go: up. Several factors are behind the change, not the least of which is the decision by some of Japan's North American car transplants to start exporting. If Honda and Mitsubishi can sell American-made cars in Japan and Europe, so can General Motors, Ford and Chrysler. At the same time, tumbling American sales and the increasing share of the vehicle market taken by Japanese companies have left the Big Three with excess vehicle-building capacity. Exports would help fill those production lines once again. Underlying all this is America's huge imbalance in trade. Sixty per cent of last year's Dollars 66bn deficit was attributable to cars and components. The Big Three recognise they have to reduce the imbalance. Chrysler, by far the smallest of the trio, is making the most progress. It sold 44,200 vehicles in Europe last year, way ahead of the 16,000 North American imports by General Motors and 13,000 by Ford. In a market of 13.44m, they are hardly numbers which will concern sales leaders such as Volkswagen and Fiat. But US plans call for big sales increases of North American-made vehicles in Europe, and that represents a change of direction. GM and Ford have always sold handfuls of transatlantic imports alongside the cars and trucks they make locally. They never put much effort into promoting them because, historically, the policy was to build cars where they are sold. That is still very much the case - and one being followed today by Japan's car makers as they establish manufacturing and design presences in Europe. Ford's North American numbers were led by the Probe coupe, mainly in Germany as a rival to the VW Corrado and Opel Calibra. More recently, it started selling the Explorer four-wheel-drive sports-utility. The company's primary purpose is to plug gaps in Ford of Europe's model line-up. Even so, it reckons it could triple today's European sales to 50,000 by the middle of the decade. Certainly Ford's next export promises to be more significant. It is the replacement for the Probe, which goes on sale in America next month and in Germany later this year. It will not arrive in Britain until next year, but it will have right hand drive. But even Probe is not a pure Ford. It is based on the Mazda MX6 and is made in Michigan by Mazda, in which Ford is a 24 per cent shareholder. To that extent, it could be categorised as an export by a Japanese transplant in North America. General Motors makes no bones about European sales expectations for future North American models. Mr Richard Lee, the executive in charge of exports, recently said he wants them to reach 125,000 by the middle of the decade. The task seems to devolve on Saturn and a new generation minivan - the type of people-carrier which Renault popularised in Europe with the Espace. Mr 'Skip' LeFauve, president of GM's recently-formed Saturn division, has always maintained that exports must be a central part of the strategy. All that is missing so far is a date. But it will be a brave development. Saturn is a range of medium-sized saloons, coupes and estate cars which would compete directly with GM's established European brands, Opel and Vauxhall. In the main, the American companies are concentrating on model types that are not widely available in Europe, such as off-road sports-utilities and minivans. GM's new minivan, due in 1995, is expected to be sold by GM's Vauxhall dealers in Britain and by Opel in mainland Europe. In this way, GM will fill a neglected European market niche as well as its production lines in America. Chrysler's European approach has had to be different. Forced to abandon the region in 1970 by bigger troubles back home, it sold its former Rootes and Simca factories in Britain, France and Spain to Peugeot. It was a transaction which turned the French group into Europe's market leader. Chrysler may have been out of Europe for a decade but it was not idle. During the absence, it solved its financial problems, launched a vehicle which revolutionised the American market, and bought American Motors - makers of the world-famous Jeep - from Renault. The new model was the minivan. Together with the similar vehicles which GM, Ford and the Japanese were forced to bring out, Chrysler's minivan has practically killed the estate car in America. It has also become the cornerstone of Chrysler's manufacturing return to Europe. Mr Lee Iacocca, chairman, and Chancellor Franz Vranitzky of Austria were among the dignitaries who recently dedicated the Graz factory which now produces Voyagers. The enterprise, known as Eurostar, is a 50-50 joint venture with Steyr-Daimler-Puch. it will be making 50,000 Voyagers a year by 1994-95. Voyager and the Jeep ranges have spearheaded Chrysler's European sales drive. America's sudden interest in exports is not confined to Europe. It needs to sell more to Japan - and that requires making right-hand-drive vehicles. The country's car makers have until recently been reluctant to do so, although the picture is now changing. As it does, new market opportunities will open up in Britain, Australia and the many other countries around the world which drive on the left. Chrysler has already engineered some current models for right hand drive, and says all future models will be. GM and Ford are thinking along the same lines.</p>

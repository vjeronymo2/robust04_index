			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / International Company News: Thai group to buy out its Danish parent CHRISTIANI and Nielsen (Thai), the construction and engineering company, announced yesterday that its shareholders had approved a plan to buy up to 100 per cent of its Copenhagen-listed Danish parent, Christiani and Nielsen AS, for about Dollars 80m. Thailand will become the headquarters for the group, and the Thai company will control wholly-owned operations in Denmark, Germany and the UK. Mr John Millard, the Thai group's chief executive officer, said the move was logical because significant growth was occurring in Thailand and south-east Asia. Christiani and Nielsen (Thai) employs 4,500 staff and has an order book worth Dollars 270m. It expects after-tax profits of about Bt350m (Dollars 13.75m) in 1992, more than triple the 1991 profits of Bt104m. Mr Millard said that the group was 'experiencing tremendous growth at a time when many other similar businesses in Europe are experiencing flat sales because of major downturns in their respective economies.' He added: 'Our growth is being fuelled primarily from Thailand.' Mr Millard said that staff had already been deployed from UK and other operations to projects in Thailand and China. He said that this was the first time in Thailand's history that such a cross-border transaction involving two listed companies had occurred. The ailing Danish parent owns 42.17 per cent of the Thai company. The Christiani and Nielsen group has been in Thailand for 60 years - among other projects, it built the famous Democracy Monument - and has profited from the country's rapid economic growth of recent years.</p>

			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Reckitt slides on cautious outlook: Growth 'will take a while to filter through' warns toiletries group Shares in Reckitt &amp; Colman fell 25p to 627p yesterday after the household products and toiletries group delivered slightly weaker than expected interim pre-tax profits of Pounds 123.3m and a cautious trading statement. 'The tough competitive and economic conditions which affected the group's performance in the first-half year persist and are unlikely to improve in the second half,' it said. New products in core brands such as Harpic lavatory cleaner helped compensate for the flat demand Reckitt said it faced in Europe and North America. Economic growth 'will take a while to filter through to our consumer products', said Mr Vernon Sankey, chief executive. Confident of its brand strengths and outlook, Reckitt raised its interim dividend by 7.8 per cent to 6.95p a share. Fully diluted earnings were 21.8p per share against 24.62p. Adjusted for exceptional items they were 24.9p against 23.7p The pre-tax profits of Pounds 123.3m for the six months to July 2, down from Pounds 143.6m a year earlier, included a Pounds 56m charge for rationalising Reckitt's European operations and a Pounds 30m gain from the sale of its European pigments business in March. Mr Sankey said the European reorganisation, its second in five years, would generate annual cost savings of some Pounds 25m. Operating profits from continuing operations before the exceptional charge were flat at Pounds 169.9m but the profit margin rose to 16.4 per cent from 15.8 per cent, reflecting a dip in sales to Pounds 1.04bn from Pounds 1.07bn. Adjusted for sales of some minor brands and currency changes, sales were flat. Household and toiletry products showed a marginal increase in operating profits to Pounds 121.4m due mostly to new products in North America and Europe. Sales were down Pounds 29m at Pounds 724.1m. Pharmaceutical profits were down slightly at Pounds 22.2m on sales ahead 5 per cent at Pounds 107m. Mr Sankey said Reckitt was benefiting from rapid growth of non-prescription drugs. But, he added, 'we have no ambitions' to expand in the US over-the-counter market. 'It is too late and too difficult.' He declined to comment on speculation that Reckitt might bid for Eastman Kodak's household goods division. The company would continue to buy brands in household products, toiletries and pharmaceuticals and perhaps in food, he added. Reckitt's food sector reported operating profits of Pounds 23.2m, down from Pounds 34.4m including an exceptional gain of Pounds 10m a year earlier. The main weakness for Reckitt was in the UK soft drinks market. Volumes in its segment fell some 3 per cent. Net borrowings at the half-year fell to Pounds 170m from Pounds 310.7m a year earlier.

			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / Equity Markets: Tokyo - Other Markets Investors are expected to remain cautious ahead of Thursday's listing of Japan Tobacco, writes Emiko Terazono. Only about 10 per cent of the second round of subscribers are thought to have bought the stock, and brokers estimate that 60 per cent of the offered shares remain unsold. This means that unless the ministry of finance decides to unload the unsold shares on to the market on Thursday, the potential number of sellers of the stock remains lower than initial expectations. Some market participants expect that this will support investor confidence after the listing, prompting the stock market to rally. Meanwhile, investors are also expected to remain cautious if the currency market remains volatile. A further strengthening of the yen against the dollar could prompt a brief sell-off of high-technology stocks. Compiled by Michael Morgan</p>

"I do  not foresee a reduction in future," he told Asia Airlines and  Aerospace, a new trade magazine based in Kuala Lumpur.    Since soon after independence in 1965, Singapore had spent 6  percent of GDP on defence every year to "compensate for its  limited manpower and small economy", Dr Yeo said. "We consider  our defence expenditure as an investment for peace and security.  Maintaining a high level of preparedness and operational  readiness is essential to the stability and strength of our  nation and enhances our attractiveness for investment and  business."    Dr Yeo also said that Singapore would not rule out buying  Russian arms, which have been marketed only recently. While  Singapore knew little about Russian weapons, there could be some  systems that could meet the Singapore Armed Forces' [SAF] needs,  he said. "Singapore is prepared, where feasible, to explore  non-traditional arms suppliers, including the Russian defence  industries," Dr Yeo said. "This will increase the range of  advanced systems available for consideration by the SAF."    Dr Yeo also said that Singapore would do its part to help  uphold international law and order. "In line with this, the SAF  will continue to participate in UN-led international  operations." But he said that due to manpower constraints,  Singapore's contribution would always be limited.</p>

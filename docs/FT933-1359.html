			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Technology: A quicker pace - NCR's automated teller division led the competition of today, but feared for the future Jim Adamson, who runs the worldwide automated teller machine business of US multinational NCR, now part of AT&amp;T, says that when in 1990 it compared its performance with that of rival ATM manufacturers, he found the conclusions frightening. 'Our bench-marking showed that by most yardsticks we were far ahead of our competitors. And I didn't like it.' What frightened him, he says, was the knowledge that despite success, the operation which he runs from NCR's plant in Dundee was still taking as much as five years to bring products from conception to the market. Although that was sufficient to beat its current competitors, 'there is a danger in business that you only look at your present competitors,' Adamson says. 'What would happen if companies from other industries with better product innovation - such as Japanese car makers - moved into our industry?' Adamson's concern led NCR in 1991 to hire the consultants Pittiglio Rabin Todd &amp; McGrath (PRTM), who advise on operations management in both the US and Europe, to help speed up its product innovation. NCR now claims that after a painful culture change, its innovation lead times have been shortened by up to 40 per cent. NCR's ATMs were already beginning to achieve dominant market positions and by the end of 1992 some 65 per cent of the ATMs installed in Europe and 39 per cent worldwide had been made in Dundee. Last year, the plant shipped 53 per cent of all ATMs sold worldwide. This year, NCR's ATM business, worth about Dollars 1.29bn (Pounds 830m), is growing by 20 to 25 per cent, as it outpaces its biggest competitor, InterBold of the US. It has increased its Dundee workforce by 300 to 1,600. Yet the third and fourth generation NCR ATMs on which this performance is based took several years to reach the market, after a process which Adamson says was inefficient and long-winded. Product ideas originated with the marketing department, went to engineering to be designed, then on to manufacturing to be produced, before coming back to marketing. It was when the first models had been built that the customers' verdict was sought. This led to design changes which had to go through the manufacturing process. 'We didn't feel we had to get it right first time,' says Adamson. Whereas the old system proceeded serially, 'with lots of dotting back and forth between the stages,' Adamson says, under the new system, which the consultants call Pace (product and cycle-time excellence), the processes run in parallel. A core team of six or seven people is set up to handle the development of a new product, the idea for which may come from marketing, engineering, other departments or from the customer. The team includes representatives not just of engineering but of manufacturing, quality control, servicing and marketing. 'The involvement of all these disciplines means that you get individual engineers thinking through the business case from a customer's point of view,' says Adamson. 'That view comes via the marketing representative, based on regular contact with customers. 'Pace means that ideas that may seem good to engineers but don't appeal to customers are weeded out at an early stage. The involvement of the manufacturing department could mean that a feature that may be difficult to build or make the product awkward to ship emerges at an early stage,' Adamson says. The core team is monitored by the product approval committee, a permanent body which includes senior executives such as the directors of engineering, finance, quality, human resources, marketing and technology. It has to authorise funding for each phase, from the initial evaluation of the concept by the core team, through the hammering out of a design requirement, to the development phase. Adamson says that under Pace most of the hard work put into the development process by senior executives comes in the early stages. 'There's an awful lot of arguing to get through but all the different stages that used to take place along the way are compressed into a short time. That means that much less senior executive time is needed as the product comes closer to reaching the market.' Pace can mean that projects get killed at an earlier stage. Of the two pilot projects to which NCR applied Pace, one was Adamson's pet scheme for a low-cost cash dispenser. The core team evaluating it judged it not to meet customer requirements and recommended not going ahead in its original form. The decision saved Dollars 5m of development funding. 'That would never have happened in the past,' says Alison Armstrong, vice-president for self-service software systems. 'It would have been seen as cancelling a project. Now it's seen as applying R&amp;D effectively.' Adamson says: 'Pace means more freedom of speech and more freedom of action. Under the old system it was very difficult to cancel projects because we would already have spent a lot of money on them and the people involved fought for them because they were afraid they would lose their jobs. Now the core team feels that if a project is cancelled it can get on with something more worthwhile.' The other pilot project was a software package for monitoring and controlling a network of ATMs, which was reckoned to be three times as complex as the previous one from which it was derived. But whereas the earlier version took 108 weeks to bring from concept to market, the new package was developed in 65 weeks, a 40 per cent saving. However, the introduction of Pace, in which PRTM staff acted as facilitators, was traumatic, Adamson admits. 'It was a cultural change,' he says. 'We had to break down barriers between different disciplines. You had engineers saying: how we do our job is nothing to do with quality control or with production engineers.' Armstrong says that some of the most painful changes affected Adamson himself, who is quick-thinking, decisive and charismatic. 'Jim had to stop himself from taking too many decisions and leave them to the core teams.' Now Adamson only gets involved in critical business decisions, as a member of the product approval committee, rather then matters of product detail. Adamson says: 'When we were a smaller organisation, I was making all the decisions. Now I am coach and counsellor to aid decision-making.' The Pace process of product development, which PRTM had introduced to offshoots of other US multinationals before it came to NCR's self-service division at Dundee, is now being adopted byfive other divisions of NCR, and in two divisions of NCR's parent AT&amp;T.</p>

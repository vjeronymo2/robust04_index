			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Survey of South Africa (33): Missions abroad have doubled - Foreign policy If South African newspaper headlines are taken at face value, President Nelson Mandela is the diplomatic equivalent of Superman. Barely a week has gone by since the new government took office without what is presented as yet another presidential foreign policy initiative, exciting unrealistic expectations. Mr Mandela is, it seems, single-handedly reforming the Organisation of African Unity, in which newly-admitted South Africa is 'destined to play a leading role in peacekeeping and conflict resolution', according to local reports. He is much in demand. Over the past few weeks Mr Mandela has been described as 'brokering' peace efforts in Rwanda and Angola, and contemplating imposing democracy on troubled Lesotho. Thanks to President Francois Mitterrand's invitation, he will attend the next gathering of Francophone states, while the French leader's championing of South Africa placed the country 'firmly on the agenda' at last week's Group of Seven leading industrial nations' meeting in Naples. Meanwhile South Africa has rejoined the Commonwealth and looks forward to playing an active role in the Non-Aligned Movement. New ties have also been forged with Japan. Tokyo's aid package, said to be worth R4bn, will, says Mr Mandela, help to 'kick-start' the country's reconstruction and development plan. But closer examination of the package suggests it may be worth less than the initial estimates suggest. If all this is not enough, President Mandela appeared on video at President Bill Clinton's White House conference on Africa last month to lend his weight to calls for a Marshall Plan for the continent, the name given to the US-led programme to rebuild Europe after the second world war. Included in Mr Mandela's speech was an appeal for radical measures to ease Africa's external debt burden. While these initiatives - real, imagined or exaggerated - take place, one arm of foreign policy seems to be operating with its past efficiency: the state-owned arms manufacturer, Armscor. With sanctions lifted, and its activities given the endorsement of Mr Joe Modise, defence minister, officials are now lifting at least a corner of the veil of secrecy. The defence industry provides 70,000 jobs and foreign exchange, say government officials, who add defensively: 'If we didn't sell weapons, someone else would.' To be fair to Mr Mandela, he and his senior advisers have tried to play down expectations. On the one hand, Mr Mandela's integrity and moral authority makes him the acceptable voice of Africa on behalf of its many causes. At the same time, he makes clear that that he has no easy answers to offer. Advisers also point out that an effective diplomatic role is not made easier by the fact that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in the throes of reorganisation. South African missions abroad have doubled since the transition to respectability began, while new entrants to the diplomatic service have to be trained, and suitable ambassadors found to replace many of the pre-election incumbents. Meanwhile the overstretched service is still getting to grips with issues in which it has had little or no experience. These range from getting to know the OAU to the implications of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade deal, or reconciling relations with countries with whom ties were initially forged by the African National Congress, or the former government. Thus, the new South Africa has to weigh its relationship with Taiwan, one of its biggest trading partners, against recently-established official links with the People's Republic of China. The latter's trading potential is bigger, and its position as permanent member of the UN Security Council will have to be taken into account by Pretoria should South Africa have aspirations for a council seat as Africa's representative. Nominally in charge of this demanding portfolio is Mr Alfred Nzo, the foreign minister. His surprising appointment is put down to years of loyal service to the ANC. It may also be explained by the fact that policy will be shaped by Mr Mandela himself, and his senior deputy president, Mr Thabo Mbeki. As the initial euphoria and excitement dies down, South Africa's foreign policy is likely to become more cautious. Mr Aziz Pahad, the deputy foreign minister, acknowledges the dangers of taking on too much. But expectations are nevertheless high. In an interview with the Financial Times he echoes the explanation he gave to the Johannesburg Sunday Times: 'We have captured the moral high ground in nonracialism, democracy and conflict resolution to become the world leader in this area.' First of all, however, South Africa has to consolidate its success and build a stable, flourishing, democracy: 'If we don't sink, they (Africa's donors and creditors) see the hope that the region won't sink, and if the region doesn't sink, they see some hope of a breakthrough in the development of other parts of Africa.' Mr Pahad hopes that foreign investors do not ignore South Africa's neighbours: 'If you don't have mutually advantageous regional development, illegal immigrants will come to South Africa and, given that our borders are so big, we will not be able to prevent it.'</p>

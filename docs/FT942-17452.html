			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / Sophistication and a sort of stability come late to Soweto: On a visit to South Africa's most famous township, Patti Waldmeir sounded surprising opinions and sensed an indomitable spirit SoWeTo stands for South Western Townships. It is less a name than a set of geographical co-ordinates for the greatest labour camp created in the name of apartheid. But even apartheid was not strong enough to suppress the life force of this township-city of 3m people, which sprawls near Johannesburg and now, on the eve of the new South Africa, is making a rapid, if belated, entry to the twentieth century. Within days, cellular telephones will be installed in Soweto's famous 'black taxis', the minibuses which catapult hundreds of thousands of commuters the 30km to Johannesburg each day. Soweto's first luxury hotel opened recently, its 28 rooms the only ones available in this city the size of Chicago. In Soweto, you can play golf, sweat through aerobics, get your hair straightened, and give your money away to accountants, dentists, lawyers, doctors (and drug dealers). In other words, you can live in Soweto - just what apartheid's geographers were most determined to prevent. They wanted to design a township so unpleasant and inconvenient that no-one would wish to settle there, thus keeping Johannesburg safe for whites. For decades, shopping, drinking, getting keys cut or clothes cleaned was in effect illegal in Soweto. Licences were granted for only a tiny handful of shops. Others operated illegally but were often shut down by police raids. There were almost no amenities - there are few enough today - and transport to town was slow and inconvenient, before deregulation in the 1980s led to the thriving 'black taxi' and its more flexible service. So Soweto rose above apartheid's design to become the most sophisticated black community in South Africa. That sophistication is not just economic, it is political. During a recent visit to the township, random conversations with pedestrians and shop-owners turned up few who said they were going to vote for the African National Congress. Opinion polls give the ANC at least 60 per cent of the national vote so this was surprising. Perhaps it is only natural to find more political heterogeneity in a community which is older, more settled, and more middle-class than almost any other black township in South Africa. Unlike many of the country's other townships, thrown together as millions moved to the cities illegally in the 1980s, urbanisation in Soweto goes back three or four generations. People there have left behind the rigid tribal life of rural areas, where individual preference gives way before communal choice. They make up their own minds and are well-educated enough to believe that their vote is secret. Political tolerance is a fragile flower but here, as elsewhere, the ruling National Party is at least able to operate an office in Soweto (on the floor just above the ANC headquarters, in one of the townships's only office buildings). At the Alex Hair Salon, where Mr Alfred Motshabi, the manager, is offering a pre-election special on hair care, the NP has a natural constituency of professionals and African yuppies. Mr Motshabi says that, from overhearing his clients' conversations, he would guess that only a small minority will vote ANC and many will vote NP. At the Blue Fountain, Soweto's most famous nightclub, Mr Jeffrey Moloi (son and partner of Mr Godfrey Moloi, the owner) says many of the bar's patrons will vote for the National Party. 'I overheard a client say the other day that (President F W) de Klerk has built bridges in South Africa - what has (ANC leader Nelson) Mandela built?' Mr Toby Makwakwa tells a more sinister story of political heterogeneity. He owns a string of businesses, including two car dealerships, a fast food shop, a spares and vehicle repair centre, and has a share of a cellular telephone consortium. He says he pays protection money to all the political parties (except the National Party, which is probably too frightened to demand it). 'We give,' he says simply, to the ANC, the black-supremacist Pan-Africanist Congress, the Azanian People's Organisation (which is so radical it is boycotting the elections). 'We must give or we'll be put on the black list and then they'll vandalise our business,' he explains, though noting with pleasure that this political levy has come down sharply since the chaos of the late-1980s when Soweto was part of the great revolt against apartheid - yet another sign of returning stability. Apartheid's legacy is apparent, even so. Gesturing at the top-of-the-range executive cars crowded onto the showroom floor of Toby's Ford, Toby admits: 'People have certain perceptions that, if you buy a car from a black businessman maybe it will be defective. But those are just perceptions,' he adds, saying he has no intention of leaving Soweto, though he clearly could afford to do so. Mr Jeffrey Moloi agrees: 'If we all move to Sandton (a posh white suburb), Soweto will be dead. Who's going to lead the people we leave behind?' Anyway, he adds, he likes Soweto: 'It's big and so many things are happening. We have so many famous people in Soweto.' Mr Moloi has ample reason to like Soweto: his family has major business interests and his father recently built a R2m (Pounds 400,000) house there. The endorsement of Ms Blessing Mhlongo, shop assistant and supporter of the Pan-Africanist Congress is simpler: 'It's nice, Soweto'. She only hopes that a post-apartheid government will make it just that little bit nicer.</p>

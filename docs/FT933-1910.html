			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / Crisis in Russia: Yeltsin will stand or fall on reforms Mr Boris Yeltsin's decision to tackle his parliamentary opponents head-on was widely seen yesterday as the moment when he finally staked his political survival on the success of his economic reforms, Edward Balls reports. An observer close to the reform effort, who would not be named, said international financial institutions were not surprised Mr Yeltsin had acted because it had become clear the two sides' failure to compromise on constitutional differences could not be sustained. If these could be settled, Russia could press on with economic reform.</p>

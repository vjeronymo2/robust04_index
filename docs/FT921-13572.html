			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / International Company News: Thyssen Edelstahl decline slowed by cost-cutting JOB cuts and other cost-savings reduced annual losses at Thyssen Edelstahl last year by more than 50 per cent, Mr Karlheinz Rosener, chairman of the special steels subsidiary of the Thyssen group said yesterday. However, since there were no firm signs of improvements in markets, he added, more economies would be needed this year. The company was already making losses in the first quarter of the current year, he said, because of noticeable weaknesses in demand from machinery and motor car makers. Sales in the year ended September 1991 fell 14 per cent to DM3.3bn (Dollars 2.08bn), producing a loss of DM63m, compared with a DM176m deficit last time on turnover of DM3.9bn. Confirming a plan for the company to merge with Thyssen Stahl, part of the parent group, Mr Rosener hinted that when that was complete later this year, the group might resume 'co-operation' talks in the special steels business with Krupp, another leading German maker. A first round of negotiations was broken off just before Christmas. Long products, mainly engineering steel, which account for 38 per cent of the company's sales and 56 per cent of volume deliveries, had suffered particularly badly from 'recessive tendencies' which first hit the group in the middle of 1990. Turnover in the sector, which includes stainless and tool steels, fell 22 per cent during the year. Prices of steel for construction and ball-bearings fell by up to 10 per cent. Economies last year included an 8 per cent reduction in the workforce, halving overtime hours worked, short-time in some plants and the retraining and transfer to other Thyssen group companies of 256 people. Thyssen Edelstahl was currently reducing costs in central administration by about 30 per cent, Mr Rosener said, and more job losses were inevitable this year.</p>

			<p><P> December 14, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL GIRLS' PREVIEW;  </P> <P> MORNINGSIDE MAINTAINS NO. 1 RANKING  </P> <P> Lisa Leslie and Coach Frank Scott have moved on, but Inglewood Morningside  still is the team to beat during the 1990-91 girls' basketball season.  </P> <P> Leslie, who was named state player of the year the last two seasons, is a  freshman at USC, and Scott, who led the Monarchs to two consecutive Division I  state championships, is in his first season as a Trojan assistant.  </P> <P> Even so, Ron Randle, Morningside's first-year coach, should have no problem  continuing the Monarchs' winning ways, and they hold the top position in The  Times' Southern California preseason poll.  </P> <P> 1. MORNINGSIDE  </P> <P> Southern Section Division I  </P> <P> Pioneer League. Last Season (32-3)  </P> <P> Opposing coaches may not pull their teams off the court at halftime trailing,  102-24, as South Torrance Coach Gil Ramirez did last season, but they may want  to. Leslie is gone, but the Monarchs have their other starters back. Leading  the way will be Princess Murray, a 5-foot-10 senior guard, and Janet Davis, a  6-3 junior forward. Akiba Flanagan and Tyesha Whiting, who combined to average  15 points and 13 rebounds a game last season, also return.  </P> <P> Morningside will not have to wait long to find out how good it is. The Monarchs  will be tested early in the Santa Barbara Tournament of Champions starting  Wednesday. The key for Morningside may well be the play of underclassmen Tina  Thompson, a 6-1 sophomore, and Tameka Kirby, a 5-9 freshman.  </P> <P> 2. CHINO  </P> <P> Southern Section Division I  </P> <P> Baseline League. Last Season: 27-3  </P> <P> Coach Joe Murillo has won three Southern Section titles, and this season's  Chino team may be his best. The Cowgirls will be led by Beth Beers, a 6-3  center; Francine Moreno, a 5-8 junior, and Michelle Kahler, a 5-6 point guard.  </P> <P> Last season, Chino lost to Morningside, 75-48, in the Southern Section 5-AA  Division semifinals, but look for a better showing from the Cowgirls this  season with the addition of sophomore Amee Pina and junior Keri Collins. Chino  will also be in the Santa Barbara Tournament of Champions.  </P> <P> 3. VENTURA BUENA  </P> <P> Southern Section Division I  </P> <P> Channel League. Last Season: 26-2.  </P> <P> After winning its first 26 games last season, Buena lost to Newhall Hart in the  Southern Section 5-A Division final and then lost to Morningside in the first  round of the state playoffs. This season, Coach Joe Vaughan's Bulldogs are deep  again, with guard Mia Palkie, an All-Southern Section performer last season,  and Leanne Ishikawa, who showed improvement last summer.  </P> <P> Vaughan, who began the season with a 342-31 record, also will have returning  starter Jennifer Wells and sophomore center April Buck. The Bulldogs will be  tested on Jan. 18, when they play host to the nation's top-rated team, Christ  the King of New York.  </P> <P> 4. LOS ANGELES WASHINGTON  </P> <P> City Section 4-A Division  </P> <P> Southern League. Last Season: 29-4  </P> <P> Coach Phil Chase no longer has All-City cousins Detra Lockhart and Remitha  Houston, who graduated, but back is Charisse Sampson, who is considered one of  the nation's top juniors. Sampson has started for Washington since her freshman  year and last season averaged 16 points and 14 rebounds a game. Last season,  the Generals won their second consecutive City title, but lost in the state  tournament to Morningside.  </P> <P> 5. LYNWOOD  </P> <P> Southern Section Division I  </P> <P> San Gabriel Valley League.  </P> <P> Last Season: 28-3.  </P> <P> Coach Maurice Roberson has three key starters returning, Kim Barfield, a 5-10  forward who averaged 16 points and 12 rebounds last season; Sheronda Colbert,  5-11 center, and Bridgette Polk, a 5-9 guard. Last season, the Knights lost to  Morningside in the Southern Section 5-AA final.  </P> <P> 6. PALOS VERDES  </P> <P> Southern Section Division III  </P> <P> Ocean League. Last Season: 29-6.  </P> <P> The Sea Kings will be loaded this season with the addition of transfers Kristen  Mulligan, who averaged 22.1 points last season for Santa Margarita, and Jeffra  Gausepohl, a 6-5 junior from Pennsylvania. Coach Wendall Yoshida also has five  starters back from last season, headed by Monique Morehouse, a 6-3 junior. The  Sea Kings also will have highly regarded freshman guard Mimi McKinney.  </P> <P> 7. LAKEWOOD  </P> <P> Southern Section Division I  </P> <P> Moore League. Last Season: 20-5.  </P> <P> It is not difficult to guess where Lakewood's strength will be this season.  Coach Dow Larson has one of the best inside combinations in the state in 6-2  Melissa Gower, who averaged 20 points and 13 rebounds last season, and 6-1  Charon Johnson, who averaged 16 points. Akia Hardy and Keshana Ladet will  control the backcourt for the Lancers.  </P> <P> 8. GAHR  </P> <P> Southern Section Division II  </P> <P> San Gabriel Valley League.  </P> <P> Last Season: 19-6.  </P> <P> With the addition of Allison Arredondo, who transferred from Los Alamitos, Gahr  figures to be a force. Coach Tom Pryor also has his five starters from last  season. Arredondo, a 6-1 junior, who averaged 20 points and 10 rebounds last  season and will join Shemekia Brown, a 6-2 center who averaged nine points and  seven rebounds last season; Kris Waldorf, a junior guard; and Cindy Alen, a 6-0  forward.  </P> <P> 9. OXNARD CHANNEL ISLANDS  </P> <P> Southern Section Division I  </P> <P> Marmonte League. Last Season: 23-7.  </P> <P> Center Sal Tauau, a 6-foot senior who averaged 12 points and 13 rebounds last  season, is the best of four returning starters for Coach Ryle Lynch-Cole.  Another senior to be counted on is Candis Carper, a 5-11 forward who averaged  13 points and 10 rebounds last season.  </P> <P> 10. BREA-OLINDA  </P> <P> Southern Section Division II  </P> <P> Orange League. Last Season: 33-1.  </P> <P> Last Season, the Wildcats were the Southern Section's top team after defeating  Morningside and Washington during the regular season but lost in the state  Division III final. Coach Mark Trakh lost his top guards, Aimee McDaniel and  Tammy Blackburn, who led the Wildcats to a 63-3 record and two Southern Section  titles, to graduation, but back are Jinelle Williams and Jody Anton.  </P> <P> 11. CARSON  </P> <P> City Section 4-A Division  </P> <P> Pacific League. Last Season: 22-7  </P> <P> Last season, Carson was no match for Washington in the City 4-A semifinals,  losing, 73-34, but the Colts have six players back from that team. Coach Jay  Park's top player is 6-1 Bernice Alafua, who averaged 19 points last season.  Bernetta James and RayJanette Lampkins will start in the backcourt.  </P> <P> 12. REDLANDS  </P> <P> Southern Section Division I  </P> <P> Citrus Belt League. Last Season: 23-5.  </P> <P> Coach Gary Luebbers has four returning four starters, including Kim Burr, who  averaged 11 points and seven rebounds a game last season, and Penny Porter, who  averaged 13 points. Guard Heather Michaelis, who averaged 10 points and seven  assists, will lead the team at point guard.  </P> <P> 13. COSTA MESA ESTANCIA  </P> <P> Southern Section Division III  </P> <P> Pacific Coast League. Last Season: 14-13.  </P> <P> Last season, Estancia rallied in the playoffs to reach the Southern Section  semifinals, largely on the play of Patrice Lumpkins. Coach Lisa McNamee again  has Lumpkins, who averaged 13 points, to go along with Melody Earle, who  averaged 15.3, and Monique Sweet.  </P> <P> 14. LOMPOC  </P> <P> Southern Section Division III  </P> <P> Northern League. Last Season: 21-4.  </P> <P> All-Southern Section Nicki Manzo looms as the main force for Coach Sherman  Hansen's Braves this season. Manzo, a 6-5 senior who averaged 24.3 points and  14.6 rebounds last season, will team with Twilla Sims, who won the State  300-meter hurdles title two years ago, and freshman Kim Wuiest.  </P> <P> 15. SANTA MARIA ST. JOSEPH  </P> <P> Southern Section Division IV  </P> <P> Los Padres League. Last Season: 28-4  </P> <P> Coach Ed Torres has his entire team from last season and that team outscored  postseason opponents by an average of 37.5 points in reaching the state  Division IV final. The Knights will be led by the McConnell twins, Amy, who  averaged 16.7 points and 16.7 rebounds; and Anna, who averaged 16.5 points and  6.3 assists. Claudia Nunez and Jennifer Anaya will also play key roles for the  Knights.  </P></p>

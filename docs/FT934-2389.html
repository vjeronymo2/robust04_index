			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Rebel holders threaten Fife Rebel shareholders at Fife Indmar yesterday threatened to force a financial crisis at the Scottish engineering and distribution company if they failed to win control at an extraordinary meeting this week. Mr Charles McDonald, a non-executive director and rebel leader, said he would cash in Pounds 300,000 of loan notes and probably sell his 8.5 per cent stake - the largest non-institutional holding - if moves to oust the board were voted down. 'They'll have a lot of shares coming on to the market. The price could collapse,' he said yesterday. The warning followed allegations of costly acquisitions and poor financial management at Fife. Mr Gavin Hepburn, chairman, has dismissed the claims and accused the rebels of publishing inaccurate information about the group. He also held out the prospect of a threefold increase in the final dividend to 2p if the current board remained in control. The rebels yesterday pledged to match Mr Hepburn's offer and said they would invest an extra Pounds 1m in the company. Mr McDonald said he had the backing of more than 20 per cent of the private investors, although institutions, which control a total of 45.7 per cent of the shares, have not yet signalled their intentions.</p>

			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / Railtrack urges staff to increase pressure on RMT to stop strikes Railtrack is appealing directly today to all its 12,000 employees, urging them to contact the RMT transport union to demand the suspension of a planned 72 hours of disruption by signalling staff. The strikes are due to start at midnight on Thursday, affecting Friday, and continue next Monday and Tuesday. Saturday and Sunday services should run normally. The state-owned company that runs the network also urged the RMT leadership to reballot its signalling staff on the latest pay productivity offer. The move was designed to increase the pressure on the union's executive to return to talks to end the dispute, now entering its ninth week. Railtrack's bulletin to all its staff asks them to call the union's London headquarters to express their views. It said: 'Let us have a negotiated settlement to end the dispute. We have made a commitment to negotiate until we reach a settlement. Will the union do the same? Ask them.' The RMT transport union executive committee is being urged by the union's full-time officials today to consider reopening negotiations with Railtrack. The officials believe they have won enough clarification from Railtrack on its present offer to suggest an improvement can be made immediately in the basic pay rates of the staff through a consolidation of half the proposed 6 per cent supplement that is already on the table. This would be in addition to a proposed earnings rise, backdated to April 4, of 7.2 per cent composed of a productivity-linked increase of up to 4.7 per cent on top of a 2.5 per cent basic pay rise already agreed. The possibility of a return to talks was glimpsed on Friday when Railtrack chairman Mr Bob Horton suggested that the company's pay restructuring package for signalling staff could be reshaped. He suggested consolidating into basic rates for overtime and shift premiums some of the proposed 6 per cent supplement. Railtrack, however, has still not put this proposal into writing. The RMT executive might expect to have formal confirmation on the proposed consolidation before going back to the conciliation service Acas. But Railtrack's appeal today, and its behaviour over the past few days since the RMT's signalling supervisors rejected joining in the dispute after a decisive ballot vote, suggests the company is ready to be flexible. 'There are grounds to go forward,' says today's bulletin to Railtrack staff. As well as the immediate 7.2 per cent increase, Railtrack said last night that the offer also involves a final restructuring deal by October involving a further rise, plus improved holidays and sick pay. In addition, some Pounds 50m has been put aside in the railways pension fund to meet the cost of the increased pension benefits the signalling staff can expect to gain if the final settlement is agreed by October 1.</p>

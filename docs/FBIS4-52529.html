			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, May 11 (YONHAP) -- Russia threatens to  reconsider its policy of cooperating with South Korea over the  North Korean loggers' issue if South Korea tries to politically  use the question or an overheated atmosphere keeps going in  South Korea over the loggers' issue as now.    Sources at the Russian Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday that  if such a trend goes on in South Korea, Russia may totally  reconsider its basic stand toward the question.    Russia earlier gave the word that it would cooperate with  South Korea in resettling in South Korea those North Korean  loggers who remain stranded in Russia after escaping from North  Korea-run logging yards in Siberia.    The sources said the recent series of South Korean press  reports on North Korean loggers were not factual and, besides,  the Russian Government has been placed in a highly awkward  position at home and abroad due to such reports.    "We have invited the South Korean Government's attention to  this aspect several times in the past," they said.    The sources said Russia told Seoul that if South Korea,  through its press, continues to raise clamor about the loggers  issue, Russia may make an aboutface in its basic stand over the  loggers' resettlement in South Korea.    An atmosphere, they said, is being fostered among Russia's  security organizations for a change in Russia's policy over the  loggers.    "Because of such an air, inter-office talks on procedural  matters related to the loggers' resettlement in South Korea are  having a hard going," they added.    Russian experts in Korean affairs, too, said the Russian  Government is highly dissatisfied with the way the South Korean  Government handles the loggers' issue.    They did not rule out the danger that after President Kim  Yong- sam's visit to Russia, South Korea-Russia relations may be  dragged into a delicate current.    "It is possible that an extremely small number of North  Korean loggers could be sent to South Korea in a symbolic  gesture before President Kim's visit to Moscow," they said.    "But, if an overheated atmosphere is created in South Korea  by giving, for instance, a hero's welcome to the loggers to the  detriment of Russia's position, there would possibly be no  further flight of loggers to South Korea."    Meanwhile, those North Korean loggers stranded in Russia  have  cut off their contacts with the South Korean Embassy in Moscow  following Seoul's announcement of a policy to accept them.    It is believed that some of the loggers might have been  arrested by North Korean secret agents.</p>

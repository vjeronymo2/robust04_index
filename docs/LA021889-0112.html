			<p><P> February 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST : LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P>  METRO RAIL'S START PUSHED BACK AGAIN  </P> <P> Southern California Rapid Transit District officials announced Friday a further  delay in the start of Metro Rail service because of soil conditions that have  slowed excavation.  </P> <P> The first day of Metro Rail service, which had previously been postponed, was  scheduled for Jan. 4, 1993, but RTD General Manager Alan F. Pegg said in a  statement that "unanticipated factors" have caused additional delays.  </P> <P> Pegg said the discovery of contaminated soil and unsuitable ground conditions  slowed excavation near Union Station and between 4th and 7th streets in  downtown Los Angeles. That, coupled with past delays in acquiring property, has  led officials to postpone the opening date of the $1.25-billion first phase of  the project.  </P> <P> A new opening date will be announced "as soon as possible," he said.  </P> <P> RTD officials earlier estimated that the cost of realigning the subway to avoid  the pocket of hazardous soil near Union Station would add an additional $4.2  million to the project's price tag.  </P></p>

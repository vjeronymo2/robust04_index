In fact  there was quite a lot of the old Republican gunslinger in the  first official State of the Union address by the self-proclaimed  "new kind of Democrat."    The call-to-arms for a better America, with or without the  assistance of Congress, and the brandishing of his pen as he  threatened to veto any healthcare legislation that did not  provide universal insurance coverage were borrowed from the  Reagan handbook. So too were the acknowledgement of ordinary  (and not so ordinary) people in the public galleries and the  artful seating at either side of Mrs Hillary Clinton of Jack  Smith, head of General Motors, and Lane Kirkland, the trade  union leader.    Critics might also complain that the 64-minute speech was  too  long, yet short on new proposals, especially on the revived  promise to "end welfare as we know it." Foreigners might lament  that its external passage was both perfunctory and predictable  and Republicans that the president keeps stealing their clothes.    But reservations must be placed in context. The State of the  Union address offers all presidents a stage and -- for a  Democrat, old or new, welcomed by a Democratic Congress -- an  audience guaranteed to applaud often and loudly. And it found  Mr Clinton in vintage missionary form on his favourite subject,  domestic reform. The country, he concluded in ringing tones, "is  growing stronger but it must be stronger still."    It was tough for the opposition to muster an effective  immediate response. Senator Bob Dole, the Republican leader,  speaking woodenly from his office without the benefit of  partisan cheering, could only proclaim that there was no  healthcare crisis, and complain about higher taxes.    Potentially far more revealing, though still to be  approached  with a degree of cynicism, was the reaction of Congressman Newt  Gingrich of Georgia, the firebrand conservative. "There is a  potential, if this speech was sincere, for a remarkable  coalition that could pass a lot of stuff," especially on crime  and welfare. He added approvingly that Mr Clinton was now  talking his kind of language.    This, indeed, was the political message of the address. Mr  Clinton drew his line in the sand, insisted that an improving  economy was no excuse for delaying more reform and gave the  distinct impression that he did not care from which side of the  political aisle he derived support for his crusade. But he  warned, too, that the body politic was ultimately accountable to  the public -- "those who hold our feet to the fire."    Americans, he said, would not heed the siren songs of the  special vested interests and the "naysayers who fear we will not  be equal to the challenges of our time and who misread our  history, our heritage and even today's headlines."    There were micro-political messages, too. The president's  promise to bring in soon substantive proposals to change the  welfare system and explicitly to link this with healthcare  reform was a clear nod in the direction of Senator Daniel  Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat who chairs the Senate  finance committee.    The senator, an intellectual, if temperamental, original in  this Congress, has become miffed with the administration. He  has declared, like Senator Dole, that there is no healthcare  crisis and threatened to make trouble for the health proposals  if his welfare hobby horse was relegated in priority -- which is  precisely what the White House intended at the start of this  year.    At least he was satisfied with Mr Clinton's commitment on  Tuesday night, though as the president went on to expound with  much greater passion on the imperative of healthcare reform he  can have been left in little doubt where the Clinton heart lies.    But this, too, had a political need. The momentum for  changes in healthcare, accelerated by the rapturously received  presidential address to Congress last September, has slowed over  the last two months. Other issues such as Nafta, gun control  and Mr Clinton's European trip have intruded while the insurance  and medical professions have begun to launch effective  propaganda campaigns. It had become incumbent on Mr Clinton to  regain the initiative.    His ecumenical side was also in evidence in the coda to his  address on crime and on the responsibility of individuals to  make communities safer.    Much of what he said appeals to conservatives -- mandatory  sentencing for violent offenders, more police on the streets,  the restoration of family values -- but some, specifically the  calls for ever tighter gun control, does not.    Violent crime is now a perennial political issue. Every  president since Lyndon Johnson has attacked it and Congress  loves to debate it, though the effect of the efforts of both may  be questioned, not least because conservatives and liberals have  rarely agreed on the right prescriptions.    But at least the Senate last year passed, by 95 votes to  four, an omnibus crime bill that now awaits action by the House,  while both chambers approved waiting limits for purchasers of  handguns. This measure was now the Brady Law, Mr Clinton said  with pride as he clapped Mr James Brady, the former presidential  press secretary, who from his wheelchair in the galleries  proudly waved his walking stick back in return.    There is always a risk of overloading Congress, especially  in  the run-up to midterm elections. It is possible now that  fixation with crime will make harder action on health and  welfare reform both immensely complicated and controversial, as  well as other items on the president's heavy agenda such as  worker retraining, campaign finance reform, more controls on  lobbyists and the creation of an information superhighway.    But, from his Tuesday night pulpit, Mr Clinton was brooking  no delay. "Our deepest and most profound problems" could not be  left to "petty political fighting." If words were all--and he  used them very well--he would be home and dry. But not  yesterday, as his doctors ordered him to rest a voice that  barely lasted the 64 minutes.</p>

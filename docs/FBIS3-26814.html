Consequently, the development of  private business made substantial headway. In 1993, 2,500 new  independent business operators and over 40 private enterprises  with registered capital of more than 13 million yuan were set up  in Tibet, topping those of 1992 by 2.2 times and 2.3 times,  respectively.    The development of independent and private businesses used  to  be quite slow in Tibet, primarily because of relevant  authorities' excessive controls. Last year, industrial and  commercial authorities in Tibet gave top priority [fang zai shou  wei] to the development of independent and private businesses.  Making continual efforts to emancipate their minds, change  their mindset, and free themselves from worries, they drew up  preferential policies and measures for supporting the  development of independent and private businesses.    These policies include simplifying registration and  licensing  formalities. Anyone can apply for an operating license as long  as he has an ID card and a letter of recommendation from  relevant authorities; and all applications are immediately  processed without delay. Meanwhile, the scope of operations was  also broadened. Local independent operators as well as those  from other parts of the country were allowed to engage in  wholesale or retail trading of whatever commodities the state  had decontrolled. Surplus personnel which government organs,  enterprises, and institutions were to replace were permitted to  take up second vocations. Peasants and herdsmen were allowed to  trade their agricultural, sideline, and livestock products in  cities without paying management charges or business taxes.  Local and nonlocal independent operators were encouraged to  provide long-distance delivery services. Meanwhile, other  relevant departments also changed their old ways of doing things  by abolishing irrational levies and providing services which  independent and private businesses needed for their development.    These improvements and effective measures have expedited the  rapid development of independent and private businesses in  Tibet. Last year, Tibet's independent and private businesses  paid more than 20,000 yuan in taxes to the state.</p>

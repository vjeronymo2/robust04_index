			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Clinton gives Gatt pledge to Major PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday sought to reassure European leaders that the new US administration would not retreat into protectionism by telling Mr John Major that he would put a 'real effort' into a successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round of world trade talks. After a first face-to-face encounter between the two leaders at the White House dominated by trade issues and Bosnia, Mr Clinton offered also a public commitment to preserve the so-called special relationship between London and Washington. Speaking after their talks, the president brushed aside suggestions that his relations with Mr Major had been soured by Conservative help offered to Mr George Bush's presidential campaign. He joked that British Home Office files dating from his student days in England had remained secret. Earlier Mr Major had dismissed suggestions that relations between Washington and London would be damaged by the arrival of a Democratic administration. He said differences between the two governments were 'tiny' compared to their shared interests. To the relief of his guest, Mr Clinton appeared willing to play down, in public at least, the significance of his plans to send an emissary to Northern Ireland to investigate the potential for a peace settlement. He insisted that the US was keen to play a 'constructive role' in promoting a political settlement. Earlier, potential for friction on Ulster had been underlined by a demand from more than 50 Democratic members of Congress that President Clinton raise with Mr Major what they termed 'human rights abuses' by the security forces in the province. Two senior senators - Mr Edward Kennedy and Mr Daniel Moynihan - signed letters sent to President Clinton calling for the administration to play an active role in protecting the minority Catholic population. Mr Major, speaking at a joint White House press conference, said that the human rights abuses that concerned him were those inflicted by the terrorists, often on innocent civilians. But he left open the possibility that in a second meeting with the president over dinner last night the two would agree on the terms for an Ulster fact-finding mission by a senior US politician. The prime minister was visibly cheered by Mr Clinton's public commitment that he 'would put a real effort into a successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round. Mr Clinton, underlining the importance of close co-operation between the US, Japan and Europe to prevent a further contraction of the world economy, added he was 'very hopeful' the negotiations would succeed. Senior British officials said they expected the administration to underpin that urgency by extending for the so-called fast-track procedures for congressional approval of a Gatt deal. Neither leader, however, offered any hint of an early solution to the disputes between the US and Europe over Airbus subsidies, US tariffs on steel and Washington's plans for higher duties on imports of sports utility vehicles. Mr Clinton's plan to air-drop supplies into eastern Bosnia was publicly endorsed by Mr Major. Despite private reservations in London about the practicalities of such an operation, Mr Major called it an 'imaginative' contribution to the peace effort.

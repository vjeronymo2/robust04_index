			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As stated in the NPRM, persons needing to be appropriately  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipped are railroad employees other than a train crewmember, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> others acting on behalf of the railroad, who flag highway traffic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at grade crossings with malfunctioning warning systems. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement that persons be appropriately equipped does not apply  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to train crewmembers who dismount from a locomotive to flag the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> train through a crossing in an emergency situation, or to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> uniformed law enforcement officers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Final Rule <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The definition of ``appropriately equipped flagger'' is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adopted as proposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ``Credible report of system malfunction.'' <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  As proposed, ``credible report of system malfunction'' means  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific information regarding a malfunction at an identified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> highway-rail grade crossing, supplied by a railroad employee, law  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enforcement officer, highway traffic official, or an employee of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a public agency acting in an official capacity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> APTA and LIRR stated that given the high frequency of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commuter rail operations, commuter railroads consider all reports  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of malfunction as credible and respond accordingly. The American  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Trucking Associations, Inc. (ATA) objected to the definition of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``credible report'' as too narrow. The ATA believes that reports  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from individual citizens should be given the same weight by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> railroad as reports from railroad employees and the police. FRA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believes that a reporting system in which citizens notify their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> local police or highway department of malfunctions will be more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efficient. Providing this initial screening process will reduce  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> frivolous or fraudulent notifications in which members of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public may attempt to harass a railroad or individual railroad  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employee. Additionally, as discussed below in the analysis of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;234.101, certain situations requiring repair or adjustment of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the warning system do not trigger a railroad response under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;&sect;234.105 and 234.107. Although those situations, such as dirty  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> roundels, a burnt out bulb, a broken reflector, or a broken gate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> arm tip, although important, are not the type of situations in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which the railroad should be expected to take the actions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required under this rule, it is likely that such reports would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> made to the railroad. Providing an initial screening process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will better enable a railroad to quickly respond to those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> situations which safety factors clearly require the speedy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> response.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FRA, of course, has no objection to railroads acting on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reports from individuals and, indeed, as we stated in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preamble to the NPRM, ``we expect that railroads will, as they  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have traditionally done, investigate reports of malfunctions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> received from the public. After determining the accuracy of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> report a railroad would then take appropriate action in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accordance with regulations.'' The rules issued today do not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prohibit a railroad from adopting internal rules that would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> trigger specific responses to an individual's complaint, but  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would only mandate the required responses to reports from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``official'' sources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FRA is including within the definition of ``credible report''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information generated by an automatic reporting device. FRA has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered this inclusion in light of possible ``scope of notice''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> problems. However, after consideration, FRA is of the opinion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that even without this clarifying language, railroads would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to respond to such reports under the rule as proposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 234.101 mandates rules requiring employees to report  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instances of malfunctions. The employee responsible for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitoring such automatic devices must report such malfunctions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under section 234.101. Such reports are within the definition of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``credible report.'' By adding ``generated by an automatic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reporting device'' to the definition, FRA will avoid any confusion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the industry as to what is expected when automatic reporting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> devices are used.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In a comment related to credible reports, the ATA further  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommended that railroads be required to post at the crossing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the railroad's name, crossing identification number, and a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> telephone number for reporting malfunctions similar to the system  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> now in place in Texas. The railroads have cooperated in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establishing such systems in three States (Texas, Delaware and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Connecticut), and FRA is finalizing a report reviewing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> results of the Texas program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FRA agrees that establishment of a notification system is a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> desirable objective. The Department's Rail-Highway Grade  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Crossing Action Plan specifies that this issue will be further  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> examined through a special safety inquiry.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Public/private cooperation is needed to make this type of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system workable. It is important that initial notification go to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a public authority or an entity operating on behalf of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public. This procedure helps prevent the misuse of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notification system, while providing immediate notice to public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authorities where steps should be taken to protect highway  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> traffic pending the railroad response. Where citizens making  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reports do not note the inventory number or it is not posted due  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to vandalism, knowledge of the street or highway system may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary to identification of the railroad company and specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> crossing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

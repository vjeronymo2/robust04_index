			<p>CSO     [Text] The Government has been quick to respond to the  message of the embarrassing non(Euro)-issue of VSNL [expansion  not given]: the market will hammer a bargain if equity-related  offerings bunch to add up to a mega draft on investible funds.  But for the saturation of the `India portfolio' abroad by  numerous GDR flotations, VSNL would not perhaps have cut a sorry  figure. So, after abolishing capital issues control at home, the  Government has decided to regulate the rush of issues flooding  the Euromarket in search of cheap funds. From now on, a company  based in India can tap the Euromarket once in 12 months; not  more than two Euro issues will be permitted to groups during  this interval; and permission to tap the Euromarket will have to  be used up within the stipulated quarter. Such grooming  obviously clears the way for VSNL's re-entry into the  Euromarket. However, it would be churlish to decry the entry  regulations as interventionism, unbecoming of a regime that has  donned the mantle of liberalisation. Sequencing Euroissues is  essential for decent realisations.    Though no formal cap has been placed, the size of Euroissues  is now related to the end-uses of funds raised abroad. Besides  capital goods imports and approved investments abroad -- both  need funding in foreign exchange -- Eurofunds can be used to  purchase domestic plant and equipment as also buildings. Foreign  sourcing of funds will thus not pre-empt domestic suppliers. If  the latter are given deemed export treatment, domestic sourcing  of plant and equipment with low-cost funds from abroad will get  a fillip. Another permitted end-use is repayment of foreign  borrowings, either before the due date or on schedule. This is  eminently sensible as it facilitates the replacement of high  cost borrowings with alien risk capital.    The new policy provides an escape from high domestic  interest  rates. It will help to reduce, not wholly but significantly,  dependence on high cost domestic long-term funds (supporting  investment) with cheap capital from abroad. However, it is the  public sector enterprises that can freely access the Euromarket  with equity-related instruments under the privatisation policy  of reducing government ownership of equity from 100 per cent to  51 per cent. Most large private sector enterprises, in which the  equity stake of the Indian controlling interest is generally  small, are wary of equity passing into foreign hands. This  problem has been mitigated, but not contained, by the new  policy. It allows the use of 15 per cent of Euro proceeds for,  inter alia, corporate restructuring. But there is no way of  precluding the acquisition of new equity from Euroissues by the  principals of foreign institutional investors (FIIs) based in  India. To contain the take-over threat, the Government must  reduce the ceiling on FII holdings in India from the current  high of 24 per cent.</p>

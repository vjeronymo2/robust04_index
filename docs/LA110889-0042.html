			<p><P> November 8, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCREEN STYLE / SIZZLE, NO FIZZLE  </P> <P> The Movie: "The Fabulous Baker Boys."  </P> <P> The Look: Smoldering. No, we don't mean the standard issue tuxedos worn by the  boys (Jeff and Beau Bridges). We're talking about Susie Diamond (Michelle  Pfeiffer), a nightclub singer, whose wardrobe of tight dresses and big, drippy  earrings are a primer in dressing with sex appeal.  </P> <P> The Labels: New York designer Ronaldus Shamask made the black cocktail dress  Diamond wears for her first lounge appearance with the boys. Costumer Lisa  Jensen took in the seams to make sure the fit was skin tight. But, she says,  that's the only label in Diamond's wardrobe that she can recall.  </P> <P> The Stores: Jensen does remember where she shopped, exactly. The discount  houses on Santee Street in downtown Los Angeles, thrift shops in The Valley,  Neiman Marcus in Beverly Hills and Addictions on Sunset. Almost everything was  priced under $100, since Jensen figured that would be about all Diamond could  afford on her tight budget.  </P> <P> The Plan: Presumably, the brash, confident Diamond doesn't read Vogue for  lessons in how to exude sensuality. She just follows the golden rule of sex  appeal: Don't show it all. Although she has an ideal body, she avoids wearing  anything obviously sexy, like the predictable, slit-to-the-thigh. As Jensen  puts it: "You don't always have to go for massive amounts of flesh pushed  together. You should play hide-and-seek with the body."  </P> <P> The Program: To show off her lithe figure, Diamond's clothes are contoured to  the body (several are made of Spandex), but still cover enough of her to seem  subtle, compared with more obvious approaches to sexy dressing. Long sleeves  make the point, as do bolero jackets that allow just a suggestion of midriff to  show. The only bits of torso on view are the shoulders, neck, cleavage or back.  Nothing gaudy about the color schemes either. Diamond goes for rich jewel tones  or basic black. Instead of slit, sliced and suggestive shoes, Diamond wears  classy black pumps (OK, so they have stiletto heels), and sheer black hose. No  rhinestones running up the leg and no patterns. Rings, bracelets, and dangling,  shoulder-length earrings provide the glitter.  </P> <P> The Payoff: Diamond's garnet-red velvet dress, worn in her slithery "Making  Whoopee" number on New Year's Eve, is the piece de resistance, a model in  sex-appeal, and the only garment in the show that Jensen designed. It's a  '30s-like halter-top number that hugs every curve. And while it suggests quite  a lot, it doesn't expose much. The snowflake- shaped "diamond" earrings that  complete the outfit all but beg to be twirled. BETTY GOODWIN  </P></p>

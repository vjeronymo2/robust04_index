Sao Paulo  businessman Marcio Goldfarb, who is a retailer and who deals in  ready-made clothes, gave this signal of alert. He said  manufacturers hiked compact disk prices by 90 percent in  January. To replace products as they are sold, supermarkets are  paying 50 percent more for them and contracts are being written  with safeguard clauses. Exporters seek to move up the dates for  closing exchange contracts and thus have less dollars in cash  when the day to convert them comes.    Pouring his heart out, Ivan Botelho, president of the  Cataguazes-Leopoldina Group, said: "There is an atmosphere of  unpatriotic speculation." The inflation rate calculated on  basis of the IGP-DI [General Prices Index-Domestic Availability]  totalled 42.19 percent in January. This is the highest since  March 1990. The IPCA [Expanded Consumer Price Index] rose to  41.31 percent and the INPC [National Consumer Price Index] to  41.32 percent. Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso has  asserted that he will not subordinate the economic calendar to  the political one.</p>

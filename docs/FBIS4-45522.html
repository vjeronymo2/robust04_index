			<p>Allegations   <F P=102>   PA2206045194 Santa Fe de Bogota Emisoras Caracol Network in  Spanish 0203 GMT 22 Jun 94 </F>  <F P=103> PA2206045194 </F> <F P=104>  Santa Fe de Bogota Emisoras Caracol Network </F> <F P=105>  Spanish </F> BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Colombian President-elect Ernesto Samper </F> Pizano at Narino Palace in Santa Fe de Bogota on 21  June--recorded]    [Text] Samper: The truth is that if the campaign  is investigated it will be because we have requested it. We  were officially notified of the cassette during the latter part  of last week when it was officially given to us at the [words  indistinct]. At the time, we were also told that it had been  given to the president of the republic. This cassette contains  very serious accusations against both campaigns; Dr. Andres  Pastrana's campaign as well as ours. I am adamant about having  this matter cleared up thoroughly so that we may know exactly  which representatives of Dr. Pastrana's campaign and my  campaign, were apparently involved in using drug trafficking  money during the past presidential elections.    I will accept the results of the investigations that must be  made by the Prosecutor General, and if anyone who worked for my  campaign, is proven to have been involved--as the cassette  indicates--in this incident, they will be withdrawn from my  government and they will not participate in my administration,  regardless of the legal penalties that may be imposed on them.    Thus, I believe, this case has to be totally clarified. I,  as President, assure Colombians that this procedure will allow  us to know the truth regarding the events described in the  cassette, which was revealed yesterday and which involves my and  Dr. Pastrana's campaign.    Reporter: It had been said initially [words  indistinct] because there was information that drug trafficking  money was being used in politics. Does this have anything to do  with this latest incident?    Samper: Maribel, the code of ethics was really  implemented rigorously throughout. Today, I obtained the  information I had requested on the campaign and it allows me to  reiterate, as I said yesterday, that money of doubtful origin  has not been used in my campaign. I want to invite any  Colombian or media source, who cares to do so, to conduct a  thorough examination of my campaign's accounting books. I made  this commitment and I maintained it to the end. Likewise, the  ethical prosecutor studied the origin of all the resources used  in my campaign. That is why I am absolutely at ease and I want  to express my total tranquility to Colombians. No drug  trafficking resources were used in my campaign and the  Prosecutor General will also be able to assess this in the books  we presented to him today for his scrutiny.    Reporter: Good evening, Dr. Samper. You said the  tape was officially delivered to you. Were you informed at that  time who the people in this recording were?    Samper: No. We simply received the tape. We were  told it contained accusations against both campaigns and that  the government wanted us to know about it. After viewing the  tape, we issued a first declaration rejecting the statements  made in the tape. Second, I met with the prosecutor general  today for over three hours and, as president-elect, officially  requested this investigation. It is in the best interests of the  former Samper and Pastrana campaigns and of democracy that this  issue be clarified. I repeat: I will abide by the results of  the prosecutor general's investigation.    If that investigation reveals that people from my campaign  are involved in the events described on the tape, I am willing  to remove them from the campaign team. They will not join the  government and will be subject to the appropriate penalties.    Reporter: Dr. Samper, considering that microphones  were found at your home and campaign headquarters, do you think  this could be a campaign against you? What do you think is the  origin of this [word indistinct]?    Samper: I don't know. Based on what has been said  by the people who conducted the preliminary investigation, I  think the tape is authentic. I hope it is not part of a plot  against me, because that would have the effect not of  discrediting Ernesto Samper but of undermining democracy. I  want to reiterate to all Colombians that we have paid a high  price in blood over the last 10 years to move our country ahead  and defeat narcoterrorism. I was personally a victim of  narcoterrorism. That gives me the moral authority to tell  Colombians that we will continue to work at home and abroad to  let the world know we are not the perpetrator but the main  victim of drug trafficking.    Reporter: Good evening, Dr. Samper. There is a  recording linking your campaign to drug money. How can you  justify this incident? What is your opinion? How will this  affect national and international public opinion, considering  that you were just elected president on Sunday?    Samper: As I have said, this tape implicates the  two campaign groups of the recent presidential campaign. I  think the mere act of sowing doubt adversely affects the  country. It affects the country's image abroad. I am therefore  committed to clarifying this matter, not only as Ernesto Samper,  former presidential candidate--I assume this commitment because  I must defend the integrity of my campaign, as I have reiterated  over the past year--but also as president of Colombia so this  issue will not affect Colombia's long struggle against drug  trafficking. This evening I reaffirm my commitment to continue  fighting drug trafficking in all its forms. I also wish to  reaffirm this commitment so Colombia's international image will  not be affected.    I emphatically reject the charges. It is disturbing to think  that these incidents could become a regular thing, as is thought  by people in some parts of the world where they believe all  Colombians are drug traffickers. I reject this assertion and  the insinuations in the tape, in which two people are holding a  dialogue apart from any campaign. This dialogue ultimately  affects the two main candidates in the recent election.</p>

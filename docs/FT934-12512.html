			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / International Company News: SA retailer up despite market weakness PEPKOR, South Africa's largest mass-market retail group, increased attributable profit in the six months to August by 8 per cent to R48.7m (Dollars 14.5m), from R45m last time. The markets in which Pepkor operates continue to be depressed with consumer confidence low, disposable income down and unemployment, especially in the market segments served by Pepkor, rising. Turnover, as a result, rose by only 2 per cent - well below inflation - to R3.8bn. Margins, however, were maintained and operating profit was also 2 per cent higher at R98.9m. Earnings per share rose by 5 per cent to 29 cents from 27.7 cents and the dividend was increased by 6 per cent to 8.5 cents per share. Mr Christo Wiese, chairman, said that barring political setbacks, he expected Pepkor to continue the earnings growth of the first six months for the remainder of the year. A divisional breakdown of earnings shows that Pep, the clothing retailer that is the core of the group, suffered a 5 per cent fall in earnings. Pep's chain of Scottish stores, known as Your More Store, is expected to break even in the second half of the year. Shoprite/Checkers, the food arm, continued rationalisation and expansion, with earnings rising by 7.7 per cent. Cashbuild increased earnings by 48 per cent and they rose by 19 per cent at Smart Centre. Mr Wiese said Pepkor was in a consolidation phase following some large takeovers in recent years.</p>

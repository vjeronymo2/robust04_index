			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Council offers to open books Labour-controlled Birmingham city council yesterday invited the District Auditor to examine its spending procedures in an attempt to clear the air after newspaper allegations that councillors tried to buy votes in May's local elections. Announcing the decision to invite inspection of decisions taken under the Pounds 7m Meeting Needs Across the City programme, Ms Theresa Stewart, council leader, said she was confident that the district auditor would find 'no basis for these allegations and nothing improper'. According to the allegations, published in the Sunday Times, money supposedly earmarked for improving environmental conditions in deprived areas was used instead to win over middle-class voters in vulnerable Labour wards. In the local elections Labour held its majority against the expectations of many. One of its two gains was in middle-class Edgbaston, which had never gone Labour before.</p>

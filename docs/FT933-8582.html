			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Early bonds rally fails to inspire Dow Wall Street US STOCKS stayed close to opening values yesterday in spite of more good inflation news and further gains in bond market prices, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.56 at 3,569.65, having moved in a tight trading range all day. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended up 1.18 at 450.14, while the Amex composite finished 1.50 firmer at 439.08, and the Nasdaq composite up 1.10 at 718.22. Trading volume on the NYSE was 215m shares. After Thursday's profit-taking and program selling, which lopped 14 points off the Dow, the mood of the markets was much more subdued, with sporadic buying by bargain hunters the only notable feature. For the second consecutive day, an early rally in bond prices failed to inspire equity investors. In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  1/4 at 98, and the yield had descended to a record low of 6.346 per cent. As on the previous day, yesterday's jump in bonds was sparked by good inflation news. The Labor department reported that its index of consumer prices rose by just 0.1 per cent in July, a slightly smaller increase than expected. Taken together with Thursday's reported decline in producer prices, analysts said that it was clear the inflationary threat to the economy, which reared its ugly head earlier this year, had fully abated. Among individual sectors, Mexican stocks were in demand following the news that trade negotiators from the US, Canada and Mexico had reached an agreement on labour and environmental issues that had been holding up approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Telefonos de Mexico rose Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 52 in volume of 3.8m shares, Mexico Equity &amp; Income Fund climbed Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 18 7/8 and Mexico Fund put on Dollars 1 1/2 at Dollars 26 5/8 . T2 Medical, down another Dollars 1 1/2 at Dollars 7, continued its plunge in the wake of news that the company will have to reduce its reported first and second quarter earnings because of accounting irregularities. Big computer stocks were in mixed form, with Compaq down Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 52 3/8 , but Hewlett-Packard up Dollars 1 7/8 at Dollars 75 3/8 . On the Nasdaq market, Borland International fell Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 16 1/4 after a US judge ruled that the company's revised version of its Quattro Pro product continues to violate Lotus Development's copyrights on its 1-2-3 spreadsheets. Lotus firmed Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 36 1/2 . Casino Data climbed Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 14 1/4 after the Nevada Gaming Control Board approved the company's multi-site system to link slot machines throughout the state. Canada TORONTO closed narrowly mixed in relatively quiet trading. The TSE-300 composite index closed up 5.65 points (0.14 per cent) at 4014.62, but declining issues outnumbered advances 348 to 330. Volume was 47.4m shares, compared with Thursday's 52.1m. On the week, the 300 composite index rose about 55 points. Eight of 14 sub-indexes closed higher, led by consumer products. Real estate was the biggest faller.</p>

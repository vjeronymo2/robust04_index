			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Phone services told to allow more competition THE US Federal Communications Commission has ruled that telephone companies must allow competitors greater access to public telephone networks. The decision paves the way for competition in the Dollars 90bn US regional telephone service market. 'A monopoly assures the quiet life. I think the quiet life has ended,' said Mr Alfred Sikes, FCC chairman. Its action yesterday represented 'a historic step' in opening 'one of the last monopoly reserves' in the telecommunications industry. 'This decision finally gives customers the ability to select the company that provides their local (telephone) access service,' said Mr Royce Holland, president of Metropolitan Fiber Systems, a company that has been seeking access to the local telephone service market. The FCC, in a series of unanimous decisions, is to allow companies that operate private networks to connect their networks to local telephone networks and has proposed letting such connections take public telephone services. The regulator also decided to change eventually the way local telephone companies price the use of their networks by long-distance telephone service providers. Prices will not change for the next 12 months, however, until a plan has been designed to link access charges to the volume of telephone traffic provided by a long-distance telephone company. 'With expanded competition, the FCC now should move quickly to reduce regulation of local exchange companies. That would represent further progress toward a fully competitive marketplace and be beneficial to consumers,' said Ameritech, the parent company of telephone companies in the Great Lakes region.</p>

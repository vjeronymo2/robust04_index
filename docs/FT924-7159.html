			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / World Trade News: Kuwait to go ahead with Dollars 2bn petrochemical plant KUWAIT will proceed with plans to build a Dollars 2bn petrochemical complex even if it cannot find a foreign partner, Mr Ali al-Baghli, the Gulf state's new oil minister, said, Reuter reports from Kuwait City. He said Kuwait would prefer to work with a foreign company which could provide technical expertise and help with marketing the products and training Kuwaiti staff. But he added: 'If it does not reach agreement with a foreign partner ..the company will proceed with implementing the project without foreign participation.' The project was approved in principle before the Iraqi invasion in August 1990, and state-owned Petrochemical Industries Company (PIC) has been looking for a partner to revive it since the liberation of Kuwait last year. The complex would produce ethylene and its derivatives.</p>

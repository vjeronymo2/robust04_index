			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Mariya Bogdanova report: "Sergey Shakhray Stays On as </F> Deputy Prime Minister. Shumeyko and Yegorov Get a Supervisor"]    [Text] Sergey Shakhray, leader of the Party for Russian  Unity and Accord, is expected to meet with Moscow State  University students today; tomorrow he will attend a seminar at  the "Lesnyye Dali" guest house outside Moscow designed to help  draw up a nationalities policy concept. Sergey Shakhray will  emerge before the audience as a victor: The president did not  accept his resignation from the post of deputy prime minister.    Boris Yeltsin, pointing a week ago through his press  secretary to Sergey Shakhray's "capriciousness," was nonetheless  forced to indulge the unsinkable politician's whims. On  Wednesday evening he told Sergey Shakhray during a private  meeting that he would not accept his resignation from the post  of deputy prime minister. Sergey Shakhray managed to show yet  again how much he matters for the Russian authorities and to  prove that his opponents' seemingly final victories are never  final.    By some accounts, it was representatives of the "Siberian  Accord" interregional association and some regional leaders --  evidently very far from the south from which the new minister,  Nikolay Yegorov, arrived in Moscow -- who threw their weight  behind Shakhray in the Kremlin. Mintimer Shaymiyev, together  with whom Shakhray made a proposal the other day on the Crimea  problem settlement, might be one of them. As a matter of fact,  during the meeting with the president, they discussed the  implementation of the treaty between Moscow and Kazan and the  preparation of a similar treaty with Kaliningrad.    According to the press service of Shakhray's party, he  promised to the president that he "will work" to ensure  coordination between the government, the Federal Assembly, and  the future Constitutional Court, to supervise the mass media,  and to continue to oversee regional and nationalities policy.  The latter obviously bodes no good to the Krasnodar team of  Shumeyko-Yegorov, which could have been almost fully in control  of relations between Moscow and the regions if Shakhray had  finally left the government. While under them a speedy start of  talks between Moscow and Groznyy has become a fairly realistic  possibility, now Shakhray looks certain to continue his  relations with the Chechen opposition along parallel lines.</p>

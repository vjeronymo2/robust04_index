			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / Saudis' US arms payments eased Saudi Arabia and the US have signed an agreement under which the cash-strapped Saudis will restructure Dollars 9.2bn (Pounds 6.1bn) in arms payments to five US companies, defence officials said yesterday, Reuter reports from Washington. The deal, signed on Saturday, could also clear the way for a reported plan by the Saudis to buy Dollars 6bn in commercial airliners from Boeing and McDonnell Douglas. The US defence officials said the restructuring deal was signed by officials of the two governments and of McDonnell Douglas, Raytheon, General Dynamics, FMC and General Motors. The Dollars 9.2bn in payments, previously scheduled over the next two years, cover part of some Dollars 30bn in US weapons orders by the Saudis. The defence officials said the plan would allow Saudi Arabia, which has been hit by declining oil prices, to stretch out payments for jet aircraft, missiles, tanks, armoured troop carriers and other arms, without cancelling planned purchases. The deal chiefly affects a Dollars 9bn deal by the Saudis to buy 72 McDonnell F-15 fighter aircraft. Instead of taking delivery of two of these jets each month, beginnining sometime next year, the Saudis would buy one each month, the officials said.</p>

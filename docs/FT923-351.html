			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / Letting of City offices agreed GT Management, international investment managers, has agreed to rent 24,000 sq ft in Alban Gate in the City, one of the largest new office blocks in London. The lease is for 25 years, with the option to cancel after 10 or 15 years. The deal follows last week's decision by Chemical Bank, the US investment bank, to take 164,000 sq ft of space in Alban Gate instead of Canary Wharf, the failed Docklands development. The letting reduces the vacant space in Alban Gate to 149,000 sq ft, or 40 per cent. The building's other tenant is Dibb Lupton Broomhead, solicitors.</p>

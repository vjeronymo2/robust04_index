			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on economic activities in Uruguay monitored through 23  June.    The automotive industry's export trade grew by 136 percent  in  the first quarter of the year as compared with the corresponding  period in 1993, with earnings totaling $34.3 million. This  expansion was due mainly to a surge in sales to Argentina of  cars assembled in Uruguay. There was also an upturn in the  export figures for the livestock sector, which grew 140 percent  in the first quarter, with earnings of $29.7 million. The export  of traditional products, representing 35 percent of the  country's total exports, recorded the greatest expansion,  earning $137.1 million. This was due mainly to the upswing in  the demand for and price of wool. Exports of dirty and  semiwashed wool grew by 125 percent in volume, reaching 8,670  metric tons in the first quarter. Exports of meat and meat  by-products rose by 14 percent, totaling $120 million. Other  exports, however, which had greatly expanded last year, have so  far this year recorded a decline. Exports of rice, for example,  plummeted by 25 percent, while the export of electricity, which  amounted to $11.3 million in the first quarter of 1993, is  practically zero due to the drop in Argentine demand.

The project seeks to curb tax evasion, improve  taxpayer services, and boost DGI personnel's productivity. The  IDB also announced the approval of a $1.05 million loan for the  National Customs Directorate, to be earmarked for decentralizing  and reorganizing the administration, training its staff,  expanding its computerized information service, and updating  regulations.

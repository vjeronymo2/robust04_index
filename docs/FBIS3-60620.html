			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Chin Chang-uk from Washington] </F>   [Text] It has been learned that the U.S. Government will  soon hold a meeting at the White House to study measures  concerning North Korea's response delivered on 3 December  regarding the inspection of North Korean nuclear facilities, and  has established a policy to refuse the North's proposal and  present a new proposal.    It is known to be a growing possibility that the U.S.  Government will make the "negative conclusion" because the  dominating opinion is that although the North's proposal  delivered through the nonofficial contact in New York shows  partial progress, the North's condition of accepting limited  inspection [chehanjok sachal] on its nuclear facilities is not  acceptable.    It is anticipated that the U.S. Government will eventually  notify North Korea of the refusal and repeat its demand for the  inspection of two undeclared facilities, which North Korea is  obstinately refusing.    According to a U.S. Government source on 6 December, it is  known that the message will be conveyed to North Korea during  the contact in New York on 6 or 7 December, after approval by  President Bill Clinton.    The source says the U.S. new proposal suggests that if North  Korea accepts inspection of two undeclared facilities, the date  for the third round of North Korean-U.S. talks may be confirmed.</p>

			<p><P> August 24, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> A SPECIAL DIMENSION TO 'BEING A GOOD SPORT'  </P> <P> At cocktail hour, you couldn't tell the press from the guests.  </P> <P> Up and down a hallway in the Newport Beach Marriott, cameras clicked and  flashed, questions flew, pen-and-paper wielders shouldered along distractedly.  </P> <P> At the center of the frenzy was L.A. Lakers star Byron Scott, whose annual  "Challenge for Children" fund-raising weekend culminated Saturday with a  black-tie dinner and auction. The event drew 500 guests at $100 each and  provided the autograph-and-photo hounds among them access to a smorgasbord of  celebrity.  </P> <P> Gracing the hotel hallway before dinner were basketball biggies Mark Eaton and  Darrell Griffith of the Utah Jazz, who along with a couple of dozen other pros  played in Scott's benefit game Friday night at UC Irvine's Bren Events Center.  </P> <P> Nearby, middleweight boxing champion Michael Nunn, who coached the winning team  on Friday, kidded his manager (and losing coach) Daniel Goossen.  </P> <P> "That's right, we won!" chanted Nunn, whose broad smile and handsome, unmarked  features look more like those of a model than a fighter. When Goossen scowled,  Nunn grew even more animated.  </P> <P> "You know how it is when they lose," he said. " 'My stomach hurts! My feet  hurt! It wasn't fair!' " Delivered with a laugh by a man whose line of work  leaves no room for excuses.  </P> <P> Mingling outside the silent auction room was forever-suave Richard Roundtree  (a.k.a. "Shaft"), who participated in a celebrity tennis tournament earlier in  the day, also a part of the fund-raising drive.  </P> <P> "I have three children, and I love kids," said Roundtree, who attended the  dinner with his wife, Karen. "Anything for kids I'm totally in support of.  Plus, I'm a big Lakers fan."  </P> <P> Actor Andrew Stevens made a Hollywood-style entrance with a blonde on one arm  and a brunette on the other. Stevens played in the celebrity golf tournament  held at the Costa Mesa Golf and Country Club.  </P> <P> Television's Alan Thicke brought date Kristy Swanson but declined to be  photographed with her because of what he called "dating paranoia."  </P> <P> "If you take that picture, then the rumors get started and the tabloids grab it  and go crazy. . . . " Et cetera, et cetera: The world of fame, according to  Thicke.  </P> <P> The weekend-long benefit raised $80,000, which will be divided among Childrens  Hospital of Orange County; South County Community Clinic in San Juan  Capistrano; Samaritan Medical Center in San Clemente, and the Byron Scott  Children's Fund Ltd.  </P></p>

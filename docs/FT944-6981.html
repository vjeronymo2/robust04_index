			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Lira falls to fresh low over concern on pension reform The lira fell to a record low against the D-Mark yesterday on fears the Italian government had given way to union demands on pension reform in order to head off a general strike planned for next Friday. There was also increased nervousness about the plight of Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister, who is due to be interrogated - probably this weekend - by Milan magistrates about alleged corruption while he ran his Fininvest business empire. Mr Berlusconi discussed the options open to himself and his embattled government in a frosty meeting with President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro yesterday. The prime minister's supporters claim the president is seeking to accelerate Mr Berlusconi's downfall and replace him with a government of national salvation. Despite progress during a meeting on Thursday between the government and the unions, the union leadership yesterday refused to call off the eight-hour stoppage. The unions were confident the increasingly weak rightwing coalition would make the concessions necessary to let them call off the strike. A negotiating session is scheduled for Wednesday. This would follow a cabinet meeting called to ensure all partners in the coalition are ready to back the final parliamentary passage of the 1995 budget. Mr Scalfaro is understood yesterday to have insisted on the need to pass the budget before any government crisis comes to a head, and to avoid instability through a clash with the unions. The concessions centre on removing pension reform proposals from the budget and finding alternative sources of revenue. However, financial markets were concerned that by treating the issue of pension reform separately the budget would be weakened and the eventual reform could be watered down. The lira slipped to L1,039 against the D-Mark in late Milan trade compared with Thursday's L1,035. The prime minister's position was further weakened yesterday because of his failure to obtain a public declaration of support for himself and his government from Mr Scalfaro. Mr Berlusconi had to deny instead that he was not 'at war' with the president. Also yesterday, newspapers published leaks from an impending decision of the constitutional court on the legality of the 1990 law on television ownership. The court was reported to have concluded that Mr Berlusconi's ownership of three commercial channels was unconstitutional. If so, the media magnate turned premier would have to divest at least one channel by 1996. Man in the News, Page 10 Currencies, Page 15 World stocks, Page 19</p>

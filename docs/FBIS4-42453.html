			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Takis Dhiamandis from Tirana] </F>   [Text] Albanian Foreign Minister Alfred Serreqi insisted to  a lawyer that Greek minority members were not arrested in  Albania but were merely summoned as witnesses.    The lawyer was Greek Ambassador to Albania Khristos  Tsalikis,  who was summoned to the Albanian Foreign Ministry the day before  yesterday for "briefing" purposes. The German, French, Italian,  British, U.S., Chinese, and Russian ambassadors were also  briefed.    The Greek ambassador, who is not accustomed to remaining  silent, told Serreqi: "Mr. Minister, I am a lawyer myself and  you will never convince me that anywhere in the world witnesses  are summoned with a strong police force and cages."    Commenting on Serreqi's statement that Athens cut off the  Greek-Albanian dialogue, Tsalikis reminded him that the Greek  side suggested a meeting between the two countries at the level  of experts, which the Albanian side rejected.    Replying to a remark by the Albanian minister that Greece  was  wrong to block European financial aid to Albania by taking  advantage of its European Union [EU] presidency, the Greek  ambassador said Greece had no reason to take advantage of the  presidency but only made a suggestion as an EU member. All EU  partners agreed with this suggestion... [ellipsis as published]    What did Serreqi, who as a pediatrician has no obligation to  know law or diplomacy, understand about this? The only one who  is in a position to know is Albanian President Sali Berisha, who  was briefed by the Albanian foreign minister yesterday morning.</p>

			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Survey of World Car Industry (13): Imports subdue old rivalries - America's Big Three offer each other a helping finger A RENAULT ESPACE mini-van, waiting to be taken apart in a Detroit workshop, is about to write a small but significant chapter in US motor industry history. The van will be the first to undergo a 'tear-down' - taking apart a vehicle for competitive analysis - by a joint engineering team involving all the Big Three Detroit manufacturers - General Motors, Ford and Chrysler. The trio has decided to save the money each would normally spend to buy and deconstruct foreign rivals' vehicles by pooling their efforts. It is a prime example of an unprecedented wave of cooperation among the Big Three, ranging from research spending to political lobbying, as they battle against Japanese manufacturers for competitive edge and market share. In the political arena, the three consult closely on issues such as trade - they filed a joint anti-dumping suit last year against Japanese mini-van manufacturers - and on motor industry regulations, such as exhaust emission controls. As Mr Lee Iacocca, the chairman of Chrysler, said in a recent interview : 'We're in consortia: we have continual discussions on health care costs, on regulation, on trade matters ..three groups we set up a year and a half ago. We said: 'Hey, guys, we may have differences but we can't tell the government we've got three different stories - that doesn't work in any negotiation.'' However, it is in the area of research and development that some of the most remarkable cooperation is now taking place. The Big Three have pooled their resources in research in nine different areas over the past four years. Until recently this would have been impossible, partly because of rivalry between the three but mainly because the US Government, pursuing a stern anti-trust policy, ruled out cooperation. Back in the late 1960s the Justice Department slapped a ban on an attempted collaboration by the trio to lower exhaust emissions. The officials feared the motor companies would try to stymie any breakthroughs in the field and delay the introduction of emission controls. However, Government attitudes changed in the 1980s as the US found its manufacturing industries losing ground in the battle against Japanese competition, which benefited from strong Government support and corporate cooperation. The result was the 1984 National Cooperative Research Act, which allowed US industry as a whole some exemption from anti-trust provisions for research work in so-called 'pre competitive' technology fields. Just what constitutes pre-competitive activity is something of a grey area, but it broadly means anything that comes before a manufacturer seeks to incorporate a R&amp;D breakthrough in one of his products. The automobile industry's first joint project came in 1988 when GM, Ford and Chrysler formed a consortium to study the use of polymer composites for structural vehicle parts. Others set up since then include three in the field of vehicle emissions: one, carried out in conjunction with the oil industry, looks at ways of improving air quality; another looks for new accurate instrumentation to measure low level emissions; and a third tries to accelerate the development of new emission control technology. Another important consortium, formed early last year, is trying to develop advanced batteries which might give much more power and range to electric vehicles. So many joint ventures are under way that last summer the three companies set up a special umbrella organisation, called the United States Council for Automotive Research (USCAR) to coordinate and monitor the efforts. The executive director of USCAR is Mr Don Walkowicz, formerly GM's manager of technical staffs and business planning, who is on secondment to the umbrella group for two years. He says the opportunities for new consortia 'are endless ..the task and the challenge we have is to figure out what is the greatest opportunity to get some synergistic effect out of pooling all the three groups together. 'We don't agree to work on something cooperatively unless it's a technology that all three companies agree has promise - and the three companies are still very competitive when it comes to the final product.' He also points out that a new R&amp;D challenge for the industry - both the consortia and individual auto companies - is to tap in to the huge pool of expertise available in US Government research labs. These used to be preoccupied with military applications but now, with the collapse of the Soviet empire, they are being encouraging to cooperate more with civilian businesses for the greater good of the US. Certainly, the auto industry consortia are unashamedly designed to boost the US manufacturers relative to their foreign rivals. A Japanese company which made overtures about joining the advanced battery project was turned down. Mr Walkowicz says USCAR's attitude toward foreign, particularly Japanese involvement is: 'We're looking at a globally, technologically competitive situation. The Japanese manufacturers have traditionally had this Government-industry partnership and what we're trying to do is catch up with them ..our goal is to make US auto manufacturers better than their global competitors.' One of the greatest problems in getting consortia running has been the culture of non-cooperation, deeply ingrained in engineers' minds by the anti-trust suit of the 1960s. This was particularly so this year when the three came to set up the consortium on emissions technology - the very area banned by the Justice Department more than 20 years before. 'We will be feeling our way into this venture, since we have all grown accustomed to tackling the emissions problem separately,' said Mr John McTague, Ford vice president for technical affairs. 'But the challenges that lie ahead are so great that we cannot afford to stay this course.'</p>

			<p><P> July 7, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> EXXON SEEKS TO REASSURE ALASKA OVER LOST DATA  </P> <P> Exxon missed a deadline Thursday to agree to a state of Alaska probe into the  destruction of computer records in the nation's worst oil spill, but company  officials said no relevant documents were lost.  </P> <P> Alaska Atty. Gen. Doug Baily demanded a full inquiry into the destruction of  documents and vowed to take Exxon to court if it refused to let state lawyers  question Exxon employees in Houston.  </P> <P> A company statement in Houston sought to reassure the state that no critical  documents were lost -- without mentioning the state's request to quiz some  Exxon employees under oath.  </P> <P> An Exxon computer technician, Kenneth Davis, complained that the company had  taken no steps to preserve spill documents that may prove instrumental in  court.  </P></p>

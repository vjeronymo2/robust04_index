			<p>BFN     [Text] Harare May 29 SAPA -- The capacity for Zimbabwe's  fragile political opposition to take on President Robert  Mugabe's ruling ZANU-PF [Zimbabwe African National  Union-Patriotic Front] party in elections next year appeared to  deteriorate sharply this weekend as the squabble-torn Forum  Party of Zimbabwe [FPZ] expelled its leader, former Chief  Justice Enoch Dumbutshena.    Reports in the local press on Sunday said the 75-year-old  lawyer had been voted out at a stormy meeting here on Saturday  where he was accused of incompetence, selfishness and a lack of  respect for other party officials.    He was replaced by the party's secretary-general, Mr Themba  Dhlodlo.    It was not clear if Mr Dumbutshena was present at the  meeting  of 300 delegates from five of the party's provincial  organisastions. Attempts to reach the ousted leader were  unsuccessful.    Observers say Saturday's action may well ring the death  knell  for the FPZ, torn by in-fighting almost since its inception two  years [ago]. FPZ was launched amid great hopes that its  leadership of respected figures could at last present a strong  challenge to Mr Mugabe.    Of the 120 elected seats in Zimbabwe's Parliament, only  three  are held by opposition MPs. Much of the rest of the opposition  is headed by failed elderly politicians.    Two months ago, a group of FPZ officials staged a  demonstration against Mr Dumbutshena, and he had 22 of them  expelled for indiscipline.    The incident occurred almost simultaneously as Mr Mugabe  tried to fire his party's youth league with enthusiasm on  Saturday. He urged them at their congress here to start a  house-to-house campaign to "send a message to those little  parties that think the opportunity is ripe to take over and  destroy the revolution".</p>

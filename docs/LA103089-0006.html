			<p><P> October 30, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CLIFF MAY  </P> <P> OK, California, drop those barbecue aprons to half-mast and pause a moment in  memory of Cliff May (Obituaries, Oct. 20).  </P> <P> Here was a man who made practical applications of the American spirit of the  times after WWII.  </P> <P> I lived in a Cliff May-inspired house in Long Beach and, except for a Wilson's  infielder's glove I used during the summers of 1958-1962, it was the most  elegantly form-fitting piece of construction I have ever occupied.  </P> <P> May's designs recognized and anticipated the middle-class social contour in  post-war California: the need for cheap housing for the returning GIs; lots of  space to expand for the growing families; removal of the public front porch to  the private back yard -- sans garage, of course; open, flowing space within the  houses to accommodate the interactions of family life.  </P> <P> Since May there have been others who have interpreted the changing zeitgeist,  notably the designers of all those apartment buildings with the underground  garage and just enough height to avoid the terrible expense of high-rise  building codes. In their own way, they are as important as May.  </P> <P> But how mean-spirited and glum are these buildings compared to the glowing  optimism of May's bourgeois charmers. What a lucky man he was to have designed  the architectural equivalent of hope.  </P> <P> JOHN LEVERENCE  </P> <P> Burbank  </P></p>

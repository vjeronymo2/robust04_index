			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / International Company News: KPN beats expectations with 17% gain Koninklijke PTT Nederland, the Dutch telecommunications and postal group which was partly privatised in June, posted a rise of nearly 17 per cent in first-half net profit, exceeding analysts' expectations. The company predicted a large increase in full-year profit, based on the results for the first six months. First-half net profit increased to Fl 1.02bn (Dollars 583m) from Fl 873m a year earlier, on turnover up 7.1 per cent at Fl 9.09bn. Analysts' forecasts had called for net earnings of between Fl 925m and Fl 995m. KPN said volume sales achieved by PTT Post, its postal arm, had exceeded expectations, reflecting increases in both domestic and international mail. Operating profit rose by slightly more than 25 per cent to Fl 263m. The postal subsidiary, which is active in third-party mail handling in other parts of the world, is seen as a possible model for other countries contemplating the privatisation of their postal authorities. PTT Telecom, the group's telecommunications subsidiary and its largest single business, posted a 9.4 per cent increase in turnover and a 4.8 per cent rise in operating profit to Fl 1.51bn. KPN's interim dividend has been fixed at Fl 0.80, in line with a forecast published in the share prospectus in June. The government's sale of a 30 per cent stake in KPN raised nearly Fl 7bn, making it the biggest bourse flotation in Dutch history. It is due to be followed by a second tranche of shares by the end of 1997. The first-half figures were released after the close of bourse trading in Amsterdam, where KPN's shares closed at a new high of Fl 51.80. They had been floated at Fl 49.75, with private investors receiving a discount of Fl 2.50 on the first 75 shares.</p>

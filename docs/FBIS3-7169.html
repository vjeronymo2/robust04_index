Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Minister Kim Yang-pae  told the press Thursday the government had revised its farm  market opening schedule submitted to the General Agreement on  Tariffs and Trade (GATT) on March 11 through bilateral  negotiations with the United States, the European Union and  Australia, which pressed for revisions.    The revised schedule is to be sent to the GATT Secretariat  on  Friday, he said.    Under the revised schedule, rice imports will be 51,307 tons  a year, the level first set by the government. The U.S.  Government retracted its demand for 56,000 tons.    The new schedule calls for exclusion of 26 items, including  pork, chicken and raw silk, from the 118 items subject to import  fees under the March 11 schedule.    Tariff rates on 385 items, 29.3 percent of the 1,312 items  for import liberalization under the schedule, will be lowered  and an ad valorem duty, charged as a percentage of the value of  an item, will be applied on 1,249 items. The number of items  upon which an ad valorem duty or a specific duty can be  selectively applied decreased from 97 under the March 11  schedule to 63 under the revised one.    In addition, tariff rates on 354 items will be lowered to  the  levels set under the first schedule submitted in April 1992 at  the request of the United States and other countries.    Potato powder imports will be increased from 10 tons to 60  tons a year, while the duty on ice cream powder will be lowered  from 60 percent to 40 percent.</p>

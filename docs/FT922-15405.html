			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Election 1992: Polls reflect concern over health policies A DELAYED reaction to Labour's health broadcast and adverse voter reaction to Conservative 'negative campaigning' were the reasons Mr Neil Kinnock's team gave for the sharp upturn in his campaign's poll fortunes yesterday. At least part of that thesis appeared to be borne out in the detailed figures behind the Mori poll for The Times. It showed 56 per cent naming the National Health Service as their chief concern - a 10-point rise from the beginning of the election campaign. A total of 53 per cent of voters believed that the NHS was unsafe in Mr John Major's hands, against 38 per cent who held that it was safe. Worse still for the Conservatives, 57 per cent do not believe the government's assurances that it would not privatise the NHS, against 32 per cent accepting its word. The findings were also damaging for Conservative strategists. Some 65 per cent of Liberal Democrats and 56 per cent of Labour supporters believed their parties had the best campaigns. Only 24 per cent of Tories would make the same claim. Tax was named by only 15 per cent of all polled as likely to affect their vote. The Harris poll for ITN showed a fall in Tory support among women and semi-skilled workers, designated C2s. Support had fallen five points among both groups to 36 points and 28 points respectively. In the ICM poll for The Guardian 81 per cent of Labour supporters said they were certain to vote, against 83 per cent for the Liberal Democrats but 76 per cent for the Tories. A poll by Bath University put Mr Chris Patten, the Conservative party chairman, on 39.5 per cent, one point behind the Liberal Democrat challenger Mr Don Foster. The poll sample was 871 and the university quoted a 3.5 per cent margin of error. A local poll in Birmingham Northfield suggested that Labour is set to capture the marginal seat from the Tories.</p>

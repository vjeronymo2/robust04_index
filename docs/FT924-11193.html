			<p>921027 FT  27 OCT 92 / Wellcome Trust drops big fund managers WELLCOME TRUST, the medical charity, yesterday surprised the fund management industry by its choice of eight investment managers to handle its Pounds 2.75bn portfolio. The total includes more than Pounds 2bn raised this summer through the sale of some of the trust's shares in Wellcome, the pharmaceutical company, but not its remaining 40 per cent stake which has a market value of Pounds 3.5bn. The trust's mandate was the largest ever awarded in the UK investment industry and the successful firms are expected to gain considerable prestige from their appointment. Wellcome is also said to have succeeded in countering the trend towards higher fees in the industry, paying roughly 0.15 per cent of funds under management, well below average. The list of eight, chosen from 237, was surprising as much for the names omitted as those included. Two of the charity's existing investment managers, Morgan Grenfell and James Capel, were not reappointed. Mercury Asset Management, the largest UK fund manager, although a finalist, was not selected. MAM declined to comment, although it was said to have been disappointed. Morgan Grenfell said yesterday it was disappointed to have lost Wellcome Trust as a client but did not regard this as a severe setback. By contrast, the successful candidates included two relatively small firms with a 'boutique' image and a reputation for shrewd stock-picking: Edinburgh-based Baillie Gifford &amp; Co and London-based Newton Investment Management. Hambros Bank, also chosen, is expected to specialise in managing the trust's portfolio of gilt-edged stock. The other appointments included two of the firms already handling parts of the portfolio, Fleming Investment Management and Henderson Pension Fund Management. Also chosen was Schroder Investment Management, which has been interim manager of the funds since the sale proceeds were received in August. The two other fund managers are Gartmore Pension Fund Managers and Phillips &amp; Drew Fund Management. Background, Page 26</p>

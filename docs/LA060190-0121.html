			<p><P> June 1, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> DISNEY'S T-SHIRT CAMPAIGN A PREMATURE FLOP?;  </P> <P> MARKETING: 'DICK TRACY' PROMOTION RUNS INTO SOME SNAGS.  </P> <P> When patrons showed up in movie theaters last weekend and asked where they  could buy the "Dick Tracy" T-shirts that would serve as their admission tickets  to a special pre-opening midnight screening of the movie June 14, some theater  operators didn't have a shirt to their name.  </P> <P> "Disney started running ads announcing the T-shirt promotion on Friday, but  some theaters didn't even get their shirts until Tuesday," said an executive of  a national theater chain. "They jumped the gun on this one, there's no  question."  </P> <P> Disney executives would not comment on details of the T-shirt promotion, but  sources in the exhibition industry say that because "Dick Tracy" was shown to  film buyers later than usual, the studio could not close its bidding until May  23, two days before the T-shirt promotion began. Newspaper and magazine ads  announced that the "limited edition" T-shirts "go on sale May 25 at  participating theaters" but many of the estimated half-million shirts were  still en route on Monday.  </P> <P> A Disney official said that about 1,500 theaters are participating in the  T-shirt/midnight screening promotion, but he said the studio wasn't really  expecting the campaign to kick in until this weekend. One exhibitor whose  T-shirts did arrive on time said one of his chain's multiplexes sold only 9  shirts over Memorial Day Weekend. "Disney has stepped in a black hole on this  one," he said.  </P> <P> Other exhibitors reported different results: Milt Moritz, vice president for  advertising and public relations at Pacific Theaters, which owns 300 screens in  California and will be showing "Dick Tracy" on 13 of those, reported that sales  of T-shirts had been brisk since they began last Friday. "In some theaters  we've sold as much as 30% already," Moritz said. "I'd be surprised if we don't  sell it (the midnight screening) out."  </P> <P> Word of the T-shirt snafu may have had executives smiling at other studios, and  combined with Disney's earlier decision to move the opening of "Dick Tracy"  back a week from June 8 to June 15, it fueled hopes that the Warren  Beatty-directed comic strip film won't be the 800-pound box office gorilla that  many people expect it to be. But the exhibitors who won the bidding war for the  film have seen the movie and are betting big money that it's going to be a hit.  </P> <P> "Exhibitors are going for it hook, line and sinker," said John Krier, president  of Exhibitor Relations, a company that provides trade information to theater  owners. "We've all seen the picture and liked it, but we don't know yet if the  public will go for it."  </P> <P> "Dick Tracy," which co-stars Beatty, Madonna and Al Pacino, was not shown to  exhibitors until the middle of May and exhibition sources say even Disney  executives were surprised at the bids made on the movie. One chain reportedly  committed to showing "Dick Tracy" for 20 weeks -- which would extend it into  November.  </P> <P> Still, some industry observers are skeptical, pointing to Disney's midnight  opening of "Dick Tracy" as a desperate act to give the movie the kind of cachet  that sent "Batman" on to box office glory last summer. The Batman logo and  T-shirt went on to become the Kitsch of the Year in 1989; the biggest question  hanging over "Dick Tracy" is whether a generation of kids will take to the  comic book detective the way they took the more enduring figure of Batman.  </P> <P> The Disney official, who asked not to be identified, said the studio is happy  with the T-shirt promotion and denied that a new ad campaign -- beginning  Friday, theater chain listings will be topped by a one-inch ad promoting the  T-shirt sales -- is a result of weak Memorial Day sales.  </P> <P> According to the bid letter that went out to exhibitors, the studio asked that  every theater whose normal admission price is $5 or more to charge at least $12  for the midnight screening shirt. The theaters will reimburse Disney $6 for  each shirt sold, plus 50% of the difference between $6 and the sales price of  the shirt -- which would still mean that the theaters would keep a larger  percentage of the box office gross for this particular screening than is  customary.  </P> <P> The Disney spokesman said the promotion was conceived a month ago as "a unique  way of launching the picture. It's a response to our feeling about the movie .  . . (but) it's just one small element of the whole marketing plan."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial from the "Notes and Information" page: "The New </F> Target of Traffickers"; passages within slantlines published in  italics]    [Text] There is a new color in the uniforms of Rio de  Janeiro drug traffickers: olive green. Although the information  has not yet been confirmed, the precise details that have been  supplied do not permit many doubts to be entertained. In Santa  Cruz, the Conjunto Antares drug traffickers' boss has for months  dressed his men in Army uniforms! Two members of the gang led  by the trafficker--who "works" under the curious alias of  /Soldier/--were arrested by the Drug Control Precinct (DRE), and  revealed that the uniforms are obtained from recruits serving in  Western Zone barracks. /Soldado/ does not buy them; he barters  them for drugs. The recruits are not only addicts. According  to /a former drug spot manager/--an important post within drug  trafficking hierarchy--they receive "a larger amount of drugs"  for each stolen uniform in order to open a market in a  privileged sector: the barracks!    This information is serious, but not because it deals with a  bold attack against the Army. After all, how long have  newspapers been reporting successive arms robberies from Army  barracks? This has happened not only in Rio de Janeiro and--to  tell the truth--not only in the Army, because the Navy and the  Air Force have also been victims of that crime. It would be  enough to know the caliber of the arms that the police have  seized from drug traffickers' arsenals to identify the link  between the broad availability of heavy weapons, which are for  exclusive military use, and drug trafficking. The problem  consists in the new step forward: the possession of uniforms.    The fact that drug traffickers steal uniforms that are used  by Brazilians who are serving in the national Army has obvious  significance: It is, as such, so serious that no additional  observation is necessary. Aside from the worrisome implications  of traffickers dressing in uniform, what is the objective of  bartering military uniforms for drugs? To have available an  "assortment" that can open any door? Or, on the next fight with  the PM [Military Police] or the Civil Police, make traffickers  appear as Army members, creating an institutional crisis?    Those who hurriedly proclaim that "the Army on the streets"  is the only solution for the state of calamity in Rio de  Janeiro, should reflect a bit on the reason why traffickers want  to have military uniforms. The Conjunto Antares /soldiers/ have  confirmed the possibility for drug trafficking to enter the  barracks. This is why it is necessary to pay attention to one  fact: The longer the Army remains in direct contact--through  repression--with the world of drugs, the longer Army  soldiers--the true soldiers--will be exposed to a dangerous  coexistence. Those who always imagine that the worst will  happen should carefully reflect on the robbery of uniforms. The  vulnerability of the forces of law might be at stake. That is  why it is important to find out, as soon as possible, the reason  why drug trafficking has chosen this target.    Those who imagine that the price of cocaine is the main  antidote against /contamination/ of the troops should recall the  results of a poll made in September by the Rio de Janeiro State  Drug Control Council. According to this poll, 28 percent of the  addicts who tried to obtain some help to end their addiction  earn a minimum salary, while 56 percent of cocaine consumers  live in the northern Rio de Janeiro zone! The poll's conclusion  deserves attention: Drugs have reached sectors that do not have  enough money to buy meat.    Drug traffickers have an organization that observes methods  and adopts efficiency techniques. In July, in the Tijuca  forest, DRE agents clashed with drug traffickers in a battle in  which the latter used authentic guerrilla warfare methods. In  the Roquete Pinto ghetto, the troops that protected the area  after shots were fired on a recruit of the Ramos 1st Infantry  Battalion found a surprising copy of their methods. For the  time being, stolen uniforms are only a "passport" to a  concentrated, well located market. They hint, however, at  another type of use that is hard to identify by common sense.  Yet common sense advises that if the worst is to be avoided,  the Army should keep away from drug trafficking.</p>

The deputies decided to return  to the consideration of their status later, since the State Duma  had not yet passed the law "On the status of the deputy of the  Federal Assembly."    The session approved the structure of the chamber's staff  and  set their salaries equal to those of government support staff.  Each deputy will have an unlimited number of assistants and  manage a fund equal to 80 minimum salaries plus guaranteed  bonuses and compensations to pay their salaries out of.    The Federation Council scheduled its next session for  February 18.    The draft agenda of the next meeting includes discussing the  findings of the council's commission in the area of the  Ossetian-Ingush conflict, approving the composition of  parliamentary committees, looking into the results of the  activities by the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly and passing a  plan of legislative activities. The Federation Council also  plans to invite Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin on the same  day.    As was announced before, Russian President Boris Yeltsin is  expected to make his annual address to the Federal Assembly on  social and economic policies on February 18.</p>

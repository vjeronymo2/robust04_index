			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Mojave informed the Commission that it plans to amend its application after the issuance of this notice. Specific details regarding any changes to the proposed project will be available at the public scoping meetings. The landowners who would be affected by that amendment will receive a copy of this notice. At a minimum Mojave expects the amendment to include:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) An alternative pipeline alignment between Bakersfield and Lindsay;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) An extension of its Palo Alto Segment of approximately 30 miles to a location near Hunters Point;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) An alternative siting of its Famoso Compressor Station near Lindsay; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) An alternative pipeline alignment to avoid the Contra Costa Water District's Los Vaqueros Reservoir Project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several of the customers receiving gas from Mojave as part of this project will need to build pipelines to take the gas delivered to them. Although these facilities are not under the jurisdiction of the FERC, they will be discussed in the EIR/EIS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Land Requirements for Construction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Mojave proposes to build its new mainline and pipeline segments in construction rights-of-way ranging from 30 to 75 feet wide. After construction, 0 to 30 feet would be maintained as permanent easement. Specific widths of the rights-of-way vary, depending on the proposed pipeline diameter for specific locations. The proposed loops would be built parallel and adjacent to Mojave's existing pipelines, using as much of the existing rights-of-way as possible for the construction right-of-way. The three new compressor stations would require approximately 20 acres each.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additional temporary work space may be required at major river, road or railroad crossings, or where similar obstacles are encountered. Mojave would purchase the temporary and permanent easements necessary for constructing the project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Construction of the pipelines would normally follow standard pipeline construction methods: right-of-way clearing and grading; trenching; pipe stringing, bending, welding, joint coating, and lowering in; backfilling of the trench; and cleanup and restoration. Mojave proposes to implement erosion control and revegetation measures and to use special construction techniques for wetland and water crossings and for construction in residential areas. These construction procedures and mitigation plans will be discussed further in the Draft EIR/EIS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pipeline loops in or adjacent to existing rights-of-way would generally require less clearing and grading. Rotary-wheeled ditching machines, backhoes, or rippers would be used to excavate a sufficiently deep trench. For buried pipelines, the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) requires a minimum of 30 inches of cover in normal soils and 18 inches in consolidated rock. In populated areas, this increases to 36 and 24 inches of cover, respectively. Blasting would be required when areas of consolidated rock are encountered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pipeline segments would be designed according to DOT minimum safety standards and specifications (49 CFR part 192) and would be hydrostatically tested before being placed in service. Mojave would be required to obtain appropriate Federal and state discharge permits prior to hydrostatic testing. No chemicals would be used during this testing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> The EIR/EIS Process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NEPA requires the Commission to take into account the environmental impacts that could result from a major Federal action whenever it considers the issuance of a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity. The California SLC, as a cooperating state agency, is required to consider the same potential impacts within the State of California under the CEQA. The EIR/EIS we are preparing will give both the SLC and the Commission the information we need to do that.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NEPA (and CEQA) also requires us to discover and address concerns the public may have about proposals. We call this ``scoping''. The main goal of the scoping process is to focus the analysis in the EIR/EIS on the important environmental issues, and to separate those issues that are insignificant and do not require detailed study.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EIR/EIS will discuss impacts that  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> could <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  occur as a result of the construction and operation of the proposed project.

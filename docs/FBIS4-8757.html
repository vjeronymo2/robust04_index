			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, April 17 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Serb leader  Radovan Karadzic said on Sunday an immediate ceasefire for the  Gorazde area had been agreed upon during his talks with U.N.  special envoy Yasushi Akashi.    "We have agreed on the separation of forces as much as  possible, maximum restraint from actions and provocations and,  finally, the maximum effort in the humanitarian sphere," said  Karadzic after talks with Akashi in Pale, the political and  military centre of the Bosnian Serb republic.    He said U.N. helicopters would evacuate the wounded from  Gorazde on Monday morning and added: "If we succeed in  implementing the ceasefire and the separation of forces, we can  say we are approaching peace in Gorazde."    Fighting in the Gorazde area escalated in late March, when  about 10,000 Moslems from Gorazde -- a U.N.-designated "safe  haven" which should have been demilitarized last spring --  mounted a powerful offensive on the surrounding Serb  territories. The Serbs responded by launching a  counteroffensive.    When the Moslems were all but defeated, the U.N. stepped in  and ordered NATO air strikes against Bosnian Serb positions  around Gorazde, after which the Serbs suspended all relations  with the U.N. Protection Force.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Donald Macintyre: "MP's Career Threatened by </F> Iraqi TV Appearance"]    [Text] George Galloway, the controversial MP for Glasgow  Hillhead, was facing the most serious threat yet to his  chequered Parliamentary career after taking part in friendly  exchanges with Saddam Husayn on Iraqi television.    A furious John Smith, the Labour leader, ordered an  immediate  investigation into the conduct of Mr Galloway which could lead  to the withdrawal of the Labour whip and the consequent risk of  his eventual deselection.    Despite Mr Galloway's insistence that he had saluted the  Iraqi people rather than Saddam Husayn, his troubles deepened  last night when the BBC played a tape from its Caversham  monitoring unit, appearing to confirm that he had spoken in the  broadcast of the dictator's "courage, strength and  indefatigability."    Mr Galloway said on his return yesterday: "I did not say  anything in praise of Saddam. I was referring to the Iraqi  people, their strength, their courage, their forbearance." Mr  Galloway, and two Greek MPs who were also on the trip, are part  of a group set up in Athens last year to lobby for an easing or  lifting of the UN embargo imposed in response to Iraq's 1990  invasion of Kuwait. Mr Galloway told BBC Radio Scotland that he  had described Saddam Husayn just weeks ago as a "bestial  dictator."    But the Caversham tape, played on BBC Radio's World Tonight,  records Mr Galloway, apparently directly addressing Saddam, as  saying: "Sir, I salute your courage your strength and your  indefatigability and I want you to know that we are with  you...." Mr Galloway then breaks into an Arabic phrase in which  the word Nasir (victory) is audible. The Reuter news agency had  earlier quoted Mr Galloway as saying that..."we are with you  until victory."    Labour stood by a strongly worded statement from John Smith,  party leader, warning that "the Opposition Chief Whip will see  Mr Galloway immediately on his return to the Commons with a view  to initiating disciplinary action." Speaking before Mr  Galloway's denials, Mr Smith said: "I deeply deplore the foolish  statement made in Iraq by Mr George Galloway. In no way did he  speak for the Labour Pary and I wholly reject his comments."    While the whips will not recommend a specific penalty until  they have established the facts, the controversial MP was still  facing at least a stiff formal reprimand.    The anger of the Labour whips was intensified by the fact  that Mr Galloway's unauthorised trip meant he missed at least  two key votes.</p>

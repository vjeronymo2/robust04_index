			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / European bank aims to start lending by June THE European Bank for Reconstruction and Development hopes to begin lending to the former communist countries of eastern and central Europe before June this year, according to Mr Jacques Attali, the bank's president-designate. In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Attali said the first operations would probably take the form of co-financing with other international institutions such as the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the International Finance Corporation. Speaking before today's inauguration of the London-based bank, Mr Attali emphasised that the organisation would be cautious in building its loan portfolio. It is likely that the bank will also focus on providing western technical assistance for creating market-based economies. Mr Attali will this week seek additional 'special funds' from some of the 39 nations and two European Community bodies setting up the bank to finance technical assistance and training in addition to the bank's normal lending and investment activities. Mr Attali wants the bank to become a centre of expertise and influence as well as a promoter of democracy in the former communist countries. The bank will have a capital of Ecu 10bn (Pounds 6.9bn), of which 30 per cent will be paid in and available for equity investment in eastern and central Europe. The bank's treasury department has estimated that it could commit itself to lending Ecu 5.5bn and make equity investments of Ecu 600m in its first five years of operation. This would rise to Ecu 12.6bn and Ecu 1.8bn respectively over its first eight years. The expectation is that lenders would be encouraged by these commitments and other investors are expected to join projects supported by the bank. The bank's treasury estimates that its efforts could mobilise between Dollars 42bn (Pounds 23bn) and Dollars 50bn of loans and equity for eastern and central Europe in five years and between Dollars 100bn and Dollars 120bn in eight years.

			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / International Company News: Philips reduces stake in LCD unit Philips, the Dutch electronics group, has broadened Europe's assault on Japan's domination of the the world market for advanced liquid-crystal displays (LCDs) by selling a 10 per cent stake in its Flat Panel Display subsidiary to E. Merck of Germany. The transaction means Philips' stake in the company will fall to 70 per cent. It declined to give financial details. The Dutch group's two existing European partners, the French companies Thomson and Sagem, will each retain their 10 per cent holdings in the Eindhoven-based Flat Panel Display. E. Merck, a chemicals and pharmaceuticals group, makes materials used in the manufacture of LCDs, and wants to keep abreast of developments in the field, according to Philips. The Eindhoven factory already sells active LCDs, but full commercial production is not due to start until autumn. As the only European contender in the LCD market, it is gearing towards challenging the lead built up by Japanese companies such as Sharp, Toshiba and Hitachi. Flat Panel Display, established in 1993, employs 650 people. Philips has said that the company's potential turnover over the next few years could run into hundreds of millions of guilders. Unlike passive LCDs, which are widely-used in digital watches, active LCDs can accommodate colour moving pictures, making them an important part of displays in 'notebook' personal computers, as well as in consumer electronics. They can also be used as flat-screen televisions.</p>

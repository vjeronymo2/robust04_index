			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / Emerging Markets: Warning bells for Thai convertibles - The Emerging Investor For the past nine months, European investors wanting to profit from south-east Asia's equities boom while protecting themselves from the worst of the dangers of a market crash have been enthusiastic buyers of convertible Eurobonds issued by large Thai companies and quoted in London. The primary market in such bonds - which are usually denominated in US dollars and convertible into shares at a fixed value above the current share price - is likely to reach a peak in the next few months before tailing off towards the end of the year. Liberated by new financial services laws, Thai companies raised the equivalent of Dollars 1.4bn (Pounds 930m) through these so-called euroconvertible debentures in 1993, but the country's regulatory authorities have begun to sound warning bells about the risks of issuing too many bonds in too short a time. Next in line is Bangkok Bank, Thailand's largest bank and a prime blue chip company, which plans to raise between Dollars 400m and Dollars 500m through a convertible bond issue to expand its capital base. Bangkok Land, the country's biggest property company, has already gone to the convertible bond market for Dollars 130m, but wants to raise a further Dollars 600m. Thai Airways International is also considering an issue of about Dollars 200m. The convertible bonds of blue chip Thai companies are popular with investors  -especially the cautious Swiss who hesitate to invest directly in volatile equity markets, stockbrokers say - because the right to convert into shares gives the holder the chance to profit from a rising stock price with only limited exposure (in the form of a falling bond price) to the risks of a decline. Even if one discounts the equity conversion 'sweetener,' usually the main attraction of such issues, the interest rates paid by the Thai bonds (usually between 3 and 5 per cent) provide a satisfactory return compared with US dollar rates elsewhere. There is also an active secondary market. Thai companies favour the bonds over domestic bank borrowing because they can obtain funds at a fixed rate of interest and at less than half the present cost of a bank loan in Thai baht. The main disadvantage, from their point of view, of the bond is the future dilution of their stock when conversion rights are exercised - although because the conversion is at a premium to the current share price the dilution is smaller than if stock was issued at current prices. In recent weeks, however, brokers and government officials in Thailand have expressed concern about the dangers of the put options which many Thai issuers - nine out of 17 in 1993 - have added to the bonds to reassure potential investors. The put option allows the holder to redeem a bond early - typically after five years for a 10-year bond - at a fixed price at a premium to the issue price. Holders would normally exercise this right if the share price failed to rise enough to merit a conversion into shares. A put option makes a bond more saleable, but the company faces the possibility of having to repay the entire bond issue on the put option exercise date, a situation which caused severe financial difficulties for some British companies after the 1987 stock market crash. Some brokers say it is hard to imagine Thai stock prices failing to rise enough in five years to reach the conversion price. Conversion premiums over the price at the time of issue are rarely more than 20 per cent, and many holders of bonds issued last year by Land and House, the property developer, have already converted following the surge in the Thai stock market. Other brokers are more cautious. 'Thai companies have this optimistic view that their share prices will always go up and up,' says one foreign stockbroker in Bangkok. It has been suggested that auditors should force companies to set aside reserves each year as if the put payments will have to be met on the due date, but the idea is unlikely to be adopted in Thailand and undermines the purpose of borrowing the money in the first place. Thailand's Securities and Exchange Commission is worried not only about the risks to companies of the put options but also about the country's finances. 'Many of them (the bonds) are bunching up, particularly the ones with put options,' says Mr Rapee Sucharitakul of the SEC. 'It could affect the inflow and outflow of capital from the country if we're not careful.' The SEC has drafted a new regulation which should come into force within weeks to oblige companies to improve their disclosure on the effects of convertible bond issues. The companies will have to explain to shareholders both the potential earnings dilution effects of the issue and the possible results of early repayment of the debt. They will also have to inform the Bank of Thailand about new issues. After a few more big issues, the ardour among both issuers and buyers for new convertible Thai eurobonds is likely to cool. Most Thai companies with sufficient standing to raise money in this way have either issued bonds or announced their intention to do so, and a rise in US interest rates would make such instruments less attractive for the borrower. Furthermore, the market in London might, in the words of one broker, 'be getting slightly saturated'. Some Thai convertibles are already trading at a small discount to their issue price. 'We're going to see fewer and few issues from the second half of this year,' says one investment banker in Bangkok. 'But there will be a continuing trickle and an active secondary market. Then in a few years we're going to have the refinancing issues.'  -------------------------------------------------------------------- TEN BEST PERFORMING STOCKS  --------------------------------------------------------------------                                           Friday  Week on week change                                           dollar  ------------------- Stock                          Country     close     dollar       %  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Eczacibasi Ilac                 Turkey    0.8298     0.2407     40.87 Ege Biracilik                   Turkey    2.5879     0.6339     32.44 Doktas                          Turkey    1.2377     0.2607     26.68 Ssangyong Oil                 S.

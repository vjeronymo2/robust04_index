			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: A lesson in the need for capital Sir, There is a certain irony in your article 'Equip us for competitiveness' (Management: The Growing Business, February 8), concerning the visits which our association organised for Treasury officials to see for themselves the need for high-tech investment by small and medium-sized enterprises. On the very day of the visits, a leading British machine tool manufacturer, FMT Holdings, with technology and expertise in advance of US and European competitors and equal to any technology employed by the Japanese, was being forced into receivership by a lack of working capital which prevented it from taking advantage of any upturn in business. The company manufactured the kind of state-of-the-art technology in which UK companies should be investing to remain competitive - but are not doing so, especially in the SME bracket. There is a serious lesson in this for the banks and the government in that, having weathered such a long and deep recession, we are finding many examples of companies which are falling short of working capital, or which are unable to raise the finance for the crucial investment they need to make to improve their prospects for new business and markets. The message which came over very clearly from the companies visited by the Treasury is that UK industry has an opportunity for growth which it has not had for more than a generation. Such an opportunity can only occur if the investment in competitive technology follows. It is an opportunity that must not be missed through lack of finance.

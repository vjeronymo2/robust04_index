			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping by </F> unidentified correspondent; place and date not given: "SPD Chief  Scharping: The CDU Urgently Needs Rest..."]    [Text] [BILD] Mr. Scharping, please tell us whom you would  take into your government as ministers....    [Scharping] Later! In addition to good women and men in  political offices and functions, we also have excellent people  in industry, for example: Karl Otto Poehl, Edzard Reuter,  Manfred Lahnstein, and many others. They are experts! I also  like to use their technical knowledge.    [BILD] What would you do differently if you were in  government?    [Scharping] I would keep the ministers' salaries frozen for  some time to come, reduce the number of ministries, and appoint  fewer state secretaries. In the Construction Ministry alone,  there are three state secretaries -- this is a pure waste of  money.    [BILD] With which partner do you want to implement this?    [Scharping] This is a question about a coalition through the  back door. If the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] is  the strongest party, then the coalition partners will all come  by themselves. The will to participate in government is in the  nature of the liberals, but also of the greens.    [BILD] ...and of the Christian Democratic Union/Christian  Social Union [CDU/CSU]?    [Scharping] I want the CDU/CSU to have a period of  regeneration, which it needs urgently -- and that in the  opposition...!    [BILD] As things look, the next president will be Roman  Herzog. Will the SPD withdraw Johannes Rau?    [Scharping] Johannes Rau is the best candidate for this  office. In the Federal Assembly, there are enough sovereign  women and men who orient themselves toward what is best for  Germany and what is the desire of the overwhelming majority.  Mr. Kohl initially wanted Johannes Rau, then Mr. Heitmann, and  now Herzog. The first choice was and is the best.    [BILD] Must the more recent history of the SPD be rewritten  after the revelations of Brandt's notes?    [Scharping] No, the accusation that Herbert Wehner did the  work of the other side is slander. There is no evidence of  that. Willy Brandt's widow has not done herself a favor. I am  sad rather than outraged about this matter.    [BILD] Will Mrs. Seebacher-Brandt be expelled from the SPD?    [Scharping] I do not think that this is an appropriate way  to settle the conflict. There is a party disciplinary procedure  underway against her, however; I have no business interfering  with the responsible arbitration committee.</p>

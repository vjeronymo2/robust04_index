			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / UK Company News: New Coats pension manager Coats Viyella, the clothing and textiles group, has scrapped the in-house fund manager for its Pounds 1bn pension fund and is to use four independent companies. The move is part of a growing trend towards external fund management reflecting the growing complexity and diversity of investment decision making. ICI, the UK's 10th largest scheme, recently decided to close its in-house fund manager. It is understood the Coats' decision was made following significant underperformance by the pension scheme in 1993, and marginal underperformance relative to the industry average in the previous two or three years. In explaining the decision, Mr Sam Dow, company secretary, said the decision reflected the fact that 'the investment waterfront is changing considerably' rather than concerns about performance. For instance, the increasing trend towards overseas investment, particularly in emerging markets, would have required the addition of extra expertise. Also, technology has become increasingly important. 'We would have had to make a substantially greater investment in technology in order to give ourselves the same tools that other investment managers have,' he said. The company has selected Morgan Grenfell Asset Management and PDFM to run two large funds investing in stocks and bonds. It has retained Foreign and Colonial Investment Management to invest in overseas equities and M&amp;G, the unit trust managers, to achieve above-average returns in UK equities.</p>

			<p><P> February 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN ONE;  </P> <P> TIDAL WAVE REMOLDS A SCHOOL;  </P> <P> THE IMMIGRATION SURGE THAT RESHAPED THE INNER CITY IS NOW TRANSFORMING THE  SUBURBAN CAMPUS. BOTH PARENTS AND OFFICIALS ARE REELING.  </P> <P> Early each weekday morning, mothers and fathers throughout Tarzana load their  children into tony sedans, wagons and Jeeps and drive off to private schools  nearby.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, from inner-city areas miles away, busloads of students who barely  speak English arrive at the neighborhood public elementary school, Wilbur  Avenue.  </P> <P> "It used to be that everyone in my neighborhood went to Wilbur," lamented  Tarzana parent Julie Engelman, on whose West San Fernando Valley street only  one out of five families send children to the local school. "Now, no one goes  there. . . . And the more neighborhood kids leave," she added with a note of  frustration, "the more room there is for bused-in kids."  </P> <P> Despite its reputation as a good school with a fine faculty, Wilbur lost about  a dozen neighborhood students to private schools this year. The exodus sent  shock waves through Wilbur's tight-knit parent community, and more parents say  they may follow the trend to private schools.  </P> <P> Across the sprawling, 610,000-student Los Angeles Unified School District,  parent unrest over busing's impact on neighborhood schools has become a common  theme. Because of a critical shortage of classroom seats and an ever-rising  tide of immigrant children, the neighborhood school is undergoing drastic  change.  </P> <P> "There are no schools (in Los Angeles Unified) that just have neighborhood kids  any longer," said Board of Education member Roberta Weintraub. "Today, the  'neighborhood' encompasses the whole city of Los Angeles."  </P> <P> The scene is reminiscent of the late 1970s, when massive busing to achieve  racial integration brought fundamental changes in the student body at scores of  schools and, subsequently, drove thousands of white families out of the public  school system. Many families returned when court-ordered busing ended in 1981.  But today, parents in Tarzana and other suburban neighborhoods are reeling  again, although for different reasons.  </P> <P> The continuing massive wave of immigration to Los Angeles that has transformed  the inner city finally is remolding the suburbs as well. And public schools are  bearing the brunt of the demographic explosion.  </P> <P> Unlike the children of a decade ago, most of the students being bused today are  immigrants who need help in learning English. And they are being bused, not  because of a mandate to desegregate, but because their home schools are too  crowded to take them.  </P> <P> Districtwide enrollment boomed through much of the last decade, growing by  15,000 pupils last fall alone. Until recently, the burden of overcrowding was  shouldered mainly by inner-city campuses, which sacrificed playgrounds for  bungalows and switched to year-round schedules to accommodate the flood of new  students.  </P> <P> But having exhausted those alternatives -- and unable to build new classrooms  quickly enough -- the district has turned to relief measures that ask suburban  campuses to share the load. One such strategy is year-round schools for the  entire district by 1991, approved by the Board of Education earlier this month.  </P> <P> The other solution has been busing.  </P> <P> So far this year, 24,000 students -- roughly equal to the number of pupils in a  district the size of Alhambra or Glendale -- are crisscrossing the Los Angeles  school system's 600 square miles each weekday to reach an available classroom  seat.  </P> <P> Early in the morning and again in late afternoon, district buses rumble down  the freeways, carrying students near and far -- from the East Valley to the  West Valley, Bell to Bel-Air, South Gate to Canoga Park, South-Central Los  Angeles to Tarzana.  </P> <P> Currently, 300 of the district's 600 elementary, junior and senior high  campuses receive students who do not live in the neighborhood, with some  filling up to half of their total enrollments with children from overcrowded  schools.  </P> <P> Three schools have no neighborhood children, serving exclusively a bused-in  student body. They include a regular elementary school in Sepulveda and two  "newcomer centers" in Bel-Air and the Crenshaw district that help orient newly  arrived immigrant children.  </P> <P> Wilbur receives nearly half of its 700 students on buses from immigrant  neighborhoods in downtown and South-Central Los Angeles. But it was so  unprepared for the large number of limited-English-speaking children who  arrived this year that teachers had to scramble for translators and supplies,  students endured multiple classroom changes, and parents panicked.  </P> <P> "It's a real stress and strain on a school" when more than 50% of the students  are bused in from many different areas, said Jack S. Jacobson, a district  regional administrator for the West San Fernando Valley. When that happens,  parents "begin to feel they are losing their neighborhood school."  </P> <P> Parents from Wilbur have queued up to speak at Board of Education meetings  nearly every week for the last few months, drawing attention to inadequate  bilingual help, overcrowded and unsanitary restrooms, classroom disruptions and  other perceived shortcomings of the busing. Similar complaints have been voiced  in schools from Pacific Palisades to Westchester.  </P> <P> Some district officials view such complaints as racially motivated, or at the  least, shortsighted and selfish.  </P> <P> Although some Wilbur parents "show genuine concern for all of the children in  the school," said board member Rita Walters, who represents an inner-city  region with many overcrowded schools, "in others, it is more limited."  </P> <P> "The depressing side of it is that those voices and that energy are not raised  to address the problems beyond the boundary of Wilbur Avenue School," she  continued. "The problems at Wilbur are not very different from the problems of  the whole district."  </P> <P> Wilbur parents know that some administrators may view them as racists, but they  staunchly reject the label.  </P> <P> "I'm afraid that is what people want to hear, so they can turn us off," said  Garrie Katznelson, who removed her fourth-grade daughter from Wilbur late last  year. "Our school has been integrated for years. We're talking about  educational flight. Parents couldn't sit by and watch an excellent school  disintegrate."  </P> <P> Their chief complaint, the shortage of bilingual teachers and aides, reflects a  districtwide problem. But the shortfall is particularly severe in schools that  take in students from overcrowded campuses.  </P> <P> A recent district study based on 1986-87 figures showed that more than half of  the students bused that year lacked fluency in English and most were sent to  schools that had few, if any, bilingual teachers.  </P> <P> At Wilbur, nearly one-third of the students speak languages other than English  -- largely Spanish, but also Korean, Armenian, Farsi, Portuguese, Hebrew and  Cantonese. But the school has only two bilingual teachers fluent in Spanish and  English.  </P> <P> Parent Michele Kuznetsky, who has voiced concern over the inadequacy of  bilingual help but has kept her son in Wilbur, said she welcomes such cultural  diversity. "We want this kind of (integrated) education," she insisted.  </P> <P> In fact, district figures show that Wilbur has had a significant minority  enrollment for years because of a voluntary busing program that brings in black  students from the inner city and the growth of Iranian and other immigrant  groups in the West Valley.  </P> <P> But the problem this year, Kuznetsky and others say, is that the number of  bused youngsters who could not speak English jumped so dramatically -- 70  arrived on one day alone -- that the school's resources were strained to the  limit.  </P> <P> Parents, as well as some teachers, also fear that the trend toward  non-neighborhood enrollment undermines Wilbur as a place where parents and  teachers all know each other and work together for the betterment of the  school.  </P> <P> "We are losing the nucleus of our community," a veteran Wilbur teacher said.  </P> <P> Even some academicians agree that the issue is a serious one.  </P> <P> "One thing that makes a school operate, that makes a school hum, is a sense of  community," said UCLA education professor Donald Erickson, who specializes in  administrative and policy studies.  </P> <P> "But if you simply bus people around at random and you've got 15 different  languages in the school and parents (of bused youngsters) can't get involved in  school affairs, there is no concept or theme or set of values that people can  get together on," he added.  </P> <P> Thousands of students participate in voluntary busing for integration purposes,  and that "seems to work," Erickson added. But busing purely to relieve  overcrowding is, he said, "madness."  </P> <P> Nestled in a quiet residential area near two country clubs, Wilbur at one time  enrolled 1,000 students, all from the Tarzana-Reseda area. Principal Frank  Specchierla, who recently left on a sabbatical, said enrollment took a nose  dive through the 1970s, in part because of parents' fears of mandatory  desegregation and because sharply rising real estate prices discouraged  families with young children from moving in.  </P> <P> Today, Wilbur has a 50-member PTA board -- huge by today's standards. It is the  kind of school where parents can throw a wine-and-cheese reception and raise  $20,000 to outfit a computer lab, or generate another $25,000 through candy and  T-shirt sales to pay for field trips, scholastic magazine subscriptions and  other "enrichments" that were cut out of most school budgets years ago.  </P> <P> "If we lose these parents, you can kiss that goodby. And (all of) the kids are  going to lose out," said Dotty Spector, a PTA co-president.  </P> <P> Even parents who have fled the school stress that they remain strong believers  in public education.  </P> <P> Katznelson, for example, taught public school for 17 years and attended public  schools herself.  </P> <P> "I'm a public-school advocate," she declared over lunch in a bustling cafe near  her Tarzana home recently. "I never imagined my children going to anything but  a public school."  </P> <P> But she changed her mind abruptly when her daughter's classroom was changed and  she was seated next to students who barely spoke English in a class led by a  teacher who could not speak Spanish.  </P> <P> The majority of the bused-in pupils arrived after "norm day," Oct. 6, the date  by which schools had to turn in official enrollment counts and finalize their  staffing needs, Specchierla said.  </P> <P> Most of the newcomers are recent immigrants from El Salvador, Nicaragua, Mexico  and other Latin countries. Teachers note that some of the pupils had little  prior schooling before immigrating to the United States.  </P> <P> But Wilbur was far short of having enough bilingual teachers, aides or books.  So teachers and students who spoke only English had difficulty communicating  with the students who spoke mostly Spanish.  </P> <P> "It's been very hard," said fourth-grade teacher Donna Quan, whose inability to  speak Spanish hampered teaching for half of her class of 29 students. "I have  to ask the students who speak some English to help me out. That is  frustrating."  </P> <P> Moreover, classes had to be reorganized several times because new students kept  trickling in. Some neighborhood youngsters had to change teachers three times  within the first two months of school.  </P> <P> "My daughter cried every day not knowing when she would be moved," said the  mother of a fifth-grader who asked not to be identified.  </P> <P> For Katznelson, the last straw was seeing her 8-year-old daughter's schoolwork  deteriorate. Because the girl's limited-English-speaking classmates were  constantly asking her questions -- What did the teacher say? What page are we  on? How do you do this exercise? -- she didn't have time to finish her own  work, her mother said. Katznelson said her daughter wanted to help them but, in  the end, found the situation too exasperating.  </P> <P> So last October, the Katznelsons decided to enroll their child in a nearby  private school.  </P> <P> "It was a very difficult decision," recalled Katznelson, who had been one of  the school's most active parent supporters. "I always felt the finest teachers  were in public schools. . . . But the quality of education had gone down. Not  because of the teachers -- the teachers are outstanding. But I feel they were  put in an impossible situation, and it affected everybody, all of the  children."  </P> <P> Malka Tasoff, a leader of the ad hoc group Parents of Wilbur, which has  pressured the school board to help the school, said parents would like  assurances that no additional children will be bused in next year, to give the  school time to adjust to this year's sudden influx.  </P> <P> "At least let them be bused to a school that is working," she said. "Don't  chase away the people (neighborhood parents) who make it work."  </P> <P> Tasoff's two children continue to attend Wilbur. But she notes that eight of  the 11 children living on her street, Pasadero Drive, go to private schools.  </P> <P> "That kills me," she said. "There ought to be a campaign by the school district  to pull these people in. They are an incredible resource for the school. Wilbur  is a poor school, but what made it a model is parental involvement."  </P> <P> Parents acknowledge that conditions are slowly improving. More bilingual aides  have been hired and additional bilingual materials finally arrived early this  year.  </P> <P> In addition, in part because of the parents' protests, the district recently  established a centralized system for recruiting bilingual classroom aides.  Wilbur Principal Specchierla said finding qualified candidates was so difficult  in the West Valley that last year he resorted to hanging around a local  unemployment office to find a Spanish-speaking aide.  </P> <P> Wilbur parents continue to devote considerable energy to attracting  neighborhood children back to Wilbur, however, believing that building up the  local enrollment will go a long way toward remedying the school's problems.  </P> <P> Critics suggest that the parents ought to pay more attention to accepting the  idea that inner-city children are, and will continue to be, a part of their  school.  </P> <P> Jo Bonita Perez, a multicultural education specialist for the office of the Los  Angeles County superintendent of schools, has worked with many Los Angeles-area  schools where students are bused in because of overcrowding. Although she was  not speaking specifically of Wilbur, she contended that at many such schools,  human relations are ignored.  </P> <P> "The kids who are bused in walk in like tourists," she said. "What is done to  make them feel they are a part of the school and belong there? And what is done  to help the neighborhood kids feel comfortable receiving and accepting them?  Little to nothing, most often."  </P> <P> Perez noted that at many schools, neighborhood students walk in through the  main gate while the bused youngsters arrive through a separate entrance nearer  to where their buses stop. "There is division right there at the start," she  said.  </P> <P> At Wilbur, the bused students enter through a gate near the parking lot and  walk directly to the cafeteria for the free hot breakfast most are qualified to  receive. They also sit together for a subsidized lunch.  </P> <P> And out on the playground, fifth-grade teacher Polly McDowell said, "there is  almost total segregation. The black kids have their own little group and the  Spanish kids go into their little groups. It's comfortable for them."  </P> <P> McDowell said she is concerned about the "isolation" of the bused youngsters.  "There are certain things," she said, "that make you feel inferior."  </P> <P> Some neighborhood students reach out to the newcomers. Andrew Kim, 10, a  Korean-American student in Paul Greenwalt's fifth-grade bilingual classroom,  brings a Spanish-English dictionary to school to help him communicate with his  Spanish-speaking classmates.  </P> <P> "When we're out on the yard, I hear kids say things in Spanish and I look it  up. When the teacher says (a command) in English, I say it in Spanish.  Sometimes I help Rosa here," he said, motioning toward a girl sitting across  the table from him.  </P> <P> Kim's classmate, Sonia Martinez, who rides the bus to Wilbur from South-Central  Los Angeles, said she likes the school but would rather attend classes closer  to home.  </P> <P> "I want to be near my house," she said, because "if something (bad) happens, I  can go home."  </P> <P> A Guatemala native who has attended Wilbur for three years, Sonia said she  feels comfortable at the school; she serves as a bus monitor and cafeteria  helper, and is even considering becoming a teacher when she grows up. But she  cannot stay late or join in after-school activities because the bus leaves  promptly after the last bell at 2:30 p.m.  </P> <P> That is a common lament of students who must ride the buses to distant  campuses, and it presents one more barrier between the traveling and the  neighborhood students, parents and teachers alike said.  </P> <P> In addition, language differences, work schedules and the long distance between  home and school make it difficult for the parents of the traveling students to  become involved in school affairs.  </P> <P> Parent leaders at Wilbur say they have tried to reach out to their counterparts  in the sending schools, such as through letters home in Spanish about PTA  meetings. But so far the response has been discouraging.  </P> <P> A few schools have tried to schedule parent meetings at schools closer to the  neighborhoods the pupils travel from, "but I haven't heard of schools with  overwhelming success," said Gordon Wohlers, the district administrator in  charge of overcrowding-relief programs, such as busing. "Obviously, the  deterrent is the distance."  </P> <P> Critics of the district busing program mention those and other problems when  they argue that the greatest hardships are being borne by the students riding  the buses, not by neighborhood youngsters.  </P> <P> Associate Supt. Paul Possemato, who is studying Wilbur parents' complaints,  said parents who fear that their children lose valuable learning time when they  try to help a limited-English classmate may not have a legitimate complaint: "I  find that difficult to understand, instructionally. There is tremendous benefit  in that kind of cooperative relationship."  </P> <P> One finding of a recent report by the district's Program Assessment and  Evaluation Branch shows that the academic achievement of pupils bused to  integrated schools is much lower than that of neighborhood students.  </P> <P> "We've been complaining about these things for years," said the Rev. Horacio  Quinones, who heads the Parent Academy for Quality Education, a grass-roots  effort to train Latino parents to be more involved in schools. "The difference  now is that the ones complaining are the receiving schools, who say we are  lowering their academic achievement. So they're getting the attention.  </P> <P> "But if you do not deal with the Hispanic community, the end result is that  everybody is going to be affected. Our children are not going to go away."  </P></p>

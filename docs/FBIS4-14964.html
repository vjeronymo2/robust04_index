			<p>BFN     [Text] The eighth round of talks started in Chisinau  Tuesday on the status and withdrawal of the Russian 14th Army.  The previous round was held last November.    The Moldovan chief negotiator, ambassador to Moscow Anatol  Taran, told Interfax that the deadline for the withdrawal of the  Russian Army remained the only unresolved issue. In his words,  "all other problems have been practically resolved" and the  draft treaty "nearly ironed out."    "If this round of talks succeeded in determining the  deadline  for the withdrawal of the army, this would make a significant  progress," Taran said. Thus far, he said, "the two sides hold  their ground and it would be difficult to work out a compromise."    Taran also said that the two sides discussed the  contribution  Moldova could make to the housing of the army following its  withdrawal. The Moldovan delegation agrees to raise the cash  from two sources, selling the flats of leaving Russian officers  and auctioning some of the army's realties.    Taran said that the Russian delegation wanted Kishinev  [Chisinau] to add a third source, money from the Moldovan state  budget. Moldova, permanently hard up, said it could not afford  it.    Taran also said that his country had invited members of the  CSCE permanent mission members in the Republic to be present at  the talks as observers. The Russian negotiators did not think  their presence essential and suggested that the mission could be  informed on the results of the talks when they ended.    The two sides had agreed thus far that Transdniestria  representatives would be present at the talks as observers.</p>

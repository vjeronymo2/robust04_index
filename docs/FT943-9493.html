			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / Sticks and carrots for Venezuela's banks: Selective assistance and pressure is on offer to the troubled financial institutions Venezuela's government, confronting a third phase of the banking crisis which erupted in January, has refined its approach to dealing with ailing financial institutions. Instead of providing massive aid to the latest batch of troubled banks, or simply closing them down as it did to others earlier this year, the administration of President Rafel Caldera decided this week to apply a selective programme of assistance and pressure. The current crop of troubled banks is made up of eight institutions suffering from varying problems, including three of the country's most important commercial banks: Banco de Venezuela, the second-biggest bank, Banco Consolidado and Banco Progreso. Total deposits at these three banks were Dollars 1.7bn (Pounds 1.09bn) at the end of June, or about 20 per cent of all commercial bank deposits, excluding those banks in which the government has already intervened. Other banks in the current crisis are smaller institutions such as Banco Republica, and Banco Italo-Venezolano, which a group of Venezuelan investors bought from the government in 1991. Even the new slimmed-down strategy does not come cheap. The government took control of Banco de Venezuela on Monday, appointing its own president and providing about Dollars 294m to recapitalise the bank. The bank, now 104 years old, was previously one of the country's most solid and prestigious financial institutions. In mid-1993 it was taken over by a group headed by Mr Jose Alvarez Stelling, who also controls Banco Consolidado. The group included Mr Orlando Castro, a Cuban-born Venezuelan whose Latinoamericana group of banking and insurance companies includes Banco Progreso. The government is providing a total of Dollars 429m for Banco Consolidado and Banco Progreso. In return for what the government hopes will be temporary support to these banks, the owners or major stockholders have pledged some of their personal assets as guarantees. The government is demanding that banks receiving assistance take several measures, including the sale of domestic and foreign assets, mergers (in the case of Progreso and Republica), and cost reductions. The administration wants to avoid the impression, at all costs, that it is 'giving away' money to wealthy bankers, an image retained by many Venezuelans from the bail-out programme earlier this year. In the case of some of the smaller banks, the major shareholders have agreed to raise their capital bases on their own, and can thus avoid direct government control. In contrast to the earlier two crises, the eight banks remain open and, so far, depositors have not panicked. The government believes it has learned from the previous phases of the banking crisis. The first critical moment came in January, when Banco Latino, then the country's second-largest bank, failed and was taken over by the government. The impact of Latino's closure drained confidence in most of the nation's banking system, caused runs on some institutions and convinced the government that it should provide billions of dollars in assistance to keep ailing banks afloat. By mid-June, the administration realised that much of its assistance (which reached Dollars 6bn to Dollars 7bn) was going into a financial black hole. In some cases, major shareholders of banks receiving government aid reportedly used part of the money to pay off obligations held by themselves or associates. In others, government money was being recycled to other weak banks. At the same time, some banks benefiting from the bail-out cash did not take steps to cut costs, re-capitalise or otherwise improve their financial situation. On June 14, in the second phase of the crisis, the government intervened and shut eight financial institutions and their subsidiaries. By the end of the month, it assumed de facto control over the entire financial system by decree. The government and the banking sector are trying to convince the public that the latest strategy will work and that no other banks are in danger of failing. Not many people are willing publicly to oppose the administration on this delicate point. Venezuela has 50 commercial banks, including nine that were taken over earlier this year, and the eight receiving government attention this week. In the past, owners of many Venezuelan banks were able to operate in an environment where government supervision was ineffective, thus allowing abuses to accumulate. Poor management, excessively rapid growth in an inflationary environment, huge unsupervised operations offshore and policies such as failing to write off bad loans and making large loans to shareholders and associated companies rank among the key elements. This was exacerbated by an economic recession that began last year and is deepening. This put heavy pressure on weak loan portfolios. However, some businessmen and bankers believe that there are other weak financial institutions in the system and that the only way to solve the problem once and for all is to close the doors of troubled banks and liquidate them.</p>

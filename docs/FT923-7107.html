			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / Peres calls for 'meaningful' Arab talks MR SHIMON Peres, Israel's foreign minister, said yesterday the Israeli government was committed to a 'meaningful dialogue' with its Arab neighbours and wanted to move quickly to deal with issues of substance. He also said it would be 'tragic' if Arab participants did not join constructively in Middle East peace talks due to resume early next week in Washington. Arab officials were due to meet in Damascus yesterday to discuss tactics for the sixth round of talks since the US-sponsored Middle East peace effort was launched in Madrid last October. Mr Peres said it was a 'tragic mistake on the part of the Arabs to appear negative, demanding, conditioning, postponing'. He urged the Palestinians in particular to join Israel in the search for peace without delay. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's new prime minister, has called for an interim self rule agreement with the Palestinians within 12 months, and elections for a 'self-governing authority' in the West Bank and Gaza by next April. However, he infuriated Palestinians last week when he said that Israel was pressing ahead with 11,000 homes already under construction in the territories. Palestinian officials threatened to postpone participation in the Washington talks in protest at President Bush's decision to release billions of dollars in loan guarantees to Israel without securing agreement for a complete freeze on Jewish settlements. 'We are seeking a unified Arab stand to demand US clarification on the deal and guarantees of a complete freezing of all settlements on all Arab occupied lands, including Jerusalem, before the start of the August 24 talks,' Mr Yassir Abed Rabbo, a senior PLO official said in Amman. The PLO has indicated it will instruct the Palestinian delegation not to negotiate Palestinian autonomy without unequivocal Israeli commitment to stop all settlement buildings. The Palestinians will also demand clarifications from the Israel and the US on the status of East Jerusalem. The US has stipulated that the holy city be discussed later. But the Palestinians are demanding that it be dealt with as part of the occupied territories at all stages of the peace talks.</p>

			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / UK Company News: BWD advances 77% to Pounds 3.08m BWD Securities, the USM-traded financial services group, increased pre-tax profits by 77 per cent from Pounds 1.74m to Pounds 3.08m in the year to November 30. Turnover for the West Yorkshire-based company increased to Pounds 14.5m (Pounds 10.4m), while earnings per share expanded 73 per cent to 11.1p (6.4p). A final dividend of 2.5p makes a total of 4p, up 25 per cent. Mr Christopher Broadbent, chief executive, said that improved sentiment on stock markets had helped growth, coupled with a switch to equities by private investors from banks and building societies as interest rates fell. Total funds under management at the year end were Pounds 1.63bn, after a 36 per cent increase in discretionary funds to Pounds 315m and a 44 per cent advance in Pep funds to Pounds 65m. The Capital for Companies offshoot raised more than Pounds 39m (Pounds 9m). With another Pounds 30m raised this financial year, fee income from business expansion scheme activity would continue until 1998. Recurring fee income in the year increased by Pounds 1m to Pounds 2.8m.</p>

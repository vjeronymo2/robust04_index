			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Notwithstanding comments supporting the 2.25 safety factor,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA has determined that under its statutory mandate, it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary to specify higher safety factors for carbon fiber  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> containers. In adopting these more stringent requirements, NHTSA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sought the advice of RSPA, which has accumulated significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> experience and expertise through its efforts to regulate the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safety of pressure vessels used to transport hazardous materials.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Specifically, NHTSA has adopted RSPA's recommendation not to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specify the 2.25 safety factor for carbon composite containers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The more stringent safety factors being adopted are consistent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with RSPA's longstanding approach to initially adopt conservative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements and subsequently modify the requirements, if further  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> real-world safety data become available supporting less stringent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations. NHTSA has determined that applying this approach to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the safety factors for carbon fiber containers is necessary,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> since carbon fiber containers have not been used extensively in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> motor vehicle applications. The agency believes that the higher  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safety factors are justified until further data are developed and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> become available on the use of carbon fiber containers in motor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicle applications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA acknowledges that using such a safety-oriented  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approach may result in costlier and heavier carbon fiber  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> containers. However, the agency believes that the requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> being adopted will not preclude the introduction and effective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use of this new technology. Overall, the agency believes that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the safety factors being specified for carbon fiber containers,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> along with the remaining safety factors it has adopted from NGV2  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for other materials, will result in safe CNG containers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As for AAMA's comment, NHTSA shares that association's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerns about restricting future developments. However, based  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on comments by the container manufacturers and other Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies, the agency believes that few, if any, designs beyond  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those accounted for in NGV2 are planned. If a new container  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technology is developed, the agency will evaluate its safety in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the context of a petition for rulemaking to amend the Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safety standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA has decided not to adopt the catch-all high level  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safety factor, which could allow containers incorporating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> materials or designs that have not been incorporated in NGV2 and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> thus might be detrimental to safety. The agency further believes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that it would be inappropriate, at this time, to add a catchall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> factor. While such a proviso would facilitate innovation and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> design change, the agency agrees with commenters that specifying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such a catchall might be detrimental to safety, since untested  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designs and materials would be permitted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Hold Time Interval  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the NPRM, NHTSA proposed that during the burst test,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> elevated pressure would have to be sustained for 60 seconds. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency noted that while RSPA regulations also specify a 60-second  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period, NGV2 requires a 10-second hold time interval once the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maximum pressure is obtained. The agency believed that because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NGV2 includes additional tests to qualify container designs and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the agency was not proposing these additional tests, a shorter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hold time would not be suitable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA received six comments addressing the appropriate hold  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time interval. All commenters except EDO believed the 60 second  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hold time requirement was not necessary. EDO stated that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement was ``tough but reasonable.'' NGVC, Brunswick, PST,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and ARC stated that specifying the hold time at 60 seconds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instead of 10 seconds would not compensate for the lack of other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NGV2 required tests. NGVC stated that the ten second hold time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interval is not intended as a test of container strength, but as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the time for the pressure in the container to stabilize. PST  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stated that along with the 3.5 safety factor, the 60 second hold  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time would make an already conservative test even more stringent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After reviewing the comments and other available  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information, NHTSA has decided to specify a hold time of 10  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seconds instead of 60 seconds. The agency notes that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposal was based on a misperception of the hold time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement's purpose. As the commenters stated, the hold period  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is included only to stabilize the pressure. It is not used as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surrogate for initial burst strength. Therefore, the reduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in hold time will not affect the test's stringency. In addition,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the agency anticipates issuing a SNPRM that would propose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional performance requirements to evaluate other aspects of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a CNG fuel container's integrity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Sequential Testing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the NPRM, NHTSA proposed that a container that passed the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pressure cycling test would then be subjected to the burst test.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In proposing that the same fuel container be used in both the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pressure cycling and burst tests, the agency believed that it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be appropriate to establish that the fuel container  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintained its initial strength after being subject to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> durability test.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Seven commenters addressed the issue of using the same  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> container for both the pressure cycling and burst tests. NGVC,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AAMA, Comdyne, Pressed Steel Tanks, and Amoco stated that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requiring the same fuel container for both tests would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unrealistic and overly stringent, because in real world  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> situations, a container would not be subject to pressure cycling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and burst conditions sequentially. They stated that otherwise  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unnecessary material would have to be added to strengthen the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> container so it could meet the burst test requirement after the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pressure cycling test. These commenters believed such additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> material would significantly increase the container's cost and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> weight to the extent that the container would no longer be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> economically viable to produce. They further stated that most  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> containers that are currently produced to meet NGV2 or RSPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements would not be able to meet this requirement. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contrast, EDO and Metropolitan Suburban Bus Authority (MSBA)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> favored the use of sequential testing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After reviewing the comments and other available  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information, NHTSA has decided not to require sequential testing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency believes that using different containers in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pressure cycling and burst tests will provide an adequate measure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of both the container's initial strength and its durability over  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its life, without imposing new cost burdens on the industry. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency notes that such testing is consistent with the way in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which industry currently tests under both NGV2 and RSPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards. The agency further notes that in testing for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance with some FMVSSs, the agency allows a manufacturer to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use a separate vehicle or component for different tests within a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard. For example, three vehicles are crashed in Standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No. 301, and different brake hoses are used for various tests in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Standard No. 106,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Brake Hoses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> 4. Failure Criteria  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> In the NPRM, NHTSA proposed that to pass the burst test, a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> container would have to meet the same two performance criteria as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the pressure cycling test: (1) No leakage, and (2) no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permanent circumferential deformation of more than one percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose of these requirements was to provide objective means  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to evaluate a container's compliance strength. NGV2 includes the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> no leakage criterion, but not the one percent circumferential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deformation criterion. As explained in the section on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pressure cycling test, the deformation requirement was based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SAE Recommended Practice J10, August 1985, which addresses the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance of metal air brake reservoirs. The agency proposed a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> circumferential deformation limit to aid in determining a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> container's impending failure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After reviewing the comments, NHTSA is adopting the no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> leakage criterion to evaluate failure of the burst test. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency has decided not to adopt the one percent deformation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criterion because the agency believes that circumferential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deformation is not a meaningful measure of a fuel container's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impending failure in the burst test. See the section above  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regarding the pressure cycling test for a more comprehensive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussion about the agency's decision not to adopt the pressure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deformation criterion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

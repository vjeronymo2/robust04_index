			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tripoli, al-Nowar [February] 2, JAMAHIRIYAH NEWS  AGENCY -- The assistant official spokeswoman for the French  Foreign Ministry Catherine Colonna said that France hopes that  the new Algerian president, Liamine Zeroual, will carry out a  genuine political dialogue with all Algerian parties. This will  serve to place Algeria on the road to democracy and national  reconciliation.    The JAMAHIRIYAH NEWS AGENCY's Arab affairs editor commented  on this saying:    These official French statements constitute a blatant  interference in the internal affairs of friendly Algeria. At  the same time, France has acted in a silly manner towards  Algeria. The editor added that if France had, for example,  called for building cordial relations with Algeria then this  would be reasonable. However, for officials to meddle in an  internal matter which concerns Algeria, as was the case with the  statements made by the French spokeswoman, then the matter is  both silly and constitutes a blatant interference in Algeria's  internal affairs.    The editor said that if no one could be found to say this  then the Great Jamahiriyah will say it [word indistinct] in a  loud voice, for France continues to see itself as a colonial  power and as if it is its mentor. It is as if Algeria belongs  to France and Algeria sacrificed one million and a half martyrs  in the battles for independence and freedom against French  colonialism.    Such interference, propelled by a colonialist bias, can only  serve to increase the anger we feel against France, its  `colonial master' mentality, and the spirit of a colonialist  country.</p>

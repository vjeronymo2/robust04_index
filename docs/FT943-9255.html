			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / Stock Exchange probes dealings The Stock Exchange has launched a review of trading in shares of the 12 regional electricity companies in recent weeks and has questioned several brokers about transactions which may have involved insider dealing. Brokers said the Stock Exchange appeared particularly interested in whether some directors had purchased shares in rival companies. Share prices soared yesterday after the report showed price controls less onerous than were thought likely until recently. The Stock Exchange declined to comment yesterday. But it is understood that the exchange, as a routine matter, conducts special surveillance of trading in a company's shares when it knows a price-sensitive statement is about to be released. Such statements would include profits reports, notice of an acquisition or disposal, or - in a regulated industry - news of regulatory changes. Dealers said that the purchase by an electricity company director of shares in a rival did not mean that inside information was available. Such a decision could have been based on detailed knowledge of the industry and its likely prospects, similar to the information available to industry analysts at a securities house. However, if the director was privy to information not available to knowledgeable individuals, and used that information to purchase shares, insider dealing may have occurred. ESN Pension Scheme, the company which invests the regional power companies' pension funds, yesterday said it had stringent rules on the purchase of electricity company shares by employees. Employees may not buy the shares except those offered in an initial 'free' offer. If they do buy shares, they must do so through a broker selected by ESN which reports all transactions to senior management. Any share purchases must be reported to management.</p>

During the course of their meeting, which passed in an  atmosphere of mutual openness and understanding, they spoke  about the current EU policy toward the peace process and the  resolution of the crisis on the territory of former  Bosnia-Herzegovina, and also about Serbia-Greece bilateral  relations and cooperation, the Serbian president's office has  announced.    It was concluded that a fair and permanent solution to the  situation in former Bosnia-Herzegovina could be reached only if  the peace option prevailed over the war option and if the  international community displayed an unbiased attitude and  readiness to treat equally the rights and interests of all the  three warring sides in this area.    President Milosevic stressed that the European Union had a  huge political obligation with regard to lifting the sanctions  against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, in light of the fact  that the Serb side has accepted its peace plan, the integral  part of which is the lifting of the embargo. The European Union  ought to fulfill its part of the obligations from that plan,  particularly because it is impossible to resolve the crisis in  this area without equal treatment of all the sides by the  international community.    It was also stressed that maintaining sanctions against our  country encourages those forces that are trying to realize their  goals by force. It is of vital interest for all the countries  suffering damage caused by the application of the economic  blockade against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to launch an  initiative as soon as possible for the lifting of the embargo.  This is in the interest of the normalization of economic trends  and the overall stabilization of the political situation in the  region, in which the European Union should play an active role.    It was stressed that bilateral relations between Serbia and  Greece were developing well despite the imposed limitations,  which confirms the firm friendship and shared interests of the  Serbian and the Greek nations.    The talks were also attended by Federal Deputy Prime  Minister  Zeljko Simic.</p>

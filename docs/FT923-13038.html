			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: W Australian nickel project delayed DOMINION MINING has delayed until early next year a decision about possible development of its Yakabindie nickel deposit in Western Australia, which could meet up to 3 per cent of annual western world demand for the metal. However, Dominion said yesterday it already had two offers from potential joint venture partners to take a share in the ADollars 470m (Pounds 180m) project. Marketing plans and a feasibility study had taken longer than expected to prepare, so the forecast decision date of August this year was now unlikely to be achieved. 'A decision on full commitment to the project is unlikely before early 1993,' it said. Yakabindie would, when fully on stream, produce about 21,000 tonnes of nickel a year from 6m tonnes of ore. Dominion said the project would be able to produce a unique sulphide concentrate containing more than 20 per cent nickel and with minimal impurities. This would eliminate the need for subsequent costly and complex nickel refining stages in the production of a saleable nickel feedstock. Dominion said a nickel iron oxide calcine product from Yakabindie had been 'widely exposed' to the stainless steel industry, where it 'has met with widespread technical acceptance'. Most nickel is used in stainless steel production. Sales contracts were being negotiated with a number of stainless producers, but 'progress has been slower than expected because of the weakness of the international nickel and stainless steel markets.' Dominion previously suggested that it would be willing to see its share in the project fall below 50 per cent. 'Numerous expressions of interest have already been made by prospective financiers,' it said yesterday.</p>

			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / House of Fraser on the block: Flotation designed to enable Fayed brothers to repay debts but keep Harrods THE FAYED brothers yesterday announced plans for the flotation of the House of Fraser department store chain next year - excluding the Harrods flagship. The brothers believe the flotation of the 59-store chain will enable them to pay off their debts while allowing them to keep Harrods, always seen as the main object of their takeover of House of Fraser. They acquired the group for around Pounds 600m in 1985 after a battle with Lonrho, the conglomerate. House of Fraser said the Fayeds had been advised by SG Warburg, their advisers, that a flotation was in the best interests of the chain and of the brothers. The group had not ruled out the possibility of a trade sale, but 'we are not anticipating that'. Warburg is thought to have valued the stores at more than Pounds 500m, although analysts expressed scepticism at this. Mr Ali Fayed stepped down as chairman of the stores chain yesterday and will be replaced by Mr Brian McGowan, former chief executive of Williams Holdings. The flotation is expected by early summer next year. The Fayeds will retain no stake in the stores and their holding company name will be changed. As well as Harrods, the brothers will retain control of Turnbull and Asser, the upmarket shirtmaker, the Kurt Geiger shoe chain, the Barkers shops and office complex in Kensington, the Carlton Highland Hotel in Edinburgh, and the Harrods depository in London. A management buy-out of the stores in April is believed to have failed because the management was unable to raise the Pounds 320m asking price. In the same month, the Fayeds sold their 10.6 per cent stake in the Sears retailing group, rousing speculation that the group was in financial difficulties with debts of about Pounds 650m. House of Fraser group denied yesterday the Fayeds were under financial pressure, and said they had arranged a refinancing in April. Before taking on the job, Mr McGowan insisted that he should be able to resign without having to give any notice to the Fayeds. 'That preserves my independence.' Mr Derek Higgs, managing director of SG Warburg, asked Mr McGowan to take up the non-executive chairmanship a month after the bank had satisfied itself that the stores were a good candidate for flotation.

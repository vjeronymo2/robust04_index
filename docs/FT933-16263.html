			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / Major to be pressed for July by-election THE GOVERNMENT will this week come under strong pressure to set July 29 as the date for the Christchurch by-election. The Liberal Democrats have indicated that they are ready to break with tradition and seek to move the by-election writ in the Commons themselves if Mr John Major seeks to delay the poll until September. Mr Major has delayed the by-election because of the potentially devastating impact on party morale if the Conservatives' 23,000 majority is overturned. But the government may well pre-empt the Liberal Democrats because MPs are expected to break for their long summer recess before July 29. The prime minister is also being advised by colleagues that a defeat in September would further sour the mood at the Conservatives' autumn conference in Blackpool, increasing the pressure on his own position.</p>

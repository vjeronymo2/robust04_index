			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Nadir threatens to sue British authorities for Pounds 4.5bn Mr Asil Nadir, the fugitive businessman, yesterday stepped up his war of words by threatening to sue the British authorities for Pounds 4.5bn he claimed had been lost as a result of the collapse of his former company, Polly Peck International. Speaking from the local headquarters of PPI in northern Cyprus, Mr Nadir also claimed that the UK authorities, using unnamed intermediaries, had offered to drop the case against him 'under certain circumstances'. Mr Nadir's remarks, reported by the Turkish government news agency, were dismissed by the British government. The Home Office said last night: 'If Mr Nadir has any concerns, he should take them up with the Police Complaints Authority.' Mr Nadir travelled to Cyprus in May after illegally jumping bail conditions in the UK where he faces charges of theft and false accounting for Pounds 34m. His latest tirade appears aimed at winning public support in Turkey, where he is mounting a last-ditch legal battle to prevent administrators at accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand from disposing of the remaining PPI companies in Turkey and northern Cyprus. The administrators are trying to tie up the sale of Meyna, the Turkish fruit business which contributed most of PPI's reported profits in the near and Middle East. An Izmir-based soft drinks company confirmed last week it was negotiating to buy the PPI fruit and packaging concern. It emerged yesterday that the Turkish courts are planning to delay a hearing, originally set for January, over the administrators' claims to AN Graphics, a disputed Istanbul printing company, apparently after an intervention by Mr Nadir's lawyers. Yesterday he repeated his threats to travel to Turkey to pursue his business interests, and revealed plans for new investments in the fruit business and electronics in northern Cyprus. Elections are being held in northern Cyprus next week. Opposition parties have complained in earlier elections that Mr Nadir has used money from the local PPI companies to support the ruling party. As administrators prepare to report to the PPI creditors, Mr Nadir has thrown up a barrage of legal obstacles in an apparent bid to put the administrators off his scent, and delay the sale of the remaining PPI assets. His lawyers recently released an internal memo prepared by the administrators Coopers &amp; Lybrand, in which the word 'bribe' is used in connection with equipment held by customs in Istanbul. Earlier this month, Mr Michael Jordan, one of the joint administrators, was woken in his hotel room by Turkish authorities and ordered to appear before the Istanbul public prosecutor the following morning. A detention order was issued by the public prosecutor for all three administrators and five other officials on request from Mr Nadir's lawyer. It was subsequently cancelled. In the often frustrating three-year task to recover PPI assets, the administrators say they have gone out of their way to win the co-operation of the local management. Mr Nadir's actions highlight the problems of working in a legal system which is not always transparent. 'It has been a big handicap not being an insider. Nadir has shown he still has good connections,' said one Coopers official. More than that, flattering coverage in the local Turkish press has not made the administrators' job any easier. Others involved in sorting out PPI assets, including the trustees in bankruptcy and the administrators have found themselves at odds over what constitutes a PPI asset and what belongs to Mr Nadir, who was only a company official appointed by PPI's shareholders. In northern Cyprus, a series of court injunctions remain blocking the administrators' access to Sunzest, the fruit packaging company, Unipac the packaging company in Famagusta, and two hotels. Mr Jordan's brief altercation with the Istanbul prosecutor forced him to cancel a trip to Cyprus to attend one of the court hearings. 'Around the rest of the world, he hasn't caused the administrators any trouble at all. There, the only problems were technical like the state of banana prices,' says Mr Roger White of Coopers &amp; Lybrand - referring to the sale of Del Monte Fruit, the largest of the disposals achieved by the administrators. In Turkey and especially in northern Cyprus, the administrators have been put through the hoops - they have been thrown off the premises of some of the disputed companies, and physically prevented from attending board meetings. The administrators' local lawyers have also been threatened - one occasion involving a voodoo-style incident involving a headless chicken.</p>

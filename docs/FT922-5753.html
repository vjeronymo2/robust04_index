			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / Mars loses a round in battle over ice-cream MARS, the US-owned confectionery maker, yesterday lost a round in its legal battle over the European ice cream market when the Irish High Court ruled that the Anglo-Dutch Unilever group was entitled to bar Mars products from its retail freezer cabinets. The ruling follows a European Commission decision two months ago that Langnese-Iglo, a Unilever subsidiary, and Scholler Lebensmittel, another German ice-cream maker, were acting illegally by maintaining exclusive ties with German retailers which kept Mars products out of their stores. The Commission also reached an interim decision that exclusive freezer agreements operated by Unilever - Europe's biggest ice-cream maker - infringed EC competition law. Mars yesterday sought to overturn a two-year-old Irish court injunction preventing it from putting its ice cream into freezers owned by HB Ice Cream, an Irish Unilever subsidiary. However, the High Court said the injunction did not violate EC or Irish law. Mars said it would appeal against the ruling before the Irish Supreme Court and possibly in the European Court of Justice. It also expressed confidence that the EC Commission would decide formally to prohibit exclusive freezer agreements.</p>

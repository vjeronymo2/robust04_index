			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / International Company News: Telefonica improves 17.4% in first term TELEFONICA, the state-controlled Spanish telecommunications monopoly, has reported consolidated group pre-tax profits for the first three months of 1993 of Pta19.3bn (Dollars 166.4m), a 17.4 per cent increase on the same period last year. According to figures filed with the CNMV, the Spanish stock market commission, Telefonica's group sales reached Pta306.5bn, up from Pta284.8bn in the first quarter of 1992. Earlier this month, the Telefonica parent reported first-quarter pre-tax profits of Pta18.3bn, up from Pta14.9bn last year, while it said turnover totalled Pta292bn, up from Pta270bn. The fact that group profits have overtaken the parent's will come as some relief to the company. Consolidated profits last year were hit by losses at some of Telefonica's smaller domestic service companies.</p>

			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / Humber Bridge: The review of local government structure itself faces radical revision after fierce controversy. FT reporters examine the issues When construction of the Humber bridge started in 1972 the south bank of the estuary was in Lincolnshire and the north in the East Riding of Yorkshire. In 1974 the county of Humberside was created, with the bridge at its heart and including Hull on the north of the river and Grimsby and Scunthorpe to the south. Planners believed that the physical link between the two banks would establish common interests but north and south do not seem to have developed such a county identity. If the Local Government Commission's proposals are accepted the bridge will soon run from North Lincolnshire to East Yorkshire. Humberside will be abolished.</p>

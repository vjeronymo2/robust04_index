			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / NHS trusts will be told to reveal costs Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, will next week tell National Health Service trusts to give more information about the amount they spend on management. Amid growing concern that trust hospitals and community health groups spend too much on bureaucracy, she will tell trust chief executives to give full details of management costs in their annual accounts with effect from April next year. At the Conservative party conference this week she will announce that the government may issue league tables of management spending by trusts in order to expose those that spend too much. A senior Department of Health official said last week: 'The government is determined to pile the pressure on the trusts. 'The message will be that there is no hiding place for bureaucracy, and that you have to be open and accountable about what you spend.' The assault on management costs follows a strong attack on bureaucracy in the health service by Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, at his party's Blackpool conference last week. Mr Blair said that the NHS reforms had benefited 'not the patient but the penpusher'. Concern about the issue has also been felt in the government. There are indications that the number of NHS managers rose by nearly 25 per cent in 1992. Mrs Bottomley will remind Tory delegates this week that she is committed to reducing NHS bureaucracy by axing the regional health authorities in England and paving the way for mergers of district health authorities and family health service authorities. But in recent months health department officials have completed the initial groundwork for introducing league tables of management spending by trust hospitals. In July a confidential report into spending by trusts was completed by Whitehall officials, the Trust Federation and the Audit Commision, the government spending watchdog. The report defines what an NHS manager is. The government is concerned that Labour MPs, unions and other critics have used a definition that includes medical practitioners. The report found that NHS trusts spent an average of about 6.5 per cent of their budgets on management, a figure the health department could use as a guide to how much should be spent in future. Health department officials made clear last week that the government does not have statutory powers to set a limit on management spending or to force trusts to account for it. But they were confident that Mrs Bottomley's call for management costs to be made explicit in annual accounts would be heeded.</p>

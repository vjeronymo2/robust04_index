			<p><P> January 25, 1990, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> UCLA LIBRARY OF MAPS A REAL TREASURE TROVE;  </P> <P> REPOSITORY: SPECIAL HENRY BRUMAN COLLECTION SERVES ACADEMICS, ADVENTURERS,  EXPLORERS, CITY PLANNERS AND THE MERELY CURIOUS ALIKE.  </P> <P> Sometimes UCLA's Henry Bruman Map Library -- academe's largest -- is a footnote  in an adventure.  </P> <P> That was the case in 1983 when two men, carrying what they said was a treasure  map drawn by 17th-Century pirate William Kidd, approached the library's staff.  The men explained that they hoped to find an island in the real world identical  to the island on their map. Library staff member Jonnie Hargis helped them sift  through some of the 750,000 maps in the collection. Finally, Hargis recalled,  "we found an area off the coast of Vietnam that matched the chart."  </P> <P> Convinced that the pirate's treasure was buried somewhere on Phu Quoc, a  Vietnamese-held island in the Gulf of Thailand, the men went to Thailand, where  they rented a speedboat and secretly sailed to Phu Quoc. But before the  treasure hunters could start shoveling in earnest, they were arrested by  Vietnamese officials. Held for months in solitary confinement, they were  finally released after their families bribed authorities.  </P> <P> "We get some real oddballs and a lot of idle browsers," said Hargis, who said  there is a romance or magic about maps that fascinates many people. Among the  other treasure hunters Hargis has assisted: a man looking for submerged Nazi  gold in German lakes and others seeking lost California gold mines.  </P> <P> As map librarian Carlos Hagen-Lautrup explained, the major purpose of the  library is to serve the university's academic enterprise. But it is open to the  public as well. As a result, users include everyone from an astrologer who  regularly calls asking for the precise coordinates of clients' birthplaces for  use in preparing astrological charts for people who are planning trips and want  to study street maps of Cracow or Buenos Aires before they go. And, Hargis  said, "every time there's a quake, you can count on a surge of fault maps being  pulled."  </P> <P> The makers of the movie "Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes"  found old maps of Africa in the collection that bore the colonial names in use  during the period of their film. Environmental consultants come to the library  to study maps of Los Angeles for evidence of factories or other past use that  might preclude present-day development of a particular parcel of land. And  library staff member Portia Chambliss once helped a visitor determine the  neighborhood where Charles Dickens' lame but game Tiny Tim would have probably  lived by consulting a descriptive map of London poverty from 1889.  </P> <P> Indeed, the staff prides itself on being able to find the right map -- or  nautical chart -- for almost any visitor. The only time Chambliss recalls being  stumped was when she was asked for a map of Iraq in the 15th Century that  showed climatic conditions and rainfall. "That was impossible."  </P> <P> The map library was founded in 1961 by the former chairman of the geography  department for whom it is named. It has been headed since 1962 by  Hagen-Lautrup, a Chilean-born geographer and engineer who has tried to make it  a cartographic information center, not just a map room. "It's the information  that counts, not the medium," said Hagen-Lautrup. As a result, most of the  truly old maps in the collection, with the exception of a 1600 map of Flanders,  are reproductions, not originals.  </P> <P> The library is a depository for maps issued by agencies of the U.S. government  and several other countries, Hagen-Lautrup said. But in the last decade or so,  collecting has been complicated by the skyrocketing price of maps. "Many  governments want to use maps as a source of income, especially Third World  countries," said Hagen-Lautrup, who has seen prices rise from a dollar or two  per map to $15 or $20.  </P> <P> Some maps are hard to get at any price, he said. Ostensibly because of concerns  about national security, "Colombia and Bolivia don't sell detailed maps to  anybody," he said.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by G. Kozlova: "Passports of the Former USSR Become </F> Invalid by the end of 1996"]    [Text] The principle task of the new laws passed by  the Milli Majlis [as published] at the last session is to return  to the passport its original significance as a document used for  going abroad and to introduce a new document--the identity card  of a citizen of the Azerbaijani Republic--for use within the  boundaries of Azerbaijan.    Eldar Mamedov, supervisor of the department of  administrative  and military legislation of the Supreme Soviet, which prepared  the draft laws "On Exiting the Country, Entering the Country,  and Passports," and also "On the Identity Card of a Citizen of  the Azerbaijani Republic," noted that these laws are on the  territory of the former USSR for the first time. They brought  into conformity with international standards the procedures for  entry into and exit from the country, they simplified the  issuance of the indicated documents to a maximum, they clearly  consolidated the legal position of citizens going abroad, and  also the procedure for entry into Azerbaijan and exit from it by  foreigners.    For the first time, these and many other questions  associated  with them will be decided in our country not on the basis of  departmental instructions of the MFA [Ministry of Foreign  Affairs], the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs], and the KGB,  which are not available to citizens, but on the basis of laws of  the state that are binding on both officials and citizens.    "We made the laws flexible enough and as clear as possible,  and leaving as few opportunities as possible for bureaucratic  procrastination in their fulfillment," Mamedov noted. "The law  itself proclaims the primacy of the norms of international law  in the event of any kinds of contradictions. With the adoption  of these laws by parliament, Azerbaijan took a big step on the  path to the construction of a democratic society. Azerbaijan  actually showed what attention is paid in the republic to the  fulfillment of obligations that it assumed after joining the  general declaration on human rights and other international  pacts on human rights."    The law clearly stipulates that no one can deprive a citizen  of the right to free movement through customs and border points  in a publicly safe method at any time. He can leave and return  to the country at any time.    Practically all of the previously valid obstacles are being  removed, and natural temporary restrictions are associated only  with those exceptional cases when a citizen's obligations are in  effect concerning not divulging state or military secrets, or in  the event that criminal proceedings are brought against him and  he is convicted, or if he is called up for active compulsory  military service in the established legal procedure.    A citizen's going abroad will be conducted on the basis of a  general citizen's passport, but for some officials, a list of  whom is clearly designated in law, official or diplomatic  passports will be used that are specially issued for this.  Representatives of the third branch--the Constitutional Court,  the Supreme Court, and the Higher Court of Arbitration--are  included for the first time among persons who have a right to a  diplomatic passport.    All citizens who go outside the boundaries of Azerbaijan  will  be able to enjoy not only all of their constitutional rights,  including the right to pension support, but also to carry out  their duties as citizens of Azerbaijan. It is stipulated that  they have the right to take out property that belongs to them  and their family, except for objects that have been taken out of  civilian circulation (for example, cultural valuables).    The types and procedures for issuing visas to foreigners and  the periods of their stay in Azerbaijan have been consolidated  for the first time. The second law provides for the issuance by  Internal Affairs organs, according to place of residence, of two  types of plastic identity cards for persons up to 16 years of  age and older than 16 years of age, which will be exchanged when  citizens reach 25, 35, and 50 years of age, or in the event of a  change in last name, first name, patronymic, place of residence,  family situation, military service obligations, and also if they  were lost or are worn out.    The new laws will go into effect starting on 1 January 1995,  but passports of the former Soviet Union will continue to be  valid on the territory of the republic until 31 December 1996.</p>

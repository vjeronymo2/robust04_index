			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Interior Minister Juan Briones Davila by </F> unidentified EXPRESO reporter; place and date not given]    [Text] EXPRESO interviewed Interior Minister Juan Briones  Davila to learn about the rumored reduction within special  police units. Some 150 Dincote [National Counterterrorism  Directorate] members have been reassigned to other regional  terrorism units, while the National Crime Investigative  Directorate [Dinincri] is as yet untouched.    [EXPRESO] Is it true that 30 percent of the Dincote  personnel  are being reduced?    [Briones] We are doing the following: Dincote personnel have  been sent to reinforce regional counterterrorism divisions to  improve the countersubversive action at a national level. Among  the 12 police regions are the Jecotes (Counterterrorism  Provincial Police) and the Secotes (Counterterrorism Section)  [Seccion contra el terrorismo]. We are reinforcing them to  finish off the last few subversives.    [EXPRESO] Have 30 percent of the members gone to the  Jecotes?    [Briones] Much less. They total 150 members. But we will  not remove support from the Dincote. The idea is to improve our  action at a regional level without reducing support.    [EXPRESO] But it has also been said that personnel from  other  police units will be retired.    [Briones] No. We have already announced that the police  schools will not receive new students for a determined period of  time. The schools will train personnel who are currently  holding desk jobs so that they return to police work in the  police stations.    An enormous number of people worked in the Police Staff. No  one wanted to go to the streets for fear of the terrorists.  Instead of being on the streets, they held desk jobs.    [EXPRESO] How many men are we talking about?    [Briones] About 2,500.    [EXPRESO] It is said that personnel in the Dinincri have  also  been reduced.    [Briones] No. There will be investigative police members in  each police station from now on. If the case is more  complicated or if it has national ramifications it will pass  under the jurisdiction of the Dinincri. This unit is like the  FBI in the United States which intervenes when a case goes  beyond a local jurisdiction.    [EXPRESO] But will investigative police members leave the  Dinincri?    [Briones] No, they are already in the police stations. The  Dinincri will not be touched. There is no change. I do not  know where that rumor came from. The only changes are the  normal police reassignments according to the rules.</p>

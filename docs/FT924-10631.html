Mr Mauricio Pinto, industries minister, said the government wanted to give foreign investors the same opportunities as national investors. Ecuador's economy needed the new technologies they would bring. Foreign ownership in nearly all areas of the economy would be allowed, and state-owned industries be privatised.

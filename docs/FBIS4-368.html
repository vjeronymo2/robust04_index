			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] The government of Captain Strasser in Sierra Leone  has well and truly fallen out with the German ambassador, Karl  Prinz, and wants him sent home. It all came to a head at Mr.  Prinz' reported contacts with NPFL [National Patriotic Front of  Liberia] leader, Charles Taylor, in neighboring Liberia. Taylor  is frequently accused of backing the rebels in southern and  eastern Sierra Leone. From Freetown, Victor Silva telexed this  report.    At a press briefing this afternoon, the foreign secretary,  Dr. Abass Bundu, revealed that the Sierra Leone Government had  today sent a request to Germany to recall Ambassador Prinz. Dr.  Abass Bundu said that Sierra Leone was forced to take this line  of action because of what he called the unfriendly and  undiplomatic behavior of the ambassador, adding that Karl Prinz'  behavior was prejudicial to relations between Germany and Sierra  Leone. Dr. Bundu was careful to point out that the move was not  in any way meant to disrupt relations between the two countries  nor their peoples, but was meant only to have Karl Prinz  replaced as Germany's representative here. And he has been  given a 10-day period during which he should leave.    Today's announcement by the foreign secretary comes in the  wake of press reports here culled from a German newspaper, DER  SPIEGEL, which reported that the German ambassador had visited  Charles Taylor in Gbarnga and had held private discussions with  him. Dr. Abass Bundu revealed that Karl Prinz had never  informed the Sierra Leone Government that he was leaving on this  visit, but merely sent a note to the Foreign Office saying that  he would be out of the country. The Strasser regime believes  that Foday Sankoh's RUF [Revolutionary United Front] rebels have  received arms from Charles Taylor's NPFL with their headquarters  at Gbarnga and regarded the action of Karl Prinz as covert and  not in the interest of Sierra Leone's security. Dr. Abass Bundu  said that despite efforts to get an explanation from Mr. Prinz,  he was treated with contempt by the German ambassador who,  instead, informed his office that he would be going on annual  leave on 15 April. We do not, said Dr. Bundu, discourage any  attempts at bringing peace to Liberia and Sierra Leone, but we  have the right to be informed of activities involving Charles  Taylor, a man who has caused untold misery in our country, and  Ambassador Prinz has not acted in an acceptable manner.</p>

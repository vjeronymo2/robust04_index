			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / International Company News: Murdoch mulls new equity issues MR RUPERT Murdoch, chairman of News Corp, is tempted by the recent surge in media share prices to raise ADollars 4bn to ADollars 5bn (USDollars 3.3bn) by issuing new shares to telecommunications or other strategic partners, AP-DJ reports from Sydney. News Corp last week announced plans to give existing shareholders a new class of shares that carry increased voting rights. This will allow the group to sell large parcels of conventional common stock to form strategic alliances without diluting Mr Murdoch's 30 per cent voting stake. In an interview published over the weekend in The Australian, News Corp's flagship Australian newspaper, Mr Murdoch said the company did not need additional funds at this time. However, 'this does seem to be a moment of opportunity,' he said. 'There's a bit of a frenzy developing in terms of the media and investment and it looks like it may last for a while. This may be a window of opportunity to take a quantum step forward. 'We just want to be ready to do it should that opportunity arise. We could place up to 20 per cent of the company and raise ADollars 4bn to ADollars 5bn. We would be willing to do that,' he told the newspaper. 'At today's prices we're valued at USDollars 15bn to USDollars 16bn. If we increase that by 20 per cent, that would give us enormous financial strength,' Mr Murdoch maintained. Share prices of media companies, particularly in the US, soared last week on news of a proposed merger between Bell Atlantic, a telephone company, and Tele-Communications, a cable television operator. Investors bought shares in the hope of positioning themselves to cash in on an expected linking of telephone companies, cable TV operators, information companies, media concerns and film studios. News Corp has film and satellite TV interests as well as newspaper and magazine units. The company's shares climbed 52 cents to ADollars 11.62 on the Australian Stock Exchange on Friday. Mr Murdoch said that any of the larger groups 'who buy into us would provide further financial and industry strength. 'They could give us access to new technologies and cash, or just the cash. We have a feeding frenzy at the moment and like all feeding frenzies it won't last forever,' he said.</p>

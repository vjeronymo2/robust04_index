			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Thuringian Minister-President Bernhard Vogel </F> by Bettina Baeumlisberger and Heiner Emde; place and date not  given: "Patronizing Westerners"]    [Text] [FOCUS] Why is the rift between east and west  Germans so large?    [Vogel] I doubt that it is so large. What is large is the  difference in people's lives in the two parts of Germany over  the past 40 years. This difference cannot be balanced  overnight. Furthermore, occasionally I get the feeling that some  west Germans now have expectations that they never had in the  past. People from Schleswig-Holstein and Bavaria are not  constantly hugging each other, either. The Saxons and the  Thuringians will still retain certain individual characteristics.    [FOCUS] Nevertheless, the east Germans are complaining that  the wages are adjusted too slowly and the west Germans are  complaining about excessive burdens....    [Vogel] People in Germany like to complain, in the west more  than in the east. It is not completely incomprehensible that  the east Germans are impatient. Frowning over this impatience  in western Germany is largely due to ignorance regarding the  real situation. The occasionally patronizing attitude that says  "For us it also took 40 years" is very little consolation for  those who have already waited for 40 years.    [FOCUS] The 1989-90 vision spoke of "flourishing  landscapes"; the reality are prefabs, industrial ruins, and old  ecological burdens. When will the landscapes finally start to  flourish?    [Vogel] I will not give you any specific date, but things  are flourishing, as one can see, and they are flourishing more  in the south than in the north of the new laender. In a few  years we will have fields where we will certainly be  competitive. We will soon have caught up with Saarland;  catching up with Bavaria will take a bit longer.    [FOCUS] How do you want to stimulate Thuringia's economy?    [Vogel] With a broad range of economic instruments, such as  the newly founded reconstruction bank and the industry  participation fund. This helps companies that have good  prospects to overcome their difficulties with liquidity for a  certain time. For instance, we must not immediately say that  young companies are doomed to fail because they have starting  difficulties, such as too little capital. Thuringia's great  chance lies in the technological lead in state-of-the-art  production facilities. The disadvantage: The number of jobs is  lower than in the usual facilities.    [FOCUS] Where do the differences between the south and the  north in the new laender come from?    [Vogel] Because the south is the classical industrial region  in Germany and here the structural preconditions are much more  favorable. One cannot be located more centrally than Erfurt,  right in the center of Germany. We have a lot to do to be able  to use this inheritance. Railroad tracks and roads must be  built to make use of the advantage of a central location.    [FOCUS] The classical industrial region also has ecological  burdens. Where are the billions for cleaning up the old burdens  supposed to come from? The 3.8 billion German marks [DM] in tax  revenues are already devoured by the personnel costs that the  land has to pay.    [Vogel] The Federal Government pays between 60 and 75  percent of the removal of the large old burdens. At the moment  our budget situation is as follows: Of DM100 that we pay, DM25  is tax revenues, which experience a gradually upward trend, DM25  is borrowed, and DM50 comes from the west, in particular from  the Federal Government.    [FOCUS] And now there is the election campaign. Are you not  sometimes suffering from insomnia in view of the latest election  disasters of the Christian Democratic Union [CDU]?    [Vogel] We are doing a lot of work. Therefore, I sleep  well. By the way, the two most recent elections were quite  certainly not successful for the CDU, but they did yield a few  gratifying messages.    [FOCUS] Which ones?    [Vogel] We have a high turnout once again. The Republikaner  had nothing to say, not even in Lower Saxony. And the  concentration of the voters on the two people's parties is quite  clear. We no longer have 60 percent as in Hamburg, but we are  back at 80 percent. In addition, it is a good message that the  governments are being confirmed: Minister-presidents are  winning elections.    [FOCUS] Do you still expect to have your coalition partner  in the next Thuringian Landtag, since the Free Democratic Party  of Germany [FDP] does not achieve 5 percent anymore?    [Vogel] I assume that the FDP will again enter the Erfurt  Landtag. However, I do not believe that the CDU should speak of  an absolute majority. We did not achieve it in 1990, when  conditions were quite extraordinary. Achieving it in 1994 is  not realistic. It is our goal to become the strongest party. I  would like to continue the coalition with the FDP. The FDP  wants that, too.    [FOCUS] No grand coalition?    [Vogel] I do not want that, in particular because it would  result in a weak opposition.    [FOCUS] The Thuringian Landtag elections take place at the  same time as the Bundestag elections, on 16 October. Are you  not afraid of the negative effect that Kohl might have?    [Vogel] One cannot avoid the Bundestag election and its  influence by holding elections 14 days before or 14 days later.  The decisive thing for me is that the turnout at Bundestag  elections is, on average, 10 percent higher than at Landtag  elections. This means, we will have a smaller proportion of  left-wing extremists and right-wing extremists. After all, they  go to the ballots in every kind of weather.    And regarding the alleged negative effect that Kohl might  have: I have known Helmut Kohl since 1954. Ever since then I  have heard similar things at certain intervals. For that he has  been ruling for a relatively long time! There is no reason to  hide Helmut Kohl.    [FOCUS] Does one have to pursue a different election  campaign in the east than in the west?    [Vogel] This must not and will not be done. But the new  laender must recognize themselves. Because there is hardly  anything that annoys me more than when texts are formulated or  plans are made with a patronizing attitude without us.    [FOCUS] How does the CDU want to overcome the negative  trend?    [Vogel] By concentrating on just a few topics, such as  economy, work, and internal security as well as credibility,  because the disenchantment with politics has an essential place  in the manifold lack of credibility. It is also necessary to  listen more and to provide more political leadership. Anyone  who always runs behind the voters just sees them from behind.</p>

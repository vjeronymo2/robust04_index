Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali which  on Monday circulated as an official document at the U.N.  hearquarters.    On February 9, the North Atlantic Council threatened to  launch air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs unless they  withdrew their heavy artillery 20 kilometres from the centre of  Sarajevo within ten days. NATO also demanded from the Moslem  side to place its heavy arms under U.N. control.    Sarajevo is the scene of a Moslem-Serb conflict in the  tragic  three-sided civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina among local Moslems,  Serbs and Croats.    NATO adopted its decision on possible air strikes against  the  Bosnian Serb positions under strong influence of a suspicion,  but lacking evidence, that the Serbs are responsible for the  massacre at a Sarajevo market on Febuary 5, in which, according  to Moslem reports, 68 civilians were killed and nearly 200  wounded.    "We believe that decisions, and especially those setting  ultimatums in international relations, cannot be based on  assumed guilt because any such decision would be a crime  itself," Lilic said in the letter.    He stressed the need for a peaceful settlement of the  Bosnian  conflict and assessed as alarming NATO's decision to seek  solution to the Bosnian crisis through ultimatums and the use of  force.    "It is clear that such decisions stimulate continuation of  war and that peace can be achieved only through negotiations on  equal footing," the Yugoslav president said in the letter to the  U.N. secretary-general.</p>

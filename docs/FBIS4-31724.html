			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Bosnian Foreign Minister Irfan Ljubijankic </F> by Ashraf al-'Ishari; place and date not given]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Al-'Ishari] First, what about  current developments in Bosnia in light of the international  efforts to solve the crisis?    [Ljubijankic] The situation is getting worse every day. The  Serbian forces have never respected their pledges, despite the  international pressure on them. Acts of genocide are continuing  intensively every day as well as the ethnic cleansing and the  organized rape of Bosnian women in violation of all  international norms and charters. The Serbs' siege of our  people is continuing while the international community refuses  to lift the arms embargo imposed on us so that we can defend  ourselves.    There are still innumerable excesses despite the efforts of  the UN peacekeeping forces in Sarajevo. The UN forces have not  succeeded yet in stopping the bloody battles waged by the Serbs  or the violations being perpetrated against us, especially the  massacres and the killing and displacement of children, women,  and old people.    [Al-'Ishari] Are you satisfied with the role and performance  of the Islamic and Arab countries in support of the Bosnian  people? What is your assessment of the role of the Egyptian  forces in Sarajevo as part of the UN forces?    [Ljubijankic] Yes. We have been completely satisfied with  the Islamic and Arab countries' role and their support and  backing for our people and our cause from the first day that the  battles and events erupted here. Some Islamic countries and  organizations, led by the Islamic Conference Organization, have  played a major role in supporting our cause and exposing the  Serbs' crimes and violations before world public opinion.  Moreover, some Islamic countries hastened to give material and  humanitarian aid to our forces and people. Foremost among these  countries is Egypt, whose forces are participating with the UN  forces. As to the Egyptian forces' role in Sarajevo, it is much  admired and appreciated by the Bosnian people, who are proud of  having these troops among the UN forces. [passage omitted]    [Al-'Ishari] What are the reasons for your country's  hesitant  acceptance of the cease-fire agreements, particularly the recent  ones, as demanded by the United Nations?    [Ljubijankic] We have never hesitated or rejected a UN  demand  for a cease-fire but have always had reservations about such  demands. We feared that the Serbs would legitimize their  occupation of territories in Bosnia and impose the fait accompli  by force through our acceptance of the recently announced truce.  We rejected this and conveyed our stand to the two  international meditators and the UN envoy to Sarajevo. We  frankly said that our acceptance of the European peace plan is  contingent on confirmation of the return of all the Bosnian  refugees who have fled from their cities and houses under the  pressure of Serbian attacks. The refugees' return represents  one of our most important conditions for accepting the peace  plan. If the refugees return, then this would mean rejection of  the seizure of the territories of others by force and  recognition of the Bosnians' right to their territories and  cities. The problem will be solved when this is done. [passage  omitted]    [Al-'Ishari] Are you expecting to see peace established in  Bosnia in 1994?    [Ljubijankic] [passage omitted] I personally do not expect  to  see the peace that we are seeking achieved in 1994 so quickly  and for several reasons. There are so far no clear bases or an  influential power that can convince the Serbs to respond to the  voice of reason and peace and sign the comprehensive peace  agreement. We in Bosnia would be happy if the Serbs abandoned  the notion of establishing their expansionist state by force or  if a Serbian figure convinced of the need for a dialogue with  the Bosnian leaders were to emerge. At the same time, we  categorically reject any conditions imposed on us by force.  Such a policy has proved to be a failure and will not bear  fruit as some quarters believe. On the contrary, it will only  stiffen our stand because right is on our side and we have not  usurped the territories of others by force.</p>

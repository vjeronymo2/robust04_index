			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / Palestinian team seen on Arafat visit Palestinian delegates to the Middle East peace conference were seen entering a Cairo guest house yesterday where Mr Yassir Arafat was staying, in defiance of an Israel law that bars direct contact between Palestinians under occupation and the PLO, Tony Walker reports. Later Mrs Hanan Ashrawi, the Palestinian spokeswoman, came very close to admitting openly that she had met Mr Arafat who arrived in Cairo yesterday for a medical check after a plane crash last week.</p>

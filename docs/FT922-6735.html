			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Laser printers burn bright Laser Printers produce high-quality text and graphics but at between 1.4p and 2p a page they are expensive to run and generate a great deal of waste. Now Kyocera of Japan is claiming a cost and technology breakthrough with its new 'ecologically friendly' Ecosys FS-1500 printer, available next month, which it says reduces the cost of ownership by about two thirds to 0.6p a page. Conventional laser printers need replacement printer drums periodically but Kyocera's new printer is built around an amorphous silicon (aSi) drum which is durable, scratch resistant and will last the life of the printer - even when using abrasive recycled paper.

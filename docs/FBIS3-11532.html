The signing of this agreement grants  the guerrillas the status of a belligerent force, and guarantees  that the conflicts with the government will be ruled by  international humanitarian law. Here is Monica Echeverry:    [Begin recording] [Echeverry] With a note sent by the  defense  minister and the Armed Forces commander to President Gaviria,  Colombia accepts the signing of the Geneva Convention Protocol  No. 2 following years of all-out opposition. Thus, Colombia  acknowledges that it is in a state of war.    [Gustavo Rodriguez Vargas, member of the Foreign Ministry  Advisory Commission] I believe it makes the conflict more real.  The conflict is placed within parameters that at any given  moment can be more manageable for a government.    [Echeverry] In addition to this, with the signing of  Protocol  No. 2, a code of ethics for war is established and the rebels  are given the status of a belligerent force. The rebels must  now accept the humanitarian law, which involves the presence of  a UN overseeing group in the peace talks. The agreement must be  presented to Congress, where it will be approved. Thus, the  government moves a step ahead of Samper's star proposal to  advance peace, and it also opens the doors for a new peace  dialogue with the guerrillas. [end recording]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The 11th meeting of the Joint Mexican-EC Commission,  held 28-29 April, agreed to establish a commercial subpanel that  will review, among other topics, obstacles to bilateral  relations -- specifically, bilateral market access issues -- and  will explore formulas to enhance unity.    The Commerce and Industrial Development Secretariat issued a  communique announcing the creation of the subpanel. The  communique added that in his speech in Brussels, Herminio Blanco  Mendoza, under secretary for international trade negotiations,  assessed President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's economic and  social policy, which seeks to improve the distribution of income  and combat extreme poverty.    During this meeting, Blanco Mendoza stressed the need to  create jobs and raise the competitiveness of Mexico's productive  sector. He said the government's efforts in these areas have  gotten under way through the utilization of four complementary  strategies. These strategies are: achieving macroeconomic  stability; consolidating trade opening; deregulating various  sectors of the economy; and expanding bilateral, subregional,  and multilateral negotiations to open and reinforce markets.    Foreign Under Secretary Antonio de Icaza, in turn, noted  that  new circumstances were affecting Mexico and the world, and he  stressed that Mexico was undergoing a deep-rooted transformation  to adapt to the new situation. In this regard, it should be  stressed that Mexico, besides being a founder of the European  Bank for Reconstruction and Development, has joined the  Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum and will soon join the  OECD. In addition, NAFTA will provide Mexico with the means to  consolidate structural changes and to achieve an efficient  incorporation into the world economy.    In discussing the nation's recent evolution, De Icaza  highlighted the national political agreement reached a short  time ago and the different electoral reforms and other pacts  that consolidate democracy and strengthen its institutions.    Juan Prat, general director in charge of North-South  relations, noted that greater emphasis on economic cooperation  constitutes a solution to the new situation in Latin America by  encouraging activities of mutual interest that will reinforce  regional reform.</p>

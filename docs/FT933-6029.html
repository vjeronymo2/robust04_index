			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / International Company News: Exchange rate gains help Atlas Copco climb 12% ATLAS Copco, the Swedish industrial components group, said lower interest rates and exchange rate gains contributed to a 12 per cent rise in first-half profits, despite a substantial fall in sales and orders. Profits after financial items climbed to SKr661m (Dollars 449m) from SKr590m. The favourable interest rate trend produced SKr21m in net interest income, compared with an outlay of SKr87m in the same period of 1992. Exchange rate gains increased to SKr24m from SKr10m. The group's underlying business was flattered by the depreciation of the Swedish krona, which lifted sales by 13 per cent to SKr8.93bn from SKr7.87bn and orders by 9 per cent to SKr9.34bn. Sales were sharply lower in volume terms, which pushed operating income after depreciation down 8 per cent to SKr604m. The group said improved sales in the US, south-east Asia, the Middle East and Australia failed to compensate for weak demand in most European countries. However, second-quarter operating income at SKr319m was SKr34m higher than in the first three months. Orders were also down, particularly in Europe, which only accounted for 54 per cent of orders in the latest six months, compared with 61 per cent a year ago. Orders rose in North America, Africa, the Middle East, Asia and Australia. The group's industrial technique division lifted operating profits to SKr125m from SKr88m due to rationalisation while construction and mining technique profits were unchanged at SKr84m. Profits within the compressor technique division slumped to SKr457m from SKr548m. Mr Michael Treschow, chief executive, said he expects the weak demand trend in Europe to persist, but he still forecasts 1993 profits in excess of the SKr1bn level reached last year.</p>

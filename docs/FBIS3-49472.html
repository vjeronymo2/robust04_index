			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Madelaine Albright and John  Shalikashvili started their talks in Prague by meeting Prime  Minister Vaclav Klaus. The content of the talks was aimed at  assessing the U.S. project Partnership for Peace. According to  the prime minister, the project is valued by the Czech  Government for the broad and liberal approach it offers its  participants. U.S. interest in the development of regional  cooperation, which, according to Madelaine Albright, is as  important as the Czech Republic's good relations with the United  States, was also debated.    [Begin Klaus recording] I think the American side  understands  that if we protest sometimes it is rather a protest against  certain empty regionalism, against artificial concepts that lead  nowhere. As for real and good regional relations, we, I believe,  say clearly yes. [end recording] [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Breathing Liffe into equity options - How to revive interest in an established product How do you increase sales of a product which has been around for years and which has failed to do as well as other, competing brands? Manufacturers of washing-up liquid or soap powder can quickly reach millions of potential buyers with television or radio commercials. But these forms of advertising are uneconomic and inappropriate for products which are very specialised and only appeal to a small audience. This is the challenge facing Liffe, London's financial futures and options exchange, which is trying to stimulate new interest in equity options after inheriting the product last year through its merger with London's traded options market. Equity options - which give holders the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell at a fixed price - started trading on the London Stock Exchange in 1978. In spite of the deregulation of the securities industry in the 1980s and the wide ownership of shares in the UK, however, they failed to attract enough interest to justify their own trading floor. By contrast, equity options have been far more successful in continental Europe and in Scandinavia, where the level of investment in shares is relatively low. Liffe, which is the largest financial futures and options exchange outside Chicago, believes it should be able to bring the UK level closer to those of the Continent and Scandinavia. One of the first things Liffe discovered from its market research was that in the US and in the Netherlands, it is the retail investor, and not the institutional client, who is responsible for about 70 per cent of trading volume in these instruments. In the UK, the situation is the reverse, with private investors estimated to contribute less than 20 per cent of total equity and index option volume. Developing this retail segment is essential if trading in equity options is to grow substantially, says Karin Forseke, in charge of equity products at Liffe. She has taken steps to make equity options more accessible to the public. Prices of individual equity options are now available on the BBC's teletext facility, Ceefax. In the first week of transmission, Liffe received 1,500 telephone calls about equity options. Retail investors were also given priority when Liffe conducted a review of individual equity options. The Exchange dropped four existing options and in-troduced eight new ones, leaving 70 equity options which better reflect the composition of retail and institutional portfolio holdings. Liffe has also introduced monthly seminars for private clients and has published booklets on how to use equity options. It is also improving its technology to facilitate trading. With these changes in place, Forseke and her colleagues have been visiting private-client stockbrokers in London and the provinces to encourage them, and their clients, to trade in equity options. The programme is being extended to the big financial institutions, to persuade them to use equity options to enhance the performance of their funds. Liffe does not expect investors, large and small, to change their habits overnight, but aims to double trading volume of equity options within two years. Currently, just over 1m contracts (a contract specifies the quantity of the item and the time of delivery or payment) are traded each quarter. Trading in equity options reached a high of 3.1m contracts in the second quarter of 1987, just before the global stock market crash which occurred that October. While a volume-based target is probably the most widely perceived measure of success, Forseke believes that other goals are equally important. These range from a substantial increase in the use of equity options by institutional and private clients, to increased liquidity in individual equity options. If these goals are not met by the summer of 1995, is that the end of equity options in the UK? No, says Forseke, Liffe will have to find other ways to make equity options realise their potential.</p>

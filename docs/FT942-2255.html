			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Survey of Spain - Banking, Finance and Investment (9): Domestic volumes dominate / A large stock of Spanish funds is emerging that can be tapped by outsiders It was not surprising that Madrid's Bolsa index should have shot up to record highs in January for the equity markets were performing strongly almost everywhere. What was extraordinary about the gains in Madrid was that the Bolsa's rally was driven by domestic institutions and not, as is usually the case, by foreign investors. To a great extent the foreign institutions had turned bearish about Spain at the beginning of the year because they believed that the Banesto crisis, which prompted the intervention of the Bank of Spain, would send tremors through the financial system. By a happy coincidence, domestic funds were able to take positions normally occupied by the foreigners because they were growing strongly and also because they were in the process of switching part of their fast growing investment portfolio from fixed income investment to equities. A footnote to the history of the Spanish stock markets in the first half of 1994 would read that non-residents, who had traditionally been so opportune with their Bolsa investments, had for once missed their chance. By the time the Banesto-induced panic was over, thanks to a support operation which reflected great credit on Spain's financial institutions, the markets were down and it was too late to reap profits. The main market theme in the first half of this year is that the arrival, in large volumes, of domestic funds on to the Bolsa constituted a major development that both complemented and rivalled in importance the 'mini-bang' that the Madrid market underwent in the late 1980s. The Bolsa reforms ushered in a stock exchange regulator, securities houses to replace individual brokers and a continuous market. What the onset of funds has done is to broaden the market and to provide it with an acceptable domestic support base that had been lacking in the past. But the sudden appearance of a domestic funds-driven Bolsa has implications that go beyond the Spanish market's increased liquidity. The build up of funds through the big branch networks owned by the domestic banks and savings banks in Spain, together with the management of the funds by these institutions and their investment by the in-house brokers of the same banks and savings banks, forms an arguably incestuous relationship that might raise eyebrows in the City of London. 'Warburg's Securities has to be more competitive than any one else in order to get the business from Mercury Asset Management,' says a UK-trained executive at a Madrid broking house. 'That doesn't happen here.' Argentaria, the state-controlled banking corporation, for example, has been capturing a big slice of the public sector's pension funds. Is this because Argentaria is particularly good at managing funds or is the business merely oiled by the mutual goodwill that exists in the old state company tie network? The traditionally strong bonds between Spain's main financial institutions and domestic industry additionally begs the question of what sort of equity investments the in-house brokers are likely to make. It would be surprising if funds managed by investment units at Banco Santander and at Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, the two biggest players in the sector, as well as those managed by Banco Central Hispano, Argentaria and the other leading banks, were not overweighted in the stocks controlled or favoured by those same institutions. No doubt over time a sophisticated market will emerge in which investors will demand, and get, greater transparency, will pick and choose their funds and will closely monitor their performance. For the present the big institutions have it all their own way as they aggressively capture clients through their networks and channel the resulting funds into their broking units. What is not in doubt, however, is the potential impact of the domestic institutions as they flex their muscles in their own backyard. January and February, when the presence of foreign institutions in Spain was noticeable by its absence, provided a good indicator of what can happen when the home-side bulls are running. During those two months the volume traded on Madrid market increased by 122 per cent against January and February 1993. Domestic funds invested an estimated Pta193bn in the Bolsa during January, a huge sum considering that the average daily volume during the 20 trading days that month was Pta42.2bn. Two trends in Spain's fund industry have become evident in the past month. First, it has grown rapidly thanks to tax incentives and to strong marketing by the banking networks and also because recessionary periods spur the public to save in instruments that will earn them most. Secondly, the accelerated drop in interest rates have undermined the traditional attraction in Spain exerted by fixed-interest investment in general and government paper in particular. Spanish fund managers, always extremely cautious about equities, have begun to look at the Bolsa with an unprecedented enthusiasm. During 1993 the total volume of mutual funds under management in Spain grew from Pta6,627bn to Pta10,709bn, a rate of expansion that equalled the accumulated growth of domestic funds in the previous two years. Just as important as the growth was the changing investment trend. The CNMV, the Bolsa's regulatory commission, estimates that in the course of last year the percentage of total funds invested in equities rose from little more than 3 per cent to more than 5 per cent. This year the pattern is one of more of the same; larger funds and proportionally increased investment on the Bolsa. The funds topped Pta12.00bn at the end of May and are forecast to total some Pta14,500bn at year's end. The CNMV estimates that by the end of this year the percentage of funds under management invested in equities could double last year's figure to represent between 8 per cent and 10 per cent. Ahorro Corporacion Financiera, the broking arm of a group of savings banks, believes the year-end percentage on the Bolsa will be closer to 7 per cent. There are two lessons that non-resident watchers of the Madrid market should learn. One is that the Bolsa, for all its volatility, looks to be a more mature stock exchange with a sounder liquidity than at any stage in the past. The other is that for the first time there is the makings of a serious volume of Spanish funds that can be tapped by outsiders. The CNMV revealed in its annual report this year that domestic funds had increased the weighting of foreign equities and foreign fixed income in their investment portfolios during 1993 from 2.2 per cent to 5.7 per cent.</p>

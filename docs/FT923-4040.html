			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / Dumping of arms at sea comes under fire THE MINISTRY of Defence has not notified international regulators that it has dumped bombs, shells and hand grenades at a site in the Atlantic, it emerged yesterday, prompting allegations that the government was in breach of international conventions. The disclosure comes as concern is growing about the environmental costs of decommissioning military equipment as defence forces are reduced. The London Dumping Convention, to which the UK is a signatory, allows military dumping under 'sovereign immunity' clauses. But Greenpeace, the environmental group, said in a report yesterday that the MoD had an obligation to notify the LDC's secretariat of military dumping. Mr Chris Smith, Labour's environment spokesman, said yesterday the government had 'a clear duty of information'. The amount of ammunition dumped at the Atlantic site, 400 miles west of Land's End, will be 8,405 tonnes this year. It was 1,093 tonnes last year. From the end of this year, when the Oslo Convention on sea dumping comes into force, the MOD will bury old ammunition in pits.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The major issues and points of argument to be  included in the economic declaration of the summit of leaders of  the advanced nations to be held for three days in Naples, Italy,  starting on 8 July were decided on on 19 June.    While the world economy is recovering at a faster tempo than  last year, maintaining economic growth and creating employment,  that is, "growth and employment," are expected to be the central  issues at the summit because of worsening unemployment. In  particular, the United States and other nations are expected to  strongly urge Japan to continue its tax cuts and to increase  public investment substantially in order to expand domestic  demand through fiscal measures. One of the focal points of the  leaders' discussions will be whether to include  country-by-country economic measures in the declaration.    With regard to aid to countries converting to a market  economy, the leaders are expected to reach agreement on aid to  Ukraine, which is in the midst of a serious economic depression.    A Japanese-U.S. summit is also expected to be held on 8 July  immediately before the Naples summit. The two leaders are  expected to confirm Japan's tax cuts beyond FY 1994, and recent  points of agreement at the Japanese-U.S. economic framework  talks to demonstrate the strong "cooperative relationship  between Japan and the United States."    Unemployment has become the top priority political issue,  especially for Europe. The total number of unemployed in the  OECD nations has reached 35 million. While the United States  strongly demands macropolicies to stimulate the economy,  including tax cuts and other fiscal measures, and a loose  monetary policy by lowering interest rates, to deal with  unemployment, Europe and Japan favor a structural reform of the  labor market by correcting the excessively high wage levels and  unemployment benefits.    The main issue for Germany is a looser monetary policy; for  other European countries, the structural reform of the labor  market; for Japan, expanding domestic demand; and for the United  States, reducing the fiscal deficits.    Following the agreement on aid to Russia at the Tokyo  summit,  the Naples summit will discuss plans to ask Ukraine, which is  where the Chernobyl nuclear power plant is located, to close the  power plant completely in exchange for economic assistance. A  survey team will be send to Ukraine, and aid measures will be  discussed based on the findings of the team.    In addition, the leaders will confirm the conversion of GATT  to the World Trade Organization (WTO) from January 1995, and  they will discuss problems relating to the world trade system.  They are also expected to include in the economic declaration  stronger measures to prevent money laundering, which will also  cover funds used for arms procurement, in order to deal with  regional conflicts, as well as regulations on bribery by the  advanced nations' companies in developing countries.</p>

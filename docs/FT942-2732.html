			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / International Company News: An unsentimental view of Hong Kong's future - Wheelock's Mr Woo has a clear view on the way the colony is to survive For a man whose personal wealth has fallen in value by almost USDollars 1bn this year, Mr Peter Woo, chairman of Wheelock, the large Hong-Kong based conglomerate, is remarkably confident. 'It's all paper stuff,' he says. 'You can't look at the share market and say: 'this is reality'. It's your businesses, it's your networking, it's your markets: these can't be simply reflected on any one day in terms of what the market perceives.' Mr Woo's insouciance in the face of a near 30 per cent fall in the Hong Kong stock market since the beginning of this year (and a 22.5 per cent fall in the price of shares in Wheelock) may be in part due to his ownership of almost 60 per cent of the company leaving him feeling impervious to hostile takeovers. But the language he uses to display his lack of concern underlines an attitude to business which Asian businessmen such as Mr Woo, moving between the Chinese and the Anglo-Saxon worlds, are beginning to exemplify. Sporting a Columbia University MBA, Mr Woo, 49, is as comfortable with the latest western management concepts and practices as he is with the observance of traditional Confucian values. He is a one of the handful of businessmen in Hong Kong whose commitment to the colony after its reversion to Chinese sovereignty in 1997 is crucial to its long-term success. His group, which has a combined market value of more than HKDollars 100bn (USDollars 12.9bn), not only owns some of the enduring symbols of Hong Kong - such as the Star Ferry, and the Peak Tram - but is a large developer of residential and commercial property and has sizeable interests in the colony's infrastructure and container port. Last month Wheelock made its a first step into the financial services industry by announcing a USDollars 100m joint venture with National Westminster Bank of the UK, to form Wheelock NatWest, a merchant bank. Two months earlier Wheelock teamed-up with Mr Richard Branson's Virgin group to bring Virgin's music stores to Hong Kong and China, swapping its control of retail shopping space for Virgin's flare in mass marketing music. Both the NatWest and Virgin tie-ups fit neatly into Mr Woo's strategy for Wheelock: that it should link up with foreign companies which have expertise or products it lacks. But both deals look small compared with the main challenge Mr Woo has set himself - to establish a substantial presence on the China mainland. Two years ago Mr Woo caught investors' attention when he sketched an idea of how to exploit the position of Wuhan, the capital of Hebei province situated on the Yangtze river. His idea was to build a big container port on the river, with road and rail links to Shanghai and Hong Kong, and industrial and commercial parks. Ever since the late 19th century Wuhan has been touted as the Chicago of China. Like much of China, then and now, the city was seen to have enormous potential. But Mr Woo is finding some difficulties with his vision. Although a number of feasibility studies have been finished, his grand design for Wuhan has progressed at a slower pace than he would have liked. 'They (China's central government) have resource limitations themselves. In terms of their own development plans they have their own priorities and developing Wuhan was not in their five-year plan,' he says. 'If there is no outside party from Hong Kong to kick-start these projects then they will take much longer to happen,' he says. 'Bureaucratic politics is extremely intense between cities and provinces, ministries, and across ministries. It's almost like if the idea is from another bureaucracy it must be a bad idea to start off with. So they're usually not very receptive to somebody else's idea, but if it's from the outside then at least you can get to talk about it.' Mr Woo says it is the quality of the proposal which determines success or failure. 'I think one should be clear that legitimate business is done whereby your deal and proposal stands on its own. I mean, you might have one or two small deals where people allow you to do things, but you cannot look at that as a way of business.' Any conversation with a Hong Kong tycoon invariably leads to the colony's future and the Sino-British row over its political development. While most of his peers shy away from comment, Mr Woo does not. His reaction to the row is practical and undramatic. 'There was an idea about how nice it would be to pass through 1997 without any changes. Well that's not going to happen, something seems to have gone wrong. Is this something we can live with, or is it something which suggests the sky is going to fall in? Well, evidence of the sky falling in is not very strong. We have a large engagement here and we must look ahead, we must look through this.' Mr Woo thinks Britain is wasting its time fighting with China so close to the change in sovereignty. 'I believe they (the Chinese) are sincere about civil rights, but they will not allow political rights whereby one political party can get 31 seats to control Hong Kong's legislature,' he says. The greater right for Hong Kong's 6m people is not elective democracy but the freedom to leave the colony when they want. 'Article 31 of the Basic Law (China's constitution for Hong Kong) says that everyone in Hong Kong has freedom of movement. That is a very important policy. If you take that clause away no matter if you have democracy here or not it will not work.' Mr Woo also has an unsentimental view of Hong Kong's future. For him there is only one way for colonial Hong Kong to survive. 'We have to make sure that we enhance our own value and we have to do it in a way that is not very threatening to anybody who works with us. It is the enhancement of our value that will put us in a good position to extend the lease for another 50 years.'</p>

			<p><P> November 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FREEDOM'S DOOR SHUT IN FACE OF SOVIET JEWS  </P> <P> Fifteen years ago, the United States told the Soviet Union that if Moscow hoped  to enjoy friendlier relations -- or significant trade -- with Washington, it  would have to allow many more Soviet Jews to emigrate to the country of their  choice. During the past year, Mikhail S. Gorbachev has essentially met or  exceeded this longstanding U.S. demand. Yet Washington began to restrict  severely the number of Soviet Jews it would admit -- and hardly anyone  complained.  </P> <P> The resulting situation is a paradox fraught with political irony and human  tragedy. It demonstrates Washington's inability to replace rhetoric with action  when an unexpected and unaccustomed foreign-policy success comes along. It  tests the mettle of the leaders of the mainstream American Jewish community,  which may not be as prepared to pick a fight with Washington or Jerusalem as it  was with Moscow. And it creates another source of tension between the United  States and Israel.  </P> <P> The primary losers, meanwhile, are the people whom American politicians claimed  they were trying to help -- Soviet Jews. Some are stranded "in transit" in the  potentially hostile environment of Austria. Since they have Israeli visas and  cannot get American ones, others may find themselves in West Bank settlements,  where they will be unwitting targets of the Palestinian intifada. Still more,  after weeks or months of standing in line, have no hope of even an interview  with a consular officer at the U.S. embassy in Moscow for at least another  year. While the State Department has proposed a large increase in the consular  staff, the added personnel probably couldn't make a significant dent in the  present backlog of 30,000 applications.  </P> <P> The origin of this sad predicament lies in an amendment to the 1974 U.S. trade  bill. Sponsored by the late Sen. Henry M. Jackson (D-Wash.) and Charles A.  Vanik, then a Democratic congressman from Ohio, the amendment offered the  Soviet Union "most favored nation" trade status if Moscow relaxed its  emigration policy. By doing so, Congress injected a new element of idealism  into U.S. policy toward the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> "Jackson-Vanik," before and after passage, enhanced the political reputations  and campaign treasuries of Republicans and Democrats who attacked the Soviet  leadership's callousness toward a long-suffering Jewish minority. Within the  American Jewish community, it spawned the new battle cry of "Free Soviet Jews"  and became the basis for fresh political action. Indeed, the "refusenik" -- a  Soviet Jew denied permission to emigrate to Israel or other countries --  emerged as a new international symbol of repression.  </P> <P> In practice, the Jackson-Vanik amendment worked well for a time. Leonid I.  Brezhnev, the late Soviet leader, was willing to swallow his irritation and  make concessions to gain trade advantages. In an extraordinary series of  negotiations concluded in October, 1974, the Ford Administration and the  Soviets, under pressure from Jackson and congressional allies, agreed that "no  unreasonable or unlawful impediments" would be placed in the way of persons  wanting to emigrate. Equally important, those who applied would not be punished  for trying to leave the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> As a result, Soviet Jewish emigration steadily rose. In 1979, 51,000 Jews -- an  all-time high -- were permitted to leave. More than half came to the United  States.  </P> <P> But during Brezhnev's last years and under the caretaker regimes that preceded  Gorbachev, the exodus diminished sharply. The record was especially bleak  during Ronald Reagan's first term as President.  </P> <P> Under Gorbachev, all this has changed. In 1986, his first full year in power,  only 1,900 people, 900 of them Jews, were allowed to emigrate; 641 came to  America. A year later, more than 8,000 Jews were permitted to leave, with  nearly 6,000 coming here. And in 1988, almost 19,000 left, 13,000 of whom ended  up in the United States.  </P> <P> This year, Soviet Jewish emigration is expected to reach 48,000. The number for  August alone -- 6,756 -- was the highest monthly total in more than 20 years.  </P> <P> Now the problem is at the American end of the pipeline.  </P> <P> There is general agreement that Soviet emigration reform has matched U.S.  expectations and probably won't backslide. Accordingly, a one-year trial waiver  of the Jackson-Vanik trade restrictions has broad support.  </P> <P> But in September, 1988, the State Department dropped its longstanding  presumption that Soviet Jewish emigres qualify as refugees. Those seeking  admission to the United States, it decreed, would be considered on a  case-by-case basis, following individual interviews. One result, according to  the Immigration and Naturalization Service, is that the latest Soviet  applicants have had more trouble demonstrating a "well-founded fear of  persecution," a prerequisite for being granted refugee status, because of  favorable changes in the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> Bush Administration policy has seemed contradictory. On one hand, it proposed  creation of a new category of "special immigrants" whose admission "is deemed  for foreign-policy reasons to be in the national interest." For the next five  years, 30,000 special visas would be offered annually, many presumably going to  Soviet emigres. On the other hand, the Administration quietly developed an  interagency plan to cut back on the number of Soviet Jews admitted as refugees;  those without relatives, for example, will be automatically excluded. (About  half the Soviet Jewish applicants are expected to fall in that category.)  </P> <P> Although officials have not been eager to discuss the plan, various  explanations can be found in certain State Department documents: that Soviet  Jewish refugees, who cost about $7,000 each to transport and resettle here,  have become too expensive; that Soviet spies may be among a new tide of  emigres, and that it would be better for more of the Soviet Jews to go to  Israel, perhaps on direct charter flights from Moscow.  </P> <P> In fact, the Bush Administration coordinator for refugee affairs, Jewel S.  Lafontant, told Congress in September that 5,000 Soviet Jews now stranded in  Austria and Italy could "always go to Israel or return to Russia. In these days  of glasnost, that's not an impossible thing." A day later, Lafontant said that  her remark had been "misunderstood." Undersecretary of State Lawrence S.  Eagleburger said it in no way suggested that Soviet Jews should go home. Yet,  the incident highlighted the disarray in Administration policy on Soviet Jews.)  </P> <P> A State Department report acknowledges that even if official anti-Semitism has  abated in the Soviet Union under Gorbachev, the country's 2 million Jews still  face severe discrimination. Extreme prejudice has also surfaced among members  of grass-roots nationalist organizations that have revived during glasnost. And  once potential emigres have announced their desire to leave the Soviet Union,  their lives there have been permanently disrupted.  </P> <P> All this has failed to stir much public outrage in this country. The House of  Representatives, to its credit, overwhelmingly passed a bill in July giving  Soviet Jews and evangelical Christians nearly automatic refugee status for a  year, but the Bush Administration opposes it. American Jewish organizations  have not repainted the "Free Soviet Jews" signs in front of synagogues to read  "Admit Soviet Jews."  </P> <P> There may always have been a degree of cynicism and political opportunism in  the official American policy toward Soviet Jewish emigration. Some will accuse  Soviet Jews of trying to jump ahead of other persecuted people who want to come  here. But does the United States not have an obligation to those people whose  freedom it has demanded for 15 years?  </P> <P> Perhaps the Soviets who took U.S. rhetoric seriously should have been warned  long ago that this nation of immigrants has a lot of practice shutting its door  on those it has encouraged to flee oppression elsewhere.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Jan. 28 (YONHAP) -- The government on Friday  announced a set of second-stage measures to discourage the  overheating of the stock exchange.    The steps came on heels of a steep rise of share prices to  the highest in four years.    The new measures feature expanding the volume of shares to  be  additionally supplied to the market by 3,200 billion won worth  of shares from the initially planned 7,000 billion won worth to  10,200 billion won.    Securities authorities announced the first-stage measures to  contain excessive stock price increase on last Jan. 17.    The government also decided to prepare very shortly steps to  have the stock market stabilization fund sell off those shares  it holds whose prices have risen recently and buy low-priced  issues instead.    The 3,200-billion-won increase in the volume of additional  supply of shares is set to be made through the listing of some  unlisted firms, selling of those shares held by institutional  investors, and the selling of government-held shares of those  public banks set to be privatized.    Depending on the effect these second-stage steps will have  on  the stock market, the government will, if it is deemed  necessary, allow banking institutions to increase their capital  beginning May this year.</p>

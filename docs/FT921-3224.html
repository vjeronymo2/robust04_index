			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Arts: Vocem - Purcell Room Vocem is a keen music-theatre ensemble, much concerned with electronics, educational work and 'community' projects. On Saturday they appeared on the South Bank with electronics for Vic Hoyland's new In Pursuit of a Dream, and with the Endymion Ensemble and a few props for Judith Weir's version of Scipio's Dream - billed as a little known 'opera' by 'the 14-year-old Mozart'. In fact Il sogno di Scipione was a 'serenata drammatica' commissioned for the inauguration of the new Archbishop of Salzburg in 1772, when Mozart was already 16, but never mind; it made an engaging start for the evening. It would have made a still better ending, as originally announced, for it is half the length of the Hoyland piece and palpably richer in music. He and his bright cast proved that this pretty jeu d'esprit can work with no visual tricks more modern than a dance hall mirror-ball. Miss Weir's alterations to Scipione are limited and precise. The original scenario was the lofty sort of 'morality' that was standard for celebrating accessions to high places, royal or ecclesiastical: noble Scipio is divinely wooed both by Fortuna and by Constanza, and with guidance from a noble ancestor chooses the right one (the latter, of course). In Weir's wry, pawky English text he becomes an impressionable City chap of the 1990s, but mutatis mutandis the dream-vision remains the same. The Weir orchestra is updated to match, not only by electric guitar and keyboards to back her string trio and four winds, but with a huge, dominating part for mock-celestial harp. In that role Hugh Webb was indomitable - it must be more taxing than Mozart's own Concerto for harp and flute - and his sure-fingered rhythm invaluable. Gwion Thomas sang 'Mr Scipio' in ringing style, and with cool comic flair: he is a performer of noteworthy potential. The pleading soprano goddesses were Frances Lynch and Josephine McNally, both of them alert and characterful, and Andrew Gallacher's bass 'Grandfather' wielded more gravitas than his casual pitch really earned. He was more exactly sonorous as Oberon in Hoyland's piece, which is a thin-blooded extract from A Midsummer Night's Dream (no Athenian court, no mechanicals) with cosy intermittent warbling by the surviving characters. Even if the music hadn't expressly cited 'I know a bank . . .' from Britten's Dream, it would recall Britten's sound-world for most music-lovers: white-note harmony with a few modal twists, soft whole-tone clashes between voices. Unlike Britten, Hoyland offers little more than that - and his score is further diluted by long spoken stretches: half unintelligible if you don't know the play well, irritatingly truncated and denuded of context if you do. Besides most of the singers already mentioned, Philip Creasy, Phillip Casperd and Teresa Shaw sang and declaimed to excellent purpose. The net effect of In Pursuit of a Dream was nonetheless dramatically slim, and musically too bland and inoffensive to stamp a character of its own upon the shrunken Shakespeare text.</p>

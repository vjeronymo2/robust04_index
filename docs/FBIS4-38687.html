			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow June 2 TASS -- Russia believes it is yet  premature to speak about sanctions against North Korea, but if  the latter decides to secede from the nuclear non-proliferation  regime Moscow will insist on a gradual approach to sanctions.    "If North Korea strives to secede from the Nuclear  Non-Proliferation Treaty, Russia will be forced to gradually  begin solving the problem: make a warning and then the world  community should adopt a decision on imposing sanctions on North  Korea", Russian President Boris Yeltsin told a press conference  on Thursday. He added, however, that it is premature to speak  about sanctions as no decision has been yet adopted on convening  an international conference on the nuclear problem of North  Korea.    Yeltsin also said that both the Russian and South Korean  leaderships are "greatly concerned about what is happenong in  the People's Democratic Republic of Korea (PDRK) taken into  consideration its direct closeness to the Russian eastern  borders".    "We cannot be indifferent to how the PDRK treats the earlier  signed Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and are ready to act",  Yeltsin said and admitted that the problem has been delayed for  too long and "has no positive solution so far".    The Russian president said that he may discuss the problem  with his US counterpart.    Speaking on the Soviet-North Korean friendship and  cooperation treaty of 1961, Yeltsin recalled that an amendment  had been introduced to its first article which envisaged an  immediate military help to Pyongyang if the latter was attacked.  Now "there is no strict provision envisaging that we help and  side with the PDRK", Yeltsin said.</p>

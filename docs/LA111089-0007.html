			<p><P> November 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARTHUR J. HOLLAND; FORMER MAYOR OF TRENTON, N.J.  </P> <P> Arthur J. Holland, mayor of Trenton, N.J. for nearly three decades and recent  president of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, died Thursday of cancer in a  Trenton hospital. He was 71.  </P> <P> Shortly after Holland ended his term as president of the conference in June,  the nationwide group gave him its highest honor, the Distinguished Public  Service Award. Previous recipients included Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey  and Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley.  </P> <P> Holland had announced last June that, because of inoperable lung and liver  cancer, he would not seek reelection but would remain in office as long as  physically possible. His term ends next June.  </P> <P> After beginning his public service career in Trenton's Department of Public  Affairs in 1951, Holland was first elected mayor in 1959, when the city still  had a commission form of government. He had served continuously since then,  except for four years after he failed to win reelection in 1966.  </P> <P> In his four years out of office, Holland served as adjunct research professor  in the Urban Studies Center at Rutgers University, acting city manager of  nearby Passaic, N.J., and consultant to the U.S. Department of Housing and  Urban Development, the Brookings Institution and the National Institute of  Public Affairs.  </P> <P> In 1984, the versatile mayor wrote a children's book, "The Adventures of Bernie  Bean," about a happy Mexican jumping bean who travels from Manhattan to Paris  and then winds up living in New Jersey.  </P> <P> A respected national spokesman for the urban poor, Holland enjoyed talking with  inner-city children. To demonstrate his commitment to civil rights, in 1964 the  mayor moved his family into a racially mixed neighborhood.  </P> <P> When President Bush took office last January, Holland optimistically sought $6  billion for U.S. cities through Urban Development Action Grants, law  enforcement assistance, money for the homeless, clean-water construction  grants, and funding for child care and youth education programs.  </P> <P> "To be a mayor," he explained of his wish list, "is to live in hope."  </P> <P> Holland was born Oct. 24, 1918, in Trenton and earned his bachelor's degree in  social studies and a master's degree in public administration from Rutgers.  </P> <P> A Roman Catholic, he spent six years at a seminary, but did not enter the  priesthood.  </P> <P> In 1962, during his first term as mayor, Holland married Elizabeth Anne  Jackson, who ran unsuccessfully for Congress last year against Rep. Christopher  H. Smith (R-N.J.).  </P> <P> He is survived by his wife and their three sons and two daughters.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with General-Major Manojlo Milovanovic, commander </F> of the General Staff of the Army of the Serbian Republic, by  Slavoljub Kacarevic; place and date not given: "NATO Will Not  Strike"]    [Excerpts] It is said of General-Major Manojlo  Milovanovic, commander of the General Staff of the Army of the  Serbian Republic, that he is the mastermind of this army. This  general, nicknamed "Mali [Little]" by his friends, caught our  attention when (in the first half of February) he started  negotiations in the name of the Serbian side and signed the  agreement on cease-fire around Sarajevo. [Passage omitted]    [Kacarevic] Mr. General, there is plenty of talk about air  strikes. The Serbian side is supposed to meet the conditions  set by NATO by 21 February. If these strike do materialize,  what consequences will this have for the Serbian Army?    [Milovanovic] [passage omitted] We are making it plain to  everybody that if air strikes do take place all foreigners on  the territory of the Serbian Republic will become hostages.  This also includes the representatives of the International Red  Cross, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees [UNHCR], and,  unfortunately, even journalists. Therefore, gentlemen, go ahead  and attack! This is one of our defense mechanisms.  Furthermore, as of 1 March, they have been flying in our sky  and recorded everything. They have probably also placed  numerous radio tracers [radio lokator] on the ground, along the  separating lines. However, their problem is that they know all  our capabilities [sentence as published]. Earlier they did not  know, for example, that we can follow them all over Europe, and  especially in Italy where they are concentrating. In one combat  raid, as we soldiers call it, we can decimate their first shock  group, which would consist of some 50 to 60 aircraft. Not a  single chief of state whose air force is taking part in the  attack would be able to justify this at home.    To become involved in such a war now would be a catastrophe,  however not for Bosnia, which has already met its fate anyway,  but for the entire world. Also, regardless of all their  technical equipment, they could, according to our estimates,  destroy 12 to 18 percent of our military hardware. This,  however, would not eliminate our advantage in military hardware  over the Muslims. The Muslims now live in 12 enclaves on the  territory of former Bosnia. They are all entirely within the  range of our arms. There are also UNPROFOR members in these  enclaves and they know very well that a sort of massacre of  international representatives would take place. We have no other  choice, we must defend ourselves. [passage omitted]</p>

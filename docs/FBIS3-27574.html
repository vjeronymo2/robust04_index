			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By China editor Cary Huang and political editor Mary Binks] </F>   [Text] A senior official from China's top advisory body  and once the most influential regional leaders has urged local  officials in Guangdong to keep a low profile in the Sino-British  row over Hong Kong--expected to reach a new pitch this week. Ye  Xuanping, the executive vice-chairman of the Chinese People's  Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC], urged local officials  in the southern province to keep out of the row for economic  reasons. He urged them to concentrate more on solidifying  economic exchange and cooperation with neighbouring Hong Kong,  according to Chinese sources.    The central government has taken a hard line against the  decision by Britain to unilaterally implement political reform  in Hong Kong. It has vowed to dismantle the territory's three  tiers of government in 1997 if the reforms proceed. The threat  has created apprehension in neighbouring Guangdong over possible  economic ramifications.    This will intensify today as Hong Kong's Executive Council  sanctions a decision by Governor Chris Patten to implement the  remainder of his constitutional reforms. Later this week,  Britain will also issue its account of the Sino-British  negotiations reinforcing an end to cooperation on political  reform. Tomorrow legislators are expected to pass the first  stage of the constitutional reform package, to be followed by  the gazetting of the remainder of the reforms on Friday [25  February].    By highlighting the importance of economic co-operation  between the two neighbouring regions in his recent meetings with  local officials, Mr Ye attempted to persuade local officials to  side-step the Sino-British controversy over constitutional  reform and airport financing. The former provincial governor  said close commercial relations between the two neighbours were  not only crucial for Guangdong's economic development but also  contributed significantly in easing the transition of  sovereignty from Britain to China in 1997.    Mr Ye was concerned that the ongoing Sino-British quarrel  would jeopardise economic ties between the two communities and  urged local leaders not to join the chorus to fuel the row. The  Sino-British dispute was a diplomatic affair between the  sovereign governments of Beijing and London, and relations  between Guangdong and Hong Kong was a commercial one between two  local communities, Mr Ye was quoted as telling officials.    Guangdong sources said Mr Ye was disappointed with some  local  officials' comments on the Sino-British row and was concerned  about its effect on the development of the local economy, which  was becoming intertwined with that of Hong Kong. Mr Ye was also  apparently trying to prevent local officials passing resolutions  or issuing public statements on the Sino-British dispute during  the ongoing provincial legislative session, one Guangzhou-based  analyst said.</p>

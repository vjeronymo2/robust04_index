			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Excerpts" of speech by Cheng Weigao, secretary of the </F> Hebei Provincial CPC Committee, delivered on 24 January after  concluding his investigation and study activities in  Qinhuangdao, Tangshan, and Cangzhou cities]    [Text] The major purpose of my current visits to the two  cities Tangshan and Qinhuangdao is to investigate and study two  issues. One is how we can accelerate the reform, opening up, and  economic development of the areas around Bohai Sea. The other  is how we can make cadres' work serve reform, opening up, and  economic development more vigorously and effectively. Based on  the investigation and study, I will speak on several opinions.    1. The reform, opening up, and economic construction of the  three cities of Qinhuangdao, Tangshan, and Cangzhou have made  marked headway and have been further accelerated since the  publication of the important speeches given by Comrade Xiaoping  during his south China inspection tour.    With the guidance of the guidelines of the 14th party  congress, leading bodies at all levels and the vast number of  cadres and the masses of the three cities of Qinhuangdao,  Tangshan, and Cangzhou have devoted plenty of painstaking  efforts to the reform, opening up, and economic development of  their own localities in the past few years and scored notable  achievements. They have attained a fairly rapid economic  development; substantially increased the input of fixed assets  to further enhance their strengthen for sustained development;  stabilized and improved agriculture and accelerated rural  economic development; gradually deepened the reform in various  fields focusing on establishing the modern enterprise system;  and opened wider to the outside world. They are high-spirited  and determined to attain still higher goals. All the work for  reform and construction is making headway in a healthy manner,  and the general development trend is good and encouraging.    However, judging from the expectations and demands of the  provincial government and the people throughout the province,  the positions of Qinhuangdao, Tangshan, and Cangzhou and the  role they should play, the advantages and tremendous potential  of these three cities, and a comparison with advanced coastal  localities, we should realistically and frankly admit that the  three cities have yet to achieve major breakthroughs in opening  to the outside world and in economic development. First, they  have yet to attain a big leap in economic development. Although  the annual GNP growth rates of the three cities were higher than  the provincial average in the past few years, not many of the  overall indicators were higher than the provincial average, and  some of them were even lower than the provincial average, making  their gap from other advanced coastal open cities of the country  still wider. Second, they have yet to make a bigger stride in  both the range and quality of opening to the outside world.  Among the first group of 14 coastal cities designated by the  country to open to the outside world, Qinhuangdao ranks among  the four at the bottom in terms of major economic indicators,  effecting little change as compared with the early period for  opening to the outside world. As Hebei's only national-level  development zone, the Qinhuangdao Economic and Technological  Development Zone has planned many projects, but few of them are  enterprises that produce high- and new-tech products and that  conduct business as conglomerates. Tangshan and Cangzhou are  still in the initial stage in opening to the outside world.  Third, some important measures for taking advantage of the  position around Bohai Sea to achieve substantial development are  still being prepared or in the initial stage. Major  breakthroughs have yet to be made in seizing the opportunity and  developing the advantages to develop large-scale association and  cooperation with other provinces, municipalities, and regions,  and to strengthen economic, technological, and trade exchanges  with the various Northeast Asian countries. Fourth, many old  enterprises have made slow progress in introducing funds from  abroad to carry out technical transformation, in transforming  their mechanisms and systems, and in achieving technological  advance. Some large and medium-sized enterprises are half-dead,  and some of the enterprises and products which used to rank  "first" in the country have lost their "first" positions and are  faced with the danger to be pushed behind. Fifth, some major  work that should be made successful is not satisfactory. Among  the 100 key projects of the three cities to be developed in the  Eighth Five-Year Plan period, 26 are still lacking the  conditions for starting construction or have not been planned;  and some which have started also have many problems that require  urgent solutions.    Correct understanding of our own deficiencies and  shortcomings constitutes the prerequisite for continued  advancement. Comrades of Qinhuangdao, Tangshan, and Cangzhou  should not only fully affirm their already scored achievements  but also fully understand their own deficiencies and  shortcomings as well as their existing difficulties. Only by  doing so can they set forth even more definite and feasible  goals to be attained and can they do their work more  realistically and purposefully.    In this new year, the fundamental principle for our work is:  Under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics, by comprehensively  implementing the guidelines of the 14th CPC Congress and the  third plenary session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, we  should accelerate the establishment of the socialist market  economic structure, maintain the sustained, rapid, and sound  development of the national economy, safeguard political  stability, and promote the all-round progress of society. We  should conscientiously carry out this fundamental principle and  resolutely subject and orient ourselves to the overall situation  of the whole party work, that is to "seize the opportunity,  deepen reform, expand opening up, promote development, and  safeguard stability," in order to push forward reform, opening  up, and economic construction in an even better way.    2. Qinhuangdao, Tangshan, and Cangzhou cities have  conditions  and are able to effect an even faster and even better  development.    Qinhuangdao, Tangshan, and Cangzhou cities are in an  important position and play an important role in Hebei Province.  These three cities account for 18.7 percent of the province's  total in terms of territory and 24.5 percent in terms of  population. All of the 487 km of coastlines of the province are  within these three cities. As early as ten years ago,  Qinhuangdao city was approved by the state as one of the 14  coastal open cities of China, and a state-level economic and  technological development zone was established. And six years  ago, 12 counties in Qinhuangdao, Tangshan, and Cangzhou cities  were included in the coastal economic and technological zone.  The practice from the decade of reform and opening up shows that  Hebei's pace of reform, opening up, and economic construction  should be accelerated further, and Qinhuangdao, Tangshan, and  Cangzhou cities should develop before others to serve as a  window to promote the reform, opening up, and economic  development of the whole province.    When viewed from the practical situation, Qinhuangdao,  Tangshan, and Cangzhou cities are completely provide with the  condition for effecting an even faster and better development.  First, these cities have geological advantages and are located  in important position of strategic importance. Second, these  cities are faced with the development opportunity that is hard  to come by. To implement the guidelines of the 14th CPC  Congress and to accelerate the opening up and development of the  Around Bohai Sea Area, the CPC Central Committee and the State  Council have already done a series of work. Recently, the State  Council has again held a seminar on economic planning for the  Around Bohai Sea Area in Tangshan city to further research and  define ideas, goals, and major measures to be adopted for  accelerating the opening up and development of this area. Along  with the gradual implementation of many major policy decisions  of the state, the opening up and development of the Around Bohai  Sea Area will certainly be accelerated. Third, natural  resources are rich and economic foundation is solid in these  three cities. Qinhuangdao, Tangshan, and Cangzhou cities are  extremely rich in land, mineral, agricultural, marine, and labor  resources. These three cities account for more than 30 percent  of the province's total in the number of industrial enterprises  exercising independent accounting and in the original value of  fixed assets. Large and medium-sized enterprises in these three  cities also account for one third of the province's total, thus  having considerably great industrial advantages. A large number  of on- going key projects will be completed and commissioned one  after another to display their efficiency. The comprehensive  economic strength and the momentum for further development will  be enhanced obviously. Fourth, the pattern of opening to all  directions of the world has taken shape. Over the past several  years, these three cities have all brought in many funds,  technologies, and professional persons and have initiated a  group of foreign-funded enterprises of three types, that are  relatively good in product and efficiency. The projects at the  beginning district of the Qinhuangdao City Economic and  Technological Development Zone has already been arranged to the  full, and the projects covered by the second stage of  construction are about to begin. Beidaihe, Beijing-Tangshan  Harbor, and Huanghua City economic and technological development  areas and a number of other development areas of various  categories tend to promise a good future. These areas will  certainly play a guiding role in further accelerating opening  up. Fifth, infrastructure facilities, such as energy,  communications, and telecommunications, have been strengthened,  the investment environment has been further improved, and the  ability of the three cities of Qinhuangdao, Tangshan, and  Cangzhou to participate in the division of labor, coordination,  and competition among various coastal cities around Bohai Sea  will be greatly enhanced. Sixth, through the practice and tests  of more than 10 years of reform and opening up, leading bodies  at all levels of these three cities have unceasingly  strengthened their ability to organize and develop the socialist  market economy and enriched their experience every day. A batch  of men of action who have upheld the party's basic line, reform,  and opening up, have strong pioneering spirit, and are capable  of undertaking major affairs have come to the fore. Seventh, a  number of good examples on actively blazing new trials and  seeking rapid development have emerged in these three cities.  For instance, the rapid economic development in Fengnan County,  the jumping economic development in Banbidian Village, the  large-scale development of Haomen group, the rate of building  the medium plate plant with the joint efforts of Qinhuangdao and  Shoudu Iron and Steel Company, the pioneering spirit of  technical workers of Qinhuangdao vehicle door manufacturing  plant in creating first-grade products, and the efforts and  determination of Haixing County to create favorable conditions  and to end backwardness are all very encouraging and inspiring,  and each of which has its own characteristics and played a  pioneering and exemplary role.    With the needs of the objective situation and all essential  conditions, the three cities of Qinhuangdao, Tangshan, and  Cangzhou have no reason not to take the lead in development in  the province. Therefore, the provincial party committee and the  provincial government have called on these three cities to seize  the opportunity during the last seven years of the 1990's, use  export- oriented economy to bring along the whole economy,  combine the efforts of places around Bohai Sea, Beijing, and  Tianjin, proceed from establishing cooperation at home, and make  breakthroughs in introducing foreign capital, rely on the  existing economic foundation and natural resources advantages,  develop places around Bohai Sea, Beijing, and Tianjin in an  in-depth and down-to-earth manner, develop cooperation and  coordination with Beijing and Tianjin and with advanced regions  in China so as to bring along opening up and development,  accurately aim at Northeast Asia and other countries, work  purposefully, strive to make breakthroughs in selecting major  clients for major development and cooperative projects, strive  to make the major economic targets and the comprehensive  strength of these cities enter a higher grade and move one place  forward in places around Bohai Sea and coastal cities by the  end of this century and to become one of the places in the  province comprehensively linking with the international economic  track, operating in line with market mechanism, and with a high  degree of opening up, good market cultivation, rapid development  rate, strong economic strength, prosperous life, and good  spiritual civilization, and lay a good foundation for making  these three cities take the lead in realizing modernization  during the early period of next century.    3. To achieve a more rapid and better development, we must  further emancipate the mind.    We must persist in meeting high standards in emancipating  the  mind. We should make the emancipating of mind meet the standard  of strengthening reform, expanding opening up, and accelerating  development and further renew our ideology and concepts to  promote a rapid development in reform and opening up and to  realize our set objectives. Comrade Xiaoping believed that  poverty is not socialism and slow development is also not  socialism, and that this is determined by the essence of  socialism. To realistically show that socialism is better than  capitalism, we must accelerate development. Otherwise, we cannot  display the superiority of socialism if it always lags far  behind capitalism, and the masses of people will not be  satisfied with this. He also said: As long as the project  yields economic efficiency and is export-oriented, we must not  prevent people from doing it if they can do it more rapidly.  With all the given objective conditions for accelerating  development, these three cities should seize the opportunity  actively, and take the lead in development and making  breakthroughs.    Of course, stressing this never means that we can daydream  in defiance of the objective reality, never means that we can  blindly pursue high economic growth rates and define still  higher targets. As early as 1985, Comrade Xiaoping emphasized  that the development rate should withstand the test. In my  understanding, withstanding the test means that the development  rate should be based on reality and should stress efficiency.  We must strive to avoid a high growth rate that is divorced  from reality and brings no efficiency because it not only brings  negative influence on the economic environment but also  increases the pressure on reform and social stability. In  carrying out economic work, we should both work according to our  capacity and exert utmost efforts; and both refrain from  pursuing merely high growth rates and strive for necessary and  possible rapid development. Only this means unity between mind  emancipation and truth-seeking.    To emancipate the mind, we should bear reality in mind. As  far as Hebei is concerned, it should particularly address the  following four problems. First is the slow reaction and a  feeling of uncertainty toward the series of changes resulting  from the development of the market economy and the series of  reforms put forward by the party Central Committee and State  Council based on the requirements of the market economy system  and the lack of initiative in adapting oneself to them; or the  fears of various kinds, helplessness, and passive attitude  toward them. Second is a lack of dialectical understanding of  the current opportunity for development, the failure to free  oneself from the outdated concepts and ideas and "leftist" views  that have taken shape under the planned economy system, and the  practice of acknowledging the rare opportunity theoretically but  attempting nothing in view of the numerous difficulties of one's  own locality and unit. Third is the practice of paying lip  service to the call for building an economically strong province  but following the old road when organizing and arranging  specific work and lacking the courage to achieve breakthroughs  based on the advantages and conditions of a locality. Fourth is  mechanically copying of the central line, principles, and  policies, the lack of in-depth investigation and study, the lack  of ability to work in a creative manner in line with one's  actual conditions, and the failure to blaze a development road  compatible with one's characteristics. Comrades at all levels  and of all departments should bear reality in mind,  conscientiously make analysis of the specific reflections of  these problems in their thinking and work, and conscientiously  solve the problems one by one in the practice of reform and  opening up. By solving these problems, we should further  enhance the awareness of reform, take the initiative in adapting  ourselves to the changes resulting from the development of the  market economy and the various reform measures put forward by  the central authorities, and seize the current favorable  opportunity for reform to accelerate our own reform and  development. We should further enhance the awareness of  opportunity, be determined to overcome all difficulties, and  truly seize and use well the favorable opportunity for  accelerating development. We should enhance the awareness of  "breakthrough" and make the best of our favorable conditions to  achieve faster development in economic construction. We should  enhance the awareness of innovation, study the new ideas for  development, and strive to successfully blaze our own road of  development.    In emancipating the mind, leading bodies and leading cadres  should take the lead. Party committees, governments, and  leading cadres at all levels, especially city, prefectural, and  county party secretaries, mayors, and county heads, should  regard themselves as the first to emancipate the mind and  address well the problems in their thinking and concepts.    4. We should adopt every means to organize, discover, and  develop new growing points of the economy and increase total  supply and total demand and the per capita share.    Accelerated reform and opening up and faster economic  development should ultimately be reflected in the increase of  the total supply and total demand and the increase of per capita  GNP and per capita income. For this reason, Qinhuangdao,  Tangshan, and Cangzhou cities should implement "one strategy,"  build well the "two projects," strengthen the "three  foundations," develop the "five major industries," and  facilitate the growth of the "six economic factors." The "one  strategy" means the strategy of promotion through the  export-oriented economy. Guided by the world market, the cities  should pay attention to and promote foreign capital, foreign  trade, and foreign economic relations simultaneously. The "two  projects" are the Shenmu-Huanghua Railway and Jingtang Harbor  construction projects. Strengthening the "three foundations"  means to strengthen the position of agriculture as the  foundation, to achieve success in building infrastructural  facilities (including railways, highways, harbors, airports, and  telecommunications facilities), and to accelerate the  development of basic industries (energy and power industries).  The "five major industries" are the metallurgical, building  materials, chemical, machinery and electronic, and light and  textile industries. Facilitating the growth of the "six  economic factors" means 1) to further increase the input of  fixed assets and strive to develop a number of key capital  construction projects and technical transformation projects of  which the investment exceeds the stipulated norms and which  conform to the state's industrial policy, produce readily  marketable products, and yield good economic efficiency, 2) to  transform the enterprise operating mechanism more rapidly,  establish a modern enterprise system, invigorate enterprises,  and expand the scale and improve the quality and level of  state-own enterprises, especially large and medium-sized ones,  through renovation with foreign capital and technical  transformation projects, 3) to bring in and use more foreign  capital, introduce more investment from abroad and expand  lateral economic ties at home, build and develop the various  categories of development zones with great efforts, give full  play to their role, establish a large number of three types of  foreign-funded enterprises and enterprises that have lateral  ties at home every year, and continuously develop foreign  economic relations and trade, 4) to do a better job in  restructuring the agricultural sector of the economy, continue  to ensure the growth in the production of basic farm products,  such as grain, cotton, and oil-bearing crops, and accelerate the  development of forestry and fruit production, vegetable  production, animal husbandry, and aquiculture; and to greatly  develop township enterprises, especially township industrial  enterprises, transfer large numbers of labor forces to township  industrial enterprises, and substantially increase GNP and  peasants' income, 5) to actively develop urban collective,  individual, and private economies, and 6) to further facilitate  the development of the tertiary industry and the development of  transportation, post and telecommunication, commercial and  catering service, and markets for consumer goods and essential  elements of production and, in particular, attach importance to  the development of a number of commodity and material markets  that have their own characteristics and are geared to the whole  country.    To ensure the sustained, rapid, and healthy economic  development of the three cities of Qinhuangdao, Tangshan, and  Cangzhou, we should handle well the relationship in five aspects  when organizing and arranging reform and development. First,  while attaching importance to the development of the secondary  and tertiary industries, we should never neglect or slacken  efforts in agriculture. Farming focusing on the production of  grain, cotton, and oil-bearing crops, forestry and fruit  production, aquiculture, and animal husbandry are both the  foundation for rural stability and the important prerequisites  for peasants to achieve a fairly comfortable life. Therefore,  while accelerating the development of the secondary and tertiary  industries, we must put agriculture in the first place and  greatly develop the high-yield, good-quality, and high-efficient  agriculture on the premise that the rural reform is deepened,  the material as well as scientific and technological input in  agriculture is increased, and grain and cotton production grows  steadily. Only when we have the steady growth of the primary  industry can we have a reliable guarantee for the faster  development of the secondary and tertiary industries.    Second, we should not only plan for the future but also  grasp the present well. Now, all of Qinhuangdao, Tangshan, and  Cangzhou cities have their own long-term key development  projects. These key development projects not only have a bearing  on the interests of these three cities but also have a bearing  on the overall situation of the reform, opening up, and economic  construction of the whole province. Therefore, not only these  three cities should regard the construction of these projects as  the most important task, the provincial party committee, the  provincial government, and various pertinent departments of the  province should also put these projects in a prominent position  and give great support to them. Realistically speaking,  however, these projects cannot truly play a major and promoting  role until 2000. At present, to accelerate development and make  the people better-off, we must primarily depend on down-to-earth  efforts, including the effort to use the influence of these  projects to vigorously expand international and domestic  markets, the effort to build a large number of foreign-invested  projects and key capital construction projects, the effort to  tap potential and renovate existing enterprises, large and  medium-sized state-owned projects in particular, the effort to  readjust agricultural structure, and the effort to develop  township and town enterprises. Third, we should not set the  enhancement of the levels and grades of products against the  development of the ordinary labor-intensive products and  industries. Spreading the strategy of promoting the entire  economy through export-oriented economy, developing new  high-technology industries, and developing the products with  high added value are the necessary choice to accelerate economic  development, improve economic quality, and enhance market  competitiveness and are always the orientation of our endeavor  of development. The more tight we grasp this work, the better;  and the greater results we achieve in this work, the better. It  must be noted, however, the shift of numerous rural labor forces  from farming to industry cannot be effectively resolved through  the development of the export-oriented economy, the formation of  the new and high technology industries, and the development of  the products with high added value. And, without the shift of  large number of peasants from farming to non-agricultural  industries, it is impossible to make peasants become better-off.  Therefore, we should not only engage in fund- and  technology-intensive industries and enterprises as more as  possible, but also try every possible means to develop some  labor-intensive industries and enterprises in order to make even  more rural laborers shift from farming to industry. Fourth, we  should pay attention to not only investment but also reform.  Qinhuangdao, Tangshan, and Cangzhou as well as the province as  a whole have the long-standing problem of insufficient  investment. Although such a situation has changed somewhat over  the past several years, the change is not nearly enough if  compared with advanced provinces. We should continue to  strengthen the work in this aspect and try our best to ensure a  sufficient investment to promote economic development. However,  we cannot merely depend on investment to promote development.  We must primarily depend on reform. Changing the  administrative function of the government, changing the  operational mechanism of enterprises, establishing modern  enterprise system, strengthening the internal management of  enterprises, increasing the vitality of enterprises,  implementing all preferential policies of the party towards  rural areas, and popularizing on a large scale the shareholding  cooperative system among township and town enterprises are the  essential ways to emancipate and develop productive forces and  are the fundamental measures to tap the potential of existing  assets and accelerating economic development. All these should  be grasped firmly by party committees and governments at all  levels by listing them as an item on their daily agenda. Fifth,  in addition to actively promoting reform and development, we  must also strive to maintain social stability. We should  correctly handle the relations of reform, development, and  stability, and, in addition to maintaining a rapid and good  economic development, guarantee the implementation of all  central reform policies and measures, not hesitate or waver in  this work, and pay great attention to safeguarding social  stability. We should pay special attention to studying with  grert concentration all one-sided and incorrect understanding,  new contradictions, and problems, particularly the influence in  the immediate interests of the masses of people which may  possibly emerge in reforms. We should adopt purposeful measures  in a timely manner, strengthen propaganda and explanation,  properly handle all contradictions and friction, and create a  good social environment for smoothly carrying out reform.    5. The key to accelerating development is to install good  leading bodies and make a good choice and use of cadres.    During this investigation and study activity, we have given  priority to conducting an inspection to get an initial  understanding of the party and government leading bodies of the  cities and counties of Qinhuangdao, Tangshan, and Cangzhou  (city, prefecture). Generally, we notice the following three  points: First, most of the leading bodies and leading cadres  are good or fairly good, and a considerable number of cadres,  particularly the top party and government leaders, are in the  prime of life, full of vitality, and have skills and  achievements in their work. Second, places where reform,  opening up, and economic construction are good, have leading  bodies of higher quality, enjoy greater stability, and have  stronger fighting strength; on the contrary, problems of one  kind or another may exist in varying degrees. Third, a general  comparison of the county leading bodies and leading cadres of  these three cities shows that Tangshan city's leading bodies are  better and stronger in general.    However, if we set high demands on these cities, we notice  that the leading cadres of Qinhuangdao, Cangzhou, or Tangshan  all have problems of varying degrees which are in compatible  with the new situation and the new tasks. The main  manifestations are: They are easily content with their existing  achievements and present situation, and lack the spirit of  daring to surpass other localities and to create first-grade  achievements; some are willing to do something and to create  some achievements, but they fail to broaden their views and lack  resourcefulness and courage to plan their act and to seek  development; some have good work ideas and measures, but they  fear hardships, fail to stand the difficulties they encounter  and to cope with the changes in economic environment, and lack  an indomitable spirit; a small number of cadres are poor in  character and have unhealthy work style and poor work  performance; and a small number of leading bodies are knotty and  ununited, bringing unfavorable influence to their work. We  must pay full attention to these problems. On the one hand, we  must unceasingly attend to education and the ideology and work  style of leading bodies; and other the other hand, we must  establish a mechanism which combines incentive with restraints  for cadres as quickly as possible in an effort to accelerate and  improve the quality and ability of cadres in the course of  competition.    The fundamental purpose of establishing an effective  mechanism of incentive and restraints for cadres is to better  mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses of cadres and urge  them to do their work earnestly and wholeheartedly. Here, we  have a key issue which we must resolved first. That is, our  party committees and organizational departments at all levels  must judge cadres in line with party spirit and use cadres  according to their actual achievements. To uphold and enhance  party spirit, the most fundamental thing we should do is to  persist in taking Comrade Xiaoping's theory on building  socialism with Chinese characteristics as the guidance and to  comprehensively and correctly implement the party's basic line.  Specifically speaking, attention should be paid to the  following several points in implementing the party's basic line:  1) We should always act highly in unison with the CPC Central  Committee ideologically and politically, resolutely implement  various principles and policies of the party and country, and  ensure the smooth circulation of the party and government  orders. 2) We should uphold reform and opening up, proceed from  the principle of three advantages, as well as boldly pioneer the  road of advance and boldly think or act in doing what we have  fixed. 3) We should uphold the principle of development being  an essential criterion and exert all-out efforts to  wholeheartedly make contributions to developing the local  economy and to helping local people become better-off. 4) We  should uphold the party's democratic centralism, consciously  safeguard the solidarity and unification in the party and among  leading bodies. 5) We should set strict demands for ourselves,  perform official duties honestly, and tighten the ties with the  mass. All party-member cadres including leading cadres at all  levels, who have possessed conditions conforming with the  aforementioned points, should be regarded as being better in the  party spirit. Party committees and organizational departments  at all levels, which have truly been able to check their cadres  in line with these points should be basically regarded as being  insightful, impartial, and upright in appraisal. As for leading  cadres, we should not, of course, simply regard their party  spirit as being equal to their official achievements. Generally  speaking, personnel who have been strong in party spirit are  often able to score official achievements and the party spirit  of those who have scored prominent official achievements is also  often stronger. However, there are cases in which personnel who  are good in party spirit have not scored prominent official  achievements because they have shortcomings relating to ability  and educational levels. Therefore, while making personnel  arrangements for leading bodies and employing cadres, emphasis  should be placed on examining their achievements on the premise  of upholding the principle of party spirit. Only cadres who are  strong in the party spirit, capable, and able to score official  achievements, are needed by us. Thus, the official achievements  of leading cadres should embody the following six aspects put  forward by Secretary Cheng Weigao at the seventh plenum of the  fourth provincial party committee: 1) Conducting reform and  opening up. 2) Achieving economic development. 3)Performing  official duties honestly. 4) Maintaining the public security. 5)  Increasing the per capita income. 6) Enhancing the family  planning work. Of these aspects, the most important one is  economic development that includes the task of increasing per  capita income and the total supply and demand. The party's  fundamental task for the new historic period is to develop  productive forces. The key to implementing the party's basic  line lies in persistently regarding economic construction as a  center. The fundamental duty of leading cadres is to lead the  people to push reform and opening up forward and to accelerate  the economic development. If personnel who have worked in the  locality for three or five years and even longer are unable to  have the locality achieve great economic development, bring  about great changes to its outlook, and greatly improve its  people's lives, how can we regard them as being prominent in  their official achievements? There was an erroneous tendency in  some localities in employing cadres, in which the party spirit  was stressed without attention paid to official achievements and  perfection was demanded while stressing the party spirit. As a  result, a large number of cadres who are capable, had scored  official achievements, and had had some shortcomings, were not  promoted or employed for important posts. Hereafter, in  promoting and employing cadres, we should uphold and pay  attention to official achievements on the premise of strong  party spirit and good morality. We should protect or support  cadres whose official achievements have been openly acknowledged  by the most majority of people and the main parts of their  achievements have been good though they have one shortcoming or  another. We should promote them to important posts as long as  they deserve to be promoted. We should be determined to  readjust the posts occupied by cadres who have no or no  prominent official achievements though they have got along well  with the locality in other fields. Readjustment does not mean  that they should be handled but means to let them do the work  suitable to their capability.    In establishing the mechanisms for encouraging and  restricting cadres, the general demand is to institutionalize,  through the mechanisms, the appraisal, reward and punishment,  and use of leading cadres and to implement them conscientiously  so that there will be clear rewards to those who are diligent  and clear punishments to those who are lazy, leading cadres at  all levels will be encouraged to pioneer the way forward and vie  to be the best, and the targets and tasks of building an  economically strong province will be implemented at every level.  The provincial party committee tentatively considered to  establish the mechanisms first in the leading bodies and leading  cadres at the county (city, district) level. In establishing  the mechanisms, the following principles should be reflected and  mastered. 1) The principle of attaching importance to true  performance. Based on this principle, we should set both  qualitative and quantitative requirements in appraising cadres,  quantify as many requirements as possible, and make the targets  scientific and reasonable as much as possible so as to stimulate  the enthusiasm of cadres and make the systems more operable. 2)  The principle of treating different cases in different ways. As  the basic conditions are different for the work of coastal open  areas, the areas around Beijing and Tianjin, the areas along  railways and highways that enjoy good transport service,  ordinary plain areas, mountainous areas, and upland areas, the  targets and requirements in appraising them should also be  different. We should determine their categories and levels in a  reasonable manner and put forward targets and requirements  accordingly to avoid uniformity. 3) The principle of strict  appraisal. Cadres should be appraised at regular intervals  based on the stipulated targets and requirements, the  requirements should not be made higher or lower at will, and no  perfunctory work or accommodation is allowed. Appraisals should  be led by organization departments and participated in by  discipline inspection departments, auditing departments,  planning commissions, economic and trade, family planning,  public security, procuratorial, judicial, and other relevant  departments. We should also pay attention to the opinions of  various quarters and organize the masses to participate in the  appraisals at regular intervals or when necessary. 4) The  principle of selecting the superior and eliminating the  inferior. We should distinguish two situations. One is to see  whether the cadres are qualified to their leading posts. If  they fail to fulfill even the basic targets, we should consider  their reshuffle. The other is to see whether their performance  is remarkable. Those with remarkable performance should be  promoted on a priority basis or granted with proper political  rights or material rewards. 5) The principle of persistently  keeping promise. We should see to it that cadres are rewarded,  punished, put in important places, reshuffled, or dismissed as  required, and that no personal relations or the feelings of the  cadres concerned are considered. We may conduct study to see  whether these principles are correct or should be supplemented.  Specific matters related to this work should be carried out by  the organization department of the provincial party committee,  and specific methods for implementation should be formulated  after in-depth investigation and study.    6. We should work hard and in a down-to-earth manner to  ensure the attainment of the target of faster development.    Practice shows that in addition to the numerous objective  reasons, an important reason for some localities to fail to open  up a new prospect or successfully carry out some work for a long  period is some leading cadres' lack of the idea of painstaking  efforts and lack of painstaking work and painstaking work styles.    Judging from the situation of the entire province, we should  pay great attention to the way of thinking and work styles of a  small number of leading cadres. First are leaders who give only  vague, general directions, rest content with things as they are,  do not use their brains, and lack characteristics,  breakthroughs, and innovation in doing work, which is merely  mediocre. Second are leaders who exercise leadership by giving  principles. They are used to explaining major truth,  principles, and concepts but lack thorough analysis when  studying issues and lack penetrating judgment and  countermeasures when giving guidance to work. Third are leaders  who wait for instructions to exercise leadership. They wait for  instructions form higher levels in doing everything, do whatever  the higher-ups say, do not conduct investigation and study, lack  opinions of their own, consider a task finished after it is  explained, and lack the initiative in performing work and  solving problems. Fourth are leaders who pass the buck. They  shirk to others the responsibility for their own work and find  excuses and objective reasons and blame others for the failure  or problems in their work. Fifth are leaders who are weak. They  always try to be good men to ensure votes and lack the courage  to tackle difficulties, hold responsibility, face up to  contradictions, and solve knotty problems. Sixth are leaders  who exercise amateur leadership. When the situation changes,  instead of taking the initiative in learning new knowledge and  new skills, they carry out work according to their old  experiences, old propositions, and old methods and even feel  proud for this, considering themselves in the right. Seventh  are leaders who indulge themselves in formalism. They do work  for show, pursue "sensation," write articles and spin  experiences to praise themselves, and disregard realistic  results. Eighth are leaders who carry out routine work only.  They are busy attending welcome and farewell activities,  meetings, parties, and foundation-lay and ribbon-cutting  ceremonies, and reading speeches all day, waste much energy on  this, and miss the essentials of work. Ninth are leaders who do  work at random. To keep up appearances and satisfy the higher  levels, they give empty talk, tell lies, make false accounts and  false reports on achievements, and make promises they do not  have the intention to keep. Tenth are leaders who curry favor  with others. They are enthusiastic in establishing personal  ties, strive for fame and profits, and even openly ask for  official posts and powers. The above-mentioned cadres, although  small in number, have created very bad influence. They have not  only delayed plenty of work in some localities, lost many  opportunities, and impeded better and faster development in  reform, opening up, and economic construction but also damaged  the image of the party and government and arouse dissatisfaction  among the masses.    The nationwide general situation in deepened reform and  accelerated development has provided us a new opportunity for  development and many new conditions and new issues that need  urgent study and solution. Leading cadres at all levels must  pay great attention to and be determined to avoid and correct  the above- mentioned numerous unhealthy phenomena, step up  efforts to study and to train and improve themselves, and strive  to make their way of thinking and leadership more suitable to  the needs of the new situation. We should greatly advocate  throughout the province the work style of more study, more  thinking, and industrious work, the work style of painstaking  and down-to-earth work, the work style of carrying out work  vigorously and speedily through to the end, the work style of  courage to tackle difficulties, and the work style of plain  living, arduous struggle, and selfless devotion so that our  cadres will speedily suit their way of thinking and work to the  new situation and new conditions and will gain the initiative in  creating a new situation in reform, opening up, and development.    During the investigation and study activities, we, together  with the leaders of the three cities, listed the major work that  should be carried out in 1994 and 1995. Leaders of these three  cities must pay close attention to the work, carefully plan for  it, and carefully organize its implementation to ensure that the  work is completed on schedule. Based on the lists of work of  various localities, pertinent departments of the province should  actively render service and coordinate with each other to  support and help the various localities in fulfilling their  work. Leading cadres at all levels should have clear knowledge  of their responsibility, fully estimate the arduous tasks to  accelerate development and build an economically strong  province, and further enhance their confidence in attaining our  targets. In this way, we will have the good mindset and work  styles to promote our undertakings continuously and attain our  target of building an economically strong province at an early  date.</p>

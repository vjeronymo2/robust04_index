			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: General Motors The cloak and dagger intrigue surrounding Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua's move from General Motors to Volkswagen has certainly caused a head-on collision. But as yet his departure has not even scratched the paintwork of GM's financial performance. Despite the spluttering US economic recovery GM seems to be on target to break even on its North American operations this year. While unsatisfactory, that is at least a significant improvement on the Dollars 11bn-worth of losses in 1991 and 1992. General Motors has a long way to go - its vehicles, for example, still cost some Dollars 800 more each than Ford's to produce. Yet heavy cost-cutting seems to be having an effect and GM's gross margins rose by 1.9 percentage points in the first half of 1993. The company is also starting to rationalise the duplication in areas such as component design, so that engineers will have to select from a limited set of standard parts. Not all of the restructuring is negative. GM is putting the experience of its Japanese-style Saturn plant to work elsewhere in the group, and it is gaining market share as it produces more attractive models. In part, the company has been helped by the strength of the yen, which has made Japanese imports less attractive. That has given GM an extra breathing space it scarcely deserved. Whether the company and its workforce are really determined to capitalise on the opportunity may show more clearly in the negotiations for a three-year pay deal this autumn.</p>

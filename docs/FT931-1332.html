			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / Budget adds to depression over the North Sea: Rig manufacturers are braced for hard times THE THREAT by Amerada Hess to halve its North Sea oil exploration programme bodes ill for Britain's offshore oil and gas fabricators. Amerada, a leading North Sea exploration company, has threatened the cut if the government goes ahead with Budget proposals for changes in the petroleum revenue tax regime. Rig manufacturers have already seen a big drop in work since last autumn. Two thirds of the 18,000 workers employed six months ago in fabricators' yards have lost their jobs. One yard has been mothballed. Further rationalisation and closures are inevitable, says the industry, with capacity running well ahead of orders. The situation could be made even worse if oil producers reduce exploration fur-ther. Some fabricators may be forced to pull out of the market - even if the government decides not to favour coal at the expense of gas production in the energy white paper expected today. The industry believes that up to half the 12 yards operated by the seven largest fabricators - Amec Offshore, Highlands Fabricators, McDermott Scotland, Redpath, RGC, SLP and UIE Scotland - may be vulnerable. Mr Syd Fudge, chairman of the Offshore Manufacturers and Constructors Association, which represents the seven fabricators, fears that the few remaining opportunities for British companies to tender for North Sea work may be reduced even further as a result of the government's policies. Mr John Walmesley, finance director of Enterprise Oil, says the effect of Budget tax proposals would be to take away much of the incentive to re-invest earnings in new projects in the North Sea. Under the Budget proposals, extraction from existing fields will become more economic while operators will no longer be able to offset exploration costs against the profits from existing fields. The changes could not have come at a worse time for fabricators. A large drop in orders had been expected as the level of North Sea construction, which had been strongly in manufacturers' favour in the late 1980s and early 1990s, began to drop. Investment emphasis is likely to change - most of the large, more easily exploited oil and gas fields were discovered when oil prices were equivalent to Dollars 40 to Dollars 50 a barrel at today's prices. But yesterday's price was just Dollars 18.60 a barrel. Future fields are likely to be smaller, more complex and more costly to develop, say producers. The recession, and the fact that oil prices are not expected to rise substantially in real terms, will limit further spending. Investment, they say, is more likely to be in repair and maintenance rather than in the construction of large new rigs. Production facilities are likely to be smaller, with new units hooking up to existing, larger production platforms. That will mean less need for large assembly yards, many of which are in the former shipbuilding areas of north-east England and Scotland. Numbers employed in the yards since September have fallen from more than 18,000 to approaching 6,000. Turnover of Pounds 1.5bn last year is likely to fall to just Pounds 500m this year. McDermott, the US owner of the Ardersier yard near Inverness, and one of northern Scotland's biggest employers, has announced redundancy for most of its remaining 500 workers. The yard, which 18 months ago employed 3,500 people, has run out of orders. Closures and the shift in work to care and maintenance, as in the case of Ardersier, will damage local economies further. The three yards operated by Amec at Wallsend, Tyne and Wear, generated a turnover of Pounds 200m last year of which Amec estimates 80 per cent is spent in the local economy. This year turnover is likely to be nearer Pounds 100m - indicating a net loss to the community of about Pounds 80m. Companies are looking to overseas work to offset the decline in UK orders. In most cases this will involve selling management expertise rather than providing employment for British workers and suppliers of materials and components. The exception is for work for the Norwegian sector of the North Sea but competition is tough and tends to favour the home players.</p>

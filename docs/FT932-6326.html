			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / International Capital Markets: Milan SE in further moves to modernise THE MILAN stock exchange is set to lose its reputation for having one of the longest settlement periods in the world for orders with the introduction of a new timetable designed to cut settlement from six weeks to just three working days. The settlement plan is part of a broader campaign to modernise Italian equity trading and belatedly make Milan more competitive with other European bourses. It follows moves in the past two years to reform the stockbroking system and begin screen-based trading of some equities. The move to screen-based trading, which has been extended to include the shares of 39 companies, together with the inauguration of a clearing house for deals form the basis of the shift to speedier settlement. Under the new proposals drawn up by the Consob stock market and companies watchdog, settlement will take place on the third business day after a trade is made. Full details of how the system will work will be ready in September. The new practice is due to start on January 17 next year, after having been preceded by a lengthy training and testing phase, due to begin in the final quarter of this year. As previous deadlines for other bourse innovations have slipped badly, dealers may regard the latest timetable as indicative. However, Consob has made no secret of the importance of quicker settlement to improve efficiency and transparency on the stock exchange, indicating that the changes are bound to take place, even if a little behind schedule. Meanwhile, screen-based trading is due to make another leap in July, with the inclusion of shares in about 40 more companies. The expansion of the scheme will, in turn, lead to the inauguration of futures trading on Italian stocks, although that is considered to be still some way off.</p>

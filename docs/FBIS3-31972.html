			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Jorge Katin and Carlos Garcia] </F>   [Text] The National Directorate of the Sandinist National  Liberation Front [FSLN] and the Sandinist faction reached an  agreement on 24 January regarding the negotiating process of  constitutional reforms, a topic that had been triggering  disagreements between the two Sandinist sectors.    Yesterday, after concluding a special National Directorate  meeting, and which was attended by all of its members, the  Sandinist leadership agreed to consider the document approved on  18 November 1993 by the National Assembly as the "fundamental  political document" on the topic.    In addition, the UNO [National Opposition Union]-FSLN  agreement is for the FSLN, according to the agreements reached  by the National Directorate, the "basis to discuss the  constitutional reforms." The Sandinist National Directorate and  the faction added that documents or draft bills presented by the  other groups or factions must be recognized as legitimate  positions of the other parties.    The Sandinist leadership also decided that the FSLN  negotiating commission, which is made up of Daniel Ortega,  Sergio Ramirez, and Bayardo Arce, begins a round of meetings  with the representatives appointed by the deputies of the Group  of 13 (Social-democrats and conservatives) and with the  representatives of the Political Council of the four factions  "so as to strengthen the negotiating process of constitutional  reforms in political terms."    The Sandinist leadership also gave its political support to  the Sandinist faction when it agreed that it "should be the  sector to study and discuss the draft reform bill, which will  result from the consensus reached by all parties," and that the  "parliamentary negotiation ... will be conducted by the  Sandinist faction."    One of the directors of the Sandinist faction said that this  mechanism will allow the National Directorate's negotiating  commission to coordinate with the Sandinist faction, which will  discuss the draft reform bill with the other groups in  parliament that are not members of what we currently know as the  "Group of 13."    This position, which was unanimously adopted by the National  Directorate yesterday, seems to resolve a problem that  threatened to create a new crisis among some leading sectors of  the FSLN.    Last night, FSLN Secretary General Daniel Ortega confirmed  that the differences between the two sectors had been overcome  completely.    After concluding a meeting with Presidency Minister Antonio  Lacayo on the transportation strike, Ortega stated that: "All  differences between the faction and the National Directorate  regarding the topic have been overcome entirely."    According to Ortega, the decisions made yesterday by the  National Directorate will not affect the discussion of the  reforms, but they will rather "broaden other forces." Ortega  added that this does not imply disrespect for or disregard of  the agreements among factions.    He reiterated that the FSLN wants to meet with various  social  sectors to analyze the reforms and, particularly, that  Nicaraguans are given the opportunity to express their views  regarding the draft reform bill through open town councils.</p>

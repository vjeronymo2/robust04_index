			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Cross-party MPs urge code of workers' rights The government should publish a new code of workers' rights which should be included in employment contracts, a cross-party committee of MPs said yesterday. In a report on the future of trade unions the Commons employment committee split on party lines. But Labour and Tory members agreed that workers did not fully understand their rights and obligations. The committee said the government should reduce uncertainty by introducing a code of individual rights of workers and incorporating it into employment contracts. The report said: 'In simplifying the web of rights it would also be possible to extend rights of consultation from recognised trade unions to individual workers on a collective basis where these workers are not unionised.' The Conservative-dominated committee said unions faced a 'serious challenge' after a sharp fall in membership, and called on them to make more effort to attract members from the private sector or face becoming public sector-only bodies. The report said unions faced a challenge over how much they could still exercise their traditional core function of collective bargaining, but the committee was 'pleased to note the efforts of the Trades Union Congress and some of its member unions to reassess and extend the services which they provide and so retain and increase their membership. There is a clear need for trade unions to launch more recruitment campaigns explaining the benefits on offer in a modern context.' The committee urged the government to consult the TUC about matters 'within its province', and said unions should be asked to help shape the new modern apprenticeship schemes. Four Labour MPs who refused to sign the final document, said of the majority report: 'There is in fact much we can agree with, and we welcome the recognition that trade unions have an important role to play. This shows a distinct change from some years ago.' Mr John Monks, general secretary of the TUC, said: 'Today's report is a welcome break from the anti-union prejudices of the 1980s.' The committee spilt over whether employees should have a legal right to representation by a union, as they do elsewhere in Europe. Labour MPs said this was essential, but Tories said such matters should be left to voluntary agreement between management and employees. Another split was over Europe. The committee acknowledged that the future of Britain's unions might be strongly linked to developments in European public and social policy. However, the report merely said: 'The UK's attitude to such legislation will be crucial.' The Labour document said: 'We believe it is only a matter of time before Britain reverses its opt-out of European social policy. It is therefore inevitable that the pattern of British industrial relations - including its legal framework - will move increasingly towards a common European model.'</p>

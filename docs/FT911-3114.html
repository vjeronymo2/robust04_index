			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / Arts: Twelfth Night - Royal Shakespeare Theatre, Stratford-Upon-Avon The Royal Shakespeare Company's new production of Twelfth Night at Stratford is not very romantic, not very pretty and not particularly funny. It is, nevertheless, riveting to watch and contains one great redeeming grace: there is some regret shown at the end for the way Malvolio has been treated. The director, Griff Rhys Jones, must have made a fundamental decision at the start. That was to dress the court of Illyria in naval uniform. The decision reduces the romanticism at a stroke. People in uniform walk, behave and even listen to music in a more formal way than others: they do not fall uncontrollably head over heels in love. The result is that Terence Hillyer's Orsino has no great passion for Olivia: he is coolly detached throughout. On the other hand, the approach has its compensations. Since Orsino so rapidly changes his affections at the end, there is no reason to believe that he was much attached to Olivia in the first place. Also, with the naval uniforms comes a relatively austere setting. The colours are darkish: Laura Ashley in sombre mood. The restraint is reflected in the playing. This Sir Toby Belch (Bill Wallis) does not belch. Even he has been a naval officer in his time and sometimes wears the uniform to show it. In the late night drinking scene, he is in white tie and tails. The costumes in general are of the late Victorian, early Edwardian period that is currently fashionable in Shakespeare productions. Much of the comedy stems from the play as a whole rather than from individual characters, though there are some inspired moments. When the law intervenes in the duel scene, Sir Toby does a sword dance on the foils as if that is what he had been doing all along. Olivia (Jane Gurnett) wields a heavier sword than any of them. Ms Gurnett plays the part sensibly and without coquettishness: a woman who knows the right man when she sees him. That seems to me the best way of doing it. Where Olivia comes into her own is when she realises that her steward, Malvolio, has been maltreated. Her line 'He has been most notoriously abused' is said slowly and with feeling. Malvolio, played by Freddie Jones, leaves the stage with some dignity. His threat to be revenged on the whole pack of them is spoken more in sorrow than in anger, and there is some point to Orsino's statement that peace must be made with him. This avoids the cruelty of some productions where Malvolio is treated almost like Shylock. There is a gloriously flaxen-haired Sir Andrew Aguecheek from Tim McInnerny and I liked Linda Marlowe's Maria, very much a vivacious gentlewoman. Ken Wynne's Feste struck me as over-bitter, though this fits with his role in taunting Malvolio to the end. Altogether this is a more satisfactory production of Twelfth Night than the one currently showing at the London Playhouse by Sir Peter Hall because it is more of a piece. A lot of thought has gone into it; a lot of pleasure comes out of it.</p>

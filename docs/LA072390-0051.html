			<p><P> July 23, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER;  </P> <P> DRIVE-BY SHOOTINGS RAISE POLICE ALARM  </P> <P> Police on Sunday said they are alarmed by three apparently unrelated drive-by  shootings over the weekend in the city, which could indicate an increase in  gang activity.  </P> <P> No one was injured in the three incidents, which occurred Friday night,  Saturday night and early Sunday morning, but two vehicles were damaged by  gunfire, police said.  </P> <P> Two men were arrested.  </P> <P> Police Sgt. Tom Broderson said the three incidents occurred near what are  thought to be gang territories.  </P> <P> The two men who were arrested remain in Orange County Jail on $10,000 bail each  in connection with a 10:40 p.m. Friday incident in which four suspects in a  vehicle shot at a passing car on Janice Street.  </P> <P> Jose Coronado Mesa, 20, of Santa Ana and Pablo Aguilar Rivera, 18, of Garden  Grove were arrested on suspicion of shooting at an inhabited vehicle and  assault with a deadly weapon.  </P> <P> In the second incident, which occurred shortly before 11 p.m. Saturday, a man  narrowly escaped injury when four shots were fired into the windshield of his  pickup truck as he took cover under the dashboard.  </P> <P> Broderson said that shooting took place after three people in a car drove up to  a large group standing in front of a home on Homer Street and asked where they  were from.  </P> <P> When no one answered, one of the three pulled a gun from under the hood of the  car, firing it at the driver of a pickup truck.  </P> <P> Sunday's incident occurred at 3:40 a.m. on Starsia Street when a group of  people in a car drove by a home with a few people in the front yard, firing  several shots at a car parked in front of the house.

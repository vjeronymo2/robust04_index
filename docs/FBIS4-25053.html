			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 3 (AFP)--Tibetans seeking  independence for their country are becoming increasingly active,  and Chinese Communist Party cadres seem unable to stifle the  movement, Re Di, president of the autonomous region's people's  congress has told the Tibet Daily. In some regions an  increasing number of "reactionary tracts" have appeared, said  Re, who is also vice-secretary of the Tibetan communist party.  "Sorcerers and the superstitious (meaning religious leaders of  the independence movement) distort the facts, peddle rumours and  criticise our policy by trying to use international pressure,"  he told the paper, copies of which were available in Beijing  Friday [3 Jun].    He criticised some comrades for not realising the  seriousness  of the problems or the importance of their work. "Any  negligence risks harming the party," said Re in a speech he made  May 22, one week before demonstrations involving about 200  people erupted in the capital Lhasa, according to the Tibet  Information Network. Reactionary propaganda should be opposed  and separatists and common law criminals severely sanctioned, he  said. Re, implicitly acknowledging worsening social problems  which sparked demonstrations last year, urged cadres to pay more  attention to workers in debt-riddled state companies, the  retired, and the poor.    The authorities are clearly worried that anti-Chinese  feelings in Tibet will be aggravated by inflation and rising  unemployment. China annexed Tibet in 1959 after crushing an  independence uprising. Since 1987 the Tibetan separatist  movement, led by Buddhist monks and nuns, have stepped up  anti-Chinese action. Dozens of demonstrators have been killed  and hundreds arrested, according to international human rights  organisations.</p>

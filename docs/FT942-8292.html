			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / (CORRECTED) Survey of Greek Banking and Finance (2): Disposals put on hold as politics comes back - With the state-controlled banks slow to modernise, the private sector is making further gains in market share Correction (published 23rd May 1994) appended to this article. After a gap of several years, politics re-entered Greek banking when a socialist government returned to power last autumn, reviving doubts about the state-controlled banks' commitment to modernising. Greece's four state-owned banking groups, which control 62.2 per cent of loans and 73.6 per cent of deposits between them, acquired governors with close ties to the ruling Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok) but little recent experience of commercial banking in Greece's increasingly competitive environment. Reflecting socialist reservations about their conservative predecessors' privatisation programme, the state-owned banks' plans to dispose of equity participations, including sales of subsidiary banks, hotels and insurance companies - some of them at an advanced stage - have been placed on hold. The state-controlled development bank, ETVA, burdened both with equity participations in loss-making industrial enterprises and a high percentage of non-performing loans, has already received a Dr205bn capital injection from the government in the form of long-term bonds. The other state development bank, ETEVA, keen to expand into commercial banking, is negotiating with the government to acquire the Bank of Crete, which is still administered by a commissioner from the central bank more than five years after a Dollars 200m embezzlement scandal there was cleaned up, without losses to depositors. The private sector banks, which have invested heavily in information technology in the past few years and maintain lower staffing levels, now appear poised to make further inroads into the state banks' market share. Many routine operations at state-owned banks are carried out manually. Credit card operations and ATM networks are still underdeveloped by comparison with the private sector. The efficiency gap is demonstrated by figures for net profits per employee: National Bank, the largest state bank, recorded only Dr1.4m per employee in 1992, compared to Dr4.6m per employee for Credit Bank, the largest private bank. The state banks have also been hardest hit by last year's law which bans banks from accruing interest on loans left unserviced for more than 12 months. Non-performing loans are estimated to account for more than 14 per cent of National Bank's loan portfolio, while the figure for Ionian Bank reached 20 per cent. By comparison, the average for the eight private banks is less than 3 per cent. Yet despite higher provisions and shrinking margins resulting from increased competition, banks' profits grew steadily in 1993. One banker said: 'Spreads are still good, whatever anyone says, and even the state banks have been improving fee and commission-based income.' However, last year's earnings figures were increased by a requirement for banks to publish consolidated accounts for the first time. Conditions may be more difficult this year, with most banks expected to increase provisions as recession persists. Hopes for growth are pinned on the socialist government's decision to raise the consumer credit ceiling to Dr8m. Again, this offers greater opportunities for the private banks, which are more flexible in developing new products. If the new managers at the state banks have little to say about cost-cutting, they are well aware of the challenges ahead. Mr Panagiotis Poulis, chairman of Commercial Bank, says: 'We have a strong deposit base and a good branch network, but the range of variety of products, not to mention quality of services, leaves a lot to be desired.' Commercial Bank's plans for expansion suffered a setback last year when the bank was unable to raise more than Dr35bn of a projected Dr50bn rights issue. Nevertheless it is going ahead with plans to improve its ATM network and offer a range of new consumer-oriented products. It has also taken a bold decision - by Greek banking standards - in going ahead with the liquidation of Investment Bank, a loss-making subsidiary. Ionian Bank, Commercial Bank's subsidiary and main rival, is planning to strengthen its balance sheet through a Dr30bn rights issue later this year. Mr Panayotis Korliras, the bank's chairman, says: 'We have to expand our fee-based activities quickly to increase competitiveness.' Ionian has lost considerable ground to Credit Bank, growing steadily as several years of investment in technology and branch expansion start to bring results. Following a recent Dr30bn rights issue, Credit Bank is now the largest Greek bank in terms of market capitalisation. Its aim is to become a broad-based financial services group which can compete on western European terms. Like several of its rivals in the state sector, Credit Bank also sees opportunities for growth in the Balkans, where Greek companies already active in trade are starting to make long-term investments. Through its investment banking subsidiary, Alpha Finance, the bank is setting up a commercial bank in Bucharest, with equity participation from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Meanwhile, Commercial Bank is planning to take a 35 per cent stake in a new Romanian private bank, Co-operative Bank of Bucharest. Not to be outdone, Ionian Bank intends to set up a subsidiary bank in Bulgaria, with a group of Greek businessmen taking a minority stake. Attica Bank, a small state-owned bank, plans a similar venture in Albania with Greek companies already active there. The bank will use the branch network of the Albanian Savings Bank, which will also have an equity participation. The banks' Balkan ventures are intended to focus on trade finance, while gradually developing a local currency deposit base. Mr Korliras says: 'The capital outlay is not great and overheads are fairly low. Greece is a medium-technology banking country, so its banks can usefully bridge the gap between the existing Bulgarian system and European commercial banking.' But the Balkan ventures are suffering considerable delays - blamed on the absence of a regulatory framework for banking in all three countries and difficulties both in finding suitable staff and setting up adequate computer and communications links with Athens.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          GREECE'S BIGGEST BANKS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                             Assets          Deposits          Loans                       Dollars  Market   Dollars  Market  Dollars  Market                         bn     percent    bn     percent   bn    percent  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- National Bank   Bank of Greece       6,487    30.5     5,524    35.3    1,423    17.8 Agricultural   Bank of Greece       2,531    11.9     1,716    11.0    2,048    25.6 Commercial Bank        1,792     8.4     1,576    10.1      538     6.7 Credit Bank            1,054     4.9       931     6.0      351     4.4 Ionian Bank              893     4.2       696     4.5      276     3.5 TOTAL                 12,756    65.9    10,443    73.6    4,636    62.2 Greek Banking System  21,302   100.0    15,637   100.0    7,993   100.0  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Union of Greek banks  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- CORRECTION The figures for assets, deposits and loans held by Greece's biggest banks in 1992 in the above survey (May 20) should have been stated in drachmas and not dollars.</p>

"The main task is to prevent the emergence of red lines of  confrontation on the map of relations between Lithuania and  other states, including Russia. It is necessary to note that  Russia's fears connected with the singing by representatives of  Lithuania and NATO of an agreement within the context of the  Partnership for Peace programme are groundless. The more so  because Russia itself is taking an active part in the process of  NATO expansion and, probably, will join the all-European  security system," the minister said.</p>

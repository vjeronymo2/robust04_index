			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / Leading Article: Oil spill in the Shetlands THE WRECK of the Braer on the Shetlands is likely to become the worst pollution disaster the UK has ever experienced. It has already produced calls for tougher controls on ships in British waters. But it would be wrong for the UK to act precipitately, or even to adopt unilateral measures in an area which requires a high degree of international co-operation. Although wrecked oil tankers have often been in the headlines recently, the underlying trend in oil spills is downwards, and there is already a body of international law covering shipping standards and pollution liability. Nonetheless, the increasing stresses on the oil industry caused by weak oil prices and low profitability are rightly giving concern that shippers are cutting corners in order to strengthen their margins. What we need to know is whether this disaster was caused by culpable negligence, or whether it was an unfortunate combination of bad luck and bad weather. In either case, some form of regulatory response will be called for. An obvious model for the UK to follow would be the US, which passed tough new legislation in the form of the 1990 Oil Pollution Act in the wake of the Exxon Valdez disaster. This set the toughest standards yet in existence: it required ships to have double hulls for added strength, and imposed unlimited liability on them for the costs of cleaning up any pollution they caused. At best controversial But although this hastily enacted law has forced shipowners to take a close look at their operations, it is at best controversial, and at worst unworkable, judging by the widely held view in the legal profession that it will have to be returned to Congress for redrafting. In particular, the unlimited liability requirement has frightened off ship insurers, and encouraged large companies to put 'corporate veils' between themselves and their ships to insulate themselves from the liability. In acting unilaterally, the US has also complicated efforts to create common international regulations under the auspices of the International Maritime Organisation. Given that the Braer was a US-owned, Liberian-registered vessel with a Greek master and an Asian crew, travelling from Norway to Canada, the need for well-defined standards is obvious. It happens that Liberia has a good record both on ship safety and on incident inquiry, and there is no immediate reason to suspect that the Braer was sub-standard. IMO regulations will require all new ships built from next July to have double hulls, and all existing ships to be upgraded by 1995. There are also moves within the IMO to oblige shipowners to put safety on a par with profits in the management of their operations. Stricter policing The problem with the IMO, however, is that enforcement of its regulations is up to the signatory states - there is no international police force. If the Braer disaster leads to stricter policing, that would be welcome. A second weakness of the current approach is the emphasis on the responsibilities of the shipowner rather than the owner of the cargo. Under present IMO arrangements, a compensation fund financed by oil-importing countries (excluding the US) will pay up to Pounds 54m for environmental liabilities over and above the vessel's own insurance. This is shortly to be increased to Pounds 120m. The IMO believes, probably rightly, that this arrangement is preferable to unlimited liability since it provides a much stronger guarantee of a pay-out within a reasonable period of time. Any significant change in the existing arrangements would have to strike a careful balance between the requirements of safety and the environment, and the commercial need to ship oil. Braer may, after all, have shown no more than that ships can break down, and that bad weather can then hamper a clean-up.</p>

Just a  moment please. The minister is on his way. Here he comes.    [Nule] This is Guido Nule speaking.    [Alonso] Mr. Minister, we are contacting you from Havana.  This is Radio Rebelde from Havana. Minister, please, we have  here a press report that includes some remarks you made, that  Colombia will sell petroleum to Cuba, that this will be one of  the first trade agreements between the governments of Bogota and  Havana following the reestablishment of diplomatic relations in  October 1993. We would like to have a confirmation from you  about these remarks.    [Nule] Look, I can confirm the following for you: [words  indistinct] and I were in Cuba over the past weekend to talk  about the subject. We talked about that possibility and need  only to brush up the final details. But there is interest (?both  in Colombia and in Cuba) to conclude these negotiations.    [Alonso] And how will Cuba pay for it, Minister? What are  the  terms?    [Nule] Well, the idea is that Cuba will purchase the  Colombian petroleum under normal commercial conditions; that is,  at international prices; and Cuba will pay for it in hard  currency. But there is the possibility of giving [word  indistinct] for the payment.    [Alonso] When will these exports begin?    [Nule] Well, the idea is to begin exports as of July this  year.    [Alonso] How much petroleum will be sold to Cuba, Minister?    [Nule] Between 15,000 and 20,000 barrels a day.    [Alonso] Between 15,000 and 20,000 barrels a day. Very well.  We have thus confirmed this report. In conclusion, Minister, we  would also like to know whether it is in the interest of  Colombia to sell this petroleum to our country?    [Nule] Yes, of course. And this is what Cuba needs there.    [Alonso] Very well, thank you very much, Minister.    [Nule] Well, so long.    [Alonso] So long.</p>

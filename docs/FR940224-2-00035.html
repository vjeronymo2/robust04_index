The December 3 Certificate authorized DOMAC to install additional vaporization capacity and appurtenant facilities at DOMAC's liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal in Everett, Massachusetts. That Certificate, as clarified, required DOMAC to complete construction of the authorized facilities by March 18, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because of intervening developments and changes in DOMAC's original market projections, installation of the certificated facilities by the March 18, 1994, in-service date is no longer warranted by current market demand. Accordingly, given the substantial lead times needed to complete design and to obtain needed equipment, DOMAC requests that the December 3 Certificate be amended to remove the in-service date. In place of a specific in-service date, DOMAC requests that the certificate require DOMAC to file with the Commission by March 31, 1995, final design specifications and evidence that final equipment orders have been placed. Timing of completion of the certificated facilities will thus depend on the completion and delivery of the required equipment and will not require further intervention by the Commission to precisely tailor the certificate to the delivery dates for that equipment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment date:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> March 8, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 2.

WNG will sell the facilities to WGP-MCR at the net book value at the time of conveyance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment date:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> March 8, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 3.

Box 3288, Tulsa, Oklahoma 74101, filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;221&hyph;000 an application pursuant to section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act for a certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing WNG to replace approximately 20 feet of 20-inch transition pipeline and, upon replacement, to hydrotest and increase the maximum allowable operating pressure (MAOP) of the Blackwell, Oklahoma to Hesston, Kansas segment of WNG's system, all as more fully set forth in the application which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Specifically, WNG states that in order to increase the MAOP of the Blackwell to Hesston portion of its pipeline system approximately 20 feet of 20-inch pipeline, in five four-foot sections, must be replaced. WNG states that the pipe replacement and subsequent uprating will give WNG the capability to transport increased volumes of gas to the Wichita market center. WNG further states that the increased MAOP will also enhance service reliability and flexibility by increasing WNG's ability to shift demand volumes between the north and south portions of its pipeline system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> WNG states that the proposed replacement and uprating will cost approximately $222,000, which will be paid from funds on hand.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment date:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> March 8, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

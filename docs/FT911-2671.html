			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / UN plans crackdown on drug laundering: New narcotics chief sees attack on crime profits as crucial NEW routes and markets for drug traffickers have been created with the end of the Cold War and the opening of east European borders. The Soviet Union has reported large increases in addicts during the last three years and the United Nations says that some of the drugs now being smuggled through the Balkans are 'sticking' en route. The spread of the problem has added to the urgency with which the UN has started to merge its three drugs agencies to cut out duplication. The aim is to escalate and globalise its fight against the illicit drugs industry, which Mr Giorgio Giacomelli, new head of the UN's programme, says is worth up to Dollars 500bn a year. Mr Giacomelli said the UN would take the lead to co-ordinate a more rigorous worldwide fight against drug abuse. He sees a more vigorous attack on money laundering as crucial, to stop drugs money being channelled into legitimate businesses. Mr Giacomelli, a senior Italian diplomat who took up his post last month, will report progress to the UN Commission of Narcotic Drugs, which starts its annual 10-day meeting in Vienna today. The three agencies - the Division of Narcotic Drugs, the UN Fund for Drug Abuse Control, and the International Narcotics Control Board - are being merged into a single organisation called the UN International Drug Control Programme. The agencies employ about 150 people in Vienna and 50 in 15 offices around the world. They implement and monitor treaties on legal drug production and run intervention programmes to try to change the economic and cultural bases of Third World countries producing opium and coca leaves. Recent years have seen increasing emphasis on tackling the problem in the marketplace by reducing demand among drug abusers through educational, social, welfare and medical initiatives. However, Mr Giacomelli acknowledged that the UN agencies have been 'parallel institutions', not always in harmony, despite good work done. Mr Giacomelli said the UN's estimate of the size of the illegal drugs industry was between Dollars 300bn and Dollars 500bn. People tended to fix on the higher figure, which he thought was reasonable. 'It is second only to the arms trade and is bigger than the oil trade. With such amounts there is no limit to what you can achieve. You can buy or kill judges and you can set a very sophisticated underground pharmaceuticals industry,' he added. 'Against it, we have to operate within the framework of law or agreed strategies and tactics, while the crime world has no such constraints. They have no problems of sovereignty or borders.' Mr Giacomelli said organised crime had 'globalised as much as any other international industry.' This was why an attack on money laundering was at the heart of the struggle. 'This is where the international community is worried. It is a very significant amount of money and can influence the state of world finance. We have to go to the point where there is a linkage between the criminal origin of funds and the legitimate enterprise and then stop the criminal activity.' The three UN agencies have a combined annual budget of Dollars 80m. Mr Giacomelli believes that more will be available once he has proved to UN member states that the new single organisation is giving better value for money. Italy is the biggest contributor, because its agency for co- operation and development - which Mr Giacomelli set up in 1971 - recognised the importance of fighting drug problems early on. Britain, the US, Germany and Sweden are also among the UN's leading supporters.</p>

			<p><P> November 13, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VOTERS OK OF TERM LIMITS  </P> <P> I found Robert Presley's lament most entertaining. The passage of Proposition  140 does not necessarily indicate that the majority of the people of California  have lost faith in the professionalism of their legislators.  </P> <P> It just might, however, indicate that the people have come to believe their  legislators have been just a little too professional at the wrong things, i.e.,  collecting honorariums, soliciting bribes, selling votes and attending  fund-raisers while allowing "immense social and economic problems" to go  unsolved and even unaddressed. Frankly, the legislators of the California  Assembly and Senate have only themselves to thank for the passage of  Proposition 140.  </P> <P> DON J. KOLMAN, La Habra  </P></p>

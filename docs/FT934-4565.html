			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / DTI halts appeal on Polly Peck directors The Department of Trade and Industry has decided not to appeal against the decision by a High Court judge to reject continued attempts to disqualify four directors of Polly Peck International. The DTI had to decide this week whether to fight a ruling by Mr Justice Lindsay made at the start of November. He had decided not to extend the deadline for proceeding with the cases. The DTI had argued for the disqualification of Mr David Fawcus, former finance director, Mr Mark Ellis, joint managing director, and Mr Lawrence Tindale and Mr Ulf Siebel, non-executive directors. It argued that they had failed adequately to monitor, probe or institute changes to prevent funds movements to Polly Peck's near-east subsidiaries - or to resign in the absence of changes. But Mr Justice Lindsay called the DTI's case 'at best speculative and very weak' and said the directors had instituted changes. The DTI did not pursue disqualification of Mr Asil Nadir, the former chairman of Polly Peck, who fled bail conditions to northern Cyprus in May facing charges totalling Pounds 34m for theft and false accounting. Mr Nadir is bankrupt and his trustee has applied for a suspension on any automatic discharge on his bankruptcy order.</p>

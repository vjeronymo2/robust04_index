			<p>BFN     [Text] The main thing is to not forget our history, all  that is good and kind that was done and achieved in the past.  Under the red banners of the former Soviet Union great heroic  deeds were performed during the war. It is under these banners  that fascism was defeated, and it is under these banners that  Europe and the world were saved from the horror of fascism,  Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev stated. Today in  Murmansk he spoke at a 20,000- strong festive rally devoted to  the 49th anniversary of the Victory Day.</p>

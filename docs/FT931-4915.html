			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Letter: Shopping for a better relationship Sir, 'One-stop shops' make good sense and could provide a welcome simplification of the current plethora of government initiatives, if as David Grayson writes (Personal View, March 1), 'the opportunity of the century' is not wasted. Small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) do not need another signposting office giving directions to other government departments. They need one centre that can provide solid, reliable and practical advice about a range of business, financial and technological issues, as well as access to expertise both within government and the private sector. Modelling one-stop shops on the existing, effective citizens advice bureau network would provide a means of achieving this. Given that some banks also find this 'corporate advice bureau' idea attractive, the one-stop shops might then achieve even stronger long-term relationships between banks and SMEs.

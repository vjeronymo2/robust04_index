			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Food and Drink: High cheese - Country Fare AS YOU climb Puy Mary in the Cantal mountains of central France the air becomes clearer and the tinkle of cowbells in the distance sharper; finally, you reach the summit. Nearly 1,800 metres (6,000 ft) up, on the top of this extinct volcano is a view of awe-inspiring beauty. Nearby is Salers, one of the most picturesque towns in the area. My reason for wanting to visit this medieval relic was not the church or the 15th century lava houses. I was there for the cheese and biscuits. A very special cheese, it has to be said, that carries the appellation Salers Haute Montagne. Salers is made only in that particular area of the Auvergne from the milk of cows grazing at an altitude of 2,300 to 3,300 feet. It is to cheese what a premier cru claret is to wine. Aficionados reckon it tastes of mountain flowers - and they are right. But it is a complex flavour, tasting of milk and fruit, too. Made by hand in burons, shepherds' huts, the cheese takes months to reach its crusted best. If you contact the local tourist office in Salers they will be able to arrange visits to the burons - the Salers cheesemaking season is from May 1 to October 31. If you do not feel like motoring up the mountain - or worse, backpacking or cycling - you can visit the Marche aux Fromages in the rue du Buis in Aurillac. There you can learn the secrets of Cantal cheese production by looking at a reconstruction of a shepherd's hut and the traditional tools used to produce a real mountain cheese. More important, just about every Auvergne cheese you can think of is on sale in the marche. If you want Cantal, Saint-Nectaire, Fourme d'Ambert or Bleu d'Auvergne in perfect condition this is the place to go. They also ship cheeses. Oh - I nearly forgot the biscuits. Do not miss out on a packet - they are called Salers. Eaten straight from the oven these sweet rectangular wafers crumble delightfully in the mouth. Do not, as I did, keep them in a paper bag overnight, or they will taste like a soggy Weekend FT.</p>

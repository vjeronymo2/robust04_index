			<p><P> July 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GM FINANCING UNIT SLIPS; OTHER SUBSIDIARIES GAIN  </P> <P> Rising interest costs cut second-quarter earnings at General Motors Corp.'s  financing subsidiary, while the auto maker's two other major subsidiaries  reported increases for the period, the companies said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Sales of communications satellite services pushed earnings to new highs at GM  Hughes Electronics Corp. Demand for data-processing services by banks and other  customers boosted results at Electronic Data Systems Corp.  </P> <P> The parent company's earnings report was expected today.  </P> <P> The finance subsidiary, General Motors Acceptance Corp., said net income from  its financing, insurance and mortgage operations was $268.6 million for the  three months ended June 30, nearly a 20% drop from $333.9 million in the second  quarter of 1988.  </P> <P> GMAC said its financing and leasing business in the United States increased 27%  in volume from the earlier period, but interest costs soared. The company said  its average cost of borrowings worldwide was 9.53% for the quarter, up from  7.94% a year earlier.  </P> <P> GMAC had total assets of $102.8 billion June 30, up from $99.9 billion a year  earlier, spokesman John Andrews said.  </P> <P> GM Hughes Electronics said its telecommunications growth included sales of  satellite services to three operations: a joint venture of HBO and Turner  Broadcasting System; ESPN, the nation's largest cable network, and CBS.  </P> <P> Hughes also said continuing cost-reduction efforts at Hughes Aircraft Co. and  Delco Electronics contributed to the improvement.  </P> <P> The company reported second-quarter earnings of $240 million, up from $180  million in the second quarter of 1988.  </P> <P> The second-quarter earnings a year earlier were boosted by one-time gains from  stock sales.

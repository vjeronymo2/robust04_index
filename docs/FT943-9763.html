			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / International Company News: Thai animal feed group ahead Charoen Pokphand Feedmill (CPF), the listed agro-industrial arm of the multinational CP group of Thailand, yesterday announced a 39 per cent rise in first-half net profit to Bt684.5m (Dollars 27.3m) from Bt493.1m in the same period of 1993. Net profit in the second quarter, however, rose only 11 per cent to Bt375.8m from Bt337.5m. Further financial details have yet to be released. Prawn feed accounts for two-thirds of CPF's revenues, and the improved profits are partly attributable the continued strength of the Thai prawn farming industry. Thailand is the world's largest prawn exporter, and prices have been boosted by a fall in Chinese production caused by outbreaks of disease. Yesterday Trang Seafood Products, one of Thailand's listed seafood exporters, reported a 96 per cent rise in first-half net profit to Bt52.8m from Bt26.9m a year earlier. CPF's first-half profit increase is also a reflection of the company's relatively poor performance in early 1993, when chicken prices fell sharply. Poultry raising and feed account for a substantial share of business. Chicken prices have improved since then, although Thai poultry exports are still facing stiff competition from low-cost producers in China, Brazil and elsewhere. CPF has majority stakes in Bangkok Agro-Industrial Products and Charoen Pokphand Northeastern, as well as 5 per cent of TelecomAsia, which has a concession to install 2m telephone lines in Bangkok.</p>

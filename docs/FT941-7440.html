			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses ignore Wall Street, stay in high ground Bourses seemed to feel that they were due for a recovery after three Eurotrack 100 falls in succession, writes Our Markets Staff. Late yesterday, they were mostly uninclined to change direction when Wall Street wobbled intermittently lower, on renewed interest rate and inflation fears. FRANKFURT followed bund and Dax futures higher, although the market also said that it was waiting for inflation news tomorrow, a January M3 growth figure that could come in anywhere between 6 and 12 per cent, and more news on strikes from the IG Metall engineering workers' union. In the meantime, futures markets chose the more comforting interpretation of Tuesday's remarks on US interest rates by Mr Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman. The March bund future, said Ms Barbara Altmann at B Metzler in Frankfurt, recovered to around 98 from 97.24 on Monday, and the Dax future was 32.5 higher at 2,148.5. This took the Dax index up 20.05 to 2,127.67 on the session, and by another 12.58 to 2,140.25 in Ibis afternoon trading. Turnover eased from DM7.6bn to DM7.5bn. Financials, which had suffered from the bond market's weakness, recovered strongly: Allianz rose DM28 to DM2,628 on the session and DM27 more to DM2,655 after hours, and Deutsche Bank and Dresdner followed suit. Chemicals were strong, too, BASF finishing at DM297.50 after a session gain of DM4.80 to DM295.50; the sector, said Ms Altmann, was seen as an early beneficiary in the economic recovery cycle. AMSTERDAM resumed an upward course, although Unilever shed a further Fl 2.00 to Fl 219.50, bringing its losses on the week so far to 2.6 per cent, as investors continued to react to Tuesday's disappointing results and news that it was to restructure worldwide operations. The AEX index gained 3.58 to 425.81. Royal Dutch gained 60 cents to Fl 208.40 ahead of results which are due out today. Kleinwort Benson, in a note issued earlier this week, commented that while expecting results at the top end of market expectations, both Shell and Royal Dutch looked expensive 'as we believe that low dividend cover will mean pedestrian dividend growth for 1994 onwards'. Fokker firmed 40 cents to Fl 22.00 on reports that it had won a Fl 10m order to supply satellite components to British Aerospace. PARIS was supported by a stronger bond market, although turnover in quities drifted down to about FFr3.5bn as the CAC-40 index gained 25.27 or 1.1 per cent to 2,252.00. While there remains a glimmer of hope that the Bank of France may lower domestic interest rates today, most traders feel that room for manoeuvre has become even more restricted following comments by Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, earlier this week. Activity was generally muted yesterday, with Saint-Gobain rising FFr20 to FFr682 following news of its rights issue on Tuesday and BSN, the food group, adding FFr19 to FFr933 as it reported that a promotion campaign at the end of last year had been successful. MILAN failed to maintain its early upward momentum and the Comit index shed 2.44 to 669.72 as the market's correction reasserted itself. Olivetti put on L55 or 2.4 per cent to L2,359 after the news that its Omnitel consortium had joined forces with a former rival, Pronto Italia, to make a joint bid for Italy's second cellular phone licence. Ferruzzi shed L146 or 7.6 per cent to L1,785 after the Consob regulatory body said that creditor banks which took major stakes during the rights issue need not make a public buy offer for the group. BCI shed another L191 or 3.2 per cent to L5,738 after Tuesday's 4.7 per cent fall ahead of next week's privatisation: the sell-off price is expected to be well below current levels. Generali, which said that it had taken a 2 per cent stake in BCI, turned back after an early advance to L40,960 to finish L403 lower at L40,200. ZURICH bounced back after the hesitant mood earlier in the week and the SMI index added 44.7 or 1.5 per cent to 3,027.5, reassured by comments by Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, which came after the market closed on Tuesday. UBS picked up SFr25 to SFr1,472 ahead of results tomorrow: analysts are forecasting group net profit growth of 60 per cent or more, and a higher dividend. SMH registered shares put on another SFr8.50 to SFr216 in response to the co-operation with Mercedes Benz on the Swatchmobile city car project. MADRID dealers said that the country's own news - a 25-point cut in base rate - was already discounted, and the equity market lost some of its gains on the US weakness to close with the general index 3.23 higher at 342.85 in turnover of Pta33bn. Repsol rose Pta85 to Pta4,645 after an 11 per cent rise in net profits, but Tabacalera dropped Pta85 to Pta4,015 before after-hours news of a fall in parent company profits for 1993. BRUSSELS took its lead from other bourses as the Bel-20 index ended 7.12 higher at 1,511.47 in turnover of some BFr1.62bn.

			<p>In     a move that could have serious implications for the U.S.  aviation industry, Beijing has signaled that it is considering  using aircraft purchases to further reward France for its recent  pledge not to authorize arms sales to Taiwan.  In discussing  China's tentative plans to buy "more than 40 planes" from the  United States and Europe this year in a recent interview with  China Daily, Ye Yigan, president of the China Aviation Supplies  Corporation, seemed to make a special effort to imply that the  French-based European consortium Airbus Industrie may have an  edge in competing for those sales when he stated that  "normalization" of Sino-French ties will "help" China's business  with Airbus (3O January-5 February).  Pointing out that  competition among "foreign companies" for a share of China's  aviation market is "tough," Ye went on to suggest that China may  shift more business to the French-based firm, noting that "in the  future" Beijing will "further develop and improve" its relations  with Airbus.   Although it has been less than a month since China and France  announced the restoration of bilateral ties, Beijing has already  awarded a French firm a lucrative Guangzhou subway contract.  The  Chinese government had previously diverted business contracts  away from French firms to register its displeasure over the  French decision of November 1992 to sell Mirage jet fighters to  Taiwan.

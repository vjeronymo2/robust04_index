"The situation in East Timor is now different from the past.  I do not think the former Fretilin president or whoever wants to  visit there will ever be able to agitate the people," Major  General Theo Syafei told reporters in Denpasar, Bali.    Theo heads the Udayana Military Command which oversees  security in Bali, East and West Nusa Tenggara and East Timor.    Theo said the visit of former Fretilin leader Rogerio Lobato  and former Portuguese general Galvao de Melo will prove that  Indonesia has nothing to hide in East Timor.    That also applies to the condition of remaining Fretilin  members, he said, adding that the armed separatist movement no  longer poses any serious threat to security in East Timor.    Fretilin has been waging a guerrilla war since the decision  of the majority of East Timorese to integrate with Indonesia in  1976. It was dealt with a severe blow when its commander, Jose  Alexandre "Xanana" Gusmao was arrested in November 1991.    Many Fretilin leaders have found sanctuary in Portugal,  their  former colonizer.    Indonesia and Portugal are still negotiating, under the UN  auspices, to settle the East Timor question. The world body  still regards Lisbon as the administering power of East Timor.    Theo said that from the visit, East Timorese opposing the  integration will see for themselves that the Portuguese support  the rebels have been counting on all this time is nothing but  hollow dreams.    On the question of East Timorese who want to go home after  nearly 20 years in exile, Theo said they will have difficulties  if they want to obtain Indonesian citizenship.    "And if they only want to come to create disturbances in  East  Timor or to reincite anti-integration sentiment they will have  to face the military," he warned.    Theo accused East Timorese who have spread negative  information about Indonesia's rule in the province of having  neglected the truth for their own personal gains.    Lopes da Cruz, Indonesia's special ambassador for East  Timor,  said earlier that Lobato and de Melo are expected to visit  Indonesia beginning on January 4.    The visit follows a meeting earlier this month near London,  where a pro-Indonesian delegation led by da Cruz met Timorese  exiles for the first time since the integration.    "You could say this (visit) is part of Indonesia's  confidence-building measures, but we want to emphasize these are  non-political meetings," da Cruz said.    Lopes da Cruz said Lobato's visit to Jakarta will be the  first such trip by a Timorese in exile to Indonesia.    He said de Melo will visit Dili but Lobato has yet to decide  if he will.    Lobato served as minister of defense during Fretilin's brief  rule in 1975.    De Melo is a leader of the newly-formed Portugal-Indonesia  Friendship Association, whose founder, businessman Manuel Macedo  visited Indonesia in a much publicized trip in August.    Indonesian officials have said they hope the Friendship  Association will help re-open diplomatic ties between Lisbon and  Jakarta.    The Portuguese daily EXPRESSO earlier this month said Lisbon  has rejected a UN proposal that the two countries install  diplomats in third-party embassies in each other's countries.</p>

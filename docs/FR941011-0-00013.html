This rule implements section 302(e)(2) of the Miscellaneous and Technical Immigration and Naturalization Amendments of 1991 (MTINA), which amended section 161 (c)(1) of the Immigration Act of 1990 (IMMACT). This rule is necessary to ensure full public awareness of the October 1, 1993 deadline to file an employment-based petition, if the underlying labor certification was filed before October 1, 1991. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> October 11, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Michael W. Straus, Senior Immigration Examiner, Adjudications Division, Immigration and Naturalization Service, 425 I Street, NW., Room 3214, Washington, DC 20536, telephone (202) 514&hyph;3228. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> On November 29, 1991, the Service published a final rule on employment-based petitions in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  at 56 FR 60897&hyph;60913. The final rule, codified at 8 CFR 204.5(d), provided that the priority date for an employment-based petition accompanied by a labor certification shall be the date on which any office within the employment service system of the Department of Labor accepted the request for labor certification. A priority date determines when an alien who has had an immigrant visa petition approved on his or her behalf may submit his or her application for permanent resident status or an immigrant visa.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Subsequent to the promulgation of this regulation, the President signed into law the Miscellaneous and Technical Immigration and Naturalization Amendments of 1991, (MTINA) Public Law 102&hyph;232, dated December 12, 1991. Section 302(e)(2) of the MTINA, which amended section 161(c)(1) of the Immigration Act of 1990, (IMMACT) Public Law 102&hyph;649, dated November 29, 1990, addressed, among other things, the transition of labor certifications filed before October 1, 1991 into the new employment-based immigrant visa categories created by IMMACT. In this regard, section 302(e)(2) of MTINA provides that, in order to maintain the priority date of a labor certification application filed in connection with an employment-based petition which was submitted to a state employment office before October 1, 1991, the employer must file a petition under section 203(b) of the Act before October 1, 1993. Section 302(e)(2) of MTINA further provides that if the Department of Labor approves a pre-October 1, 1991 labor certification application subsequent to October 1, 1993, the employer must file a petition under section 203(b) of the Act within 60 days of the date of certification to maintain the pre-October 1, 1991 priority date. Although not specifically provided for in section 302(e)(2) of MTINA, the Service has interpreted that section to require that, in the case of labor certifications which the Department of Labor certified between August 2, 1993 and October 1, 1993, a petition under section 203(b) of the Act must be filed within 60 days after the date of certification to preserve the earlier priority date. The Service does not believe that Congress intended to provide those employers less than 60 days from the date of certification to file a petition under section 203(b) of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To implement section 302(e)(2) of MTINA, the Service issued an interim rule with request for comments on January 5, 1994 at 59 FR 501&hyph;502, providing that in the case of labor certifications accepted for processing by any office within the employment service system of the Department of Labor before October 1, 1991, the sponsoring employer must file a petition under section 203(b) of the Act before October 1, 1993, or within 60 days after the date of certification by the Department of Labor, whichever is later, in order to maintain the pre-October 1, 1991 priority date. If the petitioning employer fails to maintain the pre-October 1, 1991 priority date, the priority date shall be the date a new employment-based petition is properly filed with the Service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Palestinians take positive peace talks line: Delegates see a narrowing of differences with Israelis PALESTINIANS last night gave their most upbeat assessment of peace talks with Israel since the process was launched in Madrid last October. A senior Palestinian official said that proposals for a common agenda tabled by Israel yesterday represented a 'considerable narrowing' of the gap between them. Waving a copy of the Israeli document, he said: 'For the first time I feel as if the Israelis are really negotiating. This document, which responds to our proposals of Tuesday, represents a considerable narrowing. With some amendments, which should not be too difficult, this can be a document we will sign. And if we do sign, it will be a real breakthrough because this is not just a procedural matter. There is also political substance to it.' The senior Palestinian official said that he hoped the common agenda would be ready for signing when negotiators returned from a 10-day recess on September 14. All five teams at the Middle East peace talks - Israel, the Palestinians, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon - have also agreed to extend this round of negotiations, the sixth since Madrid, until September 24 to compensate for days lost next week. Most of the Israeli delegation is returning to Jerusalem today for 'intensive consultations'. President George Bush and Mr Lawrence Eagleburger, the acting US secretary of state, are also lending their weight to the process. Mr Bush had a private dinner with King Hussein of Jordan - who is recovering from major surgery - at the White House on Tuesday evening, and Mr Eagleburger is seeing each of the heads of delegation. Mr Yossi Gal, the Israeli spokesman, said yesterday that the negotiating team had worked all night on the common agenda proposals which incorporated ideas put forward by the Palestinians and 'tried to take account of their sensitivities'. He added: 'Every step brings us closer to a common agenda.' The agenda includes such items as the concept for Palestinian self-government in the occupied territories, elections, ideas for peaceful co-existence, and confidence-building measures to be taken in conjunction with negotiations. It was also agreed in principle yesterday to set up two sub-committees on human rights issues and water resources. The senior Palestinian official said he was particularly pleased Israel had included references in its latest document to UN resolution 242, which enshrines the principle of exchanging occupied land for peace. 'This had already been given to the Syrians and Jordanians. Now we have it,too,' he said. Reuter adds from Tel Aviv: Israel's prime minister, Mr Yitzhak Rabin, told a group of industrialists yesterday he expected agreement within a year on a plan for Palestinian self-rule in Israeli-occupied lands.' I have said in the past that I hope to reach agreement within nine to 12 months. With all the difficulties, I still believe it.'</p>

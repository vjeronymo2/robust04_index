			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ibrahim al-Bishari, envoy to the Arab League </F> and "general coordinator for Egyptian-Libyan relations," by an  unidentified reporter in Cairo; date not given]    [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] [Reporter] Where do relations,  and both direct and indirect dialogue, stand between you and the  United States?    [Al-Bishari] Some fraternal countries, like Egypt and  Tunisia, are engaged in persistent efforts in this regard. We  are pinning great hopes on the constant and important efforts  being made by President Mubarak to address this issue. We hope  that these efforts will bear fruit. Hence, our contacts with  the United States have not been interrupted, thwarted, or  suspended. All that there is to it is that the issue has become  complicated after the tightening of the sanctions against us.  The issue has become part of efforts by big powers to finalize  some arrangements in the region, given the interests they have  in it. This has been manifested in what is taking place in  Palestine, the calls made for the launching of a Middle East  market, as well as the situation in Somalia, Bosnia-Herzegovina,  the Gulf, and Iraq. [passage omitted]    [Reporter] Now that the key witness in the Lockerbie affair  has retracted his testimony, what is your position on this  issue? How can you take advantage of this new development?    [Al-Bishari] We are trying to make international and  regional  organizations informed about this new development as quickly as  possible. We will benefit from this development. Likewise, we  will keep the permanent members of the UN Security Council,  particularly the PRC, informed of this new development, given  its weight at the UN General Assembly, as well as its  convictions regarding Libya's innocence. This new development  may also influence public opinion, as well as the policies of  nonpermanent members of the UN Security Council, which were  pressured to vote against us.    [Reporter] Why did Libya receive the Serbian foreign  minister  at a time when barbaric massacres against the Bosnian people are  being escalated? Doesn't this undermine your credibility with  the Muslim world?    [Al-Bishari] Libya is making honest efforts to end the  calamity of the Bosnian people. We believe that it is necessary  to hold direct talks with the major party to the crisis, namely  the Serbs, if we are to influence them and induce them to end  the massacres against Muslims. This is a serious effort on our  part. [passage omitted]    [Reporter] Libya was reported to have had a hand in the  disappearance of onetime Libyan Foreign Minister Mansur  al-Kikhya, and that the Libyan Government had a vested interest  in his disappearance. Does what happened prejudice your  relations with the Egyptians?    [Al-Bishari] We are as surprised as the next man by his  disappearance. We do not regard him as an enemy. If anything,  there has not been any break in his relations with Libyan  Government officials. We have been and still are bound together  by an open and friendly relationship. Our lines of  communications were open. His family remains in Libya and is  being treated with all respect and appreciation. The man posed  no threat whatsoever in order for us to move against him and  thus jeopardize our Egyptian relations and interests in Egypt.  Al-Kikhya is a man of stature. He once served as minister in  view of the revolution's confidence in him. He left office  having reached the age of retirement. I recall one day the  brother colonel [al-Qadhdhafi] asked that we contact him in  Paris and ask him to go to Algeria as a member of a Libyan  delegation when Ahmed Ben-Bella returned to his country.  [passage omitted]    [Reporter] How do you react to reports that Libyan-Egyptian  relations are strained and that Dr. Usamah al-Baz's mission in  Libya last month was a failure?    [Al-Bishari] There's no truth in these reports. Nor will we  allow such a thing to happen. Ours is a strategic relationship  that we will not allow anyone to sabotage. In none of the  assignments entrusted to Dr. al-Baz by President Mubarak to seek  a way out of the Lockerbie affair has he failed. Besides, as  far as al-Kikhya's disappearance is concerned, Libya is not in  the dock for al-Baz to go to Tripoli to talk about the affair.  Again, the man is not an enemy of ours. We wish him a safe and  speedy return to his children and wife. We hope the mystery of  his disappearance will be solved. We -- Egyptians and Libyans  alike -- are distressed by his disappearance.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The PHLX notes that since the time of the most recent increase in position limits, the size of the underlying currency market has grown exponentially. <FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>  Since 1986, average daily trading volume in PHLX FCOs has grown from 30,880 to 48,246 contracts in 1992. <FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>  As of February 1993, average daily volume was 61,062 contracts. Monthly volume and open interest have also increased dramatically since 1986, especially in certain FCOs. Further, the highest monthly open interest in FCOs reached 995,941 in 1986; 1,188,570 contracts in 1987; 1,190,389 contracts in 1992; and 1,338,458 in 1993. Total annual volume has increased from 7,905,239 contracts in 1986 to 12,158,069 contracts in 1992 to 13,101,365 contracts in 1993. Total FCO trading volume as of July 1994 was 5,755,939 contracts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 13 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> In 1989, total gross global foreign exchange turnover was estimated to be $932 billion per day and net global turnover was estimated to be $640 billion per day.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Bank for International Settlements (``BIS'') Survey of Foreign Exchange Market Activity, April 1989. In 1992, total gross global foreign exchange turnover was estimated to be $1,354 billion per day, a 35% increase since April 1989. After allowing for the elimination of local and cross-border double-counting and estimated gaps in reporting ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> e.g. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> , exchange-traded options and futures and countries not providing counterparty information for over-the-counter transactions), global ``net-net'' exchange market turnover in spot, forward and derivative contracts may be estimated at $880 billion per day during April 1992.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  BIS Central Bank Survey of Foreign Exchange Market Activity in April 1992, March 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 14 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Average daily volume in foreign currency options was 14,829 contracts in 1985 and 30,880 contracts in 1986. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In light of these market changes, the PHLX believes that increased position and exercise limits are necessary to add depth and liquidity to the market. Because of the large size of the underlying market in foreign currencies, the PHLX does not believe that higher position and exercise limits will increase manipulative concerns. Moreover, the Exchange believes that these increases are particularly appropriate because the FCO market attracts a large number of institutional and corporate investors who have substantial hedging needs and execute block-sized <FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>  transactions in FCOs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> For the purposes of this proposal, the PHLX defines ``block-sized orders'' as orders of 100 contracts or more.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  July 27 Letter,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  note 4. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although the Exchange may grant position limit exemptions in the interest of fair and orderly markets, the Exchange believes that it is more direct and logical to establish more appropriate position limits for all investors. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The PHLX believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6 of the Act, in general, and, in particular, with Section 6(b)(5), in that it is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade as well as to protect investors and the public interest. The PHLX believes that the increased depth and liquidity of the FCO market should promote just and equitable principles of trade. In addition, the PHLX believes that the proposed approach to FCO position limits should ensure that the applicable limit is reasonably related to trading volume. The PHLX believes that this, in turn, should result in position limit levels that serve the purposes of protecting investors and the public interest as well as preventing unfair acts and practices, such as manipulation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange and, in particular, the requirements of Section 6(b)(5). <FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>  Specifically, the Commission believes that the proposal to raise the position limit for only those FCOs with annual trading volume of at least 3,500,000 contracts should help to accommodate the needs of investors and market participants while ensuring that the increased limits are only available for those currencies with extremely large and liquid markets. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 16 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. &sect;78f(b)(5) (1982). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In this regard, the Commission believes, as it has stated in the past, that although position and exercise limits for FCOs must be sufficient to protect the options and related markets from disruptions by manipulation, the limits must not be established at levels that are so low as to discourage participation in the options market by institutions and other investors with substantial hedging needs or to prevent market makers from adequately meeting their obligations to maintain a fair and orderly market. <FOOTCITE>17</FOOTCITE>  In its proposal, the PHLX states that the FCO market attracts a large number of institutional and corporate investors who have substantial needs and who execute block-sized transactions in FCOs. In addition, the PHLX believes that trading in active currencies could migrate to the OTC market if traders continue to be restricted by the PHLX's current FCO position limits. In light of the size of the FCO market and the needs of FCO investors and market makers, the Commission believes that the PHLX's proposal is a reasonable effort to accommodate the needs of market participants and to help the Exchange remain competitive with the OTC market for FCOs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 17 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Securities Exchange Act Release No. 22479,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  note 11. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

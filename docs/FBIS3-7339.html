The two countries shared this view during talks between  Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed and General Secretary  of the C.C. [Central Committee], the Communist Party of Vietnam  Do Muoi, an aide to Do Muoi said.    The aide said that the U.S. military reinforcement in South  Korea was "unwarranted and an act of provocation against the  North", adding: "This spectacular military display by Washington  against Pyongyang must be taken seriously."    The aide contended that Washington had triggered tensions in  the Korean peninsula in the hope of diverting world attention  away from growing U.S. domestic problems, President Bill  Clinton's fate in the "Whitewater scandal" and other issues.</p>

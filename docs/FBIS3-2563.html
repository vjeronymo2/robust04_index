			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus" page: "Weekly Notes" column by Assistant </F> Editor Jackie Sam: "PR Exercise Will Endear PLA Soldiers to the  Public"]    [Text] If Mr Liu Guinan, vice-director of the People's  Liberation Army (PLA) Guangzhou political department, is to be  believed, China will soon be throwing open some PLA camps to  Hong Kong people. These are camps where soldiers sent here in  1997 are being trained.    This will be a PR exercise. No more, no less. Or,  re-phrased in the language of the Cold War, a campaign to win  the hearts and minds of Hong Kong people. It's a good start.  Hong Kong people have to get used to the PLA and vice versa.  The last thing we would want to see in 1997 is the PLA regarded  as an occupation army. Or the PLA treating the Hong Kong  population with hostility.    Widespread anxiety about a PLA presence is a fact of life.  The reasons are historical. Beijing is aware of this,  otherwise it would not have gone to such lengths to select and  train the men and women who will be stationed here. Their  special preparation includes the study of Hong Kong laws, way of  life, languages (Cantonese and English), and all the  nitty-gritty which makes this territory so exasperatingly  unique. Regular visits to the Guangdong camps by Hong Kong  people will foster understanding, goodwill and -- hopefully --  lasting bonds.    Hong Kong Affairs Advisers and the territory's National  People's Congress deputies appear to be at the top of the PLA  invitation list, presumably because they are important people.  Giving important people first crack is, of course, the  Chinese-way in such matters. But if the object of this exercise  is winning hearts and minds, the people who matter are the  ordinary folk. Will the common folk get invited? Or are  invitations to be confined to community leaders? Will  grassroots leaders like District Board [DB] members get a chance  to visit the camps? Will all these people -- DB members or  common people -- have to pass political muster, meaning their  views must be acceptable to China? These are some of the  questions which need to be asked. Because the converted have  less anxieties about a PLA presence than the apolitical majority  or those opposed to the transfer of sovereignty. Inviting only  the converted will not advance the PLA cause of building  bridges, making friends. Ultimately the whole population has to  get along with the PLA, and vice versa.    There are other areas the PLA can usefully explore to  achieve  its aims. Inviting university undergrads to participate in  language training would help to foster better understanding  between the young soldiers and Hong Kong youth. Another way  would be to liaise with the Hong Kong Administration to enable  batches of PLA men to visit the territory informally, to  familiarise them with the sights and sounds of Hong Kong. If  this was done on a regular basis, the PLA contingent would not  be total strangers on arrival in 1997.    If the Hong Kong Administration is sincere about a smooth  transition, it would offer to arrange such familiarisation tours  without waiting to be asked. It would also be reassuring to  Hong Kong people if China could enact laws covering the  behaviour of its troops in the territory speedily and  disseminate them. This way both Hong Kong people and the  individual soldiers would know exactly what each other's rights  and responsibilities are.    Hong Kong people want to be assured that PLA men posted here  would be subjected to the rule of law. They would want to be  assured, too, that their public behaviour would be subject to  civilian control. What goes on within the camp where Hong Kong  people and Hong Kong interests are not involved is another  matter. But a PLA officer who gets involved in a drunken brawl  with a local in Wan Chai, or runs up a bill he cannot settle  must be subject to local laws. If a soldier has committed an  offence outside his camp and the aggrieved party is a local, it  would be most reassuring to know that a policeman can arrest him  and deal with him under Hong Kong laws, without a superior PLA  officer having the right to intervene. The PLA, undoubtedly,  has this in mind. But, for most people here, seeing will be  believing.    The PLA is not the monster that a minority in Hong Kong have  made it out to be. But the PLA is made up of many soldiers, all  human beings. And Hong Kong is a city of countless temptations.  Hong Kong people are also far more individualistic than their  mainland counterparts. The PLA is off to a good start. But it  needs to keep in mind at all times its aim to endear itself to  Hong Kong people.</p>

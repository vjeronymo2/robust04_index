			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / Move on council-house mortgages THE GOVERNMENT is to press building societies to be more willing to provide mortgages on homes that have been bought by former council tenants. Ministers will be holding meetings with the Council of Mortgage Lenders in the run-up to a new campaign which will encourage council tenants to exercise their right to buy their homes. The lenders will be urged to end their reluctance to provide mortgages for some former council properties, particularly flats. Some Conservative councillors say that the building societies' attitude can lead to former tenants who have bought their homes being unable to move because prospective purchasers cannot get mortgages. When complaints were first raised on this matter last summer the council assured ministers that if a building society had once provided a mortgage on a property then it would continue to be ready to provide one in future. This has run into difficulties however, because of a change to mortgage indemnity insurance which makes it harder for building societies to obtain insurance on such mortgages. The tightening of insurance policies has led the council to call for local authorities to take a role in helping to provide the insurance. Ministers are determined that the problem will not hinder the new campaign and are anxious to get an agreement with building societies before it starts later this month. Ministers will also discuss with the lenders the prospect of providing fixed-rate mortgages on former council properties, so that potential purchasers will know how much they will have to pay over the next few years. The campaign will also stress the cash incentive scheme, through which a tenant in, for example, a tower block flat which they do not want to buy can receive a cash lump sum towards buying a home in the private sector.</p>

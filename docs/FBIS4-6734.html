			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 22 (YONHAP) -- The government and the  ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP) have decided to form a  special organization to deal with North Korean escapees, DLP  policy coordinator Paek Nam-chi said Friday.    The organization is to be comprised of officials from the  Economic Planning Board, the Agency for National Security  Planning, the National Unification Board, and the Health and  Social Affairs, Foreign and Labor Ministries.    The government and the ruling party held a joint meeting on  foreign affairs Friday attended by Chong Che-mun, chairman of  the National Assembly's Foreign Affairs and National Unification  Committee, and Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu to discuss handling  escapees from logging camps in Siberia and other North Koreans  fleeing their country.    The soon-to-be-formed organization will study revision of  related legislation including the law to protect North Korean  defectors here as well as enact a law to protect refugees, the  official said.    The body is also expected to work out concrete measures to  help North Korean refugees in South Korea -- providing them with  opportunities for vocational education and social adaptation  training, among others.    Hundreds of North Koreans have escaped from Siberian logging  yards, testifying later to rampant human rights violations  inside the camps.    The government and DLP officials agreed to devise mid- and  long-term measures as the number of escapees from logging camps  in Siberia and from North Korea is expected to keep increasing.    The officials decided to concentrate on strengthening the  North Koreans' ability to stand on their own here rather than  giving them financial support.    They also established the principle that North Koreans  staying in China after escaping from logging camps in Russia or  North Korea can resettle in South Korea if they wish.    The government plans to hold diplomatic negotiations with  the  Chinese Government on the matter, according to party coordinator  Park.    Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Han reported recent developments  in the North Korean nuclear problem to the meeting.    "The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) sent North  Korea a positive answer to Pyongyang's proposal that IAEA  inspectors visit Yongbyon and witness the changing of nuclear  fuel rods at the 5-megawatt reactor," Han said.    The IAEA, Han said, responded that nuclear safeguards  activities are necessary to complete its inspections and  proposed that Pyongyang permit further checks of nuclear  facilities it was denied access to last March and to ensure the  continuity of safeguards.    "IAEA inspection of the 5-megawatt reactor is important in  securing the nuclear transparency of North Korea," Han said.</p>

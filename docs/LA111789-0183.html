			<p><P> November 17, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> EAST GERMANS ANGERED BY REPORTS OF ATHLETES' PERKS  </P> <P> East Germans have gone from cheering to loathing top athletes after reports of  special privileges appeared in the country's media.  </P> <P> Citing a report by the East Berlin-based radio station Berliner Rundfunk, the  Bild newspaper said today that unknown persons had "demolished world champion  swimmer Heike Friederich's car."  </P> <P> In addition, the tires on ice speed skater Constanze Moser's car were slit, and  world champion cyclist Uwe Ampler was purposely knocked from his racing bike  during training, Bild said.  </P> <P> "First Adored, Now Hated," Bild said in the story's headline. The report did  not say where in East Germany the attacks against the athletes took place.  </P> <P> Bild said the incidents occurred after East German news reports of huge gifts  given to sports figures, including swimming star Kristin Otto and Katarina  Witt, the Olympic and world figure skating champion.  </P> <P> Otto reportedly was given more than $30,000 for winning six gold medals at the  Seoul Olympics, and Witt received her own villa, Bild said.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, East Germany's state-run youth newspaper Junge Welt (Young World)  criticized the Communist country's sports program as "wasting millions in  foreign exchange" in a blind hunt for medals.  </P> <P> Junge Welt suggested that East Germany consider allowing its top sports figures  to earn money through commercialization to help fight the country's deep  economic crisis and not put the burden of supporting them "on the backs of our  population."  </P></p>

[passage  omitted]    [Video shows correspondent and the government session] The  Herceg-Bosna Government arrived in Vitez today and held its  first session here. This is the first time that leaders of the  Croat Republic of Herceg-Bosna have come to Croatian central  Bosnia.    At the beginning of the session, Vice Prime Minister Ante  Valeta, who lives in Vitez, gave a report on the work of all  bodies in central Bosnia over the past few months. The  conclusion was that the political and military leaders of the  Croat nation of central Bosnia had organized an effective  defense of their areas. Defense Minister Vlado Soljic stressed:    [Soljic] It is enough to say that we have realized the main  goals if we have the Croatian state as a guarantee for the  freedom and rights of all Croats, and if we have sovereign  rights in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    [Sagolj] Prime Minister Jadranko Prlic stressed, among other  things, that all the system's institutions must be further  strengthened. In connection with that, the government today  established its tasks.    [Prlic] The war has not stopped. The war is not over. In  that respect, we must remain vigilant.    [Sagolj] Minister Mile Akmadzic informed the leaders of  central Bosnia about the Vienna and Washington Agreements. It  was particularly stressed at the session that now was the time  to draw up reconstruction plans, but, of course, without  neglecting the strengthening of the defense system.

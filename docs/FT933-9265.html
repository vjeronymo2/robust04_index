			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / UK Company News: BOC down 8% in third quarter - Slowdown prompts warning over outcome for full year BOC GROUP, the industrial gases producer, reported a sharp slowdown in profits for its third quarter to end-June. Pre-tax profits in the quarter were down 8 per cent at Pounds 81.5m. The company also warned that full year profits were unlikely to match last year's. Profits for the nine months to end-June were up 4 per cent at Pounds 261.6m (Pounds 250.9m), on sales ahead 12 per cent at Pounds 2.4bn. However, at constant exchange rates profits would have been down 1 per cent, while sales would have risen by only 6 per cent, the company said. BOC said its gases business in the quarter suffered from a disappointing economic environment worldwide. The environment for health care was similarly lethargic. However, it had continued to expand in new areas, acquiring industrial gas businesses in Poland and Germany. Forane, the group's long-established anaesthetic - which lost its patent protection in the US market early this year - was now expected to lose half its US market to generic competition. It would be some time before Suprane, BOC's new anaesthetic which has been on sale in the US since April, made a significant contribution to profits. The vacuum technology business showed a sharp improvement, with operating profits in the nine months almost doubled. This was mostly due to recovery in the semiconductor market, which BOC supplies from its Edwards High Vacuum subsidiary. Recovery was most marked in more sophisticated processor chips made in the US. The Japanese market, which is more biased to basic memory chips, had not seen the same pick-up. Nine month operating profits on gases were Pounds 228.5m (Pounds 217m) on sales of Pounds 1.7bn (Pounds 1.49bn). Healthcare operating profits were Pounds 73.7m (Pounds 73m) on sales of Pounds 442.6m (Pounds 388.4m). Profits on the vacuum business and distribution were Pounds 23m (Pounds 12.2m) on sales of Pounds 256.2m (Pounds 201.9m). After interest charges of Pounds 64.2m (Pounds 54.9m), tax of Pounds 89.6m (Pounds 83.3m) and minorities of Pounds 14.4m (Pounds 9.6m), net profit was Pounds 157.6m (Pounds 158m). Earnings per share were 33.24p (33.47p).</p>

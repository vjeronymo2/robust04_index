			<p><P> August 18, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PERSPECTIVE ON AMERICAN OBJECTIVES;  </P> <P> ... NO, THIS IS THE TURNING POINT;  </P> <P> ACTION IN THE GULF MUST NOT STOP SHORT OF REMOVING SADDAM HUSSEIN AND HIS  WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION.  </P> <P> It is now fashionably cynical to say that the only reason the United States is  in the Persian Gulf is oil. Oil is, of course, a major reason. But not the only  one.  </P> <P> We are living an extraordinary moment. With the abdication of Soviet power, the  world has been transformed from a bipolar into a unipolar one. The United  States and the alliance it leads have unprecedented control of the  international order -- an order whose benignity and humanity have been  testified to yet again by the rush of the newly liberated peoples of Eastern  Europe to join it.  </P> <P> Saddam Hussein's Iraq presents a challenge to that order as direct as Nazi  Germany's to the order of the 1930s. If he is permitted the unprovoked conquest  and plunder of a defenseless neighbor, then the post-Cold War peace dissolves  into chaos. Only this time, the nightmare will be worse and even more  universal. It will be the nightmare not just of indiscriminate aggression but  of indiscriminate aggression with missiles, poison gas and, soon, nuclear  weapons.  </P> <P> The stakes are high not because this is the first test of the new unipolar  system presided over by the West. And first tests establish ground rules. If  Hussein gets away with swallowing Kuwait, it will be clear that this is a world  with no rules and no one in charge. Not only will he be back for more, but  every tyrant with ambition and an army will get the message that everything  goes. And every potential victim will get the message that it must either arm  itself to the teeth or, like King Hussein of Jordan, buy protection by siding  with the regional thug of the day.  </P> <P> Because the stakes are so high, the United States has to be clear about its  objectives in the Gulf. And because the stakes are not just oil, the objective  has to be more than just the protection and preservation of Saudi Arabia from  Iraq. We have three other important goals:  </P> <P> * Unconditional withdrawal of Iraq from Kuwait, with the restoration to power  of the emir.  </P> <P> * Removal from power of Saddam Hussein.  </P> <P> * Elimination of Iraq's capacity for mass murder.  </P> <P> This last objective -- the destruction of Iraq's unconventional capacities: its  chemical-weapons factories, long-range missiles and nuclear-weapons facilities  -- can be achieved only if Iraq provokes a shooting war with the United States.  In which case, purely as a matter of self-defense, this should be our first  objective.  </P> <P> In the absence of war, the United States must settle for nothing less than  Hussein's unconditional surrender of Kuwait and his downfall. These two  objectives are linked. The one will lead to the other. Saddam has staked so  much on his Kuwaiti adventure that a forced, unconditional withdrawal would be  more humiliation than his rule could endure.  </P> <P> That is, if the blockade does not topple him first. Hungry people have a way of  replacing their leaders. Hussein is not a madman. He is a cold and calculating  thug who has this time miscalculated. Before starvation sets in, he will seek  some face-saving compromise. Any compromise, any negotiation, any face-saving  formula for getting Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait would be a grave error.  Hussein should be granted no say in Kuwaiti affairs, no territorial or  financial concessions, nothing that saves face.  </P> <P> To save Hussein's face is to save Hussein. It would be an astonishing  misreading of our interests, and those of a stable world order, to save an  adventurer who, if he makes it through this crisis, will undoubtedly be back,  next time with nuclear weapons.  </P> <P> The notions of shame and honor carry extraordinary weight in Arab culture.  Which is why we don't need secret agents or assassination plots to get rid of  Hussein. We need only deny him an honorable retreat. He will not last long if  he returns from little Kuwait to nothing but grieving widows, an empty  treasury, and shame.  </P></p>

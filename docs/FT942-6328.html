			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / UK may stem imports of subsidised building steel: Companies unable to compete with foreign rivals Regulations to stem imports into Britain of cut-price subsidised construction steel, mainly from Italy and Spain, are being considered by the UK government. Transport and Environment Department officials are working with the British Constructional Steelwork Association to devise quality control and company registration schemes to make it harder for foreign companies to break into the UK. The standards will be similar to schemes operating in other European countries and will be carefully worded so as not to fall foul of European Union trade liberalisation rules. Companies including British Steel have become increasingly irritated that foreign rivals find it easy to win work in the UK while, they claim, many continental European markets remain heavily regulated. They are particularly concerned at a sharp rise in the number of UK bridge contracts awarded to Italian and Spanish companies. They claim that they use cheap subsidised steel produced in their own countries to undercut competitors. There were strong protests by British companies and MPs 19 months ago when Cimolai, an Italian steelwork fabricator, won a Pounds 7m contract to supply steelwork for the Pounds 300m new river Severn crossing. The BCSA estimates that Pounds 30m of work, representing roughly half of all steel road bridge contracts, has been placed with Italian or Spanish contractors during the past 12 months. The largest is a 3,600-tonne contract to cross the A406 Angel Road in north London, awarded to Ensidesa, a Spanish steelwork contractor. Wimpey, the UK construction group, is the main contractor for the road contract. BIT of Italy recently won a 1,600-tonne contract for a crossing of the A417 Brockworth bypass near Gloucester for which Amec is main contractor. Main contractors say they are working for little or no profit margin and have no choice but to accept the lowest price from steelwork subcontractors. Initiatives being pursued by the UK government include a quality assurance scheme requiring British and foreign companies to be certified by a recognised body that they can meet standards drawn up by the transport department. The Department of the Environment is proposing a registration scheme requiring companies to meet financial, environmental, technical and health and safety standards before being allowed on tender lists. Environment officials say construction companies operating in Spain must be registered before they can do business. Italy also requires companies to register for various categories of public works.

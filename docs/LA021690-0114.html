			<p><P> February 16, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NIKE ALLEGES INFRINGEMENT BY L.A. GEAR  </P> <P> Nike Inc., the nation's leading producer of athletic shoes, on Thursday filed  suit against rival shoemaker L.A. Gear, alleging patent and design  infringements.  </P> <P> L.A. Gear denied the allegations.  </P> <P> The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, claims that L.A. Gear  incorporated a patented performance-related feature of Nike's Air Jordan  basketball shoes into a Gear product called MVP-1. The suit also alleges that  six other L.A. Gear products infringe on that patent, a design in the sole of  the Air Jordan shoe.  </P> <P> In addition, Nike claims that L.A. Gear has violated other commercial trade  laws by producing MVP-1, alleging that the shoe too closely resembles the look  of the the red, white and black Air Jordan.  </P> <P> Nike, based in Beaverton, Ore., is seeking unspecified damages and a ban on the  sale of the Gear products. Air Jordan, promoted by basketball superstar Michael  Jordan, has accounted for more than $45 million in sales since its introduction  in September, 1988, said Lindsay Stewart, general counsel at Nike. Air Jordan,  offered at a suggested retail price of $110, is the top-selling Nike shoe,  Stewart said.  </P> <P> "Our position is that it (Air Jordan) would be even more successful if it were  not competing against a product that infringes . . . on our property rights,"  Stewart said.  </P> <P> However, L.A. Gear is unaware of any commercial infringements, said Gil N.  Schwartzberg, the Los Angeles shoemaker's executive vice president and chief  administrative officer.  </P> <P> "We're very careful about this kind of thing," Schwartzberg said. "We have our  shoes examined by outside designers. We have our shoes reviewed routinely and  we have been advised that the shoes do not infringe on any rights."  </P> <P> Schwartzberg said the MVP-1, which retails for about $80, was introduced in  June and accounts for less than 1% of L.A. Gear's sales.  </P></p>

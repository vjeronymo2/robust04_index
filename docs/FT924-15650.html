			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / US Senate approves IMF quota rise and Israel backing THE US Senate yesterday finally approved an aid package to provide both the country's Dollars 12bn quota in the International Monetary Fund's capital increase and Dollars 10bn in loan guarantees for Israel. Neither measure would incur a direct cost to the US taxpayer, unless Israel were to default on its loans or the IMF to got bankrupt, but both have had rocky passages through Congress. President George Bush tried to win support for the unpopular IMF quota increase by attaching it to a package providing aid to Russia and the other republics of the former Soviet Union, but many of his own Republican party supporters still baulked at it. Besides the Israeli loan guarantees and the IMF quota increase, the appropriations bill approved by the Senate yesterday includes about Dollars 14bn of foreign aid. Since the US is by far the IMF's largest member, passage of the quota increase was critical to the implementation of the quota increase, which would increase the IMF's capital base by 50 per cent to SDR135.2bn (Dollars 198bn). Without the increase, IMF officials expected their resources to fall to critical levels by the end of the year. Washington officials were optimistic that a small appropriation for United Nations family planning activities, which the Bush administration has used as grounds for a veto, would be dropped in a final conference to reconcile the House of Representatives and Senate versions of the bill. In a separate vote, the Senate ratified the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, by which the US and the former Soviet republics agree to cut their arsenals of nuclear warheads.</p>

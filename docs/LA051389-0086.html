			<p><P> May 13, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YANKEES QUICKLY JUMP ON ABBOTT, CRUISE TO WIN;  </P> <P> EARLIER RAINOUTS CAUSE ROOKIE TO DRAW HOT TEAM  </P> <P> Jesse Barfield, Tom Brookens and the rest of the New York Yankees had the  greatest immediate impact on Jim Abbott's third major league defeat Friday  night, but the seeds for the Angels' 5-2 loss at Anaheim Stadium were sown by  the rainstorm that washed out last Sunday's game in Toronto.  </P> <P> One postponement led to another, the second being the postponement of Abbott's  next start, which was supposed to have been Wednesday in Detroit against the  floundering Tigers but wound up getting delayed until Friday against the  recently resurgent Yankees.  </P> <P> Funny what two extra days can do to a guy.  </P> <P> Instead of Pat Sheridan or Ken Williams or whoever Sparky Anderson is leading  off these days, Abbott had to deliver his first pitches of the evening to  Rickey Henderson. And by the time Abbott had finished pitching to Henderson,  the Yankee left fielder had driven the baseball off the base of the wall in  left-center for a double. He was soon to score on a sacrifice fly by Don  Mattingly.  </P> <P> Another Yankee run followed in the second inning, with Abbott loading the bases  and Steve Sax singling off the glove of Angel third baseman Jack Howell.  </P> <P> And finally, in the third inning, it all fell apart for Abbott.  </P> <P> Barfield, who was a Toronto Blue Jay the last time the Angels played in  Anaheim, opened the third with a home run, his seventh of the season and his  third as a Yankee.  </P> <P> Steve Balboni then singled, and one out later, Brookens sent his third home run  of the season over the left-field fence.  </P> <P> Abbott was down, 5-0, and two outs later, he was out of the game, his record on  its way to 2-3.  </P> <P> "He really seemed uptight tonight," Angel Manager Doug Rader said. "In all  honesty, he didn't have his very best stuff. That 2-0 pitch to Barfield was  kind of a goose ball, and he hit it out."  </P> <P> A goose ball, apparently, is any pitch that makes a pitcher want to duck. In  this case, Abbott reported it was a fastball, delivered too high and too  straight.  </P> <P> "I fell behind in the count and threw him a high fastball over the plate,"  Abbott said. "That's his pitch. You can't do that."  </P> <P> This was the second time in less than a month that Abbott had been victimized  by bad weather. In late April, he had a start rained out in Chicago, which  forced him to delay his first big league victory until April 24 against  Baltimore -- coming on nine days' rest.  </P> <P> Friday, Abbott attempted to beat the Yankees while pitching on six days' rest.  The result was his shortest, and most ragged, outing as an Angel.  </P> <P> In three innings, Abbott made 78 pitches, yielding six hits and three walks.  All told, he put nine Yankees on base -- and five of them scored.  </P> <P> Henderson got things rolling early with his first-inning double. He advanced to  third base on an infield out by Sax and came home on Mattingly's sacrifice fly  to left.  </P> <P> In the second inning, catcher Don Slaught drew a leadoff walk from Abbott,  followed, one out later, by a single to center by Alvaro Espinoza.  </P> <P> Abbott came back to strike out Roberto Kelly for the second out but walked  Henderson to load the bases. Sax then hit a sharp grounder down the third-base  line, which Howell failed to grab in a diving attempt.  </P> <P> Slaught scored on the play, giving New York a 2-0 lead that would become 5-0,  just as soon as Barfield and Brookens got in their third-inning swings.  </P> <P> "He wasn't as free and easy and relaxed as he has been," Rader said. "But  that's part of learning. You can't have it every night."  </P> <P> New York starter Richard Dotson turned that 5-0 lead into his first victory of  1989, lasting seven innings before giving way to relief pitcher Lee Guetterman.  Dotson (1-0) allowed two runs on six hits to set up Guetterman for his fifth  save.  </P> <P> The Angels managed but two hits in five innings against Dotson, who was making  his second start of the season after two relief appearances.  </P> <P> The only runs they could muster came in the sixth, following a leadoff single  by Dick Schofield. Brian Downing singled Schofield to second, and when Wally  Joyner forced Downing, Schofield advanced to third.  </P> <P> Schofield and Joyner eventually scored on a single to center by Devon White,  giving White 21 RBIs for the season.  </P> <P> Dotson completed the seventh inning before New York Manager Dallas Green called  on Guetterman, who worked the eighth and ninth innings for the save. In 16  appearance and 23 innings, Guetterman has yet to allow an earned run.  </P> <P> Dan Petry and Willie Fraser mopped up for the Angels. Petry pitched four  innings, surrendering only a fourth-inning walk to Sax. Fraser worked the last  two innings, walking two and hitting a batter.  </P> <P> "They really shut them down," Rader said, referring to his long-relief men.  "That was outstanding to see."  </P> <P> But it wasn't enough to offset the sight of those first three ugly innings.  </P> <P> Angel Notes  </P> <P> Claudell Washington rejoined the Angels Friday after spending 10 days in  Northern California to be with his daughter, Camille, who had to be  hospitalized after a home accident. "She's recovering, out of the hospital and  now in physical therapy," Angel Manager Doug Rader reported. Washington was  held out of the lineup Friday and, according to Rader, probably won't play  until Sunday. "You can't dump him in there right away," Rader said. "It's gonna  take him a little bit. He took a lot of extra hitting today and he'll do the  same thing (this) morning. Hopefully, he'll be ready by Sunday." Rader lamented  the fact that the layoff will may dull the swing of "probably our best hitter  at the time, but personal business comes first. No question about that. I'm  just glad everything's turning out good."  </P> <P> Third baseman Jack Howell had to be removed from Friday's game after a sharp  grounder off the bat of Steve Sax struck him in the left wrist. Initially, the  injury was diagnosed as a contusion of the left hand but X-rays were done in  the Angel clubhouse, which proved inconclusive. Howell is scheduled to have the  hand examined today by specialist Dr. Norman Zemel at Centinela Hospital in  Inglewood.  </P> <P> AN EXPERIENCED ASSISTANT  </P> <P> Mike Port hires Dan O'Brien to be senior vice president in charge of baseball  operations for the Angels.

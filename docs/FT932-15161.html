The airline, 70 per cent state-owned, said it had signed a letter of intent with Boeing and International Lease Finance Corporation to restructure the fleet based on the Boeing 767 long-haul and 737 short-haul families of aircraft. Discussions would be completed within three months after which Finnair would decide whether to proceed. Mr Antti Potila, president of Finnair, said the agreement was preliminary and non-binding and did not close the door to Airbus and McDonnell Douglas.</p>

"We are not going to leave our people without protection.  They have always lived in this area. We have no right to do  such a thing and nothing can force us to leave our people at the  mercy of fanatical Muslim units."    Mladic talked today to Generals Jean Cot and Michael Rose,  UNPROFOR commanders for the former Yugoslavia and  ex-Bosnia-Herzegovina. Vitaliy Churkin, Russia's deputy  minister for foreign affairs, attended part of this meeting.</p>

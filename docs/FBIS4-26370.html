			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 21 (XINHUA) -- Mutual respect for  sovereignty and mutual benefit are of even more prominent  significance in this post-Cold War era, when economic factors  are playing a greater role in the international arena.    This is the message of a signed article by the China Center  for International Studies carried in today's PEOPLE'S DAILY in  commemoration of the 40th anniversary of the proclamation of the  five principles.    It stresses that the five principles are still indispensable  in preserving world peace and promoting development in the  current multipolarized world, both politically and economically.    The five principles, namely mutual respect for territorial  integrity and sovereignty, mutual non-aggression,  non-interference in each other's internal affairs, equality and  mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence, were jointly initiated  by China, India and Myanmar [Burma] in late June 1954.    The world of today, featured by the dismembering of the  former Soviet Union and the relatively weakening of the United  States, provides an excellent opportunity and extensive base for  the implementation of the five principles, the article says. In  this aspect, the imposing of ideology by any one country on  another to the neglect of the sovereignty of independent states  can no longer work, the article notes.    The developed countries should provide more preferential  conditions for the developing countries in the forms of economic  aid, technical transfer and trade while thoroughly abandoning  the practice of attaching political conditions while doing so.  Thus, the principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and  territorial integrity and equality and mutual benefit are of  conspicuous significance nowadays, the article says.    Despite the end of the Cold War, the conflicts centering on  sovereignty have become even more prominent, as the western  countries are still trying to infringe on the sovereignty of the  Third World countries and interfere in their internal affairs by  advocating "human rights ahead of sovereignty" and "sovereignty  is outmoded". The fact is that while chanting "sovereignty is  out of date", some developed countries never bother to limit  their own sovereignty, but rather to set barriers to other  countries' efforts to protect their sovereignty.    Only by upholding the five principles, the principle of  non-interference in each other's internal affairs in particular,  can the third world countries maintain their independence and  develop their economies.    The five principles have so far been well accepted by the  world as the fundamental standards in handling not only  bilateral but also multilateral relations among countries, the  article says.    In conclusion, the article says that in the present  transition period from the old world pattern to a new one,  adherence to the five principles will help solve the issues  facing the world and establish a fair and reasonable new  international order.</p>

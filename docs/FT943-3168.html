			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Forte Air France's decision to sell Forte its Meridien stake was a welcome victory for minority shareholders. Whether it sets a precedent for other French companies is more doubtful. If Air France's board had picked Accor's lower bid, it would have been against the advice of the European Commission and Meridien's own management. Even so, it was a close call. As for Forte, this deal was strategically far more important than the Savoy imbroglio. Before Meridien, Forte only really fulfilled its slogan 'Host to the world' in the UK. It is now reinforcing its international presence with Meridien's 54 hotels in 34 countries. The deal also allows Forte to move upmarket without investing substantial sums in bricks and mortar. That reduces Forte's relative exposure to the property roller-coaster. Although the acquisition makes strategic sense, Forte could be criticised for overpaying. It would have been easy for the group to succumb to that temptation after being outbid for Ciga. The trouble for outsiders is that Meridien's inner workings remain obscure. Forte estimates the deal will dilute earnings by about 5 percentage points for the first year and be neutral after that. Nevertheless, the prospect of an eventual sale of its stake in Gardner Merchant means Forte can afford Meridien without recourse to a rights issue. If the deal allows Forte to escape from the international hoteliers' second division, the sum of Pounds 230m will be a small price to pay.</p>

			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (At a Glance): A rise in repossessions Home repossession orders issued by county courts in England and Wales increased by 35 per cent to 73,792 last year from 54,718 in 1990, according to the Council of Mortgage Lenders using figures issued by the Lord Chancellor's office this week. The figures do not include 'voluntary' repossessions as these do not need a court order. The Building Societies Association says it expects its figures, which cover the whole of the UK, to total 80,000 actual repossessions for 1991. However, there were signs of improvement in the last quarter of 1991 when orders made fell to 18,171 after a steady rise through the year to a peak of 20,218 in the third quarter.</p>

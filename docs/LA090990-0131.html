			<p><P> September 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PIG LOVERS GO HOG WILD OVER EXHIBIT AT FAIR  </P> <P> Most people who glance at Thummer, the official mascot of the Los Angeles  County Fair, see 600 blubbery pounds of pig panting atop a cool bed of sawdust.  </P> <P> But Billie Hart, the resident hog maven at the fair's "World of Pigmania"  exhibit, sees latex gloves, whipped cream, anti-freeze and ChapStick.  </P> <P> "If people only knew how much these noble creatures give us, they'd love them  even more," said Hart, a 72-year-old former nurse from Villa Park. "They're in  everything we touch. Isn't it marvelous?"  </P> <P> That may not have been the first thought on the minds of the tens of thousands  of people who flooded the Fairplex in Pomona on Saturday for the second day of  what has been billed as the world's largest county fair.  </P> <P> Until Sept. 30, Hart and the "Pigmania" pavilion will have to compete for  attention with a replica of the space shuttle Columbia, shooting galleries,  inflatable Teen-age Mutant Ninja Turtles and stomach-challenging rides such as  "Orbiter," "Kamikazi," "Gravitron" and "Quasar."  </P> <P> Even the livestock, often hailed as the heart and soul of the fair, is exotic.  There's a miniature horse, pygmy goats, wild Watusis, 8 1/2-foot-tall ostriches  and a team of racing armadillos.  </P> <P> But given a chance, Hart, a livestock consultant whose business card reads,  "There's More than Meats the Eye," can more than hold her own. Although she may  be something of a Dr. Strangelove to the animal-rights lobby, she says her  fascination with the by-products of four-legged creatures has only enhanced her  respect for them.  </P> <P> "You just know that they're going to be grazing forever on the beautiful green  grass that must be up there," she said with a nod to the heavens. "I really  feel God planned it that way."  </P> <P> Look for her seated under a small tent, just a couple yards from Thummer's pen,  behind an extraordinary spread of products -- apart from the obvious -- for  which pigs have given their all. There's a beer can, crayons, photographic  film, gum, an eraser, a cassette tape, air freshener, insulin and a heart valve  encased in plastic.  </P> <P> She might even pick up a baseball, courtesy of the California Angels, and  explain how the leather comes from cowhide, the stuffing from sheep wool, the  rubber core from the fatty tissue of livestock and the cork, although  originally from a tree, gets treated with their blood.  </P> <P> "People usually don't get squeamish when you tell them this," Hart said. "They  just don't know."  </P> <P> Not everyone at the "Pigmania" exhibit wanted to talk science.  </P> <P> "I love pigs, I really do," said Virginia Young, 66, who has a collection of  nearly 200 ceramic swine at her Torrance home. "And I don't eat them either.  They're so cute."  </P> <P> But as Thummer dug his huge snout into the sawdust, hoping to beat the heat,  Hart said being cuddly is only half his mission.  </P> <P> "If you're a pig, there's life after death," she said. "Long after they're  gone, they go on serving."  </P></p>

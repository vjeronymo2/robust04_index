			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / International Company News: Loral venture wins Dollars 400m deal SPACE Systems/Loral, the Californian joint venture between Loral of the US and four European aerospace companies, has won its biggest contract for more than a year, worth Dollars 400m, to build two direct broadcasting satellites. The deal is the first for the company in direct broadcasting satellites. It marks a breakthrough for Loral and its European partners, Aerospatiale of France, Deutsche Aerospace, and Italy's Alenia, in their efforts to challenge Hughes Aircraft and GE, the US companies which dominate the satellite construction business, The buyer of the two satellites is Tempo, a subsidiary of Tele-Communications (TCI), the Colorado-based company that is the world's largest cable television operator. The contract includes risk management and the launching of the satellites. The satellites will be delivered in orbit in June and October 1996 and will serve television viewers in the US. Their arrival in service will increase competition in the still young US direct broadcasting market, which is less developed than Europe's. The first direct broadcasting services in the US are scheduled to start next year with a Hughes satellite. Space Systems/Loral is 32.7 per cent-owned by Loral, 21.3 per cent by Lehman Brothers, the New York securities house, and 12.25 per cent by each of the European partners.</p>

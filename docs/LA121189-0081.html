			<p><P> December 11, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEMO: TREE FARMING  </P> <P> Only about 1.2 million Christmas trees are grown in California each year, which  represents about 25% of the statewide market for live trees, according to the  California Christmas Tree Growers, a trade group based in Alamo. Oregon and  Washington, by comparison, grow about 5 million trees each, and together supply  about 25% to 30% of the nation's trees.  </P> <P> The most common Christmas tree grown on California's choose-and-cut farms is  the Monterey Pine, a native of California's Monterey Peninsula, according to  the growers association. It isn't generally available on retail lots, according  to industry sources. It has a deep green color, needles four to five inches  long and a strong pine fragrance. Growers say it is a fast-growing tree that  takes four to five years to reach harvest size and is among the longest-lasting  trees when the stem is recut and the tree is kept in water.  </P> <P> The most popular tree found on retail lots is the plantation-grown Douglas fir.  Most sold in California come from the Pacific Northwest, but the tree also  grows in the colder, moister regions of Northern California.  </P> <P> The highest-priced tree found on California retail lots is the Silvertip or Red  fir, which grows only in high elevations and takes 12 or more years to reach  harvest size. The species is available on choose-and-cut farms in the Sierras.  </P> <P> The growers association projects an average tree price this season of $23.65,  or about the same as last season. Some choose-and-cut farms charge by the foot  -- in some cases about $5 per foot. Trees are available as tall as 12 feet.  </P> <P> In addition to pests, tree farms have to worry about thieves who sneak in a  night and help themselves. Federal officials have come up with a creative  deterrent to pilfering trees from public lands.  </P> <P> In some areas, trees have been sprayed with a compound that is odorless and  colorless, but produces a horrible smell hours after the tree is cut. It smells  "something like a reindeer that's been dead in the living room for a few  weeks," said an official interviewed recently on National Public Radio's  Morning Edition news program.

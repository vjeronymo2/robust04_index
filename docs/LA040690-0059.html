			<p><P> April 6, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEW;  </P> <P> COLLINS PERFORMS COLEMAN, TYNER  </P> <P> The music of Ornette Coleman and McCoy Tyner in the cool and elegant atmosphere  of the Westwood Marquis Hotel and Gardens? Well, yes, in a sense. Actually, it  was pianist and singer Joyce Collins playing the works of the two radical jazz  composers.  </P> <P> Even so, it was strikingly innovative programming, and a fascinating aspect of  Collins' Tuesday-evening performance. Working with bassist Bob Maize in one of  Los Angeles' most civilized listening spaces, the veteran pianist ranged across  the musical spectrum -- from Coleman and Tyner to Jerome Kern and bossa nova.  </P> <P> Collins, who spent six months coaching Beau Bridges for his part in "The  Fabulous Baker Boys," has been an under-recognized artist, and it's hard to  understand why she's been so overlooked.  </P> <P> Far from the kind of lounge performance that covers a quavering vibrato with  heavily-pedaled chords and shaky rhythms, Collins' work at the Westwood was  that of a first-rate modern-jazz instrumentalist who sings with the penetrating  insights of a cabaret artist.  </P> <P> On Coleman's "Turnaround," Tyner's "Inception" and a bossa nova original,  "Sweet Madness," she fashioned hard-swinging be-bop lines; on "Body and Soul,"  she somehow managed to uncover new lodes of harmony in a song that seemed mined  to the core. Switching to vocals, Collins applied her warm and husky contralto  to Kern's "In Love in Vain" and, most notably, to a stunning interpretation of  the rarely heard "Job Application" (from "Ballroom").  </P> <P> Maize, whose bass maintained a solid rhythmic foundation, also soloed with  soaring lines that countered Collins' brisk piano.  </P> <P> The Collins duo continues at the Westwood Marquis Hotel and Gardens through  Saturday and returns next Tuesday through Saturday, April 14.

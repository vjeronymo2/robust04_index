			<p><P> June 17, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOME IMPROVEMENT;  </P> <P> MAKE YOUR OWN BED WITH PLYWOOD SHEETS  </P> <P> If you were lucky, your mother taught you how to make your bed. If not, it was  your drill sergeant. Be that as it may, I'm going to teach you all over again.  </P> <P> But I'm not talking about hospital corners and bouncing quarters. I'm talking  about making a bed -- with wood, glue, screws and nails.  </P> <P> It's a very simple project, really -- little more than a simple plywood box  with the sleeping platform set down two inches into the frame. You can make it  in any size to fit any mattress. In fact, it's best to buy your mattress first,  then size the bed to fit. That's why I haven't supplied any dimensions in the  sketch.  </P> <P> Start by cutting out the sides and ends. Make them 20 inches high, unless you  prefer a bed higher or lower than normal. Cut the end pieces about an inch  longer than the width of your mattress, and make the sides about an inch longer  than the length of the mattress.  </P> <P> Material? Your best bet probably is birch plywood. It takes paint well, and  also looks good -- stained or unstained -- under a varnish finish. It's also  smoother and more uniform than ordinary fir plywood.  </P> <P> For the framework, use ordinary fir 2-by-3s. But sort through the pile to get  the straightest pieces you can find. Start the frame by cutting out four corner  posts, and two center posts, each 14 1/2inches long. Using 1 1/2-inch flat-head  screws and yellow glue, fasten these posts to the sides and ends. Drive the  screws through the plywood into the frame, countersinking the heads below  surface.  </P> <P> Note the corner detail in the sketch. The ends and sides do not overlap each  other. They join corner to corner, creating a pocket. Later you'll fill this  pocket with a quarter round molding, giving the bed nice soft corners.  </P> <P> After the corner posts are in place, glue and screw in the center posts. Center  these end to end on the side panels. Next, cut a center cross brace, the same  length as your end panels. Place this on edge atop the center posts and secure  it with a pair of screws, through the sides of the bed at each end.  </P> <P> Now finish off the framework, cutting the side and end rails to length, placing  one edge atop the posts and securing them with glue and screws.  </P> <P> You are now ready to cut and fit the sleeping platform. Unless you are making a  single bed, you will have to cut the platform out of two sheets of plywood,  running a seam directly over the center brace. You can use half-inch plywood  for a single bed, but for larger beds, three-quarter-inch plywood will produce  a stiffer surface.  </P> <P> Cut the platform about a quarter inch undersize. This makes it easier to fit  it. After the pieces are cut, lay them on top of the framework. Using a frame  square, check to make sure that the bed is dead square. If it isn't, you can  force it true without much effort.  </P> <P> Once it it square, fasten the platform down with several screws driven into the  frame. This will lock the bed rigidly in position and it won't be able to move  out of square.  </P> <P> Finishing up. Now you have to cover the top edges of the plywood. You can use  iron or glue-on wood tape for this, but I like to use half-round moldings. Cut  these the same length as your side and end panels and fasten them down using  yellow glue and small finishing nails. Then cut four pieces of  three-quarter-inch quarter round 20 1/2 inches long and glue and nail them into  the corners of the bed as shown in the detail. Using a rasp, finish off the top  ends of these quarter rounds so the blend in with the half-round moldings on  the side and end panels.  </P> <P> Fill over all screw and nail heads using wood dough or polyester auto body  filler. Let set, then sand and finish. Your best bet is probably three or four  coats of a good semi-gloss oil base enamel. Sand lightly between coats with  220-grit paper. If you want a natural finish, use a good alkyd or polyurethane  varnish instead of enamel. Stain before varnishing if you like.  </P></p>

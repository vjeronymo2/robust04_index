			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / Tax rule change shakes up Pep SAVE &amp; PROSPER, the fund management group, is being forced by a change in an Inland Revenue rule to write to between 800 and 1,000 unit holders, telling them they must restructure their personal equity plans by April 6 or face full taxation thereafter. The move, throwing into question up to Pounds 2m of investors' money, stems from a rule drafting error made by the Revenue in July and its subsequent, unprecedented, decision to rewrite the Pep rules retrospectively. The new rules, effective from April 6, will render any funds held in bond or gilt-based sums ineligible for Pep investment. Currently Pep holders can invest up to Pounds 1,500 in such so-called 'non-qualifying' funds. Most of the investors affected hold units in Save &amp; Prosper's Pep portfolio, launched in September last year, which exploited the loophole and combined Pep investments in equity and bond-based unit trusts for the first time. The decision to rewrite the rules was taken by Mr Stephen Dorrel, financial secretary to the Treasury, who said the use of bond and gilt-based funds by Pep's was not in the spirit of the original legislation. Mr Ken Emery, Save &amp; Prosper's technical director, called the Revenue's action 'vindictive' but said the company would comply. He added: 'The Inland Revenue has admitted that the mistake was theirs but have nevertheless introduced this change retrospectively. We have no choice but to write to unit holders advising them of the situation and recommending that they switch out of the Pep - we cannot move people automatically.'</p>

			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Fashion: Body talk, it's wiser to whisper - There is life beyond Lycra when it comes to sportswear. Christopher Brown illustrates some choices TO KEEP young and beautiful is an impossible dream. Staying fit and healthy is far more realistic. Most men know that getting fit is a noble ambition, yet remarkably few have the stamina to sustain the initial challenge. If you find it intimidating to choose a gym, or one of the many health and fitness centres now springing up, then deciding what to wear on your first visit is even more so. You probably did not notice what those perspiring bodies were actually wearing as you were being choreographed around carefully by a smiling member of staff. You might have had visions of Chippendale-like bodies - but most gym-goers could be described more truthfully as Biedermeier-like (over-stuffed, with wobbly legs). So do not worry too much about what your body looks like: after all, you have joined to improve it. And besides, gym clothing does not have to be made of tight Lycra. Do not, however, think that excavating an old rugby shirt or ancient pair of tennis shorts from your wardrobe will do. Gyms are about working up a sweat, but arriving in clothes that look as if they have been preserved in it will not improve your gym cred rating. Avoid the all-white look - you might be a gym virgin but do not advertise it. Besides, white has a tendency to make you look like an overgrown schoolboy on sports day as you sit, cross-legged, waiting for your first aerobics class. You will also soon discover that all those shiny neon colours are no longer popular. One item worth investing in is a pair of decent training shoes - cross trainers being ideal. The newly-redecorated Lillywhites at London's Piccadilly Circus boasts the largest selection, but the choice is overwhelming and slightly confusing. I found that Cobra, with its 42 shops across the UK, offered a more-than-comprehensive selection, with friendly and constructive advice. As a bonus, you could also pick up a pack of three sports socks for Pounds 3.99. With sports clothing increasingly making the cross-over to casual wear, the big 'trend' names are Champion, Russell Athletic and Nike. Champion now has a store in London's Oxford Street, but you do not need to shop along that venue of hell - there are other options. In the relative calm of Covent Garden's Floral Street, and Notting Hill Gate's Pembridge Road, can be found the two branches of Sports Locker, perhaps one of the best sportswear shops in London. In spite of its size, its carefully-chosen and co-ordinated stock would shame a larger store, selling not only the better-known names but also its own brand. If, however, you have a phobia about shops and shopping, then do not despair  -you can do it from home. The new Next mail order catalogue has four pages of NX sports wear (the grey cotton marl shorts are a bargain at Pounds 17.99). Then there is the SWEAT mail order catalogue which, like Sports Locker, offers the best of American and European gym wear. (There is also a shop close to the City of London, with staff who know what they are selling). Having bought your gear, you now need something in which to carry it. Most men seem to feel they need to get a Head bag, but Cobra is offering a medium-sized black bag carrying its logo for just Pounds 19.99. The Head bags are available in various sizes from the reasonable to the ridiculous - the larger ones are roomy enough for a cricket team, let alone one man's kit. As the gym virgin becomes experienced, his confidence grows and his girth decreases and he tends to cast aside the basic gym attire and becomes bolder  -greys are replaced by colour and there might come the time when he appears in a striped all-in-one. The etiquette of gym wear varies from club to club. In some, there is a preference for wearing the T-shirt outside the shorts; in others, it is de rigueur to tuck it in. Whatever you choose to wear, the main criterion is to feel comfortable - there is, after all, something to suit everyone's body.

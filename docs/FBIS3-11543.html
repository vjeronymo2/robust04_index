This was the ranking officer's response to  statements made by Brigade General Gonzalo Vargas Ortiz, chief  of planning and budget of the Defense Ministry, who, when asked  by the Finance Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, replied  that the FAN needed an overall budget because its military  capacity was collapsing, and this influences the country's  security. "That is one official's opinion, not the FAN's  opinion," Montero Reverte indicated.    The defense minister also made comments on a report  published  in a Caracas daily stating a group of officers are meeting to  discuss the country's problems and are being investigated by the  Directorate of Military Intelligence, DIM. The minister  indicated the Constitution, its Charter Law, and the will of all  the military ban politics within the FAN. When we enter the  military, we voluntarily sign a statement saying we do not want  to be politicians or decision makers. There is not going to be  politics in the garrisons," he added.    Commenting on the dismissal of charges against coupist  officers, he said that neither the Defense Ministry, the  Miraflores Palace, nor the military justice had stopped it. He  denied there is a state of alert from the fear of a Colombian  guerrilla invasion since the FAN has the plans and personnel,  including three task forces that operate on the border and  coordinate with the Colombian Army. He concluded by saying that  studies are being done along the border to increase guard posts,  and announced that the Army and the National Guard are building  10 posts.</p>

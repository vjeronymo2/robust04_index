The decision of the Tirana  court on March 30 was 12 years of imprisonment for Fatos Nano, 3  years for Sokrat Plaka and 1 year of imprisonment for Hasan  Hallko.    The first session of the Nano case in the court of appeal  was  held on May 24 and the prosecutor Petrit Duka asked that the  decision of the first instance be not changed for Fatos Nano  while the imprisonment term for two former officials Plaka and  Hallko be reduced.    Former socialist premier Fatos Nano, accused of  misappropriation of state property and falsification of official  documents, was first interrogated by the end of June 1993.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of statement by the General People's Committee for </F> Unity; place and date not given]    [Text] The realization of unity by fraternal Yemen and its  return to its original status as an united country had great  effects on all the sons of the Arab nation as an important event  in the modern history of the Arabs. This was emphasized by  Colonel Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi, the leader of the great al-Fatih  revolution, as soon as Yemeni unity was announced. He was aware  of the importance of the achievement and of the dangers which  threatened it from imperialist and reactionary forces, lying in  wait for the Arab nation.    The Great Jamahiriyah's General People's Committee for  Unity,  proceeding from the sacrosanct unionist ideals of the great  al-Fatih revolution and in consecration of the unionist longing  of the Libyan Arab people, announced in the document proclaiming  the people's authority, to continue the struggle until  comprehensive Arab unity is achieved and, in response to the  leading role of the leader of the great al-Fatih revolution and  his continuous drive to achieve Yemeni unity, reaffirms the need  for efforts to be exerted to stop the bloodletting and for  recourse to be had to wisdom and dialogue. Based upon unionist  legality and the pledge and concord document, efforts should be  made to save Yemeni unity, which should be valued as a pan-Arab  achievement that must not be abandoned.    The General People's Committee for Unity, proceeding from  its  pan-Arab commitments and in implementation of the basic people's  congresses' resolutions, reaffirms the following:    1. Efforts should be exerted to preserve the unity of Yemen,  which was the product of the will of the Arab people in Yemen,  as a historic achievement of the Arab nation's modern era.    2. The unity of Yemen and its historical borders should be  preserved as an inalienable geographical and historical unit,  which is an integral part of the pan-Arab entity.    3. An appeal should be made for an end to the fighting and  the resumption by brothers, in both Aden and Sanaa, of dialogue,  leading to an understanding based upon the terms of the  constitution of the unified state and the pledge and concord  document. All unionist people in fraternal Yemen shoud be urged  to work for such an aim in order to prevent imperialist and  reactionary forces -- the enemies of the Arab nation -- from  making capital out of this situation.    The General People's Committee for Unity, while urging the  above, calls upon all the sons of the Arab nation to exert  efforts in order to allow united Yemen to remain in its true  position in the movement of comprehensive confrontation, which  is being waged by the masses of the Arab nation against  imperialist schemes aimed at destroying the Arab nation,  plundering its resources, and undermining its sovereignty.</p>

			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / International Company News: Moody's lowers ratings of top Japanese brokers THE senior ratings of Japan's big four brokers were downgraded yesterday by Moody's Investors Service, the US ratings agency, which suggested their already weak earnings will be put under further pressure by planned financial deregulation. The four houses, Nomura Securities, Daiwa Securities, Nikko Securities and Yamaichi Securities, had senior debt ratings lowered, with Yamaichi falling from A3 to Baa2, due to Moody's belief that the company is likely to lose market share in coming years. None of the four brokers made a net profit in the first half to the end of September, though Daiwa broke even, and it, Nomura and Nikko reported small pre-tax profits. Yamaichi, the weakest of the leading brokers, reported a pre-tax loss of Y19.3bn (Dollars 155.5m), and a net loss of Y15.8bn, as stock turnover and prices continued a fall that began almost three years ago. Moody's said Nomura would 'remain the undisputed leader in the sector', but that even it was heavily dependent on brokerage commissions for revenue, and likely to suffer because of 'a secular change in the nature of stock trading activity in Japan. 'Future growth in the securities business, such as underwriting of straight bonds for Japanese companies, are likely to be arenas of tough competition with the entry of banks' securities subsidiaries, thereby reducing Nomura's market share,' Moody's said. Similar comments were made about the other three houses, which were also said to have 'a relatively inflexible cost base'. Moody's said the four houses 'may be required to help closely related securities companies', as smaller brokers, which have less diversified revenue sources, have been harder hit by the market's collapse. In announcing the downgradings, Moody's said the four leading companies had 'good liquidity and good capital', characteristics absent at some smaller houses, which reported particularly embarrassing losses in the first half and have announced restructuring programmes. Losses for most houses are likely to be larger for the full year to end-March as they deferred the write-off of mounting losses on their stock portfolios. However, some houses have already responded to criticism that they have failed to cut costs - Yamaichi plans to reduce management staff by 40 per cent - but even deeper cuts are likely in coming months. Moody's lowered the senior debt rating at Nomura and Nomura Bank International from A1 to Aa2, while Daiwa's rating was lowered from A3 to A1. Nikko's senior rating was downgraded from A3 to A2, and there were similar falls at a range of subsidiaries. The agency confirmed Nomura's Prime-1 rating for commercial paper.</p>

			<p><P> January 19, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: POMONA;  </P> <P> CITY VOTES TO SUE DISTRICT  </P> <P> The City Council voted this week to file suit against the Three Valleys  Municipal Water District, claiming that the district's board of directors  violated the intent of an agreement to expand the board from five to seven  members.  </P> <P> Councilman Mark Nymeyer, who made the motion to sue the water district, said  city officials had been led to believe that a Pomona resident would be elected  in June to represent the city along with current board member William Koch.  </P> <P> Instead, the board chose to have director Sandy Baldonado, a Claremont resident  who represents a portion of east Pomona, represent north Pomona until her term  expires in 1992. Because she would not be a resident of the newly drawn north  Pomona division, Baldonado could not run for reelection.  </P> <P> However, City Councilman C.L. (Clay) Bryant said he doubts that the city will  actually sue because the board expansion agreement requires aggrieved member  agencies of the water district to confer with the board before taking legal  action. "I think we're going to be able to work this out amicably," he said.  </P> <P> Attorney Janet Morningstar, who represented the city and two neighboring water  districts during the preparation of the agreement with the water district,  disagreed with Bryant's interpretation. The city is not required to meet with  the water board before filing a lawsuit, she said.  </P> <P> Morningstar said the agreement does not expressly guarantee that a Pomona  resident will be elected to the board in June.  </P></p>

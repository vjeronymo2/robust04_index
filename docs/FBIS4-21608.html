			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Vaclav Proks report: "Ukrainian Power Plants Need Skoda </F> Nuclear Engineering Products"]    [Text] The representatives of the Skoda Jaderne  strojirenstvi (Skoda Nuclear Engineering) company recently  signed a contract to deliver to Ukraine the first major shipment  worth more than 60 million korunas. The draft contract also  deals with the security of the payment. The product concerned  is compact containers for spent fuel pools at the Rivne nuclear  power plant. According to the company director, Vaclav  Lobovsky, Ukraine has expressed an interest in purchasing $150  million worth of nuclear equipment from Skoda Jaderne  strojirenstvi over the next five to eight years. Cooperation is  subject to the complex solution to the problem of payments.  According to Lobovsky, there is the possibility of barter --  the trade for Ukrainian electricity or perhaps some other goods.    "Ukraine is trying to reduce its undesirable dependence on  Russian monopoly suppliers, whose products allegedly are not of  as high quality as ours. Cost advantages are losing  attractiveness," Lobovsky claims.    Ukraine has the largest number of AVER 1000 [Water-Moderated  Water-Cooled Power Reactor] reactors (10 in operation and four  under construction). Only nuclear power plants are economically  capable of producing electric power in Ukraine. Skoda Jaderne  strojirenstvi introduced itself already in November by  successfully completing a one-year test run at the Ukrainian  power plant of its own modernized inching drive [krokovy pohon]  for the reactor, in which even the Russians expressed interest.    Ukraine is now beginning to replace its outdated control and  security systems. Ukrainian nuclear power plants are therefore  most interested in Skoda's inching drives including the  electronics, compact grids [kompaktni mrize], hermetic cable  bushing, and also maintenance inspections, which Skoda allegedly  offers at a price 10 times lower than Siemens, for instance.  Ukraine is also deciding now from whom to purchase spent fuel  containers. Skoda Jaderne strojirenstvi is not without chances.  So far, it has been producing them under a German license, but  as early as September it will introduce its own container  prototype, which could become, according to Lobovsky, the most  promising product of Skoda Plzen.</p>

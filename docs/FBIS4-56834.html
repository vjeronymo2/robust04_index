			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Excerpt" of news conference by Mireya Moscoso de Gruber, </F> presidential candidate for the Democratic Alliance, with  unidentified reporters at the Arnulfist Party headquarters in  Panama City -- recorded]    [Text] [Moscoso] I have called you to a news conference  today on behalf of the Democratic Alliance to publicly  congratulate Ernesto Perez Balladares on his victory in the  presidential elections. In addition, I want to publicly  recognize and congratulate the president of the Republic for  giving us peaceful, democratic elections, the likes of which we  have not seen in many years. We wish Ernesto Perez Balladares  and his new government team success.    [Reporter] What will the political future of the Arnulfist  Party [PA] and the Democratic Alliance be?    [Moscoso] We had a wonderful campaign with the Democratic  Alliance and have shown that opinion polls were completely  manipulated here. The figures we are seeing today, which  represent 90 percent of the votes, show that we are only 4  percent behind Perez Balladares and that we were the party in  second place, that we were always behind the PRD [Democratic  Revolutionary Party]. We will remain united. This alliance  will stay united. Of course we will have legislators in the  next Legislative Assembly, and the Democratic Alliance will work  together.    [Reporter] How does the PA view the future of our country  under a party like the PRD, which previously held the government  in our country?    [Moscoso] Of course the PA views the PRD with some concern  after the experience of previous years. Nevertheless, we hope  that Perez Balladares will be accompanied by the best men and  that he will govern for the people and not for a party.    [Reporter] Perez Balladares said he wants a government in  coalition with all parties and urged them to participate. Would  the PA be willing to participate in a PRD government?    [Moscoso] First we would have to receive that invitation  from Perez Balladares and then consult with the National  Directorate of my party. I cannot answer that question now.</p>

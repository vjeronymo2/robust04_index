			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Otmar Lahodynsky report: "No EU Military for a Long Time </F> Yet"]    [Text] Brussels -- "There will certainly be no European  defense structure before the year 2000. This process simply  takes time." In an interview with DIE PRESSE, Swedish Defense  Minister Andres Bjork explained that the European Union [EU] is  not yet prepared for a joint military policy.    The politician does not expect any decisions on military  cooperation to be made at the EU government conference planned  for 1996. "Every member country will have a veto right there."  However, the war in former Yugoslavia shows every day "that we  need a European security structure," the former secretary  general of the Council of Europe said.    Sweden will continue its nonaligned foreign policy also in  the European Union. Bjork rules out NATO membership for Sweden  over the long term; relations with the Western European Union  [WEU] will depend on the government conference in 1996.  However, Sweden is banking on cooperation with NATO and  therefore also participates in the Partnership for Peace [PFP].  "Sweden's neutrality policy will not be affected by it."    Bjork also expects useful information of the NATO  cooperation  program. For example, a talk on security in the Baltic area, in  which Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev also participated,  took place on the sidelines of the NATO meeting.    Bjork rejects a change of the treaty on conventional armed  forces, which was suggested by Grachev and would permit the  transfer of a large number of Russian troops and tanks in the  area of St. Petersburg. "This question is not to be dealt with  within the framework of the PFP, but in Vienna."    Bjork gave an evasive answer to the question of whether  Austria should not also accede to NATO's PFP after Sweden and  Finland. "The government in Vienna must decide this." He does  not see any problems because of the neutral status. "Sweden  will continue to stick to its independent defense. Since we  have not been attacked since 1894, it seems to be very  efficient." With an ironic undertone, Bjork added: "I always  use this argument to get more money for our army from the  Finance Ministry. Unfortunately, I am not always successful."</p>

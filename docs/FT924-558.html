			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / International Capital Markets: Japan plans new futures index to curb criticism JAPAN'S Ministry of Finance yesterday announced plans for a new stock futures index, in an effort to avert criticism over futures and options trading, in which foreign brokers are particularly active. Local criticism, that stock futures and options trading creates volatility in the underlying stock markets, prompted the ministry's move to review the Nikkei average of 225 leading stocks, which is a simple average of 225 stocks and does not take into consideration the number of shares outstanding. The ministry is now proposing a capitalisation weighted index, which takes into account the number of shares outstanding, to replace the Nikkei 225 futures index, which is seen as easily manipulated. The ministry is also considering rule changes and introduction of a 'circuit-breaker' system. Debate on the impact of derivatives trading has flushed out frictions between large and small brokers, Japanese and foreign houses, some of which have made large profits from derivatives, and between the Tokyo and Osaka stock exchanges - Osaka has a thriving futures market and Tokyo does not. Argument has focused on the composition and volatility of the Nikkei 225 index, which measures cash prices in Tokyo and is used as the basis for derivatives trading in Osaka and overseas exchanges, which list the Nikkei 225 futures. Some traders have tried to use the announcement as a marketing slogan, promoting shares which are under-represented by weight on the Nikkei 225 index. Ministry officials said stocks on the new index had not been decided. The introduction of the new index is likely to create friction between the Japanese and overseas exchanges, such as Singapore International Monetary Exchange, and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, for which the Nikkei 225 futures index is a lucrative product. Simex said futures trading of the Nikkei 225 futures index rose 395 per cent during the January to November period. However, Japanese officials said they would need to request overseas exchanges to switch to the new index. Since the market crashed in 1990, Japanese have blamed foreign brokers, the most adept in dealing in derivatives markets. Smaller Japanese houses, which lack the expertise or the capital to trade in derivatives, have indicated resentment towards the larger houses.</p>

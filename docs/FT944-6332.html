			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Arts: Why the simple, wise and touching works - Fringe theatre Some parts of Stairway to Heaven] are so good that one is tempted to say it is among the most promising, certainly the wittiest, new musicals for years. Other parts are so derivative of, and inferior to, Cole Porter that they can be dismissed as student pastiche. Still, it is astonishing start for Thomas Morgan and Kevin Metchear, whose first piece it is. The plot is plucked from a well-known movie which starred David Niven and Marius Goring. In the last week of the second world war a British airman bales out over the Channel without a parachute, having previously made radio contact with an American girl at the base. He should have died. Perhaps he did. The divine authorities had their eye off the ball and did not record the event. Thus he is stuck in limbo, torn between going to heaven or returning to earth with the girl. All sorts of jokes - legal, ecclesiastical, philosophical, Anglo-American - arise as the airman puts his case for going back to ground. There is a lot of Kafka in his trial. Morgan and Metchear have supplied the songs. If you like clever rhymes, here they come: mariage a quatre with Cleopatra, haikus with IQs, for examples. Best of all, and entirely in context, is 'running my department' with 'what Descartes meant'. Conductor 71, the role played in the movie by Marius Goring, here goes to Martin Connor who has a splendid French accent and terrific zest: a touch of Maurice Chevalier. The piece won this year's Vivien Ellis prize for new musicals. At the King's Head Dan Crawford directs. I have noticed before that he has a fondness for the period: for instance in putting on Sir Terence Rattigan's Flare Path. He also has a talent for putting a large cast on a small stage. Whether Stairway is transferable depends on finding a bigger theatre where the words, especially of the songs, would all come through. It is worth a try. Meanwhile the King's Head beckons. Besht Tellers is an itinerant Jewish company which made a marvellous London debut with Telling Tales in 1991. It was an anecdotal, episodic piece that combined pathos and wit and appeared to go down well in any language and any tradition. Before London there was a hugely successful tour of the former Soviet Union, playing in Russian. Since then the company has moved on, not automatically for the better. Far Above Rubies is so ethnocentric that one hesitates to recommend it to anyone without a knowledge of rabbinical law. This is the story of Bruriah, who was both the daughter and the wife of a rabbi. Male supremacy was the order of the day, whether in the bedroom or in the study. The rabbis made up the law as they went along. Bruriah stood up to them, putting new interpretations on the Old Testament. In so doing she may have been one of the world's first feminists: clearly the piece struck a chord with the audience at the Tricycle. The trouble is that Rubies is not much of a play. It is performed in a statuesque Greco-Roman-Egyptian style where actions seem scarcely to matter. One hopes that this is an aberration, not a deliberate retreat into introversion, especially since the original talents in Besht Tellers are still there. Rubies is written by Robbie Gringras who helped devise, and performed in, Telling Tales. Danny Scheinmann, the co-star in Telling Tales, appears again now. Rebecca Wolmann, a co-founder of the company, continues to direct and does so with great confidence: perhaps too much. Rubies was commissioned and funded by the British Arts Council. In a slightly disconcerting programme note Ms Wolmann writes: 'Had funds been available, I would have cast 50 women watching silently from the back of the stage'. Such ambitions can be dangerous. Telling Tales worked because it was simple, wise and touching: Rubies is none of those.</p>

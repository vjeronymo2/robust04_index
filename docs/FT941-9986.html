			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / Guy's role to be cut in London hospitals shake-up Guy's, the London teaching hospital that was the standard bearer of the government's market-based health reforms, will cease to provide everyday hospital services under a plan to reshape the capital's health services unveiled yesterday. The package announced by Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, included Pounds 85m to improve primary care in London. The Royal Marsden, the London cancer centre in Chelsea, and the Hospital for Sick Children, Great Ormond Street, will become trusts. Charing Cross and Hammersmith hospitals may merge on a single site. The announcement, the latest in a string of decisions aimed at reducing hospital capacity in the capital, will be a setback for Guy's supporters in the City of London. Guy's, which is just south of London Bridge, will not close altogether. Parts of the site, including an as-yet unopened Pounds 140m new wing, will be used for teaching and research. It will continue to provide local health services. But services such as cardiology and oncology will be transferred to its sister hospital St Thomas's, in Lambeth opposite the Houses of Parliament. The decision is a remarkable reversal of fortunes for one of the first hospitals to take advantage of the government's reforms when it became a trust hospital in 1991. Guy's was run by a management team that ministers regarded as enthusiastic supporters of their health reforms. The trust board responsible for both Guy's and St Thomas's had wanted to retain the two sites. But Mrs Bottomley decided that, while this would have represented some short-term savings in capital costs, it would have increased revenue costs in the longer-term. Some Guy's medical staff are threatening to resign over the decision and there are likely to be disputes about whether or not the government should return charitable funds that have been used to finance recent developments at the hospital. The Guy's announcement was part of a package on the restructuring of London health care. Following the recommendations of last year's Tomlinson report, ministers are transferring resources from hospitals to primary and community services. Mrs Bottomley said that, to help achieve this, Pounds 85m will be spent in 1994-95 on GPs' premises, new health centres and other forms of community-based care. The Royal Marsden would be given 'every opportunity to shape its own future responding to patient choice' as a trust hospital, Mrs Bottomley said.</p>

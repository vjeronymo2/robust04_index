			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Excerpts] With just a week to go before the holding of the  controversial constitutional conference in Nigeria, the  country's military ruler, General Sani Abacha, has been holding  talks today with traditional leaders. It is a followup to the  process started by his number two, Gen. Diya. They have been  trying to woo supporters away from the pro-democracy movement,  the National Democratic Coalition [Nadeco]. Nadeco is calling  for a sovereign national conference and for the installation of  Chief Abiola, presumed winner of last June's elections as  president. [passage omitted]    And it is not only the traditional rulers in Nigeria who are  divided over the country's political future. There's talk of  opposition to the government political program from within the  military as well. Gen. Muhammadu Buhari is a former Nigerian  head of state. On the line from Kaduna, Mustafa Ibrahim asked  Gen. Buhari if he thought Chief Abiola's action in declaring  himself president would split the Nigerian Army?    [Begin recording] [Buhari] No, I wouldn't. The Nigeria Army  knows that it will be the first institution to lose its job if  the federation breaks up. So, for their own personal security  they wouldn't allow Abiola's interest to jeopardize their career  and their country which they fought for.    [Ibrahim] It appears that the politicians are uniting. We  have heard recently that the National Assembly met in secret and  endorsed the presidency of Abiola, and asked the Army to quit.  It is looking increasingly likely that the Army is going to be  disgraced out of office if the politicians can mobilize  civilians on the streets. Is this not what is going to happen  now?    [Buhari] No, it is not going to happen, because we have to  look at the credibility of the politicians and that of the  soldiers in view of what happened during the last 10 years. I  don't think the politicians have got anything to show as far as  credibility and patriotism are concerned, relative to the  soldiers, of course.    [Ibrahim] But the record of the military -- of the eight  years of Babangida -- and the present regime is so poor and  dismal that people are tired.    [Buhari] Well, it would appear -- that is the personal  opinion of some Nigerians which I would not quarrel about -- but  if we were to make a relative comparison of corruption and  incompetence, the civilians have got nothing to show against the  soldiers.    [Ibrahim] Would you say the national conference, which is  going to take place later this month is the way out of the  political crisis in Nigeria?    [Buhari] I agree with that.    [Ibrahim] Why do you support the national conference?    [Buhari] Well, I supported it, because it is the most  sensible way out now. There seems to be an impasse, and the  best way is for Nigerians to go to the conference and then go  through the agenda as objectively as possible with the view of  keeping the Nigerians together and making a political progress.  That is why I support it.    [Ibrahim] But it appears this conference is going to be  teleguided by the government. It is not a free discussion.    [Buhari] No, I disagree. It cannot be teleguided. Look at  the type of people that are there, and in any case they have  been elected, and there would be some government representatives  there. I think the conference should be given a chance by all  those who want peace and political progress in Nigeria. [end  recording]</p>

			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / International Company News: Government joins US carmakers in research THE CLINTON administration yesterday joined the big three US carmakers in unveiling an ambitious public and private research initiative aimed at developing models three times more fuel-efficient than those currently produced. The joint 10-year project commits the government to sharing with Detroit technology, which originated with defence and space research. General Motors, Ford Motor and Chrysler, in turn, have agreed to co-operate with Washington, and one another, in adapting the technology to civilian uses, developing advanced manufacturing techniques, and producing prototype vehicles. The long-term goal is to make affordable cars that will travel three times as far on a gallon of fuel than at present. Among the technologies on offer by the government are strong, light-weight materials and electrical storage devices developed in the 1980s for the 'Star Wars' missile defence system. On the table from the space programme are advanced fuel cells, which produce electricity by combining oxygen and gas. An inter-agency task force will oversee the initiative, with the private-sector effort co-ordinated by the carmakers' existing research consortium, known as Uscar.</p>

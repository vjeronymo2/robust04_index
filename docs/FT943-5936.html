			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Waterglade talks to rebels Waterglade International, the lossmaking property developer, announced yesterday it was holding talks with rebel shareholders who have been seeking to oust the board. Mr David Cunningham, chairman, said the board was seeking 'an amicable solution' to the company's problems. The board overcame attempts by rebel shareholders to have it ousted by cancelling an EGM on August 18 on a technicality. The meeting had been called by rebel shareholders, led by Mr Winston Ng, to instal a new board which would include Mr Ng, Mr Anthony Midgen and Mr Selwyn Midgen. Mr Anthony Midgen said counter proposals made by the board last week had been rejected, but he hoped for a further meeting soon.</p>

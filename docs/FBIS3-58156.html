			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Bosnia `Invited' To Join NATO </F> Summit"]    [Text] Bosnia, where the situation of local population and  blue helmets is increasingly deteriorating (UN Protection Force  [UNPROFOR] military observers said that numerous civilians are  about to die of starvation in the region of Kakanj), will be the  last-minute "guest" of the upcoming NATO summit to be held on  10-11 January in Brussels. Besides, France called upon NATO to  send the warring factions a clear political message to stop  hostilities.    The issue of the former Yugoslavia will not be on the agenda  of the 16 NATO heads of state and government but will  nevertheless be raised by France, which hopes that NATO, and  also the United States, will strongly support the peace efforts  deployed, so far in vain, by the Europeans, indicated officials  wanting to preserve anonymity. Paris would like NATO to support  the peace plan elaborated by the Twelve in December.    The same officials say that the other topics on the summit  agenda, namely the U.S. Partnership for Peace proposal offered  to the ex-Soviet Bloc and the reinforcement of the European  defense strength, should be endorsed without difficulty by the  heads of state and government.    On the other hand, the discussion on Bosnia might be more  lively owing to persistent divergences of opinion among the  Allies. Furthermore, reliable sources say that Washington does  not want the Bosnian issue to overshadow its proposal to open up  NATO to East European countries, which in its opinion, remains  the priority issue of the summit.</p>

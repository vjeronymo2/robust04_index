			<p><P> July 12, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CROWDED FIELD BATTLING FOR BERTHS IN DISTRICT 20 PLAYOFF CONFIGURATION  </P> <P> Talk about calculator overload. There are more variables involved in trying to  sort out the District 20 playoff picture than there are in desk-top cold  fusion.  </P> <P> Entering the final week of regular-season play, only eight of the 19 teams in  the district have been mathematically eliminated from the playoffs, according  to Commissioner Mel Swerdling.  </P> <P> The top two teams in each of the three divisions qualify, along with two  wild-card teams. Woodland Hills West (18-3 in district play) and Newhall-Saugus  (16-3) have sewn up the Western and Northern titles, respectively, and  Lancaster (12-7) has clinched second in the Northern Division.  </P> <P> In the Eastern Division, Panorama City is in first place at 15-4, followed by  Sun Valley at 12-7. Gunning for second place or a wild-card berth are Glendale  and Burbank (both 10-8) and Van Nuys-Notre Dame (8-10).  </P> <P> In the Western Division, Woodland Hills East (11-7), Encino-Crespi (10-8) and  Reseda (10-9) could conceivably finish second or earn wild-card berths.  </P> <P> No such logjam exists in District 16 where Westlake-Agoura is 11-0 in district  play with six games remaining and can clinch the title this week. The District  16 regular-season champion and runner-up and the District 20 playoff winner  advance to the 6th Area playoffs, July 27-30 at Birmingham High. STEVE ELLING  </P></p>

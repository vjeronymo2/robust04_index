			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / UK Company News: In the right shape to float with ease - The approach which achieved a coherent whole Mr Dan Sullivan, chairman and architect of the modern-day Chamberlain Phipps, is unperturbed about the setback to his ambitions for the company's share price. 'We wanted to get the transaction completed and get back to business.' In his eyes, the setback is only temporary. US-born Mr Sullivan seems to have the experience to take a long-term view. He boasts a track record of more than 30 buy-ins and flotations, including Tyco Toys. From his strategic level, Chamberlain Phipps seems another success story: 'I look for companies that need something correcting other than just capital. Then I feel I can buy them at a reasonable price because they won't be as attractive to other people who aren't set up to work on the management issues, people who are looking merely to be financial investors.' Mr Sullivan came to Chamberlain in 1992, when its parent Evode had run into difficulties and was looking to make disposals. After having paid Pounds 88m for the then-quoted business in 1989, Evode sold the shoe components division to Mr Sullivan and Legal &amp; General Ventures for just Pounds 11.9m. Evode retained Chamberlain's adhesives and related businesses. The tasks facing the new owners were vast and Chamberlain Phipps' problems were long-standing. Founded in 1912, it had grown during the 1960s and '70s by ad hoc acquisition, with little attempt made to meld the divergent sites and businesses into a coherent whole. By the time Mr Sullivan came along, Chamberlain had drifted into some very costly activities. These included an unnecessarily large transport fleet of 40 juggernauts, single-skilled shopfloor workers and a centralised sales force touting almost 50 different product lines, with little emphasis on exporting and no targets set. In addition there were 15 different buying points in some areas of the group, hand-written sales ledgers and a centralised communications division. It was 'an administrative albatross,' according to Mr Jim Dale, Chamberlain Phipps' group financial director, who acted as Mr Sullivan's scout for management buy-in opportunities in the UK. The new owners set about creating what Mr Dale calls 'a more planned environment, in which people know what they are accountable for, not operating as before, in a reactive, day-to-day fashion.' Mr Garry Goodwin, managing director, puts it differently: 'We believed that if the managers already in place saw that they owned the problem, we had confidence they would help solve it.' The truck fleet has been reduced considerably and deliveries are now geared to customer needs, as well as the group's production schedules. The communications division was shorn of virtually all staff, computerised, and now contributes pre-tax annual profits of Pounds 100,000, against costs before acquisition of Pounds 600,000. Loss-making product lines were closed, and a decentralised sales force now has to deal with just 25 core lines. The workforce has shrunk by a net 20 per cent (to about 1,000 in total), with those remaining on the shop floor trained in three different skills. Each individual plant manager has also become a profit centre manager. The 'rag-bag' of 10 UK companies has been scaled down to three core divisions: components, polymers, and vinyls. Operating margins for the UK group have improved from 5.2 per cent pre-Sullivan to 8.4 per cent now. Productivity has increased by 10 per cent, and shopfloor pay packets are on average 10 per cent fatter. The company is also expanding internationally, via the recent acquisitions of French footwear companies. Mr Sullivan is planning more bolt-on purchases and is confident that he can do so without shareholders' help for at least a year or so. His strategy on acquisitions is unlikely to change. 'Companies with problems like Chamberlain Phipps don't respond to massaging of a consultancy nature,' says Mr Sullivan. 'They need to be refocused. It's not just about cutting costs, but re-orienting the company in the changed market-place in which it finds itself.'</p>

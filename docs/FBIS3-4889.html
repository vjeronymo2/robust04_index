Nouhak Phoumsavan, president of our  country, delivered a speech. He said: Laos and Mongolia are  situated in the same region. The peoples of the two countries  have maintained similar specific characteristics in terms of  customs, culture, and languages. The similarity in these  specific points has served as the basis for the establishment of  the long-standing, profound relations between the two countries.  Through the process of the said relations, the two peoples have  all along been friendly to each other. Noteworthy is that  leaders at various levels of our two countries have regularly  exchanged visits that have thus brought about mutual  understanding and firm friendship with each other.    This official friendship visit to Laos by your excellency is  considered a significant event in the relations between our two  countries in the new stage. It has created a new step of the  strengthening of friendship between the peoples of the two  countries. It has also resulted in further broadening the  cooperation between our two countries. I maintain that all  these have served the interest and aspirations of the Lao and  Mongolian peoples. They have also significantly contributed to  the common trend of the establishment and promotion of peace,  stability, friendship, and cooperation among the countries in  the region. As a friendly country, we have closely followed up  the steps of development of Mongolia. We are glad to see that  with the patriotic tradition, together with their  industriousness and persistence in engaging in labor, the  Mongolian people have successfully overcome the economic (?and  social) difficulties step by step. As a result, the material  and cultural life of the Mongolian people have been improved and  the situation in the country has now been stabilized. We believe  that with your excellency's efficient execution of the state  affairs, the potential in various fields will be exploited and  vigorously promoted and expanded, and Mongolia will then be  further developed and will prosper.    H.E. President Nouhak Phoumsavan continued:    [Begin Nouhak Phoumsavan recording] After the establishment  of the LPDR, our entire Lao people have positively implemented  the tasks of defending and building the country. We have now  carried out the renovation work in many fields. We have built  the new, market-oriented economy along with the broadening of  the relations and cooperation with foreign countries to draw  foreign investments. Simultaneously, we have paid attention to  gradually perfecting the political system to make it conform to  the renovation in other fields. Through this process, we see  that our country has basically achieved stability and  tranquillity while the people have maintained solidarity and  harmony. The people's rights of being owners of the country  have also been promoted and expanded as their living conditions  have been evidently improved. [words indistinct] our entire Lao  people have always wished to live in (?peace) and to be friends  with (?peoples of other countries). For this reason, the LPDR  Government has pursued and will consistently continue to pursue  the policy of building the country to achieve peace,  independence, friendship, and cooperation with various  countries, regardless of the differences in the political and  social systems on the basis of the five principles of peaceful  coexistence. We support the creative activities of Mongolia in  the international arena. We particularly support the  announcement on the turning of Mongolia into a nuclear-free  country, an act that has contributed to promoting and  establishing stability and security in the region and the rest  of the world. I would like to take this occasion to express  gratitude to the Mongolian people for the precious support and  assistance that they have rendered to our Lao people in the  recent past.    Ladies, gentlemen, and distinguished guests: Laos and  Mongolia have maintained a similar starting point in the  socioeconomic field. (?Presently), the two countries are  carrying out the restructuring [words indistinct] in accordance  with their respective specific points and conditions. Both  countries have wanted [words indistinct] through the  implementation of similar economic mechanism and policy of  broadening the relations with various countries. I am of the  view that Laos and Mongolia have maintained the potential to  increase cooperation in many fields in accordance with the  interest and [words indistinct] (?of the peoples of the two  countries). I am convinced that this visit to our country by  H.E. President Ochirbat (?will create a positive step for our  two countries) to promote, expand, and strengthen the friendly  relations. It will also bring about the broadening of the  cooperation between the two countries in accordance with the  aspirations and interests of the two peoples of Laos and  Mongolia. [end recording]    Later, H.E. President Punsalmaagiyn Ochirbat of Mongolia  delivered a reply speech. He said:    [Begin Ochirbat recording, in Mongol fading into Lao  translation] I am very pleased to note that our two countries  and two peoples of Mongolia and Laos have together promoted and  expanded the friendly relations since ancient times. The two  sides have always made efforts and cooperated in overcoming  various trials to enhance the said relations. I would like to  reiterate here that increasing development and strengthening of  the relations and cooperation between our two countries have  resulted from the spirit of mutual respect and support. In  recent years, [passage indistinct] though there was no  development in the relations between our two countries due to  (?the difficulties in switching to the market economy, which is  our common objective), following the trend of friendship and  cooperation that has covered the relations among various  countries in the region and other favorable factors, our two  countries have now maintained new conditions, and there is a  potential to enhance the cooperation along a new path and under  a new form. Besides, our two countries are situated in the same  continent and have shared many common specific points, such as  the states of being landlocked countries, having small  populations, and maintaining almost the same level of  development. With the efforts to fulfill similar objectives and  with the spirit of respecting each other, our two peoples are  marching forward along the same road on the friendly spirit of  helping each other and cooperating with each other.    I also reiterate here that Mongolia has respected and  attached importance to the traditional relations with the LPDR.  I pledge to strengthen, promote, and expand the said relations  to make them ever more prosperous on the basis of equality,  mutual benefit, and with new contents and forms. [passage  indistinct] The Mongolian government has always supported and  will continue to support the foreign policy of cherishing peace  and the efforts of the LPDR, which are aimed at turning  Southeast Asia into a region of peace, stability, and  cooperation. The Mongolian people are sincerely pleased to see  the Lao people, who have maintained a long history [words  indistinct], patriotic tradition, and heroic spirit of struggle,  have achieved success in implementing the policy of broadening  the economy in advance to the marketing system.

			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: US economy Yesterday's US economic data make gloomy reading, with the country apparently heading towards a third leg of the recession. The brightest spot was the 0.1 per cent fall in August personal expenditure. After allowing for distortions from Hurricane Andrew, that indicates a boost to the economy from consumer spending. However, consumers have been running down savings to pay for spending in recent months. They may not be able to keep that up: the data also showed personal income falling by 0.5 per cent. Not surprisingly, financial markets are looking towards a Federal Reserve rate cut after the release of September's employment report next Friday. Even if that happens it is difficult to see the economy turning up soon. Companies have little reason to invest when both presidential candidates are offering an investment tax credit next year. Consumers may now also defer spending until the election result is known. And while US goods are cheap in world markets, even after the recent rally of the dollar, slow growth around the world means poor export prospects. Wall Street may take some heart from third quarter results which show companies increasing earnings by cutting costs. Yet without a recovery, these savings may be viewed as a one-off gain, making current earnings multiples look too high.</p>

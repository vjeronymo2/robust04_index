A. Trakhtengerts, Institute of Control </F> Problems, Moscow; UDC 62-50:658.512]    [Abstract] This paper gives a general overview of the use  of computers in the design of multi-component systems. The  article begins by describing the concept of computerized  teleconferencing, where all participants see the same thing on  their screens and can act on it while communicating in real  time. It is noted that collaborations of researchers are no  longer limited by geography, and that international  collaborations are becoming more and more common. The problem of  evaluating the complexity of a task is discussed. Breaking down  a project into parts which can be worked on by different teams  speeds the design process, as does the use of expert systems.  Limits on the number of designers and workstations require  coordination of resources and efforts. A flow chart shows how  work can be organized. The process of limiting the number of  variants to examine and selecting the best variant is described  mathematically. Integration of components and selection of  optimal designs from the point of view of integrating them with  other components are addressed. Basic concepts involved in the  design and construction of a network for designers are outlined,  as well as the connection of separate networks with gateways or  by uniting them into one network. Multitasking and servers are  described. Figures 5; tables 4; references 6: 4 Russian, 2  Western.</p>

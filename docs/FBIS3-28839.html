			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "International Report" program] </F>   [Text] The people of Bougainville might be short of most  essential items, but they have an increasing number of radio  stations to listen to. The Wingti government is spending about  $75,000 [Australian dollars] of Bougainville restoration program  fund on setting up a government propaganda station, but as Sean  Dorney reports, the station might be illegal.    [Begin Dorney recording] Bougainvillians already have one  government-funded radio station to listen to -- Radio North  Solomons -- run by the National Broadcasting Commission, the  NBC, which has an independent charter somewhat similar to that  of the ABC. But Radio North Solomons, which had to abandon its  original facilities in Kieta in central Bougainville in 1990 and  operated out of Ribaul until shifting back to Buka Island about  a year ago, is apparently too independent for the Wingti  government.    This new radio station, which is to be called Radio  Bougainville, is going to be quite different to Radio North  Solomons, according to the Papua New Guinea [PNG] Government's  daily information release, BOUGAINVILLE TODAY. It says the new  station's objectives will differ from the NBC's station in that  it will enable the people to hear government news and, what it  calls, awareness programs. The station is to be located at  Loloho in central Bougainville -- not far from the areas of the  island still under the control of the BRA, the Bougainville  Revolutionary Army.    The BRA station, Radio Free Bougainville, has been a severe  irritant to the government for quite some time now. It  broadcasts rebel propaganda -- much of it wildly exaggerated  accounts of military encounters in which the BRA inevitably  killed the PNG troops, while its own men miraculously escaped  injury. However, it does have some good sources in areas  nominally back under PNG Government control, and occasionally  causes the PNG military some embarrassment by revealing details  of proposed military operations and even military briefings.    The idea of the government's station seems to be to counter  that rebel propaganda. Needless to say, the NBC is not too  happy about having a government-funded station competing with  its Radio North Solomons, and the NBC chairman is in a position,  at least on paper, to do something about it. Some years ago,  the chairman, Sir (Okon Tololo), was given sole authority to  approve or disapprove of any new radio station in PNG. He has  not given his approval to the new government propaganda station.  So, when it does go to air, unless the government provokes his  present authority over such matters, the government's station  won't be legal. [end recording]</p>

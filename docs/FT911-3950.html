			<p>910422 FT  22 APR 91 / GM to challenge Fiat in Poland GENERAL MOTORS of the US, the world's largest car maker, is set to challenge Fiat of Italy's leading role in the development of the Polish car industry. GM has completed a feasibility study into car assembly in Poland and is expected to begin negotiations with the government and with FSO, the Warsaw-based, state-owned car maker within a month. The US group, which controls more than 12 per cent of the western European car market through its Opel (Vauxhall in the UK) and Saab marques, is considering an investment of about Dollars 100m (Pounds 58m) to establish an assembly operation for 30,000-50,000 cars a year at part of the existing FSO facility. The operation would involve two or three shifts. GM, with Volkswagen and Fiat, has led moves by western car makers into eastern Europe. It is establishing a car plant at Eisenach, eastern Germany, and engine, small-volume car assembly and components operations in Hungary. The GM project will compete with a more far-reaching plan proposed by Fiat to reorganise the entire Polish car industry, including both state-owned manufacturers, FSO and FSM. The US group is understood to be considering assembly of both its Opel Kadett/Vauxhall Astra and Opel Vectra/Vauxhall Cavalier ranges in Warsaw. The project would be expected to attract automotive components suppliers to establish operations in Poland. The GM assembly plan would be aimed at replacing FSO's antiquated assembly operation of the FSO 125, an outdated Fiat design which stems from a 1965 licensing agreement with the Italian group. Production of the Polski Fiat 125 began in 1968. The Polish car industry has been based on licensed Fiat designs, with the production of the 125 and the Polonez hatchback at FSO in Warsaw and the Fiat 126 mini car at the FSM plant in Bielsko Biala, Silesia. Fiat is already firmly entrenched at the more modern FSM plant, which begins production later this year of a new generation small Fiat, the Cinquecento (500). About L1,000bn (Pounds 450m) has been invested for development and to modernise the FSM plant. Fiat's plan, put to the Polish government last year, to modernise and rationalise the Polish auto industry, included: Creation of a holding company encompassing the operations of FSM and FSO, the two state car makers, in which Fiat would take the role of 'strategic investor'. The building of engine and gearbox plants. A licensing agreement for the assembly of the Fiat Tipo at the FSO plant in Warsaw. It is understood that elements in the Polish government and FSO are keen to promote the talks with GM. The Polish car market totalled about 285,000 last year, and although sales are expected to fall to some 200,000 annually this year and next, GM forecasts sales of about 400,000 a year by 1999.

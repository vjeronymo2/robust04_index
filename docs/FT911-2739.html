			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / Tarmac proposes Pounds 200m development for Cardiff TARMAC has put forward a Pounds 200m scheme to South Glamorgan County Council for redeveloping a site linking the commercial and shopping centre of Cardiff with its docklands waterfront. The proposed project falls underthe urban development corporation set up four years ago to regenerate 2,700 acres of Cardiff Bay. The Bay project is the largest urban redevelopment being undertaken in Europe after London's Docklands. Mr Sam Pickstock, chairman of Tarmac Atlantic Wharf Developments, said in Cardiff yesterday the scheme would go ahead even if the proposed Pounds 125m barrage across the entrance to Cardiff Bay was not built. The private bill to promote the barrage, which is seen as crucial to the development, collapsed in parliament last week. The government has since said it will sponsor a new bill of its own to get the measure on the statute book. Mr Peter Mathias, director of Holder, Mathias, Alcock, the Cardiff architects which designed the scheme, said the centrepiece was a crescent based on London's Regent Street. Tarmac was the first developer to operate in Cardiff, arriving three years before the government set up an urban development corporation in 1987. It has spent more than Pounds 50m and committed another Pounds 25m on houses, commercial building and site clearance.</p>

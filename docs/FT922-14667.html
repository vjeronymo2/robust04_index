			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Election 1992: Football crazy - Ballot Box John Major is not interested only in First Division Chelsea. The prime minister is believed to be on the brink of offering help to the Third and Fourth Divisions in the football league. The clubs are under instructions from the Taylor report to introduce all-seater stadiums by August 1999, and some say they can't afford it. Major is sympathetic and is suggesting that Taylor should not be taken too literally among the lower orders. Roy Hattersley, a staunch supporter of First Division Sheffield Wednesday, was also offering help yesterday. This, of course, has nothing to do with the general election.</p>

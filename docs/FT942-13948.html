			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: 'Crazy' comparison with Manchester's debt Sir, In its pre-election desperation, the government is playing a new financial fiddle. So it is important for voters to recognise the tune. Government spokespeople, and their supporters in the popular national newspapers, have been declaring that such cities as Birmingham and Manchester have debts greater than some developing countries, the inference being that we have run up irresponsible 'bar bills' and must be called to account. What a crazy comparison to make, even for a government with an all-time record for financial incompetence. Many developing countries would love to have the assets of Britain's big cities and to be able to afford to invest in themselves. We are able to invest in our great cities because we create assets more valuable than the sums we pay for them and because we can afford to pay our debts - although this government, which seems to be trying to convert our cities into third-world economies, is making our task harder by forcing us to pay off debts in segments of one twenty-fifth instead of spreading them over the usual 60 years. The financial facts are that Manchester has a Pounds 1.28bn debt, but that this represents borrowing stretching back 60 years and essential to such functions as housing and education. Almost 64 per cent of our debt relates to the construction of nearly 90,000 homes to meet the demands of slum clearance and of home refurbishment work, while much of the remainder relates to Manchester Airport (we borrow on its behalf). This puts us in the same position as people who take out mortgages on property in the knowledge that they will gain something of value both during and after the loan period, which is sound investment theory. Manchester's gain has been housing stock which must be worth more than Pounds 4bn. Add the value of a large slice of Europe's fastest-growing airport, 18 secondary schools, 101 primary schools, parks, leisure centres, libraries and much other council-owned property and our debt fades into perspective. In the past, all governments have approved and praised our spending as vital to local welfare and progress. This wild attempt to switch it into the debit column comes ill from a government which this year alone will borrow Pounds 50bn, not to build assets for the nation but simply to pay off the deficit caused by its mismanagement of the economy. Graham Stringer, leader of the council, Town Hall, Manchester</p>

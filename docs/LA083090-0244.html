			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WASHINGTON DRIVER GETS EARFUL OF THE NEW 'CALIFORNIA ATTITUDE'  </P> <P> Washington natives who are vocal in their displeasure at the influx of  Californians had better be more discreet or else start thinking defensively.  Californians are fighting back.  </P> <P> A 31-year-old Seattle-area woman learned the hard way Tuesday when she yelled,  "Go back to California" at a Jeep with California license plates that had cut  her off.  </P> <P> The driver of the Jeep, a clean-cut guy about 35 wearing a tie, screeched to a  halt, roared backward, jumped out screaming obscenities and pummeled her small  truck, police said.  </P> <P> "I was so stunned that he would stop his vehicle and back up three car lengths,  then start using the 'f-word' and other names. I thought I was dead. He did a  beautiful karate kick to my truck," the woman said.  </P> <P> The man drove off after the woman dialed 911 on her car phone, she said.  </P> <P> "California is nice . . . but I really think he had a California attitude. I  guess I am biased toward them, especially after this.  </P> <P> "They ruined their own state and now they come up here and think they're going  to move us over with their rudeness and fast driving," she said.  </P></p>

			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Survey of Monaco (9): Healing waters of Monte Carlo - Thalassotherapy complex rises again In the grand old Edwardian era when the cream of European high society whiled away their summers in Monte Carlo, they spent each morning washing away their worries about the previous night's amorous adventures or gambling losses in the healing waters of the Sea Water Thermal Baths. The thermal baths were a Monegasque institution which opened in 1908 after Prince Albert I had noted the success of the sea baths at Roscoff in Brittany. They soon became a fashionable place where wealthy bathers could indulge in the ancient practice of thalassotherapy, a form of healing that exploits the soothing properties of exposure to warm water extracted from the sea. The original baths were destroyed by a stray German bomb which fell on Monte Carlo by accident at the beginning of the second world war. The debris was cleared and the old baths became the site of a swimming pool for the Hotel de Paris and Hotel Hermitage. That pool has now been closed while the Societe des Bains de Mer, the owner of the old thermal baths, builds a brand new FFr100m version. Monte Carlo's new seawater baths will posit on the same thalassotherapeutic principles as the original, whereby the body is exposed to sea water that has been pumped from a depth of 30 metres and heated to around 35 degrees. The temperature ensures that the microorganisms in the water, the phytoplankton and zooplankton, stay alive to secrete antibiotic bacteria and hormones with healing properties. But the new baths, due to open next June, will be much more sophisticated than the old ones. The new complex will include two sea water swimming pools together with seaweed cabins, sea water jet showers and a number of 'dry' treatment facilities such as massage rooms and a gymnasium. The complex has been designed by Dr Yves Treguer, one of France's leading cardiology specialists and the man behind the successful Thalassotherapy Centre at La Baule in western France. He hopes to appeal to both people with medical conditions and to 'lay' bathers who simply need a relaxing respite from their stressed-out lives. Societe des Bains de Mer, which has been struck by the recent revival of interest in thalassotherapy, hopes that its new Sea Water Thermal Baths will enable it to challenge the established centres at La Baule, Biarritz and Saint Malo: just as the old baths helped Monte Carlo to rival Roscoff in the early years of the century.</p>

			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / FT Guide For The Serious Investor (7): An ill-fit for the rich - Pensions, The earnings cap / The implications of the obstacle for high-flyers' retirement aspirations FIVE YEARS ago, the government decided it would limit the subsidies it would provide for the pensions of the truly wealthy. Lord Lawson, in his memoirs, records the outcry over the so-called earnings cap - second in volume perhaps only to that over the suggestion that pensioners should no longer be allowed to take a portion of their retirement benefits in a tax-free lump sum. But the policy has remained, and increasing numbers of highly paid individuals are having to seek alternative tax-beneficial ways to provide additional income in their retirement. The earnings cap was first set at Pounds 60,000 in 1989, meaning that an employee could save enough money to entitle him to a pension of up to Pounds 40,000. After much debate, it was decided that the cap would rise annually, but only in line with inflation as measured by the Retail Price Index. Because national average earnings rise by 2 to 2.5 percentage points a year faster than RPI, the industry calculated that, even those on relatively modest earnings, could find themselves up against the earnings cap at some point in the future. At that point they lose the tax advantages if they make any further pension provision. High-flyers, who, through rapid promotion, experience much larger pay rises, are likely to bump up against the cap even more quickly. Price Waterhouse estimates that a 40-year-old high-flying executive on the relatively modest salary of Pounds 28,200 will bump up against the earnings cap before reaching retirement age if his pay outstrips RPI by 4 percentage points a year. Things appeared even more ominous earlier this year, when the then chancellor, Norman Lamont, citing the UK's low inflation rate, said the earnings cap for the 1993-94 fiscal year would be frozen at Pounds 75,000, and would not be allowed to rise to Pounds 77,400 as had been planned. 'This is the thin end of the wedge,' said Mr Ron Amy, chairman of the National Association of Pension Funds and pension and benefits manager at Grand Metropolitan. The NAPF fears that the move will provide a precedent for future chancellors seeking to raise cash by taxing the well-off. But for all the anxiety, relatively few people have been affected so far. That is because the limit only applies to members of occupational schemes set up after March 14, 1989 or those people who joined existing schemes after June 1, 1989. 'The sort of people who have been affected are those who are high earners and who were recruited by head hunters to responsible positions since 1989,' said Geoffrey Calvert, tax consultant at Price Waterhouse. Employers who wished to attract and retain such people have had to figure out how to make a pensions promise that the individual will regard as iron-clad. 'The issue for the employee is one of security. They will want a funded promise,' Mr Calvert said. Because contributions attract no tax relief, anyone whose employer makes one on his behalf will be hit with a tax bill for 40 per cent of the sum. Rather than ask employees to take such a hit, some employers have been relying on unfunded promises - that is, promising to pay the pension out of current income when it falls due at some future date. Stewart Ritchie, director of pensions at Scottish Equitable, said that high-flyers can sometimes have their pension needs addressed by making modifications to the existing scheme. For instance, it is typical for employees to accrue 1/60th of their final pension entitlement for each year of employment. After 40 years of service, a full two-thirds pension is earned. But Inland Revenue limits allow schemes to grant as much as 1/30th of final pension accrual in each year. 'An individual earning Pounds 150,000 will be able to accrue as much pension entitlement each year in a 1/30th scheme as an individual earning Pounds 75,000 in a 1/60th scheme,' Mr Ritchie says. Thus, depending on how much previous pension benefit the high-flyer has accrued, employers may be able to find tax relief for pension contributions simply by setting up a new scheme with a faster annual accrual rate. Alternatively, the scheme may establish a separate section which accrues benefits more quickly. But for those who cannot take advantage of such a device, or those who are not satisfied with unfunded benefits, the pensions industry has been perfecting Furbs - the Funded Unapproved Retirement Benefit Scheme. Unlike unapproved company schemes, there are no limits on the level of pension benefits or lump-sum payments that can be provided. Furbs will never offer the tax advantages of pension arrangements before the earnings cap was set in place. But it can mitigate some of the more onerous tax consequences, while offering greater flexibility in the payment of pension benefits. 'You can retire at 45 if you want to,' Mr Ritchie said. According to Price Waterhouse, Furbs become attractive when contributions are likely to exceed Pounds 100,000 in total over the first two to three years of contributions. Furbs work like this: the high-flyer earns tax relief on pension contributions up to the ceiling under the earnings cap. The employer then makes the additional necessary contributions, which would attract a tax charge on the employee as a benefit-in-kind. But typically, the employer will pay the high-flyer's tax charge, treating it as a normal business expense for his own tax purposes. Furbs offer an additional advantage to employers, because contributions do not attract the National Insurance contribution, currently at 9.25 per cent of full pay. The NIC savings thus offsets some of the employer's pension expense. The funds are then usually invested in an onshore trust, which attracts tax at the basic-rate of 25 per cent on capital gains and 20 per cent on dividend income. Alternatively, funds may be invested in an offshore trust, which attracts no tax in certain cases. However, Mr Ritchie warns that the Inland Revenue may not allow the tax advantages of offshore investments to remain forever if it perceives that they are being widely exploited.  ------------------------------------------- When you may hit the cap before retirement  ------------------------------------------- The figures in the table show the level of current earnings above which an individual at the relevant current age can expect his or earnings, at age 65, to exceed the then level of the earnings cap, under two different economic assumptions.  -------------------------------------------                Increases in   Increases in                    earnings       earnings                exceed price   exceed price Current        inflation by   inflation by age              2 per cent     4 per cent  ------------------------------------------- 25                   34,000         15,700 30                   37,600         19,100 35                   41,500         23,200 40                   45,800         28,200 45                   50,500         34,300 50                   55,800         41,700 55                   61,600         50,700 60                   68,000         61,700  ------------------------------------------- Note: Increases in national average earnings have exceeded increases in the Retail Prices Index by almost 2.5 per cent a year over the 10-year period to December 1992, and by almost 2 per cent a year over the 20-year period to December 1992. For any individual, earnings increases following promotion etc have to be added - hence the illustration at 4 per cent a year  ------------------------------------------- Source: Price Waterhouse, August 1993  -------------------------------------------</p>

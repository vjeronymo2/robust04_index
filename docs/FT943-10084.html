			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / High pass marks for new solicitors spark fears Law firms yesterday expressed concern at the high exam marks awarded to trainee solicitors who have just completed the Law Society's controversial new exam course. The firms fear that the introduction of the course has diluted standards and failed to test students sufficiently. The College of Law, responsible for training about half of all trainee solicitors, released results of its legal practice course yesterday which showed that more than 85 per cent of the 3,339 entrants passed. The pass rate has been as low as 65 per cent. More than 80 per cent of those passing achieved a distinction or commendation. Only 497 students failed to pass and 66 per cent of those will be resitting just one paper in September. The new qualification - the legal practice course - replaced Law Society finals as the solicitors graduate entry qualification. It involves regular assessments, some based on video, and exams spread throughout the year. The old Law Society finals were based entirely on end-of-year exams. According to Mr Richard Holbrook, chairman of the College of Law's board of management, last year's first-time pass rate was 'in the low seventies'. The college said it was unable to give exact figures for last year's pass rates. Mr Trefor John, trainee partner at City law firm Stephenson Harwood, said: 'Generally there must be a concern that the qualification is being devalued.' He said his view was supported by the mixed reaction of trainees on the course, some of whom found its standards quite easy to reach. A partner in another City law firm said: 'We have just seen that most of our trainees have got distinctions, and I'm sure it's not because we have been lucky with our recruitment this year.' Mr Holbrook defended the results, saying that the main reason for the improved pass rate was the higher standard of candidate. Ms Anita Tovell, head of personnel at Lovell White Durrant, said it was too early to judge the new exam. Under the old system, passes could have been largely the result of good examination technique rather than a test of legal knowledge. 'It is too early to reach final conclusions,' she added. 'We will wait until our trainees come into the firm first and then see what benefit they have gained from the course.' Freshfields, the London law firm, said yesterday that it had been given permission to open an office in Hanoi.</p>

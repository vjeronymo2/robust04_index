			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / Banks may have to increase cash cover for market risks BANKS around the world which trade actively in the foreign exchange, securities and derivatives markets will have to set aside more capital to back their risks if proposals put forward yesterday are adopted. This amounts to the first significant extension of the so-called Basle Accord of 1988, which set common minimum capital levels for bank credit risk. The latest proposals, from the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision, would for the first time require banks to set aside capital to cover the market risks they run in their trading operations. They would also cover the fast-growing markets for derivative financial instruments such as futures, options and swaps. The impact of these changes would be lessened by a second Basle Committee proposal yesterday. This would reduce the amount of capital needed by banks, mainly in the swaps market. In a change planned to take effect early next year, the accord would be changed to recognise bilateral 'netting' agreements, under which two banks agree to set off their claims against each other and recognise only a net amount. Mr Gerald Corrigan, chairman of the New York Fed and of the Basle Committee, said the overall effect would 'work in the direction of a very modest overall increase' in the minimum 8 per cent capital requirement laid down in 1988. For most banks the rise would be 'not more than a percentage point'. Even this, though, would add greatly to some banks' capital costs. Mr David Haigh, managing director of finance at NatWest Markets, an arm of Britain's National Westminster, said a 1 per cent rise would require Pounds 700m extra at the bank. Mr Corrigan said the committee had not set out to restrict activity in particular financial markets, though he hoped the rules would force banks to adopt more cautious trading strategies, particularly in the foreign exchange market. The Basle Committee decided to publish its own proposals after talks on a common set of rules with international securities regulators collapsed earlier this year. Mr Corrigan said the Basle group would continue to seek agreement with securities regulators and the European Commission. The Basle rules are stricter than an EC directive on foreign exchange risk and position risk of banks in the equities markets. After consultation lasting to the end of this year, the proposals on market risk would not be produced until the middle of 1995.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by J.B.: "Truce Extended"] </F>   [Text] Two days ago in Knin representatives of the general  staff of the Serbian Krajina army signed the second consecutive  agreement to extend the Christmas truce.    The first extension of the truce, signed on 13 January 1994  at the Turanj border crossing near Karlovac, expired last  midnight. The second, newly signed extension is only a  continuation of the previously signed agreements, and it will be  in effect until the end of February.    This signing in Knin two days ago was mediated by UNPROFOR  representatives, as was the previous signing in Zagreb.    This latest agreement, according to the general staff of the  Serbian army of Krajina, provides for a cease-fire and readiness  to continue negotiations until a general cease-fire is achieved.    Armed clashes on the Knin front have significantly decreased  since 23 December of last year, when the Christmas truce took  effect. Croatian forces at the Benkovac-Zadar front did not  observe the cease-fire. Military clashes in this North Dalmatian  theater continued almost uninterrupted, but they are  considerably less intense than before.</p>

			<p><P> July 24, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HENDERSON'S HOMER IN 10TH BEATS ANGELS;  </P> <P> BASEBALL: OAKLAND, TRAILING 6-0 IN THE FIFTH INNING, COMES BACK TO RECORD A 7-6  VICTORY AND DROP CALIFORNIA 13 1/2 GAMES BACK.  </P> <P> The Angels' vital signs flickered perceptibly Monday night when Rickey  Henderson's home run with one out in the 10th inning capped a dramatic comeback  and gave the Oakland A's a 7-6 victory over the Angels at the Oakland Coliseum.  </P> <P> In the opener of a stretch Manager Doug Rader had termed "vitally important" to  his club's pennant hopes, the Angels built a 6-0 lead through 5 1/2 innings,  only to see it evaporate when their relief pitchers proved unable to stop the  late-charging A's.  </P> <P> A single by Mark McGwire and sacrifice fly by Troy Afenir closed the gap to 6-5  before Felix Jose tied it with a single to left with one out in the ninth.  </P> <P> Rickey Henderson slammed the game-winner off Cliff Young (0-1), the fourth  Angel pitcher, to improve Oakland's record against the Angels this season to  3-0 and stretch the A's lead over the Angels to 13 1/3 games. Oakland  maintained a three-game lead over the second-place Chicago White Sox.  </P> <P> The defeat was the Angels' first in a game they had led after seven innings.  They were 41-0 in previous games in which they were ahead that late.  </P> <P> Angel starter Kirk McCaskill yielded only one run in six innings but tired in  the sixth. Mike Fetters, Mark Eichhorn and Young were not up to the task of  preserving the lead.  </P> <P> An unearned run gave the Angels a jump in the first. Johnny Ray doubled into  the right-field corner and took third when Dave Stewart's first pitch to Max  Venable skipped past catcher Ron Hassey for a passed ball.  </P> <P> Venable walked, but Dave Winfield scored Ray with a single to right. Lee  Stevens had a chance to create havoc but grounded into a double play, leaving  him 0 for 12 since his first-inning home run Friday against Cleveland.  </P> <P> Station-to-station baseball produced another run for the Angels in the second.  </P> <P> Lance Parrish led off with a single to right, extending his hitting streak to  seven games. He went to second on Brian Downing's single to left and advanced  to third when Jack Howell walked.  </P> <P> Parrish scored on Donnie Hill's fly to medium left, brushing past Hassey  following a one-bounce throw from left fielder Rickey Henderson.  </P> <P> Singles in the fourth by Downing, Howell and Luis Polonia -- the last with two  out -- increased the Angels' lead to 3-0.  </P> <P> They continued to hit Stewart hard, adding two more runs in the fifth to pad  their lead to 5-0.  </P> <P> Venable opened the inning by beating out a chopper for an infield hit. He went  to third on Winfield's single to left but injured his shoulder or head while  sliding past third baseman Jamie Quirk.  </P> <P> He was fine after receiving attention from trainer Ned Bergert and got the  chance to rest on the bench after he was thrown out trying to score on  Parrish's grounder to short.  </P> <P> Winfield, who had moved to second on a passed ball, took third on Parrish's  grounder. Winfield and Parrish scored when Downing lined a double to  left-center for his third hit in three at-bats.  </P> <P> Joe Klink relieved Stewart before the sixth and ran into trouble when he  fumbled Polonia's chopper to the first-base side of the mound for an error.  </P> <P> Polonia stole second and took third on Hassey's high throw, which sailed into  center field. Polonia scored on Venable's single to right.  </P> <P> Hassey made some compensation for his error and two passed balls in the sixth  when he ended McCaskill's shutout bid.  </P> <P> Jose Canseco, hitless in two previous at-bats, led off with a walk and moved to  second on McGwire's groundout. Hassey then lined a single to right. Winfield's  throw reached Parrish on one bounce but Parrish could not hold onto it, and  Canseco was safe.  </P> <P> With McCaskill showing signs of weariness in the sixth in the form of two  walks, Mike Fetters was brought in for the seventh. He gave up a one-out single  to Rickey Henderson, who was forced at second by Dave Henderson, and was a  spectator when Jose Canseco crushed a one-and-0 pitch well over the 375-foot  sign in left-center.  </P> <P> The home run was Canseco's 29th of the season and seventh in 13 games since the  All-Star break.  </P> <P> Angel Notes  </P> <P> Angel television announcer Joe Torre expects the St. Louis Cardinals to decide  within a week whether they want him to be their next manager. Torre was  interviewed by General Manager Dal Maxvill last Wednesday, but Hal Lanier and  Don Baylor have also been interviewed. Lanier and Torre are considered the top  candidates.  </P> <P> "At first I wasn't sure (if he was interested), but the more I started thinking  about who I'd be working with, it gets you a little excited," said Torre, who  lost out on jobs with Minnesota, Pittsburgh, the Chicago Cubs and Houston after  his 1984 dismissal as manager of the Atlanta Braves. "I always find my way back  there, for Old Timers' games or whatever . . . I'm lucky. The situation here  makes it that much tougher if they want me."  </P> <P> Shortstop Dick Schofield was scratched from the lineup minutes before game time  because of soreness in his right shoulder, the result of his dive for ball  Sunday. Reliever Bryan Harvey was unavailable Sunday and Monday because of a  strained muscle which left him with a stiff neck. His status is day-to-day.  </P> <P> Despite the distance between the top teams in the AL West and the rest of the  pack, A's Manager Tony La Russa says the division is "probably more than a  two-team race. There's plenty of time for clubs to play their way into it."  Outfielder Luis Polonia said a sweep in Oakland was imperative if the Angels  are to be among them.  </P> <P> "This series means the whole thing for us," Polonia said. "If we don't beat  these guys right here, there's no more chance for us. There's no more time.  We've got to go out and do it."  </P> <P> A re-examination of infielder Mark McLemore's sore right thumb and wrist found  no new damage. He will continue therapy. . . . Bob McClure (sore left elbow)  will pitch a simulated game Friday. If all goes well, he will go out on  rehabilitation assignment.  </P></p>

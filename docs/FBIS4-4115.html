			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 27 KYODO -- China's paramount leader  Deng Xiaoping is in intensive care at a military hospital  following a sudden deterioration of health, a Seoul daily  reported Wednesday [27 April].    The SEGYE TIMES [SEGYE ILBO] in a dispatch from Beijing  quoted Western sources as saying that Deng, who will turn 90 in  August, has been hospitalized and is in critical condition.    The newspaper said in a front-page story that rumors are  circulating in Beijing about Deng's worsening health, and  possible death.    An official at the Foreign Ministry's [country not further  identified] Northeast Asia Bureau reached by phone dismissed the  report as totally groundless.</p>

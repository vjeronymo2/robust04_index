			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / The Birmingham Summit: Give treaty human face, says Major MR John Major urged his EC partners yesterday to give the Maastricht treaty a 'human face' to make it more acceptable to the citizens of the Community. The British prime minister said the aim of the summit was to put an end to the political and economic turbulence of the past few months, which had sown serious doubts in people's minds about future European integration. The rejection of the Maastricht treaty by the Danish people in last June's referendum and the close result in last month's French referendum indicated deep and widespread concern about the treaty. The recent turbulence on the foreign exchange markets had fuelled these worries. 'We must send a clear signal to the citizens of Europe that we will listen to their worries and respond to their needs,' Mr Major said. 'We have to convince them that the process of European construction is in the interests of all of us, despite the sacrifices it will sometimes require.' If the member governments failed to demonstrate to their citizens that their concerns were unfounded, then the Community must be prepared to change its ways and adapt to meet those concerns. 'Unless we have the people with us, our enterprise will not succeed.' Mr Major said that a clear declaration of political intent was required from the present meeting to reassure people that the Community would preserve national identities and the role of national parliaments, as well as becoming more democratic and open. Among the steps proposed to achieve these aims are closer consultation between the Commission and member states, encouraging national parliaments to become more involved in Community affairs and thus to act as a bridge between the Brussels bureaucracy and its citizens, and providing more information to the public about the Community's activities.</p>

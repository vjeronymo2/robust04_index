			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Arts: Banks head new spending - Sponsorship One of the major players in the extraordinary growth of arts sponsorship over the past decade retired last week: Geoff Shingles, who proved that sponsoring the arts could be good for business when, as chief executive of Digital, he persuaded his board in 1985 to rescue Sadler's Wells with a Pounds 150,000 investment. Shingles then put together Partners in Dance: dance was under-sponsored at the time and Digital could make a big impact with relatively little money. In the last nine years Digital has pumped Pounds 5.5m into the arts and reckons it has proved an excellent investment, enabling the company to entertain its 5,000 key customers, and more importantly, potential customers. Shingles later backed the National Theatre and the Tate and has given computer systems to leadings arts companies, but in recent months Digital has been forced to cut its spending from Pounds 500,000 a year to nearer Pounds 350,000 and The Digital Dance Awards were axed. But in the autumn Digital will review its position and, if profits are up, will probably raise its budget. * * * Profits have already improved for many companies, especially banks, which means that the 13 per cent fall in sponsorship last year could be quickly reversed. A few years ago NatWest was spending Pounds 1m a year; in 1993 it invested just Pounds 100,000, which basically went towards a prize aimed at art school students. But this year NatWest is spending Pounds 350,000, and all the signs are that in 1995 its budget will have grown again. The likelihood is that NatWest will choose to stick with the visual arts. Next week the bank announces the winner of its 1994 Art Prize. The winner receives Pounds 5,000 but NatWest also buys some of the short listed entries to add to its collection of contemporary art. Apart from the patronage (and investment) benefits from bolstering the visual arts it is a sponsorship area which suddenly looks sadly neglected. Two of the biggest sponsorships, the Barclay's Prize for graduates and BT's touring exhibition, New Contemporaries, are coming to an end. * * * In the next few months 50 or so managers of small businesses in Birmingham, Bristol and Cardiff will be invited to see a Welsh National Opera production. Putting them on the guest list will be KPMG, the management consultancy group, which is masterminding a networking service. The idea is that the businessmen will so enjoy themselves that they will form a local syndicate to provide funds, Pounds 1,000 each, or even less, to help finance the next WNO visit to their city, and in particular its community work there. This grass roots form of sponsorship is one of many initiatives anticipated from 'Go Opera', the new sponsorship package from KPMG. It is committing Pounds 550,000 over three years, distributed between WNO, Scottish Opera, Opera North and English National Opera. The money will back core activities, like new productions, starting with WNO's first ever Gilbert &amp; Sullivan, The Yeoman of the Guard, this Christmas, and followed by Britten's A Midsummer Night's Dream at the ENO in 1995. But it will also attempt to widen access to opera. At the WNO this will consist of creating community operas, workshops, and subsidised tickets; at Opera North cut price tickets for first time opera goers, workshops, discounts for regular attenders, and a new production; family tickets at Scottish Opera, plus a production; and help for the outreach Baylis programme through family days at ENO. * * * West Merchant, London based subsidiary of two German banks, is the latest financial institution to use the arts to drum up business. It is investing Pounds 100,000 a year to promote the arts of Latin America in the UK. West Merchant specialises in offering potential investors advice on Latin America and is also keen to work for rich South Americans living in Europe. Its first project is this month's Festival of Bahia in London. It has contributed Pounds 33,300 and as a first time sponsor has received a substantial Business Sponsorship Incentive Scheme back up award from the government. The final concert, at the Albert Hall on June 1, features four top Bahian singers and a samba band, and will be used to entertain clients who earlier attended a business seminar. Without the concert it is doubtful there would have been such a healthy response. In the autumn West Merchant promotes contemporary Argentinian art at the MoMA, Oxford.</p>

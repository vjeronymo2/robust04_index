			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / China attacks US as 'obstacle' to Gatt entry: Irritation over Washington's trade demands China renewed its trenchant attack on Washington at the weekend citing the US as the 'main obstacle' to its entry to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and accusing it of engaging in a 'political, economic and psychological game'. Mr Yu Peiwei of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation accused the US of using Gatt to 'pry open' China's financial, insurance, telecommunications, transport and other service markets for its own companies. 'Areas the US wants most from China are those in which American businesses have the strongest advantage, such as the car and aircraft industries as well as trade in services,' Mr Yu said in an interview with the official Business Weekly newspaper. Mr Yu's remarks, which are similar in tone to an increasingly irritable Chinese position on the US and Gatt, come on the eve of the resumption of Geneva talks between Chinese and American negotiators. The Chinese official claimed that US efforts to stall China's entry to Gatt were motivated by fear that a 'rapidly growing Chinese economy would enable China to join hands with developing countries to threaten the US dominant status in the world economy.' Beijing has been pressing hard to rejoin the Gatt and thus become a founder-member of its successor World Trade Organisation which is due to be inaugurated at the beginning 1995. But continuing argument over tariff reductions and market access issues is holding up China's application. US negotiators are pressing China hard to improve its offer of phased tariff reductions and market access to the agricultural, non-agricultural and services sectors. China argues that as a developing country it risks widespread economic disruption if it complies with US demands. In Geneva last week, Mr Long Yongtu, China's chief negotiator, set the end of this year as the deadline for 'substantive negotiations' on its Gatt entry. China withdrew from the trading accord in 1950, the year after the communists came to power. Mr Long said after talks with Mr Peter Sutherland, Gatt secretary general, that China would not make any new, substantive offers in negotiations on the Gatt protocol. China would also not 'on its own initiative' seek bilateral negotiations with Gatt contracting parties and meetings of the working party after the end-of-year deadline. The European Union, which has adopted a more conciliatory posture than the American 'hard line', has suggested that China be accorded 'founder-member' status of the WTO pending completion of negotiation of its protocol for entry.</p>

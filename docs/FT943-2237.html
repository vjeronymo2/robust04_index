			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / Leading Article: Agenda for Euro-reform Across a wide range of fields, the European Union is failing to win support from its citizens for measures carried out in their name and, ostensibly, for their benefit. Its decision-making bodies appear unwieldy, undemocratic and ineffective. Steps to correct this should be high on the agenda of the inter-governmental conference (IGC) which is to meet in 1996 to consider revision of the Maastricht treaty. That conference will also have to adjust the Union's institutions in the light of two years' experience with an enlarged membership (including Austria and up to three Nordic states) and in the perspective of further enlargement to central and eastern Europe. It will, in addition, have to take some account of Germany's desire for further advances towards political union as a condition for economic and monetary union. In considering reform, governments will need to separate areas where agreement is possible, and indeed indispensable, in 1996 from those where disagreement will remain for far longer. Some of the federalist proposals in the German Christian Democrats' recent discussion paper fall in the latter category. For instance, it is hard, if not impossible, to see how the proposal that the Commission should 'take on features of a European government' can be reconciled with the desire of several national governments (not only the British) to exercise more control over the Commission, through the Council of Ministers. One area where it is vital to agree on change is the size and composition of the Commission. Under present arrangements it will increase next year to 21 members, including at least one from every member state. There will not be enough portfolios to go round, plenary meetings will be hard to manage, and not all Commissioners will be of the calibre needed. The IGC will have to come up with a more meritocratic system, in which larger states forgo their automatic right to have two Commissioners each, and smaller ones agree to be represented in groups, or by rotation. If the Council, for the foreseeable future, is to remain the main locus of EU legislative power, changes in decision-making mechanisms will be vital to allow more majority voting, with a lower threshold for the so-called 'qualified majority', and voting weights that more accurately reflect the differing size of member states. The Council's legislative sessions must also be made fully public, and its work made more accountable, notably by better scrutiny in national parliaments. As for the European parliament, 1996 will probably not be the time to decide a further expansion in powers already considerably extended under Maastricht. The parliament must first demonstrate that, in spite of its disparate composition since last June's elections, it can sensibly deploy the 'co-decision' muscle it now shares with the Council. MEPs can help the electorate understand how the EU works, and what purpose they themselves serve, if they take a constructive rather than utopian or self-aggrandising lead in the debate on institutional reform. They could draft a European Basic Law - simpler and more modest than their predecessors' efforts at constitution-writing - which would relegate to essentially technical annexes much of the impenetrable language of the Maastricht treaty, and provide in its main text a clear account of the Union's structure, the competences of the various organs, and, perhaps most important, the division between the powers of individual member states and those of the EU. This draft could then be used as the basis for public debate throughout the Union, in which national governments would have to take a position. That way the citizens of the EU would be less likely to feel in 1996, as so many did at the time of Maastricht, that everything was being done behind their backs.</p>

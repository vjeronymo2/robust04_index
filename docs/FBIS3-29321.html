			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Soichiro Tahara: "`Pondering Ichiro Ozawa'"] </F>   [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] Lately excitement about Ozawa  has again begun to run high. Just what kind of person is Ichiro  Ozawa?    When the news and events of each day pass, I ponder over  Ichiro Ozawa, the strong man behind the coalition government.    The ASAHI SHIMBUN (morning edition) of 5 November [1993]  reported at the top of page one that "Kajima Made Regular  Donations of 5 Million Yen to Ozawa at Bon and Yearend  Festivals."    Moreover, the "Information Space J" program of TBS [Tokyo  Broadcasting System, Inc.] reported, with pictures of bundles of  banknotes, that during the last election, more than one  Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] candidate received campaign  funds of 20 million yen apart from the 5 million yen candidate  official-endorsement money. Furthermore, weekly magazines are  writing about "secret election measures" of Ozawa's election  saying, "A succession of `accusations' is flowing in from  contractors in `Ozawa's Kingdom,' Iwate Prefecture." There is  no other politician like Ichiro Ozawa on whom opinion is so  greatly divided. For that reason, he is a person around whom  myths grow and who plays upon one's imagination, whether one  likes it or not.    An executive of the Liberal Democratic Party, who was  formerly Ozawa's staunch friend, once commented that "Ozawa is a  rare kind of idealist." He also said, "That is Ozawa's defect."  A leading executive of Shinseito explains that "Ozawa is not  good at talking, and he is also not good at getting along with  people. He is a very awkward person."    Indeed, when one reads Ozawa's best seller, Blueprint  for Building a New Japan, one can glimpse "an awkward  idealist."  <H3>  Sweep Away the Gap Between Principles and the Opacity of  Politics </H3>   Ozawa emphasizes repeatedly in his book that Japanese lack  the principle of self-responsibility and that Japanese society  has developed into an irresponsible state of collusion and  mutual dependence.    He insists that political leadership should be firmly  established and advocates decentralization and abolition of  regulations.    None of these are novel. But his manner of speech is so very  earnest and intent that the ordinary content and commonplace  statements make one feel a certain wonder and even fear.    The characters for "leadership" and "determination," which  he  writes repeatedly, begin to appear to have the meaning  "forceful" and "acting arbitrarily on one's own authority."    Then, I recall a number of episodes which spawned "legends  of  forcefulness" concerning Ozawa.    One is the "dumping of Suzuki," who was the incumbent  governor, before the April 1991 election for governor of Tokyo.  Ozawa became notorious at one stroke as being a "young dictator"  who discarded in a high-handed manner the venerable, 80-year-old  governor who was brimming over with desire to do the job.    And there is the incident of summoning the three candidates  in the autumn 1991 election for LDP party president, Miyazawa,  Watanabe, and Mitsuzuka.    His bad reputation of being "conceited" or a "dictator"  increased still more because the young acting chairman, of all  things, summoned to his private office faction chairmen who were  older than him.    There is more. The incident of the 5 million yen donation  from Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin to Kanemaru in the autumn of 1992. The  criticism that Ozawa dealt with this arbitrarily without  consulting with the other executives of the Keiseikai [Takeshita  faction], and that he failed. There even appeared an Ozawa coup  d'etat theory to the effect that, actually, Ozawa tried to take  over the Keiseikai by plotting Kanemaru's downfall, and right  after that the Keiseikai broke up. Of course, when one gathers  information about the innermost workings of this kind of  "forceful" "arbitrariness," those close to Ozawa explain that  his tactless frankness is twisted and disorted and that legends  which depart greatly from Ozawa's intentions have taken on a  life of their own.    They say of the "dumping of Suzuki" incident that Governor  Suzuki, himself, stated that "a three-party setup of the LDP,  Komeito, and the Japan Democratic Socialist Party is a  precondition for running," and when the Komeito, on whom they  had depended, decided not to support him, Ozawa sought another  candidate, but later Suzukireversed his own statement. On the  incident of summoning the three candidates in the election for  party president, they say that when Ozawa first contacted  Watanabe's office and told him that he would go there, Ozawa was  told that "due to the circumstances of his schedule of  activities, Watanabe would go to meet him," and since it worked  out that way, the other candidates also arranged to come to  Ozawa's place.    They say, "tactless frankness".... But such things as the  suspicion concerning general contractors, the suspicion  concerning Sagawa Kyubin, and Ozawa's relationship with Rekiji  Kobari, who died on the 7th, cannot be explained by "tactless  frankness." If Ozawa has seriously decided to be a reformer, he  should first sweep away the suspicions that cling to him and the  opacity of the old politics. There is too great a gap between  them and the principles that Ozawa talks about.</p>

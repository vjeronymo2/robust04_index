Hirsch Ballin and Agriculture  Minister P. Bukman lower down the list of parliamentary  candidates than was proposed by the party committee. Economic  Affairs State Secretary Y. van Rooy now has the second place  after Brinkman, who is top of the list.    CDA circles blame Bukman's drop from sixth to eleventh place  on the problems encountered in convincing the rank and file of  the need to modify agriculture policies. "The change shows the  problems in farming and agriculture," a spokesman said.    In the run-up to the decision on the candidates, it was long  unclear whether the CDA Women's Council would succeed in placing  its "candidate," State Secretary Y. Van Rooy, in second place.  What could not be achieved at the party committee meeting in  November -- Van Rooy got third place there -- has now been  realized successfully.    Other female candidates in the first 20 positions, like M.  Soutendijk and A. Doelman-Pel, have climbed a few places as  well. F. Walters, tipped as a possible leader of the  parliamentary party, has dropped two places from five to seven.    State Secretary Heerma, who has criticized the style of  Brinkman, the leading candidate, has climbed three places and  now has the fifth position. The party spokesman pointed out  that the members had indicated their preferences before Heerma  expressed his criticism in the VRIJ NEDERLAND weekly magazine.  The leaking of the notorious letter from Bukman to Minister  Andriessen on agricultural tariffs also dates from after that  deadline.</p>

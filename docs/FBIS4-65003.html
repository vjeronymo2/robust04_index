			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Maria Romantschuk: "Rehn Not Excited About </F> Swedish Commander in Chief's Proposal"]    [Text] Defense Minister Elisabeth Rehn (RKP [Swedish  People's Party]) is not excited about the proposal for further  expanded defense cooperation in the Nordic region.    "This is a matter he has returned to several times," Rehn  commented yesterday. She is of the opinion that it has already  been extensively realized, since defense cooperation at all  levels in the Nordic countries is good.    Bengt Gustafsson, the Swedish commander in chief, who has  proposed Nordic defense cooperation before as well, thinks that  membership in the European Union [EU] opens up possibilities of  close cooperation between the defense forces of the Nordic  countries. He does not regard it as a problem that certain  Nordic countries are members of NATO. Gustafsson presented his  views in an interview with the newspaper HELSINGIN SANOMAT  yesterday.    The commander in chief says that cooperation could be  initiated with joint monitoring of the airspace and of the  Baltic Sea. He motivates his suggestion by the fact that if the  Nordic area is faced with a military threat of any kind, it  would apply to all the Nordic countries and not to any  individual country.    "I ask myself whether we are ready for joint monitoring of  this kind. That is actually the most basic defense in each  country, and those are among the most important functions that  each individual country wants to keep to itself," Rehn says.    Decisions of this kind would presume entirely new  evaluations  of the defense.  <H5>  Meeting With the Baltic Ministers </H5>   The already existing good cooperation is, in Rehn's opinion,  shown by the recurrent defense ministerial meetings, for  example, most recently over this past weekend, when the  ministers pondered Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia -- FYROM] and how to arrange the cooperation. At the  beginning of June the Nordic defense ministers and the Baltic  defense ministers will meet in Visby.    Rehn does not think that new institutions for defense  cooperation in the Nordic region are needed, not even in the  event Finland, Sweden, and Norway become members of the EU.    "What I am negative to is the idea of a direct union. No  institutions are necessary in order to practice cooperation."</p>

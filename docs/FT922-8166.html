			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Business leaders say Tecs on brink of collapse THE NATIONAL training structure is on a 'knife-edge' and may collapse unless the government gives greater freedom from Whitehall interference to the 1,000 business leaders responsible for running it. A confidential memorandum to Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary, from leaders of the 82 Training and Enterprise Councils warns that without 'major reform' the 1,000 senior executives running the Tecs 'will simply walk away'. 'There will be no mass protest,' says the memo from G10, the body which represents Tecs to government. 'But their effectiveness will drain away into the sand of inertia'. The Tec leaders are scathing about the extent of Whitehall bureaucracy and the absence of a clear cross-government approach to training. They say that Tec successes are now jeopardised by 'a welter of administrative procedures' and cite interference in their accounting and business methods from Department of Employment officials. They are particularly anxious to win more discretion in the way they manage the two main training programmes: Youth Training, which provides up to two years' training for 300,000 under 18s, and Employment Training, which provides up to one year's training for 149,000 long-term unemployed adults. Very few of these trainees currently go on to jobs. They doubt whether it is cost effective to retain the existing guarantees of a place on either ET or YT and claim it cannot be done without additional funding. The document continues: 'There is a conflict between the strategic focus of national targets . . . and the pressure of the guarantee for unemployed young people on the other. There must be proper public funding to meet this guarantee without seriously eroding the longer-term build up of national skill levels.' The issues of targets and flexibility will come to a head next week in talks between Tec leaders and Mrs Shephard. She may be ready to give some ground if it does not involve abandoning the training guarantees. Loosening these would be controversial and might raise headline unemployment. Today, the unemployment figure for April is expected to rise by about 25,000. Mr Tony Blair, Labour's employment spokesman, said more flexibility for Tecs might be desirable but 'it would be disgraceful if there were any reduction in help for the growing numbers of unemployed'. The Tec leaders want tax breaks for companies meeting the demanding Investors in People training standard. Only 50 companies have done so. They also want much greater Tec involvement in the careers service, currently run by local authorities.</p>

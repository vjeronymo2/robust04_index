			<p><P> October 26, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> RESIDENTS FEAR EYESORE, WANT TERMINAL TO RESEMBLE EARLY 1900S STATION  </P> <P> A group of Chatsworth residents told local officials Thursday night that they  want a planned commuter terminal to be a replica of the original,  turn-of-the-century Chatsworth Park train station that was torn down nearly 30  years ago.  </P> <P> Fearing that the bus and train transportation center being proposed could  become a graffiti-covered, stucco eyesore that would attract undesirables,  members of Citizens for Chatsworth unveiled their own plan for a wood-paneled  depot flanked by a shopping mall with western facades and a wooden boardwalk.  </P> <P> "We want something that will revitalize the community and revitalize the  heritage of Chatsworth," said Susan Amerikaner, one of the group's leaders. "We  have a lot of exciting history in Chatsworth."  </P> <P> Group members meeting with transit officials at Lawrence Junior High School  said the transit and retail center would commemorate the area's history as a  small ranching community of the 1800s.  </P> <P> It also would celebrate its popularity as a filming location for Western movies  in more recent years.  </P> <P> "We had both the real West and the Hollywood West here," Amerikaner said. "It's  amazing to me that there is nothing here to recognize that."  </P> <P> City and transportation officials have proposed building a transit center that  would be located in the heart of the Chatsworth commercial district on a  13-acre site that the county transportation agency has agreed to buy as part of  a $450- million property purchase from Southern Pacific Railroad.  </P> <P> Southern Pacific had planned to construct a lumber transfer station on the  long-vacant property, but its city building permits were revoked in September  after residents protested that the center would pose a traffic and safety  hazard.  </P> <P> Community leaders were initially thrilled when they learned of the planned  property sale, which is scheduled to be closed in six months.  </P> <P> But, they said, they now want to be sure that the transit center does not turn  into something worse than the lumberyard.  </P> <P> The original depot, built in the 1890s, was torn down in 1962 because of lack  of use.  </P> <P> About 70 Chatsworth residents attended the meeting, and when asked if they  supported plans to build a replica of the old depot almost all of them raised  their hands.  </P> <P> Chatsworth organizers believe that creating an attractive multiuse center that  would draw visitors day and night would discourage transients from  congregating.  </P> <P> Nikolas Patsaouras, president of the Rapid Transit District's board of  directors, told the citizens that county planners are willing to develop a plan  that they will be happy with.  </P> <P> He said "we will consider" the proposal to design the new station as a replica  of the original, built in the 1890s.  </P></p>

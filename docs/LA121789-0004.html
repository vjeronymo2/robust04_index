			<p><P> December 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> The Nov. 9 episode of "The Cosby Show" was one of the funniest shows I have  ever seen and is destined to become a classic. Obviously, Florence Burks and  Dorothy Dexter of Simi Valley (Viewers' Views, Dec. 3) have no sense of humor  or have totally missed the point. Cliff Huxtable is an obstetrician who sees  pregnant women all the time. Who else could empathize so well with the foibles  of pregnancy and childbirth? Lighten up, ladies.  </P> <P> Marlene Silver, Encino  </P></p>

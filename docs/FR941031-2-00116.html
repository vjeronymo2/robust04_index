			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FAA is committed to continuous improvement of its selection criteria. As the FAA gains experience with applying national priorities and BCA to airport projects, it will consider additional refinements of its selection criteria. These refinements may include: adjustment of the $10 million threshold value for BCA (perhaps establishing different thresholds dependent on type of project or airport size); application of BCA to discretionary projects other than capacity projects; publication of detailed guidance on appropriate BCA methodologies; and assignment of some or all BCA responsibilities to project sponsors (subject to FAA review). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA's effort to improve the effectiveness of its investments in the airport system will be reinforced by a new policy in which the FAA will apply BCA to LOI applications. The FAA will also estimate anticipated aggregate benefits and costs of AIP authorization requests beginning with FY 1996. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA will be responsive to concerns of Congress, State and local governments, airlines, airports, interest groups, and the public as it improves its selection criteria. To facilitate interaction with these groups, the FAA has initiated an outreach process to solicit advice from interested parties and experts in airport investment. At the FAA's request, the Research, Engineering, and Development Advisory Committee established a working group on selection criteria. The working group produced a report which was made available to the FAA in early 1994 and which influenced the development of this policy. Future outreach activities will include a conference under the auspices of the Transportation Research Board (scheduled for October 27, 1994); informal meetings between the FAA and interested parties; and systematic assessment of comments received by the FAA in the course of its administration of the revised selection process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Policy Regarding Revision of Selection Criteria for Discretionary Airport Improvement Program Grant Awards <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Introduction <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The process by which the FAA selects airport projects for Federal funding is defined in Order 5100.38A, ``Airport Improvement Program (AIP) Handbook.'' The following developments have contributed to the need to revise this process with respect to grants awarded at the discretion of the Secretary of Transportation: the need to improve the effectiveness of Federal airport infrastructure investments in light of an expected lack of growth in Federal AIP budgets; issuance of Executive Order 12893, ``Principles for Federal Infrastructure Investments'' (January 26, 1994); and guidance from Congress citing the need for economic investment criteria. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The following selection criteria for discretionary AIP grant awards comply with statutory requirements. They retain the basic processes of FAA Order 5100.38A while implementing new requirements designed to improve performance and effectiveness. The new criteria described in this policy apply to all new projects to be considered for AIP grant awards in FY 1995 and subsequent years. On a case-by-case basis, the FAA may apply the new criteria to ongoing projects approved for AIP grant awards in prior years. As appropriate, the FAA will make additional adjustments to the selection process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Preliminary Project Selection Screen <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Projects must conform to several basic eligibility requirements before they will be considered for AIP funding. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.1&blank;A sponsor of a public use airport is eligible to apply for AIP grants if the airport meets at least one of the criteria for inclusion in the National Plan of Integrated Airport systems (NPIAS). These criteria are specified in Order 5090.3B, ``Field Formulation of the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems (NPIAS)'' (September 9, 1985), and are summarized as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.1.1&blank;The airport enplanes (or is forecast to enplane within 10 years) 2,500 or more revenue passengers per year and receives scheduled passenger service; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.1.2&blank;The airport handles at least 25,000 itinerant operations, or 35,000 local operations, of general aviation aircraft per year and relieves a congested airport with at least 250,000 annual enplaned passengers; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.1.3&blank;The airport has (or is forecast to have within 5 years) at least 10 based aircraft, is publicly owned, and is located 30 minutes or more (average ground travel time) from the nearest alternative airport eligible for AIP funds (special conditions apply to heliports); <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.1.4&blank;The airport serves as a scheduled mail stop of an air carrier transporting mail pursuant to a contract with the U.S. Postal Service; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.1.5&blank;The airport serves as a permanent base for the Air National Guard or a reserve component of the U.S. Armed Forces; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.1.6&blank;The airport meets a significant national interest (established by special written justification or by a benefit-cost analysis). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.2&blank;Airport sponsors must also satisfy statutory and administrative application and grant condition requirements, including environmental review, public hearings where applicable, airport layout plan and airspace approval, and financial capability. Proposed airport projects should be supported by comprehensive master planning studies. A full exposition of these and other requirements is provided in Chapter 3, ``Project Eligibility, Allowable Costs, and Donations,'' of Order 5100.38A. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

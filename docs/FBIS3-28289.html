			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 7 February Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] In relation to the structural reform of the  insurance industry, the Ministry of Finance [MOF] has decided to  institute a "public hearing system" to hear the views of private  companies. This measure is being taken in response to U.S.  demands in the insurance sector negotiations at the Japan-U.S.  economic framework talks to promote more transparency in  government administration. This proposal will be presented at  the bilateral negotiations to be held in Washington on 7  February as a compromise plan.    While MOF will work further on the details of the public  hearing system, concrete measures being considered include  allowing a certain period of time for insurance companies to  submit written suggestions on insurance structural reform to the  MOF, and giving foreign insurance companies the opportunity to  attend deliberations at the Insurance Council, and to state  their views.    At the framework talks, the U.S. Government has been  demanding since last fall more transparency in the process of  structural reform. At first, the United States had demanded  that structural reform should proceed simultaneously with  bilateral negotiations but has recently softened its position to  demanding opportunities for private insurance companies,  including foreign insurers, to state their views before the  structural reform plan is formally decided upon.    The U.S. Government is apprehensive that the MOF may proceed  with structural reform while coordinating with Japanese  insurance companies, thereby excluding foreign companies'  participation. Furthermore, in the United States, structural  reform is always accompanied by free airing of views from the  private sector after the draft plan is announced. In some  cases, opinions of the private sector are incorporated into the  final plan. Such difference in administrative procedures is one  reason why the United States seeks a public hearing system  similar to its own.    MOF is in the process of reforming the insurance system,  with  particular emphasis on amending the Insurance Law. It plans to  present the draft amendments to the regular Diet session in  1995. Among the reform measures being considered are:  liberalizing the third sector insurance -- such as insurance  for injuries, illnesses and nursing services -- where both life  and non-life insurance companies participate, and introducing a  brokerage system, where brokers recommend the most advantageous  insurance policies for the clients. U.S. insurance companies  have also shown great interest in the outcome of the reform plan.</p>

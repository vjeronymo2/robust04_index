			<p>BFN     [Text] After the Serbs based in Bosnia launched a sudden  attack on the wider area of Zupanja in the Republic of Croatia  with nine destructive shells at 1125 this morning, a general  alert was sounded in Zupanja. Around midday Slavonski Samac  also came under attack. According to a report from the Croatian  border police, the Bosnian Serbs fired around 15 fragmentation  shells on Slavonski Samac. There have been no casualties in  these attacks, but huge material damage was caused.    In another Serb attack on the area of Orasje and Samac [in  Bosnia] several civilians were wounded and fresh material damage  was caused. The Serbs attacked that area with  surface-to-surface missiles that they fired exclusively on  civilian targets and business facilities.</p>

			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / Survey of New Zealand (4): Thoughtful calm follows the upheaval - Politics, there will be no more first-past-the post parliamentary elections. Nikki Tait considers the implications Winds of change are blowing through New Zealand politics. The question is: what sort of landscape will remain when they have died down? The upheavals began on November 6, when voters not only went to the polls in a general election, but were also asked, via a separate referendum, to choose an electoral system to be used in future elections. Both results were surprising. The 1993 election returned a hung parliament - at least, until a recount in marginal seats resolved the issue, giving the ruling National party a one-seat majority (turned into a two-seat majority when a Labour MP agreed to act as Speaker). More fundamentally, however, voters threw out NZ's British-style 'first-past-the-post' method of electing members to its single-chamber parliament. Instead, the electorate delivered a clear vote in favour of a 'mixed member proportional' system, a form of proportional representation which has parallels with certain European electoral arrangements. Under MMP, the current 99 seats in the NZ parliament will be enlarged to about 120, but only half of these will be occupied by members representing specific constituencies. Instead, voters will have two votes - one for their constituency MP, and one of their preferred political party. The results of the latter vote will determine how many seats each party has in parliament, with the necessary number of MPs being drafted in from the party lists to ensure that each party's overall parliamentary tally corresponds to this decision. The vote for MMP was essentially a protest. New Zealand has undergone a decade of profound, and often painful, economic reform at the hands of both its major political parties. The Labour government began the process in the mid-1980s, deregulating financial markets and privatising or corporatising government-owned businesses. National, which swept to power in 1990, continued the process, freeing up labour markets and making major changes to the welfare system. Going into last November's election, then, many voters saw little to distinguish the policies promulgated by the two parties, and blamed both for the less palatable aspects of the reform process, such as high unemployment, a rising crime rate, visable evidence of poverty on city streets. By choosing MMP, they endorsed a system which seemed more likely to give minor parties a meaningful voice in parliament and encourage coalition government. For example, the Alliance party, a coalition of left-leaning minor parties, could reasonably expect about 20 seats if it simply repeated its 1993 election performance. It attracted more than 18 per cent of the popular vote, but, under the old FPP system, secured only two parliamentary seats. But while a decision has been made as to what type of electoral system New Zealand will use in future, the practical implications - such as the redrawing of constituency boundaries and the drafting of party lists - are taking longer to sort out. As a result, New Zealand's political scene is strangely becalmed. Both Labour and National conducted internal personnel changes in the wake of the last election. In Labour's case, the changes started at the top with the ousting of Mike Moore as party leader, while National shed its hardline finance minister, Ruth Richardson. But since then, while rumours of coalition possibilities and new parties abound, no one seems anxious to rock the boat too violently until a fresh election under the new rules is technically feasible. The few MMP-related matters resolved to date have rarely escaped controversy. In late-April, for example, the re-registration of Maori voters was completed, but the outcome was to lift the number of Maori seats from four to just five. This contrasted with some expectations of up to 11 seats. Protests from Maori leaders, who claimed that the process had been under-publicised, followed, as did calls for alternative means of achieving more meaningful representation. Ideas range from a Maori parliament or Maori upper house, to the formation of a separate 'Aotearoa' party (the Maori name for New Zealand). The question of how individual parties go about drawing up their lists is less advanced, and none of the main parties has yet settled on a final method of ranking names. But already two are displaying different approaches to the thorny question of whether they should attempt to persuade MPs who will lose their constituencies under MMP to remain within the party fold. Mr Bolger, prime minister and leader of the National party, earlier this year took the bold step of publicly acknowledging that some defections were likely. 'What we are seeing is an inevitable consequence of the role of MMP. . . There are fewer electorate seats available, and the MPs of the two major parties are going to see whether or not there is somewhere else they could find a position of some sort,' he said. 'What we want is. . . their loyalty in terms of any coalition understanding or any accommodation that they will vote with the government on key issues.' The wisdom of this statement has been much debated: some observers see it as a canny acceptance of the inevitable, and believe that, by allowing defections, Mr Bolger will ease his list problems and yet retain some loyalty when the time for forming coalitions comes around. Others argue that National is adding grist to the minor parties' mill. Mr Bolger's stance contrasts with that of Labour's Helen Clark, who appears more intent on retaining members within the party fold. The repercussions of the MMP vote, meanwhile, do not provide the easiest background against which to govern - and in general Mr Bolger's National party has been taking an unprovocative, some might say conciliatory, tack. It is true that much of the reform process was already complete on going into the 1993 election, with most of the major privatisations complete, and thorny subjects such as industrial relations law in place. But National has become somewhat more responsive to voter concerns - introducing a minimum youth wage, for example, and setting up a taskforce to look at the unemployment issue. Controversial further potential privatisations, like NZ Electricity and NZ Post, are also off the agenda. One remaining bone of contention is the Employment Contracts Act (ECA), the legislation which effectively deregulated the labour market. When the current parliamentary session began last month, Labour, the Alliance and Mr Winston Peters' New Zealand First were all proposing changes - with Labour suggesting that a new employment council should draw up a replacement for the act, and that the ECA be repealed by 1995. However, the government was sticking to its guns, insisting that, if the matter was pushed to a confidence vote, it would win. Many in the business community clearly hope that New Zealanders' rebellion peaked on November 6, and that, after a couple of years of solid economic growth, the electorate's disquiet will have ebbed. Whether the National party government survives that long is the key question. It is widely accepted that the mechanisms required to hold an MMP election will not be in place before next April or May. Mr Bolger has also indicated that he will seek to govern for the full three-year term, if members of his own party permit him to do so. But some observers suspect that a showdown, in the form of a vote of confidence, is inevitable before then. 'The hot money,' suggests one Wellington-based economist, 'is on August 1995'. By then, it is argued, the MMP processes will be in place, and MPs, anxious to maximise personal positions, will have started to defect from the major parties. Why wait?</p>

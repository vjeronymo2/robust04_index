			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Mercury wins first round of action against Oftel Mercury, the UK tele-communications company, yesterday won the preliminary court hearing of its action against BT, its principal competitor, and Oftel, the telecommunications regulator. It is the first legal action to be pursued against a regulator of the former state utilities. Mercury claimed that Oftel had not offered it reasonable terms for the carriage of its traffic by BT, through a consistent misinterpretation of BT's government licence. Mercury, which has about 10 per cent of the UK telecom market, uses BT's network to deliver most calls made by its subscribers to their final destination. At present it pays BT on a per minute basis using BT's charge bands. Mercury's victory yesterday means there will be a full hearing of its application for a legal interpretation of that part of the licence which deals with interconnection. Mr Mike Harris, Mercury's chief executive, said he would be asking the court to hear the case as soon as possible: 'Mercury's case is simple. All we want is to obtain an independent interpretation of the correct basis on which the director-general of Oftel must now set interconnect charges payable by Mercury to BT.' Otherwise, he said, the entire industry would continue to take risky investment decisions while waiting for a decision. 'If interconnect charges were set on the basis of actual costs, Mercury would be free to offer customers innovative prices and pricing packages,' he said.</p>

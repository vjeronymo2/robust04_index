			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Luiz Orlando Carneiro] </F>   [Text] Brasilia -- The Brazilian Government has accepted  the Argentine Foreign Ministry's apologies, which alleged that  President Carlos Menem had not been informed about the candidacy  of Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero when he endorsed the  candidacy of Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari for  chairman of the World Trade Organization, which will replace  GATT. Menem announced his support for Salinas at the Fourth  Ibero-American Summit held in Cartagena, Colombia.    In a letter received by Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso  Amorim this past weekend, Argentine Foreign Minister Guido Di  Tella states that his government is willing to review its  support for the Mexican candidate.    The two foreign ministries are interested in minimizing the  diplomatic incident to avoid further consequences. This past  weekend, President Menem sent his condolences to President  Franco for the death of his nephew and private secretary Ariosto  during the Cartagena summit.    According to Itamaraty sources, President Itamar Franco's  premature return to Brazil because of the death of his nephew,  and the disclosure immediately afterward by President Menem of  his support for the candidacy of Carlos Salinas de Gortari,  created such a big problem in the bilateral relations between  the two countries that Foreign Minister Celso Amorim allegedly  discussed with President Franco the possibility of recalling  Brazilian Ambassador to Buenos Aires Marcos Azambuja "for  consultations." In diplomatic language, this means a temporary  suspension of relations between the two countries.    The Brazilian Government has decided to accept the  explanation that it was all a misunderstanding after Di Tella  summoned Azambuja on 17 June to tell him, among other things,  the following:     -  President Menem was not informed (by the  Argentine foreign minister) that Rubens Ricupero's candidacy for  WTO chairman was of great interest to Brazil;    -  The Argentine  delegation in Cartagena thought that President Franco had  discussed the issue with the Mexican president. As the  Brazilian delegation left the summit soon after the death of  Ariosto Franco, without leaving any recommendation, President  Menem accepted the pressure from Mexico and decided to publicly  express support for Salinas.     According to Itamaraty sources, the Argentine Government  wants to use the opportunity of the Mercosur [Common Market of  the South] summit that will probably take place on 15 July in  Buenos Aires "to put a definite end" to this "misunderstanding."    Meanwhile, Brazil expects Argentina to inform the  governments  of Colombia (which hosted the Ibero-American summit) and of  Mexico that Argentina had not intended to "reject" [desapoiar]  the candidacy of Ricupero as WTO chairman.</p>

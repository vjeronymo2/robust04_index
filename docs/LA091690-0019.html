			<p><P> September 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IT'S OPEN FOR CLOSE INSPECTION  </P> <P> How to get there: The Foreign Legion museum is Aubagne's singular attraction,  so signs pointing the way to it abound.  </P> <P> The main gate is on D44A. Continue beyond the gate to the first street that  comes in from the left. Turn onto it (the motor pool will be on your left) and  proceed to the entrance to the museum. Parking and admission are free. When to  go: From October to June, the museum is open Wednesdays and weekends, 9 a.m. to  noon. John E. Frook  </P></p>

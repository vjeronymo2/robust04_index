			<p>BFN     [Text] Santo Domingo, 8 Jun (EFE) -- The Dominican  Revolutionary Party (PRD) proposed several measures today to  resolve the crisis triggered by the 16 May elections, which the  PRD maintains were fraudulent, to the Central Electoral Board  (JCE).    The PRD's measures range from holding new elections, in  which  all political parties will participate, to holding elections at  the most conflicting voting tables.    PRD leader Jose Francisco Pena Gomez requested an honest  count of void and contested (embargoed) votes and an explanation  of the evident inclusion of voters from the ruling Social  Christian Reformist Party (PRSC), which is affiliated with the  "Santo Domingo Accord" Alliance. These voters allegedly voted  with only their personal identification and electoral numbers.    He also recommended determining the difference between the  number of voters included on the voting lists delivered to the  political parties and the number of voters included on those  lists delivered to the electoral tables by the JCE and to  investigate the alleged exclusion of voters.    Pena suggested that independent, national, and foreign  technicians advise the JCE on computer operations and that  civilian society and Catholic Church personalities help in the  count. The PRD leader urged Electoral Tribunal judges "to  reestablish the original resolve of the Dominican people."    The leader of the PRD and "Santo Domingo Accord" Alliance  maintained that other ways to respect the people's resolve  "while reestablishing the only truth that emerged from the 16  May elections" could include holding new elections with the  participation of all political parties.    Pena said complementary elections could be held where it is  proven a large number of voters could not cast their votes. He  added, however, "the PRSC personal identification card factory  will have to be closed" in order to meet this goal.    He accentuated his allegation of fraud during the 16 May  elections, thereby noting the country is facing an "electoral  coup d'etat" to curtail the Dominican people's right to freely  elect their rulers.    The Dominican Republic has immersed itself in endless  arguments and accusations of fraud, which are keeping the  country bogged in economic uncertainty and a suspension of such  productive activities as tourism and free zones.</p>

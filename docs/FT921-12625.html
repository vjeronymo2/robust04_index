			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: DTI move knocks Steetley A DECISION by the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) to refer the proposed Steetley and Tarmac joint venture to the EC, and ultimately the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, sent shares in the two builders tumbling. The venture would create a company with around 13 per cent of the brick market and is seen by many observers as a necessary move in an overcrowded sector. Steetley lost 37 to 369p in heavy volume of 5m, while Tarmac slipped 5 to 118p with 4.4m traded. Many analysts said the DTI move would spell the end of Redland's bid for Steetley, which if successful would create a group with a 26 per cent share of the brick market. However, Redland would probably make a fresh bid should the MMC rule in favour of the joint-venture. Redland fell 5 to 465p. Mr Terry Murray at James Capel said: 'This is bad news for Tarmac and Steetley. They both wanted to get their brick business sorted out. Without this joint-venture, some parts may have to be closed down.' Tesco switch Supermarket group Tesco was up on a securities house recommendation and a bullish presentation. The shares firmed 7 1/2 to 240 1/2 p. Panmure Gordon changed its recommendation to a buy from a sell after a visit to the company on Thursday, and switched its stance on the sector to overweight from neutral. Analyst Mr Michael Bourke cited falling capital expenditure projections as the main reason for the change. Observers said the shares were also helped by a positive presentation to institutions by J Sainsbury after the market closed on Thursday. Analysts said the presentation covered the whole sector, and as Tesco is the cheaper of the quality stocks it was the first to benefit. Sainsbury held firm at 356p. Lonrho falls International trading group Lonrho opened steeply lower yesterday after marketmakers slashed their prices on consideration of the company's results, announced after the market closed on Thursday. When trading began the shares were quoted at 108p, down 55 on the previous day's close. They saw furious turnover at that level with investors bailing in response to the much lower-than-expected annual profits, a dividend cut and others seizing a buying opportunity. By the end of the day they had recovered to close 43 off at 120p with 32m traded, the highest turnover since September 1989. The shares quoted in South Africa also fell sharply and Lonrho was the most actively dealt stock in the traded options market. The recent uptick in British Airways was sharply reversed, after Kleinwort Benson told clients to 'top-slice' the stock which, they said, had run too far too quickly. Airways ended the session 7 lower at 244p on keen turnover of 3.5m. There were also hints of a possible downgrade from one of the influential US investment houses. Guardian Royal Exchange dipped 3 to 123p, after Smith New Court recommended selling the shares in its recent analysis of the insurance composites sector. Fears of a dividend cut and the weak state of the company's general and life operations continue to hit the share price in a generally depressed sector, ahead of the final figures in March. Banking shares showed mixed changes in the run up to next month's results from the big four clearing banks. Barclays fell 1 to 381p and Midland lost 4 to 221p, but Lloyds gained 4 to 398p while National Westminster rose 2 to 286p. Panmure Gordon's analysis of the banking sector tends to agree with the recent review from Shearson Lehman Brothers, suggesting that NatWest is the most attractive buy among the major UK banks. This reflects fading fears that NatWest will cut its dividend, despite the fact that it may be uncovered on the latest profits forecast. Brewer Bass fell 7 to 1081p in response to a downgrade from Smith New Court. The house cut the estimate for this year by Pounds 37m to Pounds 560m. The move followed news at the Bass annual meeting on Thursday that there had been a deterioration in its trading mix and that reorganisation costs would be higher than expected. Northern Foods rose 14 to 551p on slim turnover after securities house County NatWest recommended a switch out of Ranks Hovis McDougall. Ranks recovered 3 to 218p after falling 14 on Thursday in response to a company profit warning, saying current trading, particularly in the bread industry and in the US, continues to be very difficult. County cut its forecast on Ranks for the year to August 1992 by Pounds 31m to Pounds 113. A securities house forecast cut hit Tate &amp; Lyle and prompted the shares to tumble 12 to 418p. Mr Carl Short of Nomura cut his estimate for this year by Pounds 9m to 245m and for next year by Pounds 13m to Pounds 275m. The figures are at the lower end of analysts' forecasts. He has also adopted a more bearish stance and is now advising clients to take profits. A cut in the dividend forecast for BAe sent the shares tumbling underlining their volatile reputation. They also suffered after reflection on Thursday's speculation over the possibility of a bidder emerging before the general election. Broker UBS Phillips &amp; Drew slashed its dividend forecast by half to 12p, analyst Mr Paul Compton worrying about the level of debt and the absence of a finance director among other things. The shares fell 15 to 283p. Lack of news on the possibility of Vickers sale of its Rolls-Royce subsidiary took 3 off Vickers at 178p. Rolls fell 3 to 136p. Ramifications of Vickers losing the Type 23 frigate order left the ship-yards owner 23 off at 408p. Lonrho's statement on weak platinum prices hit Johnson Matthey, down 10 at 335p. A forecast downgrade by Charterhouse left BAA 15 off at 541p in moderate turnover of 1.6m. The size of the fall perplexed some analysts as the Charterhouse move - slicing Pounds 20m off its current-year forecast to Pounds 200m - simply brought it into line with other brokers. Another heavy day's trading in Queens Moat saw 5.8m shares traded as a succession of recent buy notes improved sentiment over the stock. The shares faded to close a half-penny stronger at 78p. Holiday group Airtours continued strong on the news of its buoyant holiday bookings, adding 12 to 915p. Owners Abroad, however, was hit by profit-taking and fell 1 1/2 to 105 1/2 p. Two cash calls left the market cold. Hi-Tec lost 3 to 179p after it Pounds 10.3m rights issue, while Wembley slipped 3 1/2 to 33 1/2 p after its Pounds 37.3m call. City Site's results were in line with market expectations but the dividend cut was not and the shares lost 13 to 65p. Macarthy gained 12 to 293p on further consideration of results announced on Thursday and hopes that the MMC will clear proposed bids by Lloyds Chemists and UniChem. Photocopier supplies company Eurocopy lost recent gains and fell 17 1/2 to 82 1/2 , after the full-year figures. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1991/92 NEW HIGHS (65).

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Mijo Matanovic, chairman of the Provisional </F> Zupanija Committee of the Croatian Democratic Union of Bosanska  Posavina, by Ivan Sabic; place and date not given: "We Have To  Show Our Teeth"]    [Text] Following occupation of a large portion of Bosanska  Posavina [Sava Valley in Bosnia], silence prevailed about this  problem for a long time, and then the time came when, primarily  thanks to the awakening of the Posavina people themselves and  proclamation of an autonomous province, people began to talk  about Posavina, and then another time of silence ensued.  Autonomy has been almost forgotten. That is why at the beginning  of the interview with Mijo Matanovic, chairman of the  Provisional Zupanija Committee of the HDZ [Croatian Democratic  Union] of Bosanska Posavina, we asked whether establishment of  the federation and the borders of the Posavina Canton proposed  by the Vienna agreement are the reason why the talk about  autonomy died out?    "Posavina has always been different from Herceg-Bosna.  Because it is also physically distant, and communications are  complicated, there was a desire for some autonomy, but it was  not an endeavor to separate Posavina from other Croatian  regions, but of autonomy within that space. Establishment of the  canton brings about a kind of realization of that aspiration.  The only essential thing for us is for Bosanska Posavina to be  preserved intact as a Croatian space, and it makes absolutely no  difference whether that is a province, canton, or something  else."  <H5>  Why Are Brcko and Gradacac in the Muslim Canton? </H5>   [Sabic] Are you satisfied with the agreed borders of the  canton? That is, they do not coincide with the borders of the  Vance-Owen province which the Posavina people considered the  optimum solution.    [Matanovic] There has been a departure, and this occurred in  the area of Brcko and Gradacac. Under the Vienna agreement,  those two opstinas belong almost entirely to the Muslim canton,  but the proposed map nevertheless has great importance, because  most of the Croatian space occupied by the Serbs has  nevertheless been included in the Croatian canton. However, it  is not clear to me why the territory of Brcko and Gradacac has  been included in the Muslim canton. When the map of Bosanska  Posavina was being worked out, we in the zupanija committee  tried to embrace the area in which Croats are in the majority,  and we had information that the Muslim leadership had nothing  against the opstinas of Brcko and Gradacac going mostly to  Posavina. No one explained to us what happened afterward.    [Sabic] Nevertheless, the occupation is the biggest problem?    [Matanovic] Of course. Especially because it is not very  likely that the Serbs will make any essential concession in the  area of Posavina in the negotiations.    [Sabic] That means that the military option for resolving  the  problem of Posavina is fairly likely?    [Matanovic] In that respect, the Posavina people have always  felt that we should show our teeth. After all, if we have lost  Posavina militarily, we never renounced it. I hope that today we  are ready to do that job.    [Sabic] A protest of Posavina refugees in Zagreb was  recently  announced, but very few assembled. It was later explained that  the meeting could not be held for certain technical and certain  political reasons, but the fact is that very few people came and  that fewer and fewer people are coming to meetings like that.  What is your interpretation?    [Matanovic] I do not know what actually happened in the case  which you mention, but it seems to me that there have been too  many of these rallies and meetings about Bosanska Posavina, and  that might be the reason. We who are operating on the territory  on the other side of the Sava believe the essential thing is for  all ideas and all proposals to come right from the free portion  of Posavina. In that area, all the occupied opstinas have their  own brigades, the opstina HVO's [Croatian defense councils], and  opstina committees of the HDZ, so that all conditions exist for  initiatives to come from there to solve the problems essential  to the future of Posavina. It seems that the Posavina people  have grown cool to all the ideas raised from outside that region.    [Sabic] Are you maintaining any relations with the refugees?    [Matanovic] There is an agency in every opstina which is  concerned with the refugees. In the cantonal government system,  there will also be an office for displaced persons in Bosanska  Posavina, which will provide us far greater opportunities for  contact with refugees from Posavina.    [Sabic] For several weeks, battles have been announced for  the space through which the Serbian corridor passes; it is said  that those battles might be decisive for the outcome of the war  in Bosnia and Herzegovina. What is the situation in Posavina, do  you take the position that it is ready for that development of  events?  <H5>  The Corridor Is Important to Us and to Them </H5>   [Matanovic] It is clear that the corridor is the biggest  problem of Posavina, but also of Croats and Muslims in Bosnia  and Herzegovina in general. Serbian propaganda has done its job  concerning that problem, it has created the idea that the  corridor is a necessity if there is to be an end to the war.  However important it is to them for the corridor to survive, it  is important to us that it not exist, and it is certain that we  will try to realize our desire.    [Sabic] Nevertheless, there will have to be some  transportation connection of the Serbian regions in western  Bosnia with Serbia in the final demarcation, at least in some  transitional period to full normalization of relations in Bosnia  and Herzegovina. Do you have any proposal for solving that  problem?    [Matanovic] There will have to be some compromise. If the  Muslims are able to pass into western Bosnia, and the Croats  from Posavina to southern parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina, then  the Serbs will have to pass to Banja Luka. In that sense, it  probably will be possible to achieve some agreement. But the  corridor in the sense it has today will not exist. There  possibly could be a highway under international supervision.    [Sabic] A portion of the Croatian population from Brcko  Opstina is on the other side of the corridor; the 108th (Brcko)  Infantry Brigade of the HVO is also there. Are you maintaining  any contacts? Is there coordination?    [Matanovic] A system of communications with Brcko Opstina  exists at the level of the military commander, that is, at the  level of the corps district, so that some contacts are made, but  I cannot talk about details.    [Sabic] The question of the fall of Posavina is often  raised,  and in this connection there is always talk about the fall of  Odzak, Derventa, Modrica, and Bosanski Brod, but no mention is  made of the fall of Bosanski Samac, which came under Serbian  occupation almost without a fight. What is the reason for that?    [Matanovic] In my judgment, the fall of Samac signified the  beginning of the fall of Posavina. I do not know why this is not  being paid the attention it deserves, but the fact is that no  steps whatsoever have been noticeable since that opstina fell  under Serbian authority.    [Sabic] The soldiers in Posavina are announcing that unless  there is an appropriate political decision and organized  liberation of Posavina they may undertake independent action.  One action has in fact been carried out, rather unsuccessfully  it seems. Do you expect that there really could be others?    [Matanovic] You are probably thinking of the Svilaj action.  However, I would not say that this was an unsuccessful action;  if nothing else, it showed the fighting determination of the  Posavina fighting man. I think that such actions are possible in  the future as well. It will be difficult to control them if  nothing is done to solve the question of Bosanska Posavina, if  not by peaceful means, then by taking coordinated military  action.</p>

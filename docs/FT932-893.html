			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Attali quits as EBRD chief 'in bank's interest': Press criticism over finances blamed MR Jacques Attali yesterday said he will resign as president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the aid bank he was instrumental in creating two years ago. He will remain in place until a successor is elected by the board of governors. His decision follows months of criticism of the bank's financial controls, including the disclosure in the Financial Times yesterday that Mr Attali had been reimbursed twice for a first-class return flight to Tokyo in May 1992 and that he had been paid Dollars 30,000 (Pounds 20,000) for making a speech in Japan. Over the past three months, the bank has been criticised for its slowness in making investments in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union  - which it was set up to do  - and also for the Pounds 55.5m it has spent on furnishing its offices and additional sums spent on the use of private jets and other overheads. A bank executive said Mr Attali made up his mind to quit early yesterday morning. He telephoned Mrs Anne Wibble, the Swedish finance minister and chairman of the EBRD's finance directors, to tell her his decision. In a letter to Mrs Wibble he said: 'The bank has come under increasing negative press attention in recent months. I know of no action that I have taken that in any way could be worthy of reproach.' The letter continues that this 'attention' has begun to damage the bank and that 'it is with the interests of the bank in mind that I have taken this decision'. In a statement released after Mr Attali's resignation, Mrs Wibble said: 'Considering recent events, I understand and respect his decision . . . I acknowledge that the institution has become fully operational with remarkable speed under the energetic leadership of Mr Attali.' Mr Attali called an impromptu meeting of the bank's 23 directors, who represent the 56 countries and agencies which own the bank, to say he would be leaving. 'The announcement was greeted with relief from most of us,' said a director. 'Morale here has hit bottom.' However, the directors representing France, Belgium and Italy thanked Mr Attali for his contribution. Directors immediately began discussing in informal meetings how fast a replacement should be found and whether to go ahead with Mr Attali's planned management reorganisation. Three people were mentioned by directors as possible successors to Mr Attali: Mr Onno Ruding, the former Dutch finance minister, currently working for the US bank Citicorp, who came close to being appointed head of the EBRD before it was set up; Mr Karl Otto Pohl, the former president of the German Bundesbank; and Mr Jacques de Larosiere, the governor of the Banque de France. A director said there was an understanding between the governments of the G7 group of leading industrial countries, who control 54 per cent of the EBRD's shares, that the president should be a European, although not necessarily from a European Community member country. In France, reaction to the resignation of Mr Attali, who was adviser to the French president, Mr Francois Mitterrand, from 1981 to 1991, was mixed. Mr Roland Dumas, a former foreign minister and close associate of President Mitterrand, said 'the Anglo-Saxon establishment' had brought Mr Attali down. Officials in the conservative Balladur government reiterated France's attachment to the bank, but said it was open to changes. Page 2 'He had the vision.

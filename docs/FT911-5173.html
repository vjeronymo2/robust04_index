			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / Letter: Poll tax should not be included in the RPI Sir, Esmond Lindop defends the inclusion of the poll tax in the retail price index on the grounds that it was decided not by statisticians but by the RPl Advisory Committee after 'many hours of discussion' between the various interests represented on it (Letters, March 28). This is an exceptionally silly contribution to the debate over how we measure retail price inflation in Britain. It is precisely because the RPI Advisory Committee is composed not of statisticians and economists but of trade union representatives and low pay and social security lobbyists like Mr Lindop that it reaches such bizarre conclusions. 'Many hours of discussion' in a body composed largely of groups with a vested interest in bumping up the RPI are much more likely to be characterised by special pleading than intellectual rigour. Rates were included in the RPl as part of the cost of housing. This was probably defensible but, as rigorous intellects recognised long ago, the community charge is not part of the cost of anything. It is a tax. A tax is not a price and therefore has no place in a retail price index. I do not think any disinterested statistician or economist would dispute this observation.

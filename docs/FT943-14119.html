			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance - Personal Pensions (28): Going at 50? It's trickier than you think - Taxation / The bulk of the fund must be used immediately to buy an annuity, so the timing of the purchase is critical. However, Inland Revenue rules do not normally permit any delay When personal pensions were launched in July 1988, the government and life offices spent millions advertising the flexibility of this modern product. But in practice the Revenue's rigid tax rules and the pension providers' restrictive contract terms create an investment environment where genuine flexibility is sadly lacking. There are three main trouble spots to watch out for. Retirement annuity pensions Until personal pensions replaced them in July 1988, retirement annuity pensions (RAPs) were the main product for the self-employed and for employees who did not have access to an occupational scheme. New RAPs were not available after this date, but policyholders could continue to pay contributions to existing contracts. If you have an RAP but want to extend your investment choice, it is possible to take out one or more personal pension plans, but the two types of pension operate under very different tax rules and higher earners risk losing valuable tax reliefs if they mix contributions. Martin Korn, partner, financial services, with chartered accountants Blick Rothenburg, said: 'Once you pay in to both policies, then the personal pension contribution limits automatically apply to all contributions for that tax year. As the table shows, the RAP maximum contribution limits are generally lower as a percentage of 'net relevant earnings' - the earnings on which your pension premiums are based. But unlike personal pensions, RAPs are not affected by the 'earnings cap' which restricts the earnings on which contributions can be based to Pounds 76,800 for the current tax year. According to actuaries Bacon &amp; Woodrow, employees earning over the 'net relevant earnings threshold' for 1994-95 who want to pay maximum contributions should stick to the RAP or use the 'alternate year funding' method whereby contributions are paid to the RAP in one tax year and to the personal pension in the next. Any RAP tax relief lost during the personal pension contribution year can be mopped up through the Revenue's 'carry forward' rules, but you will need expert advice for this complex exercise. There are other important differences between the two individual pension plans. Korn said: 'Despite their attractions for higher earners, RAPs cannot be used to opt out of the state earnings-related pension scheme (Serps) or to take employer contributions. For both of these features you need a personal pension.' Company schemes The driving force behind the personal pension bandwagon is the apparent portability that they offer to young people who expect to change jobs and want to take their pension plan with them. In practice, however, problems arise when the new company offers membership of an occupational pension scheme. In most cases it is best to join company schemes in order to benefit from employer contributions, a guaranteed pension linked to salary and generous family protection insurances. However, under Revenue regulations, with a few minor exceptions, it is not possible to belong to an occupational pension scheme and to continue payments into a personal pension, due to the different tax rules. Unfortunately, investors who stop payments in the early years to a typical regular-premium personal pension plan, in order to join the company scheme, will find that most of their personal pension contributions have been absorbed by the provider's administration charges and the adviser's commission. To avoid this problem, use a fee-based adviser for the personal pension, so that the plan is set up on a nil-commission basis; or pay a series of single premiums, which avoids the high up-front commissions associated with regular-premium plans. Both methods allow you to reduce, stop and restart contributions without penalty. If you are locked in to a commission-based regular-premium plan, most providers are prepared to redirect the contributions into a free-standing additional voluntary contribution (FSAVC) plan. The FSAVC is used to top up company pensions, and is governed by occupational scheme tax rules. However, this option assumes that you can afford to pay contributions to the life office as well as the company scheme. Moreover, while topping up company pensions is a good idea, your first choice should always be the employer's group AVC scheme, which is likely to offer better value for money than the FSAVC due to economies of scale. And at retirement . . . Under personal pension rules, it is possible to retire at any age between 50 and 75. This may sound flexible, but in practice the rules are extremely restrictive. Once the retirement date is reached, under most providers' contracts, the bulk of the fund must be used immediately to buy an annuity which provides the regular income for life. (The recent White Paper suggested that this restriction will go in 1997, but details of the change are not yet available.) Normally you cannot change your mind once you have handed over your lump sum, and if you die the fund falls back into the life office's coffers. The level of income secured will depend partly upon the size of the fund and partly on the prevailing annuity rates, which are broadly based on long-dated gilt yields. Since these yields fluctuate significantly, the timing of the annuity purchase is critical, yet the Revenue does not normally permit any delay. For wealthier individuals who are prepared to take a gamble, there are options that allow the fund to continue to benefit from investment growth, but if the fund value falls, so does your income. A handful of providers sell annuities that leave the fund invested on a unit-linked or with-profits basis; while a second option - phased retirement  -allows you to divide your pension fund and buy, for example, three separate annuities at age 65, 70 and 75, instead of using the entire fund to purchase a single annuity. The delay in the final annuity purchase, which has to be made by age 75, should secure a better income, because rates are based on life expectancy, among other factors. Staggered vesting replaces the one-off annuity purchase with a series of annual transactions. This complex process can be very expensive, and you lose access to the tax-free cash which is used to provide part of the annual income. If you are interested in these alternatives, expert advice is essential, because you forfeit the guaranteed annuity income in return for the potential of a higher income if investment conditions are favourable and annuity rates improve.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------     Maximum contributions to personal pension plans and retirement                     annuity pensions for 1994-95  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                       % of net                       relevant                       earnings           NRE                          (NRE)     threshold  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Age           PPP*        RAP       (Pounds)  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Up to 35     17.5        17.5         76,800 36-45        20.0        17.5         87,771 46-50        25.0        17.5        109,714 51-55        30.0        20.0        115,200 56-60        35.0        22.5        119,466 61-75        40.0        27.5        111,709  --------------------------------------------------------------------- * Earnings on which PPP contributions are based are capped at Pounds76,800 for the 1994-95 tax year.

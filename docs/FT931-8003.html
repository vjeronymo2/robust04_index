			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Floods hit Ecuador provinces Dozens of people have been killed and thousands of hectares of crops destroyed by floods in the coastal provinces of Ecuador, writes Ray Colitt from Quito. More than a week of heavy rain has destroyed an estimated 10,000-30,000 hectares of banana, soya and rice crops in the province of Guayas alone. The province also saw 44 new cases of cholera. In the north-western province of Esmeraldas at least 22 people died in the floods and landslides blocked many roads. The Ministry of Agriculture confirmed that much of the country's rice crop had been destroyed, while the federal government announced immediate relief funds to the coastal provinces.</p>

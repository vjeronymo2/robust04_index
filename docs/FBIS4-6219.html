			<p>BFN     [Text] ARMY Chief Gen Wimon Wongwanit yesterday issued a  veiled threat to Cambodian leaders, warning them that Thailand  cannot maintain a good relationship with an "insincere friend",  referring to repeated complaints from Phnom Penh that Thailand  is helping Khmer Rouge leaders escape justice.    "Between human beings, true friendship is sacred. So it is  with international relations. Without sincerity, there can be  no friendship," Gen Wimon said in his strongest denials of Thai  aid to the Khmer Rouge in a week.    Gen Wimon also warned that without Thailand as "a true  friend", Cambodia would be in trouble. "I doubt whether the  friendship offered (to Cambodia) by others is as genuine as  ours," Wimon said.    Likening the Cambodia of the recent past to "a person  without  clothing, food, or shelter", Gen Wimon said Thailand has  demonstrated its commitment to its neighbour repeatedly with  various forms of assistance.    "We have given them help despite problems of our own. Now  that things have improved, the Cambodians have forgotten all we  have done for them," he said.    Wimon interspersed his accusations of ingratitude with  hinted  allegations that enemies of Thailand had bribed Cambodian  leaders to make these accusations.    Reiterating Thailand's anti-Khmer Rouge stance, Gen Wimon  said the army is losing its patience and will not tolerate  further accusations.    Cambodian First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh and  Foreign Minister Prince Norodom Sirivut, both of whom maintained  a good relationship with the Thai military during their struggle  against the Vietnamese-backed former government in Phnom Penh,  have stepped up their allegations over the last week.    Last Wednesday Ranariddh went so far as to say he would  order  Cambodian troops to fire on any Khmer Rouge tanks observed on  Thai soil.    Armed Forces' spokesman Lt Gen Anuson Kritsanaserani,  meanwhile, confirmed that the cancellation of Supreme Commander  Air Chief Marshal Woranat Aphichari's trip to Cambodia was a  protest over the Cambodian accusations.    The decision came on Friday, one day after the Cambodian  Foreign Ministry informed its Thai counterpart of the  postponement of Cambodian Second Prime Minister Hun Sen's trip  to Thailand, following a closed-door session which included  members of the Foreign Ministry and the armed forces.    Gen Anuson does not believe, however, that the cancellations  will necessarily worsen the situation.    The Thai Foreign Ministry also lodged a formal protest when  Thai Ambassador to Cambodia Sakthip Krairoek paid a courtesy  call on Cambodian Foreign Minister Prince Norodom Sirivut  yesterday.    "Now we wait and see," said Gen Anuson.    Anuson denied reports that Khmer Rouge leaders are hiding in  the Phnom Dong-Rak mountain range, which straddles the  Thai-Cambodian border, saying the immigration controls in the  area are very strict.    The spokesman suspects the spill-over of Cambodian shelling  onto Thai soil was deliberate and said it could have been  avoided if the Cambodian military commanders were serious about  it.    He also believes the accusations against Thailand were in  retaliation for the unwanted repatriation of Cambodians believed  to be the families of Khmer Rouge guerrillas fleeing the town of  Pailin, a former Khmer Rouge stronghold, which fell to  government troops on March 19.</p>

			<p><P> March 13, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LAKERS REMINDED GIMMES CAN TAKE IN 107-102 WIN  </P> <P> Mychal Thompson directed the opening tip to Magic Johnson, who pivoted and  delivered a no-look bounce pass to Byron Scott running on the left side of the  lane for a dunk.  </P> <P> Four seconds had elapsed, and the Lakers already had displayed their dominance  over the Charlotte Hornets Monday night. Losers of 22 of their previous 24  games, and playing without injured Rex Chapman and Dell Curry, the Hornets  figured to be out of contention even with the Lakers leading, 2-0, with 47  minutes 56 seconds to play.  </P> <P> But the Lakers, winners of 16 of their previous 18, would soon discover that  there are no sure things, even when the team with the NBA's best record plays  the one with the worst.  </P> <P> Trailing by as many as 11 points in the first half, and still behind by four  points with eight minutes to play, the Lakers escaped with a 107-102 victory  before 23,901 at the Charlotte Coliseum.  </P> <P> "We got the win, which is what we wanted," Laker Coach Pat Riley said. "We had  to work for it, but it wasn't because we weren't ready. I thought we played as  hard as we could. Charlotte just played great."  </P> <P> Not concerned with appearances this time, the Lakers said they were quite  pleased merely to win Monday. The Lakers (47-14) needed another victory to  remain percentage points ahead of the Detroit Pistons for the league's best  record and extend their Pacific Division lead over Portland to four games.  </P> <P> "I tell you," Johnson said, "they played real well. I don't know if any other  team could have beaten them tonight."  </P> <P> As in their 10-point loss to the Pistons on Sunday night, the Hornets folded in  the fourth quarter under defensive pressure. Detroit held Charlotte scoreless  for the final 5:58; the Lakers held the Hornets to only one field goal in the  first 10:03 of the fourth quarter. During that span, the Lakers built a 99-93  lead thanks to their defense.  </P> <P> The Lakers took their first lead since the early going with 4:01 left on two  free throws by Orlando Woolridge. Woolridge then stole the ball from Armon  Gilliam and passed to Johnson, who passed to Thompson for an inside basket and  a 97-93 Laker lead.  </P> <P> After a Hornet timeout, Johnson stripped the ball from Randolph Keys and passed  to Scott for a layup and a 99-93 lead.  </P> <P> Mugsy Bogues finally broke Charlotte's scoring drought by making a layup with  1:57 to play, but Johnson made a drive in traffic with 1:01 to play for a  101-95 lead and the Hornets never really threatened despite Robert Reid's  desperation three-point basket.  </P> <P> The Lakers said their comeback was a far greater accomplishment than Sunday's  eight-point victory over the Atlanta Hawks. A loss to the Hornets would have  been a major blow to their record -- and their egos.  </P> <P> James Worthy, who led the Lakers with 26 points, said that sometimes playing  the weaker teams is more difficult.  </P> <P> "Teams like this or Orlando or Minnesota, you have to play even harder," Worthy  said. "The only thing a team of this caliber has going for it is a tremendous  effort. A team like this is dangerous. They took Detroit to the wire (Sunday)  We had to play better than against Atlanta to win."  </P> <P> The Lakers made 52% of their shots, held a 42-37 rebounding advantage and  limited Charlotte, which shot 73.7% in the second quarter, to five field goals  in the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> "This is the type of game that lets us know that we have to come prepared every  night," Woolridge said. "We didn't play defense really well the whole game. But  we played good when we had to."  </P> <P> As usually is the case, Johnson made most of the big plays for the Lakers in  the final minutes. He had assists on three of the Lakers' last four baskets in  the final 4:44, scoring the other himself. He also had steals on consecutive  Hornet possessions.  </P> <P> It was a strong ending to an otherwise mediocre night, by Johnson's standards.  He made only four of 10 shots, committed four turnovers and had problems  guarding the 5-foot-3 Bogues, who had 21 points. But Johnson finished only a  rebound shy of another triple-double. He had 19 points, 15 assists and nine  rebounds.  </P> <P> "You can't perform the same Magic show every night, but he's still out there  with his teammates, creating a lot of things other players don't," Worthy said.  "You got to realize (Johnson) always attracts a lot of attention."  </P> <P> Riley said Johnson often tries to shoulder too much of the burden when the  Lakers struggle.  </P> <P> "He begins to feel the pressure," Riley said. "But when it counted, he came up  with the defensive and offensive plays. The whole thing at the end was just  typical Earvin Johnson."  </P> <P> Said Johnson: "You get frustrated because you see easy shots -- layups -- that  should go in, but go out. That happened to us a lot tonight. It wasn't like we  were playing bad. And we did come back to win. As long as we stay within  striking distance, I feel good, I feel like we can win."  </P> <P> Laker Notes  </P> <P> Byron Scott played on consecutive nights for the first time since suffering  reinjury of his left hamstring. He said he felt no pain. Scott also played with  a hip pointer suffered during Sunday's victory over the Atlanta Hawks. Scott  had 12 points Monday night. . . . Hornet guard Rex Chapman, originally thought  to have a strained right calf, has a broken right leg and will be sidelined the  rest of the season. . . . Dell Curry, another Hornet guard, missed the game  because of a sprained left ankle and tendinitis.  </P></p>

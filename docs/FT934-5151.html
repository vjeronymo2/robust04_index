			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / US predicts outline trade deal: Kantor hopes for preliminary agreement with EU by weekend Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, predicted yesterday that the US and the European Union would this week produce an outline of preliminary agreements for the Uruguay Round of world trade talks, including deals on agriculture and tariff cuts. But Mr Kantor, speaking before leaving for Brussels, said there was 'grave doubt' that he and his EU counterpart, Sir Leon Brittan, could produce a complete draft text this week. Mr Kantor's determination to conclude an outline deal within 48 hours was shared in Brussels amid fresh signs that France was prepared to soften its hardline stance. France has shelved earlier threats to veto a trade-liberalising deal within the framework of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. It signalled its readiness to sign an agreement if 'French national interests are protected'. The French move follows warnings from Germany and the UK that failure to reach a Gatt deal would jeopardise prospects for an economic recovery in Europe and risk splitting the EU. Underlining German concern, Chancellor Helmut Kohl and French prime minister Edouard Balladur agreed, on the opening day of summit talks in Bonn yesterday, to work hand-in-hand for a Gatt deal. Mr Kantor, voicing optimism, said there was 'great flexibility' in talks on market access for farm products. He also hinted that preliminary agreement had been reached on rules for a new multinational trading organisation and said there was 'great room for manoeuvrability' on the dispute over trade in audiovisual products. Mr Mike Espy, the US agriculture secretary, hinted that the Clinton administration was prepared to modify its adamant refusal to renegotiate its position on the Blair House accord on farm trade. Mr Jacques Delors, the European Commission president, said, after addressing a French parliament committee, that 'the Americans seem to be beginning to budge' towards meeting European demands on reducing tariffs and liberalising services. Meanwhile, French farm union leaders vowed to step up their efforts to prevent any retreat by France in its opposition to the Blair House agreement. Background, Page 4</p>

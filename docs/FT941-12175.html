			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / Labour urges faster cheque crediting Labour yesterday called for action to prevent high street banks from making Pounds 300m a year out of customers by delaying the crediting of cheques to private individual and business accounts. Mr Nigel Griffiths, Labour's consumer spokesman, said he had asked the banking ombudsman to intervene and was seeking a meeting with Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury. Three of the high street banks - National Westminster, Lloyds and Midland - advise customers that it takes four days for cheques to clear and be credited to their account, said Mr Griffiths. Cheques are cleared within three days, he said, letting the banks earn an extra day's interest on customers' money.</p>

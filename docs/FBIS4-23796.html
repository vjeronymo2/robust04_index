			<p>BFN     [Text] Government backed militias, Interahamwe, have  extended their killings to neighboring countries. The militias,  apart from the killings within Rwanda, are now also killing  people in refugee camps, mainly in Tanzania and Burundi. The  militias have organized gangs with code names and use whistles  as their signals when carrying out their murderous plans.    Before the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] took up control of  areas bordering Tanzania, the militias killed thousands of  people, mainly the Tutsi and some Hutu in the opposition. Those  who managed to escape these killings took refuge in Tanzania,  making the first batch of refugees going to Tanzania since the  war resumed in the month of April. When the RPF forces advanced  and took over the areas of Kibungo, the militias also took to  their heels, and sought refuge in Tanzania as the second batch  of refugees. Thousands of pangas [machetes] that were used for  killing were abandoned by the militias at Rusumo on the Rwandan  side. The militias came to live in the same refugee camps with  people who ran away from their acts of murder. Known militias,  like Gatete, the former leader of Commune Murambi, and Mpambara,  of Commune Rukara, who fled after untold mass killings in  churches, are among the people who went to the refugee camps in  Tanzania, and the Tanzanian authorities know very well that  these militias are in their country.    The Tanzanian Government should be able to give security to  the refugees and stop the killings done by militias in the  refugee camps. Militias have killed people in the refugee camps  at Ngara, but surprisingly the district commissioner of Ngara,  Brigadier Alexander (Henedi) refuses to accept this. The UNHCR  should do everything possible to save these people whose lives  are threatened in countries of asylum. Occasionally, the  refugees in Tanzania have been stopped by local authorities  there, to go back to their country. Some have had to pay bribes  and others robbed, so as to be allowed to cross the borders to  return home. It is a right of every person who seeks asylum in  another country to go back to his own country the moment he  feels that his life is no longer threatened. The Tanzanian  authorities therefore and the UNHCR should facilitate people who  want to go back to their country, instead of leaving them to be  killed by the very people they ran away from. The killing of  the Tutsi in refugee camps in neighboring countries is a plan by  the Hutu exteremists who through their radio RTLM  [Radio-Television Libre Des Milles Collines] call for the  extermination of the Tutsi and Hima [Tutsi clan] people in the  region. The authorities in refugee camps in Tanzania and  Burundi should crack down on these gangs of militias, apprehend  them, and bring to justice the criminals.</p>

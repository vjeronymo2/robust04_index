			<p>BFN     [Text] Workers of the Urban and Rural Development Ministry  occupied ministry installations yesterday and held hostage the  deputy minister, who is the current acting minister. The action  followed the dismissal of 888 workers as ordered by Government  Agreement 152-94, which reorganizes the portfolio, reducing it  to three directorates.    Acting Minister Gustavo Cheng Becker advised the ministry's  union leaders of the cutbacks yesterday morning. Union  representatives rejected the order and initiated a protest by  occupying the ministry buildings, taking hostage the acting  minister and two Finance Ministry representatives. The two  ministry officials left the building later that evening.    Mefi Rodriguez and Maritza Palencia, on behalf of the  Finance  Ministry, agreed the government would pay compensation and other  such benefits provided by the law.    Acting Minister Cheng Becker explained President Ramiro de  Leon Carpio reached the decision based on the Government Agenda  he made public on 15 August. It was then when he decided on the  urgent need for administrative reorganization.    Cheng said this government agency will now function as a  Superior Directorate, a General Services and Internal  Administration Directorate, and a Rural and Urban Development  Directorate. The payroll will now have 22 people.    The restructuring led to the deletion of certain positions  which, according to technical assessments, were not needed to  carry out the work described by its law and regulations. The  affected positions were listed in Government Agreement 152-94,  he said.</p>

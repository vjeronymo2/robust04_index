			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / International Bonds: Sweden raises Pounds 200m with five-year Eurobonds The Kingdom of Sweden took advantage of the temporary strength in the UK government bond market yesterday afternoon to raise Pounds 200m through an issue of Eurobonds with a five-year maturity. The pricing of the bonds, to yield 24 basis points over the 6 per cent UK government bond due 1999, was widely regarded as fair and reflected the yield spread on Sweden's sterling-denominated paper in the secondary market. Lead managers IBJ International and UBS said that most of the demand for the issue came from Europe. The proceeds of the deal, which remained in syndicate overnight, were thought to have been swapped into floating-rate dollars. Some syndicate managers noted, however, that the pricing of the bonds on its own would not have allowed Sweden to achieve its perceived dollar funding target of around 10 to 12 basis points below Libor. The other main deal of the day was a Dollars 300m 10-year offering of Eurobonds from the US financial subsidiary of BMW, the German car manufacturer, which has an implied single-A rating. The bonds, which were priced to yield 66 basis points over 10-year US Treasuries, were deemed to be expensive when compared with yield spreads on outstanding 10-year dollar-denominated paper by other single-A corporates. Lead managers Dresdner Bank and Goldman Sachs reported solid demand for the bonds from Italy, Switzerland and France but said that German interest was muted because of a public holiday in parts of Germany. Nevertheless, when the bonds were freed to trade, they slipped from their fixed re-offer price of 99.85 to 99.75 and the spread widened to 69 basis points, according to some dealers. Elsewhere, Region d'Ile de France, the French local authority, raised FFr800m through an offering of eight-year Eurobonds which were priced to yield 25 basis points over the French government bond yield curve. Lead manager CCF said the bonds appealed to French institutions and retail investors in Switzerland. Generale des Eaux is expected to launch a FFr2bn offering of eight-year Eurobonds as early as today at a yield spread of between 45 to 50 basis points over French government bonds. The European Investment Bank was also thought to be taking bids from four investment banks for a Dollars 500m offering of 10-year Eurobonds. The price talk on the deal was between five and 10 basis points over the old US treasury. Syndicate managers said the spread on the EIB's deal could influence the pricing on the Asian Development Bank's forthcoming Dollars 750m offering of global bonds. The market also expects the Kingdom of Belgium to raise as much as DM1bn in the Eurobond market in the near future. The issuer is believed to favour a 10-year maturity but some syndicate managers believed that it would be able to achieve better pricing if it opted for a maturity of between five and seven years.</p>

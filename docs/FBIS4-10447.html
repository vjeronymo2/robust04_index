			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Passages within quotation marks in Creole] </F>   [Text] The official text of the resolution voted in the  Senate on 10 April was submitted to the House of Deputies today.  The president of the lower chamber, Frantz Robert Monde, has  some serious reservations on the resolution. According to Monde,  this resolution does not have much chance of being ratified by  the deputies' assembly.    [Begin recording] [Monde] "The reactions that I gathered  from  some deputies proved that they felt humiliated and indignant,  frustrated with the behavior of some senators who treat them as  children. They do not agree at all, and they even ask this  morning, [word indistinct] of the Senate, saying that this  building, which was built by Duvalier for the Chamber of  Deputies, is a building that was lent to them to hold the  sessions, and that the vile show that they offered us does not  accommodate the good relations that should exist between  senators and deputies. The wise ones did not give this example,  but asked that we take the building back to be used as a  committee room.    [Francois] "Do you think that it is a realistic plan?    [Monde] "In my humble opinion, what is the objective of  these  men?" These gentlemen want to have a new government, a new  Dessalines; I do not even say a new Toussaint Louverture --  Toussaint was a very flexible man who played with the great  powers; Dessalines said this is my country, and I am leading it.  Do those men have the will to do it? Will they find this new  Dessalines? Because my experience taught me that there is more  than one trend [word indistinct]. There is a greater tendency to  have ministers as friends. It is to occupy the realm of power.  Thus, I have a big question mark. In any case, we are going to  begin talking and see as soon as possible what to do so we can  endow the country with a government. [end recording]</p>

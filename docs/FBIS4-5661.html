			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 11 KYODO -- Gaishi Hiraiwa, head of  the powerful Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren),  said Monday [11 April] he hopes another reformist government  will take over from outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa.    "It is desirable that a government which will get the budget  through the Diet and carry on political, economic and  administrative reforms will be installed," he told a news  conference.    He warned that Japan will not be able to discharge its  duties  in the international arena unless the government carries out  reforms.    Hiraiwa said it is extremely difficult to single out  Hosokawa's successor at this stage but the selection must be  made within a few days.    Hosokawa announced in a nationally televised news conference  Friday he will resign as prime minister to take responsibility  for a stalemate in the Diet over his personal finances.    The standstill has held up the enactment of the national  budget for fiscal 1994 which began April 1.    Hiraiwa said he has given high marks to the Hosokawa  government's efforts for political reform.</p>

			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Britain may sell Thai embassy The UK Foreign Office is considering the sale or lease of its extensive embassy grounds in central Bangkok, which could raise up to Dollars 200m (Pounds 134m), according to diplomats and estate agents. Britain bought the five-hectare site in 1921, moving its mission away from the noisy Chao Phraya river to what was then a quiet, leafy suburb. But the embassy now fronts on to Ploenchit Road, one of the Thai capital's busiest thoroughfares and a prime real estate location. The chief clerk in charge of Foreign Office administration visited Bangkok recently to assess the possibilities. One option is to lease only part of the property and keep the rest. Diplomats say the Foreign Office wants to raise money to finance construction of new missions in eastern Europe. 'We are looking at all options to make the best use of the British embassy's estate in Bangkok,' said Mr Anthony Wilson, embassy spokesman. 'But no definite decision has been taken.' The cabinet is expected to have the final word. Disposing of the property may be controversial. The embassy grounds are one of the few areas of greenery in the Thai capital and every year the 'Ploenchit Fair' is held there to raise money for Thai charities; this quintessentially British affair of stalls, raffles and beer-drinking has proved remarkably popular among Thai families living in Bangkok. 'It's a common trend for embassies to sell up,' said Mr Paul Scales, managing director of Jones Lang Wootton in Bangkok. 'It's a super site and if it were tastefully developed it could be a landmark site.' Some British diplomats believe it could be foolish to sell the property outright. They recall the sale of a consulate building in the booming northern town of Chiang Mai which was sold for some Dollars 400,000 and resold by the buyer shortly afterwards for 10 times as much.</p>

			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / International Company News: Oerlikon in red but recovery seen OERLIKON-BUHRLE has reported an operating loss of SFr200m (Dollars 134.2m) for 1990 - its sixth loss in as many years - but its new chairman said yesterday the troubled Swiss armaments and industrial group was beginning to recover. 'We can now think about shaping the future rather than coping with the past,' Mr Hans Widmer said. Oerlikon has been in decline for several years, mainly because the former management, led by Mr Dietrich Buhrle for 34 years, was reluctant to restructure its businesses. Group sales last year of SFr3.6bn were 25 per cent lower than in 1985. In late 1990, with borrowings soaring, the big Swiss banks forced Mr Buhrle to resign and named Mr Philippe de Weck, the retired chairman of Union Bank of Switzerland, to plan top management changes. Mr Widmer, head of the Schweiter textile machinery group, was appointed chairman in April and has since led a massive restructuring effort. Provisions for restructuring amounted to SFr700m, but Mr Widmer said the actions taken would lead quickly to a turnround in cash flow. The group officially forecast it would be between SFr160m and SFr230m but Mr Widmer said yesterday it could rise to SFr290m.</p>

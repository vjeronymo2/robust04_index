			<p><P> July 30, 1990, Monday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OXNARD;  </P> <P> DECKING THE HULLS WITH HOLIDAY CHEER  </P> <P> They say that Christmas only comes once a year.  </P> <P> But not in Oxnard's Mandalay Bay neighborhood.  </P> <P> About 10 dinghies festooned with garlands, lights and at least one Santa Claus  cruised the canals of the 800-household marine neighborhood spreading some  out-of-season holiday cheer Saturday.  </P> <P> "Christmas is so cold you can't enjoy it, so we said, 'Let's just get crazy in  the summer,' " said Skip Harkson, who has organized the event for the past five  years.  </P> <P> Harkson, dressed in red pants and a green shirt, said the celebration also  serves as a block party and gives neighbors a chance to visit.  </P> <P> The parade of decorated dinghies started from a dock near Oldham Circle about 7  p.m.  </P> <P> June Bandy said she and her husband, Doc, love the summer Yuletide celebration.  </P> <P> The couple rigged their dinghy with a white Christmas tree that twinkled with  small lights powered by an on-board generator.  </P> <P> "We don't just have Christmas in December," said Bandy, her eyes alight beneath  her red felt cap. "We have it all the time."  </P> <P> Charlie Barton, dressed in a red nightshirt and stocking cap, said he has  participated in the parade for three years because he just can't wait for  Christmas.  </P> <P> Barton said Christmas and Halloween are his favorite holidays.  </P> <P> "I think they should have two Halloweens a year," he said, as Christmas carols  blared from a speaker on the dock.  </P> <P> Barton, who said he came to the parade in drag last year, decorated his boat  not only with holly and Christmas lights but with a giant, blowup beer bottle  as well.  </P> <P> But the event was not only for people on the decorated boats.  </P> <P> Curious onlookers motored by in their boats. Some slowed to take photographs of  the assorted characters.  </P> <P> Harkson said about 25 people had called to find out about the best vantage  point to watch the parade.  </P> <P> Rene and George Aney of Sunland were camping in Ventura with their  granddaughter Christine when they learned of the parade and headed over.  </P> <P> "We were interested to see what they had to offer," Rene Aney said.  </P> <P> After striking up a quick friendship with one boat owner, they hopped aboard  and joined the festivities.  </P> <P> Beverly Elder of Oxnard said she had come to watch the parade in years past.  </P> <P> "We love it," she said. "It's a real fun thing."  </P> <P> Others were a tad more skeptical.  </P> <P> "It's different," said Rob Woodson, 24. "I'll say that." CAROL WATSON  </P></p>

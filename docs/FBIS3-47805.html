			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed talk: "Warmongers Who Are Only Pursuing </F> Confrontation and War"]    [Text] The puppet Kim Yong-sam clique, which had noisily  said it would practice civilian politics, ceaselessly have been  playing with fire against fellow countrymen with outside forces  last year, challenging peace and [word indistinct], thus pushing  the situation of the Korean peninsula onto the brink of war.    The resumption of the Team Spirit nuclear fire game, which  is  known as the largest-scale joint military exercise in the world,  was followed by various war exercises in South Korea named  Ssangyong, Ulchi, Ulchi Focus Lens, Hwarang, and Eagle. This  turned South Korea into a virtual land of gunsmoke, where the  roar of guns and smell of gunpowder were ceaseless last year.    Under the pretext of the North's nuclear threat, the  warmongers with war frenzy did not hesitate to even have the  wild outburst of virtual declaration of war by saying that they  were prepared to take military countermeasures.    Traitor Kim Yong-sam, who had been proud of being in  civilian  clothes, unlike the preceding military dictators, visited  frontline troops at the end of last year, wearing combat attire  of the puppet Army, and bolstered the war mood of northward  invasion. This enables everyone to easily guess the level of  the civilian warmongers' war mania.    The puppet Kim Yong-sam clique has extremely aggravated  North-South relations and pushed the situation of the Korean  peninsula onto the brink of war by conducting adventurous war  disturbances with outside forces, ignoring the fellow  countrymen's peace proposal for achieving national  reconciliation and unity. This is an intolerable, antinational  crime.    The puppet Kim Yong-sam clique's indiscreet playing with  fire  aimed at invoking a fratricidal war did not bring them good  results. The appearance of those who were mobilized to war  disturbances staged by the civilian warmonger was pitiful.    A helicopter of the puppet Naval Command of Operations  crashed in Kumsu-myon, Songju County, North Kyongsang Province  last year, and some 10 puppet soldiers died in vain in this  accident.    Another tragedy occurred in Chungwon County, North  Chungchong  Province. An F16 fighter plane of the puppet Air Force exploded  in mid-air during a war disburbance and fell on a mountain in  the county.    The destiny of those who were frantically engaged in a  provocation against fellow countrymen in the air faced a  disastrous end. This reminds us of the maxim that those who  show mercy to others shall enjoy mercy from others.    According to the material presented by the South Korean  puppet Defense Ministry to the National Assembly last year, many  puppet soldiers died during war exercises against the North.  Many soldiers died during the merciless and harsh disciplinary  training in the South Korean puppet military or committed  suicide, unable to endure any longer their lives of employed  soldiers.    South Korea's Chungang University gazette carried an  editorial, which pointed out that the Team Spirit exercise is a  U.S. war disturbance that has no relation to the national  interest and that South Korea is in bad shape for willingly  providing the United States with a place for it. The editorial  also noted that the meaning of this exercise became clear under  the situation, in which the right to control operations, a key  element of sovereignty, has been handed over to the United  States, and denounced the exercise of pointing guns at fellow  countrymen, saying such a thing can never happen.    The South Korean people have branded the puppet Kim Yong-sam  clique as a group of civilian warmongers. The puppet Kim  Yong-sam clique has expressed its plan to continue the nuclear  war disturbance this year, too.    It would be quite absurd, however, if the puppet Kim  Yong-sam  clique intends to gain something by staging fire games and  lighting the fuse of war of northward invasion. The South  Korean puppets should better act discreetly, being clearly aware  that the nuclear war disturbance will only result in their own  ruin.</p>

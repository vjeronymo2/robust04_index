			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Algerian oil and gas find for Lasmo Lasmo, the independent oil exploration and production company, has made its third oil and gas discovery in eastern Algeria. The well, which is operated by Anadarko of the US - Lasmo's partner in the venture along with Maersk of Denmark, was tested at a cumulative rate of 8,100 barrels of oil and condensate and 82.5m cu ft of gas a day. It is the third discovery from four exploration wells which Anadarko has drilled in the area. Two additional prospects in the area will be drilled soon, according to Mr John Hogan, chief operating officer. The desert areas being explored have so far been free from any of the political violence affecting Algeria. But drilling crews and technical staff are flown directly to the area, thus avoiding the capital, Algiers. Further drilling to appraise the full potential of the discoveries is likely to take place later this year, the company said. It is also assessing the overall potential of Algeria in light of the string of discoveries. Premier Consolidated Oilfields, an independent exploration and production company, has found gas in a new field to the west of the large Qadripur gas field in Pakistan. The discovery in the Ghauspur block was in geology similar to that of Qadripur. But the different composition of the gas confirmed it was a separate field, the company said. Gas from the latest find has a relatively low calorific value and a high nitrogen content, but the company believes it could be marketable if the reserve proves large enough.</p>

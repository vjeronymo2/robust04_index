			<p><P> April 7, 1990, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> METS' DAVEY JOHNSON WEATHERS THE STORM  </P> <P> Just when the facts say that New York Mets Manager Davey Johnson ought to be  squirming in the heat, he says that the weather is just fine. "I'll tell you,"  he said, "this year I don't have any problems."  </P> <P> You know how the weather stories are in the Florida papers: Whether it's sunny  and 80 degrees or cloudy and a shivering 50, they tell you how nasty it is at  home. Johnson is a Floridian who made his riches with Orlando real estate  before Disney got there.  </P> <P> In the spring of 1988, Johnson was a lame-duck manager. This spring, he's  manager by split decision. Last year -- now that was cloudy.  </P> <P> "The fact is, we got a lot accomplished," he said. "Last year's situation could  have dragged out two years and the problems could exist today."  </P> <P> The most difficult circumstance a manager has to deal with is the fading star  who is convinced that he can still play. As a player, Johnson watched Earl  Weaver agonize over having to decide that reliable Don Buford couldn't do it  anymore. As a manager, Johnson had to deal with Gary Carter and Keith Hernandez  last year.  </P> <P> That was "a strain," Johnson said. Carter thought that he should play even when  he was hurt, and when Johnson wanted Hernandez in the lineup, he was often  hurt. Everybody knew that those two stars were near the end of their time but  the manager felt that he owed them a chance to buy more time.  </P> <P> Even though they won 87 games and finished second, the Mets did not handle  those problems with grace or maturity. Players crabbed about Carter, Hernandez  and Gregg Jefferies, and the way Johnson handled them. And that was why General  Manager Frank Cashen had to reject the corporate input that Johnson shouldn't  manage this team this season.  </P> <P> "I'd have been disappointed (but) it wouldn't have killed me," Johnson said.  But then he is quick to point out that this is his seventh season in the job  and no Mets manager has ever had that tenure. "I know I'm the best man for the  job as it is here," he said.  </P> <P> The situation suggests that, for the welfare of the manager, the Mets have to  get off to a good start. "If I worry about that, I couldn't manage the way I  always have," he said. "I've got to manage for the players and for the  organization. If I manage for Davey Johnson, that's not good."  </P> <P> His first required decision concerns his pitching staff. In spite of his degree  in math, he can not divide six into five and make it come out happy.  </P> <P> It's a comforting cliche to say that a team can't have too many pitchers. But  that's true only when it comes out right. Johnson has to pick four starters for  the early season and spread enough work for the others to be ready. It's  uncertain.  </P> <P> It's also uncomfortable. "They all know they're good pitchers; they all know  they deserve to start," Johnson said. "They all know they can't all start. It's  my job to handle it."  </P> <P> There are questions that skeptics see before these pitchers can be listed with  Lemon, Wynn, Garcia and Feller or Palmer, Cuellar, Dobson and McNally.  </P> <P> Which Dwight Gooden is this one? Is Frank Viola to be judged by last season? Is  Ron Darling better than the .500 pitcher he was last season? Is Sid Fernandez  last year's Sid or the previous frustration? Is Bob Ojeda sound?  </P> <P> At this point, David Cone looks like the best of this staff, but he is likely  to be one of the odd men out because he's versatile.  </P> <P> Not being so skeptical, all of them won't have bad years. No other team has  that depth of quality pitching.  </P> <P> But what about Darryl Strawberry? He's been outgoing and appears comfortable  here. But it's a long season. "I feel good about Darryl," Johnson said. "He  feels good about Darryl. If he's as happy all year, he'll be a joy to watch."  </P> <P> It is one of the fascinating bits of this season. Does Strawberry, after his  alcoholism treatment, recover to carry an unproven lineup?  </P> <P> Where does the backbone come from? Vice President Al Harazin said he thinks  that personalities will emerge that were submerged by Carter and Hernandez. But  that kind of talk rankles Johnson. "Those guys were great for this club because  they were great players," he said.  </P> <P> There is something to be said for standup players in the clubhouse as well as  on the field. Too often, last season's Mets said with their absence from the  clubhouse: Don't blame me.  </P> <P> And what about Jefferies? Seldom has a young player been treated with such  distaste by his teammates as Jefferies was last season. Blame everybody.  </P> <P> "I didn't handle it as well as I should have, the players didn't, and he  didn't," Johnson said.  </P> <P> The situation on this team is closer to what it was in 1984, when Johnson came  to manage and they had not yet won anything, than to the situation of last  season. Johnson is at his best with young players; he understands the value of  losing early in order to win late.  </P> <P> He was afraid of Jefferies' ego being crushed if he was sent down last season.  "I was not going to do that," Johnson said. "I had to help him get established  at all cost."  </P> <P> Jefferies responded with a hopeful second half. Now there is Keith Miller,  unopposed as center fielder.  </P> <P> "There hasn't been a guy who came up and didn't make it while I've been  managing this team," Johnson said. "I can name a lot of guys who came up with  high expectations on other teams, were sent down and were crushed. One of my  jobs is to establish players and get them to produce.  </P> <P> "I may lose a battle along the way, but my way is going to win more in the long  haul."  </P> <P> It's such a worry-free time now. The way Johnson talks, the only thing way they  can lose is with bad managing. "And you know," he said, "that's not going to  happen."  </P></p>

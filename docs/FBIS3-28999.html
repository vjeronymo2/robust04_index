He said: Today I am lifting the trade embargo against  Vietnam, because I am absolutely convinced that it offers the  best way to resolve the fate of those who remain missing and  unaccounted for.    The President reviewed U.S. efforts to search for missing  American servicemen and stressed that efforts will continue to  obtain more information about American servicemen who are  prisoners or who are missing. He also announced that a United  State liaison office will be set up in Vietnam to provide  services to Americans in Vietnam and help follow up on human  rights dialogue with the Vietnamese Government.    President Clinton also said that the decision does not  involve the normalization of relations: Before that happens, we  must have more progress and cooperation; more answers. In this  regard, he will send another high-ranking delegation to Vietnam  to search for additional human remains and documents.    Secretary of State Christopher; Secretary of Defense Aspin;  Joint Chiefs Chairman Shalikashvili; and many other high-ranking  officials and senators, including Mr. John Kerry, were among  those who attended the conference.</p>

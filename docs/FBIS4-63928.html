			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [AZERTADZH report: "`We Aspire to the All-Around Development </F> of Cooperation With the United States'"]    [Text] "I welcome the arrival in the republic of such a  representative delegation from the United States of America. We  aspire to the all-around development of relations between the  United States and Azerbaijan and in this context attach  importance to the meeting with you," Geydar Aliyev, president of  Azerbaijan, declared, receiving on 15 May a U.S. delegation  headed by James Collins, special adviser to the U.S. secretary  of state and senior coordinator of U.S. policy in respect to the  new independent states (CIS). The delegation, which had come to  Baku to study the prospects of the cooperation of the two  countries, also included Joseph Presel, chief of the State  Department Regional Conflicts Desk and U.S. representative in  the CSCE Minsk Group, and representatives of the Departments of  Defense, Treasury, and Energy.    Having expressed his respect for the leadership and people  of  the United States of America and the President of the country,  Geydar Aliyev emphasized that he viewed with optimism the future  of Azerbaijani-American relations and a strengthening of  relations between the two countries. We value highly the efforts  of the United States, he said, aimed at support for the new  states that have formed since the disintegration of the former  USSR. Considering that attempts are being made to deprive these  republics, ours included, of sovereignty and independence, the  support of the United States was and remains a powerful factor  restraining these attempts.    Speaking of the military conflict between Armenia and  Azerbaijan, which has essentially grown into a war and which is  seriously damaging the sovereignty and territorial integrity of  Azerbaijan, the president of the republic emphasized: "Our  position is unequivocal--the conflict must be settled  peacefully, and relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan and the  question of Nagornyy Karabakh also must be discussed only at the  negotiating table. Operating in this direction, we are  cooperating actively with the CSCE and its Minsk Group, of which  the United States is a member, and on which we pin big hopes."    As Geydar Aliyev observed, the development of Azerbaijan's  economic relations with other countries, the United States  included, will play an enormous part in a strengthening of the  republic's independence. In the president's opinion, the United  States also has an interest in the establishment of mutually  profitable relations with Azerbaijan--a state with strong  economic potential--cooperation in the sphere of the development  and use of the oil deposits included. We hope, he announced,  that the negotiations between the State Petroleum Company of  Azerbaijan and Western firms, of a consortium of which the  American Amoco and Pennzoil companies are a part, will be  concluded successfully. As you know, a stage of the negotiations  is taking place currently in Istanbul, and I hope, the head of  state observed, that the signing of oil contracts will be  possible upon their conclusion. Geydar Aliyev also expressed the  hope that cooperation in the sphere of oil production would make  it possible to expand contacts in other spheres also,  emphasizing that a strengthening of Azerbaijani-American  relations would be of importance for economic cooperation  between the two countries.    Other matters connected with the prospects of the  development  of bilateral relations were discussed also.    Rasul Guliyev, chairman of the Supreme Council, Fuad  Guliyev,  first deputy prime minister, State Counselor Vafa Guli-zade,  Gasan Gasanov, minister of foreign relations of the republic,  and Richard Dale Kozlaric, ambassador of the United States in  Azerbaijan, were present at the reception.</p>

Following the meeting between Chinese President Jiang Zemin  and Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa in Seattle last  November, Japanese Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata visited Beijing  in January and then Chinese Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji toured Japan  this spring. The series of high-level contacts between China and  Japan were brought to a climax as Prime Minister Hosokawa came  to China.    If Vice-Premier Zhu's visit to Japan had resulted in a  "China  fever" in Japan, then Prime Minister Hosokawa's visit to China  has made the "Sino-Japanese cooperation fever" even hotter.    The Japanese prime minister stressed that Japan-China  relations are one of "the most important pillars" in Japan's  foreign diplomacy and that Japan will provide effective support  to China's modernization drive.    The development momentum in the bilateral relations has  swept  away doubts in Japan's business circles. The Japanese side  expressed that more Japanese funds and technology will be  brought into China in the coming five years.    Observers here believed that the "China-Japan cooperation  fever" is the result of the evolution of the international  relations following the Cold War, China's high-speed economic  development and Japan's inside economic adjustment.    Now the international situation is experiencing a  transitional process from two poles toward a multi-poles. The  development of the friendly relations and cooperation between  China and Japan, two important countries in Asia and in the  world, will enhance the stability and development of the economy  in the two countries and in Asia, and in the establishment of a  new international political and economic order.    The frequent exchanges between the leaders of the two  countries show that the two sides have reached common  understanding and also signaled that Sino-Japanese relations  have entered a period of maturity.    People have noted that the exchanges between the top  officials of the two countries have striking economic features.    Last year the trade value between the two countries was 39  billion U.S. dollars, hitting a record high.    Japan has become the no. 1 trade partner of China; Japan's  technology exports to China rank no. 1; the rate of the actual  investment from Japan to China ranks no. 1.    But in view of the potential in Sino-Japanese economic  cooperation, much remains to be done.    China is stressing the development of the communications and  transportation, energy and telecommunications sectors while  Japan is exactly quite strong in these sectors.    It can be said that once Japan's technology and funds are  combined with China's market and resources, the trade value of  the two countries may reach 390 billion U.S. dollars, just like  Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji predicted in his recent visit to Japan.    Of course, Sino-Japanese relations are not confined to  economic cooperation and trade. The two sides share identical  views on major international issues. With the deepening of  mutual understanding, the two countries will surely make further  progress in their cooperation in the areas of politics, culture  and environmental protection.    The 21st century is approaching. At present, Asia is  experiencing a period of rapid economic development and relative  stability. In his meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa, Chinese President Jiang Zemin noted that Asia has  created an unprecedented opportunity of development in its  history.    The two sides agreed that they should seize the opportune  moment to establish long-term stable friendly relations and  cooperation on the basis of mutual benefit so as to meet the  challenges of the new century.    The frequent exchanges of visits between Chinese and  Japanese  leaders show the two sides are working toward this end.</p>

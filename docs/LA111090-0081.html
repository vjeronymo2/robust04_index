			<p><P> November 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RELIGION BOOKSHELF  </P> <P> THE GRACE AWAKENING. Charles R. Swindoll. Word, hardcover, 311 pages, $15.99.  </P> <P> The newest book of the Fullerton pastor went quickly to the top of the  Christian bestseller list.  </P> <P> Swindoll goes after "grace-killers," evangelicals who try to prescribe limits  on fellow believers' activity, whether it be moviegoing, dancing or worship  style. He says the forgiveness and freedom of grace is also the "oil that  lessens the friction in marriage."  </P> <P> THE PARALYSIS OF MAINSTREAM PROTESTANT LEADERSHIP. J. Edward Carothers.  Abingdon, softcover, 141 pages, $10.95.  </P> <P> A onetime national United Methodist official claims the dizzying decline of  mainline churches since the early 1960s might be solved by catching up with  modern biblical research and theology, abandoning bland "positive thinking"  preaching and stop blessing material success. JOHN DART  </P></p>

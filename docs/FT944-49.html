			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / Survey of Personal Pension Plans (1): The new deal for investors - The UK's first life and pensions products were sold in 1762. Now, 233 years later, the life offices must at last disclose the full extent of their charges. This survey is by Debbie Harrison Next week a quiet revolution takes place, which will transform the way financial products are sold in the UK and improve dramatically investors' rights. From January 1, 1995 the Securities and Investment Board, the chief regulator, and the Personal Investments Authority, the regulator for providers and advisers of financial services, require life offices and those who sell their products to tell prospective clients how much they deduct in charges. Later in the year, providers of all other investments covered by the Financial Services Act - such as unit trusts, investment trusts and personal equity plans - will be required to comply with the new rules. Previously, investors could look at the life office's 'illustration' of what their fund might be worth at maturity and be utterly misled. To calculate the illustration or 'projection', the life office had to make two important assumptions - the level of charges and the growth rate. Before 1988, there was no regulation as to what charges should be disclosed. Providers could also pick and choose the growth rate. Often the best-ever annual return achieved by the company was chosen to represent expected growth over a 25-year period - hence the notorious telephone-number projections associated with the industry at that time. In 1988, the regulators, under the Financial Services Act, curbed the more ridiculous projections by enforcing the use of standard growth rates. Unfortunately they also insisted that providers use in these projections a standard basis for charges that bore no relation to actual deductions. As a result, the life offices with low charges could not demonstrate the good value they offered, while the high chargers could hide their exorbitant costs behind the 'standard' format. Under this system, most investors had no idea how much of their money was disappearing in charges, and when. Salesmen urged clients to sign up for long-term regular-premium contracts (monthly and annual), because the commission they themselves would receive was higher. Sales commission was, and in most cases still is, based on the level of premium and the number of years to maturity. Most of the commission relating to the entire term was paid in advance immediately after the sale. Providers argued that this system was fair. Yet they obscured the heavy upfront charges by an actuarial sleight of hand. Investors' premiums in the early years would buy 'capital' or 'initial' units, which carry a punitive charge for the entire contract term. Alternatively, the 'allocation rate' (the amount of your premium actually invested) would be low in the early years. Either way, if a policyholder stopped paying premiums during the first few years of a long-term contract, he or she could be left empty-handed. Figures on pages 2 and 3 of this survey show this can still happen. If you sign up for a 20-year regular-premium personal pension, paying Pounds 2,400 a year, but stop after one year, you will get nothing back from British Life Office, Crown Financial, Hambro Guardian, Irish Life and Lifetime. If you stop after five years, most life offices offer a transfer value worth less than the amount you have paid in. Providers defended this practice by pointing to the often excellent returns available after 25 years. Yet they are reluctant to reveal how many of their clients actually make it this far. Office of Fair Trading research indicates that only one in seven long-term endowment policies ever reaches maturity. For the rest, the investment can represent a costly mistake. The threat of full disclosure of charges has concentrated life office minds wonderfully. In the run-up to the January 1995 regime, they pondered whether investors would still commit themselves for a 20- or 25-year term if they first saw the penalties for pulling out early. Their conclusion was a resounding 'no', judging by the flurry of revamped charging structures launched in recent weeks. Life offices realise that they must spread their costs over the entire term to make early-surrender deals look better. Allied Dunbar, Standard Life and the Prudential are among those which have already taken this step. Equitable Life has always operated this system. But life assurance is a slow-moving industry, and many offices were reluctant to see the writing on the wall. Some providers whose figures are not present in this report were still revising their charging structure only days ago. The new rules do not prevent life offices from selling poor-quality and expensive products - what they do is to make it easier for the investor to avoid them. For the regime to work, investors should seek independent advice from a specialist who has the software to compare quotations across the entire range of providers. Unfortunately, many will not, because a significant proportion of consumers do not understand the difference between company representatives (direct salesmen and tied agents), who by law can only recommend the products of the life office they represent, and independent advisers, whose job it is to select the most suitable product on the market. Some of the largest providers are direct-sales operations. Equitable Life, the Prudential, Pearl, and Allied Dunbar sell most of their products this way. So do the 'bancassurers' - the banks and building societies that use their high-street outlets to sell products generated by their life assurance companies. Barclays, Lloyds, National Westminster, Abbey National, Midland, Royal Bank of Scotland, TSB, Britannia, the Woolwich, National &amp; Provincial and, from January 1995, the Halifax, all operate in this way. (Some also operate an independent advice service, but only for clients who ask.) Most of the remaining banks and building societies, with a few exceptions, do not give independent advice, but sell the products of just the one life office to which they are tied. The most notable exception is the Bradford &amp; Bingley, which does offer independent financial advice. Independent advice is widely available, but still forms a minority sales outlet - over two thirds of regular-premium life and pensions business is sold by direct-sales operations. Of course, independent advice is not necessarily expert advice. Advisers have a mixed reputation, and the new regime will not turn the cowboy element into competent professionals. Moreover, the new rules only apply to charges. Some of the lowest chargers offer poor performance, while some of the top performers are also the most expensive. A competent adviser will marry reasonable charges with good performance, and also consider the flexibility of the contract terms, among other factors. The new rules on charges will be phased in over the next few months, although most large life offices operate the full system from January 1. Stage 1: January 1, 1995. From this date, direct salesmen, tied agents and independent advisers must tell prospective clients the exact amount they will receive in commission from the product provider after the sale is completed. They must also show details of the provider's actual charges over the term of the contract. This will show what your fund may be worth if you stop payments during the early years. However, these details initially do not have to be 'client specific' (in the regulators' jargon). This means that the example used to illustrate the provider's charges will be based on a hypothetical case, and does not have to relate to your own investment details. Stage 2: July 1, 1995. The provider's own charges for each particular sale must be explained clearly. All of this information is set out in detail in a 'key features' document, which the adviser or salesman personally must hand over to the prospective client before the sale is made.

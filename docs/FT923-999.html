			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Canadians warned on Nafta CANADA may have greater difficulty attracting both foreign and domestic investment following the creation of a North American free trade agreement (Nafta) area, the Conference Board of Canada concluded in a study published yesterday. The study, based on a survey of 240 companies with operations in Canada, says the 1989 US-Canada free trade pact has already altered the investment relationship between the two countries. Patterns are likely to change further as the recently concluded North American trade agreement is phased in, the study adds. Canadian companies are giving a higher priority to business opportunities in the US, while US subsidiaries in Canada are having to fight harder to justify their survival in a more integrated North American market. 'With the increased focus on the US market, a decision by Canadian firms to manufacture in the US and now Mexico is a distinct possibility,' the Conference Board, an economic forecasting and lobby group, says. The board notes that high production costs, which are one of the most commonly cited drawbacks to doing business in Canada, are likely in future to be as important in domestic companies' investment decisions as they are for foreign investors. Many of the foreign-owned plants in Canada were set up to cater exclusively for the domestic market at a time when local manufacturers were protected by trade barriers. But free trade has increasingly led companies to view the US and Canada as a single market. However, the board says that US subsidiaries in Canada, which make up the bulk of foreign investment, will survive only 'by carving out and justifying their existence as an integral component of the company'.</p>

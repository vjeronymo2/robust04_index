			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Ericsson wins Chinese contract Ericsson, the Swedish telecommunications group, has won a Dollars 400m contract to extend the telecommunications network in the Chinese province of Guangdong, the company's biggest deal to date in China. Under the three-year agreement, signed with the Guangdong Post and Telecommunications Bureau and Machimpex, the Chinese purchasing agency, Ericsson will deliver mobile telephone systems, AXE switching systems for conventional public telephone networks and transport network equipment. Ericsson said it would also supply equipment to pave the way for the establishment in Guangdong of broadband 'information superhighway' networks delivering telephone, computer and television services. China is Ericsson's fastest-growing market. It has doubled sales in both of the past two years and carved out a significant market share. China now ranks among Ericsson's top five country markets, accounting for some 6 per cent of group annual sales of SKr63bn (Dollars 8bn). The latest deal will help allay fears that Ericsson, the world's sixth largest supplier of telecoms equipment, could lose big public projects in China to competitors such as Alcatel of France and Siemens of Germany, which can utilise more substantial export financing assistance  - and political backing - from their home governments. This year, Ericsson lost a large Saudi Arabian contract which was awarded to AT&amp;T of the US, despite the Swedish company's belief that it had been the lowest bidder on the original tender. Mr Lars Ramqvist, Ericsson's chief executive, made clear before the Saudi contract was finalised that he feared he would lose it because of lack of political clout with Riyadh. Ericsson said discussions on financing the Guangdong project would start immediately.</p>

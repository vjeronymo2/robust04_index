			<p><P> October 29, 1990, Monday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: RENT CONTROL LAW TO BE REVIEWED  </P> <P> Mobile home owners in unincorporated areas of Ventura County could expect  annual rent increases on their spaces to stay at the current 5% ceiling under a  proposed new rent control ordinance.  </P> <P> The current ordinance expires Dec. 15, and on Tuesday the County Board of  Supervisors will consider a replacement.  </P> <P> Except for minor changes, the proposed ordinance is virtually the same as the  old one.  </P> <P> The supervisors have been bombarded with letters from mobile home owners,  mostly elderly residents, urging them to continue rent control because they  cannot afford high rent increases.  </P> <P> The rent control ordinance was adopted in 1981. It applies to 24 mobile home  parks scattered throughout the unincorporated area, with spaces totaling 1,555.  The average space rental is $185 a month.  </P> <P> Last December the supervisors changed the ordinance to include a provision that  allows park owners to raise space rent as much as they want when a home changes  hands.

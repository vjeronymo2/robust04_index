			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] GAZETA PRZEMYSLOWA I HANDLOWA, a  Warsaw-based "weekly for entrepreneurs and employers," published  a lengthy article in its 15-21 March edition, detailing the  contents of a report by the Gdansk Research Institute on Market  Economy (IBnGR) that provides a "map" of investment risks in  Poland, intended for both Polish and foreign investors. The  report provides a ranking of voivodships in terms of investment  risks, with Class A status referring to voivodships that offer  the greatest attractiveness to investors, Class B to high  attractiveness, Class C to average attractiveness, Class D to  low attractiveness, and Class E to very low attractiveness.  These categorizations were based on local market potential,  labor market, industrial base, business-friendly environment,  environmental quality, tourist potential, and commercial and  transportation infrastructure.    According to the article, research results "clearly show a  division into Poland A and Poland B," with voivodships in  eastern Poland and in urban areas in central Poland generally  proving to have "the least attractive investment climate." The  Suwalki, Lomza, and Elblag voivodships in northern Poland were  found to have the least environmental degradation, while the  worst environmental quality was found in the heavily  industrialized areas of both Upper and Lower Silesia as well as  in other centers where heavy industry is concentrated.    The report traced the wide disparities in infrastructure and  environmental quality to the uneven regional development  policies of the communist era. "For many years, regional  authorities were incapacitated," stated the report, and  financial resources reached the regions only through the central  budget, with priorities often dictated by political reasons  instead of by economic requirements. The result has been "huge  disproportions in Poland's regional development."    The areas showing the least investment risk, those with  Class  A status, are the capital city voivodship of Warsaw, followed by  Katowice, Gdansk, and Poznan. These are cities with a "certain  renown, a large industrial base, and a marked diversity of  market potential." These voivodships are generally known  outside of Poland and possess a certain "magnetism" in terms of  attracting investments, demonstrated by the fact that most of  the joint-venture companies currently operating in Poland are  located in them.    According to the report, chances for developing "weaker  regions" of Poland rest to a large degree with the regional  authorities, which are "responsible for creating conditions  conducive to investment." In addition, border regions may  benefit from the increased opening up of the borders. Highway  construction and privatization should also contribute to the  promotion and development of certain regions. The IBnGR  researchers also note that the flow of investments can also  contribute to eliminating the differences in development between  regions.    In addition to the Class A voivodships listed above, the  remaining Class B through Class E voivodships are given below,  in order of investment risk:    Class B--Wroclaw, Krakow, Szczecin, Lodz.    Class C--Bydgoszcz, Olsztyn, Koszalin, Bielsko-Biala,  Slupsk,  Leszno, Lublin.    Class D--Rzeszow, Opole, Elblag, Walbrzych, Kalisz,  Bialystok, Kielce, Gorzow, Zielona Gora, Suwalki, Torun,  Legnica, Jelenia Gora, Lomza, Konin, Krosno, Nowy Sacz, Plock,  Czestochowa, Ciechanow, Siedlce, Chelm, Tarnobrzeg, Skierniewice.    Class E--Radom, Piotrkow, Biala Podlaska, Zamosc, Sieradz,  Przemysl, Tarnow, Ostroleka, Wloclawek.</p>

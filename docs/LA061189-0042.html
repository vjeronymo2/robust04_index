			<p><P> June 11, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DINING OUT: SEAFOOD DISHES APLENTY ON THE ISLAND OF MADEIRA  </P> <P> It's a contender for the ugliest fish in the ocean, but espada, the local  specialty of Madeira, is one of the world's great seafoods.  </P> <P> By itself, the fish is reason enough to visit this Portuguese island some 350  miles off the coast of North Africa, but Madeira has a wealth of local dishes  you can't get anywhere else.  </P> <P> "The only place you can find espada (black scabbard fish) is in the cold, very  deep waters of the Bay of Funchal," said Virgilio Gavina, chef and owner of  Golfinho, a seafood restaurant in Funchal's old and cobblestoned fishermen's  quarter.  </P> <P> Inside, his restaurant is a nautical fantasy of portholes, metal ship's doors  and even an indoor pool surrounding the bar, but we chose to eat on the front  patio, where the afternoon sun filtered through a yellow-and-blue awning.  </P> <P> Earlier, in the bustling, open-air market, we'd come face to fin with an espada  -- a long, black fish with a perpetual frown -- and were eager to try it. But  first came sopa de peixe, a robust fish soup made with onion, tomato, garlic  and pepper, and served with traditional Madeiran bread made with sweet potato.  </P> <P> Similar to French bread, the small round loaf had a heavier, moister texture,  and the sweet potato added a pleasing richness.  </P> <P> The next course was polvo a Virgilio -- octopus cooked in white wine and olive  oil and served in a piquant sauce of tomato, bay leaves, garlic and onion.  Tender and smooth in texture, the octopus was not rubbery, and the sauce  achieved a nice balance of sour and sweet flavors.  </P> <P> Then came the espada, prepared in the traditional Madeiran manner -- dipped in  egg batter, sauteed and served with fried bananas. The light, delicate white  fish was moist, sweet and absolutely fresh. Accompaniments were rice with red  peppers and French-fried potatoes enhanced with a light touch of garlic.  </P> <P> For dessert we had Madeira cake, made with molasses, cinnamon, nuts and Madeira  wine. Topped with a big dollop of creme fraiche, the cake was delicious, but we  could eat only a few calorie-laden bites.  </P> <P> "The traditional bolo de mel (a kind of fruitcake) is even richer," said  Gavina, noting that we weren't even making a dent in the portion. "Madeiran  families make it at home on holidays. It would be too heavy for most visitors,  so we serve a lighter version at the restaurant."  </P> <P> Our meal cost 3,300 escudos per person (about $20 U.S. at the current exchange  rate of 156 to the dollar).  </P> <P> Gavina, who with his wife Teresa has operated Golfinho for 12 years, learned  his culinary skills from his father, Raul Gavina, who owns the family's other  seafood restaurant, Gavina's.  </P> <P> On the Lido, just to the east of downtown Funchal, it's built right over the  water. The day's catch is displayed in a windowed refrigerator at the front of  the restaurant. When ordering, walk up, pick out the fish you want and tell the  waiter how you want it cooked.  </P> <P> We chose fresh sardines, which came grilled in olive oil and were served with  French-fried potatoes cooked with tiny bits of fresh garlic. A typical lunch  costs $7 to $10.  </P> <P> Another favorite seafood is bife de atum, tuna steak. We tried some at  Caravela, a modern restaurant on the main boulevard along the harbor.  </P> <P> Sitting by the window in this second-story restaurant, we looked out on the  sunlit ocean as we tried caldo verde, a traditional cabbage and ham soup that  was similar to a potato soup, with finely shredded, dark-green cabbage and  large chunks of smoked ham.  </P> <P> The tuna steaks came in thinly sliced fillets that had been marinated in  Madeira wine, garlic, vinegar and spices, and cooked in olive oil. Lunch or  dinner here will cost about $10 per person.  </P> <P> While local seafood forms a mainstay of Madeiran cuisine, a dish for special  occasions is espetada. Everyone says the best is served at Celeiro Restaurant,  on a side street in the heart of Funchal. Descending a few steps, we found  ourselves in a dimly lit cellar restaurant with white stucco walls and huge log  beams.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Garlic and Parsley  </P> <P> The espetada consisted of large chunks of beef that had been seasoned with  garlic and parsley and skewered on twigs of laurel. The meat was tender and  juicy, infused with the flavors and aroma of laurel and garlic.  </P> <P> For dessert, we had veludo, a pudding of milk and eggs topped with caramelized  sugar and raisins. It was similar to Spanish flan, but as with all desserts in  Madeira, it is very rich. Meals here cost about $10 per person.  </P> <P> To sample all of these Madeiran specialties, try A Seta, in the hills above  Funchal, about a $5 cab ride from the center of town. If you go early in the  evening, you risk running into bus tours, but don't let that dissuade you.  </P> <P> Go later and dine with the Funchal residents who start arriving around nine to  dine on the authentic local dishes. The sweet potato bread we had there was  freshly made and served warm, and the espada was sweet and tender.  </P> <P> Onion and tomato soup was made with fresh tomatoes and served in the  traditional manner -- with a perfectly poached egg in each bowl.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Iron Skewers  </P> <P> Here the espetada was served on long iron skewers and included chicken as well  as beef. We also tried bacalhau, cod fish that had been soaked in cold water  for at least 24 hours, then simmered for two to three hours in more water and  finally cooked in olive oil and garlic.  </P> <P> Of all the local dishes we tried, it was the least appealing, very oily and  slightly bitter. But we liked the other specialties, including inhame, sweet  potato flavored with garlic, and milho frito, a polenta-like dish made of corn  meal.  </P> <P> Entertainment begins about 8 p.m. and includes fado (Portuguese ballads sung to  guitar music) and traditional songs and dances. Dinner here will cost about $10  per person.  </P> <P> No trip to Madeira would be complete without stops at two local landmarks. The  Apolo cafe is on the main promenade in the center of town. For years it has  been the local gathering place for artists and writers.  </P> <P> Sit outdoors under one of the striped umbrellas and watch the people pass by  while you sip a cup of rich, freshly roasted coffee with steamed milk and a  bolo de arroz, a slightly sweet roll.  </P> <P> The other great tradition on the island is afternoon tea at Reid's Hotel. Built  in 1890, Reid's is elegant and very British. From 4 to 6 p.m. every day, tea is  served on a veranda that offers dazzling views of the Bay of Funchal.  </P> <P> We sat in rattan chairs at a table set with white linen, as the waiter wheeled  up a trolley with an array of cakes, including a ginger cake, fragrant with  spices, and a moist fruitcake. Tea for two, including the cakes, bread and jam,  cost about $12.  </P> <P> Not everyone likes the fabled local wine, Madeira, but this is the place to try  it. It comes in four varieties. Sercial is the driest and is often served as an  aperitif. Verdelho is medium dry, Boal is semi-sweet and fruity, and Malmsey is  a very sweet after-dinner drink.  </P> <P> You can taste all these varieties, tour the operation and buy wine to take home  at the Sao Francisco Wine Lodges in the center of Funchal.  </P> <P> Recommended: Apolo Restaurante, Rua Antonio Jose Almeida, 20099; A Seta,  Estrada do Livramento-Monte, 47643; Restaurante Caravela, Avenida das  Comunidades Madeirenses, 15-3, 26136; Celeiro Restaurante, Rua dos Aranhas, 22,  33322; Gavina's Restaurante, Rua do Gorgulho, 62918; Golfinho, Largo do Corpo  Santo, 21, 26774; Reid's Hotel Madeira, Estrada Monumental, 139, 23001; Sao  Francisco Wine Lodges, Avenida Arriaga, 28, 20121.  </P></p>

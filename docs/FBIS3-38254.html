According to an announcement by the Federal Interior  Ministry on Tuesday [1 February], 18,827 persons -- including  18,349 Russian Germans -- moved to the FRG. In December, the  overall number was 27,043.    According to the Ministry, the number of applications for a  notification of admission continues to decline: In January,  22,517 ethnic Germans applied for resettlement; in the same  month last year there were 28,731 applications.    Horst Waffenschmidt (Christian Democratic Union),  parliamentary state secretary in the Interior Ministry, spoke of  a "calming down": Obviously, the Germans now also see prospects  for the future in the settlement areas in the Russian  Federation. The FRG Government will continue to make efforts  for improving living conditions there. However, the success  primarily depends on the course of the restructuring process in  the CIS states.</p>

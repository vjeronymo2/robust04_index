			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Brussels, Feb 2 (AFP) -- Private sector steelmakers  in the European Community could be left alone to face an  over-production crisis unless they quickly accept a plan to  restructure the industry, EC officials warned here Wednesday [2  February].    They said the EC's Executive European Commission might drop  its plans to help finance production cuts, or to re-negotiate  quotas on cheap steel imports from East Europe, unless the  steelmakers agree on voluntary production cuts.    The warning came after EC Competitions Commissioner Karel  Van  Miert acknowledged on Tuesday that the Commission's rescue plan  was in trouble because private steelmakers had not volunteered  any offers to reduce output.    "We could not get the necessary cooperation from governments  and from the steel sector itself. Unfortunately, in spite of  the well-developed policies we have developed, we cannot deliver  the goods," he said.    Industry Commissioner Martin Bangemann subsequently set a  deadline of March 31 for the private steelmakers to make firm  reduction commitments.    If the deadline were missed, he said, the Commission might  abandon its plan to spend several hundred million dollars  helping dismissed steelworkers, and to lend one billion dollars  towards the costs of restructuring the industry.    Bangemann added that import quotas on cheap East European  steel imposed last year, aimed particularly at Czech steel,  might also be abandoned if the private sector did not cooperate.    The Commission wants the EC steel industry to cut production  capacity by more than 20 percent -- by 30 million tonnes of raw  steel and 20 million tonnes of hot-rolled steel a year.    This would mean scrapping at least 60,000 jobs -- a  sacrifice  which the Commission deems essential medicine for an industry  buffetted by over-production, falling demand, plummetting prices  and economic recession.    Last December, EC governments agreed that the public sector  would cut production by 5.5 million tonnes of hot-rolled steel a  year, on condition that they would get last-time subsidies  totalling about 7.5 billion dollars.    The private steelmakers are supposed to provide the rest of  the production cuts. So far, they have committed themselves to  cuts of no more than five million tonnes.    Now the Commission wants them to agree among themselves how  to share out the production cuts, with the healthiest among them  helping to finance the close-down costs of the least efficient  backed by EC aid.    But the private steelmakers are upset about the subsidies  authorised for their public sector competition in Spain,  Germany, Italy and Portugal last December.    They have expressed doubts about the promised production  cutbacks at these plants, and maintain that the state-owned  steel works should in any case be made to bear a larger share of  the cutbacks.    Bangemann and Van Miert are scheduled to meet European steel  executives grouped in the European federation Eurofer on  February 15.</p>

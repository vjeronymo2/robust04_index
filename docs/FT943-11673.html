			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / Compromise deal on US crime bill: Negotiators agree tough measures House and Senate negotiators reached a compromise yesterday on tough anti-crime legislation that will put thousands more police on US streets, ban several types of assault guns and impose harsher sentences on criminals. The huge crime bill, which will cost Dollars 30bn (Pounds 19.3bn) to implement, is a top priority of the administration. It passed both congressional chambers earlier this year in differing forms, but a House-Senate conference committee, responsible for reconciling the two versions, was deadlocked for weeks over several controversial provisions. The negotiators worked unsuccessfully through Wednesday night, unable to reach a compromise until mid-morning yesterday. In the end, they kept the ban on 19 brands of assault weapon, passed by both House and Senate, but adamantly opposed by Mr Jack Brooks, House chairman of the conference committee. The negotiators dropped the so-called racial justice provision that would have allowed minority defendants to challenge the death penalty by using statistical evidence that capital punishment is imposed more often on blacks and minorities. The influential Congressional Black Caucus strongly supported the racial justice measure, but Senate Republicans threated to use a filibuster to kill a bill that included it. The Black Caucus now says it will oppose a procedural vote needed to bring the crime bill to the House floor, but not the bill itself. The legislation also helps local communities hire 100,000 more police officers, gives states grants to build more prisons, sets up special courts to deal with first-time drug offenders, and increases from two to about 60 the number of federal crimes for which the death penalty can be imposed. It also mandates life sentences for third-time offenders whose last conviction was for a violent or drug-related crime, allows federal prosecutors to treat offenders as young as 13 as adults in particularly brutal cases, and makes gender-based violence against women a civil rights violation. Gender-based crimes include spouse beating and stalking. With the Clinton administration pushing hard for the bill, and members of Congress - many of whom are up for re-election in November - eager to prove to their constituents that they are tough on crime, the bill is expected to sail through both chambers in the next week. A vote in the House could come as early as today.</p>

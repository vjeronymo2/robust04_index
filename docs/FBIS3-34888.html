Culture and  Islamic Guidance Minister 'Ali Larijani has been appointed to  replace him.    It has been decided to appoint Mohammad Hashemi as the UN  envoy of the Islamic Republic of Iran in place of Kamal  Kharrazi, while the latter is to assume office as the Culture  and Islamic Guidance minister. Mohammad Hashemi has been the  head of the largest propaganda apparatus of the regime, the  radio and television, for the past 12 years. During the past two  years, he has been subjected to the taunts of those in the  regime who have been displeased with Hashemi-Rafsanjani's  policies. They have objected that the radio and television has  exceeded the boundaries specified by the Islamic Republic of  Iran and their activities have not conformed to Islamic criteria.    Until now, the radio and television apparatus has been  accused of seeking to propagate a non-Islamic culture and to  induct non-Islamic personnel. In reaction to the criticism of  the radio and television by the Majles deputies and individuals  affiliated with what is known as the hardline faction, the  Majles set up a special panel. The results of this panel's  investigations mostly affirmed the views of the critics and  those who were displeased with the radio's and television's  performance.    The ruling faction in the clerics' regime did not wish to  magnify this issue and, to give the impression that it takes  notice of the criticism of opponents, finally removed Mohammad  Hashemi from this post. At the same time, to maintain his  official status and to prove that the government had not been  influenced by the views and beliefs of Hashemi-Rafsanjani's  critics, he was appointed the regime's UN representative.    In view of the fact that these critics had also intensified  their objections against the former culture and Islamic guidance  minister and had forced him to resign and that recently they did  not have much to say about 'Ali Larijani, the Minister for  Islamic Guidance and Culture who has taken Mohammad Hashemi's  place, it indicates that the stronger faction inside the regime  has taken into account the views of the people known as the  hardline faction and has sought their approval.    It is likely that the appointment of Mohammad Hashemi, the  brother of President 'Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani, as the  regime's ambassador to the United Nations may be designed to  divert Western opinion about the president. The appointment of  Mohammad Hashemi to the United Nations gives the impression that  certain developments have taken place showing flexibility and  leniency toward the West.    The main question about this reshuffle of the regime's pawns  is: Will the internal critics of the regime be pleased with the  actions of Kamal Kharrazi, who is being considered for Islamic  Guidance minister? In general, regardless of whether they  conform to public interest, these changes seem to be aimed at  placating the opponents and supporters of Hashemi-Rafsanjani and  eliciting their concurrence in the form of a deal between the  two sides, while the hardline faction considers it a kind of  victory.</p>

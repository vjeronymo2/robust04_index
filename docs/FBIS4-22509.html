Golovin: </F> "Khabarovsk Postal Workers on Attack Against Newspapers . . .  with a Half Hitch"]    [Text] Khabarovsk--We are already used to it. Every time he  is about to start a subscription, the ordinary person, who  cannot imagine life without newspapers and magazines, freezes in  anxious expectation: what price surprise will the next  subscription drive bring him?    For example, in Khabarovsk, to get the central papers, which  come out five times a week, they were asking 13,260 rubles [R].  So that ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI, based on the catalog price, would  cost the subscriber more than R25,000--exactly five times more  than he paid in the first half-year. The head of the press sales  department at the Khabarovsk postal service administration,  Tatyana Aristova, and the head of the planning department, Nina  Vartseva, graciously presented all their calculations. This is  how it works. To the "catalog" cost of the subscription, the  postal workers add on 8 percent, plus the cost of one copy,  multiplied by the number of times the newspaper comes out. But  what norms are all these percentages based on? According to  their assertion, these are the expenses for organizing the  subscription itself, plus the cost of receiving, processing, and  delivering the newspapers.    Those living in Khabarovsk are actually lucky. What if they  were in Nikolayevsk-na-Amure, or Okhotsk, or somewhere else in  the northern rayon of Priamurye? There, the Khabarovsk price for  the delivery of their own country's newspaper would seem  completely laughable. In the north of Khabarovsk Kray, postal  rates for daily delivery of the central paper stun any  imagination--R46,000! Don't forget to add to this the "catalog"  cost of the publication as well.    May the Khabarovsk postal workers forgive me, but I  personally am of the opinion that they are going to great  lengths to rid themselves completely of the burden that the  newspapers are. Speaking to this is the organization of  subscriptions for the periodic press and its delivery, when all  imaginable and unimaginable expenses are passed on to the  Priamurye residents.    There is a completely different attitude in neighboring  Primorskiy Kray toward the lawful right of each person to  receive information. If in Khabarovsk each rayon's postal  service is doing its best to astonish the individual with its  own price for newspaper delivery, then here a single price has  been established--the same in Vladivostok as in the distant  settlement of Luchegorsk. Moreover, to the more mass and popular  publications, the cost of delivery is reduced by half over the  normal cost. This system has been in effect here for over two  years. And before starting the subscription drive for the second  half of the year, postal workers came out with one more  initiative, announcing for their partners a subscription,  despite their relatively moderate price, on credit.    "We do not want to lose subscribers," the head of the  Primorye postal service, Antonina Astanayev, told me. "Believe  me, postal workers have absolutely nothing to gain if the  newspapers go under."    Similar examples have absolutely no effect on the Khabarovsk  postal workers. It is useless to cite the February resolution of  the Russian president's judicial chamber on information disputes  about how several territorial subdivisions of the postal  service, occupying a monopoly position, have been willfully and  uncontrollably establishing prices for newspaper delivery that  significantly exceed the "catalog" cost of the publications. In  reply to this, the head of the Khabarovsk postal service, Otto  Grib, told a journalist from a local newspaper that the legal  chamber's decision is lying on his desk, too, but it is nothing  but a piece of paper which does not obligate him in any way.</p>

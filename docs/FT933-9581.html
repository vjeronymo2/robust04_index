			<p>930809 FT  09 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: Switzerland The collapse of the ERM looks likely to take some of the shine off the Swiss equity market. Its safe haven status has helped it rise by a third over the past year, but now other European markets may outperform as interest rates come down. Switzerland has to a large extent already enjoyed the relaxation that is expected elsewhere. Short-term rates are only about one point above the 3.4 per cent inflation rate. So the Swiss National Bank has less room for manoeuvre than, say, France. It may do little more than follow German rates down, which suggests a strong Swiss franc may dampen domestic recovery prospects. Some local factors also point to a period of consolidation. Nestle's share price has finally become caught up in the international anxiety over brands; there is a risk that the banks, in which the market has invested a lot of hope, may disappoint at the interim stage. It would be a mistake, though, to take this argument too far. The Swiss market's long climb has been sustained by fundamental under-valuation as well as its safe haven status. The former consideration remains valid. Consensus expectations for earnings growth of about 17 per cent this year put the market on a forward multiple of around 12, which makes it cheap by international standards. And it is not as if interest rates were actually about to rise. The safe haven advantage may even return if other European governments compound currency uncertainty by delaying interest rate cuts. Swiss equities can still scale new peaks, but it will require a little more exertion than before.</p>

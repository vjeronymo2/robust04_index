			<p><P> February 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MCMARTIN: SYSTEM ON TRIAL AGAIN  </P> <P> It's true that hard cases can make bad law, but they frequently provide  instructive examples. The never-ending McMartin Pre-School case, for instance,  has become, among other things, virtually an ongoing experiment in the criminal  court's ability to administer justice in the glare of massive -- frequently  prejudicial -- publicity.  </P> <P> There are two kinds of pretrial publicity: One is the sort of fair-minded  reporting that respects both the public's need for information on the conduct  of their police and courts and a defendant's right to a fair trial. Such  reporting is unlikely to compromise the administration of justice. There is by  contrast a strong suspicion that sensational, biased journalism can have a  distorting impact on a criminal trial and, particularly, on its jury.  </P> <P> Too bad that much of the pretrial publicity in the McMartin case was of the  latter sort. The fact that the criminal justice system was able to cope with it  was attributable to the competence of the defense and prosecution and the  hard-working judge who was willing to go to great -- and expensive -- length to  impanel an unbiased jury.  </P> <P> Obtaining such a jury required financing usable research into the publicity's  impact on prospective jurors. It required the judge to allow an unusually  lengthy and wide-ranging voir dire to ferret out biases unrecognized by the  potential jurors themselves. Finally, it demanded a pool of prospective jurors  large enough to contain those rare individuals able to set aside what they have  read, seen and heard and to decide a case solely on the basis of the testimony  given in court.  </P> <P> The fact that such individuals are there to be discovered should be a source of  enduring pride to the American people and a lasting vindication of the Founding  Fathers' faith in the jury system. But, as the McMartin experiment already has  demonstrated, finding those people adds substantially to the length and cost of  a criminal trial.  </P> <P> Moreover, the decision to refile the 13 unresolved charges against Raymond  Buckey has pushed the McMartin experiment into uncharted territory. What impact  will all the post-trial publicity have on prospective jurors, particularly  since much of it, especially in the electronic media, has suggested that  acquittal was tantamount to injustice? Let's hope that the forbearance, will  and wisdom of the criminal justice system will overcome the hurdles once again.  </P></p>

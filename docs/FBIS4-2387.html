			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 8 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier  and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen reiterated here today that  China would hope concerned parties take more flexible and  practical steps for comprehensive progress in the peace process  of the Mideast.    Qian made the remarks when holding talks with Faruq Qaddumi,  foreign minister of the State of Palestine, who arrived in  Beijing on Thursday [7 April] for a six-day visit to China.    Qian said that disputes between countries can only be  settled  through peaceful negotiations, which he said was well  demonstrated by the signing of an agreement between Israel and  the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) on implementing a  declaration of principles for Palestinian self-rule on the West  Bank and in Gaza.    The Mideast issue is a regional conflict which has lasted  longest, ever since the end of the Second World War, Qian said,  and the road to peace is still long and difficult.    He said that the Hebron massacre which occurred this  February  shows it an urgent issue to settle Palestinian question.    Qian said that China firmly supports the Mideast peace  process and will, as always, support the just cause of the  Palestinians.    Qaddumi, also director of the Political Department of the  Palestine Liberation Organization, offered a detailed account of  negotiations between Palestine and Israel as well as between  other Arabian countries and Israel, and the situation in the  occupied territory.    Qaddumi stressed that the security of the Palestinians in  the  occupied territory should be guaranteed according to the  resolutions adopted by the United Nations, and his organization  will continue to make efforts for a political settlement of the  Palestinian issue.    He also called for an early military pull-out by Israel so  as  to ensure a smooth implementation of the agreement on  Palestinian self-rule on the West Bank and in Gaza.    The Palestinian foreign minister extended his thanks for the  support from the Chinese Government and the Chinese people for  the just cause of the Palestinian people.    Following the talks, the two ministers signed an agreement  on  economic and technical cooperation between the two countries,  according to which China will provide an interest-free loan of  75 million yuan renminbi.    This is the second loan China has granted to Palestine. Last  year, it offered a loan of 30 million yuan renminbi to  Palestine, which is also free of interest.    According to an exchange of letters which was also signed  today, China gave half a million U.S. dollars in cash as a gift  to Palestine.</p>

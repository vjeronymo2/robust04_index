If you are a licensee in any of the mass media services, you should carefully review this Public Notice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Who Must Pay Regulatory Fees In 1994 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Most licensees and other entities regulated by the Commission must pay regulatory fees in 1994. This Public Notice concerns the following Mass Media licensees: commercial AM &amp; FM radio stations, commercial television stations. Low Power Television and television translator and booster licensees, broadcast auxiliary and international (short wave) broadcast station licensees. Non-commercial educational licensees are exempt from regulatory fees as are licensees of auxiliary broadcast services such as low power auxiliary stations, television auxiliary service stations, remote pickup stations and aural broadcast auxiliary stations where such licenses are used in conjunction with commonly owned non-commercial educational stations. Emergency broadcast service (EBS) licenses for auxiliary service facilities are also exempt as are Instructional Television Fixed Service (ITFS) licensees. Also, no regulatory fees are required in Fiscal Year 1994 for FM translators and FM boosters. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Why the Commission Must Collect New Fees <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The new requirement to collect annual regulatory fees was contained in Public Law 103&hyph;66, ``The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993''. These new regulatory fees, which are likely to change each fiscal year, will be used to offset costs associated with the Commission's enforcement, public service, international and policy and rulemaking activities. The new fees are in addition to any application processing fees associated with obtaining a license or other authorization from the Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> When Fees Will Be Due <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Fee payment dates vary by service.

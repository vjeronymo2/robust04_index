			<p><P> April 23, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> NEW CHERNOBYL EVACUATIONS SET  </P> <P> Realizing that they underestimated the extent of the Chernobyl accident, Soviet  authorities will evacuate 14,000 more people this year from the site of the  world's worst nuclear disaster, Pravda said today.  </P> <P> The Communist Party daily indicated that more work is needed to limit the  damage from the April 26, 1986, explosion and fire at the nuclear power reactor  that killed 31 people according to official figures.  </P> <P> Pravda said radioactive dust that has piled up in the 20-mile danger zone  around the plant will take decades to remove and will have to be processed by a  special, as yet unbuilt, complex.  </P> <P> The continued evacuations are the result of belated recognition by authorities  that the accident spread more radioactivity over a wider area than at first  thought.

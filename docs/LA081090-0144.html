			<p><P> August 10, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOTRE DAME BACK SUES NCAA TO REGAIN COLLEGE ELIGIBILITY  </P> <P> Braxston Banks, a former Notre Dame running back, sued the NCAA in federal  court Thursday in an effort to get another year of college eligibility.  </P> <P> Banks claims that NCAA rules making him ineligible to play this fall violate  federal antitrust law.  </P> <P> The rules make a player ineligible after he signs for the NFL draft and retains  an agent to represent him.  </P> <P> Banks made himself available for the draft in April but was not selected. He  graduated this summer and has applied to return to Notre Dame for a fifth year  of studies.  </P> <P> The lawsuit asks the court to block the NCAA from enforcing the rules that  prevent Banks from playing. The lawsuit also named Notre Dame and asked that  the university be ordered to renew his scholarship.  </P> <P> Banks, of Hayward, Calif., injured his knee during his sophomore season and  decided to sit out the 1989 season, his senior year.  </P></p>

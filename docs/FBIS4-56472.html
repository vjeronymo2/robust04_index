			<p>BFN     [Text] Lima, 3 May (EFE) -- About 55,000 state hospital  employees today began a three-day strike to protest the  "miserable" wage increase recently granted by the government.    Also 10,000 workers from the state oil company returned  today  to work after a 24-hour strike.    Consuelo Febrero, a leader of the hospital employees, said  that during the 72-hour strike specially appointed personnel  will take care of the emergency situations in the hospitals.    The strikers want higher wages, the release of the union  leaders under arrest, and the state hospitals not to be  privatized.    The workers said that Health Minister Jaime Freundt does not  want to listen to their demands, and this is the reason for the  strike.    In addition about 10,000 workers form the State Petroleum  Agency returned to work today after holding a 24-hour strike.    According to union leader Miguel Freytas, the workers oppose  the selling of the state oil enterprise to a private company,  because the enterprise made a profit of $86 million in 1993 and  profits may reach $200 million in 1994.    The union said it will call for longer strikes, and then for  an indefinite general strike, to keep the State Petroleum Agency  under state ownership and maintain the labor force of 10,000  workers.</p>

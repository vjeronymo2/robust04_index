			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Roberto Morejon; from the "Evening </F> Information Review" newscast]    [Text] The Cuban mechanical steel industry kept up the hope  over the past few years of economic restriction of manufacturing  urban buses with a high percentage of locally made parts. Even  though parts are scarce, the truth is that the goal has been  partially achieved.    Already rolling down the Havana streets are 32 of the first  order for 60 buses called train-buses, due to their high  passenger capacity, with hitches to adapt platforms or  semi-trailers with the appropriate body. Each vehicle requires  about 3,000 parts, in addition to 1.5 tons of metal, and some  materials obtained by convertible foreign exchange. But the  main manufacturing work is the responsibility of a group of  workers at an enterprise located on the outskirts of Havana.    The train-buses, which have a capacity of 350 passengers,  attract the attention of the Havana residents, who are tired of  the severe scarcity of buses over the past four years, resulting  from the termination of the parts supply contracts with Hungary.  With parts sent from Hungary, Cuban workers assembled up to 800  vehicles a year, but following the collapse of the socialist  bloc, the agreements ended abruptly.    As a result of the known external factors, Cuba's purchasing  power dropped from $8 billion in 1989 to $1.7 billion in 1993,  an amount that is insufficient to purchase very expensive buses  in the Western market.    Although it is not the most maneuverable vehicle for urban  transportation, the train-bus has been called on to play the  role of a surface metro to alleviate the heavy demand by the  people of Havana, although it will not be able to eliminate the  current severe shortage of buses. We cannot forget that the  service is also affected by spare parts shortages and fuel  limitations. The authorities therefore call on Cubans to  continue to use bicycles and animals in the country's interior.    In the middle of the acute Cuban urban transportation  limitations, the 200 train-buses that are to begin service in  Havana, plus an equal number of donated buses, constitute a  modest, albeit insufficient, injection into the service. But  this does not mean that the efforts to build these types of  vehicles in Cuba are any less valuable.</p>

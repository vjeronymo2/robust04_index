			<p><P> January 19, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WOMEN'S BASKETBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> SECOND-RANKED STANFORD ENDS UCLA'S STREAK, 98-80  </P> <P> The UCLA women's basketball team figured to come crashing back to Earth, and it  did.  </P> <P> Fresh from their most successful trip in five years, the Bruins played  second-ranked Stanford at Pauley Pavilion. The Cardinal opened a 10-point  halftime lead, then pulled away to a 98-80 victory Thursday night.  </P> <P> The Cardinal improved to 14-0 overall and 4-0 in the Pacific 10 Conference. The  Bruins, who had won four in a row on the road for the first time since the  1984-85 season, are 8-6 overall, 3-1 in the Pac-10.  </P> <P> Despite the loss, the Bruins have reason to feel optimistic -- they did better  than most against Stanford, which had been beating its opponents by an average  of more than 26 points.  </P> <P> The 80 points were the most against the Cardinal this year.  </P> <P> "We played as hard as I could have expected," UCLA Coach Billie Moore said. "If  we continue to play that way, we should do well."  </P> <P> Perhaps, but the Cardinal, whose play was described by Coach Tara VanDerveer as  "a little tentative at first," had little trouble doing what it does best --  scoring from the perimeter.  </P> <P> Forward Katy Steding made four of eight three-point shots and finished with 16  points. Guard Jennifer Azzi, Stanford's leading scorer, made three and finished  with 19.  </P> <P> "If you take away one side they just take (the ball) in and kick it back out to  the other," Moore said.  </P> <P> But balance has always been a key for the Cardinal.  </P> <P> Center Trisha Stevens, a 6-foot-3 junior, led four players in double figures  with a game-high 29 points, 20 in the first half. Freshman Val Whiting, who did  most of the damage from the inside, came off the bench to get 14 points and a  game-high eight rebounds.  </P> <P> The Cardinal outrebounded the Bruins, 42-38, and was better from the free-throw  line, making 20 of 35, all 14 in the first half.  </P> <P> The Bruins got 28 points from guard Rehema Stephens, 21 in the first half.  Sandra VanEmbricqs, before leaving midway through the second half because of a  sprained right ankle, added 14.  </P> <P> But the double-teaming of Azzi, the pressuring of Stanford's outside shooters  -- all served to leave Stephens open.  </P> <P> California 55, USC 50 -- Center Kesha Martin scored 14 points and grabbed six  rebounds to help the Bears hold off a second-half comeback by the Trojans at  USC.  </P> <P> After trailing by 15 points early in the game, USC rallied to 51-50 with a  minute left in the game before a basket by Laura Baker and two free throws by  Teresa Palmisano put the game away for California.  </P> <P> Freshman Joni Easterly led the Trojans with 17 points as USC fell to 1-3 in  Pac-10 play and 3-8 overall. Cal is 3-2 and 11-4.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn -- According to Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel,  Germany has to help secure world peace within the United Nations  without restrictions. At the annual meeting of the German  Society for Military Technology in Bonn, Kinkel said on  Wednesday [13 April] that in spite of all weaknesses, the United  Nations is the only global instrument of collective security.  It has the possibility to legitimize the use of force under  international law. The difficulties met by the United Nations,  for instance in Somalia, must not discourage the community.    The increasing responsibility that Germany faces requires an  appropriate German say as permanent member of the U.N. Security  Council, Kinkel pointed out. It is important that the resources  of the Atlantic Alliance can also be used in overcoming  international crises, if other possibilities fail. The Alliance  is now adapting the structure of its forces to these new tasks.    Klaus Naumann, the Bundeswehr Inspector General, made a  statement along the same line. NATO has confirmed its  willingness to help with United Nations or CSCE peacekeeping  operations. Parts of the military forces and installations of  NATO, and this includes the Bundeswehr, must be made available  for quick operations to prevent, curb, and to end conflicts.  The crisis reaction forces set up by the Bundeswehr must be  available quickly and be in a position "to be used also if the  outcome is uncertain."    Naumann described the overall development of the Bundeswehr  in a favorable light. It is not right that the armed forces are  not trained properly these days, he said. "There are dark  sides, no doubt, but there is also a lot of light," the general  said. The soldiers' devotion and willingness to work hard  "have increased impressively, and there is a willingness to take  risks and to do without amenities -- something that is quite  rare in our country," Naumann said.</p>

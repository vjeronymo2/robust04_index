			<p><P> August 9, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: IRVINE;  </P> <P> MOTORIST OFFERS UZI TO PAY GASOLINE BILL  </P> <P> Sometimes people don't have enough money to pay for gasoline at service  stations, a petroleum company official said. So they leave collateral such as  watches, wallets or jewelry until they can get the money to pay.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, a man driving a motor home offered a gas attendant at a Mobil  station something different -- an Uzi semiautomatic machine gun, Irvine police  said.  </P> <P> The attendant told Irvine police that the man, who had rung up a $23 debt for  gas, had no money and said that his credit card was overdrawn. After the  attendant decided not to accept a check, the man offered him the unloaded gun,  said Mobil Oil Corp. spokesman Jim Carbonetti, who would not identify the  attendant at the company's University Drive station.  </P> <P> The attendant on duty at the station Tuesday afternoon would not comment.  </P> <P> Carbonetti said the attendant called police to check the permit of the gun.  Irvine Police Sgt. Scott Cade said a check showed that the gun was legally  registered in the motorist's name.  </P> <P> So the gun owner drove off, leaving the attendant with the weapon. Carbonetti  said he hopes the gun soon will be reclaimed.  </P></p>

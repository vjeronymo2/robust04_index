The resumption of  sessions on 22 March was a reply of sorts to the warning in the  statements made by the U.S. ambassador in Port-au-Prince.  William Lacy Swing had hoped for a normalization of the Senate  with the presidency of Firmin Jean-Louis. But such was not the  case. Edner Jean reports:    [Begin recording] [Jean] The warning from the U.S. Embassy  clicked in the Senate -- but in a sense opposite to that  Ambassador Swing had perhaps hoped for. The office led by  Senator Bernard Sansaricq had not held sessions for three weeks,  giving priority to the negotiations of the Alliance [for  Parliamentarya Cohesion] which was trying to put an end to the  internal divergence.    The first effect of the U.S. Embassy press release was the  cessation of those talks. Alliance senators, divided on the  question of the two offices, had to go back to their camp, which  led Dejean Belizaire, president of this political bloc, to say  that the Alliance for Parliamentary Cohesion owes its existence  only to the firm determination of its members. He deplores what  he calls the brutal interference of the U.S. Embassy in Senate  affairs.    [Belizaire] If the international community has good reason  to  satisfy the whims of President Aristide and those of the  legislators close to him and encourages them to violate the  Governors Island accord, the New York pact, and the  Constitution, the Alliance for Parliamentary Cohesion owes its  existence only to the firm determination of its members to  defend the Constitution and to promote an ideal of peace,  justice, and democracy worthy of our ancestors' struggle to make  Haiti into a modern state, independent and sovereign. The  Alliance for Parliamentary Cohesion deplores the brutal  interference of the U.S. ambassador in the Senate's affairs.  [end recording]    [Jean] Besides those protests from the president of the  Alliance, the senators elected on 18 January, the main target of  Mr. Swing's statements, reiterated that they had returned to the  parliament to stay. Proof of their determination: In response to  the Embassy's press release, they oppose a draft resolution  severely castigating the office led by Firmin Jean-Louis. Let us  listen to Romel Manigat:    [Manigat] The senators are setting a dangerous precedent,  meaning the lack of respect for the decisions made by the  majority, and are introducing a subversive parliamentary  practice which consists of having recourse to foreign  interference in order to influence the legal decisions of a  legitimate power of a sovereign state each time the petty  interests of a minority are threatened. Considering that Senator  Firmin Jean-Louis, Julio Larossiliere, and Yvon Gislain failed  in their constitutional oath provided in Article 109;  considering that it is necessary to reinforce discipline in the  Senate and to protect the Haitian nation's superior interests, I  am requesting, if it please the honorable members of the Senate  Discipline and Ethics Committee, that you propose to the  senators a draft resolution requesting the application of the 4  March 1994 resolution suspending the senators judged guilty for  a four-month period with loss of their salary. [end recording]    [Jean] Another consequence of the press release from the  U.S.  Embassy is to remind the Bernard Sansaricq office that it had a  government to dismiss and another to constitute as soon as  possible. On that side, the senators from GARD [Action Group for  the Recovery and Defense of National Sovereignty] and of the  Alliance are mixing speed with haste. They do not agree on the  best ways to achieve their goal.    [Unidentified senator] Starting 22 March, Prime Minister  Robert Malval's resigning government is no longer authorized to  deal with the day-to-day matters of the Haitian state.    Article 2. The day-to-day matters of the Haitian state will  from now on be dealt with by the directors general of the  various ministries of the first rank below the resigning prime  minister and under the control of the legislative power.  [passage omitted].    [Jean] All things considered, despite the firm statements  and  the unreserved support of the Americans to the office led by  Firmin Jean-Louis, the control of the Senate of the Republic  seems to have definitively escaped the normalized office. In any  case, the contested senators elected on 18 January proved on 22  March their firm determination to challenge the international  community, which was expecting a regularization of the situation  in the Senate in order to vote on the legislators' plan.

			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / Japan to complain to EC over review of relations THE Japanese government, in an unusual show of anger, plans to send a letter to the EC this week to complain that a recent Commission review of relations was 'one-sided' and 'inappropriate'. The letter, still in draft form, uses far tougher language than the usually understated Japanese comments on foreign policy issues. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs argues that a Commission review of relations, delivered late last month, should have en-hanced the relationship between Brussels and Tokyo but instead was 'discouraging'. Japanese anger stems from the Commission's stress on economic issues and from the tone of the report, which, for example, says the EC 'must convince Japan' to cut its trade surplus and that direct talks may be needed to open its markets. The degree of Tokyo's irritation also reflects a deeper frustration with the Commission's policies and, in the view of Japanese officials, its neglect of opportunities to im-prove political and cultural ties. Japanese officials argue that bureaucrats in Brussels have not noted improvements in the country's bilateral links with individual EC states. Tokyo says the Commission report breaches the spirit of a Japan-EC Joint Declaration signed last year and intended to broaden the relationship beyond economic issues. The EC reluctantly signed the declaration, after first demanding that it be preceded by a more balanced trade relationship. 'Japan had expected the (Commission) communication to be a positive message, reflecting the on-going co-operation between Japan and the EC based on the Joint Declaration,' a senior foreign ministry official said. 'However, the communication raises the concern that it could rather be counter-productive in promoting the spirit of co-operation growing between Japan and the EC.' The Tokyo letter will suggest that parts of the document are 'revisionist' - implying that Japan is different from the rest of the world and needs to be treated as such.</p>

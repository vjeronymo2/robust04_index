			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Technology: Put designers in the driving seat - Technically Speaking Even while the mainstream UK motor industry was gazing happily into its cap at last week's Budget largesse, politicians and government apparatchiks began listening to another round of industry pleading. This time it came from a much smaller and highly specialised sector; but one which has been consistently successful and, in contrast to the rest of the motor industry, operates an external trade surplus out of all proportion to its size. The setting for this encounter was the Motor Industry Research Association's complex at Nuneaton, in Warwickshire. On Friday, government officials were given a lecture on the UK's independent automotive engineering and design sector, and why it deserves help from government. The field now employs around 5,000 designers and engineers whose talents lurk beneath the bodywork of a large number of cars from manufacturers more likely to be based in Germany, Japan or South Korea than in Longbridge or Luton. Though most have built strong technology bases, their culture still remains intuitive. This grade of talent has led British racing car designers and manufacturers to dominate the motor sport industry. In the past decade or so, in the eyes of many, UK designers and engineers have overtaken the Italians and are mounting a strong challenge to the best the Germans have on offer. (Indeed, if you could look down the employment roll of the design and engineering departments of Opel, Volkswagen/Audi and Porsche, British workers would be found in large numbers.) Yet despite this, UK consultancies have consistently been better at designing and engineering than at selling themselves. There are exceptions. John Shute, chairman and founder of Worthing-based International Automotive Design, gave high priority to becoming a master salesman, for example, in taking his company from a Pounds 250,0000 turnover in the late 1970s to its current status as a consultancy industry giant turning over many millions. The fact remains, however, that the sector's seeming inability to talk constructively within itself without prejudicing commercial confidentiality has led to many missed opportunities. Lots of plaudits, therefore, to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) in at last bringing the big companies together into a cohesive body, formally entitled the Design Engineering Group, and organising the Nuneaton meeting to tell politicians and senior civil servants about it. The teach-in was focused heavily on export prospects; not just for the consultancy industry, but for the UK equipment, component and other supply industries which stand to benefit from their efforts. For, as SMMT chief executive Sir Hal Miller pointed out, the designers of new vehicles can exert a significant influence on the eventual sourcing of tooling, component supplies, test equipment and so on. So what, specifically, does the industry want from Whitehall and Westminster? The shopping list is relatively modest: greater assistance through grants, tax relief or soft loans for the capital investment which many of the companies are making two or three times faster than much of the mainstream motor industry. The group would like greater official support, and better intelligence of official UK missions to overseas territories. It would like to see more flexible support in terms of the number of people qualifying for support on such missions, and more missions - and return missions  - to more places. Whichever government is in power after April 9, it should listen hard to a strong case.</p>

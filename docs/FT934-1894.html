			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Eurotunnel issue Shareholders of Eurotunnel, the company which operates the Channel tunnel, yesterday unanimously approved the issue of up to 192m 40p nominal shares. At present values they would be worth about Pounds 980m but Sir Alastair Morton, chairman, told an extraordinary meeting that there were no plans to issue shares to that value. The issue will take place some time before the official opening of the tunnel on May 6. Eurotunnel has said it needs a further Pounds 1bn of working capital on top of the existing capital of Pounds 8.9bn to meet its financial needs after the opening. It is to be raised about equally in equity and loans.</p>

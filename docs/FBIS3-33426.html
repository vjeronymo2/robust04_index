Deputy Government  Minister Adolfo Reyes explains the agreements reached tonight  inside the National Palace. Can you explain the agreements to  our listeners?    [Reyes] It is fortunate that once again through dialogue--  without any violence and in compliance with the law and  Constitution--we have done our work. We have met with the five  Fenasep leaders who are here in my office. We are drafting a  document that includes a point on the resumption of talks; this  will take place on 1 March, starting at 1500, when the president  will hold a special meeting with them. Other points are  nonviolence and a revision of dialogue. They have maintained  their request for a 40-percent salary increase.    In addition to the people gathered outside the main square,  there was no violence, fortunately. The police are remaining  watchful, protecting the people, and preventing incidents. When  we sign this document, which we hope will be in the next 10  minutes, the union leaders promised us they will withdraw  peacefully. We will meet again on 1 March at 1500. That is all  I have to say.    [Guatemala City Cadena de Emisoras Unidas in Spanish at 0155  GMT on 24 February cites Fenasep leader Armando Sanchez as  saying: "We are going to proceed to leave the building, because  we reached an agreement to meet in a new process of negotiation  with the government on 1 March."]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin today told the Knesset  Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee that he is ready for a  greater withdrawal on the Golan than that recommended by the  IDF's [Israel Defense Forces] General Staff. The prime  minister's statement was made in reply to a question from  Knesset Member [MK] Beni Begin.    Our correspondent Hayim Hecht reports that the prime  minister  stressed that the working paper he received from Major General  Ilan Biran did not refer to a total IDF withdrawal from the  Golan.    Also at today's Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense  Committee  session, Yitzhaq Rabin, prime minister and defense minister,  said the regular troops are in a difficult situation, because  all the men are tied up in operational activity in Judaea,  Samaria, and the Gaza Strip. Rabin noted that instead of the  planned six months of training, the regular troops were barely  receiving three months, and if the situation continues, the  level of preparedness will be affected. The prime minister  added that there are many friction-prone sites in Hebron, which  are liable to lead to a conflagration. For that reason, the best  units are tied up in that location.    [A related report by Tamar Asalem on Tel Aviv IDF Radio in  Hebrew at 1400 GMT on 19 April adds: "The prime minister said  that Jordan may not attend the Washington talks because of the  naval blockade imposed by the United States on al-'Aqabah. He  believes, however, that an agreement with Jordan will be  possible only after one is achieved with Syria.    ["Discussing the Syrian issue, the prime minister stated  that  there is a principle of international presence on the Golan, but  he did not specify the nature of the presence. The prime  minister added that all decisions would be made by the political  echelons, and all publicized documents merely represent the  process of data gathering and preparatory work.    ["MK Beni Begin told the prime minister that he understood  that the General Staff recommendations specified a smaller  withdrawal area than Rabin found acceptable. Rabin's simple  reply: Yes. There is no argument that in the military sense,  the present line is better than any line lying farther to the  west, but our work is based on a certain political reality."]</p>

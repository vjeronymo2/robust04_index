			<p><P> March 20, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> COUNTY IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> BURBANK;  </P> <P> RECALL PETITIONS GAIN APPROVAL  </P> <P> Petitions seeking the recall of two Burbank city councilmen accused of favoring  developers were approved Monday. Circulators have 120 days to gather the  signatures of about 9,000 registered voters before the issue can be placed on  the November ballot.  </P> <P> The attempt to recall Michael Hastings and Thomas Flavin was begun in February  by three residents upset over what they called "uncontrolled development, greed  and political giveaways. We have found overwhelming support for the recall and  dissatisfaction with the way the city government is going in Burbank," said Ted  McConkey, who along with two others filed the petitions. "People are just fed  up. They have seen their community changed from primarily single-family  residences . . . to multiple apartment units." The recall petitions must be  signed by 20% -- or 8,720 -- of Burbank's 43,600 registered voters.  </P></p>

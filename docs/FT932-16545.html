			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / International Company News: Snecma loss deepens SNECMA, France's state-controlled aero-engine maker, saw its consolidated loss deepen last year to FFr794m (Dollars 146m) from FFr68m in 1991, writes David Buchan in Paris. The company said the figures reflected 'the global crisis in the aviation market, and include provisions for restructuring the workforce and depreciation of shares in certain subsidiaries'. The group announced last month that turnover in 1992 fell to FFr23bn, against FFr 23.9bn the previous year. The value of its order book dropped by FFr 3bn by the end of last year, from FFr 7.3bn a year earlier.</p>

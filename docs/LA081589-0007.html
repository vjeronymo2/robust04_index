			<p><P> August 15, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART FUNDS AND CENSORSHIP  </P> <P> Actor and writer Eric Bogosian ("When Politics Campaigns in the Arts,  Creativity Ends," Opinion, Aug. 6) made a forceful case for getting politics  out of NEA grants. Alas, he did not go far enough and demand total separation  of arts and state.  </P> <P> Where did Bogosian go wrong? NEA grants are justified, he wrote, because "we  voted for people who voted for it." By Bogosian's logic, he then apparently  thinks a $300- billion defense budget is justified because "we voted for people  who voted for it."  </P> <P> His greatest fallacy is to beg the question of which "art" and "artists" will  get endowment money and which will be denied it. Bogosian scorns the idea that  the "Average Joe," taxed to pay for this, should have any voice in the matter;  no, this should be left to experts, to the NEA's "jury of peers." Who decides  who these "peers" are? Political appointees. So politics was helping support  art that turned the American flag into a floor mat, homoerotic art or an image  of Christ in a jar of urine.  </P> <P> Where are tax dollars being spent by NEA to support artists whose work  criticizes the ruling left-liberal Establishment ideology that dominates the  intellectual and artistic community?  </P> <P> Where is the variety, balance, diversity of views? When one young Chicago  artist did a painting that poked fun at the city's late liberal mayor, Harold  Washington, Chicago government officials illegally confiscated his artwork from  the gallery and destroyed it. No Eric Bogosian spoke up to criticize this  Nazi-like act of censorship by liberals.  </P> <P> We can call the NEA's cynical leftward political manipulation of the arts many  things, but let's not pretend that it is healthy for artistic creativity, or  that it is freedom. NEA's purse strings have become a leash by which artists  are trained to be good little lackeys for the left. The only way to liberate  our artists is to end all government involvement in funding or otherwise  controlling the arts.  </P> <P> LOWELL PONTE  </P> <P> Carlsbad  </P></p>

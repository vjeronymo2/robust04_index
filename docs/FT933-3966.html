			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / International Company News: Earnings at Anglovaal advance 19% LOWER interest and tax charges and an increased contribution from associates helped Anglovaal Industries lift earnings per share by 19 per cent, to 1,083 cents from 907 cents, in the year to June. The dividend was increased by 18 per cent, to 195 cents from 165 cents per share. The group made attributable profits of R343.7m (Dollars 101.1m) against R270.6m last time, on a turnover of R8.3bn, up from R7.96bn.

			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / International Company News: Takeover saves Peoples Jewellers PEOPLES Jewellers, Canada's biggest jewellery chain, has been saved through a last-minute takeover by its chairman Mr Duff Scott, a Toronto businessman and former head of the Toronto Stock Exchange. He is backed by the Bank of Nova Scotia. A new company headed by Mr Scott is taking over Peoples' assets, including about 200 stores and involving about 1,500 jobs. The founding Gerstein family will end all connections with Peoples. A wing of the Gersteins blocked a financial restructuring of Peoples last Thursday, forcing the Ontario court to put it into bankruptcy. On Friday, the bank and Mr Scott reached agreement on a CDollars 70m (USDollars 54.7m) takeover with court approval. The bank, owed more than CDollars 100m by the old Peoples, is financing the purchase by the new company and has extended a new Dollars 30m line of credit. About 12 stores have been shut, but the rest will remain in operation. The defeat of the old restructuring, however, means common shareholders and unsecured creditors will not get their money back.</p>

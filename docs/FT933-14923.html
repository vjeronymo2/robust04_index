			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / Survey of Belgium (1): Euro-devotee calls the tune - As it assumes the presidency of the European Community this month, Belgium is embarked on a course towards a more federalist structure at home. It sees Europe as an anchor for its own political and economic restructuring IT IS HARD to imagine any European Community country other than Belgium decreeing a reduction in jail sentences for convicted prisoners to mark its assumption this month of the EC's presidency. Idiosyncratic though the gesture seems, it illustrates the importance Belgium attaches to Europe, and to its place in it. Belgium, always in the vanguard of Euro-federalism and in the throes of settling down to a more federalist structure at home, takes over management of the Community after a year which has seen a backlash against the Maastricht treaty on political, economic and monetary union, in a number of European countries. It intends to set a new tone, banking on ratification of the treaty in the UK and Germany by around September. Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the burly Flemish Christian Democrat who heads Belgium's four-party Centre-Left coalition, repeated in several eve-of-presidency interviews that over the next six months he is setting the EC's compass to go 'not a step further than Maastricht, but towards all of Maastricht'. Mr Dehaene, is quite likely to call a special autumn summit after treaty ratification, with Franco-German backing. The intention would be to relaunch the EC: the practical goal would be to agree the rules, management and location for the European Monetary Institute. This is the precursor to the European Central Bank envisaged for later this decade under the plans for economic and monetary union (Emu) which lie at the heart of Maastricht. It must be in place by next January to launch the second stage of Emu. Mr Dehaene and his colleagues remain convinced of the need for Maastricht and the viability of Emu. They are determined to use their presidency to raise the EC flag from political half-mast, where it has scarcely fluttered for the past year, as first the British and then the Danes held the Community presidency. They see Europe as an anchor for Belgium's own federalism and as offering a pretext for re-ordering its economy, especially to put its public finances right. Mr Dehaene told the Spanish daily, El Pais, recently that Belgium's European and domestic federalisms 'are complementary and indissolubly linked'. Yet, Belgian politicians often give the impression that they believe their linguistically fragmented country - divided between French-speaking Wallonia, Dutch-speaking Flanders and polyglot Brussels - can only survive as a nation-state within firm supranational structures provided by growing EC integration. That is 'taking it a step too far,' counters Mr Willy Claes, foreign minister and a Flemish Socialist, but he happily acknowledges that, 'we have always been in favour of transfers of national sovereignty towards a supranational body,' and that 'there is a link going in the other direction'. Under a seven-party deal in May, Belgium devolved national sovereignty downwards to an extent that will make it one of the most completely federalised states in the EC after its next elections. The state will retain control of foreign policy and defence, justice, taxation and social security, but other matters, from the environment to education, and from trade to transport, will be the responsibility of the three regional executives and their directly elected parliaments. Securing decisions in Belgium will then become almost as arduous as getting the EC 12 to agree, but, local politicians emphasise, they will have a firm consensus underpinning them, and a comfortable EC umbrella above. It will, moreover, by then have an advisory committee of the regions, an arrangement which Belgium is convinced is the embryo of a 'Europe des regions'. That is one reason why widespread predictions in May that Belgium was heading for a Czech/Slovak-style divorce appear alarmist. A provocative statement at the time by Mr Luc Van den Brande, Christian Democrat chief of the Flemish executive, predicted that federalisation would lead to complete autonomy for Flanders within the decade. Recent opinion polls, however, make it clear that only 6 per cent of Belgians, and even only 9 per cent of Flemings, favour separation. The majority backs a federalist solution. So-called Belgo-Belge scraps between Dutch and French-speakers are increasingly less melodramatic, partly because of this, partly because politicians from all parties are deeply unpopular - and want to stave off elections as long as possible - and also because Belgium has moved into recession. In the view of leading economists, such as Mr Peter Praet of Generale de Banque, the separatism debate has the merit of focusing attention on Belgium's structural shortcomings, such as its fast-rising social security bill, in both Flanders and Wallonia. The government is struggling against a serious imbalance in public finances, with a budget deficit of 6.9 per cent last year and a government debt overhang equivalent to nearly 125 per cent of national output. Excluding interest on the debt, the budget is in surplus. The government is poised to stem part of the interest payment haemorrhage by refinancing short-term foreign borrowings into long-term debt denominated in Belgian francs. That should produce a sizeable reward - perhaps a 1.5 percentage points of gross domestic product saving on the interest bill - for its three-year old franc fort policy of tying the franc to the D-Mark. Convinced it can reach the 3 per cent of GDP target budget deficit for Emu laid down by Maastricht, Mr Dehaene pushed through a BFr110bn tax and cuts package in March, at the cost of the near-collapse of his government. The government also expects BFr25bn this year and next from a four-year privatisation drive which is expected to net BFr70bn. This will put up for sale assets ranging from the CGER/ASLK banking and insurance group, to Belgacom, the state telecommunications company. Though Belgium is as much out of step with the Emu criteria as the UK, Italy or Spain, the Belgian franc became a refuge currency, in the currency mayhem of last autumn, and did not have to leave the exchange rate mechanism, the EC's currency grid, or devalue. This was a tribute to the credibility of its monetary policy, and Belgium's perceived status as part of the hard core EC currency zone, encompassing Germany, France and the Benelux countries. With other partners gaining competitive advantage through devaluation, Belgium has to stay within this hard core, to which it sells three fifths of its exports, but it is failing to bear down on indexed and inflationary wage settlements which are blunting its competitive edge. It has opted instead to use revenue from new taxes on non-industrial fuel users to cut employers' social security payments in the exports sector. This will not be enough, however, to close a widening wage gap with its main partners. In Belgium, these strains strengthen the attraction of Emu's goal of a single currency, and even of an earlier locking of parities between the hard core countries, once Maastricht is ratified. The latter idea, canvassed by Euro-federalists, is that a fuite en avant by the stronger economies would establish a target at which weaker partners could aim later. 'I'm in favour of that,' says Mr Alfons Verplaetse, the respected governor of Belgium's central bank, 'but I don't think it will happen. This recession could be longer than we think.' Mr Praet says locking parities would be dangerous while there was uncertainty about what was going to happen in a year's time in Germany. 'When growth resumes, maybe we can try something more audacious,' he adds. But the longer-term goal of full EC monetary union still looks like a haven to Belgium. As Mr Claes expresses it: 'When there are monetary changes in Washington we feel it across the European continent. Are we still not ready to face up to the lessons of the monetary instability of last year, which not one member state was able to resist by itself?'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Maria Helena Tachinardi from Brasilia] </F>   [Text] Romania will open a consulate in Sao Paulo, and  Brazil will also establish a consulate in a Romanian city that  has yet to be decided. Besides agreeing on this, on 11 May both  countries signed an agreement providing for bilateral political  consultations.    Romanian Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu, who is making a  state visit to Brazil, met with President Itamar Franco on 11  May and expressed his country's interest in signing another two  agreements -- one on the promotion and protection of  investments, and another one to do away with double taxation.    Two business deals between both countries that are deemed  promising are the supply of railroad ties and equipment for the  Soybean Railroad [Ferrovia da Soja] which is currently under  construction, financed by businessman Olacyr de Moraes; and the  export of the SIAF [Integrated System of Financial  Administration] of the Federal Data Processing Service (Serpro)  for accounting and budget control. According to a source close  to Itamaraty, the IMF has recommended the SIAF. This system has  already been bought by Angola and Paraguay. The problem Romania  encounters in purchasing this system is lack of financing.    According to Vacaroiu, his country is interested in mounting  an assembly line for ARO-24 all-terrain vehicles. This business  venture is being undertaken with the Brazilian company Embramil  [Brazilian Missile Company], which is interested in the transfer  of Romanian technology for the manufacturing of different types  of bombs.    The prime minister announced that the Romanian company Rocar  is also interested in manufacturing utility vehicles in the  Manaus free zone. Rocar would also like to supply ambulances to  Rio de Janeiro State, which has yet to obtain the funds for this  business transaction.    Vacaroiu will visit Petrobras [Brazilian Petroleum  Corporation] and the Rio Doce Valley Company today, and will  have a luncheon with businessmen from the Rio de Janeiro Trade  Association. Tomorrow he will travel to Sao Paulo, where he  will visit Embraer [Brazilian Aeronautics Company] and Fiesp  [Sao Paulo State Federation of Industries]. Romania intends to  purchase planes without engines from Embraer. The engines would  be supplied by a Romanian company, which manufactures the  product under license from a foreign company.</p>

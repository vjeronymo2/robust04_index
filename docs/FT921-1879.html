			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Olympia &amp; York banks to meet over debts BANKERS to Olympia &amp; York, the world's biggest property developer, are preparing for talks to consider the secretive group's debts estimated to be at least CDollars 10bn (Pounds 4.8bn). Banks from around the world are expected to be called to a meeting within weeks to seek a way to support the transatlantic property group built up by the Canadian Reichmann brothers. O&amp;Y, whose flagship developments include the World Financial Centre in New York and Canary Wharf in London, has seen its income squeezed by the continuing recession in North America and Britain. Falling property values have made banks increasingly nervous. The group's debts are a closely guarded secret but Canadian real estate analysts estimate its debt at between CDollars 10bn and CDollars 20bn. A decision to call the meeting lies with the group's main bankers, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) and Citibank of the US. Others are expecting a formal invitation to attend. Mr Paul Reichmann, O&amp;Y's president, is a director of CIBC, but the bank declined yesterday to comment on any aspect of its business dealings with O&amp;Y. An O&amp;Y spokesman said: 'There are ongoing discussions with individual banks.' He said no meeting had taken place or been scheduled but would not comment further. Any restructuring of O&amp;Y's debt by the group's bankers would amount to one of the largest financial operations of its kind in recent years. A comparable operation was the USDollars 8bn debt restruct-uring of Mr Rupert Murdoch's media empire in early 1991. One banker said of the group's cash squeeze: 'It has been taking a lot of money at a time when the businesses are not generating cash. Also, there's no new money to pay today's bills.' He added that bankers are not content to rely only on the group's various properties as securities for their loans. 'It's fine to own a piece of real estate, but it's not cash.' O&amp;Y is already understood to have arranged a loan with a number of its bankers to replace two short-term financing arrangements totalling CDollars 800m. The company has already refinanced about CDollars 380m, and is now in talks with the banks to replace the rest with more stable, longer-term loans. O&amp;Y's problems are due in large part to the resources it has been forced to devote to the Pounds 1.3bn Canary Wharf project in the London Docklands, Europe's largest office project. The company was successful at signing up tenants before the completion of the first phase of 4.4m sq ft but, in the past 18 months, as the recession in the UK has deepened, the rate of lettings has slowed sharply. Forty per cent of the existing space remains unlet. A further 6m sq ft are due to be completed by 1997 although it is unclear whether the whole project will be finished. This week the company withdrew a Pounds 215m financing package to attract private investors into Canary Wharf. The company is also under pressure in North America, where it is fighting to keep some of its tenants in cities which have sharply increased vacancy rates. Guillotine victim, Weekend V</p>

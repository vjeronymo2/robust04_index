			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / World Trade News: UK ousted as Malaysia partner The Malaysian Resources Corporation, complying with a government ban on contracts for British companies, yesterday named Canada's Hydro Quebec International to replace Britain's National Grid as its partner in a power venture, Corporation officials said they would own 55 per cent of the project to install 500KV power lines for the utility Tenaga Nasional. Permodalan Nasional, the national equity corporation, would own the remaining 45 per cent. National Grid becomes the second British company to suffer after EPE Power, an electrical equipment supplier, said this month it was dropping Rolls-Royce Industrial Power as a joint venture partner. Although the ban only covers government contracts, it has been interpreted to include companies, such as Tenaga, in which the government holds a majority stake.</p>

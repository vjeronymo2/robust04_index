			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Germany to keep monetary policy tight THE BUNDESBANK said yesterday it was determined to keep monetary policy tight in the face of inflationary pressures. A 'premature' easing could endanger the return to price stability in Germany, it said. In its monthly report, the German central bank said recent wage deals were still too high in the light of reduced economic growth, although the average 5.5 per cent rise in key industrial sectors was less than last year's 7 per cent. Unit labour costs would rise by about 4 per cent this year, a level 'that is not reconcilable with the aim of price stability', it said. The Bundesbank held out the hope that wage deals would be more moderate next year, noting that the settlement in the engineering industry included a lower increase for 1993 than for this year. Last year's wage rises probably affected the competitiveness of German exporters, with foreign trade performance tending to damp the fairly positive economic trend, it said. Gross national product in west Germany was 2 per cent higher in the first quarter than in the last quarter of 1991 on a seasonally adjusted basis. This partly reflected mild winter weather and would not be repeated in the second three months, but 'the economy is clearly headed upwards'. Although inflation had retreated from its March peak of a 4.8 per cent annual rate to 4.6 per cent in May, the bank said it was still too high. Excluding energy prices and higher consumer taxes, prices were up by a more modest 3.5 per cent. But, in the service and construction sectors, the rise was about 6 per cent. 'This shows that considerable inflationary tensions still exist,' the bank said. Mistaken economic and wage policies could cause such pressures to spread to other sectors. The bank said that last December's half point rise in interest rates - to 8 per cent for the discount rate and 9.75 per cent for the Lombard rate - had been urgently needed to combat inflation. A continued loss of monetary stability would endanger growth and employment as well as the process of integrating east Germany. The D-Mark's international role also demanded inflationary vigilance. 'The decisions at Maastricht have strengthened the need to cut the German inflation rate in view of European monetary integration,' the Bundesbank report said.

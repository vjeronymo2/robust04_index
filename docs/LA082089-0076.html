			<p><P> August 20, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHRISTIAN POLICE SERGEANT SEES SATAN AS AN ADVERSARY IN CRIME  </P> <P> First came the 18-year-old La Puente machinist who shot himself with a  .22-caliber rifle in 1984 while a tape of Ozzy Osbourne's "Diary of a Madman"  blasted heavy metal anthems from his stereo.  </P> <P> The next year, a partially burned voodoo doll with pins in its groin and heart  was found nailed to the back door of a Baldwin Park dressmaking shop.  </P> <P> Then, in 1987, seven people were arrested for ransacking an El Monte warehouse,  where they painted "Suicidal Death Tribe" in giant letters on the wall and  jammed a dead rat through the plaster.  </P> <P> Just last month, a Covina teen-ager pleaded guilty to charges of animal cruelty  after he and a friend were accused of mutilating several cats and using the  blood to scrawl "666" on an elementary school wall.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Troubled Youths  </P> <P> Perhaps, they were all just troubled youths hoping to shock the rest of the  world into paying them attention. But Randy Emon did not think so.  </P> <P> Emon, a Baldwin Park police sergeant with 18 years on the force, saw a darker  side to those incidents, a suspicion that has launched him on a bizarre and  spiritually turbulent journey into the world of occult-related crime.  </P> <P> In the process, Emon has become a leading authority among a small but growing  number of occult specialists whose expertise in such practices as satanism,  witchcraft and Santeria is increasingly in high demand.  </P> <P> Through his course at Rio Hondo College and consulting jobs, he estimates he  has trained more than 600 California police officers in recognizing ritualistic  crimes. Adding church and civic groups, he figures that at least 20,000 people  have heard him lecture about animal mutilation, necrophilia and human  sacrifice.  </P> <P> Yet Emon, a "born-again" Christian and father of three, has also been beset by  personal conflict as he has immersed himself in a subject that is the  antithesis of all he believes.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Unusual Events  </P> <P> Emon, 36, says his children have been possessed by demons just before he  conducted seminars on the occult. He says his wife has broken out in rashes as  she approached the boxes of demonic memorabilia that he stores in his garage.  </P> <P> And he says a pentagram, the five-pointed star often used as a symbol by  satanists, once mysteriously appeared etched in his carpet, disappearing only  after he dropped to his knees in prayer.  </P> <P> "You feel this stuff getting to you sometimes," Emon said. "I have seen  firsthand the power that's there. I suppose, if I didn't feel a real calling to  learn more about this, there would be a lot less pressure in my life."  </P> <P> These are statements that are sure to raise the eyebrows of skeptics. Warnings  about supernatural forces and gruesome rituals often seem overly alarmist, if  not flat-out fantasy.  </P> <P> But with the grisly drug-cult murders in Matamoros, Mexico, earlier this year  and the self-styled satanism allegedly practiced by Night Stalker suspect  Richard Ramirez, such notions have slowly begun to creep into the public  consciousness.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Occult-Related Crimes  </P> <P> Some experts now say they hear of so many cases involving blood-drained  animals, abused children and dismembered corpses that they believe occult  rituals will be the crime of the '90s.  </P> <P> "When you measure it against the tremendous gang and narcotic problems we have,  it's still not a major issue," said Detective Patrick Metoyer, a 23-year  veteran of the Los Angeles Police Department and a widely recognized expert in  the field. "But it's something we had better be concerned with. Occult activity  is definitely on the rise."  </P> <P> In the San Gabriel Valley, as elsewhere in the state, documentation is still  usually piecemeal and anecdotal. No police department has an officer assigned  exclusively to such crimes. And authorities readily concede that they are not  always equipped to decipher the clues left behind from ritualistic acts.  </P> <P> That is where Emon steps in.  </P> <P> When two decapitated chickens were discovered last month next to several small  wax figurines, coconut pieces and shreds of colored cloth near a dry riverbed  in South El Monte, it was Emon who determined that they were the remnants of a  ritual from the Afro-Cuban religion, Santeria.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Legal Sacrifice  </P> <P> No crime was committed because the animals appeared to have been slaughtered  humanely, with a quick and clean cut, said Dan Sturkie, district supervisor for  county Animal Care and Control.  </P> <P> "But prior to this, it would have looked to us just like someone's leftover  dinner," Sturkie said. "Now we're recognizing things more often for what they  are."  </P> <P> The same was true for Covina police who last April arrested two youths, ages 16  and 17, for allegedly mutilating at least seven cats, scrawling satanic symbols  with the blood and leaving the tails in a box at the Covina Post Office.  </P> <P> "I guess the kids were able to convince the D.A. that it was all a joke," said  Glenn Myers, the Covina crime prevention officer. "But it was still pretty  scary behavior. Randy was able to look at some of the stuff and let us know  that we had a real problem."  </P> <P> Emon, an athletic, neatly groomed man who belongs to Cops for Christ, traces  his connection with the occult back to 1985, shortly after Ramirez was captured  and his obsession with satanic imagery revealed.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Incident in Church  </P> <P> That same week, Emon said he saw a demon possess a woman during a Sunday church  service, watching as her face grew contorted and she repeated in a deep  masculine voice, "No, I don't want to leave."  </P> <P> From that moment on, he said, he felt "a nudge from up there" to learn  everything there was to know about the occult. He soon realized it would be a  road paved with tension.  </P> <P> One night, just before he was going to conduct a seminar, his eldest son  developed a high fever as he lay on his bed, arms extended to the ceiling,  crying, "Get away, get away."  </P> <P> Emon said he placed the boy in cool water and prayed for him until the fever  subsided.  </P> <P> Five minutes later, his younger son screamed from his bedroom that he could not  see. Emon said he wrapped his arms around him and prayed until his son's vision  returned.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Not Mere Chance'  </P> <P> "I realized many of the events which had occurred . . . were not mere chance,  but the work of Satan and his demons striving to discourage my research," he  later wrote in a Christian magazine.  </P> <P> Emon's experiences, however, are not shared by all in his field.  </P> <P> "My personal feeling is that's pretty far out," said Investigator Sandi  Gallant, the San Francisco Police Department's occult expert. "I've certainly  never been haunted."  </P> <P> Metoyer, the LAPD's expert, said he has been invited to attend satanic rituals  but was not impressed.  </P> <P> "I didn't see a darn thing," he said. "I didn't hear diddly-squat. I didn't see  any devil come down."  </P> <P> A professor emeritus of religion at USC even compared Satan sleuths such as  Emon to those who conducted the communist witch-hunts during the red-baiting  days of Sen. Joseph McCarthy.  </P> <P> "You interpret what you find in the light of the glasses you look through,"  said Gerald Larue, who was named "Humanist of the Year" for 1989 by the  American Humanist Assn. "You become obsessed with the enemy. And for a  Christian, the enemy is Satan."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Spiritual Encounters  </P> <P> But an occult expert at the Christian Research Institute in Irvine said  experiences such as Emon's were genuine spiritual encounters that were typical  of devout Christians who trespass in the demonic realm.  </P> <P> "Sure, these things are nothing short of the bizarre," said Craig Hawkins, a  research consultant at the institute. "But for a person who believes that there  really is a spiritual realm, that kind of thing is not impossible at all.  That's what happens when you enter the domain of the demonic."  </P> <P> Some say Emon's deep faith even enhances his expertise. George Belanger, a  former drummer for the occult-rock band Christian Death, said Emon was  instrumental in helping him leave satanism behind.  </P> <P> "A lot of Christians, when they find out you're from an occult background, they  freak out," said Belanger, now a "born-again" Christian who lives in Glendora.  "But Randy was very sympathetic, caring and loving. I had a lot of painful  memories and he had a real soft ear."  </P> <P> Emon, who is also director of the Christian Occult Investigators Network, a  nonprofit research group in West Covina, says he works hard to keep his  religious views from interfering with his police work.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Freedom of Worship  </P> <P> He stresses First Amendment rights in all of his seminars, cautioning other  officers that satanists -- unless their rituals break the law -- have the same  freedom to worship as anyone else.  </P> <P> His supervisor, Baldwin Park Police Chief Richard A. Hoskin, said that there  have been no conflicts, but he acknowledged that the subject can get touchy.  </P> <P> "It's a sensitive issue," Hoskin said. "As far as being an embarrassment, it  hasn't really come to that. But we have tried to suggest to him that he not  become actively involved in that while he's on duty."  </P> <P> On- or off-duty, however, it's hard for Emon to escape the occult. The 30 to 40  boxes of artifacts from his investigations piled in the garage of his suburban  home serve as constant reminders of his encounters with the demonic.  </P> <P> He has photos of decapitated pigs, record albums from heavy metal bands, such  as Venom and Slayer, literary staples such as Anton LaVey's "Satanic Bible" and  comic books with ads for "100 Ready-to-Use Mystic Chants."  </P> <P> He has a Ouija Board that he says sent mystical messages to a teen-ager to take  his own life. He has a cardboard shrine splattered with blood. And he has a  small squirrel tail that he says was cut from the animal in a satanic ritual.  </P> <P> "Randy is a unique individual," said Tony Palmer, whose Walnut-based firm,  International Law Enforcement Training &amp; Consulting, hires Emon to teach  occult seminars to police officers. "He lives this stuff. In many different  ways."  </P></p>

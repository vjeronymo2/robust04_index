			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / Midwest hit by further rains NEW DOWNPOURS have hit the Midwest of the US and threaten to drive the flooded Mississippi river to a new crest next week. The waters seemed to be subsiding for the swollen river has dropped by a few inches from the record crest of 47 feet reached last week on the St Louis flood gauge - three feet above the level reached in 1973, the year of the last great flood to hit the region. But the new rains are forecast to produce yet another record, at 48 feet, this weekend, threatening far greater damage. Besides overflowing some earth levees that barely withstood the last crest, the Mississippi is also expected to break through more levees weakened by weeks of waterlogging. Tributaries such as the Missouri, Illinois, Des Moines, Kansas and Platte rivers have also flooded and are wreaking havoc in parts of eight states. Government estimates of the damage caused by the flooding have now topped Dollars 10bn, much of it to farmers who have been unable to plant in rainsoaked ground, even when it is not under water. Mr Mike Espy, agriculture secretary, said yesterday that the administration, which last week asked Congress for Dollars 2.48bn in flood aid, would now ask for Dollars 5bn. The flood bill was held up in the House of Representatives last week after a dispute over whether it should be added to the deficit or met by offsetting spending cuts. It is expected to pass this week. Meanwhile, drought in south-eastern states may be more damaging to US agriculture because this affects a wider area than the flooding in the Midwest. Flood deaths in the Midwest, however, could now start to climb because flash floods can be triggered by as little as two inches of rain, let alone the 7-10 inch downpours that some parts of the region have suffered during the last week.</p>

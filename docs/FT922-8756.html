			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / World Trade News: US steel bid to head off dumping cases US STEEL traders will today urge the government to resume multilateral steel talks in the hope of heading off a huge filing of dumping cases. Mr John Griffin, president of the American Institute for International Steel, is asking the US to work 'vigorously' to back the talks, which broke down on March 31 without an agreement on limiting trade-distorting practices. Institute members, which import and export steel, fear retaliation by nations hit by anti-dumping or countervailing duties. The six largest US integrated steel producers said yesterday they were starting 'consultations' with the US government before cases were filed against 'unfairly traded' steel products. The companies, USX-US Steel, Bethlehem, LTV, National, Inland and Armco, said a decision on the timing of the filing was expected soon. Reports are circulating in Washington that 87 complaints have been prepared against 20 nations for alleged dumping of flat-rolled and plate steel. Bethlehem and CR&amp;I Steel have filed petitions alleging dumping of steel rail from Japan, Luxembourg and the UK. The two contend that because of the dumping, the domestic share of the US steel rail market has fallen by an average 9 per cent a year from 1989 to 1991. They are seeking duties of almost 40 per cent on steel rail from Japan, 24.4 per cent on rail from Luxembourg, and 50.6 per cent on UK rail. Mr Griffin says US steel exports last year rose by 47.5 per cent (2m tonnes), while imports fell by 1.4m tonnes, a trend continuing in January and February this year. 'In these circumstances, injury will be difficult to prove for US mills,' he said. The EC has urged American companies not to return to 'practices of harassment bitterly experienced by US trading partners in 1982 and 1984' and asked the US government to be 'severe in the examination of anti-dumping'.</p>

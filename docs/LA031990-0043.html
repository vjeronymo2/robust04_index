			<p><P> March 19, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAPANESE SAVE MORE THAN IN ANY OTHER NATION  </P> <P> The average Japanese family had stashed away $86,250 in savings as of 1989,  confirming Japan's place as one of the world's most frugal countries, the  government has announced.  </P> <P> The average family added 15.3% to its already large nest egg in 1989, the  highest growth rate since 1979, the Management and Coordination Agency reported  Friday.  </P> <P> The United States has complained in trade negotiations that Japan's high  savings rate is a contributing factor to the massive U.S. trade deficit with  Japan, which stood at $49 billion in 1989.  </P> <P> Japan's household savings rate, or the percentage of annual income an average  family puts into savings, stood at 15.1% in 1989, one of the highest in the  world.  </P> <P> By comparison, Americans saved on average only 6.3% of their income in 1989.  The British saved 4.9%, and French and West Germans saved about 12%.  </P> <P> The household savings rate does not include the value of the family home or  other real estate.  </P> <P> The Americans argue the Japanese tendency to save a large portion of their  income keeps their spending down. The result is they buy fewer goods, including  imported goods from the United States.  </P> <P> The Japanese have turned the argument around, saying the United States could  improve its economic situation if it saved more.  </P> <P> They argue a high savings rate makes more money available for investments and  drives interest rates lower.  </P> <P> Both countries have listed savings rates as a structural barrier to balanced  trade in the ongoing trade negotiations dubbed the Structural Impediments  Initiative.  </P></p>

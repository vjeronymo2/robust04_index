			<p><P> March 30, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SAILOR IN BATTERED CRAFT FAILS TO BREAK N.Y.-TO-S.F. RECORD  </P> <P> A French stunt man failed to set a 'round-the-Horn record today but slowly  continued to work his way toward San Francisco in seeking to become the first  solo sailor to make the 14,000-mile voyage from New York.  </P> <P> Philippe Monnet, 30, was unable to reach the Golden Gate before 7:42 a.m.,  leaving intact the record of 80 days, 20 hours set Feb. 12 by Warren Luhrs and  crew in the 60-foot Thursday's Child for sailing from New York to San Francisco  around Cape Horn. The record had previously stood for more than a century.  </P> <P> Backers who were in radio contact with Monnet estimated that his 60-foot boat  would make San Francisco later today.  </P> <P> Monnet set out from New York Jan. 8 at a record pace but suffered a series of  mishaps this week. He was sailing with a jury-rigged forestay, which he  refastened after it broke late Monday afternoon. To repair the wire line, he  had to use a pulley and sling to hoist himself up the mast as it pitched back  and forth. Monnet had no gloves to use, and suffered numerous cuts as he tried  to re-rig his trimaran, his supporters said.  </P></p>

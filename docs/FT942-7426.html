The overall index finished 7 weaker at 5,518, industrials also lost 7 at 6,633 but golds edged 5 higher to 1,995. Remgro remained under pressure amid fears of smoking curbs, cigarette price increases and raised alcohol prices under the new government. It lost R1 to R27.75. Barlows lost some of Monday's gains, which followed half-year figures, losing 25 cents to R37.75 while Sappi added 50 cents to R46.50.</p>

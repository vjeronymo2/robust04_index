Yeltsin Has Gone to Sochi </F> Not for Treatment But To Rest and Work"]    [Text] The end of March promises to bring yet another  burst of activity to Russia's political life. It is planned  that a memorandum on accord and peace will have been prepared by  that time. No easy task. This fact is probably linked to some  extent with President B. Yeltsin's departure for Sochi. If the  chronology of all the memorable events of the last few years is  traced, a pattern inevitably emerges: Before making important,  not to mention unexpected, decisions the president has  disappeared for some time from journalists' field of vision and  has withdrawn in order to get away from current affairs and work  out his plans.    This supposition was indirectly confirmed by the president  himself during a conversation with journalists at Vnukovo-2  Airport. "For me, leave is a change of work regime," he said.  When asked about the state of his health, he replied: "Fine,  although I have suffered two bouts of influenza. I am going not  for treatment, but to rest and work."    Later, replying to an IZVESTIYA correspondent's question as  to whether the president foresees difficulties over the drafting  of the memorandum on accord and peace, he stated: "An easy  solution to this problem is not to be expected -- the spectrum  of opinions among political forces is too broad. Nonetheless  there is a chance for defining common approaches, which would  become the basis for accord. It is possible that leaders of  certain power structures, including the prime minister, will  come to Sochi to work on this document," he stressed. The  president also announced that during his leave he intends to  spend time working out a mechanism for implementing the  president's message to parliament. "This must be done in such a  way that this mechanism's work is scheduled on a month-by-month  basis."    Chernomyrdin arrived at Vnukovo-2 to see him off with a  magnificent bouquet of flowers. It turned out that they were  intended not for the president but his wife, whose birthday it  is today.</p>

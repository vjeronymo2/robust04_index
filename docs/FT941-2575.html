			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Travel: An image of rural England set in stone - From the south coast to Bath / Tracing the English stone belt, enjoy distinctive landscapes at close quarters The English stone belt - the seam of limestone that is the source of England's finest building stone - runs from Dorset on the south coast to Bath and then up through the middle of England to Lincoln and on to Humberside. It cuts a green and rural swathe between the brick-built industrial areas on the coasts. On the downs and wolds of the stone belt you will find some of England's prettiest villages. The limestones were laid by sedimentation millions of years ago, by the rivers of a long-disappeared Jurassic continent. Minerals and tiny crustacea were compacted into beds of stone, layer upon layer. As England slowly formed, they were buried and then buckled and crumpled by continental shift, emerging in places on the surface, ready to be quarried. 'If you really want to get to grips with limestone, James, you'll have to climb on it', said a friend, kindly offering to help me do so. This is a man whose idea of fun is technical climbing at 8,000m (26,000ft). I had done only two days' climbing in my life, so I set off apprehensively. We headed for the south coast, where the stone belt emerges in cliffs between Swanage and Portland, in places 150m high. Cormorant, the climbers' name for the outcrop we climbed, looked like a sheer face of limestone to me. It dropped to a graveyard of massive broken slabs, played over by the waves. We abseiled off - a point of no return, I realised soon enough - and set about climbing. On the way back up, Cormorant seemed an appropriate name, even if the birds have been frightened off by men in fluorescent lycra. In quieter moments, standing on a tiny ledge 100m up, I looked around. The limestone strata were clearly visible in the cliff-face. There was no quarrying here, but further down the coast I could see gaps like missing teeth where the quarrymen had used a natural ledge to tunnel into the cliff. From there the blocks were loaded straight on to boats for shipment. Certainly I had an appreciation of limestone by the end of the day. I had been hugging it, alternately wedged into crevices and clinging, spreadeagled, on to exposed buttresses, wondering what on earth I was supposed to do next. There was a certain intimacy in carefully picking tiny hand-holds out of folds in the rock. Afterwards, we took time out at the Square and Compass, a garden pub at Worth Matravers where many a climber has sat with a pint of ale and verbally picked his way back over the cliff-face. Like so many buildings in the area, the pub (which takes its name from stone-masons' tools), is built of local stone. It was mid-summer, and the sun was gradually sinking, following its longest path over the downs. Mid-June is a fine time of year and a pub garden a fine place to witness it. With the first, absurdly green blooms of spring growth just past, the trees were filling out and the hedgerows beginning to billow. Purbeck marble is another distinctive stone that originates in this area. It is a grey stone which overlies the limestone beds in thin seams and is visible in places, protruding from the cliff-face. Purbeck marble is not a marble at all, but is so called because it is one of the only British stones to take a polish. It was very popular in ecclesiastical buildings in the 13th century, and was shipped all over the country alongside Portland and Purbeck limestones, to be used for interior decoration. In Salisbury cathedral you will see slender columns of Purbeck marble decorating the massive columns of the nave. Tiny kidney-shaped crustacea - ooliths - are still visible in the stone. Salisbury Cathedral, which is visible from the downs for miles around, is built entirely of local Chilmark limestone - not far from the south coast the stone belt disappears under the chalk downs of Hardy country, re-emerging in the Vale of Wardour in northern Dorset and southern Wiltshire. In the 60 years from 1220, 60,000 tons of stone were carted from quarries 12 miles from Salisbury. Sadly, limestone steadily dissolves in water, and this has left the cathedral sorely in need of repair, although the spire has been restored. The Chilmark quarry was reopened to provide exactly the right stone for the work. The country around Chilmark and Tisbury, and on down to Sherborne, is rolling, rounded hills. The villages hide in the small, tree-lined valleys, and most of the houses are built of local stone from any of the many quarries in the area. Here the roofs are thatched or laid with slate. Tisbury has one of the country's largest tithe barns, with an enormous thatched roof. In the tiny lanes, the hedgerows were filled with wild roses and elderflower. I was out walking when I came on some familiar-looking women chattering and rootling around in the hedgerow. It was my mother and godmother, gathering the year's crop of elderflower heads. Using elderflower heads, water, sugar and some citric acid, you end up with a fine, and very English, summer drink. Limestone has many colours (resulting from the amount of iron oxide) and the different quarries are known for their colour. Where Portland stone is very white, the Cotswold stones are famed for their honey colour. Others have tinges of ochre and even pink. Chilmark stone is light beige, with some touches of green, best visible after rain. Add to this the yellow, white and red lichens and the stone has an amazing variety. The stone belt disappears below ground soon after Chilmark and appears again in north Wiltshire, on the slopes of the Avon valley. Here, villages such as Westwood and Freshford lie in wooded hollows, linked by tiny sunken lanes where the greenery threatens to bar your way. The stone is light yellow and golden and the antique, moss-covered roofing slates reappear. I arrived in the local market town, Bradford-on-Avon, where pretty stone buildings cluster on the hillsides in lines. Bradford is a friendly town, its heart still at the medieval bridge, where the medieval stone buildings of the Shambles, the old market, look on today's trade of bakeries and bookshops. Even the factory buildings are made of stone in Bradford. There was a big trade in wool (sheep have traditionally been farmed in limestone areas) and the factories stand in the centre of town on the river; the water from the weirs was used for washing and for felting into cloth. From Bradford I made my way along the Avon valley to Bath, cycling along the towpath of the Kennet and Avon canal. Woollen cloth and Bath stone were shipped along the canal early last century, but nowadays the barges carry families on summer holidays. In two places the canal is diverted across the river Avon on stone aqueducts. Bath is known for its crescents, all built of local stone. Arranged in uniform lines, they seem grand after the rural abandon of the nearby villages, but they show off light honey-coloured Bath stone ('so soft and creamy', according to one mason I met) strikingly when it shines in the summer sun. At school I was told that a man's nature is defined by the landscape around him. I suppose I know a few Scotsmen with the demeanour of granite, but it would be stretching the point to suggest that the soft contours of the stone belt - or even the dependability of limestone - have done much to shape Wiltshire's modern-day inhabitants. Still, travelling along the stone belt gives you a glimpse of people living a very English existence, rural and tranquil.</p>

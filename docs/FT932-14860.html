			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Personal View: Japan must now say 'no' When Shintaro Ishihara, the maverick Japanese politician and noted literary figure, wrote in anguish an essay asking the Japanese to learn to say 'no' to America's unceasing trade demands, it touched off a storm in the US. Many in the US display symptoms of a 'diminished giant' syndrome in the face of Japan's rise as an economic superpower, just as the British did when Germany and the US emerged as rivals at the end of the 19th century. These symptoms are so severe that rational discourse about Japan has become nearly impossible. The time has come for Japan to draw its line in the sand in response to the Clinton administration's plans to muscle its way to a new, tough-minded trade policy on Japan. This would set quantitative import shares (similar to those for semiconductors) as targets for Japanese industries and so seek 'results' in place of rules. Japan needs to say 'no' to such demands, which rest on fallacious economics and are destructive of the rules-based world trading system that America's presidents have nurtured since the second world war. But this negative response needs to be combined with positive actions to establish Japanese leadership of the multilateral trading system. The present US drive to expand 'managed' or 'results-oriented' trade with Japan, by setting quantitative import targets, derives from the conjunction of a false premise with an unpleasant fact. The false premise is that Japan's persistent trade surplus is proof that its markets are closed: if manufactured goods could be sold to Japan, it is argued, the surplus would not exist. The unpleasant fact is that the Japanese market for manufactured goods is open. It is even more open than those of the US and the European Community, both of which have made copious use of voluntary export restrictions (VERs) and anti-dumping and countervailing duties, the favoured instruments of protectionists today. Japan has largely abstained from using such measures. This combination of the false premise with the unpleasant fact implies that Japan's imports must be restrained 'somehow'. The Bush administration, in principle sensible in trade matters, decided that the problem lay in Japan's unique cultural and institutional characteristics. The Clinton administration, generally intemperate about trade questions, has decided that Japan is incorrigible. Its preferred solution is to impose import targets. Yet the underlying premise is wrong. It is wrong even though President Bill Clinton embraced it in his untutored remarks about Japan at his first press conference. Students of economics should hardly need reminding that trade barriers, as distinct from macroeconomic policies, do not determine trade balances. But this is not an argument that can be easily sold to politicians. Where abstract arguments fail, examples might work instead. A graph of Japanese trade deficits and surpluses since the second world war would show an oscillation, as is true of most countries, even though its trade policies have become steadily more liberal. Americans should also recall that the US itself ran a trade surplus for many years after the second world war, even though the US was not particularly protectionist at the time. Japan is being unjustifiably blamed. But its acceptance of import targets in response to a charge that is flawed in conception would be a still greater folly. As the semiconductor case has shown, such targets would be inherently arbitrary. There would also be no effective way for Japan to ensure that its private industries would fulfil them. The targets would also be seen as 'export protectionism', allowing any industry with political clout to secure guaranteed shares of foreign markets. If the US were to obtain Japanese agreement to such targets, the EC would not be far behind. Soon, Japan's trade would be governed by politics, not by competition and rules. Success with an economically powerful country such as Japan would whet the appetite for use of the same policy vis-a-vis other, less powerful countries. The practice would spread as businesses, seeking guaranteed market shares abroad, pressured a complacent administration towards ever more managed trade. Japan needs to be firmly 'rejectionist' when the Clinton administration makes a push for managed trade. It should learn from its semiconductor experience and heed the adage that if one gives way once, one will be asked to yield again. But Japan should also be positive. It should propose an international process to assess complaints of 'nullification and impairment' of trade obligations. Such a procedure should serve as a substitute for the establishment of import targets in industries where the US possesses only prima facie complaints, which it too readily treats as final proof. The suggested process could be bilateral, as in the US-Canada Free Trade Agreement, or, better still, multilateral, as in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The process would, in turn, be available symmetrically to Japan as a complainant, a feature that is absent from the US Congress's favourite weapon: the 301 and Super 301 legislation of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988. The chance of such a role reversal would itself moderate the Clinton administration's enthusiasm for what would otherwise be one-way demands on Japan. The Gatt is the right institution because it is based on symmetrical rights and obligations among its contracting parties. The Gatt has to be Japan's, and indeed the world's, ultimate defence against managed trade imposed by - and for the interests of - strong nations. Japan's prime minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, has not, contrary to some assertions, held up the conclusion of the Uruguay Round. It was the EC's unwillingness to make agricultural concessions acceptable to the Cairns Group of agricultural exporting countries that was the main early stumbling block. At the same time, Japan has not given an energetic push towards concluding the Round either. Mr Miyazawa should use today's summit to proclaim that he is willing to compromise on opening rice markets. Mr Miyazawa should also announce that his strategy would be to close the Round within the year and immediately have a new Round to pursue unfinished business, such as the interaction between liberal trade and environmental protection. On this issue Japan is already at the centre of the stage with its success at the Rio Earth summit. Japan should say 'no' to the unreasonable and unwise demands for managed trade. But it needs also to say 'full speed ahead' to finishing the Round, to starting a new one and to strengthening the multilateral trading system, now in severe jeopardy.

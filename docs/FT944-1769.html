			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Coca-Cola market share falls below 50% Coca-Cola's share of the Pounds 670m UK cola market has fallen below 50 per cent for the first time, say figures from Taylor Nelson AGB, the market research group. The figures - derived from AGB's panel of 8,500 consumers whose grocery purchases are monitored electronically - show that Coca-Cola's market share fell from 54.6 per cent in October to 42.2 per cent in the last week of November. That was shortly after the arrival of new colas from Mr Richard Branson's Virgin group and supermarket chain Safeway, and six months after Classic Cola was launched by J. Sainsbury, the UK's biggest food retailer. AGB's figures highlight the threat posed to Coca-Cola, which has dominated the market since its UK launch in 1921, by this year's new products - all of which are manufactured by Cott, the Canadian soft drinks group. Coca-Cola has begun a Pounds 4m advertising campaign which is a clear attack on own-label and copycat brands. With the slogan 'All colas are not the same', it shows a family attempting to buy Coca-Cola in a ghostly supermarket manned by robot-like assistants selling own-label products only. Mr Stephan Buck, a director of AGB, said: 'Coke's share has been coming down to under 50 per cent on a long-term trend over the last year or so. But there may be some initial trying of other new brands and they may not stand the test of time. The key thing is whether people make repeat purchases.' AGB's figures show Virgin Cola achieved a share of 8.7 per cent at the end of November, with Safeway's Select Cola one of several brands which together held 14.8 per cent of the market. Sainsbury's Classic had 12.2 per cent, while Pepsi-Cola retained the second-biggest share with 20.1 per cent. Coca-Cola said its UK sales increased 21 per cent in the third quarter of this year, in spite of the competition. Mr George Bradt, its new marketing director, said UK per-capita consumption of cola was lower than in other countries and there was considerable scope to expand the market.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Short segments of the proposed facility's steam supply pipeline to P.H. Glatfelter Company and condensate return pipeline would also be located within an identified 100-year floodplain, affecting approximately 0.3 acres. A small area (approximately 0.8 acres) of the Codorus Creek 100-year floodplain would be impacted by ladder tracks and rail spur that would require an expansion of the existing YorkRail right-of-way on P.H. Glatfelter Company property. The rail structures would be similar to, and closely parallel, the existing YorkRail Main line at the same elevation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Impacts during construction would include equipment and vehicle access, earth disturbance, sedimentation, erosion from exposed soils, damaged vegetation, and placement and compaction of fill to support new rail lines. In addition, the steam and condensate return pipelines to P.H. Glatfelter Company would require permanent pipe supports to be placed within the floodplain. During operation, there would be some periodic minor disturbance due to personnel and equipment entry for inspection and maintenance of the new ladder tracks, rail spur, and above-ground steam and condensate return pipelines to P.H. Glatfelter Company.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The potential impacts and mitigation measures associated with the above proposed activities within identified floodplains are discussed in Section 4 of the Draft Statement and constitutes the floodplains assessment in accordance with 10 CFR Part 1022.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments regarding the effects of the proposed action on floodplains may be submitted to the Department in accordance with the procedures described below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with Executive Order 11990, Protection of Wetlands, and the Department's Procedures for Compliance with Floodplains/Wetlands Environmental Review Requirements (10 CFR Part 1022), wetlands protection has also been considered in the Department's Draft Statement. Above- and below-ground pipeline connections between the proposed new facility and existing facilities would require construction affecting approximately 0.5 acres of wetlands. These wetlands would be temporarily disturbed as a result of construction and excavation activities associated with pipeline installation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Four identified wetlands, along with Codorus Creek, would be potentially affected by the proposed project and utility corridors. A fringe wetland bordering Mill Pond and Kessler Pond would be unavoidably affected by placement of permanent pipe support foundations for a pipe rack supporting the steam and condensate return pipelines to the P.H. Glatfelter Company facility. This wetland impact is unavoidable due to the proposed facility being sited on the opposite side of Codurus Creek from the P.H. Glatfelter Company facility. Three other wetlands would be traversed by supply and return pipelines for the proposed project cooling tower. A total of approximately 0.20 acre of these three wetlands would be impacted for excavation and underground placement of cooling tower supply and return pipelines from the proposed facility to P.H. Glatfelter Company facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During construction of the pipeline interconnect, vegetation would be selectively removed using manual labor whenever possible in order to minimize potential impacts associated with mechanical clearing techniques. York County Energy Partners would obtain regulatory approval prior to construction or disturbance of wetlands. Potential impacts during construction and operation, such as erosion and sedimentation, would be controlled with appropriate mitigation measures (such as silt fencing during construction).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It should be noted, however, that construction of the proposed electrical interconnect corridor, the proposed rail spur, and ladder track associated with this proposed project would not result in incursion into wetland areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Potential environmental impacts to wetlands are discussed more fully in Chapter 4 of the Draft Statement and constitutes the wetlands assessment in accordance with 10 CFR Part 1022. Comments regarding the effects of the proposed action on wetland areas may be submitted to the Department in accordance with the procedures described below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Comment Procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Availability of Draft Statement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Copies of the Draft Statement are being distributed to organizations, environmental groups, and individuals known to be interested in or affected by the proposed project.

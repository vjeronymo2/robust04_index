			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani </F> with reporters following the ceremony launching the National  Civilian Police in Soyapango on 3 Jan--recorded]    [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] [LA PRENSA GRAFICA reporter  Gerardo Lopez] Good morning, Mr. President. I have two  questions. Last week an ARENA [Nationalist Republican Alliance]  deputy said that there was proof of the transshipment of arms  from the FMLN [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front] to  Guatemala; the second question is what is your opinion regarding  the incidents that are taking place in Mexico?    [Cristiani] I believe that as far as specific proof is  concerned, the reports from Guatemalan authorities claim that  there is a shipment of arms to Guatemala. There is no specific  proof, however, of who is shipping the weapons. We want to be  very clear about this, because we are not going to accuse anyone  until we are entirely certain. We are continuing to coordinate  with Guatemalan authorities in this respect. We are conducting  an investigation, and as soon as we have any information you  will hear about it.    One thing is clear, however, certain weapons were not  available in Guatemala, and today they are being recovered by  the Guatemalan Army; this shows that there is a flow of weapons  into Guatemala, and there are only two neighboring countries  through which they could be passing--Honduras and El  Salvador--although they might be coming from Nicaragua and pass  through El Salvador. Why is there is no specific proof yet?    Concerning Mexico, we deplore the fact that there are still  groups on our continent that are trying to use violence and  terror to achieve political aims. We believe that this must pass  into history so that novelists can write about it, but it cannot  be justified in view of the advances of the processes in Latin  America. We cannot justify the existence of armed rebel groups  causing violence and terror, particularly against the people,  who are the ones who always suffer the most in activities of  this type.    We believe that if countries such as El Salvador have been  able to give an example of solutions to these problems, it is  shocking to hear that there are groups that now want to launch  such an adventure. Experiences in other places show us that the  idea is to do away with, not encourage, activities of this type;  consequently, we can only feel disappointed to see that on the  American Continent there are still minority groups bent on using  violent methods.    [Reporter Mario Godoy Landin] Good morning, Mr. President.  My first question has to do with the transshipment of arms.  How is the verification of the serial numbers of the AK-47  rifles that were found in Guatemala progressing? Have they  already been verified? The second question is, regarding the  violence and murder of several peasant families in different  areas of the country could one consider that the deployment of  Armed Forces members has not achieved anything?    [Cristiani] Regarding your first question, I do not have the  information on hand. We will try to check to see if there is  specific information regarding the serial numbers, and we will  release the information as soon as something is obtained.    Regarding your second question, I do not believe that the  fact that criminal actions are perpetrated means that something  has or has not failed. In this case I would like to ask if we  would not have had a larger number of incidents without the  preventive deployment in the area? This is something that is  very hard to measure. What is obvious is that there is much  violent activity and that many problems, even family problems,  are being resolved violently. Maybe this is due to what our  country has gone through. A large number of Salvadorans have  been exposed to a tradition of violence and believe that  problems can only be solved through violence. I do not believe,  however, that one can come to the conclusion at which you  arrived: that one thing is directly linked to the other. The  question should be, had the deployment not been carried out  would there have been more or less violent incidents? [passage  omitted]</p>

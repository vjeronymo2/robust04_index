			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / Survey of Malaysia (9): A consensus born of progress - The political arena is quiet, but not as somnolent as it appears Malaysia prides itself on its political stability. the national front, composed of parties representing the country's various racial groups but dominated by the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), has governed since independence from British rule in 1957. Dr Mahathir Mohamad, prime minister and UMNO president, has been in power since 1981. Dr Mahathir influences virtually every aspect of Malaysian life. Not only is the 67 year-old prime minister seen as the main architect of the country's soaring economic growth. The government's hold over the media ensures that Dr Mahathir's views on a range of issues - from moral decay and economic decline in the west to religious correctness at home - are constantly emphasised. Economic success has brought about a large degree of political complacency. Constitutional amendments which again strengthened the powers of the executive at the expense of the judiciary were rushed through parliament earlier this year with scarcely a whimper of public dissent. The political opposition is weak and divided. General elections are likely to be held either later this year or early next. UMNO seems certain to maintain its firm grip. Lift up the political carpet and things are not quite so orderly. The main points of conflict are found not between the country's various political parties but within UMNO itself. Since the party of the majority Malays controls virtually all positions of power, any internal upheaval is likely to have profound consequences for the country's future. In UMNO elections late last year Mr Anwar Ibrahim, the 47 year-old finance minister, was declared party deputy president. Subsequently Mr Anwar was appointed deputy prime minister - and the most likely heirto the Mahathir mantle. Three of Mr Anwar's supporters, all in their 40s, were promoted to leading UMNO positions in the party elections. The old guard, represented by Mr Ghafar Baba, Mr Anwar's rival for the UMNO post, was unceremoniously pushed aside. Suave and urbane, his conversation peppered with literary and scholastic references, Mr Anwar is said to represent the Malay baru, or new Malay - modern in outlook, a man capable of carrying through the ambitious Mahathir vision of making Malaysia a fully industrialised nation by the year 2020. At times the Mahathir/Anwar duo seems to be a carefully balanced alliance. At other times their opinions seem to conflict. Dr Mahathir emphasises economic goals, constantly urging Malaysians to work toward achieving higher growth figures. Mr Anwar warns that people must not be obsessed with material growth and must set more time aside for intellectual pursuits. Dr Mahathir rails against the west and boasts of the region's achievements. Mr Anwar cautions Asians not to be arrogant or to be blind to problems in their own societies. Mr Anwar firmly denies that there are any political problems between himself and the prime minister. Yet analysts feel that tensions are inevitable between the ambitious younger politician and an elder leader who seems to have no wish to retire. Allied to this are the increasingly visible strains that have developed between Mr Anwar and Mr Daim Zainuddin, a close confidant of Dr Mahathir and a considerable power behind the scenes. Mr Daim is a former finance minister and functions as a special economic adviser to the government as well as UMNO treasurer. As Dr Mahathir's trusted lieutenant in the 1980s, Mr Daim helped rebuild UMNO finances after a damaging party split. Mr Daim is a corporate wheeler dealer who has backed the rise of several Malay businessmen. Political analysts say Mr Anwar has become angry with Mr Daim's attempts to influence government and so promote the interests of his business associates. Yet as long as Mr Daim has the ear of Dr Mahathir, Mr Anwar can take little action. While UMNO's top echelon worries about personalities, the rank and file has been voicing growing concern about corruption within the party and a nationwide cult of vote buying and so called 'money politics'. The party fears the alienation of a wide section of the public from the political process. In June, UMNO held a special convention to discuss such matters. 'If we accept money politics in the party, if corruption becomes a culture in UMNO, if our leaders gain positions through bribery, we will have a government that is filled with and led by corrupt criminals,' Dr Mahathir told delegates. The convention agreed that in future any member involved in money politics would face expulsion from the party. Stamping out such abuses will be hard. Opposition politicians accuse UMNO itself of making the most flagrant use of money in the election process. Earlier this year Dr Mahathir's national front finally gained control of the local administration in the east Malaysia state of Sabah. Sabah's former rulers not only accused Dr Mahathir's administration of witholding much needed development funds in an attempt to coerce people into voting for the government party. They said the national front was buying votes to the extent that it was 'dropping money out of helicopters'. Other forms of money politics are deeply ingrained, mainly due to historical factors. Traditionally Malaysia's Chinese community, which makes up about 35 per cent of the population, has controlled much of the country's economy. In the early 1970s the government launched its New Economic Policy (NEP), designed to give 'bumiputra', or indigenous Malays, a greater share in the country's wealth. Malays were favoured in government jobs, in education and in business. Under a wide ranging privatisation programme which got underway in the late 1980s Malays were granted preferential and highly profitable share allocations. UMNO itself became directly involved in the private sector, controlling a complex web of businesses stretching into most areas of the economy. A new corporate elite emerged, buttressed by close ties to leading politicians. Mr Daim insists that since a reorganisation of UMNO finances in 1988, the party has not had any business interests. Mr Terence Gomez, a Malaysian academic who has made an extensive study of UMNO's corporate investments, says that while UMNO may no longer have direct control of companies, the connections are still there. 'A stage has been reached when a business elite, made up of bumiputras and their Chinese partners and with close connections to leading politicians, is able to dominate a large segment of corporate life. It can also seriously influence stock market activity.' The close ties between the business world and leading politicians make it difficult to put a stop to money politics. Such ties also cause resentment among UMNO members who feel the party has lost its way. They feel decisions are made by an urban based, wealthy group with little commitment to the lot of the Malay community. Dr Mahathir's position is secure. But with his party undergoing a crisis of identity, there could be plenty of political fireworks ahead.</p>

			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Lloyd's chief might have quit if governance had changed LLOYD'S OF LONDON chief executive Mr Alan Lord said yesterday that he might have had to quit last week if a proposal to change the way the insurance market is governed had been accepted. Although the Council, Lloyd's governing body, agreed the bulk of a series of reforms put forward by a 14-strong task force, it rejected the proposed separation of its regulatory and business development functions. The change is regarded by the chairman of the task force, Mr David Rowland, as being among the most important of 65 suggestions. Last week the Association of Lloyd's Members, which represents more than 9,000 Lloyds Names, also criticised the decision to reject it. Mr Lord said acceptance would have delayed implementation of other reforms suggested by the task force. These include a modification of the principle of unlimited liability for Names, the individuals whose capital supports underwriting at Lloyd's. But yesterday, hinting that Lloyd's had understated its case last week, Mr Lord said: 'If we'd gone along this route I wouldn't have felt able to go along with it. Its the mystery of the month why they came out with it.' Mr David Coleridge, chairman of Lloyd's, added fuel to the fire by describing some of the task force's thinking on governance as 'codswallop'. The task force advocated the creation of a market board, made up mainly of representatives of underwriting businesses, which should have responsibility for developing the market's business strategy. The Council - on which outside Names and nominees already have a majority - would retain its regulatory responsibilities, although it would be strengthened by the appointment of an independent chairman. Mr Lord said the creation of the market board would be 'retrogressive' because it would have reduced the effectiveness of the regulatory structure introduced by the Lloyd's Act of 1982. At the Council meeting the proposals had been rejected because 'in structural terms they made no sense at all.' Mr Lord said: 'To divide the thing into two with a market board which instituted market changes and a regulatory body snapping round its heels trying to regulate what has already been done doesn't work.' He also said Lloyd's would have been deprived of a 'sovereign body'. 'You can't run an outfit with two heads,' he added. Outhwaite backed, Page 8</p>

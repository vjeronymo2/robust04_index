			<p><P> October 9, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> ROZELLE GETS OWN MVP AWARD  </P> <P> Pete Rozelle, the man who led the NFL for 30 years, will have his name on the  trophy awarded each year to the most valuable player in the Super Bowl.  </P> <P> "No name is more synonymous with the Super Bowl than Pete Rozelle," said Paul  Tagliabue, who replaced Rozelle as commissioner last season. "It was his  imagination and foresight that made this great event a reality, and his  guidance that elevated the Super Bowl to an unofficial national holiday on  Super Sunday."  </P> <P> Since leaving office on Nov. 5, 1989, Rozelle has been a consultant to the  league. The first trophy bearing his name will be presented on Jan. 27 at  Tampa, Fla.  </P></p>

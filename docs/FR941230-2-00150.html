			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In fiscal year 1994, the Johns Hopkins University was awarded funds to test its intensive community-based aftercare model in four demonstration sites. Each of the four sites will receive up to $100,000 to support program implementation in fiscal year 1995. An independent evaluation contractor is providing an initial evaluation design and documenting the implementation process under a separate grant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Johns Hopkins University will receive a supplemental award of $220,000 to provide training and technical assistance to the four selected sites and to OJJDP's Youth Environmental Service Program, Boot Camp Pilot Program, and Safe Futures Program. This is the second budget period of a three-year project. BJA will contribute $600,000 to the support of this program in fiscal year 1995.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Juvenile Justice Statistics and Systems Development_$550,000  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of the Juvenile Justice Statistics and Systems Development (SSD) Program is to improve Federal, State, and local juvenile justice statistics on juveniles as victims and offenders. The SSD Program helps OJJDP to formulate a comprehensive program for the collection, analysis and dissemination of national statistics on juveniles as victims and offenders, and to document the juvenile justice system's response. A major product to be completed will be a national report on juvenile offending and victimization. Work on this product will consist mainly of report production followup, including the completion of a detailed technical appendix and preparation of additional products for dissemination. The SSD program will focus on the following areas in fiscal year 1995: juveniles in the criminal justice system; development and testing of a training curriculum for improving information systems; integration of juvenile justice, mental health, and child welfare data collection; and improving information on juvenile detention.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The program will be implemented by the current grantee, the National Center for Juvenile Justice. No additional applications will be solicited in fiscal year 1995.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Development of OJJDP's Comprehensive Strategy for Serious, Violent, and Chronic Juvenile Offenders_$500,000  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The National Council on Crime and Delinquency (NCCD), in collaboration with Developmental Research and Programs, Inc. (DRP), has completed Phase I of a collaborative effort to support development and implementation of OJJDP's  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comprehensive Strategy for Serious, Violent, and Chronic Juvenile Offenders.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This effort involved assessing existing and previously researched programs to identify effective and promising programs identified in the Comprehensive Strategy. A series of reports has been completed on early intervention for ages 0 to 6, prevention from childhood to adolescence, graduated sanctions, risk and needs assessments, and an operations manual. Phase II, to be carried out in fiscal year 1995, will include: information dissemination; program development and implementation activities; providing information to national, State and local organizations; providing training and technical assistance to Title V Prevention and Serious, Violent, and Chronic Juvenile Offenders, and Safe Futures Program sites; and conducting a series of regional seminars for representative groups of key leaders.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The program will be implemented by NCCD ($275,000) and DRP ($225,000) under cooperative agreements. No additional applications will be solicited in fiscal year 1995.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Training for Juvenile Corrections and Detention Staff_$500,000  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OJJDP proposes to continue the development and implementation of a comprehensive training program for juvenile corrections and detention management staff through its interagency agreement with the National Institute of Corrections (NIC). The program is designed to offer a core curriculum for juvenile corrections and detention administrators and mid-level management personnel in such areas as leadership development, management, training of trainers, legal issues, cultural diversity, the role of the victim in juvenile corrections, gang activity, juvenile programming for specialized needs of offenders, and overcrowding. The training would be conducted at the NIC Academy and regionally. This program is a continuation activity and would be implemented in fiscal year 1995 under an interagency agreement with NIC. No additional applications would be solicited in fiscal year 1995.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

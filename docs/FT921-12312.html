			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / Technology: Added-value fax service under starter's orders Yamato Transport, Japan's largest door-to-door parcel delivery company, is trying to get the most out of its central distribution system by selling services that operate on the company's distribution mainframe computer. It has installed a facsimile messaging and information system at retail outlets. The service was set up just over a year ago and the company has already installed 5,000 Panasonic fax machines in stores. Yamato's system is one example of the fax services available to Japanese users as a result of the growing liberalisation of telecommunications. The Yamato messaging system enables users to send and receive fax messages at any of the stores where a machine is installed. Yamato says a typical customer would be an executive away from the office who needs to get hold of a document quickly, or to send one. The service also provides information from a menu including horse racing results, baseball scores and tourist information - in English or Japanese. A shopping information sheet, for example, would include details of how to get to a particular area, a list of shop phone numbers and a map of the district, including the main stores and subway lines. The service also operates a central system for companies which need to fax the same document to several people. Information such as a company's list of customers, suppliers and their fax numbers is stored on Yamato's computer. The user can key in a request, from their own fax machine, for a document to be sent to all of its suppliers, for example. This will be done automatically. Customers have to register with Yamato as fax users. Personal codes are keyed in to the fax machine and users are billed later. At the moment, the service contributes only a tiny proportion of revenues - less than 1 per cent  - and the company says it will take three years before it moves into profit. Yamato is planning for 50,000-60,000 users a day by 1995. The company has released no figures on the current number of users, although it says 10,000 customers would be a good day. Setting up the service cost Y3bn (Pounds 13.5m) including installation of the first 5,000 machines. Running costs include the use of NTT phone lines. The fax machines are leased by Yamato and most of the information used by the service is provided free in return for advertising on the fax sheets. Stores where fax machines are installed receive a commission fee. Competition is so far limited to only a few small operators. 'It would be a problem if NTT got into it,' says Katsuhiko Saiki of Yamato.</p>

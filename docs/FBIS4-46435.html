			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara--A series of mystery murders in the past week  have prompted allegations that some State forces in Turkey are  linked to a systematic campaign to intimidate pro-Kurdish  businessmen and politicians. On Saturday a group of fishermen  discovered the bodies of pro-Kurdish businessman Savas Buldan  and two of his colleagues, Haci Koray and Adnan Yildirim near  the Melen river in the Yigilca township of Bolu province. The  three had been shot in the back of the head. Police sources  said the three had also been tortured and were without  identification papers when found. Relatives identified the  bodies which were brought to Istanbul on Sunday.    Buldan was a wealthy Istanbul businessman who is in the  hotel  and restaurant business. He comes from the township of  Yuksekova in the southeastern province of Hakkari. His  colleagues Koray was also from Yuksekova while Yildirim came  from the township of Lice in Diyarbakir province. Buldan's  brother Necdet Buldan is the former mayor of Yuksekova and  belongs to the pro-Kurdish Democracy Party (DEP). The killings  follow the killing of Muhsin Melik and his driver in the  southeastern provincial center of Urfa by four or five  unidentified persons. Melik is the founder of the People's  Democrat Party (HADEP), a new pro-Kurdish party set up to  eventually replace DEP. Melik was the former provincial chairman  of DEP.    Before his death Melik reportedly told his brother that he  had been shot by plainclothes policemen just outside his office.  Melik allegedly shot and wounded one of his assailants. The  governor of Urfa said two persons were in custody related to the  murder.    Buldan and his two companions were allegedly taken into  custody by a group of policemen outside Istanbul's Cinar Hotel.  The persons who apprehended them reportedly showed their police  identification cards and then took them away in unmarked cars,  according to the personnel of the Cinar Hotel who witnessed the  incident.    The death of Buldan was the latest in a chain of murders  committed against persons who allegedly have links with Kurdish  separatist militants. The first case concerned pro-Kurdish  underground figure Behcet Canturk and his driver Recep Kuzucu  who were found murdered near the Sapanca section of the  Istanbul-Ankara highway. Canturk was also from the Lice  township.    Later the body of Canturk's lawyer Yusuf Ziya Ekinci was  found near Ankara's Golbasi district in February. He had been  killed by seven bullets.    In March another prominent figure from Lice, contractor  Fevzi  Arslan, and his brother Sahin were kidnapped at gun point in  their Aksaray office in Istanbul and their bodies were later  found on the Istanbul-Ankara highway.    Buldan was previously taken into custody in 1992 when police  raided his house in Istanbul and discovered he was hosting DEP  Diyarbakir Deputy Leyla Zana, her husband Megdi Zana and seven  other people who were allegedly linked to the outlawed Kurdistan  Workers' Party (PKK). There were claims that Buldan had  provided PKK with guns and financial aid. He was later  released. Conservative Turkish papers claimed Buldan may have  been killed by the mafia because of drug trafficking.    Pro-Kurdish daily Ozgur Ulke, however, pointed the finger at  Prime Minister Tansu Ciller and said the prime minister had  warned on November 4, 1993 that the government has information  about businessmen and other personalities who give extortion  money to the PKK and had threatened to "make them pay." The  paper claimed Ciller was now making the businessmen "pay."  Ozgur Ulke quoted former National Intelligence Organization  (MIT) member Professor Mahir Kaynak as saying "the murders were  planned by those who had provided the list of pro-Kurdish  businessmen to the prime minister." Kaynak also said the  murders were being planned and carried out by those in the State  cadres who do not want a political solution to the Kurdish  problem. The Turkish Daily News learnt that at first police had  confirmed Bulan and his friends had been taken into custody but  later denied this. The Bulan family members reportedly had some  sources inside the police and they alleged that they were told  "do not follow up your complaints."    Buldan's brother contacted Deputy Prime Minister Murat  Karayalcin who allegedly told him "this matter is way above my  head." Meanwhile, in Ankara DEP officials charged also that  Muhsin Melik was killed by police in Urfa. DEP Acting Chairman  Remzi Kartal said the police were at the scene of the incident  only two minutes after Melik was shot. Melik was then wounded  and refused to get into the police car saying "you are the  people who shot me."    Kartal said eye witnesses identified the license plate of  the  car used in the murder of Melik as 06 ED 246. It was a white  Renault Broadway. He claimed a similar car was seen being  driven into the Urfa police headquarters the same day carrying a  wounded person. Kartal claimed "those who oppose state policies  are either silenced or eliminated."</p>

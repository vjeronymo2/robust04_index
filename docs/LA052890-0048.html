			<p><P> May 28, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLF ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> WITHOUT A CENT, STEPHENSON SINKS $200,000 PUTT  </P> <P> Jan Stephenson, within two holes of being shut out of the $450,000 purse, made  a $200,000 putt for par on the 17th hole Sunday in the LPGA's inaugural Skins  Game at Frisco, Tex.  </P> <P> JoAnne Carner won $75,000 with a 25-foot birdie putt on the 11th hole. Under a  format calling for prize money on each hole to be carried forward until there  is a clear winner, the purse built by $25,000 on the 12th, and by $35,000 jumps  over the next four.  </P> <P> That sent Carner, Stephenson, Nancy Lopez and Betsy King to the tee on the  140-yard, par-three 17th at the Stonebriar Country Club with $200,000 at stake.  </P> <P> When Carner, Lopez and King all hit windblown six-iron shots into bunkers, the  door was opened for Stephenson, who used a five iron to put the ball 12 feet  from the pin. The other three players missed their par putts and Stephenson  left her birdie chance nearly two feet short, but sank the putt for par.  </P> <P> The 18th was halved, so they went to an extra hole, which Carner won with a  15-foot birdie putt. It was worth $35,000 and made Carner the runner-up with  $110,000.  </P> <P> Lopez won $95,000 and King made $45,000 on Saturday, but both were blanked  Sunday.  </P> <P> Dale Douglass made a six-foot putt for par on the second playoff hole to defeat  Gary Player in a $500,000 tournament at Malvern, Pa., for his sixth Senior Tour  victory.  </P> <P> Douglass and Player finished at four-under-par 206 after 54 holes after being  even since the 11th home of the final round. Player shot a one-under-par 69,  while Douglass came in with a 70.  </P> <P> After halving the first playoff hole, the 15th, Player drove into the trees,  failed to reach the green on his approach and missed a difficult putt for a  double bogey.  </P> <P> Bob Charles (67) and Charles Coody (70) tied for third at 207, while George  Archer shot a 68 for 208, one stroke ahead of Lee Trevino, who had a 71.  </P> <P> Wayne Levi made a four-foot birdie putt just before darkness threatened to halt  play and won a $1-million tournament by one shot at Marietta, Ga.  </P> <P> Levi had a three-under-par 69 in the final round, which was delayed six hours  by rain. Had he missed his final putt, there would have been a four-way playoff  today.  </P> <P> Winless since 1985, Levi had a 72-hole score of 275, 13 under par, one stroke  ahead of Larry Mize (70), Keith Clearwater (72) and Nick Price (70).  </P> <P> Levi, trailing Clearwater and Mize by two shots with six holes left, gained a  share of the lead with birdies on Nos. 14 and 15.  </P> <P> Pat Bradley had five birdies and shot a two-under-par 69 to beat Patty Sheehan  by three shots in a $350,000 LPGA tournament at Corning, N.Y.  </P> <P> Bradley finished at 274, 10 under par, to gain her third victory of the season  and 26th of her career.  </P> <P> Sheehan shot a 68, while Alice Ritzman also shot a 68 to finish at 278.  </P> <P> Jose-Maria Olazabal of Spain sank a 12-foot par putt on the 18th hole for a  one-shot lead after three rounds of the European PGA Championship at Virginia  Water, England. Olazabal finished with a 69 for 203 after 54 holes, one shot  ahead of Mike Harwood of Australia, who had a 67.  </P></p>

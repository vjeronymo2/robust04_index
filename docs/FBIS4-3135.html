			<p>BFN     [Text] This year Qinghai Province's distribution of  treasury bonds has progressed smoothly. So far the province has  distributed two-year treasury bonds worth 44 million yuan or so,  completing some 60 percent of the assigned task, and three-year  treasury bonds worth 61 million yuan or so, fulfilling more than  one-third of the task. The province was assigned a quota 240  million yuan worth of treasury bonds this year.    To ensure the smooth completion of the task, leaders from  localities at all levels of the province have attached great  importance to the task and gone down to various bond  distributing units one after another to inspect the  implementation of the various distribution measures taken and  study and seek solutions to existing problems. While doing  vigorous publicity work, the financial institutions and treasury  bond intermediary organs of the financial departments, which  were assigned the task of distributing bonds this year, have  paid keen attention to offering better services in various  aspects of bond distributions. In the course of bond  distribution, all banks have done their best to set up more  distributing outlets and appropriately extend their working  hours. The Bank of China Qinghai Branch, which has well-operated  grass- roots distributing outlets, and the intermediary organs  of the financial departments at all levels dispatched personnel  to go down to grass-roots units to do propaganda and  mobilization work, organize registration of those who underwrite  in advance, and carry out the sale of treasury bonds in a  concentrated way to expand sales. As far as the business of  exchanging old treasury bonds for new ones, which was introduced  this year, all underwriting units have also taken various  measures to simplify the buying and [words indistinct]  procedures to make things convenient for people to buy the bonds.    In light of the recent distribution of treasury bonds in our  province, a person in charge of a relevant department said: All  underwriting units should do an active job of propaganda and  mobilization work and offer better services. The province's  task of distributing treasury bonds this year is expected to be  completed at an early date.</p>

			<p><P> April 7, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JIM BOOROS SHOOTS 6-UNDER-PAR 64 TO LEAD THREE PLAYERS BY ONE STROKE AT  HATTIESBURG  </P> <P> Jim Booros shot a six-under-par 64 Thursday to take a one-stroke lead in the  first round of the $200,000 PGA Deposit Guaranty golf tournament.  </P> <P> Booros, 37, finished with six birdies and a dozen pars over the 6,280-yard  Hattiesburg Country Club Course for a one-shot edge over Robert Thompson, Rocco  Mediate, and Barry Cheesman.  </P> <P> Booros, who was using a new putter, said the key to his round was the ninth  hole, where he put his tee shot into the woods but scrambled to save par.  </P> <P> The ninth hole also made the difference for Mediate.  </P> <P> "I had two good shots there that really turned me around," he said.  </P> <P> Mediate had one more birdie than Booros, but also had a pair of bogeys.  </P> <P> David Ogrin, the 1987 winner, was in a group of six at 67. Defending champion  Frank Conner shot a 73.  </P></p>

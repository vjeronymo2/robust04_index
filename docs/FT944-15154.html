			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Survey of North American Business Locations (6): Choosing the ideal site The first step in site selection is corporate planning. Consultants emphatically say that a company's strategy for a relocation must be clear from the start. In this, consultants can elicit some clarity by posing the right questions, such as 'What are the problems you think a move would solve?' The consultants then begin to explore the needs that a company must have satisfied in any relocation. These can vary. If it is a distribution centre, highways, airports, telecommunications and proximity of markets will be at the top the list. If it is a manufacturing plant, the availability of labour, wages, power costs, proximity of suppliers and operational costs will be top concerns. A variety of data bases are consulted to find a pool of locations that fit the client's needs. These are then whittled down after closer examination and a refinement of demands. For example, a good consultant will know that an American high school diploma in New York city means little in the way of basic skills, while the same diploma in Minneapolis means the graduate can read, write and do sums. With a narrowed list, the consultants then often organise field trips for the company's top executives to see the sites themselves. These often include presentations by local business and government officials. Some cities and states have sophisticated business recruitment programs and consultants should have the knowledge to know who can really deliver on their promises. Consultants can help sort out the incentives and deal sweeteners that various locations offer. And, once the choice is made, they will negotiate the deal and implement it. This can mean everything from helping relocated employees find housing to advice on job-hunting for spouses and schools.</p>

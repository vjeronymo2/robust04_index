			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / Groups accused on abuses of rights TWO THIRDS of the UK's top companies have links with countries that are abusers of human rights, according to a report published today, Scheherazade Daneshkhu writes. The Ethical Investment Research Service (Eiris) which screens companies for private investors to see whether they meet certain ethical criteria, says that 36 of the 50 largest UK companies are involved. 'Many UK company groups have subsidiary and associated companies all over the world,' Eiris says. 'By operating in a country, the company group is making a direct investment in that country's economy.' The survey covers all 590 companies in the FTA All-Share Index at the end of last year. It found that 200 had subsidiary or associated companies in one or more of the countries identified, while 31 companies had significant subsidiaries in countries with high levels of human rights abuses. They included Thorn-EMI, the electronics group, which employs 340 people in a subsidiary in Mexico, a country from which Amnesty International has received reports of torture. The report also cites Tate and Lyle which has subsidiaries or associated companies in Kenya, Somalia, South Africa, Sri Lanka and Sudan, all of which suffer human rights abuses. The top 50 companies by market value which are not identified by the oppressive-regime criteria used by Eiris are: Abbey National, Argyll Group, Associated British Foods, BAA, British Gas, Eurotunnel, Kingfisher, Land Securities, Marks and Spencer, National Power, Reuters Holdings, J. Sainsbury, Tesco and Vodafone Group. Oppressive Regimes. Eiris, Freepost, London SW8 1BR. Pounds 15.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller by Salih </F> Zvizdic; place and date not given: "Croat-Bosniak Alliance Has  no Alternative"]    [Text] Electing Tansa Ciller as prime minister of Turkey  was important for that country, not only because she is the  first female prime minister, but also because, by electing her,  power was in a way transferred to the new, younger generation of  Turkish statesmen and politicians. She took office in June  1993, according to the decision of the influential Party of the  Right Way. She succeeded Mr. Demirel, who became the president  of Turkey. When he was prime minister, he appointed her  minister of economics and accepted her slogan about "two keys"  (for the house and the car). As minister of economics, she  bravely tackled the large national debt, inflation, structural  state problems, and conquering financial markets.    The new prime minister has very quickly shown the energy of  the young generation and has become prominent as a radical  reformist in many areas. She immediately replaced 17 out of 20  members of the cabinet, and her team, which is mostly drawn from  the young generation, has reached the very top in terms of  service to the state. She has also launched numerous  initiatives, especially economic ones.  <H5>  Politician and Scholar </H5>   She was born in 1946; she majored in economics at Robert  College (today the Bosphorus University), the English University  in Istanbul. She got her master's degree and her doctorate at  New Hampshire, Connecticut, and Yale Universities. She is now  an economics fellow at Bosphorus University and associate  professor at all three universities in the United States. She  has written many books on the subject of economics, and several  research papers, articles, and essays. Her husband is an  entrepreneur in Istanbul, and they have two children.    [Zvizdic] What do you think about current political  relations between Turkey and Croatia?    [Ciller] Relations between Turkey and Croatia are developing  in all areas, and I would like to use this opportunity to pay  tribute to the late President Ozal, who visited Zagreb in 1993  and contributed much to the development of our bilateral  relations. President Tudjman's visit to Ankara last year was  also a significant contribution to our friendly relations.    Furthermore, we would like to see Croatia cooperate with the  Bosniaks. We think that there is no alternative to the  Croat-Bosniak-Muslim alliance, for that alliance is a natural  development and a historical necessity, not something imposed  from abroad or a tactical move. If Croatia wants to stop  Serbian aggression and the realization of a greater Serbia,  there really is no alternative to the Croat-Bosniak-Muslim  alliance. The progress and development of relations with Turkey  will depend on the relation of Croatia and the Bosniaks.    Turkey and Croatia have much in common; first, they are both  democratic countries, and both believe in democratic  institutions and values. Second, they are both secular  countries. Religion is a matter of personal choice and does not  govern the state, and religious tolerance is most important in a  state. And third, both countries have a free market economy  with a process of privatization of state-owned firms. And  lastly, let me point out that they are both European countries  and hope to become full members of the European Community in the  next couple of years. I am convinced that there will be joint  Turkish-Croatian-Bosniak economic investment when conditions for  peace and stability are re-established.    [Zvizdic] In Croatia, we often hear that three very capable  ambassadors -- of Turkey, Germany, and the United States -- play  an important role in mediation for better relations and  understanding between Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. Is the  involvement of these three ambassadors of a special kind?    [Ciller] You mentioned three members of NATO who are closely  cooperating within NATO and outside it. Those three countries  hold the same views on many problems, including the solution for  the problem of Bosnia-Herzegovina on several levels. I believe  Germany and the United States, just like Turkey, are convinced  that there is no alternative to cooperation and an alliance of  Croatia and the Bosniaks. I also believe that the Turkish  ambassador has friendly relations and closely cooperates with  his German and U.S. counterparts.    [Zvizdic] What was your main reason for going to Sarajevo?  Does it have something to do with the meeting of foreign  ministers of Turkey and Great Britain that was held in Ankara?    [Ciller] My brief visit to Sarajevo with [Pakistani] Prime  Minister Bhutto was a humanitarian gesture, for we did not go  there primarily as prime ministers, but mostly as concerned  mothers. We went there to share the grief, unbearable sadness,  and incredible suffering of all the people in the besieged city,  regardless of their religion and nationality.  <H5>  Air Strikes or Lifting the Arms Embargo </H5>   That tragedy in the heart of Europe in this day and age is  incomprehensible! It is sad, for the whole world is watching  helplessly and doing practically nothing to stop the drama with  the means that it has at its disposal. Prime Minister Bhutto  and myself wanted to draw the attention of the world to the  alarming humanitarian catastrophe of Sarajevo and remind them  that the right to live is the most important human right and  that it must be respected. International organizations like the  United Nations and NATO must guarantee that inalienable right to  life, and if they cannot, the world must establish the necessary  mechanism and unite its forces to that end.    What is now happening in Bosnia-Herzegovina is a reign of  terror that must be unconditionally and immediately stopped.  The entire international community is against terrorism and  this terror against innocent people, civilians, must, of course,  be stopped by the appropriate action. How to achieve that?  There are two ways to stop terror and aggression: One is to  carry out immediate air strikes against the aggressor, or, if  the world cannot agree to that, we must lift the arms embargo so  that the Bosnians can defend themselves. In the last two years,  Turkey has been doing everything to reactivate the UN and NATO  regarding the problem. We must preserve traditional values,  principles of the international law and norms of civilized  behavior.    [Zvizdic] How do you evaluate political relations between  Turkey and the Bosnia-Herzegovina Muslim leadership? Do you  think the local Muslim leadership does not take your advice with  regard to stopping the war and finding solutions through peace  negotiations?    [Ciller] Turkey is playing the role of a mediator between  Croatia and the Bosniaks, and both sides trust our country and  its Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin. He maintains contact with  Mr. Silajdzic and Mr. Granic, and I think they will soon meet  again. Turkey does not offer ready-made solutions nor peace  plans, for we do not intend to impose solutions; it is up to the  warring factions whether they will reach an agreement or not.    [Zvizdic] Does Turkey's interest in the situation in  Bosnia-Herzegovina stem from the five-century presence of Turkey  in the Balkans, or has Turkey, as a big country, a military  power, and a member of NATO, been given the task, or that is,  taken up the responsibility to help solve the situation in  Bosnia-Herzegovina?  <H5>  Union Must Be Preserved </H5>   [Ciller] The Turkish public has been following the events in  Bosnia-Herzegovina over n the past two years with great concern,  and I would like to point out that some 4 million Turks are of  Bosnian origin and still have relatives and close family ties in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. What is happening in Bosnia is not a civil  war, as the Serbs are trying to present it; rather, it is open  aggression. It is an occupation by a foreign country, the  spreading out of one ethnic group at the expense of another; it  is imperialism, ethnic cleansing, and genocide. It is not Islam  against Christianity, nor Islamic jihad, or spreading  fundamentalism. The right to self-defense of a country that is  a UN member is being denied. The Turks not only have historical  ties with the Bosnians, but also with the Croats, Macedonians,  Albanians, and the Serbs. Historically, politically, and  culturally, Turkey is a Balkan country.    [Zvizdic] In Bonn, President Tudjman offered the possibility  of a confederal organization between the Republic of Croatia,  the Bosniak-Muslim republic, and the Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia  within the Bosnia-Herzegovina Republic, or just with the  Bosniak-Muslim republic in case the union does not survive. Can  you comment on this offer?    [Ciller] Turkey advocates the territorial integrity of an  independent and sovereign Bosnia-Herzegovina and we think the  union must be preserved. Internationally recognized borders  must be protected from this pure aggression. The multi-ethnic  character of Bosnia-Herzegovina was once the pride of Europe  and, if possible, it must be preserved and cherished. It is  then up to the warring factions to decide on their future.    [Zvizdic] Can you comment on the politics of Croatia  toward Bosnia-Herzegovina.    [Ciller] Croat-Bosnian friendship and mutual trust must be  regained and measures must be taken to that end. Croat-Muslim  conflicts were unjustified and unnecessary.  <H5>  Tudjman and Izetbegovic Are Friends </H5>   [Zvizdic] Do you think the policies of the Muslim leadership  under Mr. Izetbegovic are correct?    [Ciller] Mr. Alija Izetbegovic was elected president of  Bosnia-Herzegovina. We trust him, and think he is a capable and  experienced statesman. He is a friend of Turkey and, to my  knowledge, also an old friend of President Tudjman. Turkey  supports President Izetbegovic and his Prime Minister Silajdzic  and their sound policies for reaching a just, honest, and  lasting peace.    [Zvizdic] Could the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina end this year?  And in the light of that, how do you evaluate the role of the  broader international community?    [Ciller] The war in Bosnia has been going on for too long:  200,000 Bosnians have lost their lives, 500,000 have been  wounded, 1 million are in exile. A terrible price for  preserving Bosnian independence and sovereignty. However, I  hope this year will be the year of reconciliation,  understanding, and peace. Many things indicate that this could  happen, but a lasting peace can be established only if it is  just for all parties involved. The international community is  present throughout the peace process, but peace efforts will  succeed only if the formula for peace is acceptable to all  sides. Only the warring factions can establish peace, and the  participation of the international community is here necessary,  but it can be marginal as well.</p>

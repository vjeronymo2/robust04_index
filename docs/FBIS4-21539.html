			<p>BFN     [Text] A news conference was held yesterday [23 March] at  the DPRK Embassy in Moscow. DPRK Ambassador Son Song-pil  briefed Russian reporters on the DPRK Foreign Ministry  spokesman's statement regarding the rupture of DPRK-U.S. talks.    Ambassador Son Song-pil pointed out that Pyongyang cannot  but  take countermeasures against pressure on resuming Team Spirit,  an ROK-U.S. joint military exercise.    Last March, the DPRK declared its decision to withdraw from  the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT], but temporarily  suspended its effectuation of such a decision last July so as to  resume talks with the United States.    He pointed out that the DPRK cannot but implement its  decision to withdraw from the NPT if the U.S. Administration  breaks up talks with Pyongyang and resumes the Team Spirit  exercise to step up the nuclear threat against the North.    He added: Continuing dialogue is also in the interest of the  United States. We are not in any hurry as time is on our side.</p>

			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / International Company News: Hagemeyer sees slowdown after 25% increase HAGEMEYER, the Netherlands-based international trading company, reported a 25 per cent climb in first-half net profit to Fl 42.1m (Dollars 26.6m) from Fl 33.6m during the same period a year earlier, writes David Brown in Amsterdam. However, the company expected its growth rate to moderate during the second half, due to the weakening outlook for the European consumer electronics and automotive markets and instability of the US dollar exchange rate. Consolidated net turnover advanced by 28 per cent to Fl 1.61bn from Fl 1.25bn, the bulk of which was accounted for by new acquisitions. Organic growth in existing business was just over 3 per cent. Operating profit advanced at the same 28 per cent rate to Fl 83.1m from Fl 64.4m. Hagemeyer, 60 per cent controlled by First Pacific, the Hong Kong investment group, said its recent acquisition of Froschl of Germany gave a particular impetus to growth. Froschl, Germany's leading electo-technical wholesale group, benefited from heavy new infrastructure investments in the former east Germany. ***** TOPDANMARK, the Danish banking and insurance group, said it expected its performance for the second half of 1992 to be at least as good as the first half of the year, when it recorded a DKr126.5m (Dollars 23.4m) pre-tax profit, writes Our Correspondent in Copenhagen. Topdanmark's whole year 1991 group pre-tax loss was DKr273m. The first half 1991 pre-tax profit was DKr120.8m. The group's rationalisation programme would continue to contribute positively to the overall group result in the second half of the year, along with expected improved earnings by its Activbanken banking unit. It said that these positive indicators would be offset to a certain extent by increased loan loss provisions in Activbanken, coupled with group share portfolio losses and an expected rise in claims in the insurance division. Topdanmark said its sale of 27.08 per cent of its shares to Eureko, a recently set up Netherlands-based joint insurance venture, had been a lucrative transaction. Eureko is a joint insurance venture between Denmark's Topdanmark, Britain's Friends Provident Life Office, Sweden's Wasa Insurance Group, and the Netherlands' Cooperati Avero/Centraal Beheer Group. Topdanmark is Denmark's third biggest insurance group. ***** SOPHUS BERENDSEN, the Danish holding company, announced increased first-half 1992 group pre-tax profits of DKr613.88m (Dollars 113.6m), writes Our Correspondent in Copenhagen. It expects solid growth in profits for the whole year, despite difficult trading conditions. Berendsen's first-half 1991 group pre-tax profits were DKr459.89m and pre-tax profits for the whole of last year were DKr973m. Berendsen attributed its good first half-year result mainly to a strong performance by Rentokil, the group's British-based pest control and environmental services subsidiary. Rentokil last week announced first-half 1992 pre-tax profits of Pounds 42.3m (Dollars 84.36m), compared with Pounds 34.5m in the same period in 1991. Berendsen said cost-saving schemes in its industrial distribution unit had also helped overall group performance, along with solid progress by its new Netherlands-based textile service subsidiary.</p>

Mustapha Tawoukji received a $500 check and a plaque Monday at the United  Nations in New York. The competition, organized by Lions Clubs International,  was on the theme "Peace Will Help Us Grow" and drew entries from more than 49  countries. Mustapha's winning poster depicts a white dove flying over a rose.  The young student at the Makased School Alhorj for Boys was accompanied to New  York by his mother and a sister. He received a standing ovation when he was  introduced by Lions Club International President Austin P. Jennings, who said  the organization's first peace poster contest had been won by someone who had  "never known peace during his lifetime."ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Andrey Vaganov: "Trial of Chemical Scientist </F> Resumed: Solidarity of Colleagues and Public Support Needed"]    [Text]  <H5>  The Trial </H5>   The hearing of the case charging Vil Mirzayanov, a Russian  chemical scientist, with divulging a state secret is supposed to  resume today at the Moscow city court. He is charged with  publishing an article in coauthorship with another chemist, Lev  Fedorov, in the newspaper MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI, in which he made  public facts concerning a new type of chemical weapon--a binary  weapon.    In accordance with the new Russian Constitution (Article 15,  Paragraph 3), the list of reports containing a state secret is  defined by federal law. Up to the present time, such a  publication of the federal law does not exist. It is for this  reason that on 24 January 1994 Vil Mirzayanov refused to appear  in court voluntarily, justifying this refusal by a reluctance to  participate in an anticonstitutional trial.    On the eve of the resumption of the court examination, a  whole number of public and political organizations came out with  statements in support of Mirzayanov. Thus, the executive  committee of the Russia's Choice electoral association and a  faction of the same name in the State Duma of the Russian  Federation in a statement expressed the hope that the Moscow  city court will in a very short time complete the examination of  the Mirzayanov case and pronounce a verdict of not guilty.    Nikolay Vorontsov, chairman of the subcommittee for science  of the Committee for Education, Culture, and Science of the  State Duma of the Russian Federation, believes that the trial of  the chemical scientist is an attempt to return to those times  when a state of fear and terror reigned in society. In his  words, the situation regarding the arrest of Vil Mirzayanov  reminds him of 1970, when the geneticist scientist Zhores  Medvedev was put into a psychiatric hospital in Kaluga for his  book about Lysenko.    "Chemical and ecological scientists should play a big role  in  the current situation," thinks Nikolay Vorontsov. "If necessary,  on their part it should come to rather tough sanctions with  respect to the authoritative structures."    However, Mirzayanov's colleagues at present prefer not to  actively advertise their attitude toward the court trial.  Although, in the words of Nikolay Vorontsov, the president of  the Russian Academy of Sciences Yuriy Osipov expressed his  personal point of view and condemned Mirzayanov's prosecution.    "If the chemical scientists do not come out in defense of  their colleague, I do not know whether they will be invited to  international conferences," Mr. Vorontsov emphasized.    Interesting in this connection is the statement of Lev  Fedorov that the case of his coauthor began to unravel after  Doctor of Chemical Sciences Viktor Petrunin wrote a denunciation  to State Security addressed to the chief of the Economic  Security Administration.    But while the chemical scientists are thinking about what  position to take in this situation, even more fundamental  measures are being proposed. If things are called by their  proper names, this is blackmail and threats to divulge state  secrets. The example of Vladimir Uglev (see NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA  of 28 January 1994) proved to be infectious, as could be  expected. The seed fell on fertile soil. Valeriya Novodvorskaya  issued an ultimatum: If Vil Mirzayanov is not released by 10  February, she will pass information to the West concerning three  developments that constitute a state secret. It is well known  that our country was one of the most closed. So that for more  than 70 years quite enough secrets accumulated, and there are  enough state secrets for everyone. But there always have been  more than enough people in Russia who like to scratch their name  in the annals of history with a little nail.</p>

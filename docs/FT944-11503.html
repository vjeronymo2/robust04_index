			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Finance and the Family: Houses prices flat - At a glance House prices were unchanged in October, the Halifax Building Society price index shows. After a rise of just 0.1 per cent in September, the figures confirm that the underlying trend in prices remains broadly flat. Halifax said that it expected this trend to continue until consumer confidence improved. Prices paid by first time buyers fell by 0.8 per cent in October, and are now 1.2 per cent lower than October last year. The price of new houses rose by 1.2 per cent last month after a fall of 4.6 per cent in September. Conversely, the Nationwide building society's index rose of 0.7 per cent in October, after a fall of 3 per cent in September.</p>

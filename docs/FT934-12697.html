			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / Spanish interest rates warning SPAIN'S economy and finance minister, Mr Pedro Solbes, has warned that benchmark interest rates in Spain, now at a historic low of 9.25 per cent following cuts last week, are unlikely to fall further in the immediate future. In an interview with the Madrid business newspaper Expansion to be published today, Mr Solbes said: 'In the present conditions we have pretty well reached the limit on interest rate reductions. It is difficult to determine the absolute limit but we are pretty close to it.' He added, however, that external factors such as a further cut in French interest rates and a fall in German inflation could give Spain's monetary authorities 'a certain room for manoeuvre'. The only domestic factor that would allow rates to be lowered, Mr Solbes said, would be agreement on pay restraint and on reform of labour market rigidities. Discussions between the government, employers and unions on an incomes policy and on the labour laws are due to begin tomorrow. Mr Solbes said that although the government preferred to negotiate these issues it would act unilaterally if necessary.</p>

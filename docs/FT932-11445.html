			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / International Company News: Ems-Chemie offers to repurchase shares EMS-CHEMIE, the speciality chemical group led by the controversial Swiss politician Mr Christoph Blocher, is offering to buy back and cancel up to 36 per cent of its bearer shares for SFr550m (Dollars 383.5m). The move is the latest in the group's unusual strategy of distributing excess cash flow. Mr Blocher is sceptical of acquisitions and diversification and believes the company should stick to its business, rather than be a fund manager as well. Last year, the group repaid a portion of the nominal value of the bearer shares to shareholders in lieu of a dividend. This year's buy-back offer, also in lieu of a dividend, takes advantage of last year's revisions to Swiss company law permitting such purchases. The offer, at SFr2,200 per share for up to 250,000 of the 689,646 bearer shares, represents a SFr200 premium on the market price at Friday's close. BZ Bank Zurich, which is advising Ems, said the offer would not be of interest to individual shareholders because they would have to pay 35 per cent withholding tax on the difference between the buy-back price and the SFr100 nominal value of the shares. Corporations pay tax only on the difference between book value and the offer price. Individuals could realise the offer premium without having to face a heavy tax burden by selling in the market. If the offer were fully subscribed, Mr Blocher's share of the capital, in the form of registered shares, would rise from 18.45 per cent to 26.2 per cent and his voting power from 53.1 per cent to 64 per cent.</p>

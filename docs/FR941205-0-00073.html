			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Several other provisions [in section 502(b)(6)] are included to ensure fair treatment in the permit process. For example, we make clear that judicial review of final actions by the permitting authority to issue or deny permits shall be available in State court to anyone who could obtain such review under any applicable law. This provision ensures that existing provisions of law governing the availability of review of final actions on permit applications are in no way limited, and that interested parties who arguably are affected by permit decisions are guaranteed their day in court.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Chafee-Baucus Statement of Senate Managers, S.1630, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> reprinted <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in 136 Cong. Rec. S169941 (daily ed. October 27, 1990). This language, together with the expansive language of section 502(b)(6), demonstrates the clear intent of the Congress to provide citizens a broad opportunity for judicial review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, if EPA were to implement an operating permits program pursuant to section 502(d)(3) of the Act, citizens would have access to judicial review of EPA permitting decisions if they met the minimal standing requirements of Article III. With respect to the nature of the injury that an ``interested person'' must show to have standing under Article III, the Supreme Court held in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Sierra Club v. Morton, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  405 U.S. 727, 734&hyph;35 (1972), that harm to an economic interest is not required to confer standing. Harm to an aesthetic, environmental, or recreational interest is sufficient, as long as the party seeking judicial review is among the injured. This holding was reaffirmed by the Supreme Court in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  504 U.S. __, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 2136, 119 L.Ed.2d 351, 365&hyph;66 (1992).

National Sea Clammers Ass'n, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  453 U.S. 1, 16&hyph;17 (1981) (citizen suit provision of CWA intended by Congress to apply to plaintiffs suffering noneconomic and economic injury).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter observed that in addition to the constitutional requirements for standing, ``prudential'' standing requirements would apply where a Federal court reviews an EPA-issued permit. The prudential standing inquiry requires that a court ask whether a would-be challenger to Agency action is pursuing an ``interest'' arguably within the zone of interests Congress intended to either regulate or protect.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Hazardous Waste Treatment Council v. EPA (HWTC IV), <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  885 F.2d 918, 922 (D.C. Cir. 1989). EPA has considered the issue and has determined that it agrees with the commenter that courts should apply traditional prudential standing requirements to parties seeking judicial review pursuant to section 502(b)(6).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Id <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . at 921. However, by requiring that States provide an opportunity for judicial review to,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> inter alia, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  ``any person who participated in the public comment process'' on a proposed permit, Congress declared that any such person is within the zone of interests addressed by title V. Thus, EPA believes that the Act clearly enables such persons to meet prudential standing requirements. In Virginia, however, all persons who have participated in the public comment process are not considered within the zone of interests protected by title V. Accordingly, the Commonwealth's standing provision is more restrictive than traditional prudential standing requirements. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  Hazardous Waste Treatment Council v. Thomas (HWTC II), <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  861 F.2d 277 (D.C.

The commenters believe that Congress cannot preempt a traditional State power with the ambiguous language of section 502(b)(6) and that Congress cannot coerce State legislative action. Additionally, these commenters contend that the sanctions provisions in section 502(d)(2) of the Act unconstitutionally compel the States to enact and enforce the title V permits program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> EPA Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Commonwealth and the contesting commenters assert that EPA's interpretation of section 502(b)(6) of the Act is an invasion of State sovereignty in violation of the Tenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. They assert that Congress cannot require States to regulate. However, EPA does not believe that the Clean Air Act, and more specifically section 502(b)(6), is an unconstitutional invasion of State sovereignty.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

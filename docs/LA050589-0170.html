			<p><P> May 5, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BRITAIN OUSTS 3 S. AFRICANS OVER IRISH ARMS SALES PLOT  </P> <P> Britain expelled three South African diplomats today because of their country's  reputed role in a plot to sell arms to Northern Ireland extremists in exchange  for British-made missile parts.  </P> <P> The Foreign Office said Undersecretary Patrick Wright summoned South African  Ambassador Rae Killen and told him the three must leave the country within a  week.  </P> <P> "We noted their expression of regret," a statement quoted Wright as telling  Killen. "However, the South African government should be under no illusions  about the grave concern with which Her Majesty's government viewed the  involvement by South African officials in this affair."  </P> <P> The move came two weeks after authorities in Paris arrested a South African  diplomat, an American arms dealer and three members of an extreme Protestant  organization in Northern Ireland. The Northern Irish allegedly were handing  over parts of a Blowpipe, a sophisticated shoulder-fired, anti-aircraft missile  manufactured in Belfast.  </P> <P> The British government expressed grave concern over allegations that the South  Africans were supplying weapons to the Protestants in exchange for the missile  parts.  </P> <P> The South African, identified by French sources as Daniel Storm, was released  after he claimed diplomatic immunity.  </P></p>

			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Survey of Czech Republic (10): On the track of new markets - Profile, CKD FROM the top of a hill overlooking Prosek, on the outskirts of Prague, the sprawling rows of CKD's factories stretch across the landscape below. With a biblical wave of the arm, Mr Jaroslav Skrhak, finance director, explains: 'All this is CKD. The land just below also used to belong to CKD but we sold it.' Senior managers of the group, which is one of the Czech Republic's largest manufacturers, proudly relate the company's achievements since its beginning 122 years ago as a small workshop with the grand title of First Bohemian-Moravian Engineering Works. 'We are the world's largest producer of tramways, and our production of diesel engines for locomotives is comparable to that of General Electric,' says Mr Skrhak. Over the years, CKD has made locomotives, trams, engines, cars, airplanes, heavy electrical machinery, compressors, mining and construction machinery, industrial and military equipment. But the collapse of the former communist regimes and the death of the Comecon trade bloc has robbed CKD of the bulk of its markets, while the recession has made it that much more difficult to switch production and exports to new markets. 'We exported mainly to the Comecon and developing countries, so to change our markets is an important part of our restructuring. We entered western markets, but got into trouble because of the recession. We just arrived too late,' Mr Skrhak says. In spite of making a small profit of CzK1.1bn on turnover of CzK14.9bn in 1991 - figures for last year are not yet available - the group faces difficult times and restructuring is proving a painful process. Since October 1990, CKD's workforce has been reduced from 40,000 to 17,500 today, and more job losses are likely. Mr Skrhak says such a radical cut in jobs was possible only because there is practically no unemployment in the Prague area. The group's problems were exacerbated by a rising mountain of unpaid bills of CzK7.2bn (Dollars 250m) by customers at the end of last year, with debts from the former Soviet Union in excess of CzK4bn. From a single Dollars 205m Soviet contract signed in 1991 for 200 locomotives, only Dollars 75m has been paid, and the chances of recovering the rest are practically non-existent. Unpaid bills by domestic customers are another problem, though Mr Skrhak says this was at its worse in 1990-91, and the company has since adjusted production to limit supplies to bad debtors and many have begun to pay. 'Without the (Russian) debt we would not need any government help,' he says. Mr Jan Havelka, managing director and CKD board chairman, says it is ironic that the former Soviet states desperately need to improve their transport infrastructure, while CKD which can supply such equipment is forced to sack workers and borrow money to survive. To overcome its crisis, CKD has adopted a two-pronged strategy based on raising fresh money to meet immediate and medium-term restructuring costs, and on deepening its restructuring programme with the help of foreign partners and through privatisation. The government recently agreed in principle for a CzK1.3bn cash injection to be provided by a bank consortium, and the company is hoping to raise up to Dollars 60m on the international capital markets. Separately, the company says it would be willing to transfer production and technology for transport equipment to Russia and to provide the necessary technicians, if international financial institutions were willing to pick up at least part of the Russian debt. Meanwhile, the company's exports to the Middle East are rising, and it has big contracts for transport systems in Brazil and the Philippines Two joint ventures - with Secheron of Switzerland for transport equipment with a total investment of CzK140m, and with Herbiger of Austria to make control equipment for pumps - with planned investment of CzK80m, were agreed last year.</p>

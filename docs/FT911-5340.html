			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / Letter: Night deliveries could bolster company margins Sir, The prospect of road prices, as represented in Richard Tomkins' article, presents an evil spectre to a transport industry already dogged by fuel and VAT increases. Often cited as an indicator of the state of the UK economy as a whole, the fact that many of the industry's stalwarts (such as John Dee Group, Rockwood and Hunter Distribution ) have gone to the wall, gives something of an impression of the state of the market. The cost to the economy of congestion, cited by the Confederation of British Industry, must be compared to the costs of road pricing which, in the case of commercial concerns, will inevitably be passed on to their customers and, in turn, their consumers. My guess is the road pricing will certainly be no cheaper - even if, as seems likely, its responsibility is hoisted on to the private sector. It is true that the era in which traffic growth can be accommodated by conventional means is coming to an end. Roads in Britain are fast becoming a finite resource. A more imaginative use of the resource, therefore, is surely the key. Lynx has actively encouraged its customers to adopt night-time deliveries. Although such a measure has been slow to take root, we are hoping it will gradually gain acceptance - particularly in the retailing and manufacturing sectors, where margins are equally under pressure. Widespread acceptance of such initiatives is in the greater interests of the UK economy. Forcing commercial concerns off the roads is not. Martin E.

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Central Committee of the Arab Liberation Front  [ALF] has condemned the signing of the Gaza-Jericho agreement  between the PLO and the Zionist entity.    A spokesman for the ALF Central Committee has stated that  the  ALF condemns this agreement, announces that it rejects it, and  that it will not comply with all that results from it. This is  because this agreement is the result of successive concessions  that began at Madrid and continued until the Gaza-Jericho  agreement was reached.    The statement [as heard] said: We are confident that such  agreements cannot cancel our historic right to our entire  homeland or prevent our people from continuing their struggle as  part of a comprehensive Arab confrontation that will undoubtedly  come under the banner of the immortal Mother of Battles led by  the nation's knight and hero and the Arab mujahid leader, Saddam  Husayn.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Voluntary Disclosures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To address concerns that in many cases the disclosure process fails to achieve its intended purpose due to the high volume of information included in the disclosure document, the Commission is proposing a format for disclosure documents under which ``voluntary'' disclosures,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , those not required by Commission rules <FOOTCITE> <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 48 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> </FOOTCITE>  or those of other regulators, would be required to be placed in the disclosure document after all relevant required disclosures. Proposed Rule 4.24(v) would require all information, other than that required by the Commission, the antifraud provisions of the Act, and any federal or state securities laws and regulations, to appear following the related required disclosures. Such ``voluntary information'' could not be misleading in content or presentation or inconsistent with required disclosures. In addition, voluntary information would be subject to the antifraud provisions of the Act and the regulations thereunder and to rules regarding the use of promotional material promulgated by a registered futures association pursuant to section 17(j) of the Act. This format is designed to accommodate the apparent desire of some CPOs and CTAs to include in disclosure documents information that is not required under the Commission's rules or those of other regulators, while assuring that core disclosures are given due prominence. Naturally, CPOs and CTAs would continue to be subject to the antifraud prohibitions of sections 4b and 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> o <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 6b and 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> o <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 49 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  with respect to all disclosures, including disclosures voluntarily provided.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 48 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> CFTC-required disclosures include information required by Rules 4.21(h) (proposed to be renumbered as Rule 4.24(w)) for CPOs and 4.31(g) (proposed to be renumbered as Rule 4.33( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> o <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> ) for CTAs. These rules require CPOs and CTAs to disclose all material information to existing and prospective pool participants and clients even if the information is not specifically required by Commission rules.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 49 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Generally, section 4b of the Act prohibits fraud in connection with the making of any contract of sale of any commodity for future delivery. Section 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> o <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  of the Act prohibits CPOs, CTAs and their associated persons from employing any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud a pool participant, prospective pool participant or client and from engaging in any transaction, practice or course of business which operates as a fraud or deceit upon such participant or client. In addition, CPOs, CTAs and their associated persons are precluded from representing or implying that they have been sponsored, recommended or approved by the United States or by any agency or officer thereof.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Investee Pools  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed disclosure framework specifically addresses disclosures concerning investee pools. As discussed in the performance section, for purposes of past performance disclosures, investee pools would be treated comparably to CTAs,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , the scope of performance disclosure required would be based on the amount of assets of the offered pool committed to the investee pool. However, a different benchmark for applying the twenty-five percent (as used in the major investee pool definition) and ten percent (for adverse performance disclosure to be required) thresholds is used for investee pools in light of the fact that investments in other pools generally expose the pool only to loss of the initial investment and that the full amount of the investment is required to be paid at the inception of the investment. The relative importance of investee pools to prospective pool participants is thus more appropriately determined by reference to the proportion of the pool's total assets invested in the investee pool. The proposal would streamline other investee pool disclosures to obviate the need for CPOs to substantially incorporate in the document the contents of each investee pool's disclosure document. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 50 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Non-performance disclosure requirements relating to investee pools also would be tailored to take into account the relative importance of the investee pool to the offered pool, as measured by the amount of assets of the pool offered allocated to it. Thus, no disclosures would be required for investee pools allocated less than ten percent of the assets of the pool offered and disclosures with respect to other investee pools would be limited based on the proportion of the pool's assets allocated to them. Specifically, with respect to each investee pool allocated at least ten percent of the assets of the pool offered, the CPO also would be required to disclose its name and that of its CPO and its principals and any conflicts of interest on the part of the investee pool's CPO in respect of the offered pool.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 50 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See note 20  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  and accompanying text.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> With respect to major investee pools,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , those allocated twenty-five percent or more of the assets of the offered pool, the CPO would be required to disclose the business background of, material litigation against, and any ownership in the pool offered on the part of its CPO and its principals. In addition, the use of proceeds, risk factors, fees and expense, and redemption sections of the document would call for specific information relative to investments in investee pools. Risk disclosure relative to investee pools would be required because investments in investee pools may create both the risks inherent in the investee pool's own investments and liquidity risks due to restrictions upon redemption of the investment in the investee pool. Fees and expenses may accrue at each level of a multi-tier structure and should be disclosed. Investments in investee pools with redemption periods different from those of the pool offered or with minimum ``lock-in'' provisions <FOOTCITE> <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 51 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> </FOOTCITE>  may affect the ability of that pool to promptly honor redemption requests from its participants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 51 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Certain pools lock in initial investments for a specified period before allowing any redemptions. There are no rules requiring availability of redemption of pool interests in very short timeframes as for investment companies, hence the added importance of volatility disclosure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From MAINICHI SHIMBUN 21 January Evening Edition] </F>   [Text] The government on 20 January firmed up the outline  of the economic stimulus package to be finalized next week. It  envisages investing more than 3 trillion yen in projects to  procure public-use land, to assist small and medium businesses,  and to expand loans by the Housing Finance Corporation [HFC].  The total will come to almost 7 trillion yen if about 3.5  trillion yen's worth of public works projects are added to it.  In addition, there will be measures to boost the financial and  security markets, one of which is to provide financial  assistance for clearing bad debts. If some 7 trillion yen's  worth of measures to reduce income taxes and residents' taxes  are added, the total comes to about 14.7 trillion yen, which  means the stimulus package will be the biggest ever, surpassing  that of April last year.    The new economic measures contain a key project aimed at  improving liquidity of land, and the project will require  investment of 500 billion yen to 1 trillion yen to promote  acquisition of land for public use. Specifically, this means  additional appropriation of funds for the Housing and Urban  Development Corporation to acquire land for future housing  construction. It will also provide funds for local housing  corporations to pay for interest accrued from land purchases.  The government is also considering reducing the tax on profits  from land transfer.    To support small and medium businesses, ceilings on  low-interest loans by such government-run financial institutions  as the Small Business Finance Corporation and People's Finance  Corporation will be extended to enable more of them to benefit  from the loans. In the area of measures to promote employment,  a new system will be created to help job-creating small and  medium industries expand their plant and equipment. A total of  1,300 billion yen will be made available in this area.    Where loans by the Housing Finance Corporation are  concerned,  an additional 100,000 housing units received benefits under the  emergency economic measures effected in September last year, and  the number of housing units eligible for HFC loans expanded to a  total of 700,000 in 1993. In order to further promote  investments in housing construction and to make it the prime  mover in pulling the economy ahead, additional loans for 70,000  housing units -- worth more than 1 trillion yen -- will be made  available under the new package of economic measures.</p>

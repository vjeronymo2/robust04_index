			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Knin, May 4 (TANJUG) -- Senior military official of  the Army of the Republic of Serb Krajina (R.S.K.) General Mile  Novakovic warned on Wednesday that patrols and reconnaissance  groups of the Croatian Army in the area of Northern Dalmatia  ("Sector South") occasionally entered the buffer zone and so  violated an agreement between the R.S.K. and Croatia on the  cessation of hostilities and on the disengagement of forces.    General Novakovic, president of the R.S.K. Committee for the  Implementation of the Agreement, informed the head of the U.N.  Protection Force (UNPROFOR) observer team, General Bastijans,  about this during their talks in Knin, the political center of  the R.S.K.    The talks were initiated by General Bastijans, General  Novakovic told TANJUG.    Novakovic added that General Bastijans was warned about the  Croatian Army transports in the zones subject to transport  control, and about the presence of Croatian heavy weapons in the  areas covered by the agreement.    The agreement, which took effect on April 4, provides for  the  two warring sides to withdraw their infantry one kilometer from  the disengagement line and for UNPROFOR members to enter the  buffer zone. It also provides for the R.S.K. and Croatia to pull  out their heavy weaponry (mortars) 10 km and artillery and tanks  20 km from the front line.    According to General Novakovic, it was specified during the  talks that U.N. military observers were the only ones in charge  of control of the implementation of the agreement on the  Croatian side.    Novakovic said they agreed during the talks that U.N.  military observers were obliged to uncover possible preparations  of the Croatian side for any military actions. The ceasefire  agreement envisages such an obligation, which was not in the  UNPROFOR mandate before this agreement.    The military observers pointed out they did not want to be  remembered by failing to accomplish their mission, said General  Novakovic.    The R.S.K. was formed in 1991 in the territory of Croatia  populated by the Serbs in response to Croatia's secession from  the former Yugoslavia and its attempt to reduce the status of  Serb people to that of a national minority. The R.S.K. was  proclaimed a U.N. Protected Area (UNPA) in March 1992.</p>

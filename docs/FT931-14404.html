			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Lamont account of anonymous gift 'tenable' MPS SHOULD include anonymous gifts when they are registering their financial interests, and should not simply regard ignorance of the donor's identities as a reason for not admitting them, a cross-party Commons committee said yesterday. But the inquiry by the MPs' interests committee into complaints against Mr Norman Lamont concluded that no action by the Commons should be taken against the chancellor. The inquiry centred on Mr Lamont's failure to declare the anonymous gift of Pounds 18,400 towards the legal costs of evicting an unsatisfactory tenant from his London home Its report said that in the absence of any clear ruling on the issue, Mr Lamont's interpretation of the rules on interests was 'tenable'. He took the view that he did not need to declare the gift because, as he did not know its source, it could not be thought to affect his conduct. Mr Lamont's aides shrugged off suggestions that the chancellor's judgment had been criticised, but the report triggered renewed opposition attacks. Mr Alan Beith, the Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, said that the committee had 'let Mr Lamont off on a technicality', and Labour renewed demands for the government to consult the Commons about new rules on payments to ministers. The committee issued a strong warning about anonymous gifts, saying they 'have the potential to be more compromising' to MPs and the public than those where the donor is identified. 'Prudence suggests that a member of parliament should not normally accept a gift or benefit profferred anonymously,' it said. It also recommended that MPs seek guidance on which payments should be registered. The senior officials involved in deciding the Treasury's connection to Mr Lamont's bill will be questioned by MPs tomorrow. The session with the public accounts committee, which monitors government spending, will include a rare appearance by the cabinet secretary, Sir Robin Butler.</p>

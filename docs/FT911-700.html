			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / International Company News: Japanese retailer in Time Warner cinemas link-up TIME WARNER, the US media and entertainment company, yesterday announced the formation of a Y1bn (Dollars 7.24m) joint venture company with a Japanese retailer, Nichii, to develop the country's first multi-screen cinema complexes. The companies have agreed that the equally-owned joint venture company, Warner MyCal, will develop and manage up to 30 cinema complexes in shopping centres run by the ambitious Osaka-based retailer, which has longer-term hopes to create entertainment software. Japanese land prices have been a serious problem for foreign companies attempting to establish large-scale operations in Japan, and the Nichii partnership will give Time Warner access to valuable sites in suburban Japan. Nichii is attempting to overhaul its image as a provincial supermarket operator by developing shopping complexes with fitness centres and fashion boutiques. By linking with Warner, the Japanese company hopes that a little bit of Hollywood glamour will rub off on to its reputation. Mr Robert Daly, chairman of Warner Bros, suggested that the deal represented a 'great milestone in Japan for American business and the international entertainment industry,' and would 'make going to the movies even more fun for Japanese people'. The companies reckoned the average American visits a cinema four times a year, while in Japan the figure is 1.2 visits a year. Part of the problem, they said, is that Japan has only 1,700 movie screens, compared with 23,000 in the US. Warner will design the complexes and operate the theatres, which will be similar to those built by the company in Europe and Australia, while Nichii will supervise the construction on some of its 150 outlets and, if necessary, acquire new sites. Mr Toshimine Kobayashi, president of Nichii and the chairman of Warner MyCal, said the new complexes would increase patronage and offer 'lifestyle alternatives' to the young. He also suggested that tofu flakes, which his company produces, could be sold in the cinemas along with, or in place of, popcorn. The complexes will have from six to 12 screens, and the partners plan to show films well after the traditional 6pm final screening in suburban Japan.</p>

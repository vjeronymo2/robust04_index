			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Norman's conquest Mr Archie Norman may get quiet satisfaction from knowing that his gloomy predictions about the UK grocery sector have proved much more accurate than the sunny forecasts coming from his older rivals. But that will prove cold comfort unless Asda rings up higher sales as a result of his analysis. On that score, there is room for only modest encouragement about Asda's long-term future, despite its strong half-year numbers. A 9 per cent rise in same store sales, with almost no benefit from price inflation, is an impressive achievement; the 14 per cent rise in operating profits even more so. The new Asda team continues to make textbook progress, lifting staff productivity, improving product mix, strengthening the distribution chain and renovating the older stores. How satisfying it must be to exploit under-utilised assets, especially when coming from such a low profits base. This renewal programme has a fair bit further to run. But at some point, the recovery momentum will stall. Asda will then have to prove it has a trading format capable of growing in the 1990s. The launch of the Dales discount chain is hopeful. The infusion of Pounds 700m of equity also provides the financial muscle for Asda to fund its ambitions. But Asda can no longer rely on its competitors running their businesses as though they lingered in the 1980s. J. Sainsbury's latest price offensive shows how determined the market leader is to claw back Asda's recent advantage. The market will grow far tougher from here on in.</p>

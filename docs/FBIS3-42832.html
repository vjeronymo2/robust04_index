In 1992 Volodymyr Pylypchuk was elected  deputy chairman of the Economic Committee of the Parliamentary  Assembly of NBSYe [[expansion not given]. Since the first day of  Ukraine's political independence, he has consistently called for  securing Ukraine's economic independence through radical  economic reforms.    Today Volodymyr Pylypchuk is also involved in coordinating  the training of free-market economists to take the place of  officials currently in office following the 27 March election.    [Levytskyy] A great deal has already been said about the  state of the Ukrainian economy. Unfortunately, skeptical and  negativistic views prevail. Some politicians have gone so far as  to "predict" how much longer our independent state will survive.  I have asked you to give me this interview because you belong to  that circle of people who continue to believe in economic  reforms and envisage great prospects for Ukraine as a prosperous  state.    [Pylypchuk] We all need a healthy dose of optimism. If we  accept the opposite notion, that "everything is heading towards  the end, towards collapse," we are still left with the question:  and what then? What should we tell people to do--head for the  cemetery?..    If we view our problems from a philosophical vantage point,  we know that every decline is followed by a rise. It is assured  by people who know what needs to be done and how to do it. The  Commission on Economic Reform and Management of the National  Economy has a conception for overcoming the crisis, a program  for halting inflation, conducting accelerated privatization,  developing a market infrastructure, stabilizing the economy, and  introducing a monetary unit.    The first thing we need to do is halt inflation. But to do  so, we have to eliminate the budget deficit. Our program calls  for revoking all tax benefits except those granted to  organizations of invalids, who are unable to compete with  able-bodied people. We must change the tax base and switch to  taxing turnover or sales volumes. It is also important to lower  taxes. This will cause the business activity index to rise and  ultimately replenish the budget. Business enterprise will expand  and firms that have registered where taxes are lower will return  to Ukraine.    Our program envisages conducting privatization and receiving  a portion of the earnings from this. This will result in  reducing the expenditure side of the budget because the state  will stop financing private organizations. As a consequence of  this policy, branch ministries, committees, concerns, and their  local organs will be eliminated. The third important element in  reducing budget expenditures is to decrease spending on the  upkeep of the armed forces. Ukraine currently maintains a rather  large army. This army must be transformed into a professional  force and then made smaller and more efficient.    Inasmuch as Ukraine has a negative foreign trade balance, we  have worked out a mechanism for eliminating the deficit in  foreign trade. This can be achieved by increasing exports, which  is also linked with privatization. Privatization is the only  thing that can serve as an incentive for work, an incentive to  increase output and improve production quality. It is also  necessary to revoke export licenses and lower import duties. To  prevent exports from being sold at dumping prices, we must  introduce economic regulation.    To overcome the current crisis, it is important to convert  and reconvert the military-industrial complex and sell weapons.  The whole world trades in arms in compliance with the  regulations established by the world community.    [Levytskyy] An important element in Ukrainian reforms must  be  decreasing imports. What do we need to do to achieve this?    [Pylypchuk] We need to recooperate the national economy to  enable us to produce domestically the goods that are now being  imported from abroad. It is also essential for us to allow the  sale of facilities producing unfinished production by tender (on  condition that products that are in short supply in Ukraine are  manufactured here). To restrict nonvital imports, we need to  pursue a wise isolationist policy and focus on buying raw  materials and high technologies. The state must renounce  conducting trade. Private businessmen will maintain the proper  balance--that is, they will buy only as much as they can afford  for the money they earn from sales. In addition, we must  intensify our search for minerals, especially fuel resources,  and pump deeper for oil and gas on existing fields.    [Levytskyy] In a market economy, there must be a balance  between the supply of goods and the supply of money. Is this  difficult to achieve with the kind of disequilibrium in the  economy that we are currently experiencing?    [Pylypchuk] In order to balance the supplies of goods and  money, we must treat land, factories, and plants as goods,  prohibit the issue of credit if there are no goods and financing  when the balance is in the red, as well as the sale of reserve  funds by the National Bank in the form of credits.    [Levytskyy] Representatives of government structures often  stress that the crisis is the result of objective  circumstances--of the fact that the structure of the Ukrainian  economy is so tied to Moscow. How much of today's crisis is  caused by postimperial objective conditions and how much by  officialdom's subjective actions?    [Pylypchuk] If someone needs to explain the reason for  failure, he will always find an excuse. The easiest way is to  blame external factors. No one denies that these exist, but one  must always look to oneself for the cause. Today's situation is  the result of a failure to implement reforms, of pursuing a  zigzagging and inconsistent economic policy.    [Levytskyy] One frequently hears that Ukraine has lost her  chance. I disagree with the skeptics, but will it take our  country a very long time to make its way out of this crisis?    [Pylypchuk] We are quite capable of reforming our economy.  There are methods and mechanisms that would allow us to do so  rapidly. Ukraine's potential is sufficient to halt production  decline in 1994 and begin building up the national economy. All  we need is the will and a new way of thinking.    [Levytskyy] Representatives of government structures have  another excuse for their failures: the price of energy supplies  has increased 10,000-fold since 1990. Their opponents say that  in 1990, a metric ton of oil cost 10 cents, which is not true.  Can you explain this discrepancy?    [Pylypchuk] This is both true and false. I recall that  before  the crisis, a metric ton of Russian oil cost 12 dollars. Today's  price is eight times as great. But the multiplying effect has  also comes into play. When the costs of raw materials rise,  these costs are multiplied in processing, in the production of  Group A products, Group B products, and in the retail trade. The  law of multiplication is in operation, as in calculating the  gross social product. On top of this, there are internal factors  of inflation.    The external factor in inflation could have been  neutralized.  We sold Russia a certain amount of metal, grain, and meat. A  wise government should have made an agreement: we will sell you  a package of goods, but if your price rises, ours will rise  accordingly. Then the price shock would not have been as strong.  But some in our government did not know or understand this,  while others were openly working to collapse Ukraine's economy.    Let me just say that the situation in Ukraine is quite  different from that in the former countries of the socialist  bloc. For example, Poland has a monolithic society, which never  wanted to be part of the empire. There is a segment of our  society that is very fond of the empire and looks back on it  with nostalgia. Fortunately, time is on our side. People are  beginning to understand that a drowning man's hope of salvation  lies solely in himself.    [Levytskyy] You mentioned nostalgia. Journalists have  learned  that Yu. Zvyahilskyy has agreed to transfer a portion of our  industrial projects to Russia in exchange for our debts. What  can you tell us about this contract, and how are such problems  resolved elsewhere in the world?    [Pylypchuk] The general rule is that loans are secured by  property. If they are not paid back, this security goes into  effect and the property is put on the block. Unfortunately, I do  not have all the documents that Zvyahilskyy signed, and so I  cannot draw a firm conclusion regarding this action. I would  like to assure you that Ukraine would be able to engage in trade  without incurring debts with all countries if the state would  hand over the conduct of trade to businessmen. The state should  have no say in what anyone should buy, at what price, with whom  to break ties and with whom to establish ties. Businessmen will  do a much better job of it. Government structures have proved  totally incapable of directing new processes.    [Levytskyy] A conflict broke out in December between the  National Bank and the commercial banks. National Bank officials  assure journalists that had it not been for the National Bank's  timely intervention, the commercial banks would have paralized  the financial system. The heads of commercial banks charge V.  Yushchenko with incompetence and are demanding his resignation.  The arguments put forward by both sides appear persuasive to  nonspecialists. Which side is right?    [Pylypchuk] There is more truth in what the commercial banks  say. Although they, too, are not without sin, because they hold  up the funds of their clients for a time and use them as if this  money were their own. This happens because the National Bank  does not perform the functions with which it has been charged.  There is a decree in force in Ukraine, under which accounts that  are settled late are subject to taxes and a fine. The National  Bank is unable to control this and therefore takes steps that do  not serve the interests of the banking system as a whole, let  alone the specific situation in which Ukraine currently finds  itself. Prohibiting banks to advance credit can be compared to  prohibiting stores to sell goods. This is absurd...    [Levytskyy] Until recently, the so-called money changers  used  to buy up convertible currency at every intersection. For the  last two weeks, we have been witnessing the reverse in Kiev.  They are trying to sell currency. What has caused this abrupt  change?    [Pylypchuk] This phenomenon is linked with the banking  system. As long as the National Bank advanced credits that were  not backed by resources, many people tried to save their money  in hard currency. When the Supreme Council prohibited the  National Bank from issuing money unbacked by resources, the  exchange rate came to a halt. Insofar as winter is a passive  season in agriculture, the National Bank's position will be firm  and consistent. When the production sphere is activated, the  dollar exhange rate will drop. Some people understand this and  hope to exchange their hard currency at the highest possible  rate. Secondly, the process of privatization has begun.  Enterprises are selling their stock. Those with dollars are  investing their capital in property.    [Levytskyy] Is it true that 29 Russian banks are operating  in  Ukraine at this time, and if so, what impact do they have on our  economy?    [Pylypchuk] There are branches of Russian banks in Ukraine.  Opening branches of foreign banks is a universal practice,  because their funds benefit the country in which they are  located. Under inflationary conditions, however, there is a  danger that the profits from conducting hard currency auctions  do not benefit the Ukrainian economy, that they do not remain in  Ukraine.    [Levytskyy] You frequently meet with economists from abroad.  How well do they understand Ukrainian problems? I am  particularly interesting in how well these are understood in  Poland. According to reports from Warsaw, Poland's foreign  policy towards the east is changing to reflect a greater  emphasis on Russia.    [Pylypchuk] Since I am not only an economist but also a  politician, I do not wish to make any comments about what is  happening in Poland. But I want to stress that it is necessary  to take a sober look at who has come to power in Russia and on  what platforms. Poland was a part of the empire which  Zhirinovsky is planning to restore. The conduct of some  politicians reminds me of the rabbit that places its head into  the mouth of a serpent.    [Levytskyy] What benefits did Ukraine derive from its  membership in the CIS? What is your attitude to the idea put  forward by the national-democratic forces of Ukraine that a  qualitatively new entity should replace the CIS--the  Baltic-Black Sea Community?    [Pylypchuk] I am among those who support the creation of a  Baltic-Black Sea Assembly. Above all, because of the military  doctrine of the Russian Federation, which wants to interfere in  the internal affairs of independent states, in interstate  relations, and to settle conflicts with the help of its armed  forces. The aggressive policies of the USSR have not  disappeared. They have been passed on, along with many other  things, to Russia. Today, this policy is being proclaimed  openly. The countries that lie between the Baltic and Black sea  need to understand that if Russia succeeds in swallowing up  Ukraine, one of them will be next.    [Levytskyy] Especially in light of the fact that as Radio  Liberty has reported, Russian diplomats are now resorting to a  new tactic: "If you do not give us a peacemaking mandate and  credits, Zhirinovskyy will simply take them."    [Pylypchuk] There are forces whom Zhirinovsky wants to  swallow up in Russia itself and in other countries who  understand that such a policy will lead to a conflict that will  shake the world. For that reason, the UN and the developed  countries of the world should listen to the fears being voiced  by the countries that lie between the Baltic and Black seas and  realize that the threat is real. I am confident that they will  adjust their attitude to the new states that have emerged on the  territory of the former USSR and will make the granting of aid  to the Russian Federation conditional on its rejection of  territorial claims on its neighbors.    [Levytskyy] The election campaign has already started in  Ukraine. Judging by the results of two democratic elections in  Poland, a large number of people will cast their votes based on  a party's attractive name or a candidate's effective speech,  rather than on the political platform being proposed. Inasmuch  as these elections are deemed to be especially important, what  should voters focus their attention on?    [Pylypchuk] There is a rule that every people gets the kind  of government and parliament that it deserves. If people do not  want to stand up against it, they deserve this absurd situation.  Sociological surveys indicate that the majority of people has  now come to understand that the parliament and government should  consist of professionals. I am onfident that the electorate will  cast its votes for the reformist forces. As I said earlier, the  democratic bloc has a program for solving the crisis and it has  people who can accomplish this.    [Levytskyy] But you surely agree that far from all voters  will bother to study the program in any depth. They will vote  for reform, but the choice will be between two concepts: "change  everything immediately" or "make changes that have been well  considered and are possible to effect."    [Pylypchuk] There is a grain of reason in both concepts. Our  success will also depend on the speed with which reforms are  conducted. But we should not repeat the mistakes made by our  neighbors.    [Levytskyy] The presidential campaign in the Crimea has  entered a heated phase. The campaign has a distinctly  anti-Ukrainian bent. People are being drawn into the pro-empire  camp with populist slogans about cheap gas and oil. Will Ukraine  be able to maintain her territorial integrity?    [Pylypchuk] Let me answer you first as an economist and then  as a politician. From an economist's standpoint, Crimea's  separation would be to Ukraine's advantage. Per capita income  produced in the Crimea is lower than in Ukraine but higher than  in Russia. Ukraine supplies the Crimea with water and  electricity. This would leave Ukraine with 3.5 billion dollars  of net profit annually. While the Crimea produces only some  three percent of Ukraine's national income, it consumes 18  percent. Hence it requires large subsidies.    But no state in the world gives up territory without a  fight.  I think that all politicians understand what a change of borders  leads to when one of the sides does not agree to this change.  There are already many examples of this on the territory of the  former USSR. I do not believe that politicians will take this  route. When a new boundary is drawn across the land of an owner  without his consent, this land is always drenched with blood.  Those in the Crimea who are pouring gasoline over the ground  must be stopped, because later it will make no difference who  throws the first match--chauvinists or nationalists!    [Levytskyy] Thank you for this conversation, and I hope that  there will be no new boundaries in Ukraine and no blood!    [Pylypchuk] I hope so too. Allow me also to extend my  Christmas greetings to your readers and wish them that troubles  and evil pass them by and that their children bring them joy.</p>

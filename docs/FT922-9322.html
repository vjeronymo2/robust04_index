			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / Sears wary on strength of consumer recovery SEARS, the speciality retailer which embraces Selfridges and a large slice of the UK's shoe shops, was cautious about the strength of the UK consumer recovery as it yesterday reported a 45 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Pounds 81.2m. Mr Geoffrey Maitland Smith, chairman, said consumer confidence had plummeted last year creating the most difficult trading conditions for several decades. And he warned the past three months had 'not brought any substantive upturn in consumer spending'. The company also issued a 'health warning' about levels of future dividends although it held last year's total - uncovered - dividend at 5.355p. 'This was a year in which we could sensibly pay such a dividend. But looking forward one has got to remind shareholders that dividends depend on the profitability and prospects when you come to declare,' Mr Maitland Smith said. In the year to January 31, sales slipped 8 per cent to Pounds 1.98bn but margins were cut by higher costs and discounting by competitors. Profits slipped from Pounds 121.3m to Pounds 96.3m but were further deflated by an exceptional charge of Pounds 15.1m. This resulted from a Pounds 30.1m charge for rationalisation costs which was partly offset by Pounds 17.4m income from property disposals. The company's footwear and men's wear businesses were particularly badly hit. Mr Liam Strong, who took over as chief executive earlier this year, said it would take a further few years to turn around British Shoe Corporation but greater efficiencies could be obtained from segmenting its markets more effectively and buying more aggressively. Borrowings were cut from Pounds 199m to Pounds 153m. Sears' footwear division saw trading profits fall from Pounds 22.2m to Pounds 9.3m. Speciality retailing's contribution slid from Pounds 21.4m to Pounds 16.2m and Selfridges department store chipped in Pounds 16.2m, down from Pounds 19.5m. Profits from Freemans Home Shopping were hit by high investments and fell from Pounds 32m to Pounds 29.9m. The property division yielded Pounds 13.6m in rental income and Pounds 6m from development. Earnings per share slid from 7.6p to 4.2p although the final dividend was maintained at 3.83p. Lex, Page 18</p>

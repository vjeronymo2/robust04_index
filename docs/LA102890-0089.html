			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> SERIOUS INJURIES IN AUTO CRASHES COST MORE THAN FATAL ONES  </P> <P> The 44-year-old scientist was driving home from work in his pickup truck. He  was wearing his seat belt.  </P> <P> A car going in the opposite direction crossed the median, out of control, at  about 50 m.p.h. (73 feet per second) and hit the pickup head-on.  </P> <P> Both drivers survived, but the scientist got the worst of it: severe brain  damage and extensive lower-body injuries that necessitated a year of  rehabilitation and generated $222,000 in medical bills within six months of the  crash.  </P> <P> Recovering from the brain damage was especially difficult, because the injury  worked subtle changes on the man's personality and placed a severe strain on  his family.  </P> <P> After six months at home, he was able to return to work just one day a week,  under the careful supervision of his employers.  </P> <P> Such stories are typical of people injured in high-speed car crashes, according  to researchers at the Shock-Trauma Unit in Baltimore, where a comprehensive  study of highway crash injuries is being sponsored by the federal government.  </P> <P> Though more than 40,000 people are killed on the roads each year, the thousands  of others who are severely injured put a far heavier financial burden on  society.  </P> <P> According to a report prepared for Congress last year, automobile crashes  resulted in direct costs of $12.3 billion in 1985. Total projected lifetime  costs from those injuries was far greater, $48.7 billion.  </P> <P> Severe crashes that do not cause death carry the highest price, according to  other figures cited by the Shock-Trauma researchers: $179,881 in direct  treatment costs, compared to $1,471 in the average fatal crash.  </P> <P> "It's the injury that's driving that insurance bill up," said Dr. John H.  Siegel, chief of the Shock-Trauma study. "You've got to reduce the injuries and  reduce the cost of insurance."  </P> <P> According to one nationwide estimate cited in the report, just 2% of all  non-fatal crashes are likely to account for 44% of lifetime medical costs from  such accidents.  </P> <P> The injured often are young, working people of limited means. Many of the  subjects of the study had no medical insurance: The costs of their treatment  was borne by medical assistance programs.  </P> <P> Even those with good insurance coverage can use up their benefits. All of that  leads Siegel to conclude that medical and insurance savings would far outweigh  the cost of making safer cars.  </P> <P> That fact may do more to alter car design than the annual body count, he said,  adding that big dollar figures have "a tremendous impact in our society -- far  more than death and disability."  </P> <P> New vehicles now must meet federal crash test standards that are based on a  head-on crash into a fixed barrier at 30 m.p.h. In addition, the government  publishes 35-m.p.h. crash data on a limited number of models, strictly for  consumer information.  </P> <P> Seat belts and shoulder belts have long been required in passenger cars. As of  the 1990 model year, all cars must be equipped with passive restraints, such as  air bags or automatic seat belts.  </P> <P> Chrysler, which has driver's-side air bags in all its vehicles made in the  United States starting with the 1990 model year, estimated that the devices  cost the manufacturer $300 per vehicle.  </P> <P> Albert Slechter, a Chrysler Corp. regulatory expert, said the easiest way to  build a more crash-resistant car is to add metal to the vehicle's structure.  </P> <P> But "adding safety adds weight," he said. "When you add weight, you lose fuel  efficiency," and cars also must meet certain federal requirements for fuel  efficiency, Slechter said.  </P> <P> He also noted that even a simple increase in the barrier-crash standard, to 35  m.p.h., "essentially requires a total redesign of the car."  </P> <P> Yet some government-sponsored research has suggested that a safer vehicle could  be marketed with a moderate or nominal increase in price.  </P> <P> MCR Technology Inc., a Santa Barbara-based car safety research and development  firm, worked under contract to the National Highway Traffic Safety  Administration in the 1970s and designed, from scratch, a car capable of  passing a 50-m.p.h. crash test.  </P> <P> "The cost today to do the same thing would be not more than 10%," MCR president  Donald Friedman said. He said that the earlier estimate included start-up costs  for adding air bags and other safety systems that are now fully developed and  on the market.  </P></p>

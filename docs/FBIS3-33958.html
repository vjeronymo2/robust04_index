			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Press review] </F>   [Text] Editorializing on the bilateral talks in  Washington, TISHRIN says: The Washington talks, being  conducted at the level of delegation heads, begin their second  week today amid some positive indications. The paper notes,  however, that decisive results are still a long way off because  the Israeli negotiators have not announced Israel's willingness  to withdraw fully from the occupied Arab territories.  Withdrawal, the paper asserts, is the key to a just and  comprehensive peace in the Middle East.    TISHRIN goes on: Yitzhaq Rabin yesterday acknowledged the  importance of peace with Syria. Rabin had been denying this  fact since the Oslo agreement.    The paper adds: Developments have proven that there can be  no peace in the region without Syria. Syria has over the past  two years made tremendous efforts to advance the peace process.  It presented a working paper during the sixth round, which to  date is the only formal paper for the Washington talks. Syria  has repeatedly rescued the U.S. peace initiative from Israel's  ploys. The Geneva summit was the apex of Syria's serious  endeavor to establish a just, comprehensive, and durable peace  in the Middle East.    TISHRIN underlines U.S. President Clinton's praise for  Syria's relentless efforts and his adoption of President  al-Asad's call for the peace of the brave in the region. Syria  did all of this out of its love for, and belief in, peace, and  not to convince Israel of its true desire for peace. Israel is  the party that should do this.    Concluding its commentary, TISHRIN asserts the need for  Israel's withdrawal from all of the occupied Arab territories,  since this would give the peace process great momentum and  expedite the achievement of tangible, decisive progress on the  path to the just aspired-for peace. Syria is only demanding its  territory and what is its right. Its position is completely in  line with UN resolutions, the Madrid conference foundations, and  the principles of international law. Israeli occupation, on the  other hand, violates resolutions and principles. The aggressor  should certainly prove its goodwill.    Under the headline "The Touchstone," AL-THAWRAH says:  Despite the optimistic atmosphere that prevailed the world  following the Geneva summit and one week after the Washington  talks at the level of the heads of delegations, Israel alone has  continued to adhere to its methods that obstruct any concrete  progress. Israel alone is the source of pessimism about  prospects for making concrete progress, by avoiding giving any  clear and definite answers to the question of full withdrawal  from the Golan and the occupied Arab territories, which is the  basis of a just and comprehensive peace.    AL-THAWRAH affirms that maneuvering has continued to be the  distinguishing feature of Israel's policy. This is despite the  fact that the Geneva summit has convinced the whole world,  primarily the United States, of the true Arab desire for a just  and comprehensive peace, and despite everything that Syria has  done throughout the peace process, including the important  Geneva summit, to prove its goodwill and tireless efforts to  achieve a just and comprehensive peace that restores to the  Arabs their land and rights and preserves their dignity.    AL-THAWRAH adds: No doubt, Israel was the biggest -- not to  say the only -- loser after the Geneva summit. Israel did not  want the Geneva summit to convene in the first place. It wanted  the Zionist voice to be the only voice in the ears of the U.S.  Administration.    The paper goes on: The Geneva summit has accentuated the  need for a just and comprehensive solution in accordance with  the resolutions of international legitimacy. It has also  bolstered Syria's key role in the region, especially in the  peace process on all of its tracks.    The paper concludes: Amid this climate, the Washington talks  are continuing. These talks put the Tel Aviv rulers to the  test, as to whether or not they are going to respond to the will  of the international community and that of Washington in  implementing Security Council resolutions and acknowledging the  requirements for a just and comprehensive solution. Based on  this touchstone, the international community will be responsible  for implementing its legitimacy and putting an end to Israel's  rebellion.    Under the headline "The Margin for Israeli Maneuvering,"  AL-THAWRAH writes in another commentary: The results of the  historic Geneva summit between Presidents al-Asad and Clinton  have placed Israel in a tight spot and face to face with the  challenge of peace. Israel has only one option: Either to  accept a just, comprehensive peace and respond to its  requirements and conditions -- enshrined in the resolutions of  international legitimacy and stipulating withdrawal from all of  the occupied Arab territories and acknowledging the inalienable  rights of the Palestinian people -- or to reject this peace and  bear the consequences for passing up this historic opportunity.    AL-THAWRAH asserts that the world is now convinced that  Israel is the party that is creating obstacles to hinder and  blow up the peace process and deny this hot, unstable region any  peace and stability. This is because Israel's creed and strategy  and the reasons for its existence contradict this situation.    The paper concludes: All indications, and the conduct of the  Tel Aviv rulers, point to one fact: The Israeli rulers are not  in the business of making peace. They are absolutely not  interested in making the peace process succeed. Quite the  opposite is true.</p>

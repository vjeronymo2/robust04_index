			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / Trying to bridge a narrow but deep gap: As the stakes in the rail dispute rise, Robert Taylor sees signs of hope in both camps The public exchange of views yesterday between Mr Robert Horton, Railtrack chairman, and Mr Jimmy Knapp, general secretary of the RMT transport union, looks like bringing about an early resumption of negotiations to resolve the signalling dispute that has dragged on for seven weeks. But whether it will lead to a settlement of an industrial conflict that could worsen early next month and inflict serious damage on the economy is another matter. For some time both sides have seemed extremely close to an agreement, but two sets of marathon negotiations at the conciliation service Acas have failed to achieve a breakthrough. It is not surprising that Dr Brian Mawhinney, the new transport secretary, has found it hard to understand why the resolution of the dispute has proved elusive. On the face of it the gap between Railtrack and the RMT remains narrow, but it has also turned out to be surprisingly deep. Yesterday's statements by the two main protagonists provided further tantalising evidence of this apparent deadlock while at the same time hinting at possible ways out. Mr Knapp reiterated that the dispute concerned 'a long-standing claim' that signalling workers be 'compensated for past and continuing productivity at a time when their pay has fallen behind other railway grades'. He continued to insist that the RMT was offered 5.7 per cent on June 8 in recognition of this and in return for a commitment to further negotiations on productivity measures through restructuring. Mr Knapp said: 'This was by no means a no-strings deal.' It involved the RMT's acceptance of a range of new working practices for signalling grades. 'It is difficult to see how it could be construed as breaking government pay guidelines,' he added. The RMT insists that since Mr John MacGregor, the previous transport secretary, vetoed the 5.7 per cent offer on June 9, Railtrack has failed to address the RMT claim for rewards for past efficiency savings. The union says that once the RMT claim is resolved, talks can start 'quickly' on an overall restructuring package. Mr Knapp said: 'At the last Acas talks both sides were close to an understanding that restructuring should be negotiated through a joint working party and I see that as a sensible way forward.' The Railtrack chairman has taken some cautious hope from Mr Knapp's carefully written statement. Mr Horton wrote back to the RMT leader that 'some progress' had been made at the abortive Acas talks on July 11 and 12 'by making it clear any settlement would have an element of early reward and that would be a sound basis upon which a final restructuring package could be secured'. The company still believes its offer of a 2.5 per cent general increase plus a 6 per cent unconsolidated increase in basic rates is worth 3.4 per cent on earnings, and a Pounds 250 lump sum for every signal worker provides 'the opportunity to break out of the present impasse'. Railtrack also insists its offer on the table is open to further negotiation. Yesterday's signs of hope may well flicker out. But the stakes are rising. On August 4 the RMT will announce the result of its strike ballot of 500 supervisors, who are being asked to join the signalling grades in the industrial conflict. If this produces a Yes vote they could join the action by August 11-12 and could paralyse the network on strike days. It is a prospect that provides an impetus for more negotiations.</p>

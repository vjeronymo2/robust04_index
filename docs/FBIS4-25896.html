			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Wang Zhongyu, minister of the State Economic and </F> Trade Commission: "State-Owned Enterprises Prosper"]    [Text] This year, sound development in production and  reform has been registered by China's state-owned enterprises  which are undergoing changes in their operational mechanisms and  the reform for instituting a modern enterprise system.    From January to April this year, the total output value of  state industrial enterprises increased by 4.7 percent over last  year's same period. In April, the figure rose by 5 percent. No  large-scale suspensions or partial halts in production were  recorded for state enterprises during the period. A recent  investigation carried out in 16 provinces and municipalities  showed that the number of enterprises suspending production or  operating below capacity accounted for only 10 percent of the  total number of state-owned enterprises, with 4 percent actually  having suspended production. An investigation in Beijing  indicated that the proportion was even less, accounting for only  2 percent of the total number of state firms in the  municipality. In the country as a whole, enterprises required  to suspend production or operate below capacity were mostly  small and medium-sized enterprises in coal and textiles  industries.    A number of factors have contributed to the adverse  situation, including the excessive production capacity and  unsalable products turned out by certain industries. In other  cases, the operation of some enterprises has been handled  improperly. Still others have been forced to close, suspend  production, merge with other enterprises, or switch to the  manufacture of other products in accordance with state  industrial policies, or due to readjustment in each individual  enterprise's organizational structure, or urban transformations  projects.    Some reports about the increasing losses of state-owned  enterprises are false and misleading. Since last July, to  facilitate the establishment of a socialist market economic  structure, state-owned enterprises have implemented the General  Rules on the Finance of Enterprises and the Norms of Enterprise  Accounting which dovetail the international accounting system.  They have included some expenses formally paid by enterprise  profits, such as interest on long-term loans and salary and  bonus increases, into their production cost. Simultaneously, in  order to accelerate technical transformation, such enterprises  have been allowed to raise their rate of depreciation on  equipment. All of the measures have helped enterprises expand  their decision-making power and are beneficial to their  long-term development. Although the actual book profits of  enterprise have come down, with the result that the narrow  profit margins of some enterprises have turned into losses and  the latent losses of some other enterprises have been switched  into explicit losses, the actual returns of enterprises have  increased.    According to statistics released by the Ministry of Finance,  between January and March this year, the cost outlays of  enterprises increased 11 billion yuan due to disbursements  recorded as costs, including items such as interest on loans for  fixed assets, depreciation, bonuses, and welfare and educational  fees. Counting 8.1 billion yuan of actual profits kept in  account books, the amount of profits increased by 50 percent  over last year's same period.    The government plans to adopt measures to solve the problem  of losses incurred by some enterprises. For those with poor  management, a modern enterprise system will be instituted, with  due emphasis placed on turning losses into profits by deepening  the reform and changing operational mechanisms. At present,  relevant departments under the State Council and governments at  all levels are adopting measures to carry out the work.    In an effort to alleviate the difficulties facing some  state-owned enterprises and inspire them to change their  operational mechanisms, the State Council has readjusted its  credit policy toward industrial enterprises' circulating funds.  The bank will provide loans to enterprises whose products enjoy  a ready market even if they are currently suffering from losses  or are in debt or are in arrears with payment of bank interest.  However, it is prohibited from granting loans to enterprises  with an excessive stock of unsalable products. With regard to  the basic living expenses of employees in loss-making  enterprises, the bank will provide loans, and local governments  will also offer discounted interest on loans in order to ensure  social stability. Enterprises which have no possibility for  turning losses into profits will carry out procedures outlined  in the Bankruptcy Law. Experiments will be carried out prior to  nationwide implementation of the measures.    At present, some state enterprises are plagued by a shortage  of circulating funds due to their excessive investment scale and  extensive participation in construction projects. In addition,  some enterprises seek increased output by engaging in blind  production, and as a result the sales volume for their products  has plummeted, loans cannot be repaid on schedule, and serious  mutual delinquencies have occurred. To solve these problems,  the government will strictly control excessive investments in  fixed assets and bulging consumption funds. Meanwhile, the  principle of "limiting the production of overstocked  commodities, reducing inventories and facilitating marketing"  will be implemented. The State Council has authorized relevant  department to join forces with the bank and other departments to  terminate mutual arrears between enterprises. The fund shortage  is expected to be gradually eliminated through the concerted  efforts of governments at all levels and enterprises themselves.</p>

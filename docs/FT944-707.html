			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / SFO chief defends its actions over Guinness: Cover-up allegations denied Mr George Staple, the director of the Serious Fraud Office, yesterday defended the actions of the SFO in the Guinness trial and said it would fight the appeal involving the four original defendants. He strongly refuted allegations of a cover-up made earlier yesterday by Lord Spens, another Guinness defendant. He told the Financial Times: 'What Lord Spens is saying is pretty extravagant stuff frankly. It's not true. We are not here to deny people's human rights. We are here to ensure, so far as we can, that people have a fair trial.' He added: 'Of course we are here to secure convictions where we believe somebody has committed fraud . . . but we are not here to win at all costs. We are here to ensure that the court receives the fullest information so that ultimately the jury can decide.' The appeal relates to a claim that the SFO withheld material evidence from the four defendants in the first Guinness trial. Mr Staple was not in charge at the SFO when the case was put together but he yesterday assumed full responsibility on behalf of his organisation. He said the office had taken the view at the time of the first Guinness trial that material showing that share support operations, of the kind practised in the Guinness case, were common practice in the the 1980s was not relevant. 'Only when Lord Spens' trial began, did it become apparent that the material was relevant to his defence and it was produced.' He added: 'It was produced entirely voluntarily. There was no suppression in any sense.' A successful appeal could open up claims for an unprecedented amount of compensation. Based on the fines given to the defendants, and additional claims for personal and associated business losses, some estimates yesterday were putting these at between Pounds 30m and Pounds 40m. Mr Staple said: 'It sounds to me a huge amount of money to compensate anybody for but I can't say whether it is right, near right, or wildly exaggerated.' He also defended the SFO's conviction rate - he put it at 80 per cent of cases against the Labour party's estimate of 40 per cent. A draft report on the future of the SFO is soon to go before government. Mr Staple seemed to anticipate an overhaul in the way fraud cases would be dealt with in the future. He said some cases that the SFO prosecuted through the criminal courts could in future be dealt with by tribunals. He refused to accept however that Guinness had sounded the death knell for the SFO after other setbacks such as the Blue Arrow case.</p>

			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / Finance and the Family: Protect yourself against those thieves who get too personal - Home computers and mobile telephones are being used widely - but losses are soaring, too. And getting insurance can be tricky PERSONAL computers and mobile telephones are finding their way into the homes and cars of more and more people. Unfortunately, they are delicate, easily-damaged pieces of equipment - and extremely attractive to thieves. How you insure a domestic personal computer will depend on what you use it for. If it is purely for personal and family operations - playing games, writing letters or doing the household accounts - it should be easy to insure under your home contents policy, in the same way as any other electrical item. An expensive machine, however, might have to be named on the policy, which could cost more. One point to watch for is that not all home contents policies include accidental damage. This can be particularly important with computer equipment, as even a spilt cup of coffee can cause havoc with the system. If you ever use the computer for business, whether your own or your employer's, cover under your home contents insurance could be invalidated. Should you have any doubt about what constitutes business use, consult your insurance company; some are more flexible than others. Very few home contents policies specifically include equipment used for business. One which does is Sun Alliance and Chubb's Masterpiece, an up-market home and contents policy. This covers automatically any business furnishings and equipment in the home, as well as the more usual home contents, and will also pay to replace personal data on a home computer. The snag is that it is available only to people living in houses with other expensive valuables. Other insurance companies will want to check the exact set-up before agreeing to cover home computers used for any degree of business. If they think the computer falls more under business than personal use, they may offer to add business cover to your household policy - at a price. Anyone who runs a business from home could also find it prudent to seek protection against loss of computer data after an accident, or loss of income due to business interruption. This is the type of specialist cover provided by commercial policies. Mainstream office policies are not designed for people working from home; the minimum premiums and security requirements can make them impractical for one-person small businesses. But two companies now offer insurance specially designed for such circumstances: London &amp; Edinburgh, and Tolson Messenger. L &amp; E's Home-Work policy covers home and business contents together. Optional cover is available for buildings, accidental damage, all-risks, business interruption, liability, goods in transit and so on, depending on each client's circumstances. The premiums will depend on what is covered, your postcode, and the kind of business in which you are involved. Accountants working from home will pay less than picture restorers, for example. Tolson Messenger's Home Office policy is confined to business rather than personal contents. It also covers business interruption, loss of money, personal assault, and liabilities. There is an automatic Pounds 1,500 of all-risks cover for items such as portable computers removed temporarily from your office. For Pounds 7,500 of contents cover, the standard premium is Pounds 120, rising to Pounds 265 for the maximum Pounds 20,000. There are some security conditions, such as adequate locks. Portable computers can present added difficulties, as they need to be insured for use outside the home and are seen as more vulnerable to theft and damage. They can usually be covered under home contents personal possessions, or all-risks extensions; but if you take a portable computer home from work regularly, make sure it is covered by your employer's insurance. National Vulcan has a very comprehensive computer policy, which includes portables, but it is designed for business users. High levels of cover and minimum premiums mean it is worthwhile only if you have extremely expensive equipment which you use a lot or take abroad. Thefts of mobile 'phones are soaring. Organised thieves steal them to order, reprogramme them and sell them on, sometimes within minutes of the theft, while more amateurish thieves may rack up large airtime bills on your telephone if there is a gap between its being stolen and your reporting the theft. If you have your own rather than a company one, you might be offered insurance by your supplier, but this will add considerably to the cost as premiums have been pushed up by high damage and theft claims. For this reason, not all mobile 'phone companies offer insurance. Aztec is one that does and there is a variety of packages. Subscribers can choose from mechanical breakdown cover for Pounds 3.95 a month; theft and accidental damage for Pounds 4.95; the two combined for Pounds 7.95; or a package that also includes air-time misuse (unauthorised calls made after a 'phone is stolen) for Pounds 8.95. Again, mobiles can be covered under personal possessions or all-risks sections of your home contents or office insurance, but these options are unlikely to reimburse you for air-time misuse, and will not cover mechanical breakdown and related expenses.</p>

			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Moscow signals retreat on credits MR Yegor Gaidar, the Russian prime minister, yesterday appeared to signal a further retreat by the government in the face of industrial pressure for credits to alleviate its vast debt problem. Mr Gaidar, whose new title has not yet been confirmed by the parliament, was quoted by Reuters news agency as saying that Rbs500bn would be granted over six months to help enterprises cope with a Rbs2trillion debt. This would appear to increase by Rbs300bn the Rbs200bn aid promised just before the Congress of People's Deputies in April, but not yet disbursed. There are no details on the interest rates at which the credits would be offered, nor to whom. Mr Gaidar was quoted as saying that 'there is reason to believe that they (the credits) will not provoke hyperinflation or seriously worsen the financial situation'. However, the move fitted the recent drift of the government away from radical reform to a much closer accommodation with the industrial lobby, on which it now relies for its support. The industrial lobby, in turn, is naming as its price more credits and controlled energy prices. The move also comes as the International Monetary Fund team completes talks with government ministers and officials, with no sign of an accord on the government programme which would release the funds of Dollars 24bn. Figures released showed that Russian industrial output was down 13.2 per cent in the first five months of 1992.</p>

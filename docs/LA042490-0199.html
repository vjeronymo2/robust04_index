			<p><P> April 24, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> PLEA NAMING MACLAINE REFUSED  </P> <P> The Supreme Court refused to give new life to a copyright lawsuit over actress  Shirley MacLaine's 1983 best-selling book, "Out on a Limb."  </P> <P> The court, without comment Monday, let stand rulings that MacLaine's book about  reincarnation and other spiritual subjects did not infringe the copyright of a  1977 book written by Charles Silva. Silva's suit sought monetary damages from  MacLaine and the American Broadcasting Companies Inc., which in 1987 made a  television movie based on the book. Silva, from Peru, authored "Date With the  Gods" in 1977 and sent a copy to MacLaine. She later discussed it with him and  eventually traveled with him to areas of Peru described in his book.  </P></p>

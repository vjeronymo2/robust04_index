			<p><P> November 23, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> IRVINE CO. ASKS FOR A DELAY IN PROJECT HEARING  </P> <P> The Irvine Co. on Wednesday requested that the county Planning Commission delay  for 30 days next week's scheduled hearing on the developer's controversial  Laguna Laurel project that would bring more than 3,000 homes into pristine  Laguna Canyon.  </P> <P> "The company wants to continue its discussions with officials from the city of  Laguna Beach," said Dawn McCormick, director of corporate communications for  the Irvine Co. The company "felt it would be more appropriate to continue those  (negotiations) in a climate that didn't include a public forum."  </P> <P> The decision to request a delay was made by Don Hunt, senior vice president of  the Irvine Co., who has participated in meetings with Laguna Beach officials,  McCormick said.  </P> <P> McCormick would not speculate about whether the Irvine Co. had requested the  delay because it was close to reaching an agreement with the city concerning  the project, which would bring suburbia to one of the last undeveloped coastal  canyons in Southern California.  </P> <P> "As part of our discussions with them, we've kept the different proposals and  counterproposals silent," she said. "Therefore, as part of this, we will be  also doing that."  </P> <P> The company's request for a hearing postponement was applauded by both  environmentalists and city officials.  </P> <P> "We're pleased with the sincerity (of company officials) to negotiate," said  Harry Huggins, a leading opponent of the Irvine project. "We're pleased with  their development of new-found wisdom in the value in keeping Laguna Canyon  free of any development. . . . We plan to make good use of this 30-day break to  further inform countywide residents of the environmental issues at stake."  </P> <P> Laguna Beach City Councilwoman Lida Lenney called the delay a "significant  development in the course of negotiations."  </P> <P> "I'm thrilled," Lenney said. "It sounds as though the Irvine Co. is serious  about helping us find a way to preserve the canyon."  </P> <P> The requested postponement follows a protest on Nov. 12 in which an estimated  7,000 to 8,000 people marched up Laguna Canyon Road to denounce the project,  which is just outside the Laguna Beach city limits near a greenbelt that  separates the community from the rest of Orange County. The Irvine Co. also  wants to turn rural Laguna Canyon Road into a six-lane highway and build major  thoroughfares throughout the project.  </P> <P> Irvine Co. officials maintain that the 2,150-acre project, which includes  homes, apartments and condominiums, includes a generous amount of open space  and will improve a dangerous stretch of highway.  </P></p>

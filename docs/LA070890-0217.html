			<p><P> July 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD CUP BROADCASTS USE LONG-DISTANCE CALL;  </P> <P> TELEVISION: SPANISH NETWORK ANNOUNCERS WATCH SOCCER TOURNAMENT IN LAGUNA NIGUEL  STUDIO, BUT THE ACTION'S IN ITALY. ARRANGEMENT HASN'T HURT RATINGS.  </P> <P> An hour into a World Cup soccer match in Italy this week, West German defender  Andreas Brehme launched a kick that bounced off an English player's backside,  ricocheted high into the air and flew over sprawled English goaltender Peter  Shilton into the net.  </P> <P> "Goooooollllllllllllllll! Gooooooollllllllllllll!" shouted Andres Cantor,  play-by-play man for the Spanish-language Univision television network,  momentarily transporting millions of viewers in the United States to Turin's  delirious Stadio Delle Alpi. "Golllll, Alemania!"  </P> <P> But Cantor was about as close to Italy as a pizza from Domino's. Before each  game during the monthlong futbol frenzy, he and color commentator Norberto  Longo don blue blazers with network logos, splash on a little makeup in the  men's room and hunker down in Univision's studio in suburban Laguna Niguel.  They call the games from 6,300 miles away, over a steady background din of  stadium crowd noise, while watching on a TV monitor six feet in front of their  noses.  </P> <P> "We don't tell people we're in Italy," said Univision senior producer Art  Izquierdo. "We're not trying to fool anybody."  </P> <P> Maybe not, but you don't hear Cantor or Longo beginning their World Cup  broadcasts, which reach 512 stations across the country -- including Los  Angeles' KMEX Channel 34 -- with a greeting from the well-known soccer hotbed  of Orange County, either.  </P> <P> Instead, they simply tell their viewers that the games are coming to them  "live," which they are, courtesy of Italian TV and a satellite relay through  Mexico City.  </P> <P> Actually, sending Cantor and Longo to Italy for the World Cup tournament would  have made little sense for Univision. The tournament is structured so that  games are played in several cities within the host country, sometimes on the  same day, and Cantor and Longo are Univision's sole broadcast team. From Laguna  Niguel, they can announce two games in one day from cities on opposite ends of  the country, and cut to Univision's four reporters and crews in Italy to  provide live interviews with coaches and players.  </P> <P> And the pair's distance from the games hasn't hurt Univision's ratings. KMEX  has seen its audience jump by 25% to 50% during the World Cup matches, and the  station is outdrawing the English-language soccer broadcasts on the TNT cable  channel 5 to 1. The competition concludes with today's championship match  between West Germany and Argentina.  </P> <P> There are drawbacks to announcing from a studio, however. "You get limited  vision, and only see what everyone else sees too," said Cantor. "I try to  anticipate the plays, and if I'm wrong, I correct myself immediately."  </P> <P> He's not wrong too often. Rarely glancing at the lineup sheets he has scribbled  in front of him, Cantor immediately identifies the small images on the screen  and calls the action almost before it occurs.  </P> <P> "I do this every week of the year," explained Cantor, who announces Univision's  weekly international soccer broadcasts from the Laguna Niguel studio. "At this  stage, I've seen the players time in and time out."  </P> <P> Cantor, 27, grew up in Buenos Aires but moved to Pasadena with his parents as a  teen-ager. He played soccer and graduated from San Marino High School, then  studied journalism at USC. He has been doing the weekly Univision broadcasts  for about three years; this is his first World Cup.  </P> <P> Cantor's distinctive gol! cry isn't really much different from those of other  Spanish-language soccer announcers, all of whom draw the three-letter word out  for several seconds, at least.  </P> <P> "A goal is the climax of the action, and there may be only one of them a game,"  said Cantor. "All the Latin announcers call the goals the same way."  </P> <P> Longo, 46, is also Argentine. He is Univision's regular boxing announcer, but  he has broadcast seven World Cup soccer tournaments on radio or television, and  brings to the game an outspoken style that sometimes makes his producers  cringe.  </P> <P> When a French referee began showboating in a pivotal Italy-Argentina match,  Longo railed against him. "This referee is fatal," he said. "He wants to be the  protagonist, he wants to make a show. . . . He is so on top of the action that  he's making a nuisance of himself."  </P> <P> With his rich baritone voice and penchant for sports psychology, Longo has no  problem imbuing the contests with his own sense of drama from the darkened  Univision studio. The closing minutes of each game are "the moment of truth."  Well-struck shots are "impresionante" or "violentisima." Last Wednesday, he  described the England-West Germany epic like this:  </P> <P> "England is trying to replace technique with energy and desire. . . . Here is  the difference in this game: the superior skill of Germany and the vigor of  England . . . an old clash between two things almost as traditional as soccer  itself."  </P> <P> Both announcers say that calling the games from the studio is more exhausting  than working from a booth at the stadium. "We have to concentrate so that it's  as if we're in the stadium," says Longo. "It's a great effort to transmit the  emotion of the game."  </P> <P> After the England-Germany overtime encounter, which ended at 2 p.m. here, but  11 p.m. in Italy, Cantor said he felt ready to go to sleep. "For me, it's  midnight already," he said. "When I see it's dark in the stadium, I feel like  it's nighttime here as well."  </P> <P> Today, the pair will announce their last game -- the Cup final between powerful  West Germany and defending champion Argentina. With thousands of Argentines in  the United States tuned in and praying for an upset, will Cantor's heritage  make it a difficult game for him to call?  </P> <P> "No, of course not," he said. "I'm a professional, I call all the games the  same. But I would be a hypocrite if I told you my heart wasn't with Argentina."  </P></p>

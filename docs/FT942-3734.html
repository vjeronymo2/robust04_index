			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / Move to impeach Iliescu Romania's main opposition party yesterday started unprecedented moves to impeach President Ion Iliescu for violating the country's constitution. The National Peasants Party said it had begun to collect signatures needed for a motion in parliament to impeach the president on the grounds that he tried to pervert the course of justice and to undermine the independence of the judiciary. The party is basing its case on statements Mr Iliescu made last month in which he urged local courts not to return property nationalised under the Communist regime to former owners. Parliament, which is dominated by Mr Iliescu's supporters, is not expected to approve the motion, the first of its kind in post-Communist Romania. The move coincides with anti-government demonstrations planned today by leading trade unions calling for higher pay and faster reform.</p>

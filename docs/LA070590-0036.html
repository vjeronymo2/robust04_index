			<p><P> July 5, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FLAWED MIRROR HAMPERS HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE  </P> <P> Discovery of an apparent flaw in the Hubble Telescope has been accompanied by a  flurry of statements and speculations relating to the management and technical  execution of the program. Since the Hughes name has been associated with the  technical difficulties, I feel it is important to clarify the Hughes  relationship.  </P> <P> The Hubble mirrors were manufactured almost 10 years ago by a division of the  Perkin-Elmer Corp. This organization was acquired late last year by the Hughes  Aircraft Co. and renamed Hughes Danbury Optical Systems. Hughes is fully  supporting the technical teams both at NASA and at Danbury in analyzing and  correcting the problem as soon as possible. The full range of Hughes  technologies are being made available for this effort.  </P> <P> I am obviously concerned about the Hughes name and our technology -- neither of  which are in question here.  </P> <P> MALCOLM R. CURRIE, Chairman  </P> <P> Hughes, Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / Management: Passing the hat round - The Cadbury committee wants to see new faces among the non-executive directors of British companies Sir Adrian Cadbury, the courtly chairman of a panel studying corporate governance in the UK, caused a storm when he casually suggested that the days of multiple non-executive directorships were coming to an end. Howls of protest emerged and Sir Adrian quickly explained that what he meant to say was that while holding several non-executive directorships could be a good thing, holding too many might make it difficult to do the job properly. His remarks underscored a fact of life that those seeking to improve the performance of corporate boards have known for some time: the pool from which non-executives are selected is too small. Indeed, the expanded demand for non-executives means that a small number of individuals are being forced to wear too many hats. Increasingly, a handful of corporate insiders are called upon to do a job which really calls for an outsider. 'If you confine the pool to those who are on the boards of other corporate plcs, they will have the same mind-set as those who are there already,' Sir Adrian said. The Committee on the Financial Aspects of Corporate Governance, chaired by Sir Adrian, has urged a much greater role for non-executives. The problem is not that suitable candidates do not exist, but that companies have too narrow a notion of the kind of person who would fit the role. Pro-Ned, the Bank of England-backed organisation that promotes non-executives, has a list of about 750 individuals who it says have all the characteristics to be good non-execs but who are rarely asked. Bruce Rhodes of Pro-Ned says that roughly 100 approaches are made each year to Pro-Ned from companies looking for a qualified non-executive but that only a handful are actually selected from its list. The list is compiled from those who have sent in their CVs to Pro-Ned. For every five applicants, Pro-Ned is only able to add one individual to its list. Rhodes said that the organisation sees little point in maintaining individuals on its list who are unlikely to fit the requirements of any company. 'It is natural for members of a team to look for others who will fit in easily,' Sir Adrian said, delicately explaining why companies were so reluctant to broaden their horizons. Most boards, according to Pro-Ned, are unwilling to accept anyone who has never previously served on a UK corporate board. Thus, an incestuous group of directors move from one company to another wearing, at various times, executive and non-executive hats. Rhodes notes that such practices mean that women are under-represented on boards. Meanwhile, Pro-Ned says that the way in which vacant non-executive posts are filled usually ensures that the pool will remain narrow. Typically, a board chairman will ask other board members for recommendations. Fewer than 20 per cent of all non-executive directorships are filled with the aid of an independent search party and, frequently, the outside adviser is none other than the company's investment bank. Of Pro-Ned's list, roughly 5 per cent are academics and another 5 per cent are from the public or voluntary sector. Among its small number of successful placements of academics was that last year of Nancy Lane, a microbiologist at Oxford University who is now a non-executive director at medical supply company Smith &amp; Nephew. Rhodes points out that an individual who has had experience running, say, a large university, voluntary aid organisation or NHS hospital may have, in practice, been running a company larger than many UK plcs. Also on the list are divisional heads of some of Britain's largest companies such as British Petroleum and ICI that have a policy of encouraging such individuals to take on non-executive directorships. But many on the list, with apparently suitable qualifications, are never even approached. Chris Higgins, chairman of Bradford University Research - the university's commercial research arm - has been on Pro-Ned's list for five years and has never been interviewed. A Cambridge University physics graduate and an expert in electronic systems, he was a non-executive director of food retailer Amos Hinton before it was acquired by Argyll. He had also been the director of Bradford University Business School. Higgins said his name was put forward several times by Pro-Ned to companies seeking a non-executive but he has never been interviewed. 'When I was accepted on the list, Pro-Ned gave me a list of five categories that companies hate most. Military men, academics, management consultants, bankers and retired people.' With his CV falling squarely into two of those categories, Higgins figures his chances are slim.</p>

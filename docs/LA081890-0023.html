			<p><P> August 18, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OIL ISSUES  </P> <P> Sen. Richard H. Bryan's call for drastic increases in motor vehicle fuel  economy as a way to assure that the U.S. won't be "hostage to the vagaries of  Middle-East politics" ("Fuel Economy: A Shield Against New Oil Shocks,"  Commentary, Aug. 6) sidesteps too many facts to go unanswered.  </P> <P> The current Middle East situation is being used by some to stampede Congress  into taking precipitous action that would result in limited energy security  benefits and that could be harmful to American consumers and our economy.  </P> <P> The fact is, Bryan's bill, calling for a 40% fuel-economy increase in  manufacturers' fleets of new cars and light trucks, would do little to reduce  our dependence on foreign oil.  </P> <P> I point to the fact that today, after motor vehicle manufacturers improved fuel  efficiency over 100%, U.S. oil imports are higher than in 1973.  </P> <P> The present crisis in the Middle East underscores the urgency for a  comprehensive, broad-based energy security program. It does not call for  singular action that would have limited benefits, but serious repercussions for  all Americans.  </P> <P> THOMAS H. HANNA  </P> <P> President, Motor Vehicle  </P> <P> Manufacturers Assn.  </P> <P> Detroit, Mich.  </P></p>

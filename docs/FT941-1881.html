			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / International Company News: Olivetti in European multi-media venture Olivetti, the Italian computers group, said yesterday it had set up a joint venture with Redgate Communications of the US to exploit Europe's growing market in multi-media services, which is expected to be worth Dollars 10bn in 1996. Outside Italy, the venture marks Olivetti's entry into the European market for electronic catalogues. Olivetti is to hold a 51 per cent stake and Redgate, a specialist multi-media editor based in Vero Beach, Florida, will have 49 per cent. Redgate is a venture capital based company whose investors include AT&amp;T Ventures and Olivetti. The first project planned for the joint venture is InStoreNet in France. The service will give customers access on specialist retailing networks to catalogues offering graphical, audio and video information on hardware and software products. Olivetti's participation, which will be managed by its recently formed telecommunications and multi-media division, reinforces the company's shift away from hardware to more profitable service-based activities.</p>

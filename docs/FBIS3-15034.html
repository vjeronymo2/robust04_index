The principal tendency remains the same -- political leaders  are gradually losing popularity. Aloyzas Sakalas, leader of the  Social Democratic Party, was the only exception during the  period between mid-January and mid-February.    The results of the poll conducted by the British-Lithuanian  Baltic Surveys company suggest the following list of top ten  Lithuanian politicians:    Algirdas Brazauskas -- 56 percent /-2/    Egidijus Bickauskas -- 50 percent /-3/    Romualdas Ozolas -- 46 percent /-1/    Kazimieras Antanavicius -- 41 percent /0/    Vytautas Landsbergis -- 35 percent /-5/    Adolfas Slezevicius -- 33 percent /-4/    Gediminas Vagnorius -- 28 percent /0/    Aloyzas Sakalas -- 28 percent /+1/    Ceslovas Jursenas -- 27 percent /-1/    Povilas Gylys -- 18 percent /0/</p>

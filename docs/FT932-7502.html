			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Clinton has reservations on UN safe havens in Bosnia PRESIDENT Bill Clinton expressed deep reservations yesterday about the latest Russian proposals to establish 'safe havens' in Bosnia protected by a multinational peacekeeping force including US troops. Speaking after a White House meeting with Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, the president said the US was 'sceptical that we'll be able to resolve this satisfactorily within the framework that has been proposed. 'I don't want to see the US get in a position where we're re-creating Northern Ireland, Lebanon or Cyprus or anything else,' he said. He conceded 'some potential down the road' for a peacekeeping operation, but added: 'We don't want our people in there basically in a shooting gallery.' Mr Clinton's remarks appear to cast doubt on next week's planned UN Security Council deliberations on Bosnia, likely to discuss three new motions: the establishment of safe havens, the setting up of a war crimes tribunal and the stationing of monitors on the Bosnia-Serbia border. The rump Yugoslavia yesterday refused to accept the deployment of about 500 inspectors to enforce a blockade on its borders with Bosnia. The rejection was sure to complicate even further efforts to forge a common strategy. Mr Clinton's negative comments stood in sharp contrast to those of Mr Kozyrev, who insisted after the White House session and two rounds of talks on Thursday with Mr Warren Christopher, secretary of state, that the US and Russia were 'very, very close' to an agreement that could be presented to western European countries. Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, arrived in Washington for talks with Mr Christopher yesterday. He was expected to take exception to Mr Clinton's comparisons of Bosnia with Northern Ireland. Mr Alain Juppe, the French foreign minister, is due here for consultations this weekend. Mr Clinton was not entirely dismissive of the prospects of an international agreement. Stressing that the US goals were to contain the fighting and stop the killing, he said that 'ultimately there will have to be some reasonable borders and some political solutions which have a reasonable territorial component'. In such circumstances, he implied, US ground forces could be deployed in a peacekeeping capacity. The White House had said on Thursday that its main problem with 'safe havens' was that they appeared to reward the territorial gains achieved by the Serbian policies of 'ethnic cleansing,' also practised by Croatia against Moslems in Bosnia. However, the New York Times yesterday quoted senior officials as saying that Mr Christopher had come round to the view that it was impossible to roll back all Serb gains and was prepared to accept the safe haven notion if it was 'a temporary measure and not the endorsement of any concept of partition'.

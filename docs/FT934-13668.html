			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Survey of Derivatives (18): Cutting costs of hamburgers - Profile: MCDonald's THE world of derivatives, McDonald's Corporation is a typical user. It is a large company, which, because a lot of its earnings and borrowings emanate from overseas, faces currency and interest rate risks in many markets. What makes McDonald's particularly interesting, however, is that there can be few companies where the benefits of derivatives are so clearly apparent - not just to the chief financial officer and corporate treasurer, but to the thousands of people across the world who run restaurants under the famous yellow arch. They, as much as anyone, have been able to enjoy the rewards of derivatives. Mr Carleton D Pearl, McDonald's treasurer, explains how its franchisees are able to use derivative instruments to cut the cost of their borrowings. 'There are programmes run by our banks that finance the franchisee, which include a cap in the cost of the loan. What is interesting about that is, if you're a small- or medium-sized business owner, and you're trying to put a cap on a prime rate loan in the US, you would have to figure out how many options you would need to buy on an exchange. Now, how could they possibly deal with that? What the banker can do, is make a loan at 150 basis points over commercial paper, or a loan at 175 over commercial paper, and promise you that you'll never have to pay more than 10 per cent.' In other words, says Mr Pearl, 'derivatives can deliver value to small- and medium-sized businesses by enabling them to manage risks that they're not equipped to manage. Most people think derivatives are for large companies with big staffs. Our banks have found a way to deliver these instruments so that the small business owner can use them.' Mr Pearl clearly likes to spread the derivatives gospel. He was one of the co-authors of the Group of Thirty's report into derivatives published this summer, a report that essentially gave the business a clean bill of health. One point on which the G30 placed particular emphasis, was the notion of accountability - the need for the financial officers at companies who use derivatives to keep their senior managers and boards of directors fully informed, both of their activities and the extent of their company's exposures. It is a message that Mr Pearl says McDonald's has always taken seriously. 'We have extensive discussions with the board of directors about these instruments. It's been an ongoing dialogue. In the early days we reported on each transaction we did. To this day, every time they meet we give them a report on our derivatives portfolio marked to market. And for our own senior management, we prepare a report which looks at not only the exposure on a marked-to market basis, but which also provides an analysis of our potential exposures.' He has been McDonald's treasurer since 1988, but the company first began using the products in the early 1980s. Back then, it was a natural progression from the risk management techniques McDonald's was already using, says Mr Pearl. 'We started doing parallel loans in the early 80s, and the next step from parallel loans to swaps was relatively straightforward. If you have been doing three-month foreign exchange contracts, the move out to five-year forward contracts is one that carries somewhat of a different risk, but you're moving along a spectrum, and thus not doing something totally new.' Mr Pearl says the company embraced derivatives early on because they offered a better, and often cheaper, way to control risk, and since the early days it has not strayed that far from the plain vanilla derivatives products that hedge interest rate and currency risk. A look at its derivatives portfolio would show that the company is involved in almost 100 transactions, with 23 different counterparties in 12 currencies. The chief motivation has always been saving money. 'It's critical to understand this about what we do here - our job is to reduce all the costs as much as possible, so we can deliver the best value hamburger to our customers. Therefore, if we can reduce the cost of financings and land acquisitions and construction, we can lower the cost of selling hamburgers to our customers. That is our objective. We are not here to run another business trading derivatives.' The cost savings can come in a variety of ways, says Mr Pearl. 'For example, if our cash flows and cash needs change, and our view of markets change, to go out and call a bond issue, or buy it in the market and reissue shorter-term or longer-term floating debt, can be a very expensive proposition. However, doing it through derivatives is very much easier and much less expensive.' Derivatives also provide the company with more flexibility in its financings. 'We did a Danish krona financing - fixed rate krona with US dollar commercial paper. Therefore, we got Danish krona fixed-rate loans at 100 basis points below local financing sources. This, at a time when the local bond market did not do fixed rate financing.' Mr Pearl also cites an example of how the company used equity options to reduce the cost of a Dollars 700m stock buy-back programme. Occasionally, McDonald's employs more complex, hybrid forms of derivatives, such as a few years ago when they issued inverse floating rate bonds with coupons that, if interest rates went down, the rate went up. 'We swapped those into commercial paper borrowings. It was pretty esoteric, but the essence of the deal was that we created financing below the cost of our commercial paper financing.' McDonald's does not use derivatives in a speculative fashion, to earn a profit from the products. 'I've often been asked about whether we make money. Well, we don't keep track of it that way. We think of each financing, and ask: does it make economic sense relative to the alternatives?' The number of staff working with derivatives at McDonald's is small. Mr Pearl has five with him - one director, two managers and two analysts - out of a total of 30. It was different in the early 1980s, when derivatives were still new, and only a few corporations were using them. Mr Pearl can get nostalgic about the early days. 'The economics used to be much better. We used to be able to do some swaps that got us 100 basis points below libor. Sadly, those days are gone forever.'</p>

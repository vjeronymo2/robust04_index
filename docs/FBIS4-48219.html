			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] The Government of Sierra Leone yesterday published  the names of former cabinet ministers and others rounded up and  detained a week ago. Speculation at the time of their arrest  said that they had been picked up for failure to repay to public  funds huge sums of money which commissions of inquiry had found  them guilty of obtaining through corrupt practices. From  Freetown, Victor Sylver telexed this report.    The Sierra Leonean Government has now published 19 names as  those recently arrested and detained at Pademba Road maximum  security prison in Freetown. All but two of the detainees are  former ministers or deputy ministers in the government of  ex-President Joseph Momoh. The 17 politicians include two  women: (Emeckley Simbo) and Matilda Conteh, both former deputy  ministers. Others include former Foreign Minister Abdul Karim  Koroma, former Development Minister Sheku Kanu, former Transport  and Communication Minister Michael Abdulai, and the former  minister for party affairs. The two nonpoliticians detained are  Mohamed Bangura, a businessman, and the former head of the  Sierra Leone Fire Brigade, Allassan Kamara. All 19 were picked  up by the police after an announcement from the government last  Saturday [7 May] morning that while some of those asked to  refund various sums to the government had done so, others have  not. Three commissions of inquiry into corruption found they  had stolen these funds from the government.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Zvornik, 23 Feb (TANJUG)--Major General Manojlo  Milovanovic, chief of staff of the main headquarters of the  Srpska republic army, told TANJUG today that the Serb side had  not opened fire on members of UNPROFOR's [UN Protection Forces]  Swedish unit yesterday.    "According to coordinates given by Gen. Angus Ramsey,  UNPROFOR's chief of staff for former Bosnia-Herzegovina, it is  clear that this attack launched from antiaircraft weapons could  have not been launched by the Srpska republic army," Milovanovic  said.    UNPROFOR said that the attack took place at the village of  Ribnica (coordinates 9010), four kms northeast of Kakanj; the  nearest Serb position is 22 kms as the crow flies, he stressed.    "Despite indisputable facts, Gen. Ramsey threatened on  several occasions last night and yesterday that he would  personally authorize NATO air strikes on Serbs," Gen.  Milovanovic said.    However, he added, Gen. Michael Rose, commander of UNPROFOR  in former Bosnia-Herzegovina, reacted adequately and demanded a  detailed investigation of yesterday's incident.    "I am certain that the investigation will confirm that the  Serb side did not fire on the Swedes," Milovanovic said.  [passage omitted]</p>

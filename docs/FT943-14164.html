			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Aluminium club's membership remains limited Aluminium producing countries taking part in the unprecedented international agreement to cut global production have not been able to find a formula that would enable Brazil, the Gulf States and Venezuela to be included. Only delegates from the original six participants - Australia, Canada, the 12-nation European Union negotiating as one, Norway, Russia and the US - are to attend the monitoring meeting in Canberra, Australia, on July 20 and 21. There is also some disquiet in the aluminium industry about the degree of Russian commitment to the agreement. Its two senior negotiators at previous trade talks, Mr Georgi Gabounia, a deputy minister in the Ministry for Foreign Economic Relations, and Mr Igor Prokopov, head of the country's aluminium industry association, are believed not to be attending the Canberra meeting. However, one delegate suggested Mr Gabounia's absence was because he had been promoted and it was hoped that both men would be replaced at the meeting by people of equivalent stature. Russia undertook to cut its annual aluminium production by 500,000 tonnes in two stages, the second 200,000-tonne tranche was to have been completed by the end of this month. Some delegates suggest the most sensitive issue at the meeting next week will be the question of how much Russian production has been cut so far and what the other countries can do to impress upon the Russians that they should stand by their commitments. There are indications, however, that the Russians have started to supply production figures to the International Primary Aluminium Institute, the London-based organisation which collates statistics for the industry. At a meeting last January, delegates estimated that world-wide annual output cuts of between 1.5m and 2m tonnes for two years were needed to bring the aluminium market back into balance. Since then western companies have announced planned cuts of more than 1m tonnes and stocks have begun to fall. Prices have responded by jumping by about 50 per cent and recently touched the highest level for 40 months. Nevertheless, the European industry in particular remains disappointed that some important aluminium producing countries not represented at the trade talks have failed to make cuts. It has been pressing for Brazil, the Gulf States and Venezuela to be invited to future talks on the grounds that their reluctance to share the industry's pain by cutting output by about 10 per cent is understandable because they did not take part in the original discussions. However, US trade delegates strenuously resisted any broadening of the scheme on the advice of Justice Department lawyers, who are worried about anti-trust problems. The more countries involved in the scheme, the more it might look like an illegal cartel, the lawyers argue. It was for this reason that Japan, one of the biggest aluminium consuming nations, was excluded from the negotiations although it asked to join in. Two Gulf Arab aluminium producers said yesterday that they had no immediate plans to change their combined output of about 690,000 tonnes annually, reports Reuter from Manama, Bahrain. But Mr Gudvin Tofte, chief executive of Aluminium Bahrain (Alba), said the company's management was watching the market before making any decision on whether to change Alba's current output of around 445,000 tonnes per year. 'We are watching the situation day by day. . . watching the price and what other producers are doing,' he said. 'Based on these developments, we will adjust our output. We will wait and see for a while.' Another Gulf Arab producer, Dubai Aluminium Company (Dubal), said it would maintain its current output. 'Dubal is not planning a cut in its current production of around 245,000 metric tonnes annually,' said Chief Executive Edward Ian Rugeroni.</p>

Besides, he said, we will be able to  manufacture the ultramodern Light Combat Aircraft [LCA] within  the next two years. He also said the Defense Research Division  is eager to undertake research on modern technical know-how and  surpass the obstacles erected by Western countries. Dr. Abdul  Kalam, known as the father of Indian missile technology, is a  great expert.    A conference of dignitaries from various Defense Ministry  research divisions was held in New Delhi. Several personalities  participated, including Air Chief Marshal S.K. Kaul. Dr. Abdul  Kalam disclosed some facts to the scientists that participated  in the conference. He said: The Western countries have  declined to provide India with the latest technical know-how  required by the military, especially by the Air Force. Under  these circumstances, the government has decided to undertake new  ventures based on our indigenous technical know-how.  Accordingly, a committee of scientists from various important  defense units, including the Defense Ministry and Air Force  Research Wing, has been established. We need ultramodern  technical know-how for our defense sector, because we know the  position of the erstwhile Soviet Union since its fragmentation.  Therefore, we cannot afford to be at anyone's mercy. The LCA  light fighter aircraft will be manufactured by June 1996. The  LCA is the smallest fighter plane used in the various parts of  the world. It can be operated by one person. This type of  aircraft is the lightest one; it is used for various purposes on  the battle front. This aircraft, which can fly very fast and  change altitudes very quickly, will be manufactured within the  next two years.</p>

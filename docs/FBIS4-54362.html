			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 26 KYODO -- Japanese farmers demanded  more freedom in producing and marketing their rice in a  three-week series of hearings held nationwide by a government  advisory council, government officials said Thursday [26 May].    The Agricultural Administration Council wound up the  hearings  Thursday with a session in Miyazaki, southern Japan.    The hearings were intended to solicit views of farmers and  consumers to help the council work out plans for agricultural  reforms, following Japan's agreement last December at the  Uruguay Round of global trade talks to partially open its rice  market.    Most participating farmers supported in principle the  continuation of the nation's food control system, under which  the government controls production and distribution of rice, the  officials said.    But farmers sought greater freedom in allotting their rice  stocks for free distribution. Currently, the government allows  40 percent of the nation's rice harvest to be freely marketed  outside government channels by farmers' groups and rice dealers.    Most rice farmers and consumers also said rice should be  stockpiled to deal with a poor rice crop, like the 1993 crop  failure that forced Japan to resort to emergency rice imports.    Some said 1.5 million to 2 million tons of rice should be  stockpiled, the officials said.</p>

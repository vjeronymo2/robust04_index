			<p><P> October 28, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FUNDS FOR FORMER PRESIDENTS  </P> <P> My heart bleeds for all four seeing as how they are forced to live on a mere  presidential pension of $99,500 annually, plus federal financing of office  space, furnishings, travel, mail and first-class medical care. Not to mention  private income from speeches, books, articles, business and investments, etc.  Doesn't the $3-trillion budget deficit tax-burdened public care that we are  supporting another "royal" family every four to eight years?  </P> <P> I hear Ron and Nancy have traveled to Japan for 11 days to entrance the  Japanese television public with Teflon "cowboy" big business commercials for $2  million-plus.  </P> <P> What irks me even more is that there were only four senators on the Senate  floor when a voice vote was taken, without debate, on the $18.4 billion measure  which included the bonus for the ex-presidents. Where were the other 96  senators and what are we paying them for? If they were employed in the private  sector they'd get kicked out on their ear pronto. Why don't we do the same?  </P> <P> MAXINE WOLF  </P> <P> Venice  </P></p>

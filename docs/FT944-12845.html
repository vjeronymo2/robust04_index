			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / Cola war hots up as Safeway launches own-label drink Safeway, Britain's third-biggest food retailer, is joining the cola war with the launch of an own-label drink called Safeway Select, putting further pressure on brand leaders Coca-Cola and Pepsi. Safeway's product, on sale in all its stores from today, follows the launch of Classic Cola by J. Sainsbury, the UK's biggest supermarket group, and of Mr Richard Branson's Virgin Cola. The launch throws Britain's three leading superstore chains into a battle, since Virgin has signed a six-month exclusive distribution deal with Tesco. All three products are made by the same manufacturer, the Canadian soft drinks company Cott, but each claims to have its own unique formulation with which to attack the UK cola market, said by Safeway to be worth Pounds 1.3bn a year. Safeway was approached by Cott soon after the launch of Sainsbury's Classic, with a blend that Cott developed for Safeway of the US - which owned the UK company before selling it to Argyll group in 1987. Mr Roger Partington, Safeway's marketing director, said: 'Safeway Select poses a new challenge to Coke and Pepsi, which were unrivalled in the UK cola market until the arrival of the new wave of own-brand colas this year.' The three-way cola battle starts as the leading food retailers continue to compete fiercely on basic food prices. According to the latest pricing survey by Verdict, the retail research group, the average price of a basket of 40 everyday items in superstores has fallen 17.6 per cent over two years. The gap between the superstore and discounter averages has closed from Pounds 4.12 - 12 per cent - to Pounds 1.61 - 5 per cent. The most expensive superstore chain this month was Safeway, at Pounds 33.88, but the most expensive group overall was a discounter, First Discount, operated by Central Midlands Co-operative Society, at Pounds 37.09. The cheapest superstore chain was Asda at Pounds 30.60, and the cheapest discounter Scotland's Shoprite at Pounds 27.10. Quarterly Food Pricing Survey. Verdict, 112 High Holborn, London WC1V 6JS.

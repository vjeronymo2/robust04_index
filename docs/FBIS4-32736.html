			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Law on Census -- Discriminating and Tendentious for the </F> Albanians -- Albanian Deputy to the Macedonian Parliament Hysen  Shaqiri States" -- ATA headline]    [Text] Tirana, June 24 (ATA) -- The Law on the Census is  discriminating and tendentious for the Albanians, the Albanian  deputy to the Macedonian Parliament, Hysen Shaqiri, the only  deputy who voted against the Law on the Census in The Former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYROM], said in his interview  with ATA.    At the moment this law was voted, he said, more than 60 per  cent of the Albanian population have not been able to obtain the  nationality document. Also, sanctioning by law the division in  resident and non-resident categories is another aggravating  factor for the Albanians, as it is known that a very great  number of them are found today in various countries of the world.    The motives for the census are political, the Albanian  deputy  says stressing that "The manipulation to reduce in the maximum  and artificially the number of the Albanian population and the  tendency to prove the absurd Slav thesis about the  `non-autochthony of the Albanians in the territories on which  they are residing today,' are manifested in the classification  in citizens with nationality and without nationality."    Albanian deputies voted for the Law on the Census under the  pressure of the Macedonian state power and under the illusion  created by the official propaganda about seriousness and  fairness of the census, Mr. Shaqiri says.    But, one day before the beginning of the census, they asked  for the postponement of the schedule and change of the law  because of the Albanians' reaction to unfairness in the law and  preparatory procedures for the beginning of the census.    "If we enrol now, the consequences will be catastrophic for  us," he said adding that: "We must not give up persistence for  the completion of the necessary documents, despite numerous  obstacles created by the state administration, and participate  in the census at a proper time."    "It is not us, the Albanians, that have boycotted the  census,  but it is the law itself and the unilateral application of its  preparatory procedures that have boycotted us," the Albanian  deputy says, stressing that he, himself, although a deputy of  the parliament of The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, has  not been able to obtain the nationality document.</p>

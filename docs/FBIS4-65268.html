			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Kostas Venizelos] </F>   [Text] The UN Security Council will call on UN Secretary  General Butrus Butrus-Ghali to prepare specific proposals to  break the deadlock on the Cyprus issue and submit them to it for  examination. Following the failure of the Vienna talks, the  various countries involved in the Cyprus issue are tending in  this direction.    According to I SIMERINI's information, there will be a  period  of background negotiations to prepare new proposals with new  procedures after Butrus-Ghali submits his report to the Security  Council. Unofficial efforts to urge the Turkish side to accept  the confidence-building measures are not being ruled out.    Foreign diplomats in Nicosia said the new effort will focus  on these new ideas and the confidence-building measures, but  added that they hope that during the procedure the Turkish side  will accept the confidence-building measures in some form. They  insist that this is the basis of the talks on a solution.  Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas puts his side's demands in  coded language and he persists in creating a pseudodilemma, with  the goal of showing that there are only two choices in the  Cyprus issue: recognition of the pseudostate or union of the  occupied areas with Turkey. During the Vienna talks, Denktas'  advisers clarified the positions that were advanced during this  period.    1. Joint management of Famagusta and promotion of separate  sovereignty; this would be a model for a future settlement.    2. Rejection of the proposal to reinstate the law that  existed until December 1963. They want laws to be approved by  both communities and the directors of the two areas. (This  position stems from their view that they do not recognize the  Republic of Cyprus)    3. Because the airport will not go into operation at the  same  time as the opening of Famagusta, they want to control the  passages there in order to be able to block off the city if they  are unsatisfied with the implementation of the  confidence-building measures.    Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary general's alternate  special  representative in Cyprus, and UN political adviser John Paul  Kavanagh yesterday worked hard to prepare Butrus-Ghali's report.  Robert Lamb, the U.S. State Department special coordinator on  the Cyprus issue, has finished briefing the British Foreign  Office. Talks are expected in the next few days on the various  scenarios that will be followed. This will be done in a period  when the United States, just like Britain, is acting especially  quietly because it does not want to disturb Turkey. This is a  fact that will be considered in the UN secretary general's  report and the UN Security Council resolutions.</p>

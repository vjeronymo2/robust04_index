			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: FDA to reconsider Upjohn injectable contraceptive UPJOHN, the US drugs company, has applied to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the hopes of getting approval to market an injectable contraceptive product in the US. The company said it would seek approval a second time to market the drug Depo-Provera as a contraceptive. In the 1970s, the FDA declined to give the green light for the drug's marketing as a contraceptive because of questions about its safety. A board of public inquiry, later asked by Upjohn to review the FDA decision, ruled against the company in 1984. The key concern at the FDA was data from an Upjohn study suggesting Depo-Provera caused breast cancer in beagles. The FDA has since decided the beagle dog is not an appropriate animal model for predicting cancer effects in humans. The drug is, however, already on the US market for use in treating kidney and endometrial cancers. Analysts estimate its US sales at about Dollars 108m, while the revenues from non-US markets, where the drug is sold in some 90 countries as a contraceptive and as an anti-cancer product, are estimated at an additional Dollars 74m. More than 30m women in 60 countries are understood to use the drug as a contraceptive. Although Upjohn has not conducted any new studies of the drug since withdrawing its last application, the company has told the FDA that a study by the World Health Organisation concluded the use of Depo-Provera as a contraceptive did not constitute a health risk. In a separate development, the chairman of Warner Lambert, the US pharmaceutical and consumer products group, yesterday said he expected the company's second-quarter 1992 net earnings per share to rise by 13 per cent year-on-year, suggesting a net profit of about Dollars 175m. The second-quarter 1992 earnings per share would be about Dollars 1.30, against Dollars 1.15 in the same period of 1991. Mr Melvin Goodes said the quarterly earnings rise would place Warner-Lambert on track to improve full-year 1992 earnings by about 15 per cent. The full-year comparison, however, is only appropriate when comparing the company's 1991 earnings before a Dollars 544m accounting adjustment, and other restructuring charges. Warner-Lambert actually recorded 1991 net income of only Dollars 34.8m after all charges were taken. Mr Goodes said the company's second-quarter sales rise would exceed the 8 per cent increase of the first three months of 1992, when sales totalled Dollars 1.3bn. That would suggest a sales rise of about 13 per cent, to Dollars 1.4bn, compared with the second quarter of last year. Warner-Lambert's chairman said second-quarter sales gains were across-the-board, with both the drug and consumer divisions showing strength. Wall Street seemed unmoved by Warner-Lambert's forecast; the share price declined by Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 59 1/8 .</p>

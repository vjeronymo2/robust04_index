			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / Construction Contracts: Supplying navigation systems AB PHAROS MARINE has won a contract worth Pounds 18.4m from the Phillipines Department of Transportation &amp; Communications for the supply and installation of 100 marine aids to navigation systems. The equipment consists of 98 solar-powered lighthouses and lightbeacons with ranges extending for eight to 22 miles. Also to be delivered are two lightvessels for marking a traffic separation scheme in Manila Bay, and a radio monitoring system by which information on the operational status of some 100 individual stations will be reported to Phillipines Coastguard headquarters in Manila; the monitoring system will employ long-range VHF radio using advanced transmission techniques. The Phillipines authorities have a forward plan for major upgrading of their aids-to-navigation network, and this project is the first stage to improve the safety and efficiency of inter-island and international shipping routes. Financing for the project comprises a mixed credit package consisting of a 35 per cent grant from the UK Overseas Development Administration and 65 per cent from a long-term loan by the Bank of America's London branch, supported by the EGCD. The first shipment under the project is expected to be delivered in May.</p>

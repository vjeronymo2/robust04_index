			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> AROUND THE SOUTH BAY: GROWERS EAGER TO SELL THEIR BOUNTY FIND CITY FOLKS  WANTING TO STOCK UP AT SAN PEDRO FARMER'S MARKET.  </P> <P> Each Thursday morning, Carletta Thorsell and Doris Shipman meet in downtown San  Pedro, where they share casual conversation and conduct business across a table  that is blanketed with the bounty of California's fertile soil.  </P> <P> "It's marvelous," declares Shipman, who buys Italian parsley from Thorsell.  "The fruit and vegetables are fresher here. They're right from the farm."  </P> <P> And so they are, at the San Pedro Farmer's Market.  </P> <P> A weekly affair on 3rd Street, the market is a wash of colors, smells and  sounds -- the shouting of questions ("How much for that cauliflower?"), the  clinking of coins as they change hands from city slicker to rural farmer, the  rustle of plastic bags filled with plump red tomatoes or sweet yellow corn.  </P> <P> It is a place an artist might relish. The crinkles etched into the farmers'  faces, the smooth and rough textures of the fruit and vegetables, the slant of  the sunlight as it hits the metal scales -- all might serve as fine material  for a painting or a photograph.  </P> <P> Artistic enlightenment, however, is not the goal of the San Pedro Farmer's  Market.  </P> <P> The goal, says manager Dale Whitney, is far more plain and practical: to bring  good, healthy produce at reasonable prices to residents of San Pedro,  particularly its low-income and elderly population, while providing small  family farmers with a place to make enough profit to stay in business.  </P> <P> The market, which has been operating in San Pedro since 1985, is associated  with two others, both in Long Beach. The three do business under the umbrella  name of Harbor Area Farmers Markets, and are sponsored jointly by the First  Congregational Church in Long Beach and the South Coast Ecumenical Council.  </P> <P> "Many of these (farmers) are (from) very small-time farms," says Nan Nutt,  administrator at the First Congregational Church. "They're not your big  agribusiness and they need this sort of outlet in order to keep going. They  don't have enough to furnish Von's supermarket, and so they're willing to drive  all night to be here to sell their produce."  </P> <P> Indeed, farmers come from as far north as Visalia and as far south as the  Mexican border to sell their goods in San Pedro. "It's a lot of driving," says  Visalia farmer Danny Pritchett, who sells plums, nectarines, apples, apricots,  lemons and anything else, he says, that grows on a tree.  </P> <P> Pritchett says he sells between $400 and $600 of produce each Thursday at the  San Pedro market. Like many small farmers who find it more lucrative to sell  directly to consumers than to packing houses or supermarkets, Pritchett makes  the rounds of Southern California's farmer's markets; San Pedro is one of five  markets he frequents each week.  </P> <P> Produce at the San Pedro market ranges from the standard to the exotic. It is  as easy to find guava, persimmon and pink lentils as it is to find apples,  grapefruit and oranges.  </P> <P> For instance Thorsell, who works for Top Veg Farms in nearby Carson, offers  Chinese long beans, Japanese cucumbers and bitter melon -- which doesn't look  like melon at all, but more closely resembles a pale green zucchini with warts.  (Bitter melon, Thorsell volunteers, is usually stir-fried with tomatoes or  onions and is believed to have medicinal properties.)  </P> <P> Whitney, a Presbyterian minister who recently gave up his full-time post at a  Long Beach church to manage the harbor area markets, says the key to a  successful farmer's market is location: The market ought to be on the border  between an affluent community, where residents might spend more for unusual  fruits and vegetables like those Thorsell sells, and a poor one, where  residents need the staples at affordable prices.  </P> <P> In San Pedro, the 3rd Street location fits that bill. The market is near the  commercial core and around the corner from the headquarters of the Los Angeles  Harbor Department, but across the street from Rancho San Pedro, a public  housing project.  </P> <P> It attracts residents like Leslie Sharp, who says she comes "when my car  happens to be working or when I can get a ride" and non-residents like Marla  Silverman, who works as a real estate officer at the Harbor Department and  lives in West Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "They seem to taste a little bit fresher, so I do try to buy all my fruits and  vegetables there," said Silverman, who favors Japanese plums and the vast  selection of sprouts sold by a vendor who runs a greenhouse in Venice Beach.  </P> <P> Said Alfred Fischer, a San Pedro resident who teaches geology at the University  of Southern California: "I would much rather shop in a market like this than a  supermarket. . . . You're closer to the soil this way." Sheryl Stolberg  </P></p>

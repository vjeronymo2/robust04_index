			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vasiliy Selyunin: "After the Elections: Whose </F> Program Is Realistic?"]    [Text] At KURANTY's request, noted economist and  commentator Vasiliy Selyunin has researched and compared the  feasibility of the three electoral coalitions that got a  considerable number of seats in the State Duma fulfilling their  economic programs.    I will deal with only the main directions of the programs.    Let us start with the Russia's Choice program. It does not  contain populist promises or idle talk. Priority problems are  clearly identified, and the program says what needs to be done  and how.    The cornerstone is bringing down inflation, that is,  bringing  it down to 3 percent a month by the end of 1994. This is a bit  too much as compared to countries with stable economies (which  have 2-4 percent a year), but it would still make our life  easier than it is now. In August inflation was 28 percent; in  September a little less--22 percent; in October--24 percent; and  in November--15 percent. I should note that how steadily  inflation subsides will depend on how we all work.    It was inflation more than anything else that pushed the  voters into Zhirinovskiy's embrace. It irritates people more  than high prices and a low standard of living, especially  considering that in 1993 the latter rose somewhat as compared to  1992, although we still have not returned to the standard of  living of the relatively prosperous years. The entire decline in  the standard of living occurred during the first year of reforms.    Our country is not the first or the last to fall into the  inflation trap. Inflation, like an invisible thief, picks every  pocket. It would seem that people are already paid relatively  well--the average monthly wage in Russia has long exceeded the  100,000-ruble [R] mark, but this money melts away in front of  our very eyes. You have to run and buy something quick, because  prices go up instantly. I would not even mention that at this  level of inflation it is impossible to save rubles. Every family  loses in this respect, and the poor more than all the others.    If we manage to bring inflation down, every family will  benefit, too. This will by itself raise the standard of living.  Besides, capital investment is only possible after inflation has  been reined in. There are no precedents in the immense history  of the world of investment and growth of production beginning  before inflation is brought down. This does not happen.    That is why Russia's Choice did not promise that next year  would be a year of economic growth, rather that the work of the  government should create the preconditions for it beginning in  1995, provided there is stability in the country. Do not jerk  the government; give it a year to work normally, and the  conditions will be laid down for Russia's development for the  next 10-15 years. Then you will not recognize our country. After  all, there has been a Japanese miracle, Italian, Spanish, and  German... There will be a Russian one, too. But it took every  country 10-15 years. This is a normal time frame. It is silly to  believe in a fast--and double at that--increase in the  population's income, as LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of  Russia] leader Zhirinovskiy promised.    Taxes are another acute issue in the programs, which  affected  voter sympathies. Russia's Choice said honestly: It is  impossible to cut taxes right now. And I will add that lowering  them would be useless from the standpoint of economic  development. Until inflation is brought down, the benefits  accrued to tax-paying goods producers would immediately go into  raising salaries rather than investment. Income freed from taxes  would be converted to wages. And nothing else.    The Russia's Choice program envisages three kinds of taxes.  The greater part of the tax on profit and value-added tax  remains in local budgets. These are local, or municipal, taxes.  There are regional taxes, which are collected, for instance,  into the budget of an oblast, kray, or republic. In my  estimation, approximately one-third of all taxes should be  transferred into the federal budget. This sensible taxation  creates an economic foundation for staving off sovereignization  of Russia's regions. Create conditions for local enterprises'  operations and collect taxes from them for the local budget,  because they are mostly local.    Draft laws are ready on real estate taxes and introducing a  tax for use of natural resources. Most countries do this. The  total sum of taxes does not increase; it is simply that part of  it is shifted from tax on profit into tax on real estate and  natural resources.    The program for bringing inflation down is realistic, and it  is already being implemented. Taking advantage of the fact that  nobody interfered with the government's work over the past few  months, preferential credits to sectors and enterprises were  suspended already in September. I was baffled, though, to see  the president sign an edict giving agriculture preferential  credit in the amount in excess of R300 billion a few days ago.  This is an unpleasant deviation from the program, but not a  catastrophic one. In essence, it is again propping up kolkhozes  and sovkhozes, and one can see why: the agrarian lobby is  pushing it.    Tax preferences with respect to tax on profit and  value-added  tax have been reduced. So many preferences have proliferated  that nobody knew any more who was supposed to pay taxes to the  treasury, and how much.    Another anti-inflation measure: All import subsidies have  been removed, except subsidies for purchases of medications and  medical equipment. Until recently such subsidies consumed 12  percent of total national income. Now if you want to buy  something for dollars--be my guest, but buy your dollars at the  current exchange rate like everybody else and stop begging the  treasury for cheap hard currency. There had been incidents when  the treasury, sympathetic to someone in a bind--textile  producers need to buy dyes, they would say, and car makers need  to buy equipment (everyone had a good reason)--sold dollars tens  or even hundreds times below their market value.    Various nonbudget funds have been merged into budget funds,  that is, they came under the jurisdiction of the government.  This is also a serious anti-inflation measure. It is outrageous  when the means of nonbudget funds exceed the entire Russian  budget, as happened last year. The pension fund had been under  the control of the Supreme Soviet; social security by tradition  was the province of trade unions; the fuel and energy complex  had its own fund; and so on... The result was that the  government had under its control a smaller part of national  finances than the agencies that controlled nonbudget funds. It  is impermissible for several financial systems to operate within  one country.    I am enumerating only those anti-inflation measures that  have  already been implemented or are in the process of being  implemented; this means that the Russia's Choice program is  quite realistic as long as they stick to it.    Of course, anti-inflation measures are harsh. If, for  instance, a defense enterprise does not get preferential credit,  it may potentially face bankruptcy, which will cause  unemployment and possibly a social explosion. But unless tough  anti-inflation measures are taken, we will see a Ukrainization  of the Russian economy. What this entails is quite graphic.  There is no alternative, and Russia's Choice said so honestly,  which is the main distinguishing feature of this program as  compared to others.    Ninety percent of the major program planks of G.  Yavlinskiy's  bloc probably coincide with the Russia's Choice program.  Nevertheless, each plank in Yavlinskiy's program is preceded by  berating the government: We would have done it better!  Naturally, they do not say how.    There is, however, one principal difference. G. Yavlinskiy  proposes to stretch the anti-inflation program through 1997.  Broken down by year, it looks like this: 1994--monthly inflation  at 15-20 percent, that is, it remains at the current level. In  1995--10-15 percent a month. In 1996 inflation will be reduced  to 3-8 percent, and in 1997--2 percent a month.    Now let us look what a monthly inflation of 15-20 percent  will bring us next year. Prices will rise 10-fold over the year.  This year we also had a ninefold increase in prices, and we say  quite correctly that it is impossible to go on living this way.    If the current rate of inflation remains for the entire  1994,  as G. Yavlinskiy's program proposes, it will, of course, create  a reserve for the implementation of social programs and support  for priority sectors in production. But this will be support  provided by paper money not backed up by anything, or by empty  figures in noncash transactions.    I cannot say that stretching the anti-inflation thrust is  the  result of evil intentions or thoughtlessness. The leaders of  this bloc see the situation differently and, in my opinion,  overestimate the potential for social explosion resulting from  some sector not getting subsidies or the absence of new social  programs. But it has already become clear to the population that  when production declines, handing money out to enterprises does  not raise the standard of living.    G. Yavlinskiy's program envisages budget investment in  sectors that act as locomotives, that is, those that will pull  along other sectors and bring them up. At the top of the list,  however, are budget investments in....the space program and  aviation industry, followed by housing construction. Of course,  the Russia's Choice program, too, envisages support for some  sectors, but why give the space program priority? Such priority  seems very questionable to me, because the treasury's ability is  very limited. And, as I have already mentioned, budget  investment is completely impermissible. We are already fed up  with it. Practically all investment in the Soviet economy came  from the budget, that is, from the state.    We had 500,000 ongoing construction projects, spreading the  money thin, burying it into the soil and foundations, and did  not properly complete a single needed construction project. And  what we did build turned out to either be harmful, such as  canals, or a nonpriority, such as the BAM [Baykal-Amur Main  Line], because it was the state that decided where to put the  money.    Budget investment may be justified perhaps in construction  of  housing for the poor and perhaps in railroads with the  participation of private joint-stock capital. But, I repeat,  investment, especially private (which should comprise the  predominant part of it), is only possible when the ruble is  stable, not in the conditions of 15-20 percent a month  inflation. There are no fools.    G. Yavlinskiy's program also contains purely populist  promises; for instance, it promises--and at a rather high level  at that--budget support for science and culture. If this is so,  it would be good to be more precise regarding at whose expense  such support would be achieved. Science will get support, but  someone else's share in the budget will be reduced. Whose?  Pensioners? Teachers or doctors; builders or miners? There is no  other method of budget financing.    Over the past three years the share of science and culture  in  the budget has not diminished, but remained at the same level.  But in real rubles, of course, the magnitude of appropriations  has dropped by about 30 percent. The share of science and  culture in the budget will be filled with increasingly greater  amounts of money not expropriated from others only as the  economy begins to pick up.    It is more difficult to comment on Zhirinovskiy's economic  program, since it is scattered all over in verbal statements and  publications, although some points of it have been announced. As  an economist, however, I cannot seriously analyze it. The  program consists of a bunch of populist promises, most of which  cannot be fulfilled. Those that are in fact realistic already  have been or are being implemented by the government, but  Vladimir Volfovich still makes these promises.    His biggest promise to the voters is to double the  population's real income in a matter of six months.    "How do we do that?" Zhirinovskiy was asked. He named two  major, in his opinion, sources.    First--stop nonrepayable aid to CIS countries. But the  government has already done this. Beginning 1 January 1994  Russia will trade with CIS countries only at world prices.  Nonpayments or debts of former republics have been converted  into credits. True, the interest rate is a bit low, but we  cannot get more from them. So, the first source of immediate  enrichment for the population named by Zhirinovskiy already has  been exhausted.    The second source, in his opinion, is to stop conversion and  sell arms. He told the public the figure of earnings from arms  sales: allegedly $30-32 billion a year. Such earnings have never  existed, and cannot be real. Theoretically, the USSR sold this  much worth of arms. But last year income from arms sales was  slightly less than $2 billion. And prior to that Russia did not  get anything for arms deliveries to regimes friendly to the  USSR. All in all, the Communists left Russia an "inheritance" of  $130 billion. This is how much has been handed out to other  countries, and mainly it is debts for arms shipments. None of  the debtors has ever paid or intends to pay. It is hardly  realistic to demand these billions in payments. India and Egypt  pay some, but this is small change. Cuba alone owes us $18  billion, and they are merely laughing: the debt we incurred was  not to Russia, they say. Thus, earnings of $30-32 billion a year  from arms sales belongs in the realm of nonscientific fiction.    Thus, the sources through which Zhirinovskiy promised to  double the population's real income in six months simply do not  exist.    His program also promises support for state enterprises, but  it does not say how this would be done. If it is support through  preferential credits, inflation will have to be let loose.    I do not think I need to repeat what will happen next....    V. Zhirinovskiy promises regulated prices. As it turned out,  this is the most desirable device in the understanding of most  voters. But if we begin regulating prices, we will inevitably  have to freeze wages. Otherwise, wages will jump, and with fixed  prices the population will sweep the stores clean. As a result,  the stores will be empty and money will be worth absolutely  nothing. In this respect, too, Zhirinovskiy proposes a  Ukrainization of the Russian economy without using this  particular word.    The harm done to Russia by Zhirinovskiy's foreign policy  statements is already obvious; this is being enunciated quite  clearly. Through Zhirinovskiy's efforts, NATO is moving closer  to Russia's borders; Ukraine has practically rejected nuclear  disarmament; he has threatened Japan with a nuclear bomb, and  all of us--with friendship with S. Husayn.    Zhirinovskiy is war, poverty, complete disintegration of the  economy, and hyperinflation.</p>

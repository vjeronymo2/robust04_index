			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Rise in EC spending proposed THE European Commission approved the first draft of the 1994 European Community budget yesterday, pencilling in a 7 per cent rise in spending to Ecu70.1bn (Pounds 55.4bn) Reuter reports from Brussels. The draft, which is the first stage of the budgetary negotiations between the Commission, EC finance ministers and the European Parliament, compares with this year's budgetted spending of Ecu65.5bn. Spending on the common agricultural policy is pencilled in to rise 7.1 per cent to Ecu36.5bn, but the budget commissioner, Mr Peter Schmidhuber, said that because of recent changes in exchange rate parities affecting the Ecu this was already likely to be Ecu1.5bn short of what was needed. Spending on structural operations is put at Ecu23.2bn up 4.5 per cent, while that on internal policies is put at Ecu4.24bn up 3.3 per cent.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin by Mehmet </F> Alkas in the TRT studio -- live]    [Text] [Alkas] One can observe that the United Nations is  ineffective in the face of the Serbian attacks against the safe  havens in Bosnia-Herzegovina and primarily in Gorazde.  Communication between the UN forces and NATO in  Bosnia-Herzegovina is weak and there is a deficiency in the  execution of duties. What are your views on the issue?    [Cetin] This also derives from the structure of the United  Nations. Current organizations and international institutions,  and especially the United Nations, are conceptualized to suit  the Cold War period. These organizations have not been able to  adapt themselves to the new situation with the elimination of  the Cold War and the two blocs. They were quite deficient in  adapting to the new reality. When we take the United Nations  into consideration, this is one of the problems.    The second problem is that this organization has no  political  will. The political will belongs to the nations. Within the  structure of the United Nations actually it is not the political  will of the 187 members but rather that of the Security Council  members and especially the five permanent members within the  Council. The political will of these five members is actually  reflected or implemented. Since a unity of views cannot be  secured among these five members the United Nations is thus  rendered helpless.    The third point is that the United Nations does not have its  own military force. It can only recruit forces from among its  members. Many times these forces cannot act independently from  these nations. They implement the policies of their countries.    The forth significant point is that the United Nations has  no  power to secure peace. It is trying to secure a peace that is  not stable. There is no peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina. They are  called the peacekeeping forces. How can you keep a peace that  is nonexistent? This also causes some problems.    Now, NATO has reached a decision saying that if the United  Nations makes an appeal to NATO then it will undertake the  necessary operation. Because this region is beyond NATO  jurisdiction. As you have expressed in your question a while  ago, they behaved most indecisively there. This implementation  has affected the credibility and respectability of NATO. When  an appeal was made to NATO one or two planes undertook an  operation. This not only lacked any deterrence it actually  encouraged the Serbs. This is what happened in Gorazde.    Beyond that there were differences of views between the  civilian and military commanders in Bosnia-Herzegovina. For  example, the military commander requested an intervention two  days ago. Whereas, the civilian administrator was opposed to  it. Bosnia-Herzegovina is, in a way, paying the price for all  these negative points. The Bosnian people are paying the price  and Azerbaijan is paying the price in the Caucasus.    Now Gorazde has been under siege for the last 20 days. It  has reached the point that.... [pauses] The United Nations is  powerless. Some 200 UN peacekeeping troops are being held  hostage by the Serbs. In other words they cannot even protect  their own forces, they cannot ensure the security of their own  people. How can such a United Nations protect the people of  Gorazde?    [Alkas] How come the Serbs are so bold?    [Cetin] I believe that the world and these organizations  have not issued a message in the language that the Serbs can  understand. They did not give the message that, if necessary,  they will intervene to the very end. They could not deter them,  they only encouraged them. For example, for the last few days  they gave the impression that an agreement was being reached  while they actually were helping the Serbs gain time.    [Alkas] On the one hand they said they would withdraw and on  the other they continued their attacks.    [Cetin] I talked with the Bosnian president a while ago  before coming to the studio. He said that the situation is very  critical, that no one is intervening, and that the tanks have  begun to enter one section of the city. Of course, the Bosnian  people will not be defeated with the occupation of Gorazde.  They will continue their heroic struggle as they have done for  the last two years.    Given the situation, however, another duty befalls the  United  Nations. Since you cannot protect them then allow them to  protect themselves. Let us try and lift this arms embargo.  Turkey has been working on this from the every beginning. If  you cannot protect the safe havens, if you cannot protect the  people in that region, and if you cannot protect your own  people, then you can at least lift the arms embargo imposed on  Bosnia-Herzegovina and grant the Bosnian army and people to  right to protect themselves.    [Alkas] We thank you, Mr. minister.</p>

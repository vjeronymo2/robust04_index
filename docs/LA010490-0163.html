			<p><P> January 4, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRUISE SHIP MAGNATE SET TO RESCUE FOUNDERING CENTRUST  </P> <P> A proposed merger of troubled CenTrust Bank with a bank owned by a billionaire  cruise ship magnate was announced Wednesday as part of a plan to ward off  regulators from the Miami savings and loan.  </P> <P> The non-binding agreement calls for CenTrust and Ensign Bank to begin talks to  reorganize under a new holding company.  </P> <P> The merger would include a cash infusion from Ensign's parent, Hamilton Holding  Co., which is controlled by Carnival Cruise Lines Inc. principal owner Ted  Arison.  </P> <P> The merger hinges on several conditions, including federal approval of  CenTrust's plans to sell 63 of its 71 branches to Great Western Bank of Beverly  Hills.  </P> <P> In a separate development, federal thrift regulators placed severe restrictions  on the operations of Santa Barbara Savings &amp; Loan Assn., the main thrift  subsidiary of Financial Corp. of Santa Barbara. Financial Corp. said the  restrictions were imposed because the thrift is undercapitalized under federal  standards.  </P> <P> The restrictions prohibit the thrift from all new lending and investment  activity, accepting uninsured deposits or paying dividends on its stock.  </P></p>

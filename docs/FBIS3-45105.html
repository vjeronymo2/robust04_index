Now a new U.S. military strategy is  beginning to take shape. Specifically, its contents are: Full  attention to "economic security," maintaining reasonable  military superiority, and strengthening the power to intervene  in regional conflicts.    What confronted Clinton when he entered the White House was  a  combination of weakening American economic power and a further  destabilized situation in international security. He holds that  the United States should stop approaching national security in  the narrow, Cold War-style military terms. National security is  above all economic security, and economic revitalization should  be an overwhelming priority. The United States could not speak  of itself "as a world leader" if it did not do that.    To realize the strategic goal that "national security means  primarily economic security," the Clinton Administration decided  to conduct an overhaul of U.S. military structure. The military  structure of the Cold War era will be replaced by a smaller but  more flexible military force. The first step is to effect a  reasonable cut in military force. By 1997, total troops on  active service will have been cut to 1.4 million. Second, scale  down the procurement of strategic nuclear weapons and high-tech  conventional weapons, stop the enormously costly Strategic  Defense Initiative project, and propose to reduce national  defense expenditures by one third. Third, implement the  "military-to-civilian conversion" plan to trim the national  defense work force. Fourth, reduce the size of U.S. forces  stationed in Europe and Asia, including slashing overseas  military bases, installations, and troop strength. Fifth,  heighten military attention to areas of concern to U.S. economic  interests. But, in sharp contrast to U.S. overall troop cuts,  troops stationed in the Middle East have been increased from the  original 5,000 to 30,000 at present, indicating U.S. seriousness  about safeguarding its lifeline -- oil.    To ensure that the economic security strategy achieves its  objectives, Clinton has vigorously tried to maintain the United  States' status as the world's only superpower by calling for  adjustment in four areas of its military force. One, while  reducing the nuclear arsenal, the military will maintain a vital  deterrent nuclear force. In line with its nuclear force  deployment principles, this may reduce the targets for nuclear  attack plans but will include Third-World countries possessing  or possibly possessing nuclear weapons as targets for strategic  nuclear weapons. Regarding policies for nuclear force  development, the goal is guaranteed quality, reasonable  curtailment, maintaining research and development, halting  production, scrapping the Strategic Defense Initiative project,  and implementing the "anti-missile defense" plan. Two, changing  the conventional force into a rapid-deployment force ready to  move into areas where U.S. interests are under threat, this will  enable the U.S. to intervene in regional crisis and conflicts  anywhere around the world. Three, maintaining the superior  military quality of the U.S. Army and its advanced weapons.  Funding for developing new weapons technology will continue  even during ongoing military expenditure cuts, the focus being  weapon systems dealing with regional conflicts. Four, building  an intelligence system capable of providing prompt, accurate  analysis of the military, political, economic, and cultural  conditions of an area of potential conflicts.    One notable feature of the Clinton Administration's military  strategy is the increase in the strength of intervention in  regional affairs. This forestalls any change in the  international security structure that may be inimical to the  United States. The Bush Administration's approach to regional  conflicts was premised on the international balance of power and  its use of force was often reactive. Whereas Clinton believes  in limited state sovereignty,favors preemptive measures, and  advocates the legitimacy and efficacy of supra-national military  intervention. To prevent a global proliferation of ballistic  missile technology and weapons of massive destruction, the  United States will exert pressure on, and even "punish,"  companies and countries it believes are selling such technology.  The United States is also stepping up negotiations with all  concerned countries for a strict mandatory international  nonproliferation treaty.    Apart from continuing to stress the role of allies, the  Clinton Administration has repeatedly stressed: Launching peace  diplomacy, its readiness to act alone if necessary, reserving  the right to "selective intervention"--with a majority of  military interventions carrying a distinctivly economic color.  In handling relations with allies, the United States favors  equal emphasis on cooperation and competition; that is, full  cooperation in solving regional conflicts and expenditure and  risk sharing among allies; but competition in economic fields to  force allies to open up their markets. The United States also  stresses the goal of controlling regional conflicts through the  United Nations; different arrangements for security in different  regions; and, above all, maintaining a powerful military  presence in key conflict areas, such as the Middle East, viewed  as a potential model for a regional security pattern.</p>

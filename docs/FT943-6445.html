			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / World Bond Markets: New York Whether the bond market will be able to sustain the upward momentum of the past few trading sessions will depend upon how investors react to the economic data due this week. The most important statistic is the monthly employment data, due on Friday. Wall Street expects the rate of jobs growth to have dropped in August. The consensus of forecasts is for a rise in non-farm payrolls of 225,000, below the 259,000 increase in July and the average monthly increase of 279,000 recorded for the year to date. Little change is expected in the national unemployment rate, which stood at 6.1 per cent last month. If the jobs figures come in at, or below, market forecasts, the bond market could be set for a prolonged period of stability, with a slight bias towards higher prices. Any signs of strength, however, and fears of another interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve will be revived, and last week's gains could dissipate quickly. The July personal income and expenditure, leading indicators and manufacturing orders data are not expected to cause many ripples. However, the August consumer confidence report from the Conference Board could cause trouble if analysts' predictions that consumer confidence rose only slightly this month prove off the mark.</p>

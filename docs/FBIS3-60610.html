Swiss Foreign Minister Flavio Cotti doubted whether anything  more than a vague statement of principles would emerge from the  two-day session of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in  Europe (CSCE).    "The subject is not completely ripe for a decision," Cotti  told reporters as foreign ministers and other representatives of  the CSCE states continued their deliberations.    "There will not be an absolute consensus but a rather broad  accord in principle with strict conditions," he said.    Delegates here said the ministers were generally agreed on  the need to strenghten peacekeeping structures across a Europe  plagued by ethnic and national strife.    But Moscow's request for a mandate in the former Soviet  republics drew warnings of caution from several nations and  opposition from the Baltic states, where Russia still has troops.    They fear Russia could use peacekeeping operations as a  pretext for maintaining control over its former domain.    The Russians, who have deployed forces in such hotspots as  Georgia and Tajikistan, have sought authorisation from the CSCE  or United Nations to give them international legitimacy and  financing.    But officials here said questions remained on the system of  financing, the relationship of Russian troops to their  international supervisors and other issues.    A Swiss diplomat, who asked not to be named, said the CSCE  would ask a group of experts to study the matter and report back  in a few weeks. The aim is to reach a conclusion by a meeting  of CSCE senior officials in Prague in March.    "I understand the fears of certain countries," Cotti said.  "But it is in everybody's interest to see a country, above all a  large country, operating within the framework of international  law."    The Swiss minister said another subject of hot debate here  was pressure on the Ukraine to dismantle the nuclear arsenal it  inherited from the defunct Soviet Union.    Sources said Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev asked  the CSCE to condemn the Ukraine for balking on disarmament and  unconditional ratification of the Strategic Arms Reduction  Treaty [START I).    Ukraine Foreign Minister Anatoly Zlenko reiterated here  Tuesday that his country was moving towards gradual elimination  of its stockpile but required security guarantees and financial  help.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Dick Ljungberg: "Mediocre Passing Grade"] </F>   [Text] Has the government done more or less what it  promised, or has it let the people down? The Temo public opinion  institute has surveyed voter opinion as DAGENS NYHETER continues  to scrutinize the government. The first of a series of  grass-roots voters also express their opinion of the government  and their party leaders.    Nearly half the Swedish voters give the Bildt  government a mediocre passing grade for its years in power. The  government has performed neither better nor worse than expected,  they say. In the nonsocialist corner, supporters of the Center  Party and the KDS [Christian Democratic Party] are the ones most  dissatisfied with the government.    The high unemployment rate is what drags the nonsocialist  government's grade down, but many people are favorably surprised  that it managed to hold together at all.    The above is shown by an opinion poll conducted by Temo for  DAGENS NYHETER to ascertain people's views of the Bildt  government and its policy. The poll, which was concluded last  week, comprised 1,000 interviews.    When asked their views on how well the nonsocialist  government had done its job, 15 percent of Swedes said "better  than expected," 46 percent said "neither better nor worse than  expected," and 36 percent said "worse than expected."  <H5>  Little Difference Between Sexes </H5>   The answers do not reveal any major differences between men  and women or the various age groups. But those saying that the  government has done its job worse than expected are mainly  voters with little education, living in sparsely populated  areas, and earning relatively low incomes.    Naturally, it is primarily Social Democratic and Left Party  voters who feel that the government has performed worse than  expected: a full 47 percent. But 44 percent of Social Democrats  feel that its performance was neither better nor worse than  expected.    The reason, of course, may be that their expectations of how  the Bildt government would do were low to start with. But 7  percent of Social Democrats feel that the government has  performed better than they expected.  <H5>  Some Have Left </H5>   Since the government took office in October 1991, about 10  percent have left the nonsocialist camp, according to the polls.  Many of those are probably to be found among the 47 percent of  the Social Democratic Party's supporters who think the  government has done worse than expected.    Among nonsocialist voters, 48 percent say "neither better  nor  worse." "Better than expected" is the answer given by 27  percent, and 22 percent say "worse than expected." Most  disappointed are Center Party and KDS voters, with 37 percent  and 35 percent respectively feeling that the government has  turned out worse than expected.    Those most pleased, and to a corresponding degree, are  Moderate and Liberal Party voters, where 34 percent and 35  percent respectively feel that the government has performed  better than expected.  <H5>  Asked To Explain </H5>   Those saying that the government had performed better than  expected were asked to explain their answer.    The most common answer, by 38 percent, was that they were  favorably surprised that the government was able to hold  together during the election period. The fact that the  government was able to handle the financial crisis and pursued a  good economic policy was mentioned by 31 percent, mostly  Moderates.    Issues such as the European Union [EU] agreement, low  inflation, privatization, and better conditions for business  were mentioned only in isolated cases.    Of those feeling that the Bildt government has performed  worse than expected, all 48 percent say that unemployment and  the employment policy are the reason. The figure is 27 percent  among nonsocialists and 52 percent among Social Democrats. This  further underscores the fact that unemployment is going to be  the big issue in this fall's election campaign.    Excessive cutbacks in the public sector (the Health Service,  child care, and so on) are mentioned by 26 percent (15 percent  of nonsocialist voters and 29 percent of Social Democratic  voters feeling that the government's performance was worse than  expected).  <H5>  Feel Unfairly Treated </H5>   The government's inequitable policy favoring business and  the  well-to-do and treating the worst off unfairly was the answer  given by 17 percent (11 percent of nonsocialists and 14 percent  of Social Democrats).    Among nonsocialists who are disappointed in the government,  14 percent -- presumably mostly Moderates -- say the reason is  that tax reductions have been too small or nonexistent.</p>

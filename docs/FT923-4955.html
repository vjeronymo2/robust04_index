			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Survey of Distribution Services (3): Mixed pattern of change  -UK retailers are rethinking their policies RECESSION, tougher competition and greater availability of information technology systems are encouraging UK retailers to rethink their distribution policies. But the pattern of actual change is mixed. Some retailers are veering away from contracting out more distribution activities to third party specialists and bringing parts of those operations back in-house. Helping to encourage that change is the continuing development of information technology (IT) systems which can give retailers tight control over areas of distribution activity where they also now have plenty of practical experience. Other retailers, though, are heading in the opposite direction and seeking to establish even closer and wider-ranging partnerships with their distribution service providers. That mixed picture is confirmed by the Research Services Department of the Institute of Grocery Distribution in a study which focused specifically on the involvement of third party specialists in the centralised distribution operations of leading multiple stores. According to IGD research carried out during 1991, third party penetration of that sector ranged from 35-45 per cent for ASDA, J Sainsbury and Tesco and 60-65 per cent for CRS, Gateway and Safeway, to 85-95 per cent for Iceland, Kwik Save and CWS, and 100 per cent for Wm Low and Grandways. Mr John Galloway, logistics director for ASDA Stores, told the recent UK Institute of Logistics &amp; Distribution Management (ILDM) annual conference why his organisation had opted to use a mix of contractors and self-managed distribution operations to service its 206 superstores. 'It allows us to understand the difference between logistics professionals whose aim is to generate a profit and people like ourselves to whom logistics is a cost centre within the overall business,' he said. During the 1980s there was in fact a pronounced general move among retailers towards contracting out more of their distribution operations, a trend confirmed in the 1991/92 Survey of Distribution Costs just published by the ILDM. In the consumer goods (CG) retail sector, for example, the ILDM survey found that around 70 per cent of transport expenditure went on third party dedicated or shared user services and 30 per cent on in-house operations. For the food, drink and tobacco (F D &amp; T) retail sector, the figures were around 48 per cent and 52 per cent respectively. But the picture is changing again, says the ILDM. 'Interestingly, when compared to last year, transport has shifted away from third party, both shared and dedicated, to own account operations,' comments the ILDM. The same survey also found that own-account operations continue to dominate the storage side of distribution activities. There, 85-90 per cent of expenditure by the CG and F D &amp; T retail sectors went on in-house operations. A report published this year by management consultants Price Waterhouse confirms those trends. According to a survey of 'Competitive Trends in Retail Logistics', undertaken with the help of the Cambridge Centre for Competitive Logistics Research, 'while sub-contracted transport services were generally perceived to be adequate to meet competitive requirements over the next two years, 80 per cent of retailers felt that third party warehouse and stock management performance was inadequate.' Other industry surveys and consultants' reports have suggested that there is, or at least has been, considerable dissatisfaction among some retailers over the efficiency of distribution operations run by third party contractors. But a study of retailers and manufacturers carried out on behalf of third party contractor Applied Distribution Limited (ADL) claimed such dissatisfaction has been just as apparent among companies running their own distribution set-ups. 'The main problem for own-account operators was inefficiency, most frequently in vehicle utilisation but also in picking and loading rates,' commented ADL. 'Those using third parties identified two major areas of concern. These were a lack of 'professionalism' and understanding of the client's business, and severe teething problems with newly-established contracts.' Adding to the dissatisfaction of some companies using third party operators, suggests Mr John Kelly, chairman of logistics industry consultants Davies &amp; Robson, have been the terms of their contracts. 'For example, companies found their contractors expecting inflation-linked cost increases at a time when their own turnover is declining,' he said. Not surprisingly, third party distribution companies generally play down suggestions of any large-scale reversion to in-house distribution operations. They blame much of that 'speculation' on a delayed reaction to events in the 1980s when some distribution companies took on contracts for which they did not have the right management and ran into problems. Mr John Harvey, chairman of contract distribution group Tibbett &amp; Britten, says he believes there will a continuing rundown of in-house distribution operations. And he claims retail distribution is likely in future to be increasingly concentrated in the hands of a few large specialist contractors. 'When distribution contracts come up now, we usually only see a very selective list of companies invited even to tender,' he says. Other trends becoming apparent in the retail sector include new types of contract distribution arrange-ments. There are signs in the furniture sector, for instance, of more tripartite agreements. A recent example of that involves a contract won by home delivery specialist Federal Express Systemcare to deliver all orders for Stag Meredew products placed through the Allders Department Stores group. Retailer demand for fast supply of products, often at short notice, is also leading to an increased role in that market for parcels service companies offering overnight delivery. The sort of operation involved is typified by the service parcels carrier Parceline provides for Entertainment UK, a Kingfisher group company which supplies CDs, cassettes, videos and computer games to Woolworths and other major retail groups. Flexibility is all important, explains Mr Glyn Angel, Entertainment UK supplier logistics manager. 'When the demand for a new record release is exceptionally high, it is critical that shops are replenished very quickly. Parceline is able to provide us with extra trailers at short notice to collect and distribute overnight,' he says. Predictably, another development set to strongly influence future patterns of UK retail industry distribution activity is the imminent advent of the European Community Single Market. That development is, for example, likely to increase cross- border distribution activities. And the need to develop pan- European networks could open up new opportunities for third party specialists. 'Controlling the supply chain will become a much larger task and if retailers wish to retain the economies of scale they have gained in the UK, it is likely we will see an increase in demand for the services of logistics specialists with European or global reach,' claims Mr Martyn Pellew, divisional sales and marketing director for Exel Logistics.</p>

			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Regulation issue The creation of the Personal Investment Authority, the proposed self-regulatory body for retail financial services, is starting to resemble an elaborate game of chicken. Standard Life's decision to withdraw its support amounts to a calculated gamble that government can be forced to reconsider legislation and that the resulting statutory system of regulation will be more agreeable than the PIA. With the Prudential already opposed to self-regulation, the defection of a second large life insurer is certainly a blow. Much depends on whether other companies think the opposition bandwagon is worth climbing aboard, although that is unlikely to be clear until the PIA prospectus is published next month. If the PIA cannot command the support of the big life insurers, it is hard to see how the two-tier system of regulation can survive. In theory, Standard Life and Prudential could opt to be regulated directly by the Securities and Investments Board instead. That would be another gamble, since their relationship with the regulator would be antagonistic from the outset. In practice, though, the SIB itself would probably find the position untenable. Such fragmentation would undermine the reasoning behind setting up the PIA in the first place. Proposals for making the two-tier system work, presented to government by SIB chairman Mr Andrew Large last May, centred on devolving direct regulation away from SIB itself. In the meantime, government will doubtless continue to reject legislation, for fear of giving scent of victory to the PIA's opponents. If the companies stick to their guns, it may have to think again.</p>

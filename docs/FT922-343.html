			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / People: ECC recruits from Schroders Andrew Teare, who has transformed the fortunes of English China Clays since he took over two years ago, has made the first change to his top management team. He has hired one of his merchant bank advisers, Schroders' Patrick Drayton, to be ECC's new finance director. The appointment is unusual on a couple of counts. The 38-year-old Drayton is not an accountant and is one of a relatively rare breed of corporate financiers who have switched in mid-career to become finance directors of FT-SE 100 companies. Glaxo's John Hignett, a former head of corporate finance at Lazards, is another but he was in his mid-50s when he made the change. Teare is not worried by Drayton's lack of formal accountancy qualifications; he has worked for Schroders for 15 years and has advised ECC for the past five years, so he knows the company well. Noting that most big companies already have well structured accounting and cost control systems, Teare says that he puts a lot of weight on a finance director's ability to 'make the right qualitative judgments'. In recruiting Drayton, Teare believes he has found a finance director who will also be good at 'more fundamental things' such as thinking about how best to finance the business and crafting long-term strategy. Drayton, who joins the company on September 7, is taking over from Robert Carlton-Porter, 47, who has been finance director since 1983, and is leaving to pursue other business interests. Teare says he has no plans to make any other changes to his executive team.</p>

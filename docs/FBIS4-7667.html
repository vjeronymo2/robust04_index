			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, March 31 -- President Lech Walesa has  received President of the National Bank of Poland (NBP) Hanna  Gronkiewicz-Waltz and NBP Vice-President Witold Kozinski to seek  their opinion on the budget bill, the president's press office  said.    Gronkiewicz-Waltz pointed out that the approval of the  budget  would open up an opportunity to negotiate another agreement with  the International Monetary Fund (IMF). She said that the  implementation of the previous agreement brought about the  cancellation of 8 billion dollars owed to the Paris Club and  contributed to a preliminary agreement on cancelling part of  Poland's debt to the London Club.    She stressed that the signing of the agreement increased  Poland's credibility in the international arena, reduced the  level of Polish risk, created chances for the greater inflow of  investment funds to Poland and made it possible to get another  loan from the European Union (EU).    The president voiced its concern over lack of implementation  of promises made during the election campaign by the present  political alignment. Walesa said this was the problem making  the president to be very cautious when making difficult decision  concerning the budget.</p>

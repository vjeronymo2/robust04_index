			<p>CSO     [Text] Isuzu Motors is increasing production of diesel  engines. The small engine "4J" for China and Thailand that is  being produced at the Fujisawa plant (Fujisawa city) will be  boosted in May from the current 20,000 units a month to 30,000  units. The company is starting process production of the  midsized engine "4H" at the Tochigi plant (Ohira Machi)  beginning this spring. They are increasing engine production  capability and preparing to expand overseas business and make  full-scale the engine supply business to other companies at home.    The "4J" is a small engine with a displacement of 3100 cc  that is carried in small trucks with a load capacity of 1.5 to 2  tons. The increased production portion chiefly will be exported  to the China joint venture, Jiangling 50 Ling Qiche Limited  Corp. (Jiangxi Province) and the Thai joint-venture company,  Isuzu Engine Manufacturing Company, Thailand (Bangkok). Truck  sales have greatly increased in both countries and they are  handling it by increasing engine exports from Japan.    The Tochigi plant previously had been in charge of machine  processing of engine parts, but starting this spring, it will  begin production of the medium engine "4H" with a 4300-cc to  4800-cc displacement that is carried in the midsized to small  truck "Elf." They are producing the engine with a monthly  production of 5,000 units in order to begin supply of the engine  to Mazda this summer.    Isuzu will begin OEM [original equipment manufacturer]  supply  of the Elf to Nissan Motor and Nissan Diesel Motor beginning in  the summer of 1995. For this reason, prospects are that they  will further increase production of the "4H" at the Tochigi  plant in the future.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has instructed the IDF  [Israel Defense Forces] to draft contingency plans for possible  violations of the agreement with the PLO, Deputy Chief of Staff  Amnon Shahaq told the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense  Committee. He added that 3,200 Palestinian policemen have so far  arrived in Gaza and Jericho, some of them from Sudan and Iraq.  Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] is not taking part in and  is not cooperating with the Palestinian police, he said.    Our correspondent Hayim Hecht reports that Major General  Shahaq briefed the committee about the investigation of Mustafa  al-Dirani, a member of Hizballah in Lebanon, and noted he is a  tough nut to crack. The deputy chief of staff assessed that  al-Dirani's interrogation will yet continue for a long time.</p>

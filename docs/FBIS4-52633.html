			<p>CSO     [Text] The people want the government to be more  transparent in explaining succession processes and procedures,  especially regarding 1998, so that the succession that is to  take place will be truly constitutional and in accordance with  the overall expectations of the people. Therefore, the  legislative branch is asked to give immediate attention to  regulations on general elections and the MPR [People's  Consultative Assembly] SU [General Session], including the  succession issue.    Prof. Dawam Rahardjo said this Friday, 25 March, in Jakarta  in reply to a KOMPAS question. Meanwhile, Dr. Albert Hasibuan,  member of the DPR [Parliament] from the FKP [Functional Group  Faction], said in a separate interview that the mention of the  succession issue by the chief of state is a sign that the issue  needs to be discussed extensively. "This clearly was an effort  by the chief of state to raise the political maturity of the  Indonesian people," said Albert Hasibuan.    Dawam Rahardjo is of the opinion that several matters  actually are hidden behind the expanding issue of succession.  First, there is the question of certainty as to whether Pak  Harto [President Suharto] will be prepared to be president or  not. If not, he said, there is the possibility of many political  statements before the next MPR SU.    Second, Dawam continued, is the succession process itself.  Until now, this matter has appeared quite closed, such as, for  example, with regard to presidential nominations. In the future,  this matter must be made more transparent, so that people will  know exactly whether a presidential candidate may campaign.    "Up to now, what has happened has not been clear. Several  days after the MPR SU, a presidential candidate emerges. Is that  good for our country? Such a method implies that the presidency  is decided only by certain groups. Although the MPR makes the  decision, the people should participate in giving views on the  candidates," Dawam said emphatically.  <H5>  President's Statement </H5>   Touching on the president's recent explanations of  succession, which he gave seven times, both Dawam and Albert  Hasibuan felt it was a positive matter. The explanations were a  sign from the chief of state that the time has come to discuss  succession extensively and also an indication from the chief of  state that he wants to increase the political maturity of the  Indonesian people.    According to Hasibuan, open discussion of the succession  issue is an indication that democracy is developing, because one  of the essences of democracy is freedom of discussion and  expression of opinion, including discussion of political  succession.    Hasibuan sees the chief of state's statements on succession  as not only an indication of political maturity and the  existence of a democratic process, but also an effort to prevent  the political unrest that usually occurs in some countries when  political succession takes place. "I view the statements as a  lesson from history, which often depicts political succession as  accompanied by unrest," he said.    Nevertheless, Dawam felt the president's repeated statements  still did not appear very clear, because it turns out that they  have been interpreted in various ways. Dawam feels that there  are specific intentions behind the expanding discussion of  succession. "There are those who want the next president to be a  new person. Thus, there appears in these developments a desire  to conduct a process of regeneration," Dawam explained.    In connection with that, he continued, in order to face the  new era the government should ensure that people begin to speak.  If there are discussions on succession, the government should  provide direction so that they are carried on in even greater  detail. They should not be as in the past, when discussions were  general and felt to be unclear. Many people still do not speak  frankly. "The point is, there must be transparency," he asserted.  <H5>  No Taboos </H5>   In this context, Hasibuan said, a discussion of succession  requires that objectivity and rationality be important matters  in political life. This means that all political arguments,  deliberations, and interpretations must be based on principles  of rationality and objectivity. The element of rationality,  based on Pancasila [ideology of the Indonesian state] and the  1945 Constitution, must be developed.    With this in mind, Hasibuan said, there are automatically no  political areas that are sacred or taboo. Therefore, succession  needs to be discussed. "Although it may have been taboo in the  past, it is not taboo now and needs to be discussed," he said.    Hasibuan said further that discussion of succession must be  oriented toward creation of political stability. "Thus, we  cannot make talk of discussion taboo," he said. This means that  a rational and objective discussion of succession encourages the  view that leaders may come and go, but institutions continue.  "That is political succession. Leaders come and go because of  succession, but institutions continue," he said.    Rational and objective political succession, Hasibuan said,  encourages the choice of leaders when it is time. "We will  discuss the criteria for leadership. 'The right leader, at the  right place, at the right time.' Our rationale will be to select  the one who is suited to be a leader," he said.    A similar thought was expressed by Dawam, who feels that in  the future the people expect improvements in succession  processes and procedures, including the preparation of cadres.    "A candidate should not be prepared by only one group, which  also may be a small one. That is not what the people want. The  people want a much more extensive process of political  participation," Dawam asserted.  <H5>  Political Culture </H5>   Meanwhile, Hotman M. Siahaan, lecturer at the Sociology and  Political Science Faculty of Airlangga University, Surabaya,  told KOMPAS that sociopolitical organizations need to anticipate  the succession issue by improving the political culture, because  the operation of the constitutional mechanism of succession will  be much affected by the objective conditions of the political  culture.    If succession is expected to be democratic, efforts to renew  the political culture must begin now, so that when the moment of  succession comes, the democratic foundation will be strong.  According to Hotman, a tradition of democracy and openness and a  rational, objective attitude in political life do not yet have  strong roots in the political culture in Indonesia. Remnants of  feudal and aristocratic culture and of thinking based on  primordial emotions still strongly color the political culture  in Indonesia.    The result is, when the succession issue--which basically is  an essential and strategic matter in the life of a nation and  state--emerges, it is considered strange and frightening.    In this context, Hotman said, beginning now it is the  responsibility of the sociopolitical organizations to begin  developing cultural aspects: how to select the people and how  the mechanism can be operated honestly, objectively, and openly.</p>

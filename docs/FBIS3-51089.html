Reacting to the U.S. President's latest statements reported by  THE NEW YORK TIMES on 6 January, Professor Hubert De Ronceray  congratulates himself on the fact that the State Department  could finally admit to President Aristide's psychological  instability. In any case, the MDN leader requires a type of  relations more in conformity with the requirements of the  international community's new world economic order.    [Begin De Ronceray recording] The MDN deems President  Clinton's decision to reconsider the Haitian file, in light of  facts accumulated over the past two years, realistic and  encouraging. The U.S. Administration's open-mindedness must  correspond with Haiti's political willingness in order to manage  and harmonize the requirements of national reconciliation with  the new international power struggles. In this respect, the  Haitian people consider themselves entitled to expect from the  United Nations, the OAS, and the four countries called the  Friends of Haiti a type of relations more concerned with  effective solidarity and more in conformity with the  requirements of a new international economic order.    MDN invites the UN Security Council, the OAS, Venezuela,  France, and Canada to commit themselves, alongside President  Clinton, to the definitive closing of the Aristide file which is  too heavy with incoherence, violence, destruction, human rights  violations, and calls for foreign military invasion.

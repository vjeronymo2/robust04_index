Koreans Protest Agricultural Market Opening" -- </F> KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, February 2 (KCNA) -- More than 20,000  farmers and students of South Korea held a peasants' rally  against the anti-national agricultural market opening by the Kim  Yong-sam traitorous group at university quarters in Seoul on  February 1, according to radio reports from Seoul.    Sponsored by nine peasants' organisations including the  National Federation of Peasants Associations (Chonnong), the  ralliers denounced with bitter indignation the treacherous crime  of the Kim Yong-sam puppet regime in selling off the markets of  rice and other agricultural products to the United States.    In the resolution adopted at the rally, they said if the  agricultural market is opened, the South Korean agriculture will  go totally bankrupt and urged the authorities to put the market  opening issue to a referendum. And they demanded that the  "National Assembly" refuse to "ratify" the treacherous  agricultural market opening.    At the end of the rally, they went over to a demonstration,  loudly shouting "oppose agricultural market opening " and  marched toward the U.S. Embassy, clashing with a large police  force.    While the demonstrators and police were engaged in a seasaw  battle, some 500 students of the demonstrators marched toward  "Chongwadae" [presidential offices].    Synchronising with this protest in Seoul, as many as 200  peasants of the North Cholla provincial branch of Chonnong  headed for Seoul to join in it, while staging a demonstration on  the Seoul-Pusan express highway.    Yi Ki-taek, chairman of the opposition Democratic Party,  called upon politicians and people to join hands in the struggle  against agricultural market opening.</p>

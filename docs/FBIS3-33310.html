Mamedov, who arrived in  Panama on Monday for an official three-day visit, told the press  the Cuban Government's decision to invite the opposition to a  political dialogue was "very correct."    Mamedov, who, today, signed an agreement of understanding  and  political consultation with Panamanian Foreign Minister Jose  Mulino, said: "Russia can be very helpful in solving Cuba's  problems."    Mulino told reporters that Panama "looks favorably on" the  position of the Cuban Government, which recently invited  approximately 80 groups of exiled Cubans to a meeting to be held  in Havana by late April. "We hope all involved parties can  attend and the Cubans can attain a Cuban-style solution," he  said.</p>

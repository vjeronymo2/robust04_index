			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Ren Ren: "BOC To Lend More Working Capital to Foreign </F> Firms"]    [Text] The Bank of China, the country's major foreign  exchange bank, concentrated on lending working capital to  foreign-funded ventures in the first quarter of this year to  ensure their smooth operation.    From January through March, the bank's working capital loans  in hard currency to foreign-funded firms accounted for 85 per  cent of the bank's total foreign exchange credits to such firms  in the first quarter.    Meanwhile, 99.6 percent of the bank's total loans in  renminibi to foreign-funded firms are working capital credits,  said an official with the bank, who declined to be identified.    In accordance with the State's policy of curbing the  over-expansion of capital spending, the bank will keep strict  control over lending for investment in fixed assets.    In the first quarter, the fixed-assets loans for  foreign-funded ventures dipped slightly compared with the same  period of last year, he said.    The official declined to give more details about the exact  sizes of the working capital credits and the exact decline rate  in the fixed-assets loans.    The official stressed that his bank will give full support  to  foreign-funded ventures.    He said more loans are expected to be granted in the second  quarter than in the first and predicted that the amount lent to  foreign-funded ventures this year will be more than last year.    But the rate of growth will not be too big, the official  said, since the State will maintain its controls on credit in  the face of soaring prices.    The bank last year supplied $4.3 billion worth of foreign  exchange loans to foreign-funded ventures, 28 per cent more than  in 1992.    As a major channel for foreign investment, the Bank of China  has followed a credit policy that favours foreign-funded  ventures. Since 1980, it has provided foreign-funded ventures  with $18.3 billion in foreign exchange and 135.6 billion yuan  $15.5 billion) in renminbi.    About half of all foreign-funded ventures in China have  opened accounts with the bank, and a fifth of them have been  granted loans.    Since the demand for loans is much higher than the bank's  capacity, the official said, the bank will direct most of its  limited capital into selected firms according to national  industrial policy.    Most of the enterprises on the bank's preferred list are in  energy, transportation and telecommunications.    Those with high profitability and credit worthiness will  also  be given priority.    While converting itself from being a State specialized bank  to commercial operations, Guan said, the Bank of China will pay  more attention to the efficiency of its loans.    "We will enhance the anti-risk sense to protect our bank's  assets," he said.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["(li)"-signed report: "The President Wants To Maintain </F> Closer Contacts With the Government"]    [Text] Prague -- President Vaclav Havel wants to stay in  more frequent working contact with the government and,  therefore, he will attend more of its meetings. "I have come to  the conclusion that it will be useful for the two sides if I  change slightly the method of my contacts with the government as  a whole, with the individual ministers, and with the prime  minister. I think that it is in the interest of our state's  stability for these contacts to be matter- of-fact and  frequent," said the president as he was leaving yesterday's  cabinet session, which he attended for about 70 minutes.    The government expressed its agreement yesterday with the  president's visit to Slovakia, which is scheduled for 26 May.  "The government did not give me any tasks, but, of course, I  will receive background materials from the Foreign Ministry as I  do for all my foreign visits," said Havel in connection with his  visit to Slovakia.    The government also agreed with the president's  participation  in the celebrations to be held at the beginning of June to mark  the 50th anniversary of the allied landings in France.</p>

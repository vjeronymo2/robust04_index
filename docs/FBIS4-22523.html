			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Ivanovich Im, Moscow representative of </F> the "Tuymaada Diamond" Joint-Stock Company: "The `Tuymaada  Diamond' AK [Joint-Stock Company]: A Pioneer in the Russian  Diamond Market"]    [Text] It is still too soon to assess the  significance of the appearance in the Russian diamond industry  of a large new center of the diamond-cutting industry in the  Republic of Sakha (Yakutia). The production of brilliants here  has not yet emerged from the formative stage. But it is  important that it is being developed under market conditions,  paving the way toward development of a Russian diamond market  and actively contributing to an upswing in the economy of the  Republic of Sakha (Yakutia). The "Tuymaada Diamond" Joint-Stock  Company has assumed the principal burden of resolving the  problems associated with the establishment of cutting  plants.    Aleksandr Ivanovich Im, the company's Moscow  representative, tells us about the company's activity and its  problems and prospects. His work is typical of specialists in  this new sector in the republic's national economy who have come  from other fields of activity and are enthusiastic supporters of  diamond industry development. Aleksandr Ivanovich was born in  the village of Suntar in the Yakut ASSR in 1957. In 1984, he  graduated from the mechanical design faculty of the MVTU [Moscow  Higher Technical School] imeni Bauman, after which he worked for  9 years at the Central Aerohydrodynamics Institute (TsAGI) imeni  N. Ye. Zhukovskiy. Because of economic circumstances he was  discharged in 1993 and became an adviser to the torgpred [trade  representative] of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia). He has  worked in the "Tuymaada Diamond" AK since September 1993.    "What does the name of the company mean?" Familiarity with  it  usually begins with a question such as this. Tuymaada is the  name of the valley where Yakutsk, the capital of the Republic of  Sakha (Yakutia), is situated. This is where our company, which  marks its 3d aniversary on 20 March 1994, is located. We can say  with every right today that its establishment marked the  formation of a new center of the Russian diamond-cutting  industry, as well as a new diamond-processing sector in the  republic's national economy.    The organization of such a company by a group of young  persons with initiative was effectively supported by our  government in the spring of 1991. And this is understandable,  because the republic received the right to dispose of 100  percent of the technical diamonds extracted in it and 20 percent  of the jewelry-quality diamonds.    The company was initially formed as partly a state  enterprise  in order to realize the state program for development of the  diamond-processing industry of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia).  "Tuymaada Diamond" is an open-type joint-stock company. The  charter capital of the company has grown from 10 million rubles  [R] to R1.8371 billion. Altogether, 49,898 shares of stock have  been issued; 31.63 percent of them belong to the Republic of  Sakha (Yakutia), 22.53 percent belong to the gosimushchestvo  [State Property] Management Fund, 5.45 percent belong to the  Fund for Public Social Support, and 3.65 percent belong to the  Labor and Employment Committee.    The largest stockholders, with representatives on the board  of directors, include companies such as the "Almazy Rossii  Sakha" AK (14.85 percent of the shares), the "Zoloto Yakutii"  APK (6.8 percent), The Altay "Kristall" Production Association  (5.74 percent), the "Aldanzoloto" AO [Joint-Stock Comapny] (5.21  percent), and the "Sakhainvest" Checking Investment Fund (1.67  percent). Altogether, these stockholders hold 34.27 percent of  the shares. And finally, 34.1 percent of the shares are held by  other stockholders, each of whom owns less than 1 percent of the  company stock.    As we see, the "Tuymaada Diamond" AK functions with  participation not only by Yakut enterprises, but other Russian  enterprises as well. I also emphasize that although diamond  processing is an export-oriented sector and entry into the world  market is in the company's plans, it is now operating in the  Russian domestic market and selling its output to CIS countries  as well.    Successful operation of diamond-cutting plants depends not  only on a reliable source of good uncut diamonds, but  experienced, skilled personnel. Their skill is developed over  the years and is passed on from generation to generation. For  this reason, the training of workers and specialists has been a  fundamental labor problem for us. We have managed to resolve  it--young people have been sent to learn at Russian and  Ukrainian enterprises and foreign enterprises. We have also  invited specialists from other localities. The first diamond was  cut in 1992, and this first of our own brilliants, which we  obtained in the village of Suntar, was of quite high quality and  created a real wave of enthusiasm, reinforced confidence in the  practicality of our plans, and prompted the rayon  administrations to provide us with assistance in every possible  way. The local administrations made their contribution to our  company in the form of stone buildings that were available,  which speeded up the process of establishing the plants  considerably.    Altogether, 16 diamond-cutting plants are to be built in the  1993-1995 period in accordance with the state program. Six  plants--40 percent--have already been put into operation, and  all the rest are scheduled to be commissioned from April to  August this year. That is, the program will be fulfilled ahead  of schedule. The Suntar, Yakutsk, Churapchinskiy,  Verkhnevilyuyskiy, Berdigestyakhskiy, and Namskiy  diamond-cutting plants are now in operation. They are all  provided with the most advanced Russian and foreign equipment.  Equipment valued at R1.6 billion has been delivered and  installed. Two enterprises have also been built to turn out  diamond powders and tools and to produce items made of uncut  gemstones. Transport and commercial firms have been formed. A  controlling block of stock in the "Eyge" Bank has been obtained.  So an entire range of structures has been established to ensure  the stability of our diamond-processing sector. The company's  plans include the establishment of jewelry enterprises which  make extensive use of our product in their work.    The result of our 3 years of work has been the formation of  a  system of joint-stock companies [AO], joint ventures, and the  joint-stock companies [AK] associated with them. The "Amma  Diamond," "Lena Diamond," "Sargy Diamond," "Mayya Diamond,"  "Vostok Diamond," "Ensieli Diamond," and "Kebeey Diamond"  joint-stock companies and the "Sakha Japan Diamond," "Amma  Padani Diamonds," "Kuoliti Diamonds," "Ensieli Diam," and  "Tuymaada Raykhbard Diamond Ltd" joint ventures are engaged in  diamond cutting. The "Kyundyu Tass" Joint-Stock Company is  producing items made of gemstones and the "Sakha Diamond"  Joint-Stock Company is turning out diamond powders and tools.    In looking back at what has been achieved, we see the  creation of prestigious modern work places in the republic as  one of the important results. Nearly 900 persons are working in  the company structures, including over 170 engineers and  technicians and more than 700 workers, of whom 463 are cutters.  Another 165 persons are in training. We are especially proud of  this result, inasmuch as our cutting plants have been dispersed  in agricultural uluses [settlements], which not only helps to  resolve the problem of employment for the rural population, but  has a beneficial effect on the entire local economy. There is a  real possibility of shifting the uluses from republic budget  subsidies to funds which they have earned themselves. But after  all, according to the statistics, all the uluses depend on the  subsidies for 95 percent of their support, which inevitably  reinforces parasitical attitudes and social apathy. But now  attractive types of employment have been developed for the  residents. In addition, the funds going to the republic budget  from the production and sale of brilliants make it possible to  improve the financing of many public health, education, and  cultural facilities.    But while the social importance of the diamond-processing  industry in the Republic of Sakha is quite apparent, the  economic effectiveness is questionable at times. How  economically feasible is the construction of cutting enterprises  in remote, frosty Siberia, and in the villages as well? Will  they be profitable? Yes, they will be. And our economic  calculations have already been confirmed by experience. So what  is increasing the expenditures? The lack of roads and long  distances are leading to increased transportation expenses. The  freezing weather increases the expenses for heat and  electricity. And northern residents must be paid much more for  their work than the residents of Russia's central regions.    All the same, the value of diamonds is so high that the  expenditures for transportation, heat and electricity, and wages  have a relatively small effect on the value of brilliants. On  average, 85 percent of the value of a brilliant is in the value  of the uncut diamond, and nearly 10 percent of the value is in  the wages. The other expenses for manufacturing and sales,  leasing of premises, heat and electricity, and transportation  account for no more than 5 percent of the value. And while all  these expenses under the conditions in our republic are three  times higher when compared with the West, for example, the value  of a brilliant with the wages paid there is increased by only 5  to 10 percent. But this makes it possible with good work  organization, modern equipment, and the cutters' high skill to  count on the competitiveness of Yakut brilliants not only in the  Russian domestic market, but the world market as well. For  example, our wages cannot be compared with wages in the West at  present, and in addition, we do not pay the high rent that they  must pay, which enables us even now to speak about the lower  production cost of our product.    Of course, the industrial processing of diamonds should be  in  complete conformity with the standards recognized by the world  cutting centers and should take rapidly changing market  conditions into account. And while all these years the  specialists of the "Tuymaada Diamond" AK lived continuously in  an investment routine and were preoccupied by the problems of  financial resources and construction, we have now come really  close to a new stage in our development, when the quality of the  brilliants and their conformity to market demands are assuming  decisive importance.    World experience shows that a cutter approaches the peak of  his skill in 5 years, spasmodically raising labor productivity:  three to five times as much each year for the first 3 years, and  two to three times as much in the last time period. Today the  production cost of cutting brilliants in the republic's cutting  plants is very high because of low productivity. But this  situation will gradually change, gross output will increase, and  expenses will begin declining. And our task is to react in a  timely manner to the change in "style" in the cut diamond  business and requirements of the jewelry industry.    The fact that our plants have 30 to 50 cutters, as a rule,  and are not giants by any means helps us in coping with this  problem; they can be restructured and improve their technology  easily. We are guided in our development by the achievements and  traditions of the Russian diamond-cutting school, whose  authority is quite reliable. All the same, the classical  "Russian-cut" brilliants from the traditionally high-grade uncut  diamonds in the world markets are being squeezed by brilliants  which may have a less complex but very diversified cut. Two of  the six cutting plants already in operation are using the same  technology which is used at other Russian plants, but four of  them are using a different technology--Belgian, Japanese, or  Israeli. In addition, the company includes joint ventures with  Japanese, Belgian, and Israeli firms, which facilitates the  assimilation of new organizational and technological principles  in the work. The new technologies are also attactive because  they increase the output of a finished product from uncut  diamonds and reduce the cost of brilliants.    And returning again to achievements in the 3 years of  development at the "Tuymaada Diamond" AK, I would like to stress  the following conclusion of fundaamental importance: our company  has been practically a pioneer in the world cut diamond market.    A Russian domestic market for cut diamonds, with all the  structures needed for this, still remains to be developed.  Joint-stock companies for processing diamonds in the Republic of  Sakha (Yakutia) were practically the first to take this path by  selling brilliants to jewelry plants, firms, repair shops,  commercial banks, and individual citizens. Other Russian cutting  plants left after the collapse of the USSR with which we were  actively collaborating inherited a cumbersome production  facility without developed commercial structures and a rigid  framework of technical conditions. On the other hand, these  plants have SPTU [presumably: agricultural vocational-technical  schools] with established traditions in training specialists and  developed machine building. I think that although we have  different tasks and we are in various stages of development, we  have more common interests than differences.    In selling brilliants, we are establishing a market for them  in Russia at a time when the quality of brilliants as a fine  investment commodity has begun to appreciate considerably under  the conditions of high inflation. In the world market, the value  of cut diamonds increases by an average 300 percent over a  10-year period. So brilliants are a commodity which yields an  average profit on investment of 30 percent annually, and often  even more, since the price for brilliants is highly individual  and depends on numerous parameters. A brilliant is always a  brilliant. The merits of a brilliant need not be advertised and  its profitability need not be demonstrated. A brilliant that is  purchased requires practically no special care from its owner,  and it just rises in price. Especially as the level of prices  for brilliants in the domestic market has turned out to be  unexpectedly productive--in wholesale batches it is higher than  prices in the world market. This makes it possible for the  "Tuymaada Diamond" AK to allow a discount of up to 10 percent  from the prices of wholesale batches in sales to its  stockholders. Moreover, we guarantee that we will buy back the  brilliants if stockholders are in urgent need of funds.    Can you become a stockholder in our company? Yes, you can.  We  are beginning the sixth stock issue and we are counting on  investments. In previous years only about 5 percent of the  company's shares were distributed in the Russian market as a  whole, but 95 percent were distributed within the republic. Now  the "Tuymaada Diamond" AK intends to increase the sale of stock  shares in the Russian national market. They are in good demand,  and the price in the Moscow stock exchanges is 9 to 13 times  their nominal value. The next emission will reflect the results  of reassessment of the fixed capital, and each ruble of the  stock's value will be reinforced by real physical assets. We are  confident that this stock issue will be bought up quickly by  those who are able to assess the commercial attractiveness of  stock shares from the diamond business.    In entering the market environment, we became aware of the  practically complete lack of needed information in the country  on the prices for uncut diamonds and brilliants in the world  markets in one region or another. There are not enough studies  and forecasts of market conditions. The instability of export  duties is a big obstacle. We would also like parliament and the  government to expedite establishment of the necessary legal and  normative basis for normal operation of the diamond-processing  industry under market conditions.  <H8>  * * * </H8>   Tuymaada Diamond    Our address: 677000, City of  Yakutsk, Russia.

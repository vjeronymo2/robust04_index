			<p><P> July 18, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SALE OF PIONEER S&amp;L TO DEVELOPER WERTIN IS DEAD, STATE AGENCY REPORTS  </P> <P> The proposed sale of Pioneer Savings &amp; Loan in Newport Beach to Irvine  developer John E. Wertin has died.  </P> <P> Wertin, who bought a recovering Bank of San Clemente in late 1987, had been  negotiating for the purchase of Pioneer since September. He gave up on July 3,  according to a recent notice from the state Department of Savings and Loan.  </P> <P> Neither Wertin nor James F. Deane, Pioneer's chairman, could be reached to  explain why the deal fell through.  </P> <P> Pioneer, which hasn't had a profitable year since it opened in 1985, has seen  its initial capital outlay of $2 million dwindle to $572,000 by the end of  March. The S&amp;L's assets have similarly dropped to $15.1 million from a high  of $22.2 million in December, 1986.  </P> <P> Wertin's $1.5-million cash deal would have helped to end a bitter dispute over  ownership of the S&amp;L. Two years ago, the Hammond Co., a Newport Beach  mortgage-banking operation, scuttled a tentative $2-million deal to buy Pioneer  because of uncertainty over who owned the S&amp;L.  </P> <P> Gerry Findley, a financial-institutions consultants in Brea, said the sale of  Pioneer is hampered by a general uncertainty about the tattered S&amp;L  industry. Congress is working on an S&amp;L rescue bill that would drastically  increase requirements for capital -- an institution's final reserve against  losses -- and would subject S&amp;Ls to examinations by banking regulators.  </P> <P> "The way the regulations are coming down is not going to make the thrift  business profitable to be in," Findley said.  </P> <P> Such flagging interest in the thrift business, along with Pioneer's ownership  problems, doesn't make Pioneer an attractive purchase, he said.  </P> <P> Originally, eight investors were going to open Pioneer, according to a pending  Orange County Superior Court lawsuit. Instead, the group decided to loan $1.8  million to Deane in a complicated financing arrangement that allowed Deane to  hold all the shares as sole owner.  </P> <P> But by June, 1986, state and federal regulators saw that the $1.8 million  wasn't being repaid and decided that Pioneer was, in fact, owned by eight  individuals. The regulators required the other seven individuals to reveal  their interests and to seek state approval to become S&amp;L owners.  </P> <P> Instead, six of the seven other investors withdrew their applications for  approval and, eight months later, sued Deane and the lawyers who arranged the  original deal. The suit seeks to rescind the contract, alleging fraud.  </P></p>

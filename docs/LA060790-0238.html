			<p><P> June 7, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> MICHENER PLEADS WITH VANDALS  </P> <P> James Michener wrote a plea to three young men who pleaded guilty to  anti-Semitic vandalism: "Get off that doomed train right now."  </P> <P> A judge had given the men an unusual sentence: learn about the Nazi Holocaust.  </P> <P> Part of the assignment was to read a chapter from the author's book "Poland" on  a concentration camp.  </P> <P> After learning of the sentence, Michener wrote to the men through the judge,  John Carey, who said Wednesday he was moved by the author's interest.  </P> <P> "Fellows, what you're doing is wrong," Michener wrote. "You will stain  yourselves if you follow that route. Get off that doomed train right now."  </P> <P> Michael Morano, 18; Michael Venturino, 18, and Neville Anthony Mason, 20,  pleaded guilty to defacing a high school a year ago.  </P></p>

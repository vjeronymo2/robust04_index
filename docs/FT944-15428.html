			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Spotlight falls on BAe The spotlight in the VSEL takeover saga swung away from the submarine maker yesterday, to beam full square on British Aerospace following weekend press reports that BAe might itself end up the victim of GEC's huge cash balances. BAe, which has an agreed offer for VSEL on the table, surged 28 to 498p in turnover of 5.9m, at which level its market capitalisation is around Pounds 1.87bn. At the last count GEC was known to be sitting on cash funds of some Pounds 3bn. GEC, which last week declared itself as a potential counter-bidder for VSEL, is widely understood to have held talks last year aimed at merging its defence business with that of BAe. GEC opted to play its cards close to its chest yesterday, putting out a firm no comment statement. The shares rose 2 to 295p in turnover which at 3.1m suggested that the rumour mill was not having too great an effect on activity. VSEL dipped 5 to 1320p following half-year results which included an increased interim dividend and a declaration that September cash balances stood at Pounds 364m.</p>

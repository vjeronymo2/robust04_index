			<p><P> July 17, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWS ANALYSIS;  </P> <P> THE RUSH TO GERMAN UNITY PROVES UNSTOPPABLE  </P> <P> President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's agreement Monday to accept a reunified Germany  in the Western alliance is the latest and most dramatic example of the power of  the idea of German unity.  </P> <P> Since Hungarian Foreign Minister Gyula Horn first opened the Iron Curtain last  September and East Germans began pouring West, it is an idea that has pushed  aside all in its way.  </P> <P> When West German Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl insisted one morning last  February that a German currency union would take years, it required less than  24 hours for him to bow to the political realities -- and only a few short  months to implement that very currency union.  </P> <P> Worries about the power of a united Germany, most visible in the West among the  French class politique and followers of British Prime Minister Margaret  Thatcher, were swept aside in the rush to endorse the idea at a European  Community summit last April.  </P> <P> In Germany itself, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's talk last November of a loose  German confederation leading to eventual unification had by March become a call  for all-German elections by the end of 1991. And these, by the end of last  month, had been advanced to Dec. 2, 1990.  </P> <P> When the Parliament elected then holds its first session, Germany will  effectively be one.  </P> <P> On Monday, Gorbachev became the latest to jump aside rather than be run over in  the headlong rush, giving Moscow's blessing to what a year ago would have been  inconceivable: a united Germany as a full, integrated member of the Atlantic  Alliance.  </P> <P> For some, it was as if an electric charge had cut the stuffy summer air in this  Caucasus spa town as Kohl sat next to his host and calmly went down the list of  Soviet concessions: NATO membership for a united Germany; withdrawal of Soviet  forces in a relatively short period from what is now East Germany, while Allied  troops stay in Berlin; a quick wrap-up of the rights of the World War II  victorious powers in Germany, including those of the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> Despite the euphoria on the official Luftwaffe Boeing 707 winging its way  homeward to Bonn, Monday's agreement was far from a one-sided affair.  </P> <P> Gorbachev won a commitment from Kohl to limit the size of a future German  military to 370,000 personnel, roughly one-tenth the Soviet Union's troop  strength, and renounce nuclear, chemical and biological weapons.  </P> <P> "This can't be of disadvantage to the Soviet Union," Gorbachev noted.  </P> <P> It is possible to argue that if anything, the accord on balance actually  enhances Soviet security in the long term. Some analysts say the withdrawal of  Soviet forces from East Germany will make little difference to Soviet security.  Certainly, growing tension between newly democratic East Germans and Soviet  forces stationed there makes Moscow's continued military presence in the region  a questionable asset.  </P> <P> If the terms agreed to by the two leaders become reality -- and initial praise  from President Bush and some other Western leaders indicate there will be  little opposition -- they will help outline the shape of a future European  security order.  </P> <P> While it will be an order in which Moscow's biggest single military contingent  at present outside of its borders will eventualy disappear back into the Soviet  Union, it is also an order in which a future united Germany is committed to a  modest army.  </P> <P> It has the earmarks of a formula that reassures Moscow yet allows the two  Germanys to continue their race toward elections.  </P> <P> After the news conference announcing the agreement, reporters filing out onto a  patio spotted West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher and his  Soviet counterpart, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, sitting together on a two-seater  garden swing sipping mineral water.  </P> <P> Both were smiling.  </P></p>

			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Kleinwort European at small premium Shares in the Kleinwort European Privatisation Investment Trust, which was Pounds 380m oversubscribed in its public offer last week, in effect went to a small premium in the first day's trading yesterday. The shares were issued part paid at 50p, with one warrant attached to every five shares. The shares closed yesterday at 43 1/2 p, and the warrants traded separately at 43p, giving a package price for a share and a fifth of a warrant of about 52p, a premium of 4 per cent. Kleinwort said this was 'encouraging', but in line with expectations. Smith New Court said trading in the shares had been heavy, with volume of 58m, plus 8.7m in the warrants. A total of 500m shares have been issued in the trust, which was the largest UK investment trust launch on record. Kleinworts would not comment how much of the initial amount raised had been invested so far, but said that purchases were on target. The trust will invest in companies privatised within the last five years, in the UK as well as the rest of Europe, in addition to taking advantage of new privatisations as they crop up. The partly-paid structure was intended to allow gradual investment of the fund.</p>

			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / US warns Saddam of 'horrendous' price for war: Kuwait sends troops to Iraqi border - 2,000 marines arrive in Gulf The US stepped up deployment of a 'formidable force' of troops, warships and jets in the Gulf yesterday and warned Iraq it would pay an 'horrendous price' if President Saddam Hussein ordered an invasion of Kuwait. The warning, from Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, came as thousands of Iraqi troops continued to mass near Kuwait's border. In Kuwait City, residents formed queues at petrol stations, stocked up with water and bought extra supplies from supermarkets. Banks reported unusually heavy demand for dollars. Kuwait has called up reservists and sent some 20,000 men - thought to be its entire army - near its border with Iraq, and moved up 50 tanks. Mr William Perry, US defence secretary, said 'many squadrons' of F-15, F-16 and A-10 jets together with Awacs early-warning aircraft were being sent to the region. By late yesterday, 2,000 ship-borne marines had arrived in the Gulf and 4,000 more troops were due to arrive in Kuwait to operate tanks and armoured personnel carriers positioned there after the 1991 Gulf war. Another 18,000 marines would begin moving to the region within days and about 14,000 infantry troops were also expected to be sent, a US defence offical said. In addition, warships armed with Tomahawk cruise missiles were on their way to the Gulf and the Red Sea. Mr Christopher, in Jerusalem on the first leg of a Middle East peace shuttle, said that Mr Saddam would be subjecting Iraq to 'devastation' if his forces crossed into Kuwait. 'We're moving a lot of forces in there at the present time. It will be some time, I think, before his forces are ready and we're in a very strong deterrent mode.' Mr Christopher said he would visit Kuwait during his week-long tour of the region. The US show of strength came amid reports that Iraq was deploying as many as 14,000 more troops and support armour towards the Kuwaiti border. US officials said a 64,000-strong Iraqi force would soon be in place. Mr Hamed Youssef Hammadi, Iraq's information minister, confirmed on Radio Monte Carlo that Iraqi troops were within 20km of the Kuwaiti border - just 5km north of the demilitarised zone straddling the border and policed by the lightly-armed United Nations Iraq-Kuwait Observer Mission. However, Iraq's intentions in massing troops north of Kuwait were no clearer yesterday, although the state-run Baghdad Radio repeated threats that Iraq would take unspecified 'measures' if the UN Security Council did not take immediate steps to ease the four-year-old embargo on oil exports, which has devastated the country's economy. The commentary said Iraq had the 'right to take any measures' to defend itself in the face of what it called 'an injustice of unprecedented proportions' being inflicted by the UN, the US and Gulf neighbours. Iraq appears to be attempting to force the hand of the Security Council which will this week consider a report from Mr Rolf Ekeus, the UN envoy, that comprehensive systems to monitor Iraq's chemical, nuclear, biological and long-range missile manufacturing potential are ready to become operational. Iraqi officials have said that this means they are in compliance with UN Gulf war ceasefire resolutions and sanctions should therefore be eased immediately. Britain and the US have said they oppose setting any definite criteria for lifting sanctions now. The US says Iraq has failed to comply with the bulk of such resolutions and remains a regional threat. Iraq said last night it was hoping for a diplomatic solution to the crisis, and Russia, France and China - all permanent members of the Security Council - were working on this. In Kuwait City, the arrival offshore of a British frigate, HMS Cornwall, provided a visible sign of US and British military support, an operation that officials said would take several days to put fully in place.

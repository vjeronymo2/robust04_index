			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The California program applies to vehicular diesel fuel. Essentially any vehicle with wheels, including construction and farm equipment, is covered. The regulation establishes a 500 ppm sulfur limit as well as a 10 percent cap on aromatics (20 percent for small refiners). Diesel normally has about 30 percent aromatics. California and EPA believe aromatics contribute to the formation of NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and particulate emissions. California includes an equivalency provision which allows refiners to make diesel with more than 10 percent aromatics if engine testing demonstrates equivalent emissions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Most if not all of the large California refiners are pursuing higher-aromatic equivalent fuels. While a few oil companies have received CARB certification for their equivalent fuels, only Chevron has gone public with its formulation at this time. One of Chevron's alternatives has 19 percent aromatics with 200 ppm sulfur and a cetane number of 59. The company estimates that it can manufacture this fuel at an incremental cost of 6&hyph;7 cents per gallon. This is about half the incremental cost to make a strict 10 percent aromatics fuel. California has granted temporary waivers from the requirements provided the refiner pays 6&cent;/gallon into a trust fund. However, prices in California initially jumped far more than 20 cents per gallon and California is in the process of investigating its rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA believes that California's rule is likely to achieve NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions reductions which will not be achieved by the federal program. CARB estimates these reductions will be approximately 4&hyph;7 percent of diesel engine NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . EPA therefore is not proposing any changes to California's diesel fuel regulations. EPA is working with California to help understand the reasons behind the huge price rise, supply, and injector/pump seal problems and will take note of any change to California's rule. The South Coast and Ventura have been using the low-sulfur fuel since 1985 without any problems. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Even if California were to relax its rule, EPA's diesel fuel standards still apply. However, since the FIP takes credit for the California rule which delivers more NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  credits than the federal rule, EPA may have to propose additional FIP reductions if the California rule were to be relaxed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> F. Severe Area Requirements for Sacramento <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Introduction <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As discussed in section III.B.3., EPA is proposing attainment demonstrations for 1999 and 2005 for the Sacramento FIP. If EPA promulgates a 2005 attainment demonstration, the Sacramento area will be reclassified as a severe ozone nonattainment area and become responsible for meeting all applicable deadlines and requirements for SIP purposes, which include the requirements outlined in section III.B.3.e. As part of the alternative proposal for 2005, EPA will address the additional severe area requirements with the following. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Employee Commute Options Program <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> a. Introduction and Statutory Requirements. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In the alternative that EPA bumps up Sacramento to ``Severe'' and establishes a 2005 attainment date, EPA proposes that an Employee Commute Options (ECO) program be included in the FIP package. Because more people are driving than ever before and they are driving longer distances, the ECO provision was included in the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 at section 182(d)(1)(B) (42 U.S.C. 7511a(d)(1)(B)). Currently, increasing numbers of drivers and vehicle miles traveled (VMT) offset a large portion of the emissions reductions achieved through producing and selling vehicles that operate more cleanly. Without limits on increasing vehicle travel, the emissions caused by more vehicles being driven more miles under more congested conditions will outweigh the emissions reduced per vehicle from cleaner fuels and improved emission control technologies. Ultimately, this will result in an overall increase in motor vehicle emissions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

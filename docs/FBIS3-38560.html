			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Italians Say Yes To Intervention"] </F>   [Text] Milan -- More than 50 percent of Italians are in  favor of an armed UN intervention "aimed at ending war in  Bosnia." Within this large slice of the population,  three-fourths are also in favor of the involvement of Italian  troops in a possible UN intervention, whereas only 17 percent --  faced with the possibility of Italian troops being used --  change their minds and say no.    This is the altogether surprising result of a survey  conducted by Doxa on behalf of TG3 [TV news], which broadcast  the results yesterday evening. Fifty-one percent, therefore,  want air raids and a UN intervention to take place. Among the  male population, this percentage rises to 58. The more educated  the interviewees are, the more they like the idea of  intervention. Only 32 percent of Italians are against  intervention, while 17 percent did not express any preferences.</p>

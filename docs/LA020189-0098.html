			<p><P> February 1, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> POLICE REFORMS WILL BE STUDIED  </P> <P> The Long Beach City Council agreed Tuesday to study a proposal by a group of  clergymen who demanded reforms in the Police Department to address allegations  of racism and brutality.  </P> <P> Calling themselves the "Concerned Clergy of Long Beach," more than a dozen  ministers and rabbis asked the council to beef up human relations training for  officers, open a police substation in a minority neighborhood and create a  citizen oversight panel to hear police brutality complaints.  </P> <P> Their demands arise from a Jan. 14 incident in which a white police officer  allegedly cursed at a black man and pushed his head through a plate glass  window during a confrontation. The incident was taped for NBC's "Today Show,"  which was doing a story on an anti-police brutality group that was conducting a  "sting" operation to demonstrate police abuses.  </P></p>

			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / UK schools at bottom of class BRITONS will be the waiters, porters, cleaners and lavatory attendants of Europe unless their schools improve, a leading independent school headmaster warned yesterday. Speaking in Rouen, France, to the Independent Schools Association, Mr Peter Owen, its chairman, called for urgent reforms to stop Britain dropping further behind its continental rivals. 'Who will be the manual workers of the coming decades?' he asked. 'Unless we act positively, it will be the children passing through British schools now.' He said Britain's education system was 'woefully inadequate' for most children, failing to stimulate them or provide adequate qualifications. Mr Owen, head of Rushmoor School, Bedford, said UK education was 'in crisis' because of low staying-on rates, poor vocational training, high failure rates at A-level and weaknesses in language teaching. His conclusions on language are borne out by a survey of UK companies dealing with foreign tourists which found that only one-third are equipped to deal with customers' language requirements. In the single market, Mr Owen said, if a British job vacancy was advertised across Europe, at least half the applications would come from foreigners with fluent English and technical and managerial qualifications. 'The British applicants perhaps left school at 16, or at 18, with poor results,' he said. 'They have no other qualifications, but have picked up a little varied experience at the times when they have been in work.' The ISA's Rouen conference has followed a recent pattern of independent school heads decamping to the continent to laud 'Europe 1992' and lament the crisis in British education.

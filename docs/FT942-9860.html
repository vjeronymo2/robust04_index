			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / Question mark over UK politics: The three main national parties must look afresh at themselves John Smith brought a sense of decency and fair play to public life. He embodied Labour's passion for social justice. He had the manner and the bearing of a prime minister. In office, he would have been excellent. In opposition, he followed his own instincts, which were not everyone's. When I last saw him, a couple of weeks ago, he was good-humoured, confident that his strategy of keeping Labour's options open would ensure victory at the next general election. Many Conservatives thought the same. His death leaves a huge question mark over British politics. All three national parties must look afresh at themselves; all must re-determine the basis on which they offer their services to the electorate. The Thatcherite certainties of the 1980s have melted away. Ideology has vanished. Debates that might have been concluded years ago remain to be settled. The distinguishing feature of the political discourse of the 1990s is confusion. This is apparent in north America, where in recent elections the Canadians nearly obliterated their Conservatives and millions of Americans voted for Ross Perot. It is evident in continental western Europe, where the old Christian Democrat/Social Democrat consensus is visibly crumbling. In short, the world has changed. The nations of the north Atlantic can no longer aspire to economic self-sufficiency. They either join trading blocs, or seek to open themselves to the global marketplace, or both. The social structure of the 1950s, in which the archetype was a two-parent family with the father earning the income and the mother minding the children, is being replaced by many and varied forms of cohabitation. Men have been losing permanent employment, while women have taken cheaper part-time or temporary jobs. The relationship between capital and labour has been subtly altered by the fall of communism. Trade unions must adapt or fade away. Unemployment, or the fear of it, has touched most families. There is a perception, not wholly supported by reality, that crime is increasing at a relentless pace. In many cities people prefer not to walk alone in dark streets. No wonder the voters are nervous. Traditional parties of government cannot guarantee deliverance from such apprehensions. It is not surprising that some Europeans are turning to the far-right, or the Greens. In Britain they are not sure where to place their crosses. Last week's local election results tell the story. The Tories are not, in their current mood, attractive. The Liberal Democrats are once again resurgent, but they will probably remain a repository for protest. Labour did well, but not well enough. In spite of everything that has happened to the government, the people's party scored a lower share of the popular vote than the Conservatives did at the last general election. What is likely to follow from Labour's search for a new leader is a tangle. The behaviour of each of the three national parties will affect the fortunes of the other two. Take Labour first. At bottom it is still the political wing of the trade union movement. In choosing whether to break away from that constraint, it starts from where it was in April 1992. Mr Neil Kinnock, who resigned as leader after losing the election, had 'modernised,' the party, but insufficiently so. Voter-repellent policies such as unilateral disarmament, renationalisation, a return to the pre-1979 trade union legislation, and anti-Europeanism were jettisoned. What remained was still visibly the political wing of the unions, offering a programme of red-rose regulation. Labour longed for a return to big government, as its many undertakings indicated. The promises made under Mr Kinnock enabled the Conservatives to warn of a 'tax bombshell' if he won. This dubious tactic succeeded. A shocked Labour party quickly elected Mr Smith as its new leader. The vote was as good as unanimous. In spite of the candidacy of Mr Bryan Gould, there was no serious debate about how the world had changed. Party policy was taken as Mr Kinnock had left it, preserved in aspic, and set aside. The exception was taxation, in which an effort was made to dissociate Labour from its earlier stated ambitions. This strategy seemed to Mr Smith to justify itself. The Conservatives were tearing themselves apart. Why should Labour interfere? Some progress was made. In October last year Mr Smith bravely gambled on a single vote at the party conference. The union bloc vote was abolished, in favour of one-person-one-vote. Yet Labour still depends on the unions for financial support. It is still the parliamentary expression of the labour movement. Members vote individually, but the danger remains that unions may organise a powerful constituency for 'old Labour', the party pulled by a carthorse, the gang of comrades associated in the public mind with queues, levelling-down, the maximalist state, and shoddy council housing. The new leader will have his or her work cut out to complete the transformation initiated under Mr Kinnock. 'New Labour', if it came into being, would seek market solutions to unemployment, radical policies on crime, and 1990s - not 1950s - approaches to education, health and social services. The party leader would value the intent behind 'back to basics' in a world worried about the effect of sex 'n violence on family life. Only one of the likely candidates fully understands what needs to be done, and has the character necessary to convince former Conservatives and Liberal Democrats that 'new Labour' could meet their aspirations. He is Mr Tony Blair. Mr Gordon Brown is a 'moderniser,' but dolorous. Mr Robin Cook has the intelligence to sound modern, but he comes across as too clever by half. Mr John Prescott is wily, but looks 'old Labour'. There are other potential candidates, but Mr Blair towers above them all. If 'old Labour' prevails the Conservatives will feel reprieved. The British polity would be the loser. For just as Labour failed to transmogrify itself after April 1992, so the Tories trundled, if a little unsteadily, along the same old tramlines after November 1990. Lady Thatcher left office, but Thatcherism stayed behind. The party is now hopelessly divided. Mr John Major added insult to injury by winning in April 1992 when, in the Thatcherite view, the upstart was supposed to lose. He has strained himself to please first the Europhiles, then the Eurosceptics, but the Conservatives are beyond the tactics of one of nature's whips. Europe is the largest problem, but not the only one. The application of quasi-market principles to education and health has not worked well, yet no re-thinking is being done. Local government has been all but destroyed. Ministers are exhausted or complacent or both. Administration is sloppy. Bills are hastily drafted and as hastily amended. Survival is the predominant motivation for most cabinet decisions. What the Conservatives need above all is a period of rest and recuperation in opposition. Whether they get it depends in large part on what Labour does now. The Liberal Democrats will also be affected by Labour's decision. They have tried harder than the other two to understand the new world. Mr Paddy Ashdown, the party leader, recently spent some time with 'ordinary people' and wrote a book about his experiences. He proposes a less hierarchical society, better education, reduced dependence on central government, communities responsible for their own actions. Mr Blair's Labour would be directly competitive with such a package; it would also embrace Mr Ashdown's party if need be. The Liberal Democrats might flourish more if an 'old Labour' leader emerges. An unreformed Tory party plus an unreconstructed Labour must help the purveyors of the third choice. That is the long-term outlook. The elections to the European parliament and the fate of Mr Major will occupy us in the next few weeks. These are minor matters. The choice by Labour of a leader to succeed Mr Smith is potentially of far greater importance.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 4 (XINHUA) -- Qiao Shi, chairman of the  Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said here  today that Chinese youngsters should adhere to the basic line of  the Communist Party of China (CPC) and shoulder the historic  responsibilities of promoting the country's development.    Today is China's "May 4th" Youth Day. It is also the 75th  anniversary of China's "May 4th Movement" of 1919, an  anti-imperialist, anti-feudal political and cultural movement  led by intellectuals imbued with the rudiments of communist  ideology.    Qiao Shi, who is also a member of the Standing Committee of  the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, presented a  "Chinese youth volunteers" flag to eight young volunteer service  teams at the Great Hall of the People this morning.    At the flag presentation ceremony, Qiao said that China now  is in a critical period of historical development. The  realization of the great goal of the country's development  depends on youngsters' hard work, he said.    He expressed the hope that organizations of the Chinese  Communist Youth League (CCYL) will further develop youngsters'  voluntary service activities and make more contributions to  China's socialist construction.    He also urged Chinese young people to carry forward the  spirit of patriotism and collectivism and train themselves to be  qualified personnel for the next century.    The young volunteer activities were sponsored by the CCYL  Central Committee last December. The eight volunteer service  teams will go to poor areas in the country to help develop local  economies, eliminate illiteracy and provide health services.    Vice-Premier Li Lanqing also conferred "youth civilization  models" plaques on six exemplary youth groups from China's  public transportation departments here today.    Some 10,000 Beijing young people took the CCYL oath on  joining the organization at Tiananmen Square today. More than  one million new Youth League members also took the oath in other  parts of the country.</p>

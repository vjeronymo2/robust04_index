			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Boris Krivoshey and </F> Aleksandr Krylovich]    [Text] Moscow, 14 Apr -- The Russian Foreign Ministry has  expressed regret that the Russian delegation sent to Ukraine in  connection with the recent incidents around the Black Sea Fleet  was not given the opportunity of visiting Odessa. This was said  at a briefing today by Grigoriy Karasin, director of the Russian  Foreign Ministry's information and press department.    He said "the Russian delegation proposed visiting Odessa  together with Ukrainian representatives." According to G.  Karasin, "the Russian side made this proposal in the belief that  a joint visit to Odessa by Russian and Ukrainian representatives  and their possible meetings and conversations with people could  have been received with satisfaction and understanding by public  opinion both in Russia and Ukraine and would have helped ease  the tension which has arisen following the recent incidents  around the Black Sea Fleet in Odessa." Such a joint working  visit would undoubtedly have been in the spirit of cooperation  and friendship between our peoples, the Russian Foreign Ministry  spokesman said.</p>

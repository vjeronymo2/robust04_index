			<p>BFN     [Text] What is the reaction of the cabinet members to the  opinion President Zhelyu Zhelev expressed regarding the current  government? Bilyana Mikhaylova, who at present is at the  Council of Ministers, answers this question.    [Mikhaylova] Perhaps I should remind the listeners that the  president accused the cabinet of delaying the privatization,  failing to encourage foreign investments in Bulgaria, and  blocking the agrarian reform. We were interested in the opinion  of various cabinet members and the prime minister himself  regarding the president's opinion.    Industry Minister Rumen Bikov said that after the commentary  of the prime minister the issue has been exhausted, and he would  not allow himself a commentary as to what the president is doing.    However, Acting Prime Minister Evgeni Matinchev was more  talkative. He said that when the president makes such a  statement this naturally should make the cabinet members uneasy,  but according to him, the president's assessment is more  emotional than based on real grounds in every single aspect  mentioned by the president.    Matinchev also pointed out that no cabinet member  contemplates resignation. He had a talk with Prime Minister  Berov, and neither the prime minister nor he or any other member  of the cabinet intend to resign.    Matinchev did not deny the fact that he feels himself  responsible for the situation in which we find ourselves and the  measures that the government must adopt in order to calm the  situation as soon as possible. He added that he does not think  that the hysteria which developed recently would positively  affect the important accord and agreements that will be signed  soon.    He did not deny that personnel changes were possible, but he  said that it is too soon to talk about this. First of all,  structural changes should take place, and this means assessing  the present situation and deciding how to improve the efficiency  of the government.    It appears that we will not learn anything specific until  the  precise and concrete opinion of the prime minister is issued.</p>

			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Insurer 'sick and tired' of Lloyd's losses hindsight The series of catastrophes such as the Piper Alpha disaster which led to enormous losses by Lloyd's Names could never have been foreseen, a former Gooda Walker underwriter told the High Court yesterday. Mr Anthony Willard, an underwriter with syndicate 299, one of those which insured the North Sea production platform, admitted that the level of re-insurance he had arranged had proved to be inadequate. But he insisted this could not have been appreciated then. Giving evidence in the legal action brought by 3,095 loss-making Gooda Walker Names - the individuals whose assets have traditionally supported the market - Mr Willard said he was 'sick and tired' of people looking at the reasons for Lloyd's losses with hindsight. 'Everyone talks from the supreme heights of hindsight. We were down in the valley doing our jobs. In hindsight, Hitler should never have invaded Russia or Poland. Had I known what was going to happen, I would have done things differently,' he said. The Gooda Names are seeking compensation of Pounds 629m from members agents who placed them with four syndicates, including number 299, managed by the Gooda Walker agency. They claim Mr Willard was guilty of bad underwriting practice in failing to arrange sufficient re-insurance for the business of syndicate 299, which specialised in marine insurance. Mr Willard said he felt 'bitterly disappointed' at the size of the losses, but insisted these were caused by the unforesee-ably large scale of disasters in the late 1980s, not incompetence. He insisted that syndicate 299 had a generally cautious approach to its business and that he had been careful to avoid conducting a disproportionate amount of excess-of-loss business. Mr Willard said that before the Piper Alpha disaster he had considered the syndicate had enough re-insurance. However, he had thought improvements in technology and weather forecasting techniques would reduce the chances of large marine catastrophes in the most likely disaster areas.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara--The establishment of a base for Conference  on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) observers to  Nagorno-Karabakh is in no way similar in mandate or structure to  Provide Comfort II, an allied force stationed in Turkey to  protect Kurds in northern Iraq, a high-level Turkish official  said Sunday [19 June]. Riza Turmen, the Foreign Ministry  director responsible for ties with the CSCE, told reporters that  the "base" in Erzurum would serve as a supply center for the  CSCE observers who would be placed in the region to supervise a  cease-fire between Armenians and Azeris.    The base in Erzurun would have a staff of 10 civilians,  Turmen said.    Turmen also said that the first group of 34 people was  planned to be sent to the Caucasus as soon as a cease-fire was  established. Two weeks later, another 64 would be dispatched and  the number of CSCE observers would be increased to 350. Four  Turks will also be participating in the CSCE mission, Turmen  said.    The mandate of the mission will be to supervise the  cease-fire as well as the return of refugees.    "This large group will need back-up facilities, and Erzurun  was selected to be the suitable spot for such a base," he said.  Various press reports have called the CSCE operation a "Poised  Hammer for the Armenians," drawing parallels between the Erzurum  base and the allied force stationed in the Southeast to deter  Baghdad from attacking the Kurds. The Foreign Ministry has  categorically denied any similarities.</p>

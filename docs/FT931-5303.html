			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Near 40% of Rutland shares changes hands ALMOST 40 per cent of the shares of Rutland Trust, the financial services and property surveying group, changed hands yesterday SPP, part of Trygg-Hansa, Sweden's largest insurance and pensions group, yesterday placed its 32.5 per cent holding with a range of institutional investors. The shares were put through the market at 17p. The move will not trigger any new disclosable holdings in Rutland. It is understood the placing was oversubscribed, partly because of the recent rise in the value of Rutland's 44 per cent owned associate Capital Industries. After the placing, Banque Arjil, part of the Matra-Hachette group, also had its entire holding in Rutland placed, some 4.8 per cent at 18p. Rutland's shares closed up 2p at 20p on the day. The Swedish holding arose out of a 1986 consortium bid for Kellock Trust by London and Edinburgh Trust and Mr Michael Langdon, now chief executive of Rutland Trust. In 1989 SPP bought LET which has recently been loss-making, for Pounds 500m. Mr Langdon said: 'We are pleased to have replaced a weak shareholder which overhung the market with a good quality institutional listing.' He said the group was acquisitive and would continue to look for business opportunities to fit its existing profile.</p>

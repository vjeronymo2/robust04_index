			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / Book Review: Giving might to rights THE WELFARE OF CITIZENS Edited by Anna Coote Institute for Public Policy Research/Rivers Oram Press. Pounds 22 hardback, Pounds 9.95 paperback. 200 pages Labour's fourth election defeat in a row has inspired a new bout of introspection on the political left in Britain. Central planning is discredited; state ownership has few friends; liberalisation and deregulation are more in tune with the spirit of the age. What can social democrats and democratic socialists offer to challenge the apparent triumph of liberal capitalism? Some claim that the answer lies in constitutional reform, terrain already well staked out by the Liberal Democrats. Others follow the German social democrats in seeing the environment as the new battleground between unrestrained market forces and human development. This intriguing book from the left-leaning Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) suggests a third option: a new form of citizenship based not just on democratic rights but also on economic and social rights. The contributors examine the case for such rights and explore the scope for embodying them in a legally enforceable charter. The argument runs as follows: political freedoms are meaningless if all they amount to is 'freedom from' interference by others. The only purpose of such negative freedoms is what they permit individuals to do. But if individuals lack the resources to make use of their political freedom, they are not free at all. Creating 'freedom to' requires rights to health, education and welfare so that individuals can use their political rights to pursue worthwhile goals. The case for positive rights is not, of course, new. Mr Roy Hattersley, the deputy leader of the opposition Labour party, has used it for the past decade as the centrepiece for his arguments in favour of greater equality. But it is given a new twist in the IPPR book with the argument advanced by Professor Raymond Plant, chair of Labour's commission on electoral reform, that if welfare rights are to be meaningful, they must be conferred upon individuals who should be given powers to enforce them. This marks a significant break with the left tradition that welfare should be provided collectively through the state. Professor Plant accepts the 'public choice' critique which focuses on the alarming tendency of 'democratically accountable' services to be captured by their producers. He is prepared to consider a wide range of alternative ways of enforcing rights to welfare, which empower individual citizens to make their own choices within a framework which guarantees economic and social rights. One option would be to embody such rights in law - to prescribe basic standards of health care, social security and housing for example. Attempts to create legal entitlements to economic rights are notoriously difficult to pull off, however. International charters which make the attempt are inevitably vague about the detail and well-larded with exclusion clauses ('as resources allow', and the like). They also have a tendency to provide at least as much work for lawyers as help for the disadvantaged. The alternative strategy is to go for procedural rights - rights to fair treatment for individuals who use welfare services. This approach clearly attracts the IPPR, which devotes much of the book to devising principles of procedural fairness and applying them in specific services such as social work and health care. The discussion is fascinating, particularly in the detail - for example, how to reconcile the rights of children and parents in child-abuse cases. However this emphasis on procedural rights looks very similar to what Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, is up to with his Citizen's Charter. That, after all, is an attempt to provide a set of such rights for users of public services, including information about quality targets and compensation when things go wrong. Is the IPPR's approach any different? The book argues that Mr Major's system of charters is a cosmetic attempt to hide deficiencies in underfunded public services. More tellingly, it says that the provision of essential public services cannot be reduced to the sort of simple consumer model envisaged by some supporters of the Citizen's Charter. Collective action is needed to decide on levels of provision and to ensure equal access to health, education and welfare. But perhaps the truth is more prosaic: we are all charterists now. Outside the ranks of a few die-hard libertarians, agreement is widespread that there are core public services which cannot be privatised and must be funded by the exchequer. In the absence of appropriate incentives, centrally-funded services will undervalue the needs of the users. Charters which give the users rights to bang on the table and extract compensation for bad service are one way of redressing the balance. Whether they provide Labour with the means to seize back the initiative on the welfare state is another matter.</p>

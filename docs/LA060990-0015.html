			<p><P> June 9, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: SIMI VALLEY;  </P> <P> TRANSIENT TO STAND TRIAL IN SLAYING  </P> <P> A 22-year-old transient has been ordered to stand trial for murder in the fatal  shooting and robbery of a Simi Valley insurance worker.  </P> <P> After a preliminary hearing in Ventura County Municipal Court, Oscar Rudolfo  Barrascout was held to answer charges of murder, burglary, robbery and use of a  firearm in the May 18 slaying of Gregory D. Minor, 37.  </P> <P> Barrascout also was charged with a special circumstance -- committing murder  during a felony -- which allows prosecutors to seek the death penalty if they  so choose, Deputy Dist. Atty. Donald C. Glynn said. No decision has yet been  made to seek such a penalty.  </P> <P> Barrascout is being held in lieu of $1-million bail in the Ventura County Jail  pending his arraignment July 12 in Ventura County Superior Court.  </P> <P> Police found Minor's body under his bed and the bedroom furniture in disarray  on May 18. Witnesses at the hearing testified that Barrascout had visited Minor  to look at a white 1984 Corvette that Minor was selling.  </P> <P> The keys to the Corvette were found in the van where Barrascout was sleeping  when Simi Valley police detectives arrested him early on May 19. Police also  found a diamond-faced, gold watch inscribed with Minor's initials, witnesses  said.  </P> <P> Also in the van, police found the .22-caliber semiautomatic pistol that  Barrascout allegedly used to kill Minor.  </P> <P> Two of Barrascout's friends testified that he showed them the gun while driving  to the beach the day before Minor's death.  </P> <P> Barrascout asked if the gun was powerful enough to kill someone, testified one  of the friends, David Morales.

			<p><P> February 23, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 2 REPORTED PREGNANT BY GARVEY  </P> <P> Two women became pregnant while involved with Steve Garvey, the former All-Star  first baseman of the Los Angeles Dodgers and San Diego Padres who recently  married a third woman, a TV station reported.  </P> <P> A San Diego woman, who declined to be interviewed on camera, said she recently  gave birth to Garvey's child, according to a Wednesday report by San Diego TV  station KNSD, an NBC affiliate.  </P> <P> The other woman alleging that Garvey made her pregnant is Rebecca Mendenhall, a  producer for Atlanta-based Cable Television Network. She was engaged to Garvey  during the past year.  </P> <P> A call to Garvey's office, seeking comment, was not immediately returned today.  </P> <P> In a videotaped interview broadcast by KNSD, Garvey did not deny the  allegations and promised to assume responsibility for any offspring proven to  be his. He said his new wife, interior decorator Candace Thomas, 30, of Palos  Verdes, knows all about the two situations.  </P> <P> "I'll live up to my moral obligations, which I feel strongly about because I'm  a Christian," he said.  </P> <P> Garvey said his new wife supports his decision to take responsibility for any  children he fathered while single.  </P> <P> The couple was married Saturday in a private ceremony in Utah.  </P> <P> "I guess the true test when you love somebody, and I've told my wife about all  the situations in my life -- this and others -- and she said that if that's the  case and one woman or both don't want the child, I'll take it.  </P> <P> "That's the philosophy she has. On the other hand, she said, 'It's a good thing  I married you to get you off the street.' "  </P> <P> When asked about birth control, Garvey, a Roman Catholic said: "I'd like to  think that with any relationship, one of the two people assume responsibility  for birth control and . . . one will say, 'I'll be responsible.'  </P> <P> "In both cases, I was led to believe that I wasn't responsible for birth  control."  </P> <P> Garvey said he doesn't think any pregnancies he caused while a bachelor will  hamper future political aspirations, saying people will respect his decision to  support any children he fathered.  </P></p>

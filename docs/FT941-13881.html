			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Arts: Turin falls for 'Fille' - British ballet enchants Italy It is strange to reflect that Italy was the cradle of ballet, before the French and Russians adopted it. Right up until the beginning of this century, Italian dancers were the most eminent stars in the ballet world, and Italian ballet training perhaps the most influential. Today, Italian ballet training has no high standing. Alessandra Ferri and Viviana Durante, two of the world's leading female dancers, are Italians who came to London to complete their training and to launch their international careers. How odd, then, to see the Birmingham Royal Ballet, an unstellar ensemble dancing Frederick Ashton's unglamorous classic La Fille mal gardee in Turin last weekend. Not all seats were filled; some Torinese opera subscribers chose not to occupy their seats. And those who attended did not at first know how to react. Could a ballet really be this rural and comic and touching and humane? Could dance steps really be arranged with this much intricacy? Could so much tender detail be poured into a work whose plot is so simple? Could sophisticated Northern Italians enjoy something as homespun as this? The answer was yes - eventually. The opening performance was, by all accounts, politely received, no more. At the second performance, large numbers of the audience were sufficiently delighted to rush forward to the stage, to bathe in the dancers' radiance as they applauded. The next day the critics of the Corriere della Sera, Giornale, and La Stampa proclaimed the opening performance of Fille to have been a triumph, delicious, a joy. One must compliment Peter Wright, the BRB's artistic director, on using La Fille as his calling-card. Last year the Royal Ballet (the Covent Garden branch) came to Turin with Mayerling and Anthony Dowell's stagings of Swan Lake - productions that you would have thought anyone could tell would fail on the European continent. The BRB is not the better company - La Fille is danced slightly better by the Covent Garden ensemble - but many Torinese certainly now think it is. Certainly La Fille becomes the Birmingham dancers; I have not admired this troupe's dancing so much for several years. Ashton's skill in characterisation was the most remarked-upon feature of the ballet; with especial delight found in the travesty playing of the grouchy but warm-hearted Widow Simone ('la mamma') and the happy simpleton Alain. But people also exclaimed with amazement that never before had they seen ballet with the harmony, structure, and fluency of music - that watching it was like reading a score. I, who have probably seen La Fille over 60 times, found myself discovering new felicities in its construction - and yet envying those were discovering it for the first time. During my brief visit, I was able to watch the company's first two casts. Irek Mukhamedov, a guest star from Covent Garden, danced Colas. He had a few more problems with the steps than when he first took the role at Covent Garden two years ago, and he forces a few features of the characterisation. But you could still feel the virile charm and Bolshoi sweep that makes Mukhamedov so immensely impressive a dancer. Tiny, pert, Sandra Madgwick was his Lise. The sharp coloratura of her dancing, the impetuous fun of her playing have made her a splendid inheritor of this role since her student days. Perhaps she is at times too sharp, too shy of bringing out the melting lyricism of the ballet's more lovelorn passages; but her dancing is as naturally brilliant as birdsong. David Morse and Vincent Redmon, as Simone and Alain, gave performances that at all points made the ballet's detail (and thereby its entire world) more real. The second cast, by one of those happy flukes, had several more flaws and yet was altogether even more delightful. Dorcas Walters lacks all the finesse for Lise's dances, but the brightness of her jump on the one hand and the gentleness of her playing on the other makes her performance varied and absorbing; Sergiu Poberezhnic, attentive but weak as a partner and generous but tense as a soloist, has tremendous warmth and youthful panache as Colas; Edwin Mota was an exaggerated but sweet Alain. And Michael O'Hare was a marvellous Simone; I have not seen the episode when he suddenly wakes and blearily snaps straight back into action so vividly done for many years. Above and beyond any of the dancers, I praise the company's young conductor Philip Ellis. Each time I hear him, I think he is the best thing to have happened to British ballet music since the late Ashley Lawrence. He shapes the music of such minor composers as Auber, Herold, and Minkus with the brio, love, and finesse it deserves; he lends sparkle to otherwise weak dancers; and to precise dancers he gives stimulus and power. Playing under him, the orchestra of Turin's Teatro Reggio gave the score unusual elegance and wit.</p>

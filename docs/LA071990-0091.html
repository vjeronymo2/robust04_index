			<p><P> July 19, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: SIMI VALLEY;  </P> <P> 8 REQUEST PAPERS TO FILE FOR OFFICE  </P> <P> Eight prospective candidates for two seats on the Simi Valley City Council and  the mayor's office have requested nomination papers from the City Clerk's  office, the first step to running for office in the November election.  </P> <P> To qualify for a position on the ballot, each candidate must collect the  signatures of 20 registered voters and submit them to the city clerk's office  by Aug. 10, said Lucia Alvelais, a city spokeswoman. Monday was the first day  of the filing period.  </P> <P> Among the first candidates who requested nomination papers Monday was  Councilwoman Ann Rock, who plans to seek her third term on the five-member  council, Alvelais said.  </P> <P> Alfred J. Wilson Sr., a political newcomer, is the only candidate so far to  request papers for the office of mayor, she said.  </P> <P> Although Mayor Greg Stratton has not taken out his nomination papers, he is  expected to run for reelection. Stratton has served as mayor since 1986 and as  a member of the council since 1979, longer than any other member.  </P> <P> Councilwoman Vicky Howard, whose terms expires in November, is giving up her  seat to run for county supervisor against fellow council member Bill Davis.  Davis' term does not expire until 1992.  </P> <P> Other candidates vying for a seat on the council include Planning Commissioner  Judy Mikels, 45, who has served on the commission for four years; Harold Fick,  52, a local businessman who lost his bid for a county supervisor seat in the  June primary election; community activist John Etter, 45; Chamber of Commerce  member Sandi Webb, 41; neighborhood activist Marilyn Maurer, 56; and Kenneth  Wenning.

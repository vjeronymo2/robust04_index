			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / LSE bids Pounds 65m for County Hall: University's governors concerned over pressure on finances GOVERNORS of the London School of Economics are worried about the viability of the Pounds 65m bid submitted yesterday for County Hall, the landmark London site it is seeking as its new headquarters. At least one fears that the move could bankrupt the social science university unless it is supported by a direct government subsidy. In cash terms, the LSE bid is almost certainly lower than the Pounds 60m sale price agreed with the Japanese Shirayama Corporation for the riverside building alone. The building comprises less than half the County Hall site which is the subject of the LSE bid. The LSE believes the 'public interest' aspects of its bid justify the shortfall. However several of its governors are understood to have expressed concern at a meeting on Thursday that some of the assumptions upon which the bid is based  - notably the LSE's ability to dispose of its existing Aldwych site for about Pounds 100m within three years  - are unrealistic. They are also concerned that the cost of servicing a loan of up to Pounds 50m would put unsustainable pressure on the LSE's finances. Mr John Ashworth, the LSE's director, is believed to have assured them that the offer was not irrevocable, although the government told the LSE last week that its bid should be 'unconditional'. Mr Ashworth said his bid, submitted just before the government's end-of-month deadline, was 'very sensible  - not just financially, but in the national interest more broadly'. Hambros Bank, the LSE's financial adviser, said it was 'entirely happy' with the bid, and was prepared to lend a 'substantial' part of the sum. However, the Universities Funding Council is believed to be unwilling to indicate support for the bid without further justification. Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, will take a final decision by early September. Mr Makoto Toyota, Shirayama's London agent, called for the bid's 'immediate rejection', on the grounds that it was neither competitive nor unconditional. Shirayama intends to pursue its legal action for damages from the government for losses caused by the continued refusal to rule out an LSE bid.</p>

He summed up in the interview  the results of the second all-European conference on the  ministerial level on cooperation in the struggle against drug  addiction, which came to a close here. The conference was  attended by representatives of 32 member states of the Council  of Europe, as well as those which have the status of specially  invited at that organisation. "We regard the invitation of  Russia to this forum as one more step on the way towards  Russia's integration in the united Europe and the joining of the  Council of Europe. This is why we are attaching special  importance to it," Yerin stressed.    "In my opinion, the conference provided a good basis for the  development of cooperation in the struggle against drug  addiction as a social phenomenon and against drug trafficking,  which is closer to the tasks facing law-enforcement agencies,"  he continued. According to his estimate, the Strasbourg  conference was unanimous in the general political, social and  professional assessment of that phenomenon. It outlined the  main directions of work, which open up broad prospects for the  development of cooperation both on the European level and within  the framework of bilateral contacts, specifically, in the  expansion of preventive work and joint actions in the spheres,  which are within the competence of law-enforcement agencies.    "Such conferences are not only of major political  importance,  but also of much practical interest, because they make it  possible for every country to advance, using the experience of  other countries. We shall use international experience as much  as we can, specifically, when coming up with legislative  initiatives and submitting them to parliament through the  government and the president," Yerin said.</p>

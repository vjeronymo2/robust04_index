			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IBM UNVEILS ITS NEW GENERATION OF MAINFRAMES;  </P> <P> HIGH TECH: ANALYSTS SAID THE ANNOUNCEMENT WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE BIG BLUE  HAS MADE IN A QUARTER OF A CENTURY.  </P> <P> In what was termed its most important announcement in 25 years, International  Business Machines on Wednesday unveiled its new generation of mainframe  computers, machines the company said will set its tone in this all-important  market for the rest of the century.  </P> <P> In all, the company announced 140 new products, including 18 new computers,  that on average will double the computing power of the current models, which  are used to handle such complex tasks as automated banking transactions,  airline reservations, insurance policy tracking and inventory controls.  </P> <P> Surprising many analysts, the company said 11 of the 18 new computers are  immediately available and that all but three will be available within nine  months. However, many other remaining products, including a wide range of IBM  software that will give the machines their additional power and speed, won't be  available until mid- or late 1991.  </P> <P> Still, IBM's announcement, coming a day after rival Japanese mainframe maker  Fujitsu unveiled a competing model, was generally viewed as among IBM's most  aggressive moves in a year marked by uncharacteristically bold IBM product  launches.  </P> <P> "IBM's objective is to regenerate mainframe demand and I believe they can  achieve this," said Bob Djurdjevic, a Phoenix technology analyst. "I think they  are uncorking mainframe demand."  </P> <P> Although the new generation of mainframes had been dubbed "Summit" by financial  analysts and computer industry observers during its seven-year-long  development, IBM officials said the new family never had that code name and is  known only as system 390 at Big Blue.  </P> <P> "This is it," laughed George Conrades, IBM's senior vice president for  marketing services when asked about Summit at Wednesday's press conference  here. "This is what we have all been waiting for."  </P> <P> Despite some early praise for IBM's moves, analysts remained divided over  whether the company can achieve one of its key objectives for its new mainframe  family: quickly reversing its sagging performance of the last few years.  Several Wall Street analysts had been predicting a rocky transition and  possibly sagging profits for the company as it attempts this sweeping product  launch, its most ambitious since it introduced its first mainframe 25 years  ago.  </P> <P> Unlike its previous product rollouts, this year IBM faces a weak U.S. economy  and softening demand even in Europe, which has been a strong source of sales,  noted Ulrich Weil, a Washington analyst. Further, competition is intensifying  from such Japanese rivals as Fujitsu and Hitachi.  </P> <P> Mainframes are big business for IBM, accounting for more than 50% of its $62.7  billion in sales last year and perhaps as much as 60% of its $3.7 billion in  profit. But IBM's share of the market is slipping, from 95% of U.S. sales in  1987 to 87% this year, according to estimates from Computer Intelligence, a San  Jose market research firm.  </P> <P> Further, there are increasing signs that growth of the overall mainframe market  is slowing as smaller systems become more powerful and take over tasks once  reserved for the giant machines.  </P> <P> IBM has made it clear that it wants to disprove the conventional wisdom that  huge mainframe computers -- often disparagingly referred to as dinosaurs -- are  things of the past.  </P> <P> "We believe strongly in the future of large systems," said Carl J. Conti,  general manager of IBM's Enterprise Systems Unit. "The role of these large  systems is continuing to expand." IBM executives said the new systems contain a  variety of new technology and design approaches. Among the more notable  advances they cited are:  </P> <P> * New software to connect IBM mainframe to a wider variety of computers from  other manufacturers;  </P> <P> * High-speed fiber optic lines that can connect machines up to 5.6 miles away,  without any loss of power or speed;  </P> <P> * Increased use of so-called parallel processing designs that will allow  customers to string together as many as eight separate mainframe systems, each  with six individual information processing units, to create a 48-processor  system;  </P> <P> * An attention to security concerns with a new cryptographic system to include  sensitive data being sent over networks, a development said already to have  aroused the interest of the Central Intelligence Agency.  </P> <P> Company executives said 50 of the new systems will be delivered before the end  of the month and by next year the system 390 will account for more than 50% of  IBM's mainframe sales.  </P> <P> Again executives said sales throughout this year and into next will be aided by  aggressive incentives to customers, including generous trade-in allowances on  their existing IBM mainframes.  </P> <P> Early comparisons to Fujitsu's new mainframe are difficult, analysts said,  because little is known about the Japanese maker's system. However, Djurdjevic,  who has tested the Fujitsu machine, said it appears to have faster processors,  capable of handling about 50 million instructions per second, a common  measurement of computer speed. IBM's new models can handle about 41 million  instructions per second, he said.  </P> <P> Nevertheless Djurdjevic said that by other measurements, including software,  ability to connect a variety of machines and other features, the IBM systems  are superior.  </P> <P> </P> <P> HIGH-END MAINFRAME COMPUTER MARKET  </P> <P> Number of systems physically in place in companies within U.S. boundaries, as  of January 1990.  </P> <P> IBM: 87%  </P> <P> Amdahl*: 9%  </P> <P> Hitachi: 4%  </P> <P> *Amdahl is 45% owned by Fujitsu  </P> <P> </P> <P> POWER SURGE  </P> <P> Increase In Main Frame Power  </P> <P> Increase in aggregate power of all mainframes installed (in millions of  instructions per second-MIPS)  </P> <P> 1981: 17,593  </P> <P> 1990: 286,068  </P> <P> Increase in number of mainframes installed  </P> <P> 1981: 17,504  </P> <P> 1990: 27,300  </P> <P> Source: Computer intelligence  </P></p>

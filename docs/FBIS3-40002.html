The suspect lives in Germany, belongs to  the extreme-right scene, and possibly assembled the fiendish  envelopes while on a visit to Austria.    The Wiesbaden Federal Office of Criminal Investigation  searched the suspect's apartment in Germany with "interesting  results."    Further investigations are in progress, but the man has not  been arrested. No further details were reported because of the  news blackout.    Commenting on Peter Binder and Franz Radl junior, who are  imprisoned in Vienna, Interior Minister Franz Loeschnak said  that there are 25 pieces of evidence in their case. Moreover,  there are two witnesses who have incriminated the two neo-Nazis.    According to Loeschnak, all in all, this incriminating  material should be sufficient to bring charges in a few weeks --  charges "that will stand."    Regarding the new "hot scent" leading to Germany, the police  assume that this right-wing extremist might have made the letter  bombs during a visit to Austria.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk with </F> unidentified reporters in Kiev on 14 January -- recorded]    [Text] Reporter: Can you say if the document  that was signed by the three presidents in the Kremlin today  will have to be ratified by the Ukrainian parliament? Will it  help resolve the issue of disarmament in general, both in Europe  and on CIS territory? Is this primarily a new step or not?  Third, to what extent will it help Ukraine's economy?    Kravchuk: The document is a continuation of the  Ukrainian Supreme Council resolutions. If you recall, the  reservations that it put forth were about compensation for  tactical and strategic nuclear weapons, their technical  maintenance, financial and technical aid, and [security]  guarantees. These, approximately, were the main reservations of  the Supreme Council. When you read that document, and it will  be published, you will find that all of those demands were met.  In other words, we can positively state that the executive  branch has not been acting contrary to the Supreme Council  resolutions but acting toward fulfilling the reservations put  forth by the Supreme Council. I would like to emphasize this  fact so that no one thinks, as some try to imply, that the  president and the parliament were following their own separate  courses. We did satisfy the reservations. I said in the past  -- and I am confirming it now -- that we must join the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty. This is my deep conviction, because  everyone has already joined it -- Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan,  and 131 countries. This is a normal step for Ukraine. This is  why I hope that when we inform our parliament about our actions  since December... [pauses] a very difficult time for Ukraine,  which had to withstand pressure from all over the world. Not  everyone understood our steps, not everyone understood our  actions and there were grounds for this. This, I think, is a  matter of principle. Now about your question as to who this  document will serve. Both the talks with the U.S. President in  Kiev and the trilateral talks have confirmed one irrefutable  truth -- problems can be resolved only on the path of  compromises and agreements. No reservations, no guarantees  expressed in documents or agreements or declarations or anything  else will be realized if one or another state follows the policy  of confrontation instead of compromise. If, for instance,  Ukraine... [pauses] now they say that Ukraine has been brought  to its knees. This is absurd. First, Ukraine has come out of  the situation with credit. We will be compensated and given  assistance; we will be respected politically and in other ways.  If we had opposed the adopted course and stood in the way of  nuclear disarmament -- and it was anticipated -- if Ukraine had  failed to fulfill its obligations, it would have blocked the  further development of nuclear disarmament. It would have  blocked it. START II depends on the resolution of the START I  issue. I hope that there will be START III as well, and the  final goal will be achieved in the total dismantling of nuclear  weapons on our planet. Thus, Ukraine, having resolved this  issue, unblocked nuclear disarmament for the whole world, for  all of humanity. By taking this step Ukraine testified to the  fact that there are no separate paths for Ukraine -- it follows  the path of civilization and all human interest. This is the  main issue for all the European and world community. By taking  this step we have raised Ukraine's political prestige and image,  we have confirmed that Ukraine's policies are predictable.  [passage omitted]    Reporter, HOLOS UKRAYINY newspaper: Leonid  Makarovych, I have a question. The answer to it concerns many  people: Will our state's national security be consolidated  after today's signing [of the trilateral agreement]? If so,  what changes for the better can be expected?    Kravchuk: It will be consolidated in the following  aspect: We have already experienced a completely different  attitude toward Ukraine--from Russia, for example. You have  seen a different attitude toward us by the United States during  the U.S. President's visit. I also have reports that NATO  countries have come to understand Ukraine after receiving the  bit of information which we still have to think over today.  This way, the international environment and our neighbors have  accepted Ukraine as a state that does not want evil but wants to  live in friendship, partnership, and cooperation with other  countries. This is the first point. Second, you understand  that it is an illusion to say that the weapons we have owned  were a deterrent. I have already told you about this  deterrence; this is just a danger of deterrence rather than the  deterrent [as received]. Because we are unable to produce,  operate, restore, or service them--because we have nothing:  neither industry nor testing grounds--what kind of deterrence  can we talk about? This is an illusion of deterrence, but it  was hammered into people's heads. The weapons have not been a  guarantee of security, but a source of threat--and not only to  Ukraine. This way, having won support from certain people and  states, including powerful states, we have obtained security.  Security does not mean signed documents. You know how many  pacts have already been signed in history, how many other  documents have been signed. However, they have been  insufficient because a state policy has been against what has  been signed. We want our policy to be implemented in real  terms, in line with our civilized and anticipated concept, which  has been approved. I am convinced that we have obtained  security and opened the path to economic cooperation. We have  also achieved a state's image. We have acted in line with our  Supreme Council, and I am convinced that the majority of the  people of Ukraine want this.    Reporter: At the recent news conference with  Moldovan President Snegur you said something like this: The  danger coming from the revanchist forces in Russia has  increased. If such factors in the policy of our neighbor  dominate, how do you think the signed agreement can be fulfilled  and what mechanism of ensuring our national security do you see  as the head of state?    Kravchuk: Well, first, I said this a little  differently. I said I felt anxiety. [sentence indistinct]  However, the words danger and anxiety have subtle differences  in connotation. Danger means that this is somewhere here...  [pauses] As far as anxiety is concerned, it is known to me, and  every person must feel it when complicated processes are under  way. However, I will repeat that this is not a state policy but  a political trend. Political trends have occurred in history,  you know about that. Let us take the last 300 years, and we  will find different trends in all spheres of social life:  spiritual and political spheres, and this is a normal democratic  phenomenon. However, such a tendency must not become a state  policy. To prevent this, we must cooperate first of all with  Russia. There are 205 million of us in Russia and Ukraine.  Difficult processes are under way in our country too. One  should not attribute them only to Russia. They are everywhere.  Revanchists, nationalists, national patriots reveal themselves  everywhere; they are coming out, because such is the time now.  Let us prevent them from standing in the way of progressive  development. This is a democratic way. However, to prevent this  from becoming a state policy is our responsibility and our  common concern. When we say that we have signed an agreement by  three presidents today, this speaks volumes. Normal cooperation  begins from this point: politically, economically, and  spiritually. Those forces that today are in opposition will  remain there. Opposition must exist, and there is nothing scary  about this. However, one must not allow aggressiveness, and  antipeople, antihumanitarian moods, hidden under patriotism, to  dominate in society. We must not allow this. That is to say, I  feel anxiety but I also have hope, because 14 January is a new  page of understanding our problems, and a page comprised of new  steps. I believe that these steps are aimed against what makes  all of us apprehensive.</p>

			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Manila acts to tighten liquidity The monetary authorities in the Philippines are moving to tighten liquidity in the financial system to keep inflation within targets prescribed by the International Monetary Fund. The move follows the visit of Mr Michel Camdessus, IMF managing director, during which an excess of nearly 8 per cent in the money supply target was discovered. Under the IMF-supervised economic programme approved on June 24, reserve money (currency in circulation, plus deposits and reserves kept by banks with the central bank) was targeted at 148.7bn pesos (Pounds 3.7bn) for September, in line with an inflation rate target of 8.5 per cent by end-1994. A review conducted late in September found that reserve money had reached some 106.5bn pesos, nearly 8 per cent over target. Inflation, which had risen to 9.9 per cent in August, slipped to 8.6 per cent in September. Mr Roberto de Ocampo, finance secretary, pledged to Mr Camdessus to bring down the liquidity level, but did not cite any specific reason for the surge. Analysts said the increase was being traced to the spate of initial public offerings on the local stock market and the refusal of some banks to roll over placements in Treasury bills on expectations of a new rise in interest rates. Mr Camdessus, at the end of his visit on Tuesday, told officials the economy had been performing well, with a first-half growth rate of 5.1 per cent, but 'continued vigilance' was needed against a resurgence of inflation. An IMF team, originally due in Manila in late November, is now being asked to delay its review to December. The authorities appear confident of meeting the end-October reserve money ceiling of 162bn pesos under the IMF programme without fuelling any big increases in rates.</p>

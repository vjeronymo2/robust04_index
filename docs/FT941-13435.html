			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Yeltsin in last effort to retain reformer President Boris Yeltsin will today try to persuade Mr Boris Fyodorov, leading Russian reformer, to stay on as finance minister, amid continuing concern about the future of market reforms. Mr Yeltsin and Mr Fyodorov will discuss conditions on which he would stay in office in an attempt to shore up confidence in Russia's turbulent reform process. Mr Fyodorov, the mainstay of economic reform, said last week he was quitting because two key policy opponents had not been sacked and because Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, planned 'non-monetary' methods to fight inflation. He has also called for the removal of Mr Viktor Gerashchenko, the central bank chairman, who believes that tough monetary and fiscal policies are not what Russia needs. Mr Fyodorov has made no secret of his desire to take over the central bank, but such a move would never be endorsed by parliament. Both Mr Chernomyrdin and Mr Yeltsin, who endorsed the initial cabinet line-up which provoked Mr Fyodorov's resignation threat, appear to have been caught unawares by the international outcry it provoked. Western diplomats yesterday confirmed there were back-stage pleas from the west for Mr Fyodorov to be kept on.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] "The Russian Liberal-Democratic Party denounces the  air strike against the Serb positions near the town of Gorazde  by the UN armed forces," says the party's Supreme Council  statement spread in the State Duma Monday. The statement says  that similar actions "destabilize the situation in the Balkans,  internationalize the conflict, which is the internal affair of  the state structures formed on the basis of the former republics  of Yugoslavia."    The statement says that the world wars of the 20th Century  were unleashed in the Balkans and adds that the "Russian people  support their Serb brothers."    Liberal Democratic party chairman Vladimir Zhirinovskiy is  currently in Strasburg where the Russian parliamentary  delegation takes part in the parliamentary assembly of the  Council of Europe.</p>

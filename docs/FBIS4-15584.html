			<p>BFN     [Text] Baku (April 9) TURAN -- It was announced yesterday  in the Milli Majlis that in 1993 the State's budget deficit  totalled 25.1 billion manats, despite the fact that it was not  supposed to reach 11.7 billion manats.    Fikret Yusifov, Deputy Minister of Finance, stated that the  reason for the high deficit is due to the negative development  in the economy, the fall in productivity and heightened  financial crisis.    The deputies from the PFA [People's Front of Azerbaijan],  the  Musavat party and the National Independence Party urged that the  government accelerate activities in order to curb the inflation  and balance prices in the country with the low salaries.  Discussions about the deficit are to continue next week.</p>

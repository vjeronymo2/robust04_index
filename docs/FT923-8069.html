			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / BAA passenger traffic at record 75m in year to July BAA, THE airports operator, has had its busiest year on record, with more than 75m passengers passing through its airports in the 12 months to July, a rise of 8.2 per cent. Traffic in July was 11 per cent higher than in July last year, when travel was depressed after the Gulf war. The gain on July 1990 was 3 per cent. Mr Mike Hodgkinson, BAA's group airports director, said: 'The figures bear out our expectations on traffic growth for this financial year of 5 per cent to 8 per cent. The drop in domestic traffic seems to have bottomed out and the airport traffic appears to have benefited from price discounting in holiday markets.' Over the year, the strongest growth in destinations was to North America and Ireland, both partly deregulated routes. London's Heathrow remained easily BAA's biggest airport, handling more than 4m people in July, a gain of 10 per cent from a year earlier. Stansted, London's third airport, where a Pounds 400m terminal was opened last year, saw a 27.5 per cent rise in the number of passengers to 270,000. It remained well behind Gatwick, south of London, which handled 2.2m passengers in July, 7.4 per cent more than a year before. Gatwick saw the sharpest decline in passengers of BAA's airports after the Gulf war. Traffic at south-eastern airports grew overall by 10.1 per cent, more slowly than the company's Scottish airports - Glasgow, Edinburgh and Aberdeen - which saw an improvement of 17.9 per cent. BAA said that the British Open golf tournament at Muirfield added to traffic at Edinburgh in July. Freight traffic across the company showed sharper growth of 14.3 per cent overall to more than 89,000 tonnes. At Stansted, freight of 5,000 tonnes was more than double the July 1991 figure. Heathrow continued to dominate cargo, with almost 68,000 tonnes shipped in July.</p>

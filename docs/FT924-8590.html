			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / International Bonds: Judgment reserved on planned Finnish Dollars 1bn issue THE trick is picking the right moment. That is the message to the Republic of Finland from bankers digesting the announcement of its proposed Dollars 1bn global bond issue. Full judgment will be reserved until details are settled, but the degree of shoulder shrugging could be taken to indicate a hint of sovereign fatigue in a market which has been awash with actual and rumoured jumbo sovereign borrowings. The news that Finland plans to issue a minimum Dollars 1bn of global bonds for distribution in Europe, Asia and north America at least removed some uncertainty. Finland has a heavy borrowing programme and is eager to diversify its borrowing base. A global dollar issue is seen as a good way of accessing the US domestic market in what should be its last major external financing of the year. Details of the exact amount, scheduling and maturities of the notes to be issued remain to be settled in discussions with the banks which won the mandate, Merrill Lynch, JP Morgan Securities and Nomura International. Late yesterday, bankers were placing their bets on five-year paper offering 75 to 80 basis points over comparable US Treasuries. This is being hailed as the first sovereign global issue in a sector largely dominated by the World Bank and Canadian provincial borrowers. It is also Finland's first issue targeted at the US since it launched its last Yankee bond issue in March 1988. Mr Veikko Kantola, Finland's director of finance, who was involved in the World Bank's first global issue as a member of its board, says he has since closely followed the experiences of other borrowers in this market. He says: 'The results have been favourable for the borrower and also for the investor, who has an issue that is liquid and movable between the international markets.' Mr Kantola believes that a single global issue will work out cheaper in terms of all-in costs than two separate smaller Euro and Yankee bonds. This is the first time Finland has announced its borrowing plans in advance, says Mr Kantola. 'When the deal is more sizeable it gives the market more time to swallow the idea.' Despite this year's borrowing activity, Finland's debt burden is still, he argues, relatively light. It is now approaching 30 per cent of gross national product compared with just under 20 per cent at the start of the year, and Mr Kantola expects it to peak at just over 40 per cent. Next year's borrowing requirement will be broadly similar to this year's at around Dollars 12bn to Dollars 14bn, to be split approximately equally between foreign and domestic borrowing. Meanwhile, French francs saw another issue launched to tap international demand for the currency. The FFr1bn five-year bond from Banque Nationale de Paris was said to be fairly priced at 50 basis points over the comparable OAT. The issue is fungible with BNP's recent FFr1.5bn issue. Deutsche Bank, which led the Inter-American Development Bank's latest D-Mark offering, said that at DM500m the 10-year bond was small enough to launch using the traditional German structure rather the fixed-price reoffer system. Bankers claiming that there is now potentially strong demand for sterling assets noted that the Pounds 100m five-year issue from Leeds Permanent Building Society suffered in comparison with last Friday's Pounds 200m bond from Halifax Building Society on credit grounds.</p>

			<p><P> May 11, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS  </P> <P> Kennedy Controversy: Rhode Island State Rep. Patrick Kennedy, 22, has had a  run-in with the Catholic Church over the abortion issue, just as his father,  Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.), did. Kennedy was to speak at Prout Memorial High  School in South Kingstown, R.I., last Sunday, but the engagement was canceled  because of Kennedy's abortion rights' stance. Kennedy said he planned to urge  students to get involved and "make a difference." He did not plan to discuss  abortion. Almost a year ago, the St. Vincent de Paul Society canceled an  appearance by Sen. Kennedy in Providence. Both Kennedys favor abortion rights.  </P> <P> McCycle: About 60 fifth- and sixth-graders at Four Mile Elementary school in  Des Moines, Iowa, say they will boycott McDonald's until it becomes more  environmentally aware. The pupils, who complain that the burger firm uses  environmentally damaging plastic foam packages, did some grilling of their own  this week when they invited two local McDonald's executives to meet with their  class. Although the execs argued McDonald's is using thinner foam packages and  has started a recycling project, students remained unconvinced.  </P> <P> Royal Delight: Just to show you how much things have changed in the East Bloc,  Britain's Prince Charles and Princess Diana spent part of Thursday floating on  a boat down the Danube in Budapest. It was the end of their first visit to a  Warsaw Pact country, a trip that delighted Hungarians and made front-page news  there. Diana drew kudos for her charm, her smiles and her elegant clothes.  </P> <P> She Likes Ike: Susan Eisenhower and her new husband, Soviet scientist Roald  Sagdeev, returned Wednesday night from a European trip to honor the centennial  anniversary of the birth of her grandfather, former President Dwight David  Eisenhower. The couple were part a of a delegation that included Vice President  Dan Quayle and his wife, Marilyn. Compiled by Bettijane Levine  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] According to Prime Minister Esko Aho, European Union  [EU] membership is in Finland's national interests if the  government is able to carry through its agricultural subsidy  program. Answering an EU interpellation by the leftist alliance  in the Eduskunta, Aho said the Eduskunta must approve the laws  connected with the agricultural subsidy package before the  national referendum in the fall. According to Aho, military  nonalignment would be the basic tenet of Finland's security  policy even as a member of the EU. Aho emphasized that the  outlining of joint EU foreign policy requires the approval of  each member state when the matter is raised two years from now.  There will also be a separate decision on joining the European  Monetary Union by the Finnish Government and the Eduskunta.  Motions for and against the EU have been prepared for the  interpellation debate.    The Eduskunta will hold a vote of confidence in the  government on 15 June.</p>

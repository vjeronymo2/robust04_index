It's your only opportunity to meet the Coaches during the season -- at  least the only time they appear to be mellow."  </P> <P> After Esperanza's Clay King kicked a field goal in the first quarter for a 3-0  lead, the Aztec band began chanting, "Na-na-na-na, hey-hey-hey, goodbye."  </P> <P> It wasn't quite that easy.  </P> <P> The Aztecs needed an interception by Derek Reaves in the final 10 seconds to  hold on to a 12-7 Empire League victory over Loara.  </P> <P> NOTEWORTHY  </P> <P> Santa Margarita, which defeated Santa Maria 20-12, used three buses to go to  Santa Maria and all three broke down en route. Originally the school had two  buses, but one broke down in Carson and another bus had to replace it. The  replacement bus broke down as well as the other original bus. Santa Margarita  left for its game at 10 a.m. and did not arrive until 7 p.m. at Santa Maria,  which is about 30 miles south of San Luis Obispo.  </P> <P> ON THE RECORD  </P> <P> "Having Tim herewas one of the reasons we were so jittery in the first half.  The locker room was pretty teary before the game. It has been a bad week for  us."  </P> <P>  -- Mike Roark, Brethren coach, after his players wore patches on their jerseys  in honor of teammate Tim Nichol, a running back who suffered a torn hear valve  in a game last week. Nichol was hospitalized last weekend for observation and  was released early this week. He was on the sidelines for Friday night's 17-14  victory over Orange Lutheran.  </P></p>

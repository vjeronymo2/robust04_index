			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / Recycling goals 'could be meaningless' Government targets on recycling packaging could be meaningless unless a consistent system for defining waste is devised, packaging companies warn. The industry is trying to draw up proposals for recycling waste packaging before the government imposes targets. Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, has told industrialists to find ways of recycling between 50 per cent and 75 per cent of packaging waste by the year 2000. Responses to the industry's proposals for financing a scheme to recycle packaging are due by Wednesday. The responses will be assessed by Sir Sydney Lipworth, the former chairman of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. He has been appointed to advise on the scheme by the Producer Responsibility Group, a group of 28 leading companies formed to draw up proposals. Industrialists have pointed out the difficulties in measuring volumes of waste. Mr James Devereux of Incpen, the packaging trade association, said: 'We don't know how much (packaging) comes into the system at the beginning, how much comes out as waste, and we don't know how much is lost in the middle.' According to Mr Lindsay Fortune, environmental affairs co-ordinator at Courtaulds, the textile group, and deputy chairman of Incpen, different definitions of waste are used for different types of packaging. In papermaking, trimmings from rolls of paper, which are sent back to the mills for re-use, are counted as recycled paper. Yet in some plastics manufacturing, only waste collected from consumers is counted as recycled. The industry also criticises the emphasis given by politicians to recycling household waste, which makes up only about 20m tonnes a year out of the total  - excluding that from farms, mines and quarries  - of 140m tonnes. The National Association of Waste Disposal Contractors believes that 'recycling makes people feel good', but the industry argues that recycling most types of domestic waste uses more energy and chemicals than it saves, and is expensive. The association says recycling aluminium cans and metals, and some paper and glass from household dustbins can be environmentally and financially worthwhile. But recycling plastics and paper is difficult because of the variety of materials and contamination with food.</p>

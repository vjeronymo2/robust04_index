			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Management: Quick bite for lunch when you're Russian - Leyla Boulton continues our series on the art of business entertaining Gogol, the great 19th century writer, combined descriptions of elaborate Russian cuisine with a satire of Russian traditions such as its bureaucracy. Business entertaining in modern Russia runs along similar lines. In the latest innovation of the Russian tax inspector - as absurd as the content of Gogol's play, The Government Inspector - you can only set entertaining expenses against your tax bill if your guest signs a statement naming his company and confirming that you fed him on business. This is partly to do with the fact that despite a big increase over the past few years of decent places to eat out in Moscow, business lunching remains a concept imported from the west. As Russia switches back to capitalism after seven decades of communism, a lot of the power lunching in Moscow is still done with or between foreigners. The older generation Russians are more used to the old system where the main official entertaining was done by state trading and industrial organisations at long banquet tables. At such banquets, which are held increasingly by new-style businessmen, the vodka flows freely, endless toasts are proposed and business deals are elaborated in strolls out in the corridor. But the old guard is by no means averse to being taken out for a tete-a-tete lunch or supper. A modicum of tact, however, is required, particularly if the invitation is being extended to Russian officials by foreign women in a country where notions of male gallantry are still very conservative: women can do the heaviest jobs but are not supposed to carry heavy objects or pick up tabs. At the other end of the scale, western-orientated 'yuppies' in government and business will tell you they are too busy to sacrifice two hours in the middle of the day to be softened up. 'You foreigners like going out to lunch, but can't you just stop by the office to tell me what you want,' is the response I have heard more than once. One restaurant that tries to cater for such attitudes and still pull in customers is the Marco Polo which advertises 40-minute business lunches for Dollars 18 (Pounds 10) a head. The basically alien nature of business lunches is underlined by the fact that most of the new restaurants are joint ventures with foreign partners or Russian restaurants which charge hard currency. Some of the most prestigious and expensive establishments are attached to hotels managed with foreign participation, like the Savoy or Metropol, where a three course meal with wine will cost at least Dollars 100 per person. Purely Russian establishments like the Traktir Arcadia, which offers decent food and drink in roubles for a tenth of the price charged at the Metropol across the road, are still few and far between. The Kropotkin 36, the first private, Russian-owned restaurant in Moscow and still a favourite for its quiet atmosphere and good service, will be more expensive, costing upwards of Dollars 30 a head. In an illustration of just how open Russia is to a mish-mash of western influences, American-style breakfasts are also catching on - ranging from the Germanic buffet at the Penta Hotel (Dollars 25 per person) to the lovely setting of the Metropol breakfast room (Dollars 35).</p>

			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Harmony calls for rejection of rebels HARMONY LEISURE, the loss-making pubs and restaurants group, yesterday launched a fierce attack on rebel shareholders who are seeking an extraordinary meeting to oust the company's executive directors. Urging investors to reject the proposals, Harmony said the leaders of the dissident group had misled shareholders about their former directorships and offered no concrete plans for reviving the company. 'They have been less than candid in their own descriptions and somewhat economical with the truth,' said Mr Robert Dawson, non-executive chairman. According to Harmony, rebel leader Mr Andrew Martyr - who claims the backing of 30 per cent of the shareholders - had never been on the board of Holiday Inns International, although he listed the company among his directorships when he first asked shareholders for support. Mr Dawson also suggested that Harmony's bankers could withdraw their backing if the rebel moves were approved. The company's annual accounts, published earlier this month, were qualified after bankers demanded a substantial reduction in overdrafts and loans. Barclays is understood to be seeking a six figure debt reduction. Harmony's pre-tax loss rose 70 per cent to Pounds 3.68m on turnover of Pounds 6.44m in the 52 weeks ended March 29. Notifying shareholders of an extraordinary general meeting on November 26, Mr Dawson said the company was 'actively examining alternatives which include improving the quality of Harmony's assets within a larger grouping. This should improve shareholder value over time and be reflected by a higher share price'.</p>

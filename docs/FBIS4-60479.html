			<p>BFN     [Text] The Atomic Energy Regulatory Board, AERB, has  ordered the suspension of all construction work of the inner  container structures of the proposed nuclear reactors in  Karnataka and Rajasthan. The AERB order was issued following  preliminary analysis of the collapse of a large concrete portion  of the inner container dome in the (Kaiga) unit-one project in  Karnataka. The board has decided to review the construction  procedure in use. The AERB chairman, Dr. A. Gopalakrishanan,  has said that a high-level expert committee has been constituted  to probe into the incident. He clarified that the (Kaiga)  project is still under construction, and no nuclear fuel or  heavy water has been transferred to the site. As such, there is  no question of any radioactive release or radiological impact  due to the incident, he added.</p>

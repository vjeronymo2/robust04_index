[passage omitted]    After reviewing the achievements scored by the province in  reform, opening up, and economic construction last year, Sun  Weiben said: 1994 is a year critical to the invigoration and  development of Heilongjiang. This year, the economic structural  reform begins to enter the most difficult stage of pressing  ahead comprehensively and making breakthroughs in key areas, and  economic construction is at the critical period of readjusting  structure and improving efficiency. During this new year, we  should accelerate the pace of building the socialist market  economic structure and the pace of developing the productive  forces of the countryside and the county economy in an effort to  further expand the scale of opening up. During this new year,  we should actually build the socialist spiritual civilization,  build the party, and build democracy and the legal system so as  to create a fine legal system environment for reform and  development.    Sun Weiben emphatically pointed out: During this new year,  we should do more good and practical deeds for the masses.  Based on developing the economy, we should strive to increase  the practical income of urban and rural residents, strictly  control the increase margin of commodity prices, improve the  people's living standards and living quality, show concern for  the masses' weal and woe, and adopt all effective measures to  make appropriate arrangements for the livelihood of the people  in poverty-stricken areas and the livelihood of the workers and  staff of the enterprises that have been closed down, suspended  production, and gone bankrupt. We should actively press ahead  the housing system reform and seek to basically solve the  housing problems for the households with special difficulties by  the end of this year. We should maintain close ties between the  party and the people and consolidate and develop political  stability and unity.    Sun Weiben said in conclusion: In this new year,  opportunities and challenges coexist, difficulties and hopes  coexist, the burdens on our shoulders are even more heavy, and  our tasks are even more arduous. To fulfill the tasks on  reform, development, and stability, we must depend on the  concerted efforts of party and government organizations at all  levels, all economic organizations, all military organizations,  and all institutions in the province. At the same time, the vast  numbers of party members and cadres and the people of all  nationalities on all circles should unite as one and strive for  development towards a same goal. Under the guidance of Comrade  Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics, we should closely rally around the CPC Central  Committee, with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the nucleus, and work  hard with one heart and one mind to push forward the province's  reform and construction.</p>

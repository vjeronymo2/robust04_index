			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Nobo more than doubled at Pounds 965,000 Nobo Group, the office and business products supplier, reported more than doubled pre-tax profits for the six months to October 31 in 'difficult trading conditions'. Pre-tax profits were Pounds 965,000 (Pounds 403,000) on turnover of Pounds 10.6m (Pounds 10.2m). The improvement was boosted by the restating of the comparable figure for FRS 3. Turnover, adjusted for the effects of the sale of Budgie Office Products and the purchase of Elite Optics, a maker of overhead projectors, advanced by 5 per cent. Earnings per share came out at 5.55p (2.05p) and the interim dividend is raised from 1.5p to 2p.</p>

			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Sport: In pursuit of perfection - Golf You would have thought that Jose-Maria Olazabal would have been happy with his lot after reducing one of Britain's most difficult tests of golf to just 65 shots to win the recent Volvo PGA Championship at Wentworth. He was not. The Masters champion had said before the event that he was struggling with his swing and nothing had happened over the 72 holes to persuade him to change his mind. Golfers are notorious perfectionists, rarely acknowledging that everything has gone right. Colin Montgomerie tells of the lengths to which the perfectionists will go. He was partnering Bernhard Langer in a foursomes match in the 1991 Ryder Cup, and the Scot's drive had finished in the middle of the fairway. 'How far to the flag?' Langer had asked Montgomerie. 'It is 172 yards from the sprinkler head,' he replied, to which Langer said, in all seriousness: 'Is that measurement from the front of the sprinkler head or the back?' Perhaps the most public acknowledgement of perfection came in the 1980 Open at Royal Lytham and St Annes when the winner Severiano Ballesteros, shot 65 in the final round to win by a stroke from Nick Price. 'Only once every 25 or 30 years does a player get to play that well,' Ballesteros said afterwards, and much of his form since has borne out that statement. There are, however, two rounds of golf broadly considered to be on the highest plane. Both were played in major championships and both were played on courses that will be hosting majors this year. One was Greg Norman's 63 at Turnberry in the 1986 Open, which is where the event will return next month. The other was Johnny Miller's 63 in the final round of the 1973 US Open at Oakmont, which will host next week's US Open. Oakmont is a typical US Open course - and then some. The fairways are narrow, the rough is long and the greens are small and ridiculously quick. 'Three putting isn't a possibility there, it's an achievement,' one player wryly recalled. Oakmont is made for perfectionists, because if it is so hard on the players then it follows that it must suit those who are most hard on themselves. This year, the United States Golf Association has finally recognised that the world is a large place, and there will be 16 Europeans taking part. Contrast that with the miserly half dozen who received invitations as recently as five years ago. Nobody from Europe has won this title since Tony Jacklin crossed the Atlantic as the sole representative from the continent in 1970 and completed a rare double, the Open and the US Open in a 12-month span. If a European is to win this year, it will be a familiar name: look to Langer, Olazabal, Montgomerie, but most of all to Nick Faldo, who now regards this championship as his number one priority. He is at Oakmont already: most of the players will not arrive there until Tuesday, five days later. But a perfectionist can never be too early.</p>

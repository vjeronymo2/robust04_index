			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / Arts: Just avoid 'Swan Lake' at all costs - Dance Looking forward into the year's dance, does not, alas, imply looking forward to it. Much looks predictable, and I cite only those dates that seem to be worth a diary entry. Please note that Irek Mukhamedov joins forces with Kim Brandstrup's Arc Dance troupe for a bold venture at Sadler's Wells (February 9 - 12) when he will appear in a new Othello that Brandstrup is to make for him. Other Wells events include a 'Spanish season' in March with Cristina Hoyos and then the Compania Nacional de Danza in two programmes by Nacho Duarto. At Covent Garden, Mayerling will be revived at the end of January, and again in March for two performances with Mukhamedov and Michael Nunn - both admirable as Archduke Rudolf. Birmingham Royal Ballet will come to Covent Garden in March/April with a triple bill including a new acquisition, Fall River Legend, Agnes de Mille's jolly old barnstormer about Lizzie Borden ('You can't chop your Momma up in Massachusetts, And then blame all the damage on the mice]'). Lizzie should turn her axe on the company's lamentable new Sylvia. If you are in Paris in February, the Opera Garnier will present a fascinating Nijinsky programme which includes a 'reconstruction' (optimistic term) of Nijinsky's Tyl Eulenspiegel, last seen for a handful of performances in New York in 1916, together with the 'reconstruction' of his Rite of Spring. In March the Palais Garnier will also show a triple bill of brand new works by Roland Petit - good news - and in July the San Francisco Ballet will appear there with two programmes. Meantime in New York, New York City Ballet will have its April/June season at the State Theater, and American Ballet Theatre will presumably pay its traditional visit to the Met in that annual across-the-Plaza rivalry with NYCB. Good news from the Edinburgh Festival is that both Mark Morris and Merce Cunningham's troupes will be on offer with a large repertory. London ballet dates are unknown, though English National Ballet will play a week at the Coliseum (with its new Sleeping Beauty) and then on to the Festival Hall with Beauty and Coppelia. One other thing is sure: somewhere, someone is going to rush in with Swan Lake. I remember in New York one lunch-time a decade ago finding the NY Post front page devoted to a traffic-stopping head-line of just eight letters: Pope Shot. I'm not at all sure nowadays whether Swan Lake's eight letters are not more calculated to strike terror into the heart.</p>

			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Magma to go ahead with Nevada gold/copper mine Nevada is to have another copper-gold mine. Magma Copper, the Tucson-based group, yesterday gave the go-ahead for its USDollars 300m Robinson mine near Ely in the middle of the State. Robinson is scheduled to start up in January, 1996, and will produce 135m lb (61,252 tonnes) a year of copper, 110,000 troy ounces of gold and 325,000 troy ounces of silver for 16 years, said Mr Burgess Winter, Magma's president. Life-of-mine cash operating costs would be 50 cents a pound (Dollars 1,102 a tonne) but only 46 cents (Dollars 1,014) in the early years. Only a week ago Magma, with a bid of about USDollars 250m, won the closely-contested auction for Tintaya, Peru's second-largest copper mine, which was sold by the government as part of its privatisation process. Mr Winter said at a meeting in London with the Association of Mining Analysts that the combination of Tintaya and Robinson made achievable Magma's target of producing 750m lb of copper a year at a cost below 50 cents a pound by the end of 1996 and gave it a good base for its long-term objective of producing 1bn lb at below 50 cents by the year 2000. Robinson was until the late 1970s mined by Kennecott, the US company now part of RTZ, but was closed down because of high costs and the need for substantial capital investment. Kennecott sold the entire area to Alta Gold, a 'junior' company. for Dollars 20m after a court dispute and Magma paid Dollars 58m to take it over gradually from Alta. Mr Winter said the mine needed a new tailings (waste) dam and concentrator plant. The three existing open pits had substantial reserves around them - 252m tonnes containing 2.1bn lb of recoverable copper and 1.8m ounces of gold - and there was considerable potential to increase these reserves. Magma had hoped to bring Robinson into production in late 1994 but was delayed by an environmental impact statement by the Nevada Bureau of Land Management. The Bureau approved the operating plan on September 9 and the 30-day appeal period expired this week. The copper market might face some years of oversupply before the end of the decade, warned Mr Juan Villarzu, president of Codelco, Chile's state-owned group. He pointed out that Chile's copper production was expected to nearly double from 2.2m tonnes to about 4m tonnes by the year 2000.</p>

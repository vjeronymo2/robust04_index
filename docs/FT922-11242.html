			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / Economics: Contradictory messages about the strength of recovery in the US THE FOCUS shifts to the US this week where a welter of statistics will be scrutinised for evidence of economic recovery. Few would dispute that it is taking place,but recent data has failed to cast much light on how strongly. Mr Mark Cliffe, an economist at Nomura Research Institute in London, warns that, although this week's release of the advance estimates of gross domestic product for the first quarter will provide some indication of the strength of the recovery, the contradictory message of its constituents will leave room for a wide range of estimates for the second quarter. The contradictory messages cited by Mr Cliffe include the retail sales component of consumer spending, which rose by a sharp annualised gain of 9.2 per cent on the previous quarter, and industrial production, which showed a quarter-on-quarter fall of 4.3 per cent. Highlights of the week ahead, with median forecasts in brackets from MMS International, a financial information company include: Today: US, March existing home sales; Japan, March retail sales (down 0.1 per cent on year); Australia, March motor vehicle registrations (up 3 per cent); Canada, February employment earnings; UK, first sitting of newly elected parliament.

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] To celebrate 27 April Day, the immortal day of  democracy in the life and history of our people [first  anniversary of first legislative elections in Yemen], a grand  popular speech rally was held today in 70 Square in Sanaa, the  capital of the revolution and the unity. [passage omitted]    Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih,  Presidential  Council chairman, attended the grand popular speech rally. He  delivered an important national speech. [passage omitted]    Addressing the large crowd in 70 Square, the brother  chairman  said: You should arm yourselves with awareness. I had wished  that the rest of the political parties would participate in the  democratic framework. Some of these parties had acquired more  than their true size. However, they knew their place on 27  April and each political party knew its true size. The masses  said their word and were above all parties, and above all those  who seek to extend their hands abroad. The loyalty of the  masses was for God, the homeland, the revolution, democracy, and  unity. The masses spoke clearly: No to sectarianism,  regionalism, and racism; no to the elements of sabotage and  destruction. All those who seek to sabotage national unity and  disunite national ranks will pay a heavy price. Each citizen of  our people will turn into a judge, court president, and attorney  general in the name of the Yemeni people to try all those who  harm this homeland and this nation. Also, our Armed Forces  today represent [words indistinct] the homeland and the shield  of 22 May. They are also the protectors of unity and democracy.    The brother chairman called on the masses of our Yemeni  people to form committees in all the governorates, districts,  and neighborhoods, to defend unity and democracy and oppose the  elements of sabotage wherever they exist.    The brother chairman cited a political statement by the  spokesman of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] to the effect that  the accord document cannot be accepted and that it is not  possible to return to pre-22 May 1990 and after [date  indistinct] 1993. He means by this canceling 22 May. However,  there are people who have remained faithful to their pledge to  God and who keep to unity and democracy. Unity and democracy are  the property of the entire Yemeni people, who can protect them,  since they are not the property of a political party or leader  who claims guardianship over any governorate of the republic.  The parties should be national parties and should extend over  the entire Yemeni arena, from Sa'dah to al-Maharah and to  Hadhdramaut, Aden, Ta'izz, and other governorates of the Yemeni  republic. Our people reject, and will not accept, regional  parties. These parties are rejected.    The brother chairman called on the House of Representatives  to assume its historic responsibilities. He added that there is  apparent circumvention to abort the [Dialogue] Committee. We  had wished that the Dialogue Committee would be fair and  unbiased and that it would side with justice against falsehood.  Regrettably, however, the Dialogue Committee ordered all  members of the Presidential Council to get together and this did  not happen, but it did not dare condemn the party that violated  its decisions.    He noted that the accord document stipulated two major  points. First, arresting the subversive elements. However, the  YSP is today allying with these elements and is supplying them  with tools of sabotage. Second, moving the military units from  the pre-unity positions to the center of Yemen in line with the  document. However, this has not happened and we did not hear any  voice from our brothers and colleagues in the Political Forces  Dialogue Committee regarding this conduct. [passage omitted]    The brother chairman added that 27 April shall remain the  cultural plan of the Yemeni republic. It is an object of  admiration and appreciation of the world. We assert to those  who attempt to fragment our national unity that we, here, shall  maintain our steadfastness and defend the revolution, the  republic, and the unity. There can be no alternative to the  revolution, the republic, unity and democracy, whatever the  price. [passage omitted]</p>

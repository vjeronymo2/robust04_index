			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei below 17,000 in low volume ARBITRAGE-LINKED selling drove shares lower yesterday, leaving the Nikkei average closing below 17,000 for the first time since April 9, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The average lost 284.03 at 16,787.33, after a day's high of 17,124.55 and low of 16,682.86. Monday's fall on Wall Street also depressed sentiment. Volume picked up modestly from 200m shares to 250m. Falls outscored rises by 712 to 240, with 162 issues unaltered. The Topix index of all first section shares slipped 12.49 to 1,280.20, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index edged up 0.35 to 1,039.06. Trading remained dominated by index-linked activity, as the fall in the futures markets prompted arbitrageurs to unwind positions. Small-lot selling of stocks bought on margin six months ago added to the decline. Traders said buy orders placed at lower levels by some pension funds and life assur-ers failed to lift sentiment. Mr Masami Okuma at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew said domestic investors were hoping that foreigners would return now that the Easter break was over. Bio-technology issues, which were actively traded on margin last October, lost ground on margin unwinding by individuals. But some short-term traders sought speculative stocks, Morinaga Milk gaining Y9 to Y726 and Okamoto Industries Y40 to Y1,130. Bank shares were lower, with Industrial Bank of Japan down Y60 to Y1,670 and Fuji Bank off Y50 at Y1,260. Most analysts believe that asset-backed stocks need to fall further before investors regain confidence in them. Industrial blue chips were firm. Sony put on Y30 to Y4,150. Mr Barry Dargan, electrical analyst at James Capel, said international blue chips looked cheap by international valuation standards. Department stores fell on prospects of lower earnings, after sharp drops in March department store sales for the Tokyo and Osaka districts were announced. Mitsukoshi shed Y42 to Y832 on reports of expected losses for the financial year to February. Tokyu Department Store fell Y43 to a low for the year of Y540. In Osaka, the OSE average declined 216.45 to 19,213.53 in volume of 10m shares. Institutional investors and some foreigners were seen bargain hunting, but overall activity remained subdued. Roundup WEAKNESS in Tokyo and on Wall Street weighed on the Pacific Rim yesterday. Indian brokers continued to boycott trading in Bombay. AUSTRALIA ended slightly lower in thin trading, the All Ordinaries index losing 2.0 at 1,588.0 in turnover of ADollars 136.4m. Among the bright spots, QBE, ADollars 6.20, and Lend Lease, ADollars 15.40, gained 20 cents apiece after their joint purchase of Australian Eagle Insurance. BTR Nylex rose 7 cents to ADollars 2.61 after Westinghouse Brake and Signal advised shareholders to accept its offer. BANGKOK closed at an eight-month low as protests against the appointment of an unelected prime minister intensified. The SET index fell 23.75 or 2.9 per cent to 785.09. NEW ZEALAND recovered from a weak start, the NZSE index finishing 0.85 up at 1,411.54 in turnover of NZDollars 15.6m. The listing of Australian Consolidated Press was not well received. No shares were traded in its first day on the exchange. HONG KONG ended below the day's best after cautious trading. The Hang Seng index gained a net 10.40 at 5,093.09 and turnover contracted to HKDollars 2.45bn from HKDollars 3.17bn. HSBC Holdings came under selling pressure, and brokers noted some switching from HSBC into Hang Seng Bank and Bank of East Asia. MANILA lost ground on concern about threats by army rebels to attempt a fresh coup ahead of the May 11 elections. The composite index receded 4.68 to 1,171.54 in combined turnover of 191.9m pesos, after a previous 172.2m pesos.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Dmitiry Gorokhov and </F> Yuriy Kozlov]    [Text] Moscow, 17 Jun -- Qian Qichen, PRC State Council  vice premier and foreign minister, will within the next few days  visit the Russian capital. Andrey Kozyrev informed State Duma  deputies of this on Friday.    Asked at what level and with what effectiveness the  situation  concerning the Korean Peninsula is being discussed with Beijing,  the Russian foreign minister said in particular, that there is a  regular exchange of views. Over the past two years alone the  head of Russia's foreign policy department "has had five or six  meetings with the PRC foreign minister, and on each occasion  this problem was discussed."    "Like Russia," A. Kozyrev said, "China is also definitely  against the DPRK breaking with the nuclear nonproliferation  regime and in favor of a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula. In  other words, it favors neither one of the Korean states  possessing or taking steps to possess nuclear weapons."  According to the minister "this is the fundamental basis of the  coincidence and fundamental closeness of the approaches of  Russia and the PRC." Of course, he went on to say, there are  nuances of detail and tactics, but in the main the positions of  the two countries coincide.</p>

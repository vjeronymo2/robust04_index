			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Pressac checked by redundancy payments WITHOUT redundancy payments and associated costs, Pressac Holdings, the Nottingham-based volume manufacturer of automotive, telecommunications and lighting components would have achieved an 11 per cent advance in profitability. However, exceptional items of Pounds 177,000 left pre-tax profits for the year to July 31 1992 virtually unchanged at Pounds 1.84m compared with Pounds 1.82m for the preceding year. Mr Roger Boissier, chairman, said the group had reacted well to severe market conditions which had been 'particularly appalling' in the UK. The group had continued to improve productivity and had been successful in gaining market share which would generate growth. New products being launched this year included a range of RAST 5 connector systems for the domestic appliance market and a range of insulation displacement connectors and privacy adaptors for video telephones. The balance sheet remained strong with year-end gearing at 24 per cent after allowing for the continuing high level of capital investment in improved manufacturing which absorbed Pounds 3.7m during the year. Turnover declined from Pounds 34.5m to Pounds 33.7m with 41 per cent (42 per cent) of sales exported. A final dividend of 1.65p maintains the total at 2.4p from earnings of 4.7p (5.8p) per share.</p>

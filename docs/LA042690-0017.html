			<p><P> April 26, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> RESTAURANT REVIEW MEXICAN;  </P> <P> CASA DE SEVILLA'S FRIENDS STILL CALL IT PETE'S PLACE  </P> <P> If it's a restaurant with a name such as Casa de Sevilla, it's got to be  Mexican or Spanish. Right?  </P> <P> Especially if it's in a less-than-distinctive neighborhood . . . across the  street from the Salvation Army.  </P> <P> But as anyone who's spent any time in Santa Barbara knows, Casa de Sevilla is  no run-of-the-mill Mexican restaurant.  </P> <P> It is the longtime home of the Old Guard where steaks and chops and seafood  make up the house cuisine. And it may be the only place on the South Coast  where there is an "A" room: the red one to the right. (The small, added-on  porch areas, with tables by the fireplace, are actually the most intimate  tables.) It's also the kind of restaurant in which you almost always overhear  the phrase, "My Dad used to take me here when I was a kid."  </P> <P> Walking into Casa de Sevilla, you find yourself in the midst of a bunch of  dressy blue blazers. These are people from affluent places such as Montecito,  Hope Ranch and Ojai who've been coming here for 50 years. And leaning against  the bar might be Howard Duff or John Ireland or other members of the local  movie contingent.  </P> <P> But the blue blazers haven't really come to the Casa de Sevilla. They've come  to Pete's. Although Pete hasn't owned the place for 33 years, it's still Pete's  to many of its customers. Butch and Birgitta have owned it for the last 27  years.  </P> <P> Is it too soon to begin calling it Butch's?  </P> <P> Not much has changed over the years in decor or menu. The prices, of course,  have kept up with the times. And recently, the bullfight posters that have  always been on the walls were restored.  </P> <P> It is true that the most popular appetizer, the chile con queso, is Mexican --  almost a chile relleno, but not quite (the pepper seeds are removed). Gazpacho  and ceviche are also among the appetizers, and you can order enchiladas or  poached chicken in Spanish sauce. Stick to these dishes and you'll eat well for  about $12 to $15 a person.  </P> <P> For spareribs or a veal chop, you'll pay more -- about $22 and $23. But the  meat is barbecued to order, very simply, and the choice pork back ribs are done  in a light, distinctive sauce.  </P> <P> More than meat, however, the restaurant quite properly puts its main emphasis  on seafood. There is probably no place on the South Coast where I've found  better fish. Or, for that matter, fish as well-prepared.  </P> <P> The abalone, which in these days of shellfish inflation can completely distort  one's bill, is lightly breaded and sauteed. It's $30 and enormously popular,  which is interesting, since it costs nearly double most of the other seafood  entrees.  </P> <P> Fresh fish is grilled very simply -- and it's not overcooked. Portions are  generous, but you never know whether the catch will be thick or thin. Butch  says it all depends on how the fish are coming in. You may get an inch-thick  swordfish ($16) or a soft, flaky barbecued salmon ($15). A vegetable and a  salad are included (but don't get excited about the salad).  </P> <P> Perhaps the longevity of the waitresses (no serving men in these rooms) is an  indication of how good the service is. Leona, for instance, has been at the  restaurant 14 years.  </P> <P> But Helen, who retired several years ago, had been around for 56 years!  </P> <P> This is one of the last Bastions of Empire and it still does a fine job.  </P> <P>  Casa de Sevilla, 428 Chapala St., Santa Barbara. (805) 966-4370. Open Tuesday  through Saturday for lunch noon to 2 p.m.; dinner 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. Full bar,  reservations accepted. Major credit cards accepted. Dinner for two, food only,  $32-$50.  </P></p>

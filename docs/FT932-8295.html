			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Survey of Chile (10): Pinochet's influence lingers on - The politico-military relationship They say that old soldiers never die. In General Pinochet's case, neither is he prepared to fade away. Chile's former dictator, now 77 and fitted with a pace-maker, granted himself the constitutional right to head the army until 1998. He has not expressed any wish to take early retirement. Gen Pinochet has three main reasons for wanting to remain commander in chief of the army: Rightly or wrongly, he regards himself as the guardian of Chile's peaceful transition to democracy. He is the army's main insurance policy against the threat of human rights trials. And, having modernised the Chilean economy, the general still has one unfulfilled ambition: to go down in history as the man who also modernised the largest and most cumbersome branch of the Chilean armed forces. For while the navy and air force effectively withdrew from government during the last years of military rule, the army's best cadres were busy running state bureaucracies and the ubiquitous security apparatus. As a result, the 60,000-strong army (it includes 30,000 conscripts) finds itself far behind its sister branches in preparing for the challenges of the 21st century. Pay is poor; the army has forged few links with military academies abroad; and Gen Pinochet's intense dislike of the US has led to logistical problems in the search for non-American arms suppliers. President Aylwin's 'cohabitation' with the former dictator has not been easy, but he has handled it with considerable skill and no small measure of restraint. The president's boldest initiative was to commission an independent report, published in March 1991, on the human rights abuses committed during Gen Pinochet's rule. The report stopped short of naming those responsible for the repression, but it provided moral reparation for the victims and their families. The army rejected the report's findings, frustrating President Aylwin's efforts to heal the wounds of the past. Nevertheless, the government has not pursued human rights trials. Only a handful of cases, which fall outside a 1978 self-amnesty decreed by the military, are being pursued through the courts. As the human rights legacy has diminished in importance, other issues concerning the role of the military in a democracy have taken centre stage. Spying on politicians caused a scandal last year which highlighted the government's impotence in dealing with the army intelligence services; they remain beyond civilian control. Earlier this year the government failed to muster sufficient support in congress for a constitutional amendment that would restore the president's power to dismiss military commanders. The amendment was blocked by the right-wing opposition. The government's defeat was yet another example of how Gen Pinochet continues to exert an influence over domestic politics long after relinquishing power to civilians. Nevertheless, these public battles have obscured the extent to which progress is being made in bridging the chasm of distrust that separates civilians and men in uniform. This year, for the first time, 20 civilians will be graduating with a master's degree in defence studies from the Chilean War Academy. 'It has been an invaluable forum for discussion, to get to know their way of thinking,' says Mr Hugo Espinoza, a left-wing sociologist who was expelled from the military-controlled universities during Gen Pinochet's rule. Mr Espinoza also sees progress in the military's relations with congress. 'Their greatest fear was that politicians would meddle in military affairs,' he explains. After a tense first year, the armed forces now send their top brass to parliamentary defence committees to explain and account for military expenditures. The navy and air force have made a special point of inviting senators and deputies on inspections and military manoeuvres. Despite greater accountability, military expenditure remains high for a country with no border conflicts. The military budget consumes 15 per cent of the government's income - about 4.5 per cent of GDP. In per capita terms, Chile has the highest military expenditure on the continent, excepting Cuba. Few Chileans feel bold enough yet to question the cost of their armed forces, let alone their efficiency. These troublesome issues have been left for a future government to tackle. President Aylwin's main aim during this transitional four-year government has been to establish a modus vivendi with Chile's former masters. Mr Aylwin now says he has grown accustomed to the general. The military, for its part, has come to accept the legitimacy of democracy. No one in Chile fears another military coup.</p>

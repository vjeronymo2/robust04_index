			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / Survey of Spain (7): Homage to Catalonia - Barcelona awaits the Games IT WOULD not be the Olympic Games without a last minute panic and Barcelona's panic has, not surprisingly, been about accommodation. In spite of spending some Dollars 1.5bn on creating housing for athletes, umpires and the media for this summer's Games, the sudden creation of new nations in Eastern Europe and the re-entry to the Olympics of South Africa has sent officials scurrying for available apartments and hotels. There will not be many, even though many locals will probably leave town for the duration of the Games to watch them from some cool Balearic island on the television. When they come back, though, what a treat awaits them. The build-up to the Games will have seen some Dollars 8.5bn of public and private capital pumped in to Barcelona. The city, already an impressive architectural monument to the modernist genius of its early 20th century fathers, has become arguably the most modern city on the Mediterranean. Just for a start, a Dollars 2bn new beltway system will probably take about 20 per cent of traffic off Barcelona's choking streets and help ease the city's most chronic problem. But, says Enric Truno, the city councillor who has prepared the Catalan capital for the Games, they mean much more than revitalising a sagging infrastructure. 'We want these Games to be different,' he says. 'We want them to show not just that we are hospitable and warm but also to break the notion that we are chaotic and lazy.' Rather like Seville and its Expo '92 further south, Barcelona and Catalonia have approached the Games as a unique opportunity to show themselves off to visitors and particularly visitors who might one day become investors. The region may be Spain's most economically robust but it is being challenged for that leadership by Madrid and sees the Dollars 10bn pumped in to Andalucia and Seville for the Expo as a threat. Catalonia and Barcelona are to Spain what Baden-Wurttemburg and Stuttgart are to Germany - places were things, including the people, work best of all. Even in early April, guides were telling visitors to the Olympic city that everything was practically ready for the Games while in Seville, the Expo was forced to open with half a dozen of its pavilions still under construction and access to the site still partly blocked by construction. The Catalans will move heaven and earth not to be cast in the same mould when the 11,000 journalists and media technicians begin to pour into Barcelona in July. They will probably get it right, but one wonders what Barcelona will be like after the Games are over. It is a strange city, desperately trying to live its life away from embarrassing, crude, Spain. It has become precious and sort of untouchable, like an exhibit. Its citizens clamber to speak Catalan to each other, using up mental capacity on a language no-one else will ever bother to learn but which is not quite obscure enough (like Basque) to guarantee the exoticism Catalonia so craves. A city famous for its artists and architects has decided once again that it should be the design centre of Spain but has never made the link between form and function central to all good design and which the modernists were true to. Nowadays everything, from paper cups to public walkways, is designed and overdesigned. It would be nice if something spontaneous or ordinary happened. The Olympics will, no doubt, test Barcelona's capacity to improvise. The city tried unsuccessfully to host Olympics in 1924, 1936 and 1972 and now the new hotels, oversized airport, beltways, subways and railway stations the Games have brought are bound to increase the city's confidence. They may even calm the twitch that drives Barcelona to try constantly to be different. One thing will definitely help Barcelona to mellow. After decades of trying to pretend it was nowhere near the Mediterranean by building factories between the centre of town and the water, the Olympics have given the city back its beach, about five kilometres of it just in front of the Dollars 1bn Olympic village and its flashy new marina. When the locals come back to town after the Games, the beach is where they will probably go. It will be hot then and probably a good time to switch off Gaudi and Dali and Picasso and get in some serious tanning.</p>

			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Commission warns Japan over trade imbalance THE European Commission yesterday warned Japanese ministers that political co-operation between the EC and Japan would be undermined by a failure to improve the two partners' bilateral trade imbalance. The Japanese responded by suggesting Community businesses should try harder to penetrate the Japanese market. Mr Hans van den Broek, the new commissioner for external relations, and Sir Leon Brittan, who has taken over the trade portfolio, led a team of commissioners meeting five senior Japanese ministers in Brussels. The meeting was the culmination of two days of talks on political and economic relations, at which Mr Michio Watanabe, the Japanese foreign minister, and his colleagues promised to implement measures aimed at encouraging EC exports and investment in Japan. Japan has been eager to develop its political relations with the EC since signing a joint co-operation declaration in 1991. But tension between the two blocs has been exacerbated by Japan's growing surplus on trade with the Community, which rose more than 17 per cent in the first 11 months of 1992 to Dollars 29.2bn (Pounds 19.2bn). The Commission claimed yesterday that Japan and the EC had taken the first step towards systematic analysis of the trade surplus, by arranging a meeting of experts to discuss the figures before April. Brussels believes regular monitoring of the statistics will enable both sides to spot areas where EC exports appear to be hampered. But Mr Seiji Morimoto, spokesman for Mr Watanabe, said that although there was general agreement on the principle of such monitoring, the details had to be worked out. He said Japan believed regular analysis would demonstrate that the trade surplus was often distorted by currency fluctuation and price changes. The two sides also touched on the sensitive issue of Japanese car exports to the EC. Publicly, both the Commission and the Japanese claimed to be happy with the memorandum of understanding signed in 1991, under which Japan 'monitors' its exports to the Community. But a row is already brewing about the likely increase in Japanese exports during 1993, when the EC car market is expected to shrink.</p>

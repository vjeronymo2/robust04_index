			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / Foster's writes down UK assets by Pounds 459m Foster's Brewing Group yesterday announced a 35 per cent write-down in the value of its UK assets consisting of Courage, Britain's second largest brewer, and a 50 per cent stake in Inntrepreneur Estates, a pub joint venture with Grand Metropolitan. The Australian group said the ADollars 955m (Pounds 459m) charge was prompted by continued trading difficulties in the UK, a complex regulatory environment, continental European brewers' increasing access to the UK market, and rising take-home sales of lower-margin beers at the expense of sales in pubs. Analysts said the write-down brought the investments broadly in line with book values of other brewers and with GrandMet's valuation of its half of Inntrepreneur. GrandMet had previously written down its stake in several stages while Foster's had maintained the book value. The move, which Foster's announced with a 9 per cent fall in group profits after tax and abnormal financial items for the year to June 30, was seen by analysts as a prelude to further rationalisation at Courage and the possibility of Foster's taking over a large part of Inntrepreneur. GrandMet has previously indicated it would like to concentrate on its other food and drink businesses. Foster's wrote down its Courage brand names by ADollars 385m, goodwill by ADollars 242m, Courage's fixed assets by ADollars 58m and its investment by ADollars 270m. But the Melbourne-based group also announced that it would offset much of the balance sheet damage by writing up the value of its Australian assets, and including a valuation for the Carlton and United brand names. In its 1993 accounts, Foster's did not include a CUB brand valuation but said, in a footnote, that directors considered them to be worth about ADollars 1bn-ADollars 1.2bn. Yesterday, Foster's said it had referred to an independent assessment when deciding the value of the CUB brands but decided to pick a substantially lower figure - ADollars 665m. Foster's reported a 10.3 per cent increase in pre-tax profits at ADollars 308.4m. Sales fell from ADollars 6.49bn to ADollars 5.07bn, largely due to asset sales. It said its three beer markets - Australia, the UK and Canada - were still extremely competitive, and that volumes had declined slightly in the UK and Australia. Canadian volumes were 'modestly higher'. Operating earnings from CUB rose from ADollars 211m to ADollars 250m, with market share climbing to 53 per cent. Pre-interest profits at Courage, by contrast, fell from ADollars 208m to ADollars 174m, a decline exacerbated by the strengthening Australian dollar. The contribution from Molson in Canada fell from ADollars 107m to ADollars 78m. Profits were helped by a drop in interest charges, from ADollars 343.3m to ADollars 214.9m, with debt at June 30 put at ADollars 1.85bn, compared with ADollars 2.64bn. Basic earnings per share were 8.7 cents, against 10.7 cents. The final dividend of 3.25 cents is unchanged. Lex, Page 22</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Global TV News" newscast] </F>   [Text] Congressmen Osvaldo Sandoval and Lourdes Flores  Nano, as well as retired General Sivencio Jarama, today  disagreed with both the law dealing with jurisdiction for  handling the La Cantuta case and the U.S. Government  pronouncement on this issue.    [Begin recording] [Flores Nano] The opposition has filed an  amparo recourse, which will have to go through the normal  proceedings and even be taken to international courts. The  opposition has filed a reconsideration recourse, which still  must be ruled on. The opposition will demand that the  Constitutional Court Law be enacted and, with the people's  support, will take the appropriate legal action to challenge the  decision's constitutionality.    [Sandoval] I would say this communique has been released too  hastily, without first assessing the context of the  circumstances under discussion in the past few days.    [Reporter] According to the communique, the subject is  particularly sensitive regarding the international environment,  which demands a clear investigation. What would you say about  these two words?    [Jarama] I would say we all demand clarity in the  investigation. I think we all agree on the communique's final  remarks. We must reach the conclusion that the current  government's officials are unwilling to create the necessary  mechanisms to consolidate the groundwork for a true democratic  system in the country. I am concerned over how little is being  done on the positive side and how much is being done to destroy  the country's institutionality. [end recording]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vadim Byrkin] </F>   [Text] Stepanakert, 21 May -- Robert Kocharyan, chairman  of the State Committee for the Defence of Nagorno Karabakh, has  said that the Nagorno Karabakh republic and the Crimean republic  intend to "be persistent in implementing the accords reached".  He told a news conference today about the results of the visit  to the Crimean Peninsula by an official Nagorno Karabakh  delegation.    A communique on the results of the meeting has been signed  between the Nagorno Karabakh republic and the Crimean republic,  as well as an agreement on trade and economic and cultural  cooperation.    It is envisaged that there will be an exchange of  representative offices and that privileges will be granted on  transit freight and other things. On the political level, the  sides came to agreement on coordinating actions, and also on  possible joint steps in respect of a political settlement of the  problems facing the two republics. Crimea's President Yuriy  Meshkov may make a visit to Nagorno Karabakh in return.    Evaluating the current situation in Crimea, Robert Kocharyan  commented that this was an attempt by the Ukrainian leadership  to oppose any deepening of Crimean sovereignty. Karabakh has  already passed this stage, and in Robert Kocharyan's view, this  will have a consequence for Crimea and will only strengthen its  sovereignty.</p>

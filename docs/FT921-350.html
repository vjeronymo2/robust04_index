			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / Management: Giving credit where it is due / A look at how a group of retailers are fighting fraud How much use can a tiny organisation with no technology, a staff of two and a budget of only Pounds 85,000 a year, be to retailers and financial institutions in the fight against fraud? Set against the efforts of Kenneth Baker, Britain's Home Secretary, to persuade the clearing banks and building societies to put up tens of millions of pounds to combat fraud, Cifas - the name stands for Credit Industry Fraud Avoidance System - looks puny. The system is the brainchild of a group of retailers and others in the credit lending business who wanted cost-effective ways to beat fraud. Most anti-fraud measures rely on expensive technology inside organisations. But as John McCullough, manager of Sears Card says: 'We realised that companies in the credit business could fight fraud by copying retail traders and exchanging information directly between themselves.' The founders also realised that the most effective way for lenders to fight fraud was to nip it in the bud by spotting fraudsters when they make applications for credit. That is easiest done by tapping information about past frauds. If a credit organisation believes that an applicant has filed false information or impersonated someone, it sends the information to all UK four credit reference agencies - CCN, Equifax, Infolink, and CDMS. Last year, 9,427 fraudulent applications were filed with the credit reference agencies. When the same address comes up in a subsequent application, Cifas members are alerted. The Cifas members must then apply to the organisation which issued the warning and check the facts. There were checks on about 85 per cent of the fraudulent credit applications listed on Cifas last year. What sort of applications generate warnings? Cifas records five categories of suspicious information. A false name at a true address. Impersonation. The successful use of false data to secure credit, like giving an inflated income. The attempted use of false data where credit was not given. The sale of goods like motor vehicles still covered by hire purchase agreements. 'Everyone at Cifas would like to see the police take fraudulent applications more seriously,' says Peter Hurst, credit policy manager at Barclaycard, Cifas' largest member. 'Some police forces argue that because no money was lost, there is no reason why they should investigate it. Others take it very seriously indeed, but there is no national policy among the police.' About one third of frauds are impersonations and protecting the innocent is an important concern. 'The worst that can happen to an innocent party is that their address is on the data base.' says Ken Cherrett, Cifas chairman. In practice, people who have been the victims of impersonation may find that they have to spend slightly longer proving their identity when applying for credit. Some lenders, notably Barclaycard, write and tell customers when their names have been used for an impersonation. Cherrett says that Cifas has demonstrated that a great deal can be achieved very easily by co-operation between retailers to fight fraud. The scheme's original members were mostly retailers and smaller credit institutions, but its 72 members now include all but one of the big high street banks. How effective is it? Barclaycard believes that Cifas membership saves it about Pounds 3m a year in losses from fraud - 1,000 times its annual subscription of Pounds 3,000 to the organisation, although members also have to include the day-to-day cost of participating in the scheme by filing information to the credit reference agencies.</p>

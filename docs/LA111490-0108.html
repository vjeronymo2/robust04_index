But, if Air Force (5-5) loses at Texas El Paso (3-6)  Saturday, and UCLA (5-5) beats USC, the Bruins would land in the Liberty Bowl.  NCAA rules prohibit teams with a losing record from playing a bowl game.  </P> <P> UCLA played in the Liberty Bowl in 1976, losing to Alabama, 36-6, in freezing  weather. MAL FLORENCE  </P></p>

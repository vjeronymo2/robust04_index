			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by George Walden MP, former diplomat in Beijing: </F> "The Governor Has Got It Wrong"]    [Text] Some years ago Mrs Thatcher asked me, as someone  who had lived and worked in Beijing and Hong Kong, whom she  should send as Governor of the colony. Whoever it is, I  replied, don't send a politician. In Hong Kong we are in the  classic British position of having responsibility without power,  and it would be wrong to promise things we are in no position to  deliver.    British policy in Hong Kong today is worse than a failure:  it is immoral. As 1997 approaches, our press and Parliamentary  opinion seem motivated largely by conscience-salving, which  makes rational discussion difficult. The mood of national  escapism has reached the point where to dissent from official  policy is to be branded an agent of a foreign power.  Nevertheless I shall try to dispel some of the myths. Like  garbage disposal, someone has to do lt.    How can defiance of China in the cause of democracy be  immoral? Philosophers have a handy way of deciding these things.  You simply examine the aims, means and consequences of an  action, and see whether they add up. In the case of the attempt  to extend democracy in Hong Kong a few years before China takes  over, the means and the consequences of our actions are so  questionable that the aim itself has become suspect.    The objective might seem above criticism: to give a greater  measure of representative government to a people who, we now  discover should have had it all along. This is the first of the  comforting falsehoods that have dominated the discussion. It  was never possible to have anything approaching a serious  democracy in Hong Kong.    Assume that we had mounted elections, in the teeth of  Chinese  opposition, on what they see as their territory. There would  have been an anti-Beijing Party, and the communists would have  seen to it that they were countered by a pro-Beijing party. The  result, especially at times of crisis on the mainland, would  have been blood on the streets. The murderous riots of 1956 and  1967 were a taste of that. China made it clear years ago that  they would see serious moves to democracy as a prelude to the  independence of a part of their country.    Another myth fashionable amongst escapologists from the  responsibilities of decolonisation is that our policy in Hong  Kong since 1949 has been dictated by "Foreign Office Mandarins."  Leaving aside the question of how the colony has succeeded as  well as it has, this puts successive British prime ministers and  foreign secretaries in a poor light, not least Lady Thatcher.    Was that notoriously weak-willed woman such putty in the  hands of the "mandarins" that she failed to insist on a proper  democracy in Hong Kong as part of the Sino-British agreement?  Or could it be that, like honest men before her, having  examined the realities, she backed away from the risk of sterile  confrontation with China? Of course Lady Thatcher claims to  support British policy now, but it is what is done in office  that counts.    Today we are told that the approach of the handover to China  and the Tiananmen Square massacre have politicised the  territory, whether we like it or not. To an extent that is  true. How have we set about channelling the democratic  aspirations that exist, reflected in the latest legislative  council vote for reform, faced with the remorseless fact of  mainland sovereignty in 1997?    By putting China publicly on the spot. In principle there is  nothing wrong with that. We did it in 1967 when we refused the  mainland's demands, shot some communist rioters and imprisoned  hundreds of others. The question then was simple: whether we  governed the territory, or they did. The position today is that  they are going to govern it, and have threatened to dismantle  whatever new democratic arrangements we put in place.    I have heard no rational explanation of the Governor's  decision to make the speech he did on arrival, promising more  democracy without reference to the Chinese. He would have got  little, maybe nothing. Logically, therefore, only two  explanations are possible: either we believed the paranoid  gerontocrats in Beijing would be swayed by the Governor's  sincerity and eloquence, and fall into line, or the speech, and  all subsequent actions, were undertaken in the knowledge they  would provoke a confrontation with China, without improving the  long-term democratic lot of the people of Hong Kong.    Whatever the outcome, our secret hope is that the history  books will say "at least the British had a go." In challenging  China to a duel we cannot win, we are more likely to stand  accused of naivety, vaingloriousness, or cynicism.    What do we think will induce a communist climbdown? Chinese  sensitivity to international opinion? If that is our hope then  the proponents of our policy take a more benign view of the  Chinese communists than I do. Or are we so sure a more liberal  regime will emerge that we can confidently take risks in the  meanwhile? And what if it doesn't?    There has been much talk of "British honour." It is well  there is no Dr Johnson around to expose the hypocrisy of that.  Securing your "honour" by risking the welfare of others seems  of questionable morality. Rather than seeking to bathe our  retreat in a heroic light, we should ask ourselves what the  effects of our actions are likely to be on others. So lost in  wonderment have we become at our own virtue and daring, that we  have rather overlooked that.    As a result of our actions it is probable that the Chinese  communists will be that much more repressive than they would  have been anyway. But then think of the resonant speeches we  shall be able to make in defence of this democratic politician,  that human rights activist, or that free-spoken editor when they  are pressured or locked away by the communists. Our policy may  not be moral but it is profoundly self-gratifying.    Among our other sudden discoveries are the Hong Kong Chinese  plutocrats whose enthusiasm for democracy is tempered by their  interest in keeping in with their future masters. A dismal  spectacle to be sure. But these are our much vaunted role  models of capitalist enterprise, on whose ambivalent  relationship with the mainland much of the colony's prosperity  has been built. If we didn't want to get our hands dirty, we  should never have grabbed Hong Kong in the first Place.    When it came up in Parliament some years ago, I questioned  not the desirability, but the feasibility of democracy. Until  today I have avoided criticising our stance publicly, and  declined to discuss it on the media. I am all too familiar with  the techniques of Chinese propaganda, which will now quote me as  saying that our policy is "immoral" while ignoring my argument.  I also find the tone of the domestic debate, with its facile  division between "China-hands" and sturdy opponents of  communism, tiresome and juvenile.    If I write in strong terms, it is because, like anyone who  knows it, I am sentimental about Hong Kong, where I once lived  with a Chinese family who taught me T'ang poetry in a tenement.  Despite everything, I remain optimistic about its future, and I  know enough about China to be wary of my own predictions. I  would just like to be convinced that our policy is directed to  the welfare of the people of Hong Kong, and not to our own moral  vanity.</p>

			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / International Company News: Mazda Motor to trim payout as it loses market share MAZDA Motor, the Japanese car maker, yesterday cut its profit estimate for the year by more than half and said it would cut its dividend payment. The move comes in response to the weak state of the domestic market, which has cut heavily into Mazda sales. Mazda, however, is facing an especially difficult situation compared to most Japanese car makers. It is losing market share in a declining market. At the same time it faces an enormous depreciation charge following a period of high investment to expand capacity made when it expected the market to continue growing rapidly. Mazda said its parent-company pre-tax profits in the year to March 1993 would come to only Y7bn (Dollars 57m), 64 per cent lower than last year's Y19.67bn in pre-tax profits, and 86 per cent below profits seen two years ago. It said it would cut its interim dividend from Y3.5 a share to Y3 a share, and reduce the second-half payout from Y4 to Y3 a share, resulting a 20 per cent cut in the full-year distribution. Like other Japanese car makers, Mazda has been forced to cut sales projections in response to the rapid cooling of consumer spending at home. Mazda had expected to increase unit sales this year, but now says sales will fall from 550,000 to 520,000 units at home. Exports are expected to be down by 60,000 units to 800,000 units. As a result, Mazda expects the value of sales to decline by less than 1 per cent to Y2,290bn. Net after tax income is projected to decline from Y9.27bn to Y3.5bn. Mazda is also expected to cut further into capital spending, bringing this down to Y125bn, compared to Y148bn last year. Mazda geared up strongly for growth in the late 1980s, and last year finished restructuring its domestic sales network into five channels, each of which must be supplied with a range of different vehicle models. The cost of investing in the sales network plus the high cost of developing so many new models is now weighing heavily on the company. Toyota is the only other domestic car company which maintains so many sales channels, but its sales are about 5 times larger than Mazda's. Mazda also appears to have been caught by the shift of consumer tastes in Japan toward more conservative goods. Its range of vehicles are probably the most radically styled on the road in Japan, which would probably have won it many customers at the time the expansion was planned. Now, however, it continues to lose market share to other companies whose models are arguably more dull.</p>

			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / Water companies told to cut costs Water companies must cut costs over the next five years, Mr Ian Byatt, director-general of Ofwat, the water industry regulator, said yesterday, Bronwen Maddox, Environment Correspondent, writes. Customers should not have to pay higher charges except to fund improvements that are 'absolutely necessary', he told the Financial Times conference in London on the European Water Industry. Mr Byatt will notify water companies this spring of the annual price increases which he proposes to let them charge from 1995 to 2005. However, he said the increases proposed by the companies in business plans submitted to him - which on average allow for an increase well above the rate of inflation - would be unacceptable to customers. 'I will expect companies to deliver existing services more cheaply in the future,' he said. 'I will look particularly hard at areas where prices are high - either by comparison with other companies or with the past.' Politicians of all parties and consumer groups have been increasingly concerned that water bills have outstripped inflation, particularly since the industry's privatisation in 1989. The water industry argues that the rise is needed to pay for long-overdue modernisation to the infrastructure of drains and treatment plants, and to bring water quality up to the standards specified in European Union directives. This year, the European Commission will start to review drinking water standards. The UK and some other EU countries have argued that some of the rules are unnecessary for health, and that they need to be better matched to scientific evidence about medical effects. Mr Ioannis Paleokrassas, the EU environment commissioner, has told the UK that it will not be given more time to comply with standards despite concern about the impact on bills.</p>

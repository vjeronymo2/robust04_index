			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Staff to vote on strikes at Bank More than 170 of the Bank of England's 185 computer staff are to be balloted on whether to hold a series of one-day strikes after the Bank proposed a new pay structure for computer staff and a 1 per cent pay increase. The ballot follows the decision by computer staff to reject management offers for restructuring pay scales, which Bifu, the banking union, says will mean that some people will not get a pay rise this year. The Bank, which also wants to introduce performance pay, said two-thirds of the workforce had accepted the offer.</p>

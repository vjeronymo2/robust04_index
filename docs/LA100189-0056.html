			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUST FOLLOWING THE LEADER  </P> <P> In the Sept. 24 View letters, Fred Nathan suggested the possibility of an Ollie  North presidency. Besides the fact that North is a lying, amoral,  soldier-of-fortune-mentality wacko, he is also a convicted felon, which means  that he cannot run for public office. The latter reason you should have  mentioned.  </P> <P> PAUL MILLS, Van Nuys  </P></p>

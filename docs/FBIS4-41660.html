			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 25 TASS ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI carries a  report about the concluding of Viktor Chernomyrdin's visit to  the U.S. Under the headline "Al Gore Enthusiastic, Chernomyrdin  Reserved." The Russian prime minister attended in the U.S. a  regular session of the intergovernmental Russian-American  commission on economic and technological cooperation. U.S. Vice  President Albert Gore described the results of that work as  remarkable success.    TRUD publishes in this connection an interview with  Chernomyrdin, who assures the public that the money spent on the  visit did not go to waste, including from the social point of  view. "What are actually the contracts on space exploration that  the delegation is bringing home?" the journalist asked  Chernomyrdin. The prime minister said in reply that "in fact,  they mean support for our industry, specifically, its branches  connected with arms manufacturing, those where conversion is now  going on, which are in a difficult situation today." He pointed  out that Russian-American relations were assessed only in a  positive way and rejected inventions of those 'prophets' by both  sides of the Atlantic, who predict the worsening of those  relations. "This is out of the question. Our relations are  improving and will continue to improve," Chernomyrdin said.    The newspaper carries contradictory comments of deputies to  the State Duma about the recent decree of President Yeltsin "On  urgent measures to protect the population from gangsterism and  other manifestations of organised crime." For example, A.  Ledzins from the December 12 group believes that if the decree  is put into effect, this will get Russia back by more than 50  years, to the period when the dividing line between law and  arbitrariness actually ceased to exist. However, N. Travkin,  leader of the Democratic Party of Russia, thinks that it is too  late already to try and resolve the crime problem with the help  of civilised methods. "Instead of arguing with the decree, it is  necessary to adopt as quick as possible the laws that will  permit to really start tackling it," he said.    KRASNAYA ZVEZDA and other newspapers highlight President  Yeltsin's statement at the Kerkira island, Greece, who said that  the agreement on partnership and cooperation between the Russian  Federation and the European Union, signed there, is a document  of great historic importance, which made it possible to take a  decisive step towards the restoration of unity in the european  continent. In the opinion of KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA, one of major  results of Yeltsin's trip is that the European Union and Russia  will start looking for ways to create a free trade zone.    KRASNAYA ZVEZDA publishes an interview with Aleksandr  Tushinskiy, first deputy defence minister of Belarus, who is  advocating the restoration of ties between the two countries,  including between Russian and Belarusian arms-manufacturing  enterprises.    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA highlights the results of presidential  elections in Belarus, where, according to the preliminary  results, the lead was captured by Aleksandr Lukashenko, head of  the parliamentary anti-mafia commission, who got 40-45 per cent  of votes. In this connection the newspaper describes as  "political amateurishness" appeals in the State Duma,  specifically those of Konstantin Zatulin, chairman of its  committee for ties with CIS member states, who urged at a  special press conference to support Belarusian Prime Minister  Vyacheslav Kebich at the elections in Belarus, and ex-prime  minister Leonid Kuchma -- at the elections in Ukraine. In the  opinion of the newspaper, Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk is  "the only politician who is capable of keeping Ukraine away from  sliding down from economic difficulties to political  confrontation of individual regions and social groups."    SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA writes that, by voting for Lukashenko,  "Belarusians actually voted against Yeltsin," because the  Russian president had a meeting with Kebich shortly before the  elections. The newspaper describes Kebich's visit to Moscow as a  "gross mistake". In its opinion, the trip eroded his prestige,  because Yeltsin in not popular in Belarus.    Ths same idea is expressed by PRAVDA in its article on this  subject, which is entitled "Lukashenko Packing Suitcases of his  Rivals." The newspaper highlights the words of Yuriy Belov,  chairman of the central executive committee of the Communist  Party of the Russian Federation, who believes that "socialism  has not disappeared, because the communist movement in Russia  has not disappeared either." In his opinion, opponents of  socialism "are especially afraid of its new image", which is in  line with historic traditions of the great Russian nation.    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA carries an article about prospects of  settling the Russian-Chechen crisis. It writes that the  relations between the two countries (on the level of  authorities) "have entered a new stage of development."  President Yeltsin's decision to start talks with the Chechen  authorities, the recent trip of Chechen President Dzhokhar  Dudaev to Sochi and the "pro-Yeltsin tone of official statements  coming now from Groznyy" are proof to that, the newspaper points  out. However, the initial stands of the two sides are  diametrially opposed to each other, and this is why the talks  are not going to be easy.</p>

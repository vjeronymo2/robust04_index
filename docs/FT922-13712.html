			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / Order to council over housing TOWER HAMLETS borough council was told by the High Court yesterday that it had no right to refuse emergency housing to foreigners it regarded, on the basis of its own inquiries, as illegal immigrants. Lord Justice Lloyd and Mr Justice Waterhouse held that only the home secretary could rule on the immigration status of foreign applicants seeking council housing as homeless persons with priority need. Unless the home secretary declared a home-seeker an illegal entrant who obtained leave to enter the UK by fraud, the applicant was entitled to be treated by housing authorities like anyone else.</p>

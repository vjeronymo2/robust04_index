			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Strong US indicator ignored GOOD figures for US industrial production failed to boost the dollar on foreign currency markets yesterday as investors continued to take the view that low interest rates make the US unit too expensive to hold. writes James Blitz. The markets disregarded encouraging news that industrial production had risen by 0.5 per cent, up from a revised 0.4 per cent gain in March, and pushed the dollar down from DM1.6125 to DM1.6090 in early European trading yesterday. The US unit eventually closed up on the day at DM1.6145. In late US trading, the dollar was at DM1.620. However, it lost ground to the yen, closing at Y130.20 from a previous close of Y130.30. Analysts believe that the latest economic indicators make it unlikely that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at its Federal Open Markets Committee on Tuesday. But one analyst said that the market was so dollar bearish at the moment that it was not prepared to consider realities. 'They will look for any excuse to go on selling them,' he said. Traders worldwide were transfixed yesterday by the problems facing the Canadian dollar after Olympia and York, the Canadian property developer, filed for protection from its creditors under Canadian and US insolvency laws. A number of central banks, including the Bank of England, were reported to have intervened in the market to support the Canadian currency after it had fallen to a 2-year low against the US unit. In Friday's late Asian trading, the US dollar rose to CDollars 1.2125 from an opening of Dollars 1.2018. This was followed by reports fo intervention by the Bank of Canada, Reserve Bank of Australia and Britain's central bank. By the end of European trading, the Canadian unit had recovered to CDollars 1.2040. Analysts still believe that the downside risk for the Canadian currency is far stronger, not least because of the Ottawa government's declared policy of keeping interest rates low. One London economist believes that the US dollar could easily test CDollars 1.22 in the coming week. In futures markets, there was higher Canadian/US dollar volatility with the currencies being quoted at 5.3/5.6 per cent for one-month options and 5.2/5.5 for three-month, up from about five per cent on Thursday. Sterling suffered no setback after it was revealed that the UK's annual rate of headline inflation had jumped to 4.3 per cent in April. Britain's Treasury insisted that the rise was due to 'special factors' rather than underlying inflationary pressures. The pound closed the day unchanged at DM2.9375, although it had risen as high as DM2.9411 shortly before the figures were released in the late morning.</p>

			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / Bundesbank rates policy criticised: Leading institutes see economic pick-up in last quarter of 1993 THE SIX leading economic institutes in Germany yesterday sharply criticised the Bundesbank for failing to cut its interest rates quickly and sharply enough to ease the recession in the German economy. In spite of a gloomy forecast of negative growth in the west German economy, of -2 per cent this year and -1.5 per cent for the whole country, the spring report of the institutes suggests that a pick-up in the economy will start in the last quarter of the year. That depends on the central bank continuing to reduce its interest rates steadily through the year. The German government also comes in for sharp criticism in its financial policy, for excessive increases in the tax burden planned for the coming years, and an inadequate effort to reduce public spending in the west to finance transfers to east Germany. The trade union battle for rapid wage equalisation between east Germany and the west, for which thousands of steel and engineering workers launched a strike this week, was described as 'drastically mistaken.' Overall, however, the economists, including in their ranks for the first time the institute for economic research in Halle, eastern Germany, cautioned against excessive pessimism over the state of the economy. They agreed that the German economy is now clearly in a recession, but that it is close to its lowest point. Causes of the sharp downturn were delays in reducing interest rates by the central bank, and uncertainty caused by the prolonged negotiations between the government, opposition, the 16 states, employers and trade unions, on a 'solidarity pact' for east Germany. An end to the fall in investment in equipment is in sight, thanks to declining interest rates and the probability of gradually recovering demand. There will nonetheless be a clear worsening in unemployment, with the average level reaching 3.55m during the year, compared with 2.98m in 1992. The prime objective of economic policy must now be a rapid end to recession in west Germany, which would otherwise endanger the tentative recovery in the eastern economy, they say. This inevitably means an increase in public sector budget deficits in the near term, although last year the deficit was reduced from 3.2 per cent of gross national product in 1991 to 2.8 per cent. Financial transfers to east Germany by public sector bodies, including social security, are expected to reach DM170bn (Pounds 68bn) in 1993, compared with DM156.2bn last year. West German industrial output declined again by 0.5 per cent in March, compared with the previous month, the economics ministry reported yesterday. The two-month total for February and March was down 10.7 per cent compared with the same period in 1992. Worst hit was the output of investment goods, down 15.9 per cent year-on-year, and manufacturing industry as a whole, down 12 per cent.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                        ECONOMIC FORECASTS FOR 1993                      % real change (1992 in brackets)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                  West          East        All Germany  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Gross domestic product     -2.0 (1.5)     5.5 (6.8)         -1.5 (2.0) Gross national product     -2.0 (0.9)     5.0 (7.4)         -1.5 (1.5) Exports*                   -1.5 (3.2)    8.0 (15.3)        -3.0 (-0.5) Imports*                   -1.0 (3.5)    2.0 (12.2)         -1.5 (2.1) Capital investment         -2.5 (1.5)   14.5 (24.0)          0.5 (4.6) Equipment                 -7.0 (-2.7)   10.0 (13.3)        -4.5 (-0.6) Construction                1.5 (5.6)   18.0 (34.2)          4.0 (9.1) Public consumption          0.0 (1.0)     0.0 (4.5)          0.0 (2.8) Private consumption        -1.0 (1.0)    -1.0 (5.4)         -1.0 (1.6) Consumer prices             4.0 (4.1)     8.5 (9.9)          4.5 (4.7) Unemployed (millions)       2.3 (1.8)   1.25 (1.17)        3.55 (2.98)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- * Figures for west and east include intra-German trade  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

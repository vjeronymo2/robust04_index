			<p><P> May 20, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. ATTEMPTS TO OUST GEN. NORIEGA  </P> <P> This is like being in Wonderland! The U.S. media ask us to believe that the  Panamanians all yearn to be ruled by an opposition group made up of their  nation's richest and most effete citizens, men whose love of liberty is  surpassed only by their passion for breeding racehorses (I refer to Eric  Delvalle), their zeal in accepting millions of CIA dollars, and their  entrepreneurial acumen (Carlos Eleta is still in jail in Georgia due to a small  matter of 600 kilos of coke.)  </P> <P> As for Noriega, his troubles began in 1987 when he moved against Panama's  banking secrecy laws and alarmed all the narcotics money launderers, causing  the U.S. State Department to immediately brand him a drug pusher. Curiouser and  curiouser!  </P> <P> Noriega is one of the few Third World leaders who does not take orders either  from the U.S. or from the Soviet Union, so both superpowers have no difficulty  agreeing that he must go.  </P> <P> Bush evidently wishes to emulate the contemptible imperialist Teddy Roosevelt.  </P> <P> It took exceptional chutzpah to accuse Noriega of "bullying." Do you think the  citizens of Panama are impressed by this charade? We shall see.  </P> <P> DANIEL PLATT  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

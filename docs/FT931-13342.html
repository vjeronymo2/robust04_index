			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Books: In the beginning . . . SHADOWS OF FORGOTTEN ANCESTORS by Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan Random Century Pounds 17.99, 505 pages NEITHER the New Ageist title nor the mawkish cover illustration does this book justice. Within, it is a feast. Absorbing and elegantly written, it tells of the origins of life on earth, describes its variety and character, and culminates in a discussion of human nature and the complex traces of humankind's evolutionary past - hence the 'shadows' of the title. This is fascinating science gracefully purveyed. The exposition is leisurely, literate and wry, sometimes self-indulgent but always pleasingly so. It is an amazing story masterfully told - easily the best popular introduction to ethology and evolutionary biology now available. The story begins at the beginning: with the turbulent mass of dust and gas which spawned the sun and its planets, and prompted the frightening early history of earth. Thereafter the tale unfolds more circumstantially. Its proper commencement lies with the stromatolites, single-celled organisms living in colonies, whose fossils date back three and a half billion years. From these most ancient of creatures life's perilous history stems. To recount that history Sagan and Druyan have to explain genetics and evolutionary theory. They do it with exemplary lucidity. Thus armed, they give dazzling accounts of insects, snakes, apes, humans, and much besides, aiming to give us a sense of humanity's place in the evolutionary scheme by exhibiting the enormous variety and curiosity of life and the connections which unify its story. 'We achieve some measure of adulthood', the authors write, 'when we recognise our parents as they really were, without sentimentalising or mythologising, but also without blaming them unfairly for our imperfections.' When with similar dispassion we understand something of our evolutionary inheritance - our biological parentage - we come of age as a species. Every page yields nuggets. The kind of lesson to be learned from biological understanding is well illustrated by the following juxtaposition of facts. Humans find it convenient to geld male domestic animals. 'One or two skilled motions of the blade - or a deft bite by a reindeer-herding Lapp woman - and the testosterone levels are down to manageable proportions', the authors remark. Only a few males are left intact for breeding purposes. In the wild, when one male is defeated by another in a mating contest - and this applies to creatures as different as snakes and apes - the conquered male's testosterone levels decline steeply and he slinks away. One major effect, as with domestic animals, is that trouble is kept within bounds. Parallels must be treated cautiously. Humans and chimpanzees share 99.6 per cent of their active genes, inherited from a common ancestor. By any standards this is close kinship. But the differences - outstandingly, language and what language makes possible - are more obvious than the similarities. Still, as the authors show in four fascinating chapters on monkeys and apes, both the parallels and differences are highly instructive. One female chimp, taught to sort pictures of humans and non-humans into different categories, placed pictures of chimps in the 'human' file. The authors venture some controversial sallies. Sagan is famous for arguing that there must be life elsewhere in the universe. Here he and Druyan make an analogous suggestion: that consciousness might be a more pervasive feature of terrestrial life than most thinkers allow. Even insects, they muse, could have a measure of awareness beyond the merely reflexive. The naturalist Jakob von Uexkull wrote, 'When the dog runs, the dog moves its legs. When the sea urchin runs, the legs move the sea urchin.' But Sagan and Druyan are not so sure. After describing the astounding engineering skills of the spider, they remark, 'she spins her web now. She reaps the reward later, perhaps much later. Does she know what she's waiting for? Does she dream of succulent moths and foolish mayflies? Or does she wait with her mind a blank?' Such innocuous-seeming questions prompt others that are among philosophy's deepest. Analogy presents the authors with their most dangerous temptation. Parallels between animal and human characteristics can enlighten remarkably, but also mislead. Yet although they sometimes tread close to the edge, Sagan and Druyan are alert to the risks, and indeed end the book by warning against them. One is left with a strong sense that what underlies their remarkably skilful and accessible account is high scientific competence. It is this which makes their book so good.</p>

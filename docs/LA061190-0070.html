			<p><P> June 11, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOU BORED WITH THE SUPERVISORS?;  </P> <P> THE JUDGE IS RIGHT AND MOST ANGELENOS KNOW IT  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon has given the Los Angeles County Board of  Supervisors until June 27 to revise the district lines they drew in 1981, when  they illegally conspired to disenfranchise the county's 2 million Latinos.  </P> <P> Good sense and a decent respect for their sworn obligation to the Constitution  would dictate that the supervisors comply. Unfortunately, in this affair the  board's majority -- Supervisors Kenneth Hahn and Edmund D. Edelman dissenting  -- has so far given scant evidence of either quality. It is never too late,  however, to do the right thing -- especially since the consequences of not  doing so are clear.  </P> <P> June 27 "is, quite respectfully, a deadline," Kenyon told the board's attorney  Thursday, when he made his ruling. For all his tact, Kenyon is understandably  out of patience with the obstinate majority on the five-member board. That  obstinacy is nowhere more apparent than in the majority's insistence on  pursuing an appeal that is both costly and legally without merit. As Kenyon  admonished the board, failure to present a legally acceptable plan will force  him to draw the new lines himself.  </P> <P> That would be unfortunate, for, as the city of Los Angeles' recent experience  has demonstrated, the public's battered confidence in local government is  enhanced when it sees elected officials putting their own house in order. On a  more utilitarian level, it also is clear that the redistricting plan the  supervisors devised in 1981 was not simply one that perpetuated a system that  has denied Latinos, African-Americans and Asian-Americans representation on the  board for 115 years, but one that virtually guarantees an inefficient,  unaccountable county government.  </P> <P> A five-member board cannot adequately govern a county whose population of 8.5  million is larger than those of 42 states. In this case, then, the path to  equal opportunity for the minority is also the path to responsible, responsive  government for all. That means a plan that expands the board to seven or more  seats, and whether that scheme is drawn by the board or by Judge Kenyon, that  is what the people of Los Angeles County have a right to expect.  </P> <P> Still unresolved is the question of whether Kenyon will overturn the results of  last Tuesday's election in the 1st District, where the top vote-getter was, in  fact, a Latina, Sarah Flores. It is difficult not to sympathize with her  predicament and that of her run-off opponent, Judge Gregory O'Brien, who is  himself in favor of expanding the board. But Kenyon may have to invalidate the  election, as judges have in many cases involving violations of the Voting  Rights Act in the South.  </P> <P> If that happens, it will be well to recall that this bitter disgrace was laid  upon the people of Los Angeles not by a judge, but by a board majority that  gives the appearance of being lost to almost any consideration but  self-interest.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Measure of Power  </P> <P> The L.A. County Board of Supervisors serves 8.5 million people, a population  greater than those of 42 states. Some examples:  </P> <P> L.A County Board of Supervisors: 8.5 million  </P> <P> Alabama: 4.1 million  </P> <P> Indiana: 5.4 million  </P> <P> Massachusetts: 5.8 million  </P> <P> New Jersey: 7.7 million  </P> <P> Source: Population Reference Bureau Inc.  </P> <P> 1987 Estimate  </P></p>

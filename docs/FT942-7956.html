			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / UK Company News: BAA interest in Australian airports BAA, the airports operator, said yesterday that it was 'interested' in bidding for several of Australia's airports, particularly the three biggest  -Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane. Earlier this month, the Australian government signalled its intention to privatise the Federal Airports Corporation, which runs the airports. But a decision on the structure of the sale and whether foreign ownership will be allowed is not expected until later this year.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 22 Apr -- Russia is working on a package of  proposals that are to form the basis of its cooperation with  NATO, Andrey Kozyrev told journalists today after his meeting  with Danish Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Petersen.    Replying to a question about the prospects for Russia's  acceding to the "Partnership for Peace" program, the Russian  foreign minister said: "We are working on a more substantial  package of proposals than just what NATO is suggesting to us."    A. Kozyrev stressed that Moscow favors "more substantial,  more substantive relations with NATO which would really make the  partnership a partnership."</p>

			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / People: Former Bass men draughted in to Crown Buckley Crown Buckley, the Welsh brewer based at Pontyclun, Mid Glamorgan, has appointed three non-executive directors after the completion last week of its management buy-out from Harp Lager, the Guinness subsidiary. David Inns, 58, who retired two years ago as financial director of Bass, will become chairman of the company, which has 80 pubs and clubs in south Wales. The other new directors are Jeff Harris, 43, who was managing director until three years ago of Bass North and is chief executive of Castle Leisure, a Cardiff-based company which runs bingo clubs, and Andrew Smith. Smith, 32, is associate director of Prudential Ventures Management, which was the lead equity investor in the buyout. Harp Lager had held 75 per cent of the equity since 1990 after Crown Buckley had had an unfortunate ownership by Barlow Clowes, the company run by the financier Peter Clowes who was convicted of fraud last year. The rest of the equity was held mainly by clubs and club members in south Wales, who voted overwhelmingly in favour of the buy-out which was led by Mike Salter, managing director of Crown Buckley. The buy-out, which was celebrated with a barrel of beer brewed for the occasion, is seen as safeguarding the future of the company's brewery at Llanelli, Dyfed. Its best-selling beer is Buckley's Best and last year, the 250th anniversary of the brewery, a draught beer called the Reverend James was introduced in honour of its founder.</p>

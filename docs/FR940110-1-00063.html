			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposed provision is consistent with the requirement of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance with fair housing laws contained in &sect;960.5(a)(2)(i) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Board's existing AHP regulation, and the requirement under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existing practice that applications indicate how the sponsor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposes to affirmatively further such compliance. See 12 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 960.5(a)(2)(i).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The twenty percent requirement and alternatives. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 960.9(c) of the proposed rule incorporates the existing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maximum subsidy limitation requirement and alternatives contained  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in &sect;960.9 of the Board's interim rule, with minor changes in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> language and one substantive modification discussed below. See  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12 CFR 960.9 (58 FR 17968 (April 7, 1993)). The 20 percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement and the alternatives discussed below implement the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maximum subsidy limitation requirement contained in section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10(j)(9)(F) of the Act. See 12 U.S.C. 1430(j)(9)(F). Since the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 20 percent requirement or an alternative must be satisfied by all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AHP applications to avoid over-subsidization of a project, it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> set forth as a threshold requirement in the proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The twenty percent requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 960.9(c)(1)(i) of the proposed rule provides generally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that a Bank shall not offer subsidized advances or direct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subsidies to applicants in excess of that amount needed to reduce  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the monthly housing costs for income-eligible households, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> committed to in the AHP application, to 20 percent of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> household's gross monthly income (the 20 percent requirement). In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> projects where other forms of federal, state, local or private  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subsidized assistance are being used in conjunction with AHP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subsidized advances or direct subsidies, the total amount of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subsidized assistance, including funds provided under the AHP,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shall not be in excess of the amount needed to reduce the monthly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> housing costs for the income-eligible households, as committed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the AHP application, to 20 percent of the household's gross  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monthly income.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Monthly housing costs are defined in proposed &sect;960.9(c)(1)(ii)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) For households in AHP-assisted owner-occupied housing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> units, mortgage principal and interest payments, real property  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taxes, homeowners' insurance, a reasonable estimate of utility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> costs excluding telephone service, and for households in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AHP-assisted condominium, cooperative, mutual housing or other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> housing projects involving common ownership, those portions of any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regular operating assessment or fee allocated for principal and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interest payments, taxes, insurance and a reasonable estimate of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> utilities attributable to the household's share of the common area  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and/or the individual unit; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

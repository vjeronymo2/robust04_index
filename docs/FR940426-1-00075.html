			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 184(c) specifies a procedure for the OTC to develop  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommendations for additional control measures to be applied  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within all or a part of the OTR if the OTC determines that such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measures are necessary to bring any area in the OTR into  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attainment for ozone by the applicable dates in the Act. Section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 184(c)(1) provides that Upon petition of any States within a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transport region for ozone, and based on a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> majority vote of the Governors on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commission (or their designees), the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commission may, after notice and opportunity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for public comment, develop recommendations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for additional control measures to be applied  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within all or a part of such transport region  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if the commission determines such measures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are necessary to bring any area in such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> region into attainment by the dates provided  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by [subpart II of part D of title I of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Clean Air Act].  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 184(c) also lays out procedures the Administrator is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to follow in responding to recommendations from the OTC. Upon  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receipt of the recommendations, the Administrator is to publish a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice stating that the recommendations are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available and providing an opportunity for a public hearing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within 90 days. On March 18, 1994, EPA published a notice  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> announcing receipt of the OTC recommendation, 59 FR 12914. EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> further announced on April 8, 1994 that a public hearing would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> held in Hartford, Connecticut on May 2&hyph;3, 1994, 59 FR 16811  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (April 8, 1994). The Administrator is also to ``commence a review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the recommendations to determine whether the control measures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the recommendations are necessary to bring any area in such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> region into attainment by the dates provided by [subpart II] and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are otherwise consistent with [the] Act.'' Finally, in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> undertaking her review, the Administrator is to consult with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> members of the OTC and is to take into account the data, views,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and comments received pursuant to the public hearing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Last, sections 184(c) (4) and (5) govern EPA's response to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the OTC recommendations. The Administrator is to determine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether to approve, disapprove, or partially approve and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> partially disapprove the recommendations within nine months of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receipt. For any disapproval, the Administrator is to specify:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Why any disapproved additional control measures are not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary to bring any area in such region into attainment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by the dates provided by [subpart II] or are otherwise not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consistent with the Act; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Recommendations concerning equal or more effective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actions that could be taken by the commission to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conform the disapproved portion of the recommendations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the requirements of [section 184].  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 184(c)(5) provides that, upon approval or partial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approval of any recommendations, the Administrator is to issue to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> each State in the OTR to which an approved requirement applies a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> finding under section 110(k)(5) that the SIP for that State is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inadequate to meet the requirements of section 110(a)(2)(D),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quoted above. Under section 184(c)(5), the Administrator's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> finding of inadequacy under section 110(a)(2)(D) is to require  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that each affected State revise its SIP to include the approved  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional control measures within one year after the finding is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issued.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, section 184(d) provides that, for purposes of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 184, the Administrator is to ``promulgate criteria for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purposes of determining the contribution of sources in one area  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to concentrations of ozone'' in another nonattainment area. These  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criteria are to ``require that the best available air quality  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitoring and modeling techniques be used for purposes of making  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such determinations.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Background Regarding OTC LEV Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Administrator convened the OTC on May 7, 1991.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thereafter, the OTC moved to work toward a regional ozone  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> strategy with emphasis on consensus agreements to adopt regional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measures to address the ozone problem in the Northeast. To  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> address the contribution of motor vehicles to the Northeast ozone  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> problem, the OTC focussed early on emissions standards for new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> motor vehicles and on adoption of federal reformulated gasoline  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> throughout the OTR as potential additional control measures. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act, however, imposes certain limitations on the States' ability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to adopt new motor vehicle emissions standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

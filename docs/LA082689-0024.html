			<p><P> August 26, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> TWO VIEWS OF JUDGE MARGARET GRIGNON  </P> <P> The publicity and praise that Judge Margaret Grignon is receiving to me is most  unjustified.  </P> <P> I have had the personal experience of sitting in Judge Grignon's court for many  days. Her "tough" approach to criminals is not so much for justice, but just  plain lack of knowledge of criminal law. This was very obvious when the  attorneys present and her own colleagues said "Your honor, you can't do that --  the law says, etc." Why Gov. George Deukmejian and Justice Armand Arabian of  the state Court of Appeal are pushing her forward is beyond comprehension.  </P> <P> She lacks the knowledge and experience for criminal court. That's why she sends  everyone to jail because she doesn't know what else to do. Judge Grignon also  experiences a convenient memory loss and has blatantly allowed a deputy D.A. to  lie about certain facts in a case, then refused to hear testimony regarding the  truth of the particular matter in the case. This omission of the truth and  disallowing of testimony was very detrimental to the defendant.  </P> <P> I say "thumbs down" on Judge Margaret Grignon and God help us all if she gets  appointed to the state Court of Appeal.  </P> <P> P. J. CLARK  </P> <P> West Hills  </P></p>

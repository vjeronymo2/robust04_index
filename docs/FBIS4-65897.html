			<p>BFN     [Text] During this period of unease in the Balkans, cordial  Greek-Bulgarian relations constitute a sound basis on which all  the efforts for inter-Balkan cooperation can be built. This  statement was made by Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias after  meeting with his Bulgarian counterpart Stanislav Daskalov, who  began an official visit to our country yesterday. Mr. Papoulias  said Mr. Daskalov's visit is a big step forward in  Greek-Bulgarian relations and noted that Bulgarian Prime  Minister Lyuben Berov will soon visit Athens, while he himself  has accepted an invitation by his Buglarian counterpart to visit  Sofia.    One of the important problems in Greek-Bulgarian relations  is  the Nestos River water, and the binational committee will meet  in the first half of June to discuss the issue, Mr. Papoulias  said, adding the hope that progress will be made. At the  meeting, which was held today at 1030 in the Foreign Ministry,  the two sides also discussed bilateral cooperation on the basic  highway routes of Alexandroupolis-Svilengrad and  Thessaloniki-Sofia as well as the north-south Egnatia Highway.  These are significant large projects for improving the  infrastructure as well as a contribution to future inter-Balkan  cooperation.    Finally, Mr. Papoulias said concern was expressed over the  war in Bosnia, where the two countries' appraisals coincide that  hostilities must stop and negotiations begin immediately. Both  sides feel that Greek-Bulgarian friendship constitutes a firm  basis for all developments in the Balkans.    Responding to a question about the Greek position on the  Albanian issue and whether he raised the Skopje [The Former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] issue at the meeting with  his Bulgarian counterpart, Mr. Papoulias said he told Mr.  Daskalov that the question of respect for the Greek minority's  rights is the cornerstone of any development in the  Greek-Albanian relations. The Skopje issue was also discussed;  both Greece and Bulgaria hope this crisis will be overcome. Mr.  Papoulias will visit New York in mid-June, where he will meet  with Cyrus Vance. The meeting between Ambassador Khristos  Zakharakis and Vance might prepare the ground for good results  in his own visit, Mr. Papoulias said.    The Bulgarian foreign minister said that at the meeting they  agreed on the mutual desire to develop friendly Greek-Bulgarian  relations to the benefit of both countries as well as peace and  stability in the Balkans. Mr. Daskalov concluded: We  appreciate Greece's support for Bulgarian ties with European  organizations, particularly with the European Union. We agreed  to form various groups of experts who will work to solve  specific problems in all sectors of bilateral cooperation.</p>

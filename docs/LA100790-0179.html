			<p><P> October 7, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NOTEBOOK: PAYING A PRICE FOR GIFT OF LIFE  </P> <P> Most of us probably remember the awkward times in our childhood when we began  exploring confusing and sometimes embarrassing topics.  </P> <P> For my friends and me in rural Kennett Square, Pa., reproduction was a mystery.  </P> <P> I remember when my friend, Tommy Dewey, and I first discussed our origins while  riding the bus home from grade school one day. The question was simple enough:  Where did you come from?  </P> <P> Other kids joined in. I recall giving the credit to my parents. But Tommy threw  us all for a loop. A "Star Trek" fanatic, Tommy told us that "Scotty" had made  him.  </P> <P> It is with that same innocence that those with the National Coalition Against  Surrogacy would like us to consider cases like Anna L. Johnson and the  estimated 4,000 children who have born into surrogate relationships, according  to statistics compiled by the Center for Surrogate Parenting in Beverly Hills.  </P> <P> What happens when children born to surrogate mothers grow up?  </P> <P> Those involved with the coalition are promising reporters that we will soon be  writing and telling tragic stories of human greed.  </P> <P> "What is a kid going to think when he or she finds that the birth mother  remodeled her kitchen with money from a (surrogate) contract?" asks Sharon  Huddle-DeAngelo.  </P> <P> Strip away the rhetoric from both sides of this issue and you still find the  lives of children born into surrogate relationships.  </P> <P> It also still leaves the delicate task of explaining these contracts -- and the  money -- to children who are growing older and no doubt riding the school  buses.  </P> <P> Ralph Fagen, co-director of the Center for Surrogate Parenting, said the first  child produced by a surrogate relationship was born in 1975, making him or her  about 14 years old now.  </P> <P> He says the center encourages parents of surrogate children to explain to their  kids that they were "born out of special relationships," that they were  specially wanted by their parents, who happened to be infertile.  </P> <P> He said the center encourages parents to be open with their children, urging  them to provide any information to them, even details about their surrogate  mothers.  </P> <P> A 1989 study of children and families involved in surrogacy suggests that  levels of stress are within normal limits.  </P> <P> The study included 11 children born to surrogate mothers and 41 children who  are members of the surrogates' families.  </P> <P> Still, people such as Huddle-DeAngelo and Mary Beth Whitehead-Gould, surrogate  mother in the famous Baby M case who is now involved with the coalition, say  surrogate arrangements -- especially those in which women are paid for carrying  other people's babies -- must end.  </P> <P> They say such contracts and transactions are equivalent to "breeding."  </P> <P> "We don't want to face that, so we call it surrogacy," Huddle-DeAngelo said. "I  don't think children will like it at all when they find out they were exchanged  for money."  </P> <P> "We have to look at human bonding," Whitehead-Gould said recently of the  Johnson case. "What about the child, years later, who learns he or she was sold  for $10,000?"  </P> <P> Somehow, it seems that any kid might have an easier time understanding Tommy's  cosmic explanation than one involving a surrogate mother and $10,000.  </P></p>

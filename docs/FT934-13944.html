			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets: Global equity markets step up a gear With few exceptions the world's equity markets stepped up a gear last week, leading to a fresh spate of record highs. The FT-Actuaries World Index rose 1.2 per cent, with the best gains coming from the Far East and Latin America. Nomura's global strategy team, writing at the end of last week, commented that further sharp rises were likely in the South-east Asian markets, 'driven by an absence of sellers as much as by the (huge) weight of money still trying to get into the market'. US money has been largely responsible for the bull run in this part of the world (while also contributing to rises elsewhere, particularly in Europe); and yesterday Hong Kong put on a further 3.1 per cent on top of Friday's close. Morgan Stanley has recently become an aggressive promoter of this market, seeing it also as a gateway to China. Mr David Roche, global strategist, commented last week that 'Hong Kong's expanding prospective price/earnings multiple, which on 1993 earnings is now around 16 times, can be seen as a consequence of the lower political risk'. He added: 'Eventually we expect the Hong Kong market to trade at multiples representative of the Asian region as a whole, typically 20 to 25 times prospective 1993 earnings, especially in light of its superior earnings growth prospects for this year and next.' In Europe, Italy and France were exceptions to the upward trend. The Milan equity market was pushed lower ahead of the close of the account last Friday and, more importantly, selling ahead of the Fiat rights issue, which came to the market also on Friday. Paris spent the week partly in expectation of further interest rate reductions, which failed to materialise. The UBS global research team has noted that 'with downgrading of 1994 GDP forecasts, hopes for recovery are fading and French equities are increasingly dependent on an early cut in rates'.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                              MARKETS IN PERSPECTIVE  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                  % change   % change in                 % change in local currency**    sterling**  USDollars**               1 Week  4 Weeks   1 Year  Start of Start of    Start of                                           1993     1993        1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria       +2.16    +5.42    +30.07   +29.22   +29.18      +29.05 Belgium       +1.58    +4.57    +27.81   +22.31   +14.66      +14.55 Denmark       +1.00    +2.76    +40.00   +33.11   +27.30      +27.18 Finland       +1.02   +12.00   +153.27   +89.83   +73.92      +73.77 France        -0.73    +2.01    +31.70   +18.89   +14.99      +14.88 Germany       +0.71    +6.92    +37.12   +29.97   +30.51      +30.37 Ireland       +0.44    +2.01    +57.82   +41.82   +27.10      +26.97 Italy         -3.08    -3.35    +54.07   +38.70   +28.96      +28.83 Netherlands   +2.00    +6.66    +33.07   +28.12   +28.46      +28.33 Norway        +1.48    +5.86    +59.53   +35.69   +32.39      +32.26 Spain         +2.62    +5.87    +61.14   +41.05   +23.89      +23.76 Sweden        +2.60    +9.53    +91.92   +38.46   +24.51      +24.38 Switzerland   +2.57    +8.60    +39.42   +26.32   +28.89      +29.76 UK            +0.26    +3.42    +25.85   +11.21   +11.21      +11.09  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- EUROPE        +0.57    +4.42    +34.65   +21.23   +19.30      +19.19 Australia     +2.10    +7.59    +38.81   +28.47   +23.87      +23.75 Hong Kong     +8.61   +17.47    +40.48   +55.27   +55.75      +55.59 Japan         -0.08    +0.54    +24.21   +25.58   +46.61      +46.46 Malaysia      +2.96   +13.69    +84.27   +69.38   +74.35      +74.18 New Zealand   +2.89    +7.03    +59.82   +39.77   +49.79      +49.64 Singapore     +7.96   +12.81    +75.78   +49.01   +56.00      +55.85  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Canada        +3.60    +5.73    +21.89   +16.92   +11.81      +11.69 USA           +1.87    +2.12    +14.51    +7.56    +7.67       +7.56 Mexico        +5.70    +4.92    +34.11    +7.17    +7.55       +7.44 South Africa  +1.57    +2.81    +39.54   +25.15   +47.09      +46.93  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- WORLD INDEX   +1.16    +2.73    +23.77   +17.39   +22.38      +22.38  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ** Based on October 15th 1993.

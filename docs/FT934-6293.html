			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / International Capital Markets: IFR underwriting survey Most borrowers consider distribution capacity the top priority in selecting an underwriter for Eurobond issues, according to a survey by IFR. Next in importance are new issue pricing, secondary market support and impartiality. However, the survey belies protests by underwriters that league tables are not important: 51 per cent of respondents ranked position in league tables either second or third on a scale of one to six. In the Eurodollar bond market, Goldman Sachs is the top underwriter, with perceived strength in generating new ideas and giving impartial advice. In the sterling Eurobond market, UBS and CS First Boston topped the table. Only two UK houses, Barclays de Zoete Wedd and SG Warburg, made it to the top five. Borrowers said they received a better service in sectors which were open to competition from foreign banks. Borrowers Survey '93; published by IFR Research, 11 New Fetter Lane, London EC4A 1JN.</p>

			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / Management: Business in the classroom - Employer-education partnerships are increasing Education-business partnerships, which employers use to improve employee career development and boost their community links, appear to be gaining in popularity. They are also penetrating every corner of the UK, as the winners of this year's Gardner Merchant awards for excellence in education-business partnerships demonstrate. The overall winners - awarded this week - came from Skye and from Northampton, while the winner in a third category came from the Handsworth district of Birmingham. Industry's understanding of involvement with education is also progressing. First seen as an aid to public relations, with a possible boost to long-term recruitment, it now forms a positive part of employee-development programmes. Rather than helping local schools via a cheque from the budget for charitable donations, personnel departments now see the benefits of sending employees on secondments to schools. Gardner Merchant's judging policy reflects this. Garry Hawkes, chief executive, said: 'What we were looking for was mutuality, so that both sides benefited, and for something that was meaningful for both the companies and the children, not just an exercise in self-gratification.' Long-term benefits in terms of improving the skills base of UK industry could be immense. At the Hopping Hill primary school and Express Lift Company partnership in Northampton, winner in the category for individual schools and businesses, an informal link developed into a systematised personnel policy. It started in 1988 after a girl told the headteacher, Val Newton, 'girls can't be engineers'. Newton asked Express Lifts, a local engineering employer, to prove otherwise, and a female technical apprentice was despatched to the school to talk about her job. The scheme has since developed into an annual 'project', involving boys and girls. This year, eight teams of eight-year-olds were charged with building a wind-powered vehicle, each supervised by an apprentice. To succeed in the project, each entry was judged against standards of design, quality and cost-effectiveness. Janet Stephenson, a director of Express Lifts, admits: 'At first we thought it was just a PR exercise, but we began to see the benefits for our apprentices of going into the school and working as project managers.' Most of the employees seconded are non-graduates, in the second-year of a technical apprenticeship. According to Stephenson: 'Working at the school is built into their management training, because they gain managerial skills from working with the children in a non-threatening environment which they would not be able to gain elsewhere.' Apprentices improve their communication skills, while the project also addresses the engineering industry's 'image problem'. Partnerships can also aim at improving employment opportunities. The Skye and Lochalsh Partnership, for example, won the award for links involving several businesses and schools. Launched in 1992, it now involves 173 employers and a number of primary and high schools. Projects to date include teacher placements at Talisker Distillery and a fund management company. Businesses have arranged problem-solving challenges for school children, and mock interviews. The high entry figure of 150 for Gardner Merchant's awards - double last year's total - shows that education-business partnerships are growing more popular, as companies appreciate the full potential benefits. Altruism and broader political objectives are not wholly lacking. Stephenson says: 'It's one way of industry having some input into what's going on in schools. We moan about education so we should do something to improve it.'</p>

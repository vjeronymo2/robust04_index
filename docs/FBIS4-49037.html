Brown and O'Leary held separate discussions with Zou Jiahua  on prospects of economic, trade, and scientific and  technological cooperation between the two countries. Brown  said: The United States and China have achieved encouraging  progress in many important areas, and the United States will  continue to work for developing long-term economic and trade  relations with China.

Zou Jiahua said: A good foundation has been established for  developing cooperation between the two countries in the fields  of economy, trade, and science and technology. As China is  quickening the pace of establishing a socialist market economy,  the potential of the Chinese market has become increasingly  greater. This will provide broad prospects in economic, trade,  and scientific and technological cooperation between the two  countries. He pointed out: If things go well in Sino-U.S.  relations and man-made trammels [ji ban 5015 4810] are removed,  greater progress will be made in U.S.-China economic and trade  cooperation.    The two sides also discussed specific issues concerning  strengthening their cooperation, and unanimously felt that  candid, pragmatic, and friendly exchanges of opinions are very  beneficial.    Zeng Peiyan, vice minister of the State Planning Commission;  Liu Huaqiu, vice foreign minister; and Li Daoyu, Chinese  Ambassador to the United States, who are accompanying Zou Jiahua  on his visit, were present at the talks.

			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / Producer prices show modest rise The annual rate of increase in UK producer prices fell to 3.7 per cent in January, giving further encouragement to those who believe that inflationary pressures are subdued. Food and crude oil prices have been particularly weak over the past year, according to figures published by the Central Statistical Office. The output price index, which measures the prices of manufactured products at the factory gate, rose by 0.3 per cent between December and January. The annual rate fell back from 4 per cent in December (which included an exceptionally big jump in January 1993). If food, beverages, tobacco and petroleum are excluded, the annual increase in the 12 months to January was just 2.6 per cent. This compared with 4 per cent in the year to December. Input prices, which reflect manufacturers' costs, fell by 0.3 per cent between December and January, or 0.2 per cent on a seasonally adjusted basis. In the 12 months to January, input prices have fallen by 2.5 per cent. The statistics may give some support to the Bank of England's decision to cut base rates last week, which the chancellor justified by saying that 'looking ahead, inflationary pressures appear subdued'. Analysts at brokers Greenwell Montagu pointed out that a downward trend in underlying prices - excluding food, beverages, tobacco and petroleum - was now firmly in place, so there should be 'good news for RPI'. January's retail prices index is published on Wednesday. Mr Peter Oppenheimer of James Capel said: 'Overall, the latest producer price data are very supportive of our view that core retail price inflation will drop below 2 per cent this year and will remain there through 1995.'</p>

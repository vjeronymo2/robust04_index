			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Microfilm Reprographics static at Pounds 8.23m MICROFILM Reprographics, the microfilming bureau which has large operations in both the UK and US, yesterday posted flat full year pre-tax profits, but nevertheless increased its dividend by 20 per cent. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 8.23m in the year to June 30 compared with profits of Pounds 8.19m last time and came from turnover which slipped slightly to Pounds 33.7m (Pounds 34.4m). The results reflect the impact of the recession on both sides of the Atlantic and the effects of the particularly weak dollar on US earnings, partly offset by higher net interest income. Although the latest results are a sharp contrast to those in the late 1980s, which saw double digit profit and turnover growth in successive years, the group's board said recent acquisitions 'should add significantly' to the progress from its traditional business and expects 1993 'will be a particularly successful year.' Earnings per share in the latest full year grew to 10.6p (10.4p) out of which the group is paying a final dividend of 2.88p per share (2.4p) making a total of 4.32p per share, up from 3.6p a year earlier. During the year the group acquired Memex Information Systems, an information retrieval software company, Sol Microfilm, Micro Reid and DPTS, which is involved in data storage and retrieval primarily for the oil industry. Since the end of its financial year the group has made two further acquisitions as part of its strategy to broaden the range and geographic area of services it can offer. Atlanta-based Fort Knox Secured Data Storage was acquired at the end of July for an initial consideration of Dollars 860,000. A Dollars 300,000 consulting agreement will also be paid to a former stockholder over a four-year period. Fort Knox provides high security storage and retrieval of paper and magnetic media and will be merged with the group's existing Atlanta office. In addition Microfilm acquired NCR's computer output microfilm (COM) bureau business last month for an initial cash payment of Pounds 1m. A deferred payment of Pounds 1 will be paid for every Pounds 1 of COM turnover over Pounds 1m in the next 12 months. NCR's COM bureau operates from four sites in the UK and had turnover in the year to November 30 last year of Pounds 1.43m. Its operations are being merged with Microfilm Reprographics' existing computer output microfilm business. Despite the expenditure on the acquisitions the group ended the year with cash reserves of Pounds 8.3m, up Pounds 1.8m from a year earlier.</p>

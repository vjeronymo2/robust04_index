			<p><P> August 3, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONE MAN'S STRATEGY FOR HIS BROTHER'S FREEDOM;  </P> <P> DON'T PROVOKE, DON'T FORGET, KEEP TALKING  </P> <P> Dealing with hostage-takers is a dangerous and frustrating business. Police  talking to a bank robber with his gun at someone's head, or control-tower  negotiators parleying with an airline hijacker, know the rules: Keep calm. Stay  firm, but keep the dialogue flowing. Wait on your opponent. Never provoke him.  </P> <P> The time span of a Beirut kidnaping is infinitely longer than an airport  stakeout, and it's harder to deal with kidnapers who aren't cornered. But the  same rules apply. And politicians ignore them at their peril. There's no quick  way of hitting back at the Lebanese Hezbollah.  </P> <P> The greatest mistake is to react impetuously. Politicians love a quick fix. But  the Israeli government's Old Testament solution to its problems -- "a kidnap  for a kidnap" -- was like President Jimmy Carter's attempt to rescue the  hostages in Tehran, doomed to failure from the outset. This enemy plays by  different rules. Hostages are bound to be the first casualties.  </P> <P> A more insidious error is to remove the issue from the political agenda. When  politicians can't solve a problem quickly, they usually ignore it. This is a  dangerous betrayal of democracy.  </P> <P> Political hostage-takers are not individual gangsters. They have identifiable  paymasters who will respond if constant pressure is applied to them. If the  surviving hostages in Lebanon are to be set free, the dialogue of diplomacy  must be kept alive.  </P> <P> The British and American public, unfortunately, are caught up in the same  pathology of frustration. Some call for air strikes. Others succumb to a  strange psychological mechanism that transfers the guilt and tension of the  apparently unsolvable problem onto the hostages.  </P> <P> Before the events of last weekend, the attitude of several Americans who talked  to me was cynical; they had heard that Lt. Col. William R. Higgins was a spy,  and anyone working for the CIA in Lebanon has to take his chances.  </P> <P> I've met the same response campaigning for the freedom of my brother, Roger  Cooper, a British businessman. He was arrested in Tehran in 1985 while working  for McDermott International, an American offshore oil-services group, and he is  still languishing in Tehran's Evin Prison. A senior personnel officer from  McDermott said to me, "Your brother was a spy, wasn't he? I saw his TV  confession." He appeared to be saying that his company didn't care about my  brother because his arrest must have been his own fault.  </P> <P> No one deserves to be kidnaped. To accept the smear stories of the kidnapers is  gullible, weak-kneed Western liberalism at its worst. And to believe an  apparent TV confession, extracted from a prisoner by threat of violence or  worse, is just wrong-headed.  </P> <P> In my brother's case, the Iranians do not even believe their own allegations.  Nearly four years after his arrest, Roger has neither been tried nor convicted.  Nor has his family or government ever been told of a single, specific charge  leveled against him.  </P> <P> The hostage crisis can only be resolved by a long-term political strategy. Iran  learned through defeat in the Gulf War that its foreign policy of xenophobic  isolation did not work. The West's unrelenting diplomatic pressure has borne  fruit, and Iran's foreign-affairs slogan "Neither East nor West" shows signs of  moving toward "Both East and West." Any pro-Western momentum must be nurtured,  not squandered.  </P> <P> It shows incredibly crass political judgment by the Israelis to have chosen  last weekend for their kidnaping raid. On Friday, the Iranians voted Hashemi  Rafsanjani in as president. He no longer has to look over his shoulder to see  what the ayatollah wants. The office of prime minister has been abolished. Yet  before Rafsanjani has begun work with his Cabinet, Israel has muddied the  waters.  </P> <P> Rafsanjani may be president, but his powers are not unlimited. He must maneuver  and lead Iran toward the rapprochement with the West he so badly needs to  rebuild its war-shattered economy. Lebanon is his Achilles heel, since the  Hezbollah zealots are manipulated and financed by his rivals in Iran.  </P> <P> If the present crisis can be peacefully resolved, which is still doubtful,  hopes for the hostages look good. The Iranian regime knows that the price of a  deal with the West is freedom for all Western hostages. A month ago the  Lebanese Hezbollah itself indicated a change of stance, speaking of the  kidnapings as "a very big mistake." And Rafsanjani has expressed "deep regret"  over the reported execution of Col. Higgins.  </P> <P> The stakeout is nearly over. All that is needed is a firm resolve and Iran's  terror-loving, anti-Western hard-liners will lose their last gamble for power.  All's on a knife edge. But we can still see our hostages home for Christmas.  </P></p>

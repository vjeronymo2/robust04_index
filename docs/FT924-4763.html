			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Greatrex succeeds Lynk at UDM MR ROY LYNK, the Nottinghamshire miners' leader who strongly backed government privatisation plans for the coal industry, has been ousted as president of the breakaway Union of Democratic Mineworkers. He was convincingly defeated by Mr Neil Greatrex, the UDM's Nottinghamshire area president, who is expected to take a more sceptical view of privatisation. Mr Greatrex won 2,326 votes to Mr Lynk's 1,586. The turnout was about 4,000 of the union's membership of about 15,000. Mr Greatrex is a more traditional mining industry unionist than Mr Lynk and called recently for a general strike against the pit closures. He stresses, however, that whatever his personal views he will be subject to union policy which supports an active role in the privatisation process. Mr Greatrex also insists that his election will not lead to immediate rapprochement with the National Union of Mineworkers. The NUM claims to be winning members back from the UDM although the UDM denies that. Mr Lynk said after staging a sit-in protest at Silverhill Colliery near Mansfield that he would step down from the presidency in protest at the government's betrayal of his support. But he decided not to withdraw from the election which Mr Greatrex had always been favourite to win. Lawyers acting for the NUM are attempting to obtain government papers concerning the selection of the 10 pits chosen for immediate closure under British Coal's pit closure programme. The move follows claims that selection of the pits resulted from dealing between ministers and Tory backbenchers to avoid a government defeat over the issue rather than assessment of their economic prospects.</p>

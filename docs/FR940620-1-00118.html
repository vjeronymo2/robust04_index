The Access Board has published these revised accessibility guidelines as interim final rules elsewhere in this issue of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> . The proposed rule would also make a conforming change to the Department's rule implementing section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended. The rules would expand the Department's accessibility standards to cover public rights-of-way and other subjects added by the Access Board to its guidelines. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments are requested by August 19, 1994.

Therefore, it is not necessary for any comments submitted to the Board on its proposed or interim rules to be resubmitted to the Department. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Elsewhere in today's  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (ATBCB) is publishing amendments to its accessibility guidelines for buildings and facilities, relating to state and local government facilities. The Department's September 6, 1991, final Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) rule (49 CFR Part 37) adopted the original version of these guidelines, known as the Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG), as its accessibility standards for facilities subject to Part 37. The standards are codified as Appendix A to 49 CFR Part 37. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposed rule would adopt the amended Access Board guidelines as a new Appendix A to Part 37, replacing the Department's current Appendix A. The Access Board received public comments on its proposed guidelines, published on December 21, 1992, and will receive comments again on today's interim final rule. As a member of the Access Board, the Department will be actively involved in the review and analysis of comments the Access Board receives and in making any revisions on the guidelines in response to those comments. Therefore, the Department has proposed to adopt the amended guidelines as its accessibility standards. Comments submitted to the Access Board will be considered by the Department as comments on this proposed rule, and need not be separately submitted to the Department.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consistent with the Department of Justice's existing rule implementing Title II of the ADA, for state and local government facilities, the Department's rule implementing section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (49 CFR Part 27) gives recipients the choice, in some circumstances, of complying either with the ADAAG or with the older Uniform Federal Accessibility Standard (UFAS). In its ADA proposal being published today, DOJ is proposing to eliminate the option to use UFAS. Title II entities would have to use ADAAG in all cases. To remain consistent with Access Board and Department of Justice actions, the Department is also proposing to eliminate the UFAS option. To this end, the Department proposes to revise its 504 rule to require design, construction, or alteration of all facilities subject to Part 27 to conform to the revised AADAG. As a technical amendment, the Department is also proposing to update a reference in Part 27 to Department of Justice ADA regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG -->  <!-- PJG /FTAG --></p>

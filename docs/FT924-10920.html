			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Honduran president tries to heal banana split IN AN apparent effort to ease growing tension between Caribbean and Central American banana exporters over future access to the European market, Mr Rafael Leonardo Callejas, the president of Honduras, has said Latin American producers have no plans to squeeze Caribbean exporters out of their traditional market. Speaking in Jamaica after a state visit, Mr Callejas said his government was aware of the need to protect the 'access' of Caribbean banana producers to the European Community after the creation of a single market in January. He said Latin American exporters wanted to ensure that they would be allowed to benefit from any expansion in consumption in Europe after the Caribbean market was guaranteed. Latin American producers, whose fruit is more price-competitive than that of the traditional suppliers who have had preferential access to the European market, have objected to proposals from the European commission which they say will limit their earnings from Europe. The Latin Americans are arguing in favour of an open market for the fruit, while the Caribbean and other producers want continued guaranteed access and limits on European imports of Latin American bananas. 'We have a lot of potential to expand bananas, but we recognise that this is a very complex matter,' Mr Callejas said. 'We would not like to compete with the Caribbean region because of several reasons, such as our advantage in scale of production. So our effort will be to continue to try to convey this message to the European Community,' the Honduran president said.</p>

Mr Mano Sabnani, managing editor of English and Malay newspapers for Singapore Press Holdings, said that Mr Patrick Daniel, editor of Business Times, associate editor Margaret Thomas, and senior reporter Ms Anna Teo had been taken to the Internal Security Department for questioning. Officers of the department searched the offices of Business Times on Thursday, the Home Affairs Ministry said in a statement. It said an investigation of alleged use of classified information was being conducted under the Official Secrets Act. The investigation appeared to concern a front-page article in the newspaper on June 29 about Singapore's economic performance in the second quarter of the year, Sabnani said. 'The early indications point to a second-quarter growth of 4.6 per cent to 4.8 per cent,' the Business Times article said. The government later released official figures on August 8 giving second-quarter growth as 4.7 per cent.</p>

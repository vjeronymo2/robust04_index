			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / Kohl's party settles on presidency candidate After one false start and months of confusion, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union has agreed on a credible candidate to become German president after Mr Richard von Weizsacker steps down this summer. Mr Roman Herzog, who was nominated at a meeting of the party's national executive committee on Saturday, is president of the federal constitutional court in Karlsruhe, the highest legal authority, and a former CDU interior minister and education minister in Baden-Wurttemberg state. He seems certain to receive the backing of the Bavaria-based Christian Social Union, the CDU's sister party, at a meeting today. Mr Herzog, who is 59, will now face the former Social Democratic party (SPD) leader Mr Johannes Rau, the popular premier of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, in the presidential election, which will be conducted by a 1,324-member electoral college in May. Professor Jens Reich, a founder of the New Forum democratic movement in east Germany, is the only easterner on the slate, as a non-party candidate. Mr Herzog replaces Mr Steffen Heitmann, justice minister of the eastern state of Saxony, as the CDU candidate. The latter was Mr Kohl's favoured candidate, as an easterner who could help bridge divisions in a united Germany, but his conservative views and inexperience instead attracted criticism and widespread ridicule and he pulled out in November. Mr Herzog, in contrast, has a wealth of both political and constitutional experience, as vice-president and then president of the constitutional court since 1983. The outcome of the presidential election depends on the attitude of the Free Democratic party, the junior partner in the Bonn coalition. The FDP has nominated its own candidate, Mrs Hildegard Hamm-Brucher, who is unlikely to withdraw before the third round of voting in the electoral college. The CDU/CSU alliance, with 621 votes in the so-called federal assembly which elects the president on May 23, needs an extra 41 votes for a majority. The SPD has 499 votes, and the FDP 114. If the FDP wishes to preserve its current coalition with the CDU/CSU after next October's general election, the pressure on the party to back Mr Herzog, and not the popular Mr Rau, will be enormous.</p>

			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow follows lower trend for bonds Wall Street US share prices followed bonds lower yesterday, in spite of bullish news on inflation and retail sales, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 6.20 down at 3,842.43. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 slipped 1.70 to 472.47, but the American SE composite edged 0.19 higher to 480.06 and the Nasdaq composite firmed 0.94 to 787.81. NYSE volume amounted to 277.6m shares. Stocks declined for the third consecutive session even though the day's economic news was positive for equities. Government figures showed that consumer prices rose by only 0.2 per cent and retail sales climbed by 0.8 per cent in December. The inflation figure was in line with expectations, while the retail sales number was stronger than forecast by Wall Street analysts. The data should have buoyed stock market sentiment, but investors chose instead to focus on the decline in bond prices. Longer-dated government securities fell because of the retail sales figures, which raised fears that further down the road strong consumer demand might eventually feed through into higher inflation. Additionally, analysts said that investors and traders in New York were unsettled by overnight declines on foreign equity markets, notably Hong Kong, Frankfurt and London. Citicorp was the most actively traded issue, rising Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 40 3/4 , a new 12-month high, in volume of 5.6m shares as the market reacted positively to news of a restructuring and what should be strong fourth-quarter earnings. Another banking stock in demand was JP Morgan, which put on Dollars 3/4 at Dollars 70 3/8 on news of fourth-quarter profits of Dollars 392m, up from Dollars 221m a year earlier. Quaker Oats fell Dollars 3 5/8 to Dollars 65 3/4 after the food group warned the market that it would report a 15 to 20 per cent decline in fiscal second-quarter earnings. Also hit by a profits warning was LA Gear, which dropped Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 8 7/8 after the sports shoe retailer predicted a fourth-quarter loss on continuing operations of about Dollars 15m, and a full-year deficit of more than double that. Bear Stearns rose Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 23 7/8 after the brokerage house reported a 110 per cent jump in October-December earnings to Dollars 134.8m, thanks primarily to sharply higher trading and investment banking revenues. Canada Toronto again showed late strength, the TSE 300 index ending at yet another record high with a rise of 25.2 at 4,479.9. Advances outpaced declines by 443 to 386 after volume of 84.7m shares valued at CDollars 1.1bn. The gold shares index climbed 1.74 per cent as the Comex bullion price rose on fund buying. Financial services added 1.51 per cent.</p>

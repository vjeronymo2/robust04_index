			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei weakens on currency considerations Worries about the yen's continued strength depressed activity, and share prices were hit by arbitrage selling and small-lot, corporate profit-taking, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 average ended 123.53 down at 19,868.87, after a morning high of 20,023.40, and a low of 19,863.27 in the last half-hour of trading as dealers adjusted positions and corporate investors took profits. Most domestic investors remained inactive due to currency fluctuations, while foreigners, who had been buying commodity and basic material related stocks, also held the sidelines. Volume totalled 230m shares, against 255m. The Topix index of all first section stocks receded 6.18 to 1,580.47 and the Nikkei 300 dipped 1.15 to 288.94. Losers led gainers by 677 to 297, with 194 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 3.19 to 1,292.71. The yen fluctuated around the Y97 level against the dollar, in spite of heavy buying of the latter by the Bank of Japan. However, some analysts think the yen will ease following the US elections in November. Credit Suisse Japan expects the dollar to rise after a rate increase by the US Federal Reserve, and expects dollar selling by Japanese exporters to ease in the near term. Export-oriented high-technology stocks lost ground, while speculative favourites were traded actively. Hitachi dipped Y16 to Y994 and Sony lost Y10 at Y5,870. Steels were also hurt by profit-taking. Nippon Steel slipped Y3 to Y387 and Kawasaki Steel Y4 to Y443. Sega Enterprises, the video game maker, fell a further Y50 to Y4,900. Traders said the company's price cut for an electronic game last week discouraged investors, prompting them to sell short. Nippon Kayaku plunged Y67 to Y710 on reports of problems with its cancer drug. Chemical companies, supported by overseas investors last week, were lower on profit-taking. Kureha Chemical shed Y20 to Y540. Speculators supported Mitsubishi Oil on hopes for its oil development project in Vietnam. The stock rose Y20 to Y1,100, while Ensuiko Sugar Refining surged Y180 to Y2,570 on rumours concerning the company's development of a cancer remedy. In Osaka, the OSE average declined 90.92 to 22,235.39 in volume of 26m shares. Roundup The region was still tentative, and mixed. The Pakistan stock market closed without trading in a mark of respect for Mr Aman Manai, general secretary of the Karachi Stock Exchange agents' union, who died in a car crash in Saudi Arabia. SEOUL took profits on fears of a technical correction and the composite index fell 18.53 or 1.7 per cent to 1,094.76. Only a few construction shares and asset-play counters remained popular. Sambu Construction and Hyundai Engineering and Construction each rose Won1,300 to Won39,500 and Won47,500 respectively. HONG KONG fell on the weakness of the US dollar and on fears that the Chinese economy might be out of control. The Hang Seng index closed 98.51 down at 9,320.06 in provisional turnover of HKDollars 2.88bn. Brokers said that investors were waiting for yesterday's US trade figures and today's government land auction. Meanwhile, the China worries coincided oddly with a rise of 8.82 to 1,325.76 in the H-share index of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong, and a SHANGHAI A share gain of 30.40 or 4.8 per cent to 666.62. But brokers said the Shanghai rebound was strictly technical, with turnover thin at Yn1.46bn and market sentiment still weak. TAIPEI declined 1.3 per cent on profit-taking, the weighted index losing 86.43 at 6,669.10, off a 6,817.46 high. Turnover was heavy at TDollars 89.49bn. In SINGAPORE, light profit-taking left the Straits Times Industrial index 19.87 points lower at 2,364.11. SYDNEY rose on firmer futures and late buying interest, the All Ordinaries index finishing 10.0 stronger at 2,013.4 in turnover of ADollars 388m. Brokers said comments by Mr Bernie Fraser, the Reserve Bank governor, on interest rates and inflation had no effect on trading. Oils were firm on recent exploration news, with Woodside up 29 cents at ADollars 5.14 and Santos 8 cents better at ADollars 3.94. WELLINGTON was lifted by a 9-cent advance in Telecom, to NZDollars 5.38, and the NZSE-40 index closed 9.25 higher at 2,061.66 in below-average turnover of NZDollars 26m. MANILA looked for third-quarter earnings prospects and the composite index finished 6.39 ahead at 3,099.34.</p>

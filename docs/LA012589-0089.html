			<p><P> January 25, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin is reportedly considering new measures  to stop the 13-month Palestinian uprising, including blocking Arabs suspected  of taking part in riots from entering Israel to work. Jobs in Israel are the  main source of income for an estimated 100,000 people in the occupied West Bank  and Gaza Strip. Rabin called the work a "privilege, not a right." Meanwhile,  Israeli soldiers killed a Palestinian teen-ager in a pre-dawn raid, and  security agents arrested dozens of Arabs suspected of belonging to the  underground Palestinian Popular Army. Israel Radio said the group is led by the  Fatah faction of the Palestine Liberation Organization.  </P></p>

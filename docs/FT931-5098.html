			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / Arts: La Favorite - Opera When so much about Welsh National Opera's new production of Donizetti's Favorite is regrettable - singing, musical preparation, production - it may seem perverse to start out on the matter of the Italian text that the company has elected to sing. But since this seems to me symptomatic of the central failure of artistic nerve that characterises this important revival, I make no excuse for doing so. La Favorite (1840) is a French grand opera, the second that Donizetti wrote for Paris. It was regularly performed in that city until 1918, and thereafter kept a toe-hold on the international repertory in Italian translation; but, as every Donizettian knows who has ever compared the two versions even briefly, the standard Italian Favorite text is a ghastly botch-up of the original. WNO's general administrator, Matthew Epstein, is well aware of the overriding argument for performing the opera in its original language (as I know from correspondence with him); its musical director and Favorite conductor, Carlo Rizzi, admitted on the latest edition of Radio 3's Opera News that he would have preferred to do Favorite in French. So what happened to sway the company's two head-men against their own better judgment? Enter at this point the Peter Moores Foundation, which has funded the production, and which in the WNO Favorite programme offers the lame rationale that 'the (opera's) surviving performance tradition is in Italy and America, where it is always sung in Italian'. What this has to do with the work's revival in Cardiff, and with a cast entirely made up of anglophone singers all taking their roles for the first time, escapes me completely. If the Peter Moores Foundation had also stumped up sufficient cash to pay for Italian stars (Cecilia Bartoli and Giuseppe Sabbatini, say, or even Pavarotti) there would have been some sense in a WNO Italian-language Favorite. At least the foundation has, for the occasion, also undertaken a revision of the Italian version, which eradicates the notorious narrative nonsenses of the standard Italian text (the process of transforming Favorite into Favorita ran up against Italian censorship of the mid-19th century, which turned a rigorous gaze on religion and historical personages in opera, and which in this case resulted in garbled points of plot and character). But this hardly settles the worrying basic question of sponsors exerting influence on a national company's artistic policy. Does language really matter? La Favorite is a noble, serious opera - about the struggle between sacred and profane love undergone by the central figure, Fernand (tenor) - in a consciously mastered French style. In his works for Paris, Donizetti aimed high, and specifically: the forms are large in scale, the orchestration is careful, and the vocal writing (bar a few rum-ti-tum strettas) is severely simplified, achieving in solo and duet a spacious singing style that was to have a powerful impact on Verdi. The French words are clean-cut and cleanly meshed with the vocal line; in Italian, and particularly in the very indifferent Italian on offer here, the effect is constantly fuzzed up. The larger point about the Cardiff Favorite performance is that a little-known but significant opera is made to seem second-rate: stiffer, less 'animally' alive in its musico-dramatic compound than Lucia and Lucrezia Borgia, and cardboard-y in its characters and situations. In the New Theatre on Friday the music was at once crudely shaped and loudly belted. In the fascinating title-role - mistress of the king, Fernand's guilty, unhappy lover - the Australian mezzo-soprano Bernadette Cullen gave notice of a strong, well-schooled instrument but almost no notion of bel canto style. Ditto the Fernand of Bonaventura Bottone, the ENO's much-admired character tenor. The remainder ranged from the just-acceptable to the mediocre. The conductor, who failed to instil respect for dynamic markings in his singers, secured fleet orchestral playing but little sense of larger movement. Rennie Wright's production is 'modern' in a competently second-hand fashion: stepped basic set, symbolic props, gauze, the all-too-familiar production lingua franca of the 1970s. What a disappointment] New Theatre, Cardiff, then on tour to eight cities, including two performances in WNO's April residence at Covent Garden.</p>

In April, 1990, Pudong was listed by the Chinese central  government as a development zone open to the outside world. In  May 1992 the State Council put forward the strategy of making  Pudong as the lead to promote economic development of the Chang  Jiang River Valley. Since then, the provinces along the Chang  Jiang, including Jiangsu, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan and  Sichuan, have all taken the opportunity to speed up their own  economic growth.    By the end of 1993, these provinces had set up more than 300  agencies in Shanghai and nearly 2,000 enterprises from these  provinces registered in the city have gone into operation,  according to an official from the office of cooperation and  coordination under the municipal government.    In Pudong alone, the official said, about ten buildings with  a total investment of two billion yuan (230 million U.S.  dollars) have been jointly built by these provinces and  Shanghai. Besides, over 600 construction teams from these  provinces have been working in Shanghai.    In 1993, 4.5 million tons of materials and commodities from  Jiangsu Province was transferred at Shanghai. The province had  also 760,000 tons of goods exported through Shanghai port. The  value of materials Shanghai transferred for Hunan Province  reached 65 million yuan.    Various specialized markets established in Shanghai in  recent  years have become springboards for the provinces along the Chang  Jiang to enter domestic and international markets. Among the  members of the ten big commodity exchanges in Shanghai, such as  for metals, petroleum and building materials, who came from  outside Shanghai, nearly half came from the six provinces along  the Chan Jiang.    In addition, the stocks of 13 enterprises in the six  provinces have been listed in the Shanghai Securities Exchange  so far. In 1993, Shanghai's funds markets helped to provide the  provinces with nearly 10 billion yuan (1.2 billion U.S. dollars).    By the end of 1993, Shanghai had invested 500 million yuan  in  building centers of raw materials in the provinces along the  Chang Jiang and in supporting them to produce parts of the  "Santana" sedan car for the car's chief plant in Shanghai.    Hunan Province alone has signed with Shanghai contracts on  over 500 cooperative projects. It has made use of 34 million  yuan of funds and over 500 technical workers from Shanghai.  These projects have helped Hunan Province to increase output  value by 270 million yuan and additional pre-tax profits of 30  million yuan.    Huang Ju, mayor of Shanghai, said recently that Shanghai  would further expand its economic and technical cooperation with  the provinces along the Chang Jiang in 1994.</p>

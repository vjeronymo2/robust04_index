			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / Structural barriers to eastward enlargement THE COMBINATION of Europe's deepening recession and the collapse of the hard version of the exchange rate mechanism in July appear effectively to have placed the final nail in the coffin of the Maastricht treaty. Europe badly needs to take a new economic direction, but no one seems to know what it should be. But there is one option which most EC member countries appear determined to rule out: enlargement to the east. A senior diplomat from one of the EC's largest southern European member countries confirmed last week both that the Maastricht timetable for monetary union was impossible but that his country had no option but to try to stick to it. As for switching the agenda from monetary deepening to membership widening, his response was an emphatic No. At first sight, the reason for this adamant opposition to eastward enlargement seems obvious. Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary are all endowed with cheap and relatively skilled labour. They thus seem to pose a threat to industrial competitiveness in Spain, Greece, Portugal and Ireland, especially if the potentially highly restrictive east European Association Agreements were to be replaced by full membership of the Single Market. But the view that the southern European countries stand to be hurt more if trade with the east is liberalised is misconceived, as the European Commission has highlighted in a recent study. In fact, the research, conducted by National Economic Research Associates, the London-based consultancy, finds that the Community's 'lagging' regions (Greece, Portugal, the Irish republic, Northern Ireland, southern Italy and most of Spain) stand to gain most from successful reform in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. In the short-term, the Commission report estimates that the EC area would be a net loser from open trade if reforms succeeded, although the fall in output would be a tiny 0.2 per cent. As east European imports of manufactures and agricultural goods grew, so the net impact of open manufacturing trade would turn positive, and outweigh agricultural losses. By the year 2010, the report estimates total EC output would have risen 0.8 per cent. But the poorer, lagging, regions are net beneficiaries from the beginning, with Greece, southern Italy and Spain reaping most of the benefits. Output is projected to rise for all the main categories of manufactures in the lagging regions, with the exception of iron and steel. And the projected gains in manufacturing output are substantial - 0.4 per cent by 1995 and 2.2 per cent by 2010. For Spain and Portugal, this relative success is almost entirely explained by a mix of industries and products which are better suited to the import needs of the east European countries. For Greece, this industry effect is supplemented by its geographical proximity to the emerging markets. Why then are the southern European countries so opposed to eastward enlargement, and determined to stick to the Maastricht timetable? The reason is the EC's Ecu157bn (Pounds 120bn) aid budget. Over the period 1994-99 the EC plans to distribute Ecu141.5bn in structural funds to the EC's backward regions. A further Ecu15.5bn should be paid out by 1999 to Ireland, Spain, Portugal and Greece through the cohesion fund as compensation for signing the Maastricht treaty. But allowing the east or central European countries to join the Community would undermine southern Europe's claim on this aid budget, while recognising that the Maastricht timetable is dead removes the rationale for the cohesion funds. The risk for the EC is that locking the east European countries out may mean an even larger aid burden if reforms fail. But this is a threat that the southern European countries appear unwilling to contemplate. Trade and foreign investment in the Community's regions: the impact of reform in central and eastern Europe.

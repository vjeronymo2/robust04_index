			<p><P> April 22, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOCIAL SECURITY UNDER FIRE FOR ROUTING CALLERS TO OFFICES THAT CAN'T HELP THEM  </P> <P> The Social Security Administration's national toll-free number becomes so  overloaded on busy days that many calls from Los Angeles are routed to  Pittsburgh, where no service operators speak Spanish, and calls from  Pennsylvania coal miners about black-lung benefits are shifted to New Jersey,  where the topic is a mystery, a congressional hearing was told Friday.  </P> <P> "You can always tell when an employee in my office has a Spanish (speaking)  caller because they talk extra loud," said Joy Sloan, a Social Security service  representative from Pittsburgh. "It's a frustrating and impossible task" when  20% of the calls dialed in the Los Angeles region between 2 and 3 p.m. are  shifted to Pittsburgh on busy days, she told the House Aging Committee.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Work Force Being Cut  </P> <P> The Social Security Administration has been reducing its work force for five  years, and last October it initiated a national toll-free service to maximize  the use of available operators. In most parts of the country, Social Security  abolished the local telephone numbers for its offices, replacing them with the  single toll-free number, 1-800-234-5772.  </P> <P> When calls in one place get backed up, they can be routed automatically to any  of the 37 tele-service centers.  </P> <P> However, the result is sometimes not hometown-like service.  </P> <P> "I'm not satisfied," said Rep. Edward R. Roybal (D-Los Angeles), the committee  chairman, angered because he had previously been assured by Social Security  officials that bilingual telephone service representatives would be on duty  throughout the country. "I want to see them in place in 30 days," he said in an  interview after the hearing.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Used by Beneficiaries  </P> <P> The nationwide line is used by persons seeking information about retirement and  disability benefits, complaining about checks that did not arrive and arranging  appointments at local offices.  </P> <P> On seven heavy calling days in March and five in April, 20% of the calls made  in the Los Angeles region between 2 and 3 p.m. were routed to Pittsburgh  operators. "Numerous calls from Spanish-speaking callers" could not be handled  because no one in that office speaks Spanish, Sloan said.  </P> <P> Nor are there Spanish-speaking operators at service centers in St. Louis,  Parlin, N. J., and Upper Darby, Pa., even though the Pennsylvania office must  handle overflow calls from Miami, Roybal said.  </P> <P> Also, backed-up calls from Pennsylvania have been switched to the New Jersey  office, which "has led to much bad and erroneous information" being given to  miners, Sloan said. "Pittsburgh (representatives) know the black lung program,  Parlin does not."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Problems to Be Corrected  </P> <P> Social Security officials defended the telephone program, insisting that it  generally has improved service to the 38 million beneficiaries. Problems caused  by switching calls to inappropriate centers "will be corrected," Jack McHale,  project director for the telephone program, told the hearing.  </P> <P> Herbert R. Doggette Jr., deputy commissioner for operations, said that start-up  problems "might be expected in any undertaking of this magnitude."  </P> <P> Social Security offices "are now offering interviews by appointment to reduce  waiting times, experimenting with extended office hours and offering to conduct  most Social Security business over the telephone if a claimant or beneficiary  prefers," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cites High Phone Use  </P> <P> Doggette said that about 50% of Social Security claims are now "taken over the  telephone by local offices versus only 15% in 1986, and in some areas over 80%  of claims are filed by telephone."  </P> <P> He cited recent studies by the General Accounting Office showing a high level  of public satisfaction with Social Security services.  </P> <P> Roybal released a survey showing dissatisfaction and low morale among workers  at five Social Security offices in the Los Angeles area. A majority of the 101  respondents said that their offices had insufficient staff.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Poorer Service Claimed  </P> <P> Roybal and another committee member, Rep. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), said the quality  of service is suffering as Social Security reaches its goal of cutting its  payroll by 17,000 workers during a five-year period. The current budget calls  for elimination of 2,000 jobs by attrition during fiscal 1990.  </P> <P> Ernesto Graham, who worked in the Social Security Administration for 14 years,  told the committee that he resigned this month from the Boyle Heights office in  Los Angeles in frustration over an "intolerable" working environment.  </P> <P> Personnel turnover is very high, and there is a shortage of secretaries and  claims representatives, Graham said. "In the past three or four years, the job  has changed dramatically for the worse," he said.  </P></p>

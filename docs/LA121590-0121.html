			<p><P> December 15, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT / CLASSICAL MUSIC / KENNETH HERMAN: VERSATILE PLAYER TURNS  OUT AN 18TH-CENTURY GLASS ACT  </P> <P> Theater organist Dennis James is well known to the regulars of the San Diego  Symphony's Nickelodeon series.  </P> <P> The lanky musician with the permanent grin has accompanied every silent film at  Copley Symphony Hall since the orchestra inaugurated the series in January,  1988, with a screening of Douglas Fairbanks' "Robin Hood."  </P> <P> But what most of the local silent movie fans don't know is that James is also a  world-class virtuoso on the glass armonica and the theremin, an early  electronic instrument.  </P> <P> This armonica is composed of a series of bell-shaped glasses on a revolving  horizontal axis, with each glass providing a different note. The sound is made  by a moistened finger touching the edge of a turning glass.  </P> <P> "Some people refer to these as oddball instruments, but I prefer to categorize  them as unusual instruments," said James, who is in town to accompany a Laurel  and Hardy short, "Selling Christmas Trees in Southern California" on the  symphony's holiday WinterPops concerts at 8 p.m. today and Sunday.  </P> <P> "I see my interest in the glass armonica and other forgotten instruments as a  natural outgrowth of my work on the theater organ."  </P> <P> Over the past decade, film buffs and musicians have eagerly restored old silent  film prints and unearthed the musical scores and cue sheets that have made it  possible to present these pioneer cinema efforts in their proper original  ethos. Once sound tracks were added to motion pictures, of course, theater  organs and the obligatory pit orchestras in urban movie palaces had become  obsolete by the early 1930s.  </P> <P> "The further away we get from the actual era," James explained, "the greater  the impetus is to restore instruments to their original function."  </P> <P> During his 15 years as resident organist of the Ohio Theatre in Columbus, a  post he left a year ago, James honed his accompanying technique and acquired a  substantial repertory of scores for silent films.  </P> <P> "People are always saying that 90% of the old silent films were lost, but it is  also true that a large percentage of the really good films were preserved. I  have been able to find either cue sheets or actual scores for most of these 'A'  films. From the music I now have, I can play another five seasons of silent  films without repeating any I've done so far."  </P> <P> Next year's plethora of Mozart festivals to mark the bicentennial of the  composer's death has turned into a bonanza of concert dates for James and his  glass armonica. A popular instrument in the late 18th Century invented by Ben  Franklin, the glass armonica caught the fancy of a number of European  composers, including Mozart. He wrote a solo piece for the musical glasses, as  the instrument is sometimes called, and a more extended chamber opus, "Adagio  and Rondo in C Minor," K. 617, for glass armonica, flute, oboe, violin and  cello.  </P> <P> In 1982, when James first began to teach himself to play the glass armonica, he  thought there was little repertory for the obscure instrument, but he has been  able to turn up more than 500 pieces that require Franklin's musical invention.  </P> <P> "Even Mozart's orchestration of Handel's 'Messiah' calls for the glass  armonica," James noted.  </P> <P> James' concert travels during the Mozart bicentennial year will take him to  festivals in Australia and New Zealand as well as Europe. He is particularly  eager to perform the "Adagio and Rondo" with original instrument guru Roger  Norrington and his London Classical Players in identical all-Mozart programs in  London's Queen Elizabeth Hall and New York's Lincoln Center.  </P> <P> "I can't explain it, but the glass armonica has really caught on in France and  in Italy. After I played in it Paris a couple of years ago, Bernard Raffielli  of the Sorbonne decided to write a play set in the 18th Century in which I  perform on the glass harmonica. He sent me the script, but when the producers  realized how execrable my French was, the playwright made my character a mute.  We've performed the play 'Glass Music' in Nantes, Nancy and Angoulem. And, on  my next trip to France, we will tape it for French television."  </P> <P> To keep in practice, James carries one of his glass armonicas with him when  traveling. The delicate nature of the instrument's sound makes it possible for  him to practice in his hotel room when he's not involved in orchestra  rehearsals. He keeps his two other glass armonicas packed away in  earthquake-proof crating in his Berkeley home.  </P> <P> James will return to San Diego next month (Jan 4, 8 p.m.) to accompany the  symphony's next Nickelodeon series offering, the 1920 classic silent film "Way  Down East," starring Lillian Gish.  </P> <P> Nautical but nice. Leon Natker, director of San Diego Comic Opera, announced a  unique performance of Gilbert and Sullivan's operetta "H.M.S. Pinafore" to be  presented the summer of 1992 on the Star of India. The historic sailing ship  will then be permanently moored on the Broadway pier, on which bleachers will  be built for the audience. The company players will use the 19th-Century ship  as their stage and set, aided by some distinctly 20th-Century amplification.  The production will be a joint effort of San Diego Comic Opera and the San  Diego Maritime Museum, which maintains the Star of India.  </P> <P> Even more opera. San Diego Opera has announced additional performances of  Mozart's "Cosi Fan Tutte" (Jan. 30), Strauss' "Die Fledermaus" (March 13) and  Verdi's "La Traviata" (May 11). Each of these operas will have five  performances, with the best seats available on the added dates. Single tickets  for all of the local company's 1991 season are now sale at the Civic Center box  office, 202 C St., and all TicketMaster locations.  </P> <P> For the May 11 "La Traviata" performance, San Diego Opera general director has  announced the following cast changes: American soprano Frances Ginsberg will  sing the title roles, replacing Christine Weidinger; tenor Walter MacNeil will  replace Fernando de la Mora as Alfredo Germont, and baritone Richard J. Clark  will replace Richard Stilwell as Giorgio Germont.  </P> <P> Military salute. The San Diego Symphony is offering 300 free tickets to  Sunday's "Holiday Delights!" concert to all military personnel and family  members. The free passes will be given out on a first-come basis starting at 4  p.m. at the Copley Symphony Hall box office. (One ticket will be given for each  military identification card presented.) The 8 p.m. concert will feature the  San Diego Symphony and the St. Paul's Boys Choir under guest conductor Carl  Hermanns.  </P></p>

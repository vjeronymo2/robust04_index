Nevertheless, his support  for the UN/NATO ultimatum based on a French initiative came  fairly quickly.    People are still asking what the reasons for this decision  were. Was it increasing pressure from the Islamic states,  Egypt's cooperation with Paris, the rapidly progressing economic  destabilization of Bosnia's neighbors? Or was it the fact that  the leadership of the last superpower was being questioned?  There are a number of open questions.    Alarmed at the expansionary tendencies of Russia, which is  obligated to the Serbs, the East European states increasingly  are concerned by the negative effects the continuing civil war  has on the economy. Beside the cutting off of regional trade  relations and the drying up of investments, Washington is  becoming concerned about a threatening loss of confidence. Word  has got round that a passive and leaderless West will also be  asked to pay up.    For the first time, the White House, after advocating  lifting  Bosnian weapons embargo in vain, is actively trying to achieve a  political solution. Against this background, Clinton encouraged  the Bosnian Muslims to accept certain modifications in the  Geneva peace talks. Now it will be the U.S. emissary's special  task to examine the demands of the besieged.    In the meantime, Washington knows that it is absolutely  necessary to establish a balance of power in former Yugoslavia.  The U.S. Congress has been assured by the Clinton  administration that cooperation with the French and a  demonstration of solidarity within NATO are the best way to  solve the Bosnian dilemma. The argument that no U.S. interests  are endangered in Sarajevo is rapidly weakened by the horror  scenes shown on the world's television screens every day.    Even if, due to the difficulties on the ground, the Pentagon  remains skeptical about the French military plans, the White  House acknowledges that in terms of U.S. foreign policy the  conflict has long since extended beyond its regional aspect. In  order to avoid political escalation following a military one,  Clinton is keeping to his dual strategy of political compromise  and military pressure. The fact that this change in policy  makes it increasingly difficult for the United States to  maintain the necessary neutrality makes a success of the  ultimatum all the more urgently required.</p>

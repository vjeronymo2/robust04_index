"No accord will be reached between the two sides and the  Palestinian delegation will ask to leave for Tunis for  consultation with the PLO leadership," a source close to the  negotiations told AFP.    King Husayn had described the talks here as a "last chance"  to mend ties between the two sides.    A Jordanian official told AFP that Jordan feared that  'Arafat  "is giving priority to Palestinian-Israeli cooperation rather  than to that with Jordan" and would blame the PLO leader if the  talks here failed.    The source close to the talks said that 'Arafat's choosing  Faruq Qaddumi instead of Mahmud 'Abbas to head the negotiations  here "shows his determination to gain time without making firm  commitments."    Unlike Qaddumi who disagreed with the Israeli-PLO peace  deal,  'Abbas signed the accord in Washington and is directly involved  in all autonomy-related negotiations.    The two days of talks focused on how to boost coordination  on  banking in the territories, the issues of Jerusalem, water, and  refugees as well as on the PLO-Israeli negotiations, Jordanian  Information Minister Jawad al-'Anani said.    The talks "will continue until both sides reach decisive  results," al-'Anani said earlier.    King Husayn on Saturday gave the Palestine Liberation  Organization until Tuesday to begin a "serious" dialogue on  improving coordination, after the PLO had failed to sign an  economics agreement that has been ready for two months.    The agreement is aimed at setting up Jordanian banks in the  occupied Gaza Strip and West Bank.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Reports of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's  alleged "remark on his wish to resign" circulated immediately  among the ruling coalition parties on the evening of 5 April,  causing serious repercussions.    Since the reported remark came at a time when the schedule  of  the lower house Budget Committee's deliberation of the draft  1994 budget remained undecided, some ruling party members were  even suspicious of the prime minister's true intention. On the  other hand, rumors are rife in both the ruling and opposition  parties that if deliberations on the budget remain suspended,  "the cabinet may be forced to resign en masse, or the lower  house may be dissolved to give way to a general election."  While ruling party members are generally negative about Diet  dissolution because Diet deliberations are actually being  stalled over the prime minister's personal problem, this  "resignation remark" may serve to encourage the opinion that the  cabinet should resign to take responsibility for failing to  steer Diet affairs properly.    The ruling parties' reaction to the prime minister's remark  was a mixture of perplexity and shock. The Prime Minister's  Office was swamped with phone calls trying to confirm the  reports on the evening of 5 April. Deputy Chief Cabinet  Secretary Yukio Hatoyama was summoned in haste to the Prime  Minister's Official Residence at midnight, and the secretaries  concerned were also rushing in and out. In the early hours of 6  April, the prime minister denied having made the "resignation  remark." The government and the ruling parties then  concentrated their efforts on informing all concerned that "the  prime minister did not make the remark," and on restoring calm.    In the first place, when senior Social Democratic Party of  Japan [SDPJ] officials heard about the reports on the  "resignation remark," they pointed out, "That is inconceivable.  The worst thing is for such reports to go out of control."  Other SDPJ officials were evidently shocked. They said, "We  are in for trouble from 6 April."    Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] members expressed concern  over the effect, saying "This is different from an ordinary  joke; it may lead to a surprise outcome."    Since the prime minister is supposed to have made the remark  during a dinner, most ruling party members said that "we do not  think he was serious." Because the people he talked to were  opposition upper house members, a senior Shinseito official  said, "These are people the prime minister does not usually talk  to, so we are not even sure how he talked to them." He doubted  if there was actually any "resignation remark."    As the prime minister's alleged remark has already been made  public, "the prime minister's authority" will surely suffer the  more he and his aides deny such reports. Moreover, this  unwittingly revealed the prime minister's lack of confidence  over his Sagawa Kyubin affair. The Liberal Democratic Party is  expected to intensify its efforts to "overthrow the cabinet."    The prime minister's alleged remark indeed came as a great  surprise, whether or not he meant what he said. This  "resignation remark" has surely become another explosive issue  in his management of the political situation.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Past Performance of an Institution or Persons Affiliated With An Institution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary proposes to remove from the factors of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financial responsibility the provisions in current &sect;668.13 (c)(4)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and (d)(2) governing the effect on an institution's financial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibility of criminal conduct and fraud involving Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> funds. Those provisions have been superseded by a similar  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statutory provision that is addressed in the discussion on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed &sect;668.14 governing program participation agreements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under proposed &sect;668.15(c)(2), an institution would not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered financially responsible, despite meeting all other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements of this proposed section, if: (1) The institution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has been limited, suspended, terminated, or entered into a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> settlement agreement, to resolve such an action by the Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or a guaranty agency within the preceding five years; (2) the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution had an audit finding during its two most recent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> audits, or a program review finding during its two most recent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program reviews, that resulted in the institution's being  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to repay an amount greater than five percent of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Title IV, HEA funds that the institution received for any award  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year covered by the audit or the program review; or (3) the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution failed to address satisfactorily any compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> problems identified in program review or audit reports based upon  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a final decision of the Secretary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The consequences of this proposed provision are described  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more fully earlier in this preamble in the discussion on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisional certification. Essentially, institutions that fall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> into one of these categories not only would not be considered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financially responsible, but could not be provisionally certified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> without the submission of certain financial guarantees or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> personal assumptions of liability arising from participation in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Title IV, HEA programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Exceptions to the General Standards of Financial Responsibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Amendments of 1992, as amended by the Technical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Amendments of 1993, provide that the Secretary shall determine an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution to be financially responsible even though it does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meet certain general standards of financial responsibility, under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> various conditions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 498(c)(5)(B) of the HEA provides that the Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shall establish a process whereby an institution is exempt from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the cash reserve requirement if the institution is located in,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and is legally authorized to operate within, a State that has a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tuition recovery fund that ensures that the institution is able  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to pay all required refunds and the institution contributes to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that tuition recovery fund. The Secretary proposes that an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution is exempt from the proposed cash reserve requirement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if it meets these conditions; however, the Secretary proposes to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stipulate that a State's tuition recovery fund must be acceptable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the Secretary. The Secretary would like to ensure that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State's tuition recovery fund truly has the resources to ensure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payment of all required refunds if necessary. To this end, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary would expect States to provide as much information as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possible to demonstrate that their tuition recovery fund can pay  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all required refunds on behalf of an institution that closed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> precipitously. The Secretary invites comment on what specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards should be used to measure the acceptability of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State's tuition recovery fund.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 498(c)(3) of the HEA provides that an institution is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financially responsible even though it does not meet the other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> general standards of financial responsibility, under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following circumstances. First, an institution that is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financially responsible under the general standards of financial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibility (except the cash reserve requirement) is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financially responsible if the institution submits to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary third-party financial guarantees, such as performance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bonds or letters of credit payable to the Secretary, that equal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not less than one-half of the annual potential Title IV, HEA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program liabilities of the institution. The Secretary proposes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that a letter of credit that is payable to the Secretary and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective for a period of time as determined by the Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be the only acceptable type of third-party guarantee for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this requirement. The determination by the Secretary that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payment from a third-party guarantee requires that funds become  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> immediately available to make refunds or to reimburse the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary for debts incurred in the programs. It has been the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary's experience that letters of credit are the only method  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by which funds do become immediately available; however, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary requests comments on other standard forms of publicly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guaranteed security that would provide the same level of security  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the Secretary. The Secretary notes that an institution is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> liable for all mishandled Title IV, HEA program funds that it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receives. Further, the Secretary believes that the total Title  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> IV, HEA program funds received by an institution during the last  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complete award year is the best indicator of the amount of Title  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> IV, HEA program assistance that the institution will receive for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the next award year. Therefore, the Secretary proposes to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require an institution to submit a letter of credit equal to not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> less than one-half of the Title IV, HEA program funds received by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the institution during the last complete award year for which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> figures are available in order to meet this requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

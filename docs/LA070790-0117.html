			<p><P> July 7, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEW;  </P> <P> MONTREAL FESTIVAL TOUCHES ALL THE BASES;  </P> <P> MUSIC: FROM INSTRUMENTALS TO VOCALS, FROM CONTEMPORARY TO LATIN TO THE BLUES,  NO IDIOM REMAINED UNTAPPED.  </P> <P> The embarrassment of riches at the Festival International de Jazz leaves no  idiom untapped. Typically, though contemporary jazz is strongly represented (by  Elvin Jones, Arthur Blythe, McCoy Tyner, Archie Shepp and dozens more),  traditional sounds such as the blues are not ignored; in fact, one outdoor  stage is devoted to daily blues sessions, mainly by French Canadian groups  (despite such names as The Okazoo Blues Band), while Robert Cray, Dr. John and  Wilson Pickett have filled indoor halls.  </P> <P> Much ingenuity has been shown in mixing Canadian and American talent. The  Modern Jazz Quartet joined forces with a Canadian string quartet, the Quatuor  Morency. Thursday evening the vocal-and-bass duo of Sheila Jordan and Harvey  Swartz shared a show with singer Karen Young and bassist Michel Donato, a  Quebec couple who have carried the same idea much further: they both sing; they  have a fresher, bolder (and bilingual) repertoire, and Young's voice is strong  and assured. Score one for Canada. Late in the show they switched partners;  finally all four got together for a joyous two-voice, two-bass hit.  </P> <P> The Latin temperament, a product of the sharp increase in the Spanish speaking  population here, has been nourished daily by Hilton Ruiz, Milton Nascimento,  Chick Corea and, most memorably, by singer Celia Cruz, the Cuban-born salsa  spitfire who, despite a shower that became a heavy storm Tuesday evening, drew  a crowd estimated at 75,000 to a two block area in the Boulevard Rene Levesque.  </P> <P> On a stage decorated with the flags of Mexico, Cuba and Panama, Cruz shared her  program with the Venezuelan singer Oscar d'Leon and a 15-piece band. This was  basically dance music, but dancing became a bit awkward amid a sea of  umbrellas. A jazz interlude was inserted when the saxophonists David (Fathead)  Newman and Chico Freeman soloed powerfully on "Blue Bossa."  </P> <P> A cornucopia of pianists Wednesday found Keith Jarrett's recital coinciding  with that of Michel Camilo, a virtuoso from the Dominican Republic. We chose  Camilo, who is extraordinary but extravagant; his concert was almost literally  a smashing success, as he used formidable technique to pound his way through  original pieces such as the Latinesque "Island Stomp." The brute-force formula  works for him; he had the crowd in an uproar, but his subtler side (displayed  in his own gentle "Dans l'Amour") was too seldom heard, and the excesses  extended to his bassist and the laborious drummer.  </P> <P> At an adjoining theater a little later, the Americans Kirk Lightsey and Harold  Danko (both Chet Baker alumni) formed a piano duo that aimed not at the jugular  like Camilo, but at the mind and heart. Their cohesion is fantastic. It is as  if some higher power were controlling these four hands, making them move as  one.  </P> <P> The program consisted mainly of intricately arranged tunes by Wayne Shorter  ("Anamaria," "Iris," "Pinocchio"); even when they played a Danko original it  was entitled "Wayne Shorter." The first 45 minutes was spellbinding, but as  time wore on the persistent sound of two pianos began to wear thin.  </P> <P> Most rewarding of all was Tommy Flanagan's late evening appearance at the  Nouveau Monde Theatre. Here was the perfect formula: much better (an  Ellington-Strayhorn medley), much bebop (tunes by Gillespie, Parker, Thad  Jones, J.J. Johnson), and no bombast. In George Mraz he has the Tommy Flanagan  of the bass, whose every solo is a melodic marvel. The wit and empathy of the  drummer Lewis Nash rounded out this spirited trio.  </P> <P> Among the Canadians heard at free concerts in and around the Rue Ste. Catherine  were Sylvain Provost, a Pat Metheny inspired guitarist, whose quartet played in  a large tent off the street; Hans Leveille, a graduate of Los Angeles' Guitar  Institute, whose sextet pumped out heavy-handed fusion in a giant four-story  shopping mall; and Streetnix, heard in open air concerts at the Place des Arts.  Patterned after the Dirty Dozen Band from New Orleans (they are also in the  festival), Streetnix used an incongruous old time set-up (tuba, trumpet, drums,  and two young women playing alto sax and trombone) to play tunes by Mingus,  Bird and Monk. Amazingly, it worked.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Raquel Abecassis on news conference </F> by Manuel Dias Loureiro, minister of internal administration, in  Lisbon on 23 May -- passages within quotation marks recorded]    [Excerpts] The head of the Portuguese secret services [SIS]  has resigned. The minister for internal administration has  already accepted the resignation and announced it a little while  ago at a news conference. In addition, Dias Loureiro has  dismissed Joao Evangelista, the Madeira regional director of  SIS. All this follows the outcome of an inquiry carried out by  the parliamentary monitoring committee that looked into the work  of the secret services in Madeira. Dias Loureiro read,  appraised, and decided. A few moments ago, the minister  announced the resignation of Ladeiro Monteiro and the dismissal  of Joao Evangelista. Raquel Abecassis reports.    [Abecassis] Dias Loureiro has a week to study the results of  a report that, despite not proving the existence of recent  investigations into magistrates in Madeira, proved that the SIS  in Madeira did carry out highly irregular activities.    [Loureiro] "However, the monitoring council's report  recognizes that something, or some things, included in the  reports I looked at that were sent by SIS Madeira to central SIS  have gone beyond the legal jurisdiction of the SIS."    [Abecassis] The minister said this was a serious affair, and  to make things clear he announced one resignation and one  dismissal.    [Loureiro] "Hence, I have decided to dismiss, as of today,  the regional director of SIS Madeira, who is the SIS regional  delegate in that autonomous region. In the meantime, SIS  Director General Ladeiro Monteiro has tendered his resignation.  He believes that, despite not being directly responsible for  the reports, he had suggested the appointment of the regional  director of the SIS. Therefore, he felt objectively responsible  and decided to resign. This is a gesture I praise because it is  a very dignified gesture."    [Abecassis] [passage omitted] As for the alleged involvement  of SIS in the bugging of the attorney general's office, Dias  Loureiro said that there was no proof so far. Just to be on the  safe side, however, the monitoring council would follow events  closely and could open another investigation into SIS activities.    [Loureiro] "The monitoring council has every power to  monitor  SIS activities. I, for one, would like the monitoring council  to do so every time it feels it is justified, whether in  connection with this affair or other issues. The monitoring  council is not the main body in charge of monitoring, or rather,  in charge of the inquiry into the appearance of a bugging device  in the attorney general's office. As you know, it is the police  who are in charge of this.... Besides, there is no proof of the  SIS's involvement at the moment. The monitoring council said in  its report that it wishes to follow this matter closely. It has  not asked for special resources. It shall have them when it  does."    [Abecassis] Dias Loureiro expressed total confidence in the  mechanisms set up to monitor the SIS. He also clearly  reiterated his confidence in the activities of the secret  services.    [Loureiro] "I maintain my confidence. I have no reason not  to do so. I also saw with my own eyes what happened regarding  the reports from Madeira, and I want to make this clear.  Obviously, I am not going to reveal their content. It was not  a case of investigations as such, however, but it was more like  a news report, here and there, opinions that, indeed, are not  the job of the secret services. What I said is that there must  be strict compliance with the law in these matters. Even though  it was just news -- who said what, what is being said -- even  this goes beyond the jurisdiction of the SIS. There is no room  for ambiguity in these matters. There must be strict compliance  with the law. Therefore, I decided to relieve the director  general of the SIS from his post." [passage omitted]</p>

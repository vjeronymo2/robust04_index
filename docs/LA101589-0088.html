			<p><P> October 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ABORTION DEBATE FINDS THE APPROPRIATE STAGE;  </P> <P> STATES: COMPETING MORAL CLAIMS CAN BEST BE RESOLVED BY POLITICAL ARGUMENT. WHAT  BETTER PLACE TO DECIDE THEM THAN THE LEGISLATURES.  </P> <P> When the Supreme Court handed down its abortion opinion last summer in Webster  vs. Reproductive Health Services, it was greeted by the expected hue and cry.  If anyone still doubts the political significance of the case, he or she need  look no further than the political turmoil now brewing in their respective  state capitals.  </P> <P> Domestic politics has been radically altered by the Webster case for the  foreseeable future. The states are rediscovering the gravity of their original  role as centers of moral judgment. And that is the real virtue of the Webster  decision.  </P> <P> The Florida Legislature has just battled through a special session to consider  abortion legislation strongly backed by Gov. Bob Martinez. That the Republican  governor lost to the Democrats in the Sunshine State has been made into more  than it is. Other states are confronting the same issue, and every indication  is that Florida will not be the general rule. Pennsylvania, for example, is  about to consider a package of the most restrictive abortion laws yet -- and  the Democratic governor there, Robert Casey, has vowed to sign that legislation  into law as soon as it hits his desk. To make the politics of abortion even  more interesting, Casey is being opposed in the gubernatorial race by a  Republican running hard on the pro-choice side of the debate.  </P> <P> For 16 years, those who agreed with the court's landmark Roe vs. Wade ruling  have been more than happy to avoid the legislative fracas that they now must  face. In Roe, the justices constitutionalized abortion. In Webster, the court  stopped far short of overruling Roe but was willing nonetheless to enlarge the  states' prerogatives in dealing with the tumultuous issue.  </P> <P> The fact is, as the experience in Florida shows, the question of abortion finds  good and decent people on both sides of the issue. There is no clean and simple  line dividing pro-life from pro-choice; neither race, religion, gender nor age  explains a person's stand on abortion. The reason is simple. At its deepest  level, the question of abortion is a political question of the first order --  that is to say, it is a moral issue.  </P> <P> Such moral questions can be resolved only by political argument, that laborious  process of weighing the pros and the cons, the pluses and the minuses of this  policy or that. While one might believe deeply that abortion is basically  wrong, that judgment might have to be tempered, if not mitigated, by facts.  Incest, rape, the life of the mother all must be weighed politically against  any absolute claim that abortion is simply wrong. The legislatures of the  states are quite capable of addressing the question and reaching some practical  compromise between the competing moral claims engendered by abortion. Public  policy governing abortion will be all the better for it. But there is an even  better reason for shifting the political responsibility for abortion back to  the states. That reason is federalism.  </P> <P> To many, the states seem little more than a political inconvenience or a  constitutional artifact. The fact is, they are essential parts of the  Constitution's original concern for encouraging decent self-government. By  providing a forum for the airing of fundamental controversies, the states serve  to draw the citizenry more immediately into the conduct of public affairs. When  the justices of the Supreme Court fenced the people out of the abortion  question, they did more than merely skew the federal balance between the  national government and the states; they undermined popular government.  </P> <P> By forcing the people to confront such issues as abortion directly within their  states, federalism can inculcate a healthy regard for the political process.  Laws hammered out in a process open to all sides will enjoy a greater support  among the people, none of whom will simply have their own way, but all will  have a chance to be heard, to make their case, to persuade.  </P> <P> As the other statehouses batten down their hatches preparing for a storm, they  should reflect on how politically uplifting their role can be. From the  deliberations they will be forced to engage in, state legislators and governors  will inevitably serve to flesh out the moral dimension of this troubling issue  of abortion. From the heat likely to be generated within the states can also  come a good bit of light. While the politics will not be easy, the results will  at least be democratically legitimate.  </P></p>

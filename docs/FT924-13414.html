			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Consortium faces uphill fight over offer for ITN THE CONSORTIUM making an offer for Independent Television News faced an uphill struggle last night as ITV companies controlling a majority of shares expressed scepticism about the deal. Four companies, two of them ITN shareholders, have offered to buy the 400,000 Pounds 1 shares for Pounds 1 each and put up Pounds 30m in new money to end financial uncertainty at the award-winning television news organisation. ITN faces a Pounds 25m deficit on the lease of its London headquarters in Gray's Inn Road over the next five years. The four, which would hold at least 80 per cent of ITN, are Carlton Communications, which takes over the London weekday franchise from Thames at the beginning of next year, Central Independent Television, London Weekend Television and Reuters, the news and information group. Yorkshire Television, which controls 14 per cent of the ITN shares, is openly sceptical. Mr Clive Leach, chief executive of Yorkshire, said yesterday: 'The offer grossly undervalues the company. ITN has a strong balance sheet.' Granada Television, which owns 12.8 per cent of the shares, is also doubtful. The deal is dependent on a five-year ITN news supply deal averaging Pounds 53m a year, something Granada might accept if it was a significant ITN shareholder. It would be less interested in paying such a sum if its stake were heavily diluted. Thames, with 22.2 per cent of the shares, is also sceptical. A 75 per cent majority is needed to change ITN articles of association. At the moment, only ITV companies can be shareholders. In addition to Central and LWT, which together have nearly 20 per cent of the shares, companies likely to support the deal in principle include Anglia, with 4.6 per cent, and TV South, with 8 per cent. There was a growing belief in ITV last night that the offer would at least be a catalyst to break the logjam blocking decision-making at ITN. The big problem has been who should fund the property deficit. One possibility is that at least the outline of an alternative grouping could be put together before Monday's ITN board meeting. This might include one of the three US broadcasting groups, ABC, CBS and CNN, which have expressed an interest in taking a stake in ITN. Such a move has been considered because the 1990 Broadcasting Act requires a majority of the shares in ITN to be held by non-ITV broadcasters by 1994, although some ITV companies want the government to change its mind on that condition.

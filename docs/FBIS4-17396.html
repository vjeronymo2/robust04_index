			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent] </F>   [Text] Ashkhabad [Ashgabat], 22 Apr -- Turkmen President  Saparmurad Niyazov and Li Peng, premier of the State Council of  the People's Republic of China (PRC), have agreed to expand  bilateral, political, economic, and cultural links.    After completing his three-day visit to Turkmenistan, the  Chinese governmental head left for Bishkek where he will have  talks with Kyrgyz President Askar Akayev on Saturday [23 April].    Although during the visit no agreement was concluded on the  "project of the century" -- the installation with Chinese  participation of a super gas pipe to connect wells in the  Karakum deserts to gas rings on the islands of Japan -- the  parties agreed to "continue to study seriously" the project. A  protocol on intentions was signed between Turkmenistan's  Ministry of Oil and Gas and the Chinese national oil corporation  that envisages the creation of a Sino-Turkmen-Japanese  commission of experts.    In the opinion of experts, Turkmenistan may boost its yearly  gas extraction to 230 billion cubic meters in the next 15 years.    A press communique on the visit's results distributed by the  Chinese delegation notes both countries' intention to build  long- term, stable relations on the basis of principles of world  coexistence emphasized at the talks. The Chinese Government  voiced support for Turkmenistan's efforts to defend state  independence and sovereignty and to stabilize the situation in  the country and region. Direct links between the partners in  the trading and economic sphere would be encouraged. There was  a "positive attitude" to opening direct air links between China  and Turkmenistan.    An agreement on granting Turkmenistan a Chinese loan and a  protocol on regular consultations between the two countries'  foreign ministries were signed in the presidential palace today.  The Chinese Government will also grant material and technical  assistance free of charge. Both the contents of the latter and  the value of the loan are unknown.    Li Peng, who has already been to Uzbekistan, will also visit  Kazakhstan and Mongolia in the course of his present 12-day  trip.</p>

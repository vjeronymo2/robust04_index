			<p><P> May 26, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: FILLMORE;  </P> <P> RESIDENTS OPPOSE WATER TANK PLANS  </P> <P> A report declaring that a proposed 3-million-gallon water storage tank in  Fillmore would have no significant impact on the environment is being  vigorously contested by neighboring residents.  </P> <P> The City Council listened to testimony earlier this week from about a dozen  residents who live on Foothill Drive and oppose installation of the tank  because they said it would be unsightly and vulnerable to earthquakes.  </P> <P> The current proposal calls for all trees and shrubs to be removed from the site  and new vegetation to be planted after the tank is constructed.  </P> <P> After listening to the complaints, the council asked the landscaping firm and  project engineers to present alternative plans designed to preserve as many of  the existing trees as possible.  </P> <P> The council will listen to additional public testimony June 12.  </P> <P> In the past year, Fillmore planners have examined eight sites for the tank,  which officials say is necessary to meet peak demands of up to 4 million  gallons per day. The storage capacity of two existing reservoir tanks is 2 1/2  million gallons, which exceeds the current average daily consumption but cannot  meet heavy demands, such as those caused by a major fire.  </P> <P> William Winterstein, a Foothill Drive resident, presented a petition signed by  61 residents who oppose the proposed tank because they say a nearby existing  tank is an environmental eyesore.  </P> <P> Under a proposal by a landscape architect, oaks, pines and peppertrees planted  40 years ago would be destroyed.  </P> <P> Janet Fremlin Cox, whose family owns the site, told the council, "The owners  aren't happy about the city's plans for a 'tank farm' on Foothill. Since the  city plans to take the property by eminent domain, the least you could do is  save those trees." JANET BERGAMO  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Asylbek Abeldinov: "Amendments to the Law on </F> Public Associations Are Required"]    [Text] More than 400 registered public associations  operate in Kazakhstan. The majority of them have emerged in  recent years. "Practice" requires the improvement of "theory":  Lacunae in the legal base for the activity of parties,  movements, associations, and such are obvious today. This is the  subject of an article by Asylbek Abeldinov, member of the  Central Election Commission of Kazakhstan and candidate of legal  sciences.    A most important sphere of public relations connected with  realization of the right of the citizens to association is  regulated by the Law "On Public Associations in the Kazakh SSR,"  which was adopted on 27 June 1991.    But very appreciable changes have occurred in the recent  period. A new statehood is taking shape, and the Constitution of  the Republic of Kazakhstan has been adopted, which, in turn,  requires current legislation to be brought into line with the  provisions of the constitution and the development and detailing  of constitutional provisions with regard to the requirements of  current social practice.    A public-law mechanism of the realization of constitutional  formulas should be created in order that on the one hand it  really secure the rights and liberties of the citizen and, on  the other, that the rights and liberties be realized inseparably  from the obligations of the citizen, whose discharge is  essential for the assurance of personal, public, and state  interests.    In the context of what has been set forth there should, it  would seem, be work done on the preparation of revisions and  addenda to the legislation regulating the activity of public  associations. It should be specified here that we are not  talking only about the specific above-mentioned law. The  problem, I believe, encompasses quite a wide range of  legislative instruments. We have to raise the question of  civil and economic and administrative and criminal legislation  also.    A public association is an association of specific  individuals which has arisen as the result of the  voluntary, free, and conscious expression of the wishes of the  citizens and which operates on the basis of the  equality of its members, self-administration, legality,  and glasnost. It should be added to this that an  association is created on the basis of a community of  interests of different individuals for the realization of their  rights and liberties. The legal capacity of the public  association as a legal entity arises only after the  registration of its charter by an authorized official body  in the procedure determined by legislation.    In other words, a salient feature of the institution in  question is that it is uniquely "impregnated" with the ideas of  legality, is based on the rights of man and citizen, and should  constantly ensure observance of the obligations of both the  public association and its members. None of these components  should either fall by the wayside or be broken in the overall  "chain" of activity of both the public association and each of  its members in the composition of the latter.    But let us ponder: Are all these and other aspects connected  with the functioning of the public associations regulated  legislatively this scrupulously and in such broad envelopment.  Perhaps not. Nor is this easy.    Account should be taken of the following aspects.    If a public association is a voluntary formation that has  arisen as the result of the free expression of the wishes of the  citizens united on the basis of a community of interests, then,  logically, the citizens that are members of it delegate to  the public association the right to control their behavior and  actions in the name of the achievement of common goals and  interests. Consequently, the purpose of the public  association in this case is to ensure the formulation and  determination of collective thought and collective actions  within the framework of legality.    It is this "status" that should be stimulated by the  official  structures. I consider essential in this connection the  development in current legislation of the provision enshrined in  Article 53 of the constitution, according to which "the state  ensures observance of the rights and legitimate interests of  public associations."    But, as a study of the opinion of members of public  associations shows, they do not always have a clear idea of what  rights are accorded the public associations.    According to Article 18 (it is called "Rights of public  associations") of the law on public associations, their rights  are enshrined in their charters. At the same time, on the other  hand, this cannot be understood in the literal meaning of the  word. In other words, the charters should enshrine only rights  clearly defined by the legislator. Which precisely? In  accordance with the said article of the law (I quote verbatim):  "For realization of the purposes and tasks determined in the  charters, program documents, and other acts the public  associations shall freely disseminate information concerning  their purposes and activity and, in the instances and in the  procedure specified by legislation, enjoy also the following  rights:    "exercise legislative initiative in the person of their  republic authorities (this right has become invalid inasmuch as  it was not enshrined in the new constitution);    "represent and defend the legitimate interests of their  members (participants) in state and public bodies;    "exercise other authority not conflicting with current  legislation."    But other articles of the said law contain different rights  also. Thus Article 19 specifies the right of public associations  to create in the procedure established by law for the purpose of  achievement of the statutory tasks enterprises and financially  autonomous organizations possessing the rights of legal entity.  Article 20 lists in detail what the public associations may own.  Article 21 enshrines their right to establish press organs and  engage in publishing activity in accordance with legislation of  the republic. Article 26 establishes the right of public  associations to maintain international relations.    The law lacks a precise definition of the obligations  of public associations. I believe it would be expedient in  the interests of the unambiguous understanding and application  of the enshrined provisions to unite all that has been  enumerated above, say, within the framework of one article  entitled "Rights and obligations of public associations."    Certain provisions of Article 11 of the law on public  associations (it is called "Membership of (participation in)  public associations") require the corresponding amplification or  adjustment. Specifically, the provision of this article to the  effect that collective members (the work force of  enterprises, institutions, and organizations and citizens'  associations) may, in addition to political parties and trade  unions, take part in the activity of public associations would  seem contentious, in my view.    This provision is contrary, in my opinion, to the very  essence of the public association inasmuch as it is created on  the basis of the conscious expression of the wishes of specific  individuals personally undertaking to comply with the  requirements of the charter. The principle of the equality of  the members of the association is violated also (what kind of  equality can there be, you will agree, between the individual  and the collective member). I cannot imagine what kind of  "general" community of interests as a whole of the work force of  this enterprise or institution or the other there could be.  Especially if these are not political purposes and not  professional interests (as we have already said, political  parties and trade unions cannot by law have collective members).    One public association's collective membership of another  gives rise to questions also. In this case, logically, the  members and organs of administration of the first association  should be guided in their activity by both their own charter and  the charter of the association they have joined as a collective  member. It transpires here that for some individual members  there will be "dual" requirements, rights and obligations, and  so forth, so to speak, for others, not. There is formally once  again a violation of the principle of the equality of individual  members. In addition, the constitutional principle of the  equality of the legal possibilities of public associations is  violated also.    But, as an analysis shows, there are many examples of public  associations which have, indeed, registered in the procedure  established by law uniting on a voluntary basis in unions of  public associations. This is characteristic particularly of  cultural and educational and artistic public associations.    This right of the public associations is specified by  Article  9 of the law.    But clarification is required here, in my view. Inasmuch as  the citizens' associations creating the union have their own  registered charters, they should unite in a union as subjects of  the latter. In other words, a union (new formation) should not  interfere in the intra-statutory activity of its subjects,  should not decide questions of membership in them, and so forth  inasmuch as it is not individual members of different public  associations that are uniting in a new one but associations of  citizens as a whole that are uniting for the joint achievement  of the common purposes of different associations.    A union of associations does not have individual members  directly: each association independently determines the  procedure and conditions of membership in it and the rights and  obligations of its members, that is, its "internal life." These  clarifications should be made to the current law.    It has to be acknowledged that our legislation absolutely  does not regulate the procedure or conditions of the formation  and functioning on the territory of the republic of structural  subdivisions of international public (nongovernment)  associations and the public associations of other states. I  would like to share my thoughts in this connection.    First. The head associations should be registered  according to the whereabouts of their headquarters and,  consequently, present to the authorized official body of  Kazakhstan a copy of evidence (certificate) of registration of  the charter (regulations) and the actual charter of this  association certified in the established procedure.    Second. The purposes and tasks of the activity of  this association must not conflict with the constitution or  legislation of our state.    Third. An undertaking by the head of the  diplomatic representation of the specific state to the effect  that the activity of the structural subdivision of a public  associations of this state will not be exercised to the  detriment of the interests of the Republic of Kazakhstan is  essential.    Fourth. A structural subdivision of such  associations should have its own charter adopted and registered  in our state in accordance with the legislation of the latter.    Fifth. Supervision of the activity of the  structural subdivisions of such public associations should be  exercised in accordance with the legislation of the Republic of  Kazakhstan.    But the main condition I consider the following: The  sponsors  of the formation and leaders of the organs of administration of  such structural subdivisions should be only citizens of the  Republic of Kazakhstan, the right of citizens of other states to  participate in the work of such organizations not being excluded  here.    And how to determine the status of a public association:  Will  it be an international, republic, regional, or local association?    Things are today reaching the point of absurdity. If the  sponsors of the creation of a public association want to  register its charter with a declaration of its republic status,  the statutory activity of the citizens' association must, as  Article 7 of the law declares, extend even prior to registration  of its charter to the territory of all or a majority of  oblasts of the republic.    And according to Article 13, what is more, it is necessary  within one month from the day that the charter is adopted (and  the association is formed, consequently) to have submitted a  declaration to the appropriate authorized official body with the  enclosure of material confirming the territory of dissemination  of the activity of the association and other material necessary  for registration of the charter.    This "severity" of legislative prescription hardly  corresponds to the interests of the cause or a strengthening of  legality in the activity of the public associations.    Which is what I would like to propose.    The authorized official body registering the charter of a  public association should, evidently, determine the specific  timeframe within which the association, after registration  of its charter, is required to present to this body documents on  the creation of its structural subdivisions on the  territory of the corresponding oblasts and their registration in  the procedure established by law. In the event of noncompliance  with this condition, the same official body should cancel its  decision on registration of the charter.    The soundness of the current practice, when one and the same  body, the Ministry of Justice, for example, undertakes the  preliminary consultation on questions of the formation of public  associations and itself performs the registration, would seem  contentious, in my view. It would be more expedient for these to  be different bodies. Some should hold the consultations, say,  others, undertake the official registration of the charters of  public associations. A practice has taken shape currently  whereby the same specialists render advisory assistance and  present the findings in respect to the documents for  registration of the charters prepared on the basis of their  advice.    It would be expedient for the activity of political parties  to be regulated by a special law. The point being that the  current law on public associations determines merely the  procedure and conditions of formation and also membership of  political parties. I believe that this is insufficient inasmuch  as the law should not only prohibit or authorize but regulate  specific activity and adjust particular legal relationships.    I would believe expedient in this connection the adoption of  a public associations code with the inclusion in it of the laws  on public associations, on freedom of religion and religious  associations, and on the trade unions, which have already been  adopted and which are operating, and also the proposed new law  on political parties.</p>

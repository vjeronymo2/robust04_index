			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Benjamin Yeh] </F>   [Text] Taipei, April 19 (CNA) -- Justice Minister Ma  Ying-jeou said Tuesday [19 April] that the Republic of China  [ROC] has not exploited prison laborers for economic gain, in  accordance with a United Nations' Convention on Human Rights.    Ma, in response to an inquiry by Kuomintang Legislator Cheng  Chien-jen, stressed that the export of toys manufactured by a  Taichung Prison to the United States has also not violated  either ROC or United States law.    The associated press reported in a dispatch from Colorado on  Monday that a 10-year-old boy found a note from a toy glider he  bought. The note read, in broken English: "Hey lucky friends.  This toys make in prison Taiwan ROC." The writer asked the  recipient of her note to "investigate Taiwan ROC disobey  international human right law."    Ma noted that the present law requires inmates to learn  skills in prisons. "The process is legal," Ma said.    He emphasized that none of the inmates in Taiwan's prisons  have been exploited, and that the firms contracting with the  prisons here have not subsequently gained an unfair competitive  edge.    Ma said the government will give an accounting of its  prison-labor practices to the United States. He tried to play  down the significance of the incident, saying it has drawn wide  attention only because of its dramatic nature.    Officials at Taichung Prison identified the writer of the  note as Liu Hsing-ping, 40, who began serving his nearly 13-year  sentence for theft and rape in January 1991.    The prison has 45 workshops where inmates are employed by 35  manufacturers engaging in toy-making, printing, sewing and other  lines of work.    According to ROC law, the inmates are paid to work six to  eight hours a day, with 40 percent of the pay going into their  pockets and the remaining 60 percent used for upgrading prison  facilities.</p>

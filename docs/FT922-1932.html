			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Commodity price revival forecast PRICES FOR most commodities could show a strong revival in 1993 if the economies of the leading industrialised countries recover enough to stimulate demand for raw materials, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit, writes Our Commodities Staff. 'We expect the global economy to pick up in 1992 and most commodities are sensitive to change on the demand side,' said Mr Alec Gordon, editor of the unit's World Commodity Forecasts. In the latest edition, of the 26 commodities prices covered by the EIU, 18 are seen as fetching higher prices in 1993 than this year, when many commodity prices hit new lows because of the recession. In the soft commodities, crops may be badly hit by drought and the ensuing supply problems should support prices, Mr Gordon said. He expected tea, sunflower and soyabean oils prices to do better in 1993 than this year. The coffee and cocoa markets are still heavily oversupplied but if stock control measures succeed, prices could recover strongly, Mr Gordon said. Nickel, with its fortunes strongly linked to stainless steel production, would benefit from a strengthening consumer goods sector, while use of copper strongly depended on an upturn in the construction and power transmission sectors, the EIU said.  -------------------------------------------------                   PRICE FORECASTS  -------------------------------------------------                          1992    1993    change %  ------------------------------------------------- Cocoa (c/lb)               51      60       +17.7 Tea (p/kg)                115     128       +11.3 Sugar (c/lb)             9.03       9        -0.3 Wheat (Dollars/t)         152     145        -4.6 Soyaoil (Dollars/t)       438     483       +10.3 Copper (c/lb)            99.5     110       +10.6 Tin (Dollars/lb)         2.84    3.39       +19.4 Zinc (c/lb)              57.5    64.3       +11.8  ------------------------------------------------- Source: EIU  -------------------------------------------------</p>

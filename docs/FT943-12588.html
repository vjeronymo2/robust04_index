			<p>940723 FT  23 JUL 94 / Property: Results reflect London's strength - Cadogan's Place Results from Savills and John D. Wood, for the year ended April 30, reflect the strength of the London property market. Savills' pre-tax profits increased 125 per cent, from Pounds 1.44m to Pounds 3.24m, with the agricultural and residential side contributing Pounds 1.19m (Pounds 458,000) thanks to firmer London and farmland markets. Foreigners made up more than 40 per cent of the buyers in London. Wood reports pre-tax profits of Pounds 681,000, against a Pounds 291,000 loss the year before. London turnover was more than 50 per cent higher, and near the peak of 1987-88, while country and agricultural turnover rose 24 per cent. The price inflation rate in central London has been around 20 per cent in the past 18 months. A report from Cluttons reveals an average central London price rise of 10.3 per cent in the year to June 1994, with roughly a fifth of that coming in the second quarter of this year. Houses increased more than flats. Fulham and Pimlico have risen more - proportionately speaking - than Knightsbridge and Kensington; indeed, the short supply of houses in Fulham led to an average annual increase of 16.3 per cent, which is almost twice as much as for flats (8.2). Handsome price, handsome flat . . . agent de Groot Collis (071-235 8090) is seeking offers of more than Pounds 2m for the 28-year lease of a ground-floor Knightsbridge apartment in Cadogan Square, SW1. Besides use of the garden in the square, it opens on to a shared garden at the back of the terrace. But its treat is spectacular joinery: French oak floors and deep mahogany in one bathroom. The other has burr maple, even on the lavatory seat and the ceiling. A huge mirror emphasises the beautiful grain of the wood - and the sense of being in your own early-18th century cabinet. The major part of a Gloucestershire village manor house with three acres of grounds and gardens is being offered for sale, freehold, by Butler Sherborn of Burford, Oxfordshire. (Tel: 0993-822325). It is looking for offers of Pounds 395,000 for the seven-bedroom property on the edge of Kencot, a Cotswold stone village, 14 miles from Swindon and 22 miles from Oxford. The house, listed grade II, is believed to date to the early 17th century. Lovers of Victorian architecture are offered a rare opportunity at Ramsgate, Kent. The Grange, built by architect and writer AW Pugin early in the 1840s, is for sale, coinciding with an exhibition about him at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. This house was a revolt against the classical/Georgian tradition in domestic architecture, and affected design for decades. In brick and stone, it has three floors and an imposing tower with views over Ramsgate harbour to the Channel. The stained glass in the chapel includes saints Augustine and Gregory, plus Pugin and his wife and family. The price is Pounds 300,000 from Knight Frank &amp; Rutley in Tunbridge Wells (0892-515 035). At South Holmwood near Dorking, Surrey, a house designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens in the Dutch style is on offer for Pounds 400,000 from John D. Wood (071-493 4106). Called The Dutch House, it has an unusual Y-plan.</p>

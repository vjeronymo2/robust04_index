[Begin Rivero recording] My first impression is one of  surprise, because we are a neighboring country. Venezuela is a  country that shares common interests with Colombia, a good many  Colombians live peacefully in Venezuela and many Venezuelans  live in Colombia under conditions of stability and respect. I  do not have the slightest idea why the terrorists chose to bomb  this consulate. [end recording]    Rivero said the terrorist attacks may be an effort to create  chaos in the city and to hinder investigations.    The Venezuelan consulate in Medellin must be transferred to  another site due to the magnitude of the damage caused by the  bomb explosion at 0548 this morning.</p>

			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / Lloyd's denies bankruptcy claims REPORTS THAT Conservative MPs may be forced into bankruptcy by their losses at Lloyd's were yesterday described as 'completely misleading' by Lloyd's and dismissed by some of the politicians involved. Lady Archer, who chairs the insurance market's hardship committee which provides financial help to hard-hit Names, said: 'Lloyd's does not pursue members into bankruptcy provided they admit their liability and agree to pay what part of their loss they can afford.' Lloyd's accepted that Names - the individuals whose assets support the insurance market  - could become bankrupt as a result of losses from other business ventures. Mr Jerry Wiggin, MP for Weston-super-Mare and a Lloyd's Name since 1962, said: 'The sort of assumption that people are going to be bankrupted and lose their seats is ludicrous at this stage.' It was 'both premature and ill-advised,' he added. Sir Richard Body, a long-standing Tory MP and Name, said some Conservative MPs who had lost money at Lloyd's, the London-based insurance market, could decide to leave the Commons in order to pursue more lucrative careers outside politics, but he did not think that the plight of any MP would get as far as bankruptcy. The terms of hardship arrangements, which remain in force for three years, vary according to individual circumstances. Typically Names are allowed to retain an income of between Pounds 10,000 and Pounds 15,000 a year. Lloyd's takes a charge over any property but the Name is allowed to continue living in a 'modest' home - which in London could be worth up to about Pounds 150,000. An MP loses his seat only if a court judges him bankrupt and that adjudication is not annulled after six months. The Times yesterday reported that 47 Conservative MPs were Names in 1990, the market's latest year of account, for which Lloyd's expects to post record losses of between Pounds 2.5bn and Pounds 2.8bn in June. Average losses for each of the 28,770 Names trading in 1990 are likely to exceed Pounds 100,000 each. The Lloyd's 'Blue Book', which contains details of Names' syndicate participations, shows that only a handful of the MPs were members of the hardest-hit syndicates. Mr Paul Marland, MP for Gloucestershire West, whose Lloyd's losses have been well publicised, is a member of the disastrous Gooda Walker syndicates 290, 298 and 299, which have specialised in catastrophe reinsurance and have suffered some of the heaviest losses at Lloyd's. His majority is 4,958. Mr David Tredinnick (Bosworth) is a member of two loss-making Feltrim syndicates which also specialised in the same business. His majority is 19,094. With Mr Marland and Mr Tredinnick, Mr Ian Lang, MP for Galloway &amp; Upper Nithsdale, the Scottish secretary, is a member of Rose Thomson Young syndicate 255. His majority is 2,468. Several Conservative MPs are set to make smaller than average losses, however. The Lloyd's affairs of seven MPs are handled by the Roberts &amp; Hiscox agency which is forecasting average losses for its Names of only 7 per cent of capacity (the amount of premiums a Name can accept), far below the market average. Both Lloyd's and Tory MPs made clear that there was no question of any preferential treatment for MPs facing losses. Mr Ian Taylor, Tory MP for Esher, who two years ago urged the government to act to help Lloyd's Names by enabling them to throw back losses against profits in previous years, said yesterday he was disappointed ministers had not accepted his proposals. The government made it clear yesterday that even though the existing Finance Bill, which is the subject of detailed discussion by MPs, contains the Lloyd's provision announced in the Budget allowing Lloyd's Names to set aside tax-free reserves against losses incurred on future trading, ministers do not intend to amend the legislation to provide help for Names in difficulties.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Tova Tzimuqi] </F>   [Text] Israel wants to retain legal and judicial  responsibility for the handling of serious crimes perpetrated by  Palestinians in the autonomous areas in Gaza and Jericho, even  after the agreement of principles is implemented.    This proposal is contained in a draft document dealing with  the implementation of the legal aspects of the autonomy  agreement submitted to the PLO for perusal .    According to the proposal, crimes committed by Palestinians  against Israelis and resulting in death or serious injury, as  well as rape and kidnapping, would be immediately transferred  from the Palestinian police to the Israeli law enforcement  authorities.    The document relayed to the PLO was drafted by a team of  police officers and legal experts in the Foreign, Defense, and  Justice Ministries and the IDF [Israel Defense Forces]. The  document stipulates that Israelis in the autonomous areas would  enjoy quasi-diplomatic status. They would enjoy immunity from  the Palestinian police and could be arrested, interrogated, and  tried only by Israeli elements.    Israel proposes full reciprocity in law enforcement only  with  regard to minor crimes committed by Palestinians or Israelis  within the autonomous areas. Minor crimes committed by  Palestinians against Israelis would be handled by the  Palestinian law enforcement authorities. They would conduct the  investigation, arrest, trial, and punishment and would then  report the measures taken to the Israeli law authorities. If  they fail to do so, Israel would be entitled to deal with these  crimes as it sees fit.    The document contains a detailed proposal on law enforcement  and policing in the autonomous areas. Joint patrols by Israel  Police and the Palestinian police force would drive in two cars  on all the roads where there is intensive Israeli traffic (such  as the Erez-Rafah road). There would be two kinds of patrols:  one kind would drive back and forth, while the other would be  stationary. The latter would be deployed at major junctions,  and would be summoned as warranted by reports about incidents.    The Israeli and Palestinian police vehicles would be linked  by radio to a joint situation room. Three situation rooms would  be established: one in Jericho and two in the Gaza Strip, one  in the north and another in the south. The situation rooms  would be overseen by a liaison committee.    Joint patrols accompanied by patrols of the Israeli security  forces would drive on lateral roads linking the Gaza Strip and  Israel.    The draft agreement submitted to the PLO further states that  the implementation of the autonomy in Gaza and Jericho would not  annul existing entitlements or private deals between Israelis  and Palestinians. The law of continuity would apply to  obligations, rights, and damage suits. It should be pointed out  that upon mutual consent any security and legal arrangements to  be decided would be subject to revision in the following five  years.</p>

			<p><P> May 2, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: FILLMORE;  </P> <P> COUNCIL SEEKS TO MOVE UP TAX VOTE  </P> <P> Fillmore city officials said Tuesday that they want to move up the date of a  special election to raise new property taxes that would finance a proposed  industrial park.  </P> <P> Last week, the Fillmore City Council decided to propose the new taxing  authority to Fillmore landowners in a special mail-in ballot July 26.  </P> <P> But if 13 voting landowners agree, their votes could be cast in an earlier  election.  </P> <P> "We want them to make a decision and get the vote over with," said Councilman  Roger Campbell. He said it was likely that the votes would be cast before July.  </P> <P> Under the city's proposed special tax district, Fillmore would levy new  property taxes to pay off $5 million in bonds that are financing the  development of an industrial park. Each landowner in the 128-acre area would be  assessed new taxes to pay for sewer pipes, water lines and storm drains needed  to develop the park.  </P> <P> Fillmore officials want the industrial park to lure business to the small town,  which relies nearly exclusively on the agricultural industry for jobs.  </P> <P> To approve the special tax authority, two-thirds of the landowners would have  to approve the tax district.

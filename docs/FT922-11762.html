			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / International Company News: Transamerica profits soar SHARES IN Transamerica, the San Francisco-based financial services group, bounced Dollars 3 higher to Dollars 46 1/2 at close of trade yesterday, following news of sharply higher first-quarter profits. The company reported earnings of Dollars 83.6m after tax, as against Dollars 57.2m (before an item to cover accounting changes) last year, with earnings per share up from 70 cents to Dollars 1.04. Transamerica's insurance operations turned in Dollars 55.8m, compared with Dollars 77.6m in the same period last year. This was primarily due to the US company's reduced stake in Sedgwick, the UK-based insurance broker which now stands at 25 per cent, compared with 39 per cent a year earlier. The life business reported earnings of Dollars 43.7m, up from Dollars 39.1m in the first quarter of 1991. On the finance side the commercial lending division moved into the black - reporting a Dollars 3.1m profit, compared with a Dollars 24.4m loss last time. Consumer lending went ahead to Dollars 24.6m, against Dollars 22.9m the year before.</p>

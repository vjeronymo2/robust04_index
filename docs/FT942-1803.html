			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / International Company News: Wine producer acquires brands Mildura Blass, one of the growing number of quoted wine producers in Australia, is acquiring the Black Opal and related wine brands from Mr Mark Cashmore. The Adelaide-based company has made and marketed the brands since 1990, under a five-year licensing agreement, and they now account for 13 per cent of Mildura's total sales volume. The wines have sold particularly strongly in the US, allowing Mildura to corner a one-fifth market share of total Australian wine sales there. Mildura is Australia's fourth largest wine producer.</p>

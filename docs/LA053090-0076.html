			<p><P> May 30, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CITY SECTION 4-A DIVISION BASEBALL CHAMIONSHIP;  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETE OF THE WEEK;  </P> <P> TREEND GAINS CONTROL OF HIS FASTBALL, FOES  </P> <P> Pat Treend prefers heavy-metal music. Treend prefers metal bats. Treend's  targets prefer armor.  </P> <P> Well, targets might be a slight exaggeration, but anyone who has been plunked  by one of the El Camino Real High pitcher's bone-busting fastballs might feel  otherwise.  </P> <P> When Treend was a kid, his size, not to mention his wayward fastball, was cause  for concern. At age 13, Treend was already 6 feet tall. Many a mother fretted  that Treend would send her child home from the game with a Mr. Spalding spot  welded to his left temple.  </P> <P> "Moms would walk up to Pat and say, 'Oh, please don't hit little Johnny today,'  " said Chuck Treend, Pat's father. "Others would say, 'Hey, check the birth  certificate of that big oaf.' "  </P> <P> Treend's wildness is well-documented. From his first day of ball at El Camino  Real, it was obvious that if Treend wasn't raising eyebrows, he was parting  them.  </P> <P> "For a long time, I think they were afraid to let Pat pitch B. P. because they  thought he'd kill somebody," said Jason Cohen, an El Camino Real outfielder.  </P> <P> "I think it might have something to do with the first guy I pitched to at my  first varsity tryout," said Treend, who has signed to play next season for UC  Santa Barbara.  </P> <P> As a wild-eyed, wild-winged freshman, Treend took the mound to face Leo Matsuda  as dozens of players looked on. Offering No. 1 was a strike, Treend recalls.  Offering No. 2 was a ball, Treend recalls. Offering No. 3 hit Matsuda in the  face. Treend recoils.  </P> <P> "I got him right in the jaw," Treend said. "He hit the ground like a sack of  potatoes, he was out cold. . . . All the older guys were going, 'God, he isn't  moving. He's dead.'  </P> <P> "I was scared to death. I mean, I was a big kid, but mentally, I'm 15 years  old. So the next guy climbs in and he's quaking in his boots. I'm so scared I  start throwing 'em in there at about 25 or 30 miles an hour.  </P> <P> "I think that's when (Coach Mike) Maio decided I wasn't quite ready (for the  varsity)."  </P> <P> Matsuda recovered. So did Treend, sort of. In his first junior varsity start,  which ended in a 1-1 tie, Treend struck out 15 in seven innings -- and walked  11.  </P> <P> He made the varsity as a sophomore and showed promise, although wildness  stalked him until the middle of last summer. As a junior, Treend walked 35 in  49 1/3 innings and finished 4-3. His earned-run average of 5.96 was high enough  to melt a solar-powered calculator.  </P> <P> He seemed to snap out of the walk-one-whiff-one funk while helping pitch  Woodland Hills West to an American Legion World Series title last August.  Coincidentally or not, Treend has dropped 25 pounds from his 6-foot-4 frame  since last summer and is down to 195.  </P> <P> But Treend says the idea that it might be healthier to throw strikes crossed  his mind well before Legion play started.  </P> <P> "I think I got the idea after a few seams got scraped across my forehead last  year by Chatsworth and Kennedy guys," he said. "I got mashed last year."  </P> <P> Treend always has had rifle-arm velocity -- his fastball has been clocked in  the mid-80s -- but his spray pattern was more akin to a shotgun blast. As a  senior, however, his wildness has essentially been muzzled.  </P> <P> Treend (12-0) has struck out 100 in 84 2/3 innings with 47 walks. He has  allowed 61 hits, has an earned-run average of 1.24 and has completed 11 of 12  starts.  </P> <P> More important, he no longer has had to endure teammates' plaintive pleas to  just throw strikes.  </P> <P> "Position players think it's that easy -- just walk up there and throw 'em over  the plate," Treend said with a sniff. "Heck, if they come within a few feet of  a guy on a cutoff play, that's pretty good. In pitching, it all comes down to  about two inches."  </P> <P> His talent, it seems, now matches his proportions. In a City Section 4-A  Division semifinal game against San Fernando on Friday, Treend threw a  one-hitter, struck out 11 and walked five to lead El Camino Real to a 3-1  victory and a date with Chatsworth in the championship game tonight at Dodger  Stadium.  </P> <P> "I don't think I've ever seen Pat throw better than that," Maio said. "He had  such a rhythm, he was in such a groove."  </P> <P> But it has been a learning experience.  </P> <P> "(When) I came into high school, I was basically a thrower," Treend said. Maio  points to Treend's improvement in "maturity and concentration."  </P> <P> Either way, his teammates are thankful. Cohen and Treend were teammates as  14-year-olds, and Cohen was the catcher.  </P> <P> "Sometimes he'd throw about five balls in a row right off the plate," Cohen  said. "Imagine what my body looked like after the game."  </P> <P> Cohen said he once was crossed up and tried to barehand a Treend heave that  caromed off the plate.  </P> <P> "Dislocated three of my fingers," Cohen said. "I swear, they were purple and  blue within 30 seconds."  </P> <P> There were times when Treend also took his lumps.  </P> <P> When Treend was 9, his father coached a team of all-stars from the West Hills  Mustang program. The team included Ryan McGuire, now a senior at El Camino  Real, and 1989 graduate Paul Geller.  </P> <P> Pat didn't make the squad -- he wasn't good enough.  </P> <P> "It was hard to do, but I didn't want anybody saying he was on the team just  because he was my kid," Chuck Treend said. "At that age, he just hadn't grown  into his body yet.  </P> <P> "He sure didn't start out as an all-star, but he's always had an incredible  desire to be a ballplayer."  </P> <P> Is he a late bloomer and a late boomer? Treend has amazed many with the bat  this season -- his coach included -- rolling up a .371 average and driving in a  team-high 27 runs. But some aren't as wide-eyed.  </P> <P> As a 13-year-old, Treend broke an ankle while backpacking in the mountains --  climbing around in the boonies is nothing rare for this Eagle Scout -- and  missed half of the West Hills season.  </P> <P> "When he came back, he must have hit about 11 homers in the last seven games,"  Cohen said.  </P> <P> Some say Treend is borderline wicked.  </P> <P> The enigmatic right-hander listens to heavy-metal bands such as Slayer and  Anthrax, but gravitates toward Beethoven on game days. Treend often wears a  Metallica T-shirt under his jersey.  </P> <P> "Metallica?" said Chatsworth pitcher Reed McMackin, Treend's opposite number  tonight. "Maybe he made a deal with the devil. He's been pitching like he might  have."  </P> <P> * CHAMPIONSHIP PREVIEW: C10  </P></p>

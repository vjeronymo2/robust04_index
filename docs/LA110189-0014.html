HE SAYS  WASHINGTON NOW SHOULD TAKE THE INITIATIVE TO RESTORE FRIENDLY TIES.  </P> <P> Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, in a meeting Tuesday with former President  Richard M. Nixon, accused the United States of deep involvement in last  spring's pro-democracy protest in Beijing, the official New China News Agency  reported.  </P> <P> Deng insisted that it is up to the United States, not China, to take the first  steps toward restoring more friendly relations.  </P> <P> "Frankly speaking, the United States was involved too deeply in the turmoil and  counterrevolutionary rebellion which occurred in Beijing not long ago," Deng  reportedly told Nixon in a 95-minute meeting at the Great Hall of the People.  "China was the real victim, and it is unjust to reprove China for it.  </P> <P> "We hope that China and the United States will solve as soon as possible the  problems in their relations and will create a sound basis on which to promote  future ties. However, it is up to the United States to take the initiative."  </P> <P> It was not immediately clear whether Deng's words were intended primarily for  domestic consumption or whether they might mark a further deterioration in  Sino-U.S. relations.  </P> <P> </P> <P> U.S. Envoys Harassed  </P> <P> In the past few days, there has been a marked increase in harassment of U.S.  diplomats in Beijing. A few paramilitary policemen armed with semiautomatic  weapons have stood guard outside the main U.S. Embassy compound and Ambassador  James R. Lilley's residence all summer and fall. In one of the compounds, the  United States is providing refuge to China's most prominent dissident, the  astrophysicist Fang Lizhi, and his wife.  </P> <P> Since late last week, the guard has been increased by a dozen or more  additional Chinese, some in uniform and some in civilian clothes, who stand  near the entrances and cast unfriendly looks at visitors.  </P> <P> An unidentified U.S. diplomat told the Associated Press that twice in the past  week, paramilitary guards have pointed automatic weapons at children of U.S.  diplomats and pulled the trigger. In neither case was the gun loaded.  </P> <P> In seven other recent incidents, tires have been slashed on the cars of U.S.  diplomats, and the headlights turned on so as to discharge the batteries, the  diplomat said.  </P> <P> The embassy has protested verbally to the Chinese government three times since  late last week.  </P> <P> Since mid-June, Chinese media have used edited videotapes and misleading  publications to portray the massacre on the night of last June 3-4 as a  response to -- rather than the cause of -- the rioting that took place in  Beijing the following day. Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of students and other  people were killed when the army shot its way into Beijing in the pre-dawn  hours of June 4 to retake control of Tian An Men Square from student  demonstrators.  </P> <P> Nixon, in his comments to Deng, warned the 85-year-old leader that in the 17  years since his 1972 visit to Beijing, "there has never been a more difficult  crisis" in relations between the United States and China. He warned Deng that  many Americans with long records of friendship are turning against his  government.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Friends Concerned  </P> <P> "This time the concerns developed not from those who are foes of China but from  those who are friends of China," Nixon said.  </P> <P> Something must be done, he said, to "repair the damage that has been done to  the respect in the United States among China's friends for some of China's  leaders."  </P> <P> Deng appeared to dismiss such concerns.  </P> <P> "We can never forget state sovereignty and national honor," he was quoted as  saying, "nor can we do away with national self-respect. China will not allow  any country to interfere in its internal affairs."  </P> <P> Nixon met later in the day with Jiang Zemin, who in late June replaced Zhao  Ziyang as general secretary of the Communist Party. The news agency said Jiang  "reassured Nixon that the opened door of China will not be closed again."  </P> <P> "We will not just pay lip service to upholding reform and the open policy,"  Jiang said, "but we will also take down-to-earth steps, including the  implementation of certain major projects and the improvement of relevant laws  and regulations."  </P> <P> Although martial law remains in effect in Beijing, steps are being taken to  make it less visible, partly in an attempt to encourage foreigners to return.  Armed soldiers who had stood guard at major intersections and highway  overpasses for more than four months have now been withdrawn.  </P> <P> In a special military ceremony held shortly before midnight Tuesday, the  helmeted soldiers who guarded Tian An Men Square with rifles were replaced by  less intimidating paramilitary officers, who wear cloth hats and carry only  pistols.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["News Release"] </F>   [Text] The decision of U.S. President Bill Clinton, of  Tuesday [22 March], to lift ban on the sale of arms to the  Baltic states was a logical continuation of the developments  that have taken place in the post-Communist states, opening all  world's arms markets to Estonia, head of Estonian parliament's  state defence committee Rein Helme told ETA, on Wednesday.    "The fact that the ban on arms sales was abolished proves  that the policy of the Estonian government in enacting a  demonstration breakthrough in obtaining arms from Israel was  right," Helme said, recalling the Israeli-Estonian arms deal of  $49 million, concluded last year. Helme stated that from now on  it is possible that arms will be obtained from several NATO  states, admitting, however, that there was no need for  additional large arms deals between Estonia and foreign  countries in the nearest future.    MP Trivimi Velliste told ETA that Clinton's decision was a  "serious step in strengthening the international position of the  Baltic states", which could be connected with the active  participation of the Baltic states in the Partnership for Peace  programme.</p>

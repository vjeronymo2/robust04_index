			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE OPENING QUESTION;  </P> <P> POWERSHIFT BY ALVIN TOFFLER (BANTAM: $22.95; 592 PP.)  </P> <P> Alvin Toffler's world is so rocked by "powershifts," you'd think he was writing  on the San Andreas Fault: "We live at a moment when the entire structure of  power that held the world together is now disintegrating. . . . We stand at the  edge of the deepest powershift in human history. . . . Gone is the proletariat;  now welcome the cognitariat."  </P> <P> None of us "cogs" wants to be stranded on the wrong edge of the Shift, of  course, and so it's not difficult to see why this breathless book is being  translated into 11 languages while its author lectures in America's top  boardrooms, including the White House. Hopefully, though, our fear of being  technophobic Luddites won't lead us to forget that writers have been mistaking  technological change for social change since the Industrial Revolution.  </P> <P> Toffler proves no exception: "Powershift" totters on tired theories (the move  from societies based on mineral to those based on mind), obvious aphorisms  ("Governments controlled or heavily influenced by extremists . . . do not stay  democratic long") and cryptic observations: "Campuses are stirring from  Berkeley to Rome and Taipei, preparing to explode." Berkeley, preparing to  explode?  </P> <P> Most questionable is Toffler's implicit assumption that new technologies  usually work in favor of the common man. He argues, for example, that computers  are helping "thoroughly smash" the knowledge monopoly of Western managers and  specialists, leading to a democratization of power. But in focusing on  medicine, the evidence he cites is unconvincing: True, anyone now can access  professional databases such as "Index Medicus," but medical texts have never  been inaccessible to lay people, just incomprehensible; true, patients now sue  their doctors more often, but this has less to do with their growing knowledge  of human physiology than with lawyers' greater zeal; true, nurses are demanding  more respect, but this is mostly made possible by a critical nursing shortage.  </P> <P> "Powershift" continues in this vein, distorting dozens of other trends until  they fit one of its simple paradigms. Toffler's canvass is admittedly broad  enough to daunt the best of us, but its ultimate lack of coherence ironically  disproves one of its main assumptions: that a mere abundance of information  will lead us to knowledge and thus power.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Legislative and Parliamentary Affairs Division. The  Majles held a session yesterday and the deputies of Tuysarkan,  Talesh, Eqlid, and Shadgan made speeches. Then the Majles went  into session. The details of the discussion follow for the  honorable readers.  <H5>  Seyyed Mohammad Naqbayi, Deputy From Tuysarkan </H5> <H3>  Many of the Ratifications of the 1372 [21 March 1993-20  March 1994] Budget Have in All Practicality Faced Stagnation </H3>   The first pre-agenda speaker was Naqbayi, from Tuysarkan,  who  offered his congratulations on the arrival of the month of Rajab  and condolences on the occasion of the death of Grand Ayatollah  Golpayegani and concerning the execution decree of the infidel  Salman Rushdie said: This decree cannot be canceled and is a  duty of any follower who takes steps to carry it out. Hence, I  announce to [?Gerdip], the honorable member of the 90 Green  Group of the German Parliament and all those who somehow request  a reduction or cancelation of the decree, that religious decrees  are irrevocable.    He then said: President and Speaker of the Majles, by the  approaching end of 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994], it is  worthy of note for us to know that many of the ratifications of  the 1372 budget bill have in all practicality faced stagnation  and have not been implemented. Among them is the payment of  housing loans to educators and subsidies that were to be paid,  failure to implement the ratification of the Majles concerning  rural electricity outreach, failure to provide and implement  banking loans in most ratified areas, failure to implement the  laws to facilitate the construction of housing, failure to  implement the law on natural gas outreach, etc., for which no  justified and clear reason has been offered.    He continued: I request of the honorable speaker of the  Majles, as the head of the supervisory power, and the honorable  president, as the head of the executive power, to pursue the  matter and order the related officials to present the necessary  explanations and response.    The economic and foreign currency planning of the country  and  also the writing of the budget during the life of the Majles and  prior to it indicate failure to conform words with deeds and the  actions of the theoreticians, experts, and planners threaten the  foundation of the economy and independence of the country.    The deputy from Tuysarkan also pointed out: During this  period, the vast country of the Islamic Republic of Iran has  been a laboratory and the target of invasion by the planners.  The masses of the deprived people and vulnerable and oppressed  classes have been the tools of the implementation of  experiments. The reverse is the result of the experiments of  these theoreticians in small cities, oppressed regions,  villages, agriculture, the rate of foreign currency, inflation,  and again every day the instability of the actions of previous  results and the cause of failure, dependence on the theories of  Western countries, lack of intellectual independence, fear of  precise implementation of economic issues and correct programs  of the ideology of the Koran and Islam, and failure to  understand the suffering and deprivation and taste the  bitterness of hunger. Flying towards imagination without  considering the existing conditions and lack of clear  regulations and principles to achieve definite goals, which if  continued, will ultimately confront us with the threat and many  problems for the society and revolution.    In another part of his speech, Naqbayi said: Concerning the  roads of the city of Tuysarkan within the province and the  internal roads, despite the emphasis of the president, the  assembly of the deputies of the province, and the related  officials, no steps have been taken to eliminate the problems.    He mentioned the shortage of doctors, severance of the  medicine ration of the only 24-hour pharmacy in the region by  the province, and the stopping of the only national 95-bed  hospital project among the problems, which since the time of the  previous minister have not been eliminated, despite what was  expected of Dr. Marandi.    In conclusion, he asked related officials for the change of  the labor and cooperative agencies to the related administrative  offices, which were promised this year.  <H5>  Seyyed Mojtaba-'Erfani, Deputy From Talesh </H5> <H3>  With All These Foreign Currency Problems, Still There Is No  Agreement Between the Executive Managers and Monetary Policy  Makers for the Appropriate Allocation of Our Limited Resources </H3>   The second pre-agenda speaker of the Majles was Erfani, the  deputy from Talesh, who offered his condolences on the death of  the revered Shi'ite source of Emulation, Grand Ayatollah  Golpayegani, and said: Our people, both old and young, proved  that they love the family of the prophet, the infallible imams,  and the rightful successors of the pure imams. The religious  seminaries proved that they are still the banner carriers of  struggle against the oppressors and the hope of the deprived and  the oppressed in the world.    He continued: We thank God that he has placed the  describable  love of the revered Shi'ite source of emulation and the  religious jurist, Grand Ayatollah Khamene'i, in the hearts of  the people and displayed the bravery, power, piety, and  disregard of this great man for the oppressive power and his  popularity. This the harbinger of the good news that, God  willing, once again his honor will be the spiritual source of  emulation.    In continuation, he added: The sincere and revered presence  of the people in the funeral procession of the revered source of  emulation once again struck a hard blow to the mouth of the  utterers of nonsense, who thought problems have separated people  from religion and the revolution.    These people, who deserve our service no matter how we serve  them, tolerate all the problems but condemn making peace with a  miserable America, whose poor president, in order to humiliate  Muslims, lowered himself so much to meet with Salman Rushdie and  is not disgraced. They also strongly hate the miserable  terrorist-nurturing France, which by giving shelter to the  hypocrites is trying to inflict blows on Islam and the  revolution, and they must understand that we are after the  implementation of religion and religious values and are not  afraid of such actions at all, because today the Muslim nation  has not only established an Islamic Republic regime but has also  presented itself for the awakening of the Islamic world and  return to lofty values.    He continued: Today, the experts who believe in religion  must  use their minds and, by relying on God and not unfortunately  under the influence of Westernized ideas, which have always  caused misery and misfortune for the country, for the transition  period, with appropriate reforms and in the context of the  realities of the world today, design the model for the economic  plan for the Five-Year Plan so that we can both take steps on  the course of construction and economic blossoming and also  establish divine spiritual values in the society. We must admit  that accepting the dominant existing systems is never harmonious  with our beliefs.    The deputy from Talesh continued: What has been clarified in  determining the policies governing the Second Plan by the grand  leader of the government and the officials should be put on the  agenda, because in the regime of the Islamic Republic, the  religious guardian prepares the course for political, cultural,  and economic changes through devising and approving general  policies. In other words, he prepares the ground for the divine  development of the regime.    He added: In the face of events, incidents, and changes  within the regime, we must have a change of leadership and  initiative, and in the events we must not fade and wait for  things to happen and then make decisions or in an isolationist,  reactionary form engage in negative resistance.    In planning, we must anticipate the events rather than look  for a solution after an occurrence. We must engage in cultural  planning and form the political and economic culture with the  goals of the regime of independence.    He also criticized some of the managers who are still  thinking about luxury in their place of work and make improper  expenditures and said: With all the foreign currency problems,  still there is no understanding between the executive officials  and the monetary policy makers for the appropriate allocation of  our limited resources. Everyone is trying to implement the  interests of his own section. Who must be accountable? For what  reason have those who under the pretext of importing automobile  industrial technology imported thousands of cars into the  country and wasted the foreign currency of the country not been  questioned. Why are these economic criminals not punished for  their actions, and why have these middlemen of bankrupt foreign  companies who before the interests of their country are trying  to create multinational corporations done whatever they wish?  The agreements in principle must also be investigated and the  foreign currency given to them.    Concluding, he thanked all the officials of his constituency  who with solidarity have established the religious and brotherly  spirit in the region and asked the government to expedite the  issue of the free commercial port of Bandar Anzali.  <H5>  Ahmad Nikfar, Deputy From Eqlid </H5> <H3>  Increased Economic Pressure Is by No Means in the Interest  of Our Sacred Regime </H3>   The third pre-agenda speaker of the Majles was Nikfar, from  Eqlid, who offered his congratulations on the anniversary of the  birthday of the fifth star of the heavens of the imamate and  offering his condolences on the martyrdom of the 10th infallible  imam and the death of the spiritual scholar, Grand Ayatollah  Golpayegani, said: Global oppressors, one day by means of  military invasion and another day cultural invasion and once  with an economic embargo and disrupting the trade of our Islamic  regime, try by creating and aggrandizing the problems to make  life intolerable to our revolutionary people and by driving the  people from the scene achieve their sinister goal. Considering  the timely presence of our people in the unprecedented welcome  of the visit of the grand leader to the province of Azerbaijan,  which was comparable only to the welcoming ceremonies of the  Imam of the Nation in 1357 [21 March 1978-20 March 1979], and  considering the several-million-large presence in the funeral  procession of the spiritual leader, Grand Ayatollah Golpayegani,  and the welcome by the Muslim people of the Central Asian and  African countries of the honorable President, the Muslim people  of Iran and the world have displayed their support for the  Islamic regime and dear Islam.    Hence, it is necessary for the Great Satan to learn a lesson  not to play with the pure sentiments of and all that is sacred  to the 1.5 billion Muslims in the world any longer by supporting  the infidel Rushdie, the treacherous hypocrites, usurping  Israel, and the bloodthirsty Serbs. It must know that behavior  of this kind toward the Islamic Republic of Iran and other  Islamic movements have, thank God, caused more unity of Muslims.  He continued: Today, the time has come for all the high-ranking  scholars of the Shi'ite school and the teachers of the  seminaries to hold conferences to engage in discussions on the  issue of guardianship and the successor to the Infallible Imam  during the occultation in a more clear and definite manner and  find a solution so that, God willing, Imam Khamene'i, who is  among the most learned religious jurists, will favor us and take  charge of all the affairs of Muslims. Who can doubt that if  these dear ones are negligent, the creation of confusion and  factionalism in the Islamic world will be certain.    In continuation, addressing the Judicial Branch, he said:  Unfortunately, the situation has reached a point that  bloodthirsty khans, who in the past, fearing the consequences of  the oppressive actions, crawled into their holes have even set  traps for the faithful and dutiful judges and when they fail to  make them greedy, threaten them. It has been heard that a khan,  a leftover of the Qajar kings, has sent a faithful judge a  message that he has the power to transfer him and find him a  better position in Tehran. When he did not receive a positive  response, he threatened the judge. This warning is sufficient  that through a proper and intelligent reaction these new figures  will be stopped from showing themselves once again, and the  trust and judicial security of the committed and concerned  judges will increase.    The speaker continued: We are on the verge of writing and  ratifying the Second Five-Year Plan and the 1373 [21 March  1994-20 March 1995] budget. It is necessary for the honorable  Majles and the serving government, with more investigation, if  the policy of economic modification is to continue, to make  arrangements to help the oppressed classes and those deserving  government aid, that is, the small businessmen, workers,  employees, small farmers, and those under the coverage of  emergency organizations, to benefit from the significant direct  aid of the government in an assured and continual manner,  because continuation of the existing situation, which caused  more pressure on the above-mentioned classes, is by no means in  the interest of our sacred regime. On the other hand, it is  heard that the start of new projects in the 1373 budget and the  Second Five-Year Plan has been prohibited. Yes, this is a proper  action if fairness is observed in distributing the projects,  especially large-scale investments. However, now that in many of  the oppressed cities of the country there is no sign of  large-scale investments, is it not clear and unjust  discrimination to spend existing resources to complete ongoing  projects, which are limited to some regions? Is deprivation  eliminated from the oppressed regions merely by providing water,  electricity, roads, and schools? Has the time not come for  identifying and investing in the potential of the oppressed  regions and the centers of economic, social, and cultural  developments of those regions?    He also expressed hope that in the Second Five-Year Plan a  number of projects under study will be implemented to compensate  for the witting and unwitting lack of attention in the past.    In conclusion, he thanked the Central Office of Roads and  Transport of Fars and the Construction Jihad of Eqlid and made  reminders to the Cabinet concerning more attention to the  agricultural sector.  <H5>  'Isa Moqaddamizad, Deputy From Shadegan </H5> <H3>  Ministers Must Do Their Best in Choosing Their Deputies and  the General Managers </H3>   'Isa Moqaddamizad, as the last pre-agenda speaker, offered  his condolences to all the people on the heartrending death of  the revered Shi'ite source of emulation and, offering his  congratulations on the birthday of Imam Mohammad Baqer, said:  The resistant and noble people of Khuzestan in the past week  hosted the old friend of the Imam and the eternal supporter of  the grand leader of the revolution, Mr. Nateq-Nuri. On behalf of  myself and all the deputies of this province, I thank him for  all of his kindness.    He thanked the people of the province of Khuzestan for  their welcome to the speaker of the Majles and said: Since the  Second Five-Year Plan of the government is going through its  final stages, I find it necessary to remind the ministers of  this point. You know that writing the above-mentioned plan took  a great deal of the time of the ministers, experts, and  executive officials. But more important than writing the plan is  precision in its announcement and implementation. Hence, the  ministers must do their best in choosing their deputies and  general managers and choose individuals who at least have the  following characteristics, in order for the efforts to reach  fruition and the goals of the plan to be implemented.    1) Faith in the value of work, because interest in and love  of work revive a sort of initiative and innovation in a human  being and eliminate problems.    2) Trustworthiness and commitment; no group or guild can  deny  the value of purity of the self. Lofty spirit is a  characteristic of men who have goals, who never sacrifice the  goal for their personal inclinations.    3) Knowledge and capability.    4) Decisiveness and determination in decisions. Because of  his position, a manager requires a strong will to be able to  make decisive decisions after examining all sides of an issue.    5) Humility, modesty, and belonging to the people.    6) Good past history, which can encourage the officials who  have chosen a manager without management [as published].    7) Accepting criticism. The manager must see his problems in  the mirror of other people's ideas and look fairly at the  criticism of critics.    [8)] And finally, the last characteristic of a manager is  his  perception.    Moqaddamizad, continuing, referred to the problems of his  constituency, mentioned the issue of the completion of water  outreach to 88 villages of Shadegan, and said: The manager of  the Water and Electricity Organization of Khuzestan, in regards  to the second phase of the irrigation and drainage network of  Shadegan last year, gave me false information and said that he  had announced the funds for the above-mentioned phase to the  Mahab-e Qods Company. But after the matter was pursued, the  contrary was proved, whereas the timely implementation of this  project can have a vital role for my constituency.    Then, in connection with the completion of the construction  operation of the educational affairs of Shadegan and payment of  loans to people who reside in 80 villages, which fell victim to  floods in the region, he asked the related officials for help  and cooperation.    Concluding, he thanked the officials of the Emergency  Committee who were able to aid in the marriages of a number of  brides and grooms on the birthday of her holiness Zahra.  <H5>  Ratification </H5>   The first item on the agenda of the open session of the  Majles yesterday was the report on the first round of  discussions of the Islamic Guidance and Art Committee concerning  the proposal to attach the National Library to the Ministry of  Islamic Culture and Guidance.    Regarding the general points of the proposal, Morteza Nabavi  said in support of this proposal: This library must be under the  supervision of the Ministry of Guidance. In terms of comparison  with other parts of the world, statistics show that in most  countries, the National Library is under the supervision of the  executive organization in charge of culture and information  outreach issues. And if we do not want to make a comparison with  other countries, in our own country, the president has a great  deal to do. Since 1369 [21 March 1990-20 March 1991], when this  law was ratified, the president has had the opportunity to  participate in one session and examine this matter.    The deputy of the people of Tehran then rejected the  reasoning of the opponents that this law has been ratified  previously and it would not be proper for the Majles to change  it and said: The charter of this library, which has been  ratified by the Majles, is not supposed to change. Only the  place of the library, which concerns the Ministry of Guidance,  will be changed.    He also added: Some of the opponents have stated that we  shall have the problem of parallel organizations. Some of our  colleagues have reached the conclusion that this law should be  amended, like other laws, and put in place. This is very  logical. This action will include the elimination of parallel  organizations as the president at the present manages this task,  and also it is the duty of the Ministry of Guidance.    Dr. Sheybani said in opposition to the proposal: We have one  library so large in the country, and that is the National  Library, which must be operated under the supervision of the  highest executive authority in the country, who should have an  open hand and provide more resources. When this issue came up, I  went to the president and said, Is there any reason why you  cannot attend to this library? He said: "No, in fact, I can  provide more resources."    He then said: We should not do something to bring the  National Library to the level of other libraries and then  ultimately be unable to attend to it. This library is a national  treasure, not to mention that its president is a person who was  the minister of guidance once and previously engaged in vast  propaganda in Europe in the Hamburg mosque. He is a person who  is known to everyone.    'Ata'ollah Mohajerani, the parliamentary deputy of the  president, then explained: Essentially, the strength and  credibility of the Majles is in proportion to the strength and  the credibility of the laws. If the laws of a country change,  openly in the mind of the people the belief will exist that the  law can be changed. Hence, we must act in a way that we only  change the law when necessary, and do it tastefully. In the  Third Majles, separating the National Library from the Ministry  of Guidance and attaching it to the presidential institution was  not a political idea but one of expertise. Certainly, the Fourth  Majles also will look at the law from the perspective of  expertise, and ultimately the government will implement the  ratifications of the Majles.    After the speech of the government representative,  Zare'i-Qanavati, the spokesman of the Guidance Committee said:  None of the deputies oppose the National Library, and all agree  that the library must be expanded.    He then said: To say that this proposal has not been made  out  of necessity is not correct. The reasons for the committee  ratifying the proposal were expert arguments not issues of  factional and personal taste. These issues, thank God, do not  govern the committee. If the Administrative Committee has voted  negatively regarding the above-mentioned proposal, it means that  the committee has seen its organizational problems and given an  opinion, whereas the expert Guidance Committee has seen the  cultural coordination in the country and in all the sessions of  the committee is concerned about the culture of the country.  Hence, by attaching this library to the Ministry of Guidance, a  great deal of coordination will be created in the culture of the  country.    After the explanations of the spokesman of the committee,  the  general points of the proposal were put to a vote and were not  ratified. There were 86 supporting and 93 opposing votes.    The second item on the agenda was the urgent proposal on the  procedures for punishing individuals who engage in illegal  audiovisual activities. The general points of the proposal were  put to a vote and ratified. The details of the proposal will be  discussed in the next session.    Article 1 of the above-mentioned proposal, which had been  proposed by the Judicial Committee, states: Any person who  engages in any action regarding illegal audiovisual materials in  place of legal materials or violates the rights of the owners of  the work, including forgery of the official label of the  Ministry of Islamic Culture and Guidance on tapes or changing  the tape or the content of the tape cassettes that have labels  and the like, in addition to punishment for forgery and damages  according to the case, if demanded, he shall be fined 2 million  to 20 million rials.    Note. During the phase of determining whether the action has  taken place, the court may use the expert opinion of the  Ministry of Islamic Culture and Guidance as its standard.  <H5>  On the Margins of the Majles </H5> <H5>  Bylaws Reminder of the Deputy of Lenjan </H5>   In connection with the discussion concerning the attachment  of the National Library to the Ministry of Islamic Culture and  Guidance not being a political but an expert decision, Mr.  Kuhkan said in a bylaws reminder: We did not expect our dear  brother, Mr. Mohajerani, to speak in this manner, that the Third  Majles dealt with proposals and bills from an expert perspective  and now it is done from a perspective of personal taste. Since  we signed this proposal and spoke in support of it, I think his  address includes me, as well, as one of the signatories and  speakers, and I consider his statement an insult to the Majles  in mentioning the opinion of the Fourth Majles in this case as  having been based on personal taste rather than expert opinion.    In this connection, Mr. Mohajerani in yesterday's issue of  ETTELA'AT, in an article entitled "Criticism of the Situation,"  defended his speech in opposition to the proposal to attach the  National Library to the Ministry of Guidance and said: "The  problem is that sometimes an honorable deputy...regards his own  preference or that of a few people as the opinion of the Majles."    In continuation, he added: "Neither did I mean that the  Fourth Majles acts inexpertly, as the evidence came like  lightening and the proposal to attach the National Library was  rejected, nor can the preference of a few deputies be regarded  as that of the Majles. The Majles is not formed of a building,  chairs, and discussions. The basic identity of the Majles is in  its votes."    In explaining the statements of Mr. Mohajerani, it can be  said that the number of supporting and opposing notes shows that  the person making the objection is right, because if "the basic  identity of the Majles is in its votes," there are 86 supporting  and 93 opposing votes. In other words, the votes of 86 persons  cannot be regarded as merely the preference of a few people,  because there is a difference of only seven votes. It seems that  the accusation by Mr. Kuhkan has remained unanswered.  <H5>  Five Days With the War-Scarred People of Khuzestan </H5> <H5>  Seyyed Amir Purfazeli, Dispatched Reporter. Part 2 </H5>   On Sunday afternoon, 14/09/1372 [5 December 1993], Mr.  Nateq-Nuri participated unexpectedly in the marriage ceremonies  of 600 couples of the Imam Khomeyni Emergency Committee of the  province of Khuzestan, which was truly very attractive and  enjoyable. Their presence in this interesting and spiritually  joyful gathering revived every one revived from the tiredness of  the trip. I will never forget this memorable gathering. Truly we  must say to the unknown members of the Emergency Committee who  work sincerely: Well done. After these exciting ceremonies, Mr.  Nateq-Nuri took part in a gathering of Ahvaz University people  and responded to the questions of the officials with regard to  political and cultural areas. This great gathering, in which a  large number of students participated, was interesting. They  welcomed the speaker of the Majles warmly. Of course, in this  meeting, many questions were posed by the students, of which the  speaker of the Majles responded to a few, due to the shortage of  time. Among the questions posed to him was one concerning  "Raja'i-Khorasani," which resulted in a heated discussion. He  was asked, "Considering his letter, why was he not dismissed  from the Majles?" Mr. Nateq-Nuri responded: "In the Majles, we  do not have a law that if a deputy makes a speech, we can  dismiss him as a deputy. I myself spoke in detail in connection  with his letter on 13 Aban [4 November] and condemned this idea.  I do not agree with him at all. The fact is that the newspapers  are making an issue of Mr. Raja'i-Khorasani. On the one hand, if  someone is arrested, they say there is no freedom of expression  and democracy. But if a person writes a letter to the leader of  the revolution and gives us a copy, does making a ruckus against  him indicate democracy and freedom of expression? This action  does not conform religiously and legally with democracy and  freedom. Hence, I reject and condemn the opinion of Mr.  Raja'i-Khorasani.    "I announced earlier that the alley that ends in America is  a  dead-end alley." When the speaker of the Majles made this  statement in a loud voice, the sound of "God is great" by the  students shook the amphitheater of the university. Among the  other questions by the students was the issue of national  economy, to which Mr. Nateq-Nuri gave a strong and dignified  answer. Also, among other questions was that of relations with  South Africa, to which the speaker of the Majles responded: As  long as the white racists are in charge, we will not have  relations with them. At this moment, the minister of agriculture  said: The blacks are supposed to come to power.    And Mr. Nateq-Nuri immediately said: "If they come to power,  we shall have no problems with them."    Among the other questions by the students was a question  concerning relations with Egypt. The speaker of the Majles said:  "The grand leader of the revolution agreed to relations with  Egypt at a certain level."    After this meeting, Mr. Nateq-Nuri went to a gathering of  the  brave people of Ahvaz, a stronghold of combative forces, and  spoke of their self-sacrifice and bravery and praised them.    On Monday morning, 15/09/1372 [6 December 1993], the speaker  of the Majles, in order to become familiar with the  implementation of the Karun River dredging operation, visited  the above-mentioned project. The project began four months ago  to provide protection against seasonal flooding and to stabilize  the Karun River banks, and it is anticipated that it will be  completed in 32 months, if funds and heavy machinery are  provided.    Afterwards, Mr. Nateq-Nuri went to Susangerd to visit with  the resistant people of that city. During the imposed war this  city was occupied twice by the Ba'thists, but with the bravery  and resistance of the Hezbollah forces, the Ba'thist mercenaries  could not stay in that city for even one day. The same people,  on seeing the speaker of the Majles, became joyful and welcomed  him and his companions enthusiastically. During the moments that  we spent in Susangerd, the signs of deprivation and damage from  the war were evident.    The implementation of the developmental projects will cause  the city to thrive and repair the war damage. The first  implementation of the project in the city was the natural gas  outreach, water and sewage, and the establishment of Payam-e Nur  University in Susangerd, all of which were visited by the  speaker of the Majles, which will be encouraging to the  war-stricken people of this city.    When Mr. Nateq-Nuri went to the gathering of the resistant  people of this city, the city stadium was filled with men and  women. He said: "What we all wish is to sacrifice ourselves for  you people. I believe that you have not received what you  deserve. No matter how much work is done around the clock, it is  still too little."</p>

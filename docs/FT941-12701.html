			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / International Company News: Mixed fortunes for United, Delta United Airlines, the biggest US carrier, yesterday reported a sharp reduction in net losses to Dollars 64m from Dollars 224m for its fourth quarter, leaving net losses for the full year at Dollars 50m, compared with Dollars 957m last time. Delta Air Lines, in contrast, reported net losses of Dollars 141m for its second quarter ended in December, almost unchanged from the previous year's loss of Dollars 144.4m. Delta said the losses would have been half that size without the inclusion of a Dollars 112.3m pre-tax charge for the early retirement of 1,492 staff. Delta also reported that if its financial year had run from January to December 1993, it would have turned in net losses of Dollars 225.9m - a big drop from the previous calendar year's losses of Dollars 601.4m before accounting changes and Dollars 1.19bn after the changes. One factor helping both airlines during the quarter was the flight attendants' strike at their biggest rival, American Airlines, in November. They also benefited from the fall in oil prices. But like other large US airlines, United and Delta suffered tough competition on domestic short-haul routes from low-cost competitors such as Southwest Airlines. Mr Stephen Wolf, United's chairman and chief executive, said that although the fourth-quarter and full-year figures showed a vast improvement over the previous year's, United was 'far from satisfied with what must be characterised as unacceptable results.' Last month United negotiated a deal with unions giving employees a majority stake in the airline in exchange for wage cuts and productivity improvements. 'The provisions included in the employee stock ownership transaction specifically address our need to compete effectively in short-haul markets, while at the same time allowing us to reduce labour costs throughout our world-wide system,' Mr Wolf said. United's fourth-quarter revenues rose by 14 per cent to Dollars 3.6bn from Dollars 3.2bn and losses per share fell to Dollars 3.02 from Dollars 9.27. For the full year, revenues rose by 13 per cent to Dollars 14.5bn from Dollars 12.9bn, and losses per share fell to Dollars 3.40 from Dollars 39.75  -though the previous year's full-year figure included an after-tax charge of Dollars 540m for accounting changes. Mr Ron Allen, Delta's chairman and chief executive, said the airline had cut 7,235 staff, or 10 per cent of its workforce, since 1992, and had cut Dollars 7.3bn from planned capital spending between now and 1996 by deferring aircraft deliveries. Second-quarter turnover rose to Dollars 3bn from Dollars 2.9bn and losses per share fell to Dollars 3.36 from Dollars 3.46.</p>

			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MALCOLM FORBES' BIRTHDAY BASH  </P> <P> I opened my Sunday paper and thought they had delivered a copy of USA Today by  mistake. Since when does a wealthy man's extravagant birthday party deserve  front-page coverage in The Times? I found your choice of a photo, showing  Malcolm Forbes and Elizabeth Taylor fronting two black men dressed as Nubian  guards (or slaves), in extremely poor taste. Maybe the picture helped you sell  newspapers. Mine went immediately in the garbage where it belonged.  </P> <P> SHELLEY PRITIKIN  </P> <P> Del Mar  </P></p>

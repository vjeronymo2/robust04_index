			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Practical Success"] </F>   [Text] It is impractical to look for a spectacular outcome  to the Rao-Clinton talks; this was not expected from Prime  Minister Narasimha Rao's U.S. visit. There were already  indications that no solution would be found to the differences  between India and America, and it was not expected that India's  standing would suddenly rise in the eyes of U.S. statesmen and  businessmen. The only hope was that the summit meeting between  India and America would produce a better understanding, which  had been weak for a number of years. With this personal  communication between the heads of government of the two  countries, more businesslike ties might develop between India  and America. Relations have previously been bogged down in a  quagmire of bureaucratic language and prejudice.    From this point of view, Narasimha Rao's visit can be termed  a success. In his joint news conference, the prime minister  stated that the talks were "constructive, useful, and  forthright." The forthrightness is reflected in the fact that  both leaders agreed there are differences that still persist.  India reiterated its stance regarding the NPT [Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty], human rights, and Kashmir, but America  remained steadfast in its reasoning. The talks were useful in  the sense that India could properly gauge U.S. priorities for  the first time. For his part, the prime minister tried to  emphasize not only that India is the largest democratic country  with a potential to emerge as the greatest market in the world,  but its humanitarian and pacifist concerns are no less than  those of America.    The constructive nature of the talks will only become known  in the future. The prime minister proposed that for the sake of  a nuclear-free world there should be agreement on "no first  strike" with nuclear weapons. He also agreed that a program of  joint exercises between Indian and U.S. forces should be  undertaken to safeguard South Asian and Pacific security. If  these things are considered constructive, that is one matter;  the true usefulness of the prime minister's visit was the  possibility of heavy U.S. investment in India. How far  Narasimha Rao succeeded in this regard will become known only  after concrete results are achieved.    The prime minister's visit proved useful in one sense. Even  though President Clinton declared India the biggest successful  democracy and praised its contributions, this feeling was  neither reflected in the U.S. media nor in the behavior of U.S.  senators. The U.S. media ignored the prime minister's visit from  the beginning, and when they did notice, they treated it as an  insignificant event. U.S. statesmen were so indifferent toward  the prime minister's address to a joint session of Congress that  only three dozen members from both houses came to listen.  Newspapers ignored the event completely. Most of the questions  asked in the joint news conference were addressed to President  Clinton, and many had no bearing on Indo-U.S. relations. This  indifference came despite the fact that this was the first state  visit by an Indian prime minister in many years; Rajiv Gandhi  was the last prime minister to visit the United States. This  attitude has nothing to do with the prime minister's success or  failure, but the inherent fact that India is not a U.S. priority  cannot be ignored. It is therefore easy to understand that in  the present atmosphere we will not be able to carve the proper  niche for ourselves in Western politics -- which move on the  basis of power and prosperity -- by extolling goodwill and our  cultural superiority. India is not considered great on the  basis of population, natural resources, or democratic tradition.  It will have to transfer these attributes into solid results.  It is futile to repeat Jawaharlal's prophecy that the next  century would be a U.S. century; we will have to find a strategy  to make the next century belong to India.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Federation Council Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko </F> marking Russia's Independence Day, on 11 June; place not given  -- recorded]    [Text] [Shumeyko] The declaration of the sovereignty of  Russia was adopted four years ago, on 12 June 1990. All the  deputies stood up and greeted this with long applause. Probably  not everyone thought then what sovereignty was about, what a  free state was. The fact of the matter is that many deputies,  almost the overwhelming majority at the Russian Congress of  People's Deputies, won the elections on denial, on the denial of  the system that existed then, on the denial of the CPSU as the  power in Russia, the power on which the whole Soviet Union was  based. Appealing to their electorate, they said: We are fed up  with all of this. We cannot live like this any longer. We  cannot live any longer in this totalitarian state in which man,  his spirit repressed, where none of us is free. The electorate  agreed with them. They elected these deputies.    The time has come for reflection -- if we are deputies of  the  Russian Federation -- where is that Russia, what sort of a state  is it? How should it be built and developed further? When the  sovereignty of Russia was declared the Soviet Union was in  existence. There was the center. There was the CPSU Central  Committee Politburo. There was Gorbachev, the general secretary  who announced perestroyka, acceleration, the building of  socialism with a human face. That classic phrase, the process  has got under way [as heard] belongs to him. Where has it "got  under way" to?    All of that so-called perestroyka in my view was  characterized by a whole series of economic crimes, which  essentially led to the complete failure of the socialist  economy, of an economy that was formed way back during Stalinist  five-year plans, an economy that was then supported by everyone.  But out of all the decisions that were made, I recall one hazy  fact -- we woke up one morning and we were told: We will form  cooperatives and that is it -- there will be happiness.    Students will work there, the unemployed section of the  population, pensioners -- they will produce so much from  remnants and scraps resulting from productive processes that our  store shelves will be cracking under the weight of goods. How  wonderful cooperatives are, they kept saying.    Then we woke up one beautiful morning to hear: No to  cooperatives, cooperatives are bad, they should be banned and  destroyed.    Then they allowed cooperatives to turn non-cash into cash.  Only now have I discovered that in that period, during eight  months of 1988, 600 billion rubles were converted from non-cash  into cash. That is 600 billion of those rubles. In today's  money it is 600 trillion. All goods disappeared. By the end of  1990 they just disappeared -- all -- remember empty shelves in  Moscow! The market of goods disappeared. One could return it  only by freeing prices. But we did not know it then! Nobody  knew how the economy would develop.    The sovereign and free Russia became the heir to the Soviet  Union at the exact moment when the socialist economy was  finished for good -- when there were empty shelves, barter  relations, and so on. First we were fighting to separate  ourselves from the center and to prove that Russia is  independent and sovereign -- and we proved it. However, this  sovereign independent state was left with all the problems  accumulated by the previous leadership. This old leadership  dumped them, as it were, on the new leadership.    Now there is an interesting fact -- there are claims that it  is Yeltsin and the Gaydar government that are to blame for  everything, and for breaking apart this powerful great Soviet  Union. Now nobody remembers, even for a minute, that the  shelves were empty, that there were huge lines, that Valentin  Pavlov changed money, and so on. All these brawls are  forgotten, and now there are new difficulties.    June 12 is a holiday despite everything, a great holiday.  Why? Because it is from that day that we started building the  new Russia. Not even new, to be exact. It is impossible to  build Russia from scratch. Russia is a universe, a huge state,  which at some point of its development turned into an empire  from sea to sea. On its way, Russia absorbed new peoples,  cultures, confessions and traditions. It turned into a  multi-ethnic multi-million state.    It remains the same today. But today it is no longer a  single state, it is not under the authority of the csar or the  general secretary -- csar or center, it is all the same. Today,  at last, Russia is free in the respect that it is a federal  state. Thanks to Russia becoming a sovereign state, a federal  state, it has been preserved as a single state and has not  disintegrated. But today everybody should be thinking about how  to preserve, how to strengthen, how to consolidate the state, in  the first place. It would be better if we learned to think:  First of all, we are citizens of Russia and then politicians,  because today many decisions are taken to gratify immediate  political aims, to please a political group, party or faction,  and so on and so forth. But people lead quite different lives  -- not at all like politicians. They want the state to be  powerful and strong, to allow man to live alright, to earn as  much money as he can, to provide for his family.    We are building a law-governed state where law is the  cornerstone. No matter what is said, nonetheless, the  Constitution was adopted on 12 December 1993. This Constitution  contains all the achievements of socialism in the social  respect. As for spiritual values -- they are enshrined in it --  free education, health care, the possibility to live as a human  being in that society. For the first time human rights have  been secured. The Constitution has started to operate directly.  If the Constitution is violated, a person has the right to go  to court. But all of that still has to be built. The  Constitution's operation must be ensured. Society is still  living by other laws and nobody goes to court when his rights  are violated.    The first stage of democratic transformations and the  construction of a law-governed state began on 12 June 1990 when  sovereignty was declared. The second stage of our life began on  12 December 1993 when the new Constitution was adopted.    These two stages were completely different. The first stage  was the romantic transition to democracy, when everything seemed  quick, everything seemed possible. It seemed that there would  be mutual understanding between everyone. But then colossal  economic difficulties set in, every day, ordinary life began.  Then it was no longer good enough to make speeches, call people  out on the streets, hold rallies, it was time to work. Every  day.    Over these four years, it was my fortune to be a deputy  chairman of the Supreme Soviet and first deputy prime minister  of the government. I now lead the Federation Council. How  should those in power today be described?    I would put it like this. Today they are concerned about the  state to a greater degree. In the past, the authorities were  more concerned about staying in power. There was also a stage  when it seemed to the Moscow authorities, the people here, that  they were actually the only authority in Russia. It seemed that  Moscow could take decisions for the whole of Russia. That was a  great mistake. They failed to appreciate that the regional  authorities were just as, or even more powerful.    Ask me when I had the greatest power and I can tell you that  it was when I was a director general. I had 13,000 staff and I  had full authority over all the issues at my industrial  association.    Now, despite the lofty post, I have a lot less real power.  Perhaps it is of a different sort, manifesting itself in a  different way? The Federation Council, which represents the  subjects of the Federation, is the essence of that authority of  the regions, which is really the authority of Russia, that power  which is being wielded among people every day. Those in power  now are basically characterized by their awareness that things  are done, not at the center, not in Moscow, but in consultation  with everyone, all over Russia. The greater this awareness, the  better for Russia. Those in power need to understand that the  more you give the more you receive.</p>

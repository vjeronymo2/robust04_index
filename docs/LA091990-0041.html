			<p><P> September 19, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: MOORPARK;  </P> <P> CITY PROGRAMS IN SCHOOLS GET REPRIEVE  </P> <P> The Moorpark school board, after threatening two weeks ago to throw city  programs out of all the district's school buildings, has decided to allow the  programs to remain for 30 days.  </P> <P> The board had cut off use of all school facilities by the city's park and  recreation program. The action stemmed from a two-year battle between the city  and the district over the sale of a closed school in the downtown area.  </P> <P> Board President Patty Waters said a letter sent to the city Friday said "an  extension to the 30 days can be forthcoming."

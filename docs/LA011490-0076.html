			<p><P> January 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INNOCENT VICTIMS  </P> <P> On Jan. 3, I was arrested for civil disobedience at the Los Angeles Federal  Building. I had never been arrested before.  </P> <P> I was afraid to put myself in that position, but more afraid not to.  </P> <P> Arrest was my way of solidarity with the people of El Salvador whose lives,  dreams, hopes and desires are arrested.  </P> <P> I was also there for the equally innocent victims here in the United States.  </P> <P> I am tired of washing blood from my shoes after praying in emergency rooms  beside young bodies first shot up with guns then cut up like a side of beef by  doctors trying in vain to save their lives. I am tired of burying 18 and 19  year olds, cousins and brothers, nieces and nephews of the same family. I am  tired of the fear that grips the elderly who are afraid to come out at night  because of the gang and drug violence that claims the lives of our youth.  </P> <P> I am tired of burying infants because mothers could not afford decent prenatal  care right here in Southern California. I am tired of seeing teens drop out of  school because they cannot keep up or because their families need them to work  or because they have no hope of a decent income unless they sell drugs.  </P> <P> For these victims, the unknown of America and El Salvador, I risked arrest and  for them I will do so again.  </P> <P> REV. WILLIAM T.  </P> <P> EASTERLING  </P> <P> Associate Pastor  </P> <P> St. Joseph's Catholic Church  </P> <P> Pomona  </P></p>

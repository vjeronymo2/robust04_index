			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / French 'alliance' gains in popularity THE cohabitation alliance between France's veteran Socialist president, Mr Francois Mitterrand, and the new conservative prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur, is gaining popularity according to the latest opinion poll. Mr Mitterrand, whose popularity fell sharply during the final months of the old Socialist government, saw his approval rating rise by 5 percentage points to 46 per cent in May, according to a BVA-Paris Match survey. Mr Balladur's rating rose by 2 points to 59 per cent. The president and prime minister appear to have won the electorate's approval because of their conciliatory approach to cohabitation. The last cohabitation administration, from 1986 to 1988, was scarred by frequent rows between the president and Mr Jacques Chirac, the centre-right prime minister.</p>

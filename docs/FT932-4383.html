			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / International Company News: S Korea to open bond market to foreigners SOUTH Korea's bond market may be opened to foreign investors within a year and the ceiling on foreign ownership on Korean stocks may be raised, AP-DJ reports from Seoul. Mr Hong Jae-hyong, finance minister, hinted that the bond market would most likely be opened to foreign investors as early as next year or, at the latest, before 1996. He said the foreign ownership ceiling on Korean stocks, now 10 per cent of a listed company, would be raised several times over the next five years but he refused to give an exact timetable and the maximum ceiling. The Seoul Stock Exchange was opened to foreign investors in January 1992. Mr Hong said Japan had taken 20 years to complete its stock market opening programme, but South Korea would open its market to a significant level over the next five to six years. 'It took 10 years for the US and Japan to deregulate interest rates but South Korea will liberalise all controls on interest rates, except for those on demand deposits, over the next three to four years,' Mr Hong said. Foreign financial institutions would be guaranteed the opportunity to do business in Korea on an equal footing with their local counterparts, he said.</p>

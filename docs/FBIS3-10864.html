			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>   [Text] Rafael Aguilar Talamantes, presidential candidate  for the Cardenist Front for National Reconstruction [PFCRN],  visited Leon, Guanajuato, and commented on statements made by  Manuel Camacho Solis.    [Begin Aguilar recording] Today more than ever, and after  hearing Camacho's Messianic words, I am more convinced that the  PFCRN and its supporters must work hard to ensure a victory in  the 21 August elections. With those illuminating statements he  is asking the homeland to pay for services rendered and  recognize him as a savior. He said this country will be  democratized and that it will overcome its difficulties. We do  not need transition governments. We need stable, constitutional  governments that will govern for everyone. That is why I will  repeat that Camacho showed his true colors today during the news  conference. He showed himself to be a real fire-eater [traga  fuego] who is plotting behind the curtains of the Presidential  Palace. Beware. [end recording]</p>

			<p><P> July 7, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW PHOTO MUSEUM DIRECTOR IS KEEPING HIS PERSPECTIVE;  </P> <P> PHOTOGRAPHY: HEAD OF RIVERSIDE INSTITUTION IS BUILDING A LOCAL CONSTITUENCY . .  . AND WANTS TO APPEAL TO ANGELENOS, TOO.  </P> <P> When he first heard that UC Riverside's California Museum of Photography needed  a director, Jonathan W. Green said to himself, "Oh, great. L.A."  </P> <P> What did he know? From his vantage point in Columbus, Ohio, Riverside and Los  Angeles sounded like the same big, sprawling city.  </P> <P> Checking into the situation, Green discovered that Riverside is 1 1/2 to 3  hours from Los Angeles -- depending upon traffic -- and that the psychological  distance looms even longer in some Angelenos' heads. He heard of Westsiders who  refuse to drive to downtown Los Angeles, much less to Riverside's  well-populated hinterland.  </P> <P> Enlightened but undaunted, Green resigned as director of exhibitions at the  Wexner Center for the Visual Arts at Ohio State University and headed west. The  50-year-old photographer, author, historian and critic is now director of the  California Museum of Photography in downtown Riverside.  </P> <P> The museum -- which boasts a collection of 18,000 photographs by recognized  masters, 100,000 images documenting a century of world history, 250,000  stereoscopic prints and negatives, and 6,000 cameras and related pieces of  equipment -- was established in 1973 at UC Riverside. The museum was lodged in  an old house on campus until last April, when it moved to a cleverly  refurbished Kress variety store on the downtown pedestrian mall. With a new  public face and a more accessible location -- however distant from Los Angeles  -- the museum is poised to play a stronger role in Southern California's art  scene and to raise its national and international profile.  </P> <P> "The museum is well known in the photography community," Green said,  acknowledging that he has something of a sleeper on his hands. "(Former  director) Charles Desmarais and the museum's small staff have accomplished a  small miracle by getting the museum built and running a strong program with  limited resources," he said, but now it's time to expand the program and  increase the audience.  </P> <P> Challenge No. 1, as Green sees it, is "to understand the relationship between  Riverside and Los Angeles, and how to bridge that gap." That dilemma is part of  what he calls "the dual challenge of building a constituency in Riverside  County and doing the kind of shows that will make people in Los Angeles think  that it's worth the drive to come out here."  </P> <P> The museum's potential is enormous, but the task of realizing that potential is  extremely complex. To be successful, the California Museum of Photography must  not only become part of greater Los Angeles' art community, it must also serve  the university's needs as well as those of Riverside's lay audience.  </P> <P> "The key point that made the job interesting to me was that the university had  the vision to build the museum in the middle of the community," Green said.  "There's an exciting potential in reaching both ways. The university has  intellectual and academic responsibilities, but it also provides leverage and  resources to mesh with the community. My problem is how to get the most  interesting work to the largest audience.  </P> <P> "Coming from the Midwest, I'm concerned about how to make the collection  relevant and accessible to the Hispanic population here. The population is 40%  Chicano in this area. We want to play a role in the Riverside area, so we will  institute bilingual programs and undoubtedly add staff members from minority  groups," he said.  </P> <P> Many demands facing the museum can be met by sensitive and creative  programming, Green said. "I hope to concentrate on three words in the title,  California Museum of Photography. We should try to identify as clearly as  possible what it means to be a museum in the late 20th Century in the arena of  photography, and to address regional issues in California," he said.  </P> <P> Green envisions a three-part program: "At all times I expect to have a  historical show that reevaluates material in the collection in terms of current  thought and critical theories. There will also be a contemporary show that will  include work by local artists and artists from other parts of California. The  third exhibition, running simultaneously, will expand the traditional notion of  photography to include film, video, performance and mixed-media work that  incorporates photography."  </P> <P> This third category is a new direction, and it will bring work into the museum  that does not look like photography. This move is likely to meet resistance  from the museum's traditional audience, but there is no reason to separate  contemporary photography from the rest of art now that it has become so  thoroughly assimilated, Green noted.  </P> <P> Photography still occupies a special place in the art world, however. "One of  the reasons that photography is pro-active in recent political and social  issues is that it continually focuses back on the real world. Photographers  tend not to hide in ivory towers," he said.  </P> <P> Green, who has been a review panelist and consultant for the National Endowment  for the Arts, said he expects the museum to "make a concerted response to the  censorship issue."  </P> <P> A free-lance photographer and author of five books on photography, Green has  arrived in California after a 22-year career in the Northeast and Midwest. He  joined the faculty of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1968,  teaching photography and directing the institute's Creative Photography  Laboratory and Gallery. In 1976, he moved to Ohio State University, where he  spearheaded the widely acclaimed Wexner Center for the Visual Arts, a  $43-million museum and multidisciplinary art center that opened last year.  </P></p>

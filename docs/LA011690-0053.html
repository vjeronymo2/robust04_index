			<p><P> January 16, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STOCKS;  </P> <P> PRICES CONTINUE TO SLIDE; DOW LOSES 19.84  </P> <P> Prices declined broadly on Wall Street on Monday as pessimism about the economy  -- which sent stocks sharply lower on Friday -- took a further toll on the  market.  </P> <P> "They don't see any reason to take an aggressive stand on the buy side,"  Michael Metz, an analyst with Oppenheimer &amp; Co., said of traders.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones industrial index fell 19.84 to 2,669.37.  </P> <P> Declining issues outnumbered advancers by about 11 to 4 in nationwide trading  of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 395 stocks rising, 1,091 falling  and 466 unchanged.  </P> <P> Big Board volume totaled a moderate 140.59 million shares, down from 183.88  million Friday.  </P> <P> Analysts said the malaise that settled over Wall Street after two negative  economic reports Friday remained in place Monday.  </P> <P> Bargain hunters who might normally enter the market after a sharp loss stayed  on the sidelines Monday, said Dennis Jarrett, an analyst with Kidder, Peabody  &amp; Co. Jarrett described traders as apathetic.  </P> <P> A telephone company circuit failure halted delivery of markets data Monday from  the New York and American stock exchanges to Associated Press.  </P> <P> As a result, some of the stock tables compiled and transmitted by the AP were  delayed and others did not reflect final closing prices for some stocks.  </P> <P> AP said the outage appeared to be a local problem in New York and not related  to widespread long-distance calling problems with American Telephone &amp;  Telegraph Co.  </P> <P> Stock prices finished lower on the London Stock Exchange, although well above  the day's lows. The Financial Times 100-share index fell 13.9 points to close  2,366.2.  </P> <P> CREDIT  </P> <P> Campeau Filing Hits Junk Bonds  </P> <P> Junk bond prices fell after a bankruptcy court filing by two Campeau Corp.  units, whose financial troubles triggered the high-yield bond market's severe  tailspin last fall.  </P> <P> "Whenever that happens it is a disturbing event and it's a drag on the market  and it was," said Robert Lupo, director of high-yield bond research at Smith  Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co.  </P> <P> Traders said issues of high-yield bonds on average fell about 1/4 point to 1/2  point. The movement of a point equals a change of $10 on a $1,000 bond. The  widely watched 13.71% RJR Holdings Capital Corp. bond due in 2009 was down  about 7/8 point at 90 7/8.  </P> <P> The decision by Campeau's Federated Department Stores Inc. and Allied Stores  Corp. to seek protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy  law drew a subdued reaction because it had been expected, traders said.  </P> <P> The government securities market was closed Monday. Prices of corporate and  municipal bonds were slightly lower in quiet trading, said Eric Friedlander, a  corporate bond trader with Prudential-Bache Securities Corp.  </P> <P> In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal  bonds was 92.875, down 3/32 point. The average yield to maturity rose to 7.30%  from 7.29% late Friday.  </P> <P> CURRENCY  </P> <P> Dollar Gains in Light Trading  </P> <P> The dollar rose against most major foreign currencies in light trading, as  holidays in Japan and the United States sharply reduced worldwide activity.  </P> <P> Gold prices also advanced. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a late bid  of $414.80 an ounce, up from $414.50 late Friday. On New York's Commodity  Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery rose to $413.70 an ounce from  $413.20 last Friday.  </P> <P> Dealers said trading activity was reduced due to the Martin Luther King Day  holiday in the United States and a national holiday in Japan, both of which  closed banks -- the biggest players in the world foreign-exchange market.  </P> <P> Dealers in Europe said the dollar's rise was fueled by a weakening of the West  German mark against the Japanese yen and against the British pound.  </P> <P> The mark was pushed lower by an initial drop in Frankfurt, West Germany, share  prices that was sharper than many traders had expected following Friday's fall  on Wall Street. The mark has derived support in recent months from foreign  investor interest in West German shares.  </P> <P> COMMODITIES  </P> <P> Warm Weather Cools Oil Prices  </P> <P> Heating oil futures prices tumbled on the New York Mercantile Exchange as  unseasonably warm weather spread across the country, easing demand for home  heating fuel.  </P> <P> On other commodity markets, orange juice futures ended mixed after soaring  early in the session. Futures prices for precious metals, grains and soybeans,  and livestock and meat also finished mixed.  </P> <P> Most wholesale heating oil futures fell 1.85 to 2 cents, the permitted daily  limit. The contract for delivery in February, on which the limit has been  lifted pending its Jan. 31 expiration, crashed 5.05 cents to settle at 64.60  cents a gallon.  </P> <P> Futures prices for West Texas Intermediate crude oil tumbled 22 to 77 cents  with February at $22.36 a barrel; unleaded gasoline futures settled 1.14 to 1.5  cents lower with February at 63.59 cents a gallon.  </P> <P> The plunge in heating oil prices marked the first downturn in the February  contract in a week. The selloff was largely a reaction to spring like weather  in much of the northern United States, especially the populous Northeast, where  record-breaking cold in December had spurred strong demand for heating oil and  pushed prices up sharply.  </P></p>

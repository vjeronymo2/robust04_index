			<p><P> January 10, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LEARNING TO READ  </P> <P> It is very annoying to know that illiteracy has become an accumulated problem  in the United States.  </P> <P> Possibly, literacy centers could be made to help assist people in learning. Or,  with all of the different teaching aids for literate people, maybe these same  companies could make teaching aids for the illiterate. The libraries could  offer free classes to develop reading and writing skills. Correctional  facilities should automatically make prisoners attend classes.  </P> <P> RANDY RETTIG  </P> <P> Dana Point  </P></p>

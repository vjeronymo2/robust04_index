			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / Local politics drains Nigeria's oil: Violence, sabotage and leaks in the country's oil-rich south-east Oil spurts out of a broken pipeline and seeps into the tropical bush of the Niger delta. There is not an oil worker within 10 miles to stop it. It is the latest spillage at Ebubu, 30 miles east of Port Harcourt, one of 62 oil fields operated by Shell in south-eastern Nigeria. According to the local Ogoni people, there have been several other oil spills on their land since November from the exposed pipes which snake along roads and past houses in the Ogoni's area of Rivers state. In January, they say, a gas leak at Kpor led to a fire in which a villager was badly burnt. At another site at Ebubu, about 2 1/2 acres of land has been caked in oil since a blow-out in the 1970s and in the rainy season it pollutes one of the streams which are the main source of fresh water in the area. A joint venture in the area between the Nigerian government, which owns 55 per cent, Shell (30 per cent), Elf (10 per cent) and Agip (5 per cent) produces half of Nigeria's 2m barrels a day of oil. All Shell's oil fields in Ogoni, which used to produce 28,000 barrels a day, have been closed and some of the flow stations have been vandalised since mid-1993 when Shell withdrew its staff and contractors from the area in the face of rising hostility from local communities. Shell claims that 60 per cent of the spills in Ogoni in 1992 were 'the direct result of sabotage made to claim compensation'. Militant leaders in the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (Mosop) say that since Shell started Nigeria's oil industry on their land more than 30 years ago, the company has damaged the environment and neglected the communities. They also blame Shell for interventions by the security forces which have led to civilian deaths over the past 12 months. The oil companies in Nigeria estimate that they lost production and equipment worth Dollars 200m last year as a result of community disputes. Last year Shell alone recorded 168 incidents affecting production, lost 1,400 project days and deferred production of 14m barrels of oil. The joint venture is spending more than Dollars 20m this year on helping the oil area communities with agricultural extension, scholarships and basic infrastructure such as schools, hospitals, drinking water and roads. As the military government tries to launch its constitutional conference, the minority tribes in the oil-rich delta are trying to wrest control of the oil wealth from the central government, traditionally dominated by northern Nigerians, and from the commercial centre of Lagos. The Ogoni are one of many groups in a rising wave of protest and disorder across the Niger delta which threatens the security of the staff and equipment of the multinational oil companies which produce 95 per cent of Nigeria's exports. This oil wealth is in striking contrast to the condition of many of the communities who lack basic amenities. There are almost no environmental laws to control the pollution from the oil industry. In 1992 the government set up the Oil and Minerals Producing Areas Development Commission (Ompadec), with 3 per cent of the revenue and a free hand to provide infrastructure, jobs, education and better environmental standards in the area. Its chairman, Mr Albert Horsfall, says his agency is making a good start but its budget of Dollars 90m a year is inadequate. He estimates that it will take Dollars 4.5bn over five years to meet its target, but such investment looks unrealistic. The government is cutting back its investment in the oil industry, which will depress future production and revenues. At the same time the international donors have suspended aid to Nigeria. Shell plans to stay away from the Ogoni area until the dispute has been settled peacefully, a distant prospect. Since Mr Ken Saro-Wiwa became its leader, Mosop is demanding that Shell by-pass central government, which collects the nation's oil revenue, and pay royalties and rent direct to the half million Ogonis, beginning with Dollars 6bn in back pay. Mr Saro-Wiwa insists on environmental and social impact studies, sponsored by Shell, on the effects of the past 30 years and says the oil companies must raise their standards to those elsewhere in the world. Mosop demands the Ogonis' right to 'self-determination in which they will freely determine their political destiny, use their resources for their own development . . . while contributing to the Nigerian kaleidoscope.' This touches a raw nerve with Nigeria's military rulers, as Nigeria is made up of more than 200 ethnic groups. Mosop claims that the destruction of the village of Kaa on Ogoni's southern border last August, which left hundreds homeless or dead or homeless, was the work of security forces. An Ogoni council chairman has protested to the Rivers state governor over the 'destruction of lives and property of Ogoni people by Nigerian soldiers' in five villages near Afam. Last month Mr Saro-Wiwa was arrested in connection with the murder of four rival Ogoni politicians. The Rivers state commissioner of police has asked for 400 troops to tighten security in the area. US diplomats approaching the area have been turned back. A visiting foreign journalist has been deported. Half Shell Nigeria's 5,000 workforce are employed as security staff at a cost of Dollars 18m a year. Rather than spending more and more on security, the oil companies and the government should try to cure the root causes of the community attacks, argues the company's chairman, Mr Brian Anderson. In January, Nigeria's ministers of oil, internal affairs and trade toured all the oil producing areas of Nigeria and promised a report of their findings.</p>

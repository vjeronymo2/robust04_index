			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / World Trade News: EU puts duties on Japan The European Union said yesterday it had extended the duration of temporary anti-dumping duties of 49.9 to 97 per cent on imports of Japanese television cameras, AP reports from Brussels. The customs duties would take effect on Saturday and last for two months. The prolongation of levies - to allow the EU Commission to complete its investigation of the Japanese imports - was announced in the EU's official journal. The EU defines dumping as selling goods abroad for prices lower than production cost or prices charged in domestic markets.</p>

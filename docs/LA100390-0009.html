			<p><P> October 3, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRUSH IRAQI WAR POWER OR NO DEAL;  </P> <P> GULF: PRESSURES ARE MOUNTING TO MAKE A DEAL WITH SADDAM HUSSEIN THAT LEAVES THE  THREAT TO ISRAEL AND U.S. INTERESTS INTACT.  </P> <P> The real danger in the Persian Gulf crisis is that there will be a phony  settlement because of internal and external pressures on President Bush to  avoid war at any cost.  </P> <P> The pressures are ominously reminiscent of the urgings in Britain and France in  1938 that Adolf Hitler be offered a way out of the 1938 Munich crisis. The  Anglo-French appeasement of Hitler was a fatal mistake then and a deal with the  Iraqi dictator would be equally wrong now.  </P> <P> Any deal will leave untouched the basic threat -- the Iraqi war machine, which  now includes ballistic missiles with chemical nerve-gas warheads and biological  weapons. And Hussein is aggressively seeking nuclear weapons. The only way to  remove this threat to the United States and its allies, including Israel, is to  destroy Iraq's war capability.  </P> <P> The sorts of two-stage settlements being floated in Washington by Secretary of  State James A. Baker III and others are superficially attractive but  unworkable. Stage 1 would be a face-saving Arab deal to pay off Hussein in  traditional Middle Eastern style. He would withdraw from Kuwait in return for  money, oil wells and territory. Stage 2 would be the creation of a Middle East  alliance to contain Hussein, including the United States, Iraq's neighbors and  Egypt.  </P> <P> Hussein would jump at such a deal. Having gambled and lost that he could get  away free with annexing all of Kuwait, he needs to strike the next-best  available deal.  </P> <P> Like Hitler in 1938, Hussein may graciously agree to be paid off with other  countries' resources and territories. He could afford to let a cowed and  compliant Sabah family return to rule Kuwait, just as Syrian President Hafez  Assad leaves obsequious puppets in Lebanon's presidential palace. Hussein's  standing would soar in the Arab world and he would be hailed as the greatest  Muslim leader since Saladin. Then he could select his next victim -- perhaps  Jordan.  </P> <P> To deal with this danger, the State Department proposes a regional security  organization based on a long-term U.S. military presence and American-Arab  cooperation and burden-sharing. On paper, such an arrangement seems ideal. But  to credibly contain Iraq's untouched and growing power, the organization would  have to include Iran and Syria. It is hard to believe that they would join.  Even if they did, U.S. public opinion would have a hard time accepting them as  allies and Congress would never approve arming them. Assad is, after all, a  Junior League version of Hussein.  </P> <P> Second, while a long-term, major U.S. military commitment to the region would  be necessary, it would be counterproductive if it involved a large, highly  visible American presence. British and Soviet experience in the Middle East  shows that the visible presence of what Arabs see as infidels attracts intense  nationalist and religious hostility and delegitimizes the host governments.  Hussein, like Gamal Abdel Nasser in the early 1950s, could turn such Arab  resentment to his advantage, consolidating his role as the hero of pan-Arabism  and able to use terrorism to deadly effect against U.S. personnel. The United  States and its allies cannot offer Hussein a way out without fatally  compromising their security in the gulf region.  </P> <P> Fortunately, a U.S.-led multinational military offensive could succeed where a  regional security alliance would fail. A military alliance would have a clear,  common objective: the swift destruction of Saddam's war machine. And overall  U.S. leadership, based on its massive military contribution, could coordinate  the diverse British, French and Arab units into an overwhelming force.  </P> <P> The unpalatable truth is that the only effective solution to the threat is the  physical destruction of Hussein's military power. Anything less would mean, as  Winston Churchill warned in 1938, that unchecked aggression will be "the first  foretaste of a bitter cup which will be proffered to us year by year."  </P></p>

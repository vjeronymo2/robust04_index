			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Technology: Europe to lead Warp attack - Sales of early version have beaten US levels European computer users are expected to be in the vanguard of IBM's attack on Microsoft and the Windows operating software. Traditionally, European customers have lagged two years or more behind their US contemporaries, but Hermann Lamberti, head of IBM's personal software division in Europe, says this situation has already been reversed for OS/2, the early version of Warp. In 1992, about 500,000 copies of OS/2 were sold in Europe; in 1993 annual sales were running at more than 1m and this year Mr Lamberti expects to sell more than 2.5m. US customers are expected to buy slightly more than 2m copies in 1994. There seem to be two principal reasons for this. First, while US computer users have tended to adopt each new generation of software in turn, Europeans seem to move in jumps. Lamberti argues that users in countries such as Spain and Portugal, where the PC revolution has been slower to develop than elsewhere in Europe, are moving from a first generation PC to the latest Intel 486 or Pentium based system in one step, and are ready for advanced operating software. Second, Europe is ahead of the US in some of the key networking technologies, including the digital telephony standard Integrated Services Digital Network, and is well-equipped to make use of an advanced network-based operating system. Lamberti expects that the tools built into Warp to gain access to the Internet will appeal particularly to European users. Only about 8-9m European users regularly dial into the Internet compared with 15m or so in the US, but interest has been growing rapidly. The software will have a number of built-in features including simple word processing, database and spreadsheet software for people who make use of only a few of the facilities available in proprietary packages. Lamberti says that nobody should give up a program which suits them in favour of a Warp version, but many users would welcome a simple, built-in alternative. Warp anticipates the demise of the keyboard and mouse by handling speech and pen-based input, but it may be a few years before there is much call for these features. Warp's list price in the UK will be Pounds 70.</p>

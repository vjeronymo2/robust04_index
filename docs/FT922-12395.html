			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / Arts: Unrealised promise of Schnittke's Idiot / Review of the premier of an opera which brings together four remarkable Russians ALFRED Schnittke is the living Russian composer with the widest world following. The honour of mounting his first opera, Life with an Idiot, has gone to the Netherlands Opera at the Muziektheater in Amsterdam, a city with strong Schnittke allegiances. Opening night was undoubtedly a big occasion on the 1992 opera calendar. It was also an evening of powerful exhilaration and disturbance, fascinating and unsatisfying at one go. The age of glasnost is long established, yet there was still something peculiarly affecting about the collaboration of four remarkable Russian artists who only a decade ago were all victims of the Soviet regime. Schnittke himself was long considered a musical dissident; the 1980 novella by Victor Yerofeyev on which the opera is based (and for which Yerofeyev himself wrote the libretto) was a samizdat publication; Boris Pokrovsky, the Moscow veteran responsible for the Amsterdam staging, spent a long period of forced exile in the Russian artistic wilderness; and the sufferings of Mstislav Rostropovich, the conductor, are well known. With foreknowledge of the common factors linking the team, one was bound to scan Life with an Idiot for tokens of political comment, satire, allegory. And in truth, these were not hard to find, especially since Pokrovsky chose to underline them - above all by presenting the Idiot of the title as an obvious Lenin caricature. Yet at a first encounter the whole proved too elusive for any tidy critical response. The ideal audience for this zany farce streaked with angry melancholy would obviously be a metropolitan Russian one directly responsive to the sung words, alert to all the social-protest overtones; even after an advance reading of the libretto, and with occasional help from the Dutch surtitles, the non-Russian-speaking spectator was placed at a considerable disadvantage. Three main characters - the university-lecturer protagonist ('I'), his wife, and Vova the idiot - weave the plot, while the chorus alternately comments on and adds detail to the narrative. For some unspecified offence against the Party, 'I' must undergo the (relatively lenient) punishment of sharing his small apartment with an asylum patient. But Vova turns out to be far from the sweet old man he first seemed. 'Ech]', the single sound he proves capable of uttering, develops into a war cry as in successive stages he wrecks the couple's possessions and their marriage. Having in turn slept with both, he escapes, leaving the wife murdered and 'I' ready for asylum committal himself. Schnittke's and Yerofeyev's echt-Russian brand of comedy is descended from Gogol and, more directly, from Shostakovich's Gogol opera, The Nose. Indeed, Shostakovich's stirring-together of parodied popular numbers and more complex voice-and-chorus combinations provides the key to Schnittke's score. A parallel can also be drawn between Vova's ever-expanding one-word cry, a rich source of amusement throughout the evening, and the vocalise given to the ape dressed as an aristocrat in Henze's Der junge Lord. But in its go-for-broke switches and risk-everything contrasts of musical tone - Old Russian, folk-Russian, joke-Viennese, cod 18th-century, high coloratura sallies for the Wife - the total is pure Schnittke. Many of his most ambitious concert-works have been music-theatre conceptions, in effect if not in name; a full fleshing-out of the theatrical dimension is in many ways an answer to a long-posed Schnittke question. Some typically Schnittkeresque diversions are here included: at one point Rostropovich abandons his baton for the piano part in a tango band, at another he picks up his cello and essays a delicately mournful waltz-meditation. As part of a larger dramatic pattern the jokes come off, brilliantly. The problem is an unevenness of parts. Act 1, bursting with raw vitality, is followed by a second act much more attenuated and less striking in musical invention. How far Schnittke's bad health was responsible it would be impertinent to speculate; but I came away from the first performance longing for the work to be slimmed down, sharpened in focus. Even during Pokrovsky's deliciously picaresque production, with instrument groups disposed on far balconies and choruses marching madly up the theatre aisles, the feeling of huge promise unrealised grew ever greater. This is no criticism of the Amsterdam performance, admirably committed, and least of all of the three Americans leading the cast: the baritone Dale Duesing, tireless as 'I', the soprano Teresa Ringholz, a sweetly appealing Wife, and the tenor Howard Haskin, wonderfully dotty (and quite unrecognisable) as Vova. With all the qualifications already made, I sense that Life with an Idiot is a new opera with a big future. Runs until April 30</p>

			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Brussels to probe BA's takeover of Dan-Air THE European Commission has launched an inquiry into the competitive implications on air services between Belgium and the UK of British Airways' acquisition of Dan-Air, the financially ailing UK-based regional carrier. The unexpected move after an earlier Commission decision not to investigate the takeover is a setback for BA at a time when the UK carrier is seeking to win Washington's approval for its Dollars 750m (Pounds 481m) acquisition of a 44 per cent stake in USAir. The US government is expected to announce a decision on the BA-USAir deal in the next 10 days. BA, which last week also made a bid for a 25 per cent stake in Qantas, the Australian carrier, described the investigation as 'totally unjustified'. Sir Leon Brittan, European Community competition commissioner, announced last month there would be no inquiry into the takeover because Dan-Air's annual turnover was less than Ecu 250m (Pounds 200m), the trigger for an investigation under EC merger regulations. BA, which took over Dan-Air for a nominal Pounds 1 and assumed the airline's liabilities, is now restructuring Dan-Air's operations as part of a new low-cost airline based at London's Gatwick airport. Belgium, however, invoked a special clause never before used in the two-year-old EC merger regulations to prompt an investigation of the deal. Article 22 of the merger regulations allows any member state to request an inquiry into the effects of a merger or takeover on competition on their national territory. The Commission, which has a month to reach an initial verdict, confirmed the inquiry would only assess the impact of the BA takeover on the Belgian market. However, it is now likely to be seized upon by other opponents of the takeover to renew calls for a broader investigation. Virgin Atlantic and British Midland had both unsuccessfully sought an EC inquiry as well as a referral of the deal to the UK Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Air France, which owns a stake in Sabena, the Belgian flag carrier, has also complained to Sir Leon about the decision not to launch a full investigation into the Dan-Air takeover and BA's recent acquisition of a minority stake in TAT, an independent French regional airline. BA yesterday maintained that even a limited inquiry was unjustified because there was already a great deal of competition on the London-Brussels route and scope for expansion.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The regime has continued its brutal oppressive acts  against the Iraqi people, seeking to destroy the marshlands in  southern Iraq. The regime's artillery shelled the regions of  (Bahilah) Nahr Salih, Abu-Saddah, (Muray'an) (al-Mifrakh), and  al-Waki in al-Madinah District in al-Basrah Governorate.    Our sources in southern Iraq said the shelling was so  intense  that scores of houses were destroyed and heavy losses inflicted  on citizens' property. According to the latest information  available to our sources, a 15-year old girl was martyred in the  shelling, which is still continuing.</p>

			<p><P> July 20, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> BID TO HALT DRUG TESTS REJECTED  </P> <P> Superior Court Judge David Yaffe rejected a bid today by a coalition of unions  seeking to suspend a drug-testing program for Los Angeles County job applicants  pending the outcome of a hearing on whether the unions should have a greater  say in the program.  </P> <P> Beginning July 2, the county began requiring applicants to certain jobs to take  the drug tests, including county employees seeking transfers.  </P> <P> The job positions fell into three categories: those in public safety such as  sheriff's deputies, lifeguards and ambulance drivers; equipment operators such  as trash truck drivers, and those whose jobs carried large financial  responsibilities such as lawyers and accountants.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Report by Vadim Stasov: "Defense Industry Breaks the Oath </F> of Silence"]    [Text] Yesterday directors of Petersburg  military-industrial complex [VPK] enterprises discussed the  situation in their sector.    "Enterprise collectives are rapidly moving towards an  economic abyss", "a deliberate destruction of the industry is  underway"--these quotes from the remarks of conference speakers  reflect quite precisely the mood that reigned in the conference  hall of one of the "secret" research institutes.    Directors complained about high electric power rates; about  specialists leaving; about the government not paying for the  output it had placed orders for. A little more of all this, and  the Petersburg VPK will be finished for good.    The discussion culminated in a petition to the president,  the  prime minister, the chairmen of both chambers of the Federation  Council, and the Security Council, prepared by the working group  of the Association of Industrial Enterprises and adopted  unanimously by 138 enterprise directors. Noting that the defense  industry is in a critical condition, directors insist on  holding, no later than the end of March, a special meeting of  the parliament that would discuss the situation in the country,  formulate the goals of socioeconomic reforms being conducted by  the government, and work out a mechanism of officials'  responsibility for carrying out government decisions. Also  adopted (and also unanimously) was the text of the draft for a  presidential edict on the measures of ensuring availability of  finances to pay for state defense orders, which will be sent to  Moscow together with the petition.    Despite these decisions, however, almost all speakers  complained about lack of attention on the part of the  government, which until now has not reacted at all to proposals  and letters of defense industry captains. Having come to the  conclusion that it was useless to rely on Moscow, the directors  decided to look for a way out of the crisis on their own through  joint efforts, and to prepare and adopt within the next few days  a plan of anticrisis measures for Petersburg VPK enterprises.    The directors' hopes that they will finally have the  opportunity to tell the mayor and government representatives  face to face what they think of them, did not get realized. The  government was represented at the conference only by Yuriy  Kozlov, a deputy chairman of the State Committee for Defense  Industry, for whom everything said here was no news. Neither did  the originally planned meeting with Anatoliy Sobchak take place.  The mayor excused himself on the grounds of an extremely busy  schedule, and instead sent his first deputy, Dmitriy Sergeyev.</p>

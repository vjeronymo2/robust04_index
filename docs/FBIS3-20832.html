Nedeljkovic: "Credit Awaiting Deposits"] </F>   [Text] There is no possibility of credit without  significant savings by citizens. Beobanka is the first bank to  offer real estate loans, but few people can pay the high  interest rates. To grant farm loans, Agrobank requires deposits  or share purchases.  <H5>  Strong Dinar -- Expensive Credit </H5>   The expected revival of credit activity is much slower than  expected. Zika Urosevic, chief of the Credit Department in  Agrobank, notes that "there cannot be credit without deposits.  It is true that we are not lending money yet, but we will start  for certain no later than one week from today. However, the  question is who can get credit as long as we require deposits or  share purchases."    In Agrobank, for the time being they only indicate that  their  business policy will also make provisions for loans to farmers,  but only under the previously mentioned condition: cash deposits  or share purchases. For the time being, the possibility of using  the former hard currency savings is not being considered.    Dragoljub Vukosavljevic, president of Union Bank, points out  that "the only person who can get a loan is someone who has  money, but such a person does not need to borrow money. Banks  have no money; thus, more active lending can be expected only  after the revival of savings activity. Still, the question is  how to regain savers' confidence."    Many banks are waiting for their annual meetings to define  their business policies and specify the requirements for credit.  In Privredna Bank in Belgrade, they believe they will regain the  savers' confidence because they have already paid off almost  one-half of the old hard currency savings.    Milovan Kvrgic, director of Privredna Bank in Belgrade, says  that "there is no saving and therefore no credit without savers'  confidence. Objectively observed, banks have no source of money  for lending until saving is revived both in hard currency and in  convertible dinars. What will probably help us is the fact that  we practically never stopped paying off the old hard currency  savings accounts."    The Beobanka Bank has published the requirements for all  types of credit. Particularly important for individuals is the  possibility of real estate loans. However, these loans are  available only to those who can make a deposit equal to 50  percent of the loan value with annual interest of 7 percent.  Loan terms are 20 years for purchase of an apartment and 10  years for home improvements. However, the early figures show  that only a few people will be able to meet the requirements of  either deposit or interest rates, which amount to 1,000 dinars  per month for a two-bedroom apartment of 60 square meters.    The expectation entertained by potential borrowers that  banks  are going to offer a large spectrum of loans is not realistic.  The little money the commercial banks will allocate for loans  will be used very sparingly. No comparison to any previous  period would be realistic. The present situation is considerably  less favorable despite the fact that we have a solid dinar. Some  bankers even say, with a light touch of cynicism, that the dinar  is expensive and difficult to borrow mainly because it is  strong.</p>

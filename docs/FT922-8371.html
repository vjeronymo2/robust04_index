			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Observer: Seal of approval Much play is being made of the government's search for new sources of statistics. But Observer hears that the much-maligned Central Statistical Office has found one satisfied customer - Marks and Spencer. Apparently, Bill McLennan, the Aussie statistician drafted in to rehabilitate the CSO, so impressed Marks and Spencer's top brass on a recent visit, that Britain's leading retailer has agreed to drop its participation in a rival private scheme to collect retail information. M and S reckons McLennan will knock the government's statistics into shape, so there is no point in duplicating efforts and supplying data to the rival project.</p>

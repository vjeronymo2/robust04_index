			<p><P> January 11, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ESTANCIA FIGURES TO TEST TOP-RANKED SADDLEBACK  </P> <P> A tall and talented Saddleback High School basketball team will risk its No. 1  ranking in Orange County at 7:30 tonight when the Roadrunners travel to  Estancia to open Sea View League play.  </P> <P> Saddleback (14-1) is the defending league champion with its only loss coming  against Kennedy, 59-52, in the second round of the Irvine World News  tournament.  </P> <P> Estancia (13-1) lost four times to Saddleback last year. Estancia's only loss  this season was to Irvine, 55-50, in the semifinals of the South Coast  Christmas tournament.  </P> <P> Saddleback is a tenacious rebounding team with good scoring balance. Center  Malru Dottin leads the team with a 15.4-point average, followed by guard Craig  Marshall (15.1) and Tony Agnew (9.6).  </P> <P> Agnew is still recovering from an ankle sprain suffered in the Orange Holiday  tournament and is not expected to play. Sean Simon replaced Agnew and was named  to the all-tournament team at Orange.  </P> <P> Marshall, considered one of the top defensive players in the county, also leads  the team in rebounding with a 7.8 average, followed by Dottin at 7.7.  </P> <P> "I haven't seen anybody pound the boards better than we do," Saddleback Coach  Pat Quinn said. "We're focused on defending our league title, and there's a lot  riding on this first game."  </P> <P> Estancia relies on the shooting of guards Mike Curtis (23.9 points per game)  and Augustin Heredia. (14-point average).  </P> <P> Curtis has made 37 of 68 3-point shots, and Estancia has made 70 of 131 3-point  shots. The Eagles are also shooting 78% at the free-throw line.  </P> <P> "I've scouted Saddleback twice, and they're the best team I've seen in any  phase of the game," Estancia Coach Tim O'Brien said. "My biggest concern is the  physical matchups.  </P> <P> "It's almost a David vs. Goliath situation with their size. I've told our kids  not to miss their shots, because we probably won't get many second attempts."  </P> <P> The best matchup figures to be Marshall against Curtis. Marshall has limited  Mater Dei's Dylan Rigdon to 13 points, Capistrano Valley's Scott McCorkle to 23  points and El Toro's Greg Reynolds to 8 points this season.  </P> <P> "Craig is so worked up about guarding Curtis, I just hope the rest of his game  is all right," Quinn said.  </P></p>

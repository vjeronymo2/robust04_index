			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Survey of Denmark (6): Architect of a new structure - Profile / Peter Zobel, a power in the insurance industry The Danish insurance industry is undergoing a process of recovery after the shocks of 1992, when the country's second largest insurance group, Hafnia, collapsed and the largest group, Baltica, came close to suffering the same fate. The man who has emerged as the architect of the restructuring of the industry is Mr Peter Zobel, chief executive of Codan, a company founded by Mr Zobel's family but in which the UK's Sun Alliance is now the dominant shareholder. Undaunted by the fact that Hafnia was twice the size of Codan, Mr Zobel made a successful bid for Hafnia in March this year, turning Codan into the country's largest accident insurance group (Baltica remains larger in life assurance). A few months later he put his stamp on the industry once more by announcing that premiums throughout the industry were far too low. Codan, he said, would be putting them up by an average of 15 per cent in 1994. The other large companies, several of which had recently promised the public that they were not even dreaming about premium increases, all agreed within days that Mr Zobel was right. They are following Codan's example. For many years Codan has enjoyed the best profitability in the Danish industry, but it was first following the mess which Baltica and Hafnia made of their businesses that Mr Zobel was able to stamp his mark on the industry. Baltica and Hafnia were both brought to their knees by a series of investments which turned out to be unwise and cripplingly expensive. In Hafnia's case, strategic share investments in Baltica itself and Sweden's big insurer, Skandia, caused the problems. When the price of the shares in these two companies collapsed in 1992, Hafnia Holding, the group's parent company, was bankrupted. Property investments were the straws which broke Baltica's back, but while Hafnia Holding was bankrupted and the insurance operations taken over by Codan, Baltica was successfully reconstructed. Its insurance business, which as such has never been in trouble, has continued as before under a new management headed by Mr Hans Eivind Hansen, formerly co-chief executive at Den Danske Bank. Codan's excellent profits record was based on the principle that profits are more important than market shares; it left others to grow poorer by fulfilling their ambitions to become the biggest. Codan led a comfortable existence and its shareholders were well rewarded. 'We didn't have to do it,' said Mr Zobel, reflecting on the acquisition of Hafnia, 'but when you have the money available you have to take the chance. After all, if you don't use the money you have, you might as well shut up shop.' Having bought Hafnia, Codan was not forced to undertake the merger of the two companies, but there were good reasons for undertaking the merger, according to Mr Zobel. There are cost reductions to be made (a staff reduction of about 10 per cent is under way) and the companies have similar customer profiles and strategies, even if there was a profitability gap. The starting point for the two companies was this: in total premium income (life and accident) Codan's was DKr2.1bn to Hafnia's Dkr5.1bn; Codan had 1,069 staff to Hafnia's 2,452; but Codan's equity capital was DKr4.8bn to Hafnia's DKr66m. Together, the assets of the group are about DKr50bn and its market share is 15 per cent in accident business, 21 per cent in industrial insurance (70 per cent in marine and energy), and 12 per cent in life assurance and pension savings. Mr Zobel's aim is to make the two companies into a single business, both inwardly and outwardly, within one year, which means by the summer of 1994, creating a firm in which profitability and financial soundness have priority. Mr Zobel, 57, does not waste words. He speaks in short, crisp sentences, a manner which does nothing to belie his reputation as a tough cookie, who does not suffer fools, let alone incompetent managers, gladly. The deliberation and speed with which he is carrying through the merger only reinforce this reputation. All the main management and personnel were in their new positions in the organisation within four months of the acquisition. In the final months of 1993 the superfluous members of the staff were being identified, conversion of the computer systems was under way, the staff associations (trade unions) were being reorganised to fit the new corporate structure. In the first half of 1994 new products will be introduced, the conversion of the data processing systems is due for completion and increases in premiums will be implemented. The reorganisation may not have been simple, but, says Mr Zobel, it is nothing compared with the difficulty of eliminating the cultural differences and the them-and-us syndrome - 'a hell of a problem,' he says bluntly. Codan is known for a strong team spirit, an image built up over many years, and, says Mr Zobel, not a man to hide his light under a bushel, 'it is to some extent me'. One of the problems which has emerged is that Codan's managers, who have been put into most of the senior positions, have suddenly found themselves running a department which is three times as large as the one they were used to running. 'They have been used to having a finger on everything the department did, and they have yet to realise you can't run a bigger department in the same way,' said an anonymous manager from the Hafnia side of the firm. In the end the success of the acquisition and merger will have to be judged by long-term results. This year has been a reasonably satisfactory year for the insurance companies, which, with bond and share prices rising strongly, made excellent returns on their financial investments, but the substantial 'insurance-technical' losses of recent years have persisted. Mr Zobel is hoping to turn the corner in 1994, when premiums will go up. Some loss of market shares as Codan's profitability is re-established will not disturb him. By 1995, he hopes that the group's results will be satisfactory. The market seems to share Mr Zobel's optimism. Codan's share price was maintained, indeed increased slightly, following the acquisition of the loss-making and impoverished Hafnia and the Codan share remains the most expensive of the insurance shares listed on the Copenhagen Stock Exchange.</p>

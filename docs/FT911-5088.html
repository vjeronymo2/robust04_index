			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / Yugoslav premier claims western support for reforms THE Yugoslav prime minister, Mr Ante Markovic, who is facing growing internal opposition, says he has the support of western governments for his economic reforms and his attempts to hold the country together. Some of the Yugoslav republics, notably Croatia and Serbia, remain determined to topple him and will try to do so again on Friday when Mr Markovic will ask the federal parliament who is for, and against, the reforms. Despite this dark shadow hanging over his future, Mr Markovic remains an optimist. 'We have succeeded in passing through this difficult period. The recent pledge of support - particularly from the US and the EC - means that Yugoslavia now has a greater chance at becoming integrated eventually into Europe,' he said. In a wide-ranging interview in London, where he is attending the inauguration of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, Mr Markovic, prime minister for the past two years ago, said that without western support, the country would disintegrate. 'Such a Yugoslavia is in no western government's interest. For some time, western governments adopted a 'wait and see attitude'. He admitted that his reforms had had little effect over the past year. His attempts to impose a strict monetary policy have been undermined by Serbia which earlier this year printed money to prop up loss-making enterprises. Other republics were imposing higher taxes on enterprises to finance their budgets. Earnings from tourism, which total Dollars 2bn a year, are likely to plummet following a spate of ethnic unrest, the virtual collapse of JAT, the Yugoslav airline, and overpriced hotels and restaurants. Mr Markovic believes that the present struggle waged by some of the republics against the federal government is not about whether Yugoslavia should remain a federation, or a confederation of loose states. 'This comparison is merely a facade. A struggle against the reforms is taking place. It is a struggle for power - and especially totalitarian power, which caused a great setback for the reforms. We are now paying for it.' Mr Markovic believes the reforms are being hampered, not only by nationalism, but by the absence of clearly defined property rights. Last year, he had planned to replace socially-owned property, a nebulous system devised by the late President Tito which placed property outside the hands of the state and individuals. 'The basic conflict now is between those who support and oppose private ownership,' he said. The republic of Croatia, for instance, wants to transfer socially-owned property to the state, while the republic of Serbia is against individual ownership rights. 'The new governments know that if they support private ownership, they will lose their powers. That is why they want to have property in the hands of the state,' he said. The president of the Czechoslovak National Bank, Mr Josef Tosovsky, yesterday appealed to western governments and financial institutions to help the former Comecon countries re-establish trade flows with the Soviet Union. These have fallen steeply since the switch from rouble to dollar trading on January 1, writes Anthony Robinson. 'What I have in mind is for western institutions to make future loans to the Soviet Union conditional on Soviet repayment of east European credits as a means of re-activating trade which, in the Czechoslovak case, has dropped by more than 50 per cent this year,' he said in an interview. The importance of freer access to EC markets was another key issue raised by east Europeans at the opening of the EBRD.</p>

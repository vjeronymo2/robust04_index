			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Swalec in line for cost cutting Swalec, electricity distributor in south Wales, told institutional investors it expected to cut up to Pounds 30m from its Pounds 120m a year distribution costs by 1999/2000 compared with this year. It also said it planned for non-core activities to provide nearly a fifth of group profit before interest and tax by 2000. Celtic Contracting was trading profitably following a small loss and restructuring charges in 1993-4. Swalec was one of three companies which suffered the biggest cut in allowable income as a result of the distribution review, with 17 per cent required from next April.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Kim Yong-sun, a top strategist on South Korean  affairs and a member of North Korean President Kim Il-song's  trusted inner circle, will represent Pyongyang's delegation to  Tuesday's preliminary contact for an inter-Korean summit.    The choice of Kim, concurrently chairman of the  Reunification  Policy Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly, shows how  much importance the North Korean leader places in the  forthcoming summit, South Korean officials said.    North Korean Prime Minister Kang Song-san notified his South  Korean counterpart Yi Yong-tok through a telephone message  Saturday that the influential official will lead a three-member  delegation at the Panmunjom meeting designed to set the date and  venue for the summit.    The other delegates are An Pyong-su, vice chairman of the  Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland, and  Paek Nam-chun, councilor of the Administration Council, it said.    Kim who will take part in his first inter-Korean contact, is  known as an advocate of reform and openness. Moreover, Kim was  the North Korean representative to the first vice ministerial  dialogue with the United States in January 1992, when he met  with then U.S. Under Secretary of State Arnold Kanter. The  meeting, though not substantial, marked the first major sign of  the possibility of normalizing relations between the two  countries. He stepped into the spotlight in September 1990 when  he met with Japanese political patriarch Shin Kanemaru and  produced a joint statement on an early normalization of the  relations between North Korea and Japan.    Kim, who is also secretary for South Korean affairs in the  North Korean Nodong (Workers) Party enjoys strong backing from  President Kim Il-song and his son Chong-il. Kim's closeness to  President Kim has caused the spread of rumors that they are  related by blood. He showed how close his ties are with the  North Korean leader by accompanying Kim on his visit to China  and on other travels from the late 1980s. Kim is said to have  advised Kim Il-song and his heir-apparent Chong-il to introduce  more openness after a tour of Europe in March 1990.    Kim survived factional infighting within the communist party  last year when he was stripped of his post as a candidate for  the Politburo after conservatives criticized liberals'  unfruitful economic reforms.    The two other delegates, in contrast, are seasoned officials  of inter-Korean dialogue who served as delegates to the prime  ministers' talks.    An Pyong-su has a single-track career in dealing with South  Koran affairs. He has worked for the Committee for the Peaceful  Reunification of the Fatherland since he graduated from Kim  Il-song University. He serves as vice chairman of the committee  along with chief delegate Kim Yong-sun. He captivated the South  Korean media as North Korean spokesman for the inter-Korean  prime ministers' talks with his glib tongue.    Meanwhile, Paek Nam-chun also graduated from Kim Il-song  University. He became involved in South Korean affairs as an  advisor to the North Korea Red Cross Society during inter-Korean  dialogue back in 1972. Except for a brief stint as ambassador to  Poland, Paek has served as a point man in North Korea's contacts  with South Korea.</p>

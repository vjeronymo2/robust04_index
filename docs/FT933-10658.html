			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / Arts: Beautiful Thing - Theatre When people ask 'But where are the new plays?', there are several different kinds of answer to give. But as good a reply as any is simply to say 'Try the Bush.' The Bush Theatre, above the Bush Pub on the corner of Shepherds Bush Green, has been in the forefront of presenting new drama for years now. There are other places - eg the Royal Court  - whose new plays may be more innovative in sheer writing and structure; but at the Bush (thanks to its artistic director Dominic Dromgoole) there is a real house style, and a real alertness to the way people live today. Play upon play there seems to be tapped right into the way things are, and audiences lap up each show. Watching Jonathan Harvey's new play, Beautiful Thing, you can feel how easily its audience follows every current and allusion. Its action occurs in a modern block of tiny flats in South East London, and - like several recent Bush plays - it is mainly about adolescence. In particular, Beautiful Thing is a story of homosexual love between two teenage boys in next-door flats, but its most touching achievement is the gradual, oblique, funny, rounded way that it leads up to this. These boys are just the youngest of the play's five characters. What happens between them is affecting because you have come to know them in context. Jamie lives with his mother, Sandra, a barmaid currently dating Tony, the latest in a line of boyfriends. Ste (the boy next door) lives with his brother and their violent father, who frequently beats him. Jamie's other next-door neighbour, Leah, is another teenager who leads a life of cheerful boredom only lit up by her obsession with the life and songs of the late Mama Cass. The walls are like paper. The play catches, very surely, the numerous tolerances and intolerances that are the fabric of daily life on any housing estate. Jamie and Ste, who are the only characters who seem fully rounded from the very start here, are excellently played by Mark Letheren and Jonny Lee Miller. Body language, mastery of accent, facial expressions: all these are used with such psychological accuracy that you hang on every tiny event as if it were part of a thriller. (Just watch how often both boys avoid looking each other straight in the eye in Act One; and how naturally they do so in Act Two.) There are weaknesses. The ending, charmingly sentimental, is too rose-tinted. There could be yet more tension - and, later, more release - between Jamie and his mother Sandra (Patricia Kerrigan); their big fight is too obviously choreographed. Both Sandra and Leah look at first like comedy-cartoon 'types' (sassy, quarrelsome, outspoken cockneys),but it is part of Harvey's skill - part of his point - is that they turn out to be as complex and troubled as Jamie and Ste. Interestingly, Kerrigan's acting gets more relaxed as her part grows larger; but Sophie Stanton, who acts Leah exactly as she acted in the Bush's last play, cannot handle the element of despairing escapism that becomes more startling as the play progresses. But the director, Hettie Macdonald, has brought out so much truth from Harvey's play that any passing flaws are but shadows. Like most of those about me, I followed the action with my heart in my throat - and, while applauding, blinked back the odd tear.</p>

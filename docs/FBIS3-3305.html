This is the first official announcement since Xi  Yang was arrested and charged nearly six months ago where the  authorities have disclosed that Xi Yang is being tried and that  his case will be concluded soon.    Zeng Decheng, a Hong Kong deputy to the NPC, said last night  that yesterday afternoon, the NPC Secretariat arranged a meeting  between Supreme Court Vice President Zhu Mingshan and NPC  deputies from Hong Kong.    Zeng Decheng quoted Zhu Mingshan as saying: Xi Yang is now  on trial at the Beijing Municipal Intermediate People's Court on  the charge of stealing state secrets. Since Tian Ye, vice  director of the General Office of the Foreign Affairs Bureau of  the People's Bank of China and high-level state secrets are  involved in the case, the hearing is not open to the public, and  Xi Yang is not allowed to see his family or a representative of  his employer.    Zhu Mingshan said: The Beijing Municipal People's  Procuratorate Branch lodged an indictment on 14 December 1993  against Xi Yang in the Beijing Municipal Intermediate People's  Court. On 22 December, the court held a closed-door trial of Xi  Yang. On 27 January this year, the Beijing Municipal  Intermediate People's Court returned the case to the Beijing  Municipal People's Procuratorate Branch, requesting additional  information. According to PRC "Criminal Proceedings," the  procuratorate must supply the requested information within one  month. On 22 February this year, the Beijing Municipal People's  Procuratorate Branch supplied the Beijing Municipal Intermediate  People's Court with the additional information and the trial  resumed.    Zeng Decheng said that according to the provisions, the  court  hearing should only last one month, and, in any case, no more  than one and a half months. Therefore, Xi Yang's case will be  concluded at the end of this month or by early April at the  latest.    Zeng Decheng said: When Hong Kong NPC deputies inquired of  Zhu Mingshan about proof of evidence in Xi Yang's case, Zhu  Mingshan said the establishment of a case did not require  harmful effects of a criminal act; the intention to do such harm  would suffice. He termed it criminal intention.    Zhu Mingshan further claimed that there is a written record  which shows Xi Yang declined to hire a lawyer. He also said Xi  Yang had met his family earlier. Zeng Decheng said that so far  there was no evidence to show that Xi Yang had been denied his  due rights, and Hong Kong NPC deputies handed Zhu Mingshan a  letter from the Hong Kong Journalists Association requesting  lenient treatment to Xi Yang. He emphasized that as a Hong Kong  NPC deputy, he hoped the mainland authorities would try Xi  Yang's case strictly in accordance with the due process of law,  saying that the fairness of the trial depends on the final  verdict.    On the other hand, CPPCC delegate Xu Simin yesterday quoted  a  personal friend of his from the PRC Ministry of Justice as  saying the week previously: Xi Yang went through his first  trial hearing in the middle of last month and sentence is  expected any time soon. Initial signs indicate that Xi Yang will  receive a suspended jail term of one to two years, and he can  return to Hong Kong shortly afterward with a bond provided by  his family or his employer.    Xu Ximing qouted concerned personnel as saying that during  the trial Yang was found to have broken Chinese law. However,  since he made the mistake while covering events and not in the  context of any intelligence work, Xu would very likely receive a  light sentence. Xu Ximing said that if Xi Yang received a heavy  sentence, he would appeal to the Higher People's Court and  request permission to be present at the appeal hearing.    CPPCC delegate Luo Hsiang-kuo also said during the session  that he had, in a personal capacity, announced to the conference  this Tuesday that he hoped the Ministry of Justice would treat  Xi Yang with leniency and would reveal details of the whole  matter to the public. He said he would try to bring up the  matter in a panel discussion. However, the conference did not  allow him to discuss this matter at the panel meeting for the  reason that this was an individual matter.    A MING PAO spokesman said that he did not know about the  latest developments in Xi Yang's trial. MING PAO would contact  the departments concerned today to get updates on the situation.  The spokesman reiterated his hope that the Chinese authorities  would treat Xi Yang with leniency.</p>

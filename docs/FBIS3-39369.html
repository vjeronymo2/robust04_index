			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] A commentary by political analyst Alain  Duhamel in the 4 February Paris daily LIBERATION focuses on the  rise of a new political personality on the Left, which he terms  the "Aubry phenomenon." The "fairly spectacular" emergence of  former Minister of Labor Martine Aubry, daughter of EC  Commission President Jacques Delors, proves that the socialist  label has ceased to be a handicap in the public's view, Duhamel  contends. In fact, a SOFRES/FIGARO MAGAZINE February poll showed  that Aubry's popularity jumped 10 percentage points, placing her  fourth after Delors, former Minister of Culture Jack Lang and PS  leader Michel Rocard, but ahead of well-known PS officials such  as Lionel Jospin, Pierre Mauroy, and Laurent Fabius. Additional  proof that the PS is not quite "condemned to electoral  banishment" as was believed not too long ago was furnished by  some respectable scores in the last legislative by-elections,  Duhamel continues. While Aubry's popularity is undoubtedly due  to the publication of her recent book--praised by critics and  the press--and her appearance on a television program that  highlighted "her natural authority, clarity of expression and  intellectual agility," her "energy, intelligence, independence,  and vivacity" are beginning to be well-known.    Nonetheless, Aubry's popularity does not stem solely from  her  personal attributes, Duhamel contends. It also reflects Rocard's  present "political stagnation" and the convergence between  Aubry's political image and the emerging social demands related  to the "phantom of unemployment and the nightmare of exclusion  haunting the French" that both the Left and the Right have  failed to curb. It is well known that Aubry has made these  issues her "obsession and specialty," Duhamel writes. Moreover,  the French, "traumatized by the crisis and disappointed by  political parties" are turning away from ideological and  partisan politics. Aubry, who has kept her distance from parties  and the politicians, only arrived on the scene three years ago  and is untainted by the political maneuvering characterizing her  fellow politicians. Finally, she also enjoys the advantage of  being a woman in a field of men, presently the most popular in  France with the exception of Minister of Social Affairs Simone  Veil, Duhamel concludes.</p>

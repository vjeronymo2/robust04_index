			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Chon Yuk, CHUNGANG ILBO managing editor: "Are </F> State Secrets Protected Properly?"]    [Text] Every power struggle or international competition  involves a fierce intelligence war. Therefore, how a state or  organization steals or protects secrets demonstrates its overall  management ability. And it often serves as a key factor  determining victory or defeat.    In the Sixth Republic era, President No Tae-u and Kim  Yong-sam, then chairman of the Democratic Liberal Party [DLP],  frequently waged such war against each other. The first  confrontation came in about April 1990, shortly after the  three-party merger. At the time, Pak Chol-on, then minister of  state, who was wielding real power as President No's virtual  alter ego, fired the first shot with his remark: "If I open my  mouth ...." Kim Yong-sam responded by facing President No at  Chongwadae over a Manila envelope he carried with him. Taking  out a document from the envelope, he said to the president,  "Such covert operations against me...! I might as well take to  the streets and die at the hands of people, but not at your and  your men's hands."    The document he pulled out was a top-secret plan concerning  a  so-called operation to incapacitate YS [Kim Yong-sam], which  President No had been briefed about by So Tong-kwon, director of  the Agency for National Security Planning [NSP], a few days  earlier and which he asked his chief secretary, No Chae-pong, to  study. The president was so shocked that he sent for his  physician following YS's departure. NSP Director So lost face  with the president and No Chae-pong, the chief secretary, came  under a secret NSP investigation. Chongwadae staff would recall  that the incident made President No realize, with fear, YS's  terrible destructive power for the first time.    In another round, YS found himself the loser. In the summer  of 1991, he went to Cheju, ostensibly on vacation. While there,  he staged, in part openly, a demonstration demanding an early  nomination by the president for him as the DLP's presidential  candidate. President No had repeatedly cautioned YS to refrain  from raising issues relating to a political agenda as the  president still had 19 months to serve. And this defiance by YS  infuriated the president.    President No called in YS, who had just returned from Cheju,  to show him a document--a list of campaign pledges prepared by a  research institute run by YS' close aide. The list began with "I  will thoroughly liquidate the military culture."    "Do you think that you should be allowed to do things like  this already?" President No demanded. The revelation enraged YS.  He summoned the aide and told him to "get lost--to America or  wherever."    There was a time YS implicitly showed off his information  gathering power to President No. In about September 1991, when  Chongwadae and the NSP were unaware of opposition merger  negotiations under way between Kim Tae-chung and Yi Ki-taek, the  president heard for the first time what was going on from YS at  one of their weekly meetings. The result was that the president  took action against the NSP officials concerned, censuring them  for the blunder. "No one knows better about Kim Tae-chung than I  do," said YS to the president, with evident pride.    Leaks of secrets in the Sixth Republic were so bad that  people called the Administration a "water-like government."  Former President Chon Tu-hwan, then in exile at Paektamsa, a  Buddhist temple, was fully aware of visible and invisible  pressures which Chongwadae and the NSP were then applying on him.    A typical case was the "Lake Leman plan" designed to banish  Mr. Chon overseas against his wishes to return to his Yonhuidong  home. Upon discovering the plan, Mr. Chon, taking it as the last  straw, phoned to President No protesting vehemently. He also  kept a recording of the telephone conversation.    Espionage war like this waged between the present and former  state leaders shows how easily core secrets and information of  the government can be leaked in a climate that mixes up public  and private interests. At the same time, it raises concern over  the fact that our state secrets are being utilized more as tool  of internal power struggle than for national security, because  the loophole can lead to leaks of national security secrets.    Chongwadae is said to be extremely sensitive to security  these days in the wake of a secret visit to Korea of James  Woolsey, director of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA),  which was exposed by press photos. There was also a case of a  Korean military officer on active duty leaking military secrets  to a Japanese correspondent. In yet another case, information on  a top-secret strategic process in the North-South dialogue was  exposed by an opposition assemblyman. Chongwadae's concern over  the continued divulgences is understandable.    It is a matter of course that each nation has its secrets  that, for the sake of protecting and preserving its security and  interests, cannot be divulged to others. Especially in advanced  countries, national security and diplomatic secrets,  confidential internal memos and personnel regulations of  administrative organizations, and business and personal secrets  are strictly excluded from the objects of the freedom of  information by law. At the same time, there are established  criteria governing what are state secrets and who should protect  them, as well as the balance of the freedom of information and  that of speech.    In comparison, Korea seems to have many problems with its  management of state secrets, in principle and in ability.  Deplorable indeed are abuses of such secrets for the mere  convenience of the ruler, the slack discipline and the lack of  ethical standards in this country, as seen in the Sixth Republic  case of a Chongwadae senior presidential secretary for  diplomatic and security affairs--a symbol of national security  itself--who could easily seek asylum overseas.    If the present civilian government can restore the control  of  state secrets to where it belongs by correcting the flaws and  disorder of the Sixth Republic, and without curtailing the  people's right to know, the accomplishment will by itself save  the regime from criticism of "incompetency."    It can be said that the teaching of Han Feizi that "plans  succeed when secrets are kept, conspiracies fail when secrets  leak" is a wise saying touching at the cardinal point of  information control capability.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Supreme Court confirmed this officially in  Conakry last night: Outgoing President Lansana Conte has indeed  been re-elected as early as the first round of the presidential  elections, which took place last month. The opposition, which  claimed to have won or at least enough to get a second round,  has not convinced the judges. Nicolas Balique reports:    [Balique] The outgoing president received 51.70 percent of  the votes, while his main rival, Alpha Conde, got 19.55 percent.  Ba Mamadou and Siradiou Diallo each received 13 and 12 percent,  respectively. Among the other four candidates on the lists,  only Facine Toure gets more than 1 percent. The opposition's  appeals, which denounced manipulations and massive rigging, have  been rejected.    However, the Supreme Court has accepted President Conte's  request: It cancelled the results in Kankan and confirmed the  invalidation of Siguiri, two departments of High Guinea where  Alpha Conde received many votes. The opposition has recalled  that without this decision, President Conde would have had to  stand again. The next stage of the democratization process is  the legislative elections. The date has not been set yet, but  according to the Guinean electoral code, it is to be published  70 days before the poll. Nicolas Balique, Dakar, RFI.    Lamine Sidime, the first president of the Supreme Court in  Conakry, is satisfied with the way the elections took place. He  spoke to Serge Daniel:    [Begin recording] [Sidime] I would also like to emphasize  the  joy and the cheerfulness with which the citizens of this country  went to ballot boxes. They did so with true cheerfulness,  notwithstanding, of course, damaged ballot boxes and equipment  here and there. With a 78 percent turnout, I think that it is a  record, and it is encouraging for democracy in Africa. [end  recording]</p>

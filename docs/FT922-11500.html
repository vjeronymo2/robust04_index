			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / Money Markets: Interbank rates up THE announcement of Germany's higher than expected money supply figures dampened expectations of a cut in interest rates on the UK money markets, causing rates to rise marginally. Interbank rates ended the day a touch higher. The three-month rate, a key indicator of future base rate movements, stood at 10 9/16 - 7/16 per cent after ending yesterday at 10 1/2 - 7/16 per cent. Short sterling futures finished a fraction lower, implying expectations of higher interest rates. The June short sterling contract ended at 89.63 after opening at 89.80. Yesterday's closing figure indicates an implied interest rate of 10.37 per cent. In the discount market, attention focused upon the overnight rate after the Bank of England again forecast a liquidity shortage of around Pounds 1.15bn. In the morning, the rate touched 11 per cent and subsequently stuck to around 10 3/4 - 5/8 per cent, as the market spurned the Bank's help at that stage. In later trading, however, the market mounted a concerted effort to dispose of the shortage. The Bank purchased bills totalling Pounds 1.107bn, of which Pounds 707m were outright Band-1 bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent and Pounds 400m for resale to the market in equal amounts on May 11 and 12 at an interest rate of 10 7/16 per cent. In the afternoon session, the Bank purchased a further Pounds 40m of Band-1 bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent. Trading in the discount market remained quiet, however. Few operators believe that the Bank of England wants to ease interest rates, in spite of sterling's gains on foreign exchange markets this week. 'The Treasury and the Bank of England would like to see further gains in the sterling exchange rate before they signal a cut,' said one market analyst yesterday. German call money was quoted slightly below Thursday's levels, with sufficient funds in the market to allow rates to ease away from the 9.75 per cent Lombard rate. Overnight funds changed hands at 9.60/70 per cent, with most trading taking place at 9.65 per cent. The market quietened after worries that liquidity would be in short supply after the Bundesbank had drained DM1.9bn from the market in this week's securities repurchase tender.</p>

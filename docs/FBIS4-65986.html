			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Patrice-Henry Desaubliaux: "Balladur Presents </F> Military Programming Law"]    [Text] Drawn up by Defense Minister Francois Leotard, the  Military Programming Law could first and foremost be entitled  "the Balladur law." It was the prime minister who, when he took  office at the end of March 1993, decided to make the law,  together with the defense white paper, one of his government's  priorities. Moreover, he did it even though certain members of  his majority were suggesting he should wait until the next  presidential election in 1995. It was Edouard Balladur who  determine the main policy directions to be taken by this law.  Above all, it was he who made three important decisions: the  financial decision to increase investment spending in the  defense sector by 0.5 percent per year (and by 1.5 percent as of  1998, if the economic situation permits), despite the law  limiting public spending; the advance decision not to tie the  hands of the next president where nuclear defense is concerned;  and the decision for a "mixed" army which retains the principle  of conscription while increasing the size of the professional  forces.  <H5>  Role of Deterrent </H5>   Since he bears the ultimate responsibility, Edouard Balladur  insisted on being the first to speak in yesterday afternoon's  debate in the National Assembly. He told the deputies that  above and beyond the budgetary aspects of this Programming Law  for 1995-2000 were the "major stakes" and an "ambition": "the  role and place of France in the world." The prime minister  explained: "It is the government's duty to give our defense  policy the priority it deserves. As General de Gaulle stated on  14 June 1952, `the defense of France is the state's main reason  for being.'"    Mr. Balladur stressed: "Who can forget that today, for the  first time in 50 years, French soldiers are active in fighting  in Europe itself? The world has lost its traditional points of  reference since the collapse of the Berlin Wall, and we have  entered a period of uncertainty." As a result, it was necessary  "to put a stop to a situation that is unprecedented in the Fifth  Republic" where, for the last three years, France has not had a  multiyear defense plan. "We have now marked a decisive turning  point." It was therefore necessary to increase the military  equipment budget without, however, "abandoning budget austerity."    With regard to deterrence, the prime minister reiterated:  "The government will take all the measures necessary for our  deterrent to preserve its key role in our defense strategy. The  Military Programming Law will provide the state with the means  of maintaining the credibility of our nuclear arsenal in the  future. Our nuclear forces will be maintained at the level  necessary to ensure the protection of our vital interests. A  major, unprecedented effort will be made in the area of  simulation and prototypes to prepare for the decisions that will  have to be made in the coming years concerning the  specifications of future weapons. Remember that France is not  under any international constraints. I can assure you that this  freedom of choice will be preserved." He left no room for  doubt, even though he did not explicitly mention the issue of  nuclear testing. On this issue, Francois Leotard later said:  "Investment credits have been earmarked so that a resumption of  nuclear testing can resume as soon as the order is given."    Will this double government statement calm people like  Jacques Baumel, who wanted to amend the law to allow a  resumption of nuclear testing? These people would like to  respond to the president of the Republic, who not only is  resolved not to restart nuclear testing right up to the end of  his term, but who also "does not envision" such a decision being  made by his successors. They would doubtless also like to see a  more acrimonious period of cohabitation. Everyone, it seems, in  the government and in the majority, has adopted Francois  Leotard's point of view that the issue is not whether tests will  recommence, but when.    In his speech, Edouard Balladur also insisted on what is,  through the white paper and the programming law, "a major  development in our defense policy, namely, our European  commitment." Our defense force, guaranteeing the independence  and sovereignty of our country, "is also at the disposal of  Europe." The law will give France "the means of playing a full  role in the emergence of a European defense policy, while  remaining wholly aware that this will only be a gradual process  and will not become a reality until our partners combine their  forces with ours."    The role of France in European security is another issue,  quite separate from the debate on the programming law.  Yesterday morning, opening a seminar organized by Senator  Pierre-Christian Taittinger, a former minister, on "The Atlantic  Alliance and European Security," Francois Leotard called for a  change in the Alliance's military organization, to enable "the  major commands have a disproportionate influence on planning and  decisionmaking." The defense minister argued that the grouping  of multinational armed forces was "a significant step," adding  that Europe should "be seen as an independent political and  military force."    Nonetheless, it has been a struggle to get the famous Common  Foreign and Security Policy off the ground. To inject a bit of  dynamism, Pierre Lellouche, (RPR [Rally for the Republic])  deputy for the Val-d'Oise department), speaking on behalf of the  National Assembly's European Community delegation, yesterday  also made two proposals: the setting up of a European Security  Council (open just to those states that want to contribute to  the defense of the European Union) and the creation of a  European rapid intervention force of 120,000 men from the five  main European partner states. The European defense system would  then be based on a structure of "variable geometry."</p>

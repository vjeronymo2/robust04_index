			<p>BFN     [Text] For the second time during the current seventh  mandate of the local People's Government bodies, the process of  having delegates present a progress report to their voters will  take place in the nation's more than 13,800 electoral districts,  during the months of May and June. This seventh mandate began on  10 January 1993, when the Municipal Assemblies of the People's  Government were installed.    Days back, the president of Cuba's parliament, Ricardo  Alarcon de Quesada, sent a letter to these delegates. The text  of this letter explains that this process is spread over a  two-month period because of the experience of the preceding  year. This will make it possible to schedule meetings in such a  way as to permit attendance by the greatest possible number of  cadres and officials of the administrative bodies of each place,  as well as by delegates to the Provincial Assemblies and by  deputies elected by those districts.    Alarcon's letter adds that this new progress report process  has been conceived as a continuation of the effort increasingly  to improve the method of tightening relations between delegates  and their voters, and so as to explain the need to provide  concrete and essential operational information to the people on  the current situation and how to face it. Alarcon also calls for  the people's participation in the effort to face the current  situation and to support the measures that may be adopted in the  quest for solutions.    Alarcon's letter concludes by saying that the meetings will  follow the special sessions of the National Assembly of the  People's Government [ANPP] and that we must do everything  possible so that these meetings will help enhance the people's  understanding of the need to take the necessary steps to  streamline internal finances and to promote economic efficiency.    Everything seems to indicate that delegates and deputies  from  each municipality and province will have the appropriate  scenario to promote these contacts with the voters of each  district so that the progress reports will no longer be the  classic rendering of accounts, which are often mechanical and  tiresome, but a collective action of exchange of opinions,  explanations, arguments, and information about the solutions  found for current problems, and so as to resume the talks on  agreements and declarations by the ANPP in its 1 and 2 May  sessions.    The people in general will be able to support once again the  announced proposals for internal economic and financial  adjustment measures conceived as the most important steps taken  over the past few years to maintain this process of social  equity.</p>

			<p><P> November 18, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COMPUTER FIRM REPORTS LOSING $6 MILLION IN YEAR  </P> <P> Computer Automation Inc. said Friday it lost $6 million in the fiscal year  ended June 30, and the firm's chairman said the losses "have seriously affected  the company's cash flow."  </P> <P> The company, which manufactures automatic test equipment and minicomputers,  said it also expects to report a loss for the first quarter of fiscal 1990,  which ended Sept. 30. Computer Automation was late in reporting its year-end  financial figures, but said results for the first quarter will be released  shortly.  </P> <P> The firm, which has been in financial straits for the past two years, said its  revenue for fiscal 1989 fell to $6.4 million, down 10.6% from $7.1 million a  year earlier. The loss for the recent year compares with a $1.3 million loss in  the prior year.  </P> <P> Computer Automation's efforts to raise badly needed cash were dealt a blow  recently when a deal to sell its automatic test business to Technology  Marketing Inc. of Irvine for $4.1 million fell through.  </P></p>

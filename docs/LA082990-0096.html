			<p><P> August 29, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> MOODIES ENGAGING, WITH A LITTLE HELP  </P> <P> A petition was circulating in the audience at the Universal Amphitheatre on  Monday calling for the induction of headliners the Moody Blues into the Rock  and Roll Hall of Fame. The initiative raises the question of whether the  25-year-old British group, whose embellishment of rock with orchestral  flourishes spawned a generation of art-rockers, deserves a place next to  undeniably influential countrymen like the Rolling Stones, the Who and the  Kinks.  </P> <P> The jury is still out.  </P> <P> Though such '60s classics as the urgent "Go Now!" (which the current group  seems to disavow) and the ornately orchestrated "Nights in White Satin" were  immensely influential in their time, the days of a future may have passed for  the group. Though they engineered an impressive commercial comeback in the  '80s, the vitality of their music has faded.  </P> <P> While the group presented a remarkably engaging show on Monday, it could not  have done so without two backup singers and what appeared to be taped vocals  augmenting the frayed voices of the lead trio: Justin Hayward, Ray Thomas and  John Lodge.  </P> <P> Only "Your Wildest Dreams" among the newer songs approached the ambition and  appeal of set staples like "Question" and "Tuesday Afternoon." The relatively  recent "I Know You're Out There Somewhere," a deliciously tuneful  crowd-pleaser, is a bit too much of a confection to be included in the ranks of  Moody music that matters.  </P> <P> If the Moodies are truly serious about earning a place in the Hall of Fame  before such fellow shutouts as Bob Marley and Del Shannon, their case could be  helped considerably with a new album worthy of their best work.  </P> <P> Ready for immediate induction into the Hall of Shame is opening act Darling  Cruel, a bombastic, thunderingly bad ensemble. The L.A. outfit assaulted those  who dared to stay in their seats with an arsenal of transparently rendered  Bowie mannerisms and inept heavy-metal posturing.  </P> <P> The Moody Blues will also be at the Pacific Amphitheatre in Costa Mesa on  Thursday, San Diego's Open Air Theatre on Friday and the Santa Barbara County  Bowl on Monday.

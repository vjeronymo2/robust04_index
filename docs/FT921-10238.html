			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Asil Nadir fails to get civil action suspended MR ASIL Nadir, former chairman of Polly Peck International, the fresh fruit and electronics conglomerate which went into administration in October 1991, yesterday failed in the High Court to get a Pounds 378m civil action suspended while he faces criminal charges. The action was launched in October against Mr Nadir and six other defendants by Mr Christopher Morris, of Touche Ross, one of Polly Peck's three administrators. Mr Justice Knox rejected the claim that Mr Nadir might risk prejudicing his defence in the criminal action by giving evidence in the civil case, but he ordered that future hearings in which Mr Nadir is involved should be heard in camera until the criminal case comes to trial. He also asked for the plaintiff of the civil action to given undertakings for Mr Nadir's protection. The civil case is unlikely to come to trial before the criminal action is heard in the Crown Court, at a date expected to be after January of next year, Mr Justice Knox said. The plaintiff may not divulge information received in evidence from Mr Nadir to third parties, though it can be passed to the other Polly Peck administrators, Mr Michael Jordan, of Cork Gulley, and Mr Richard Stone, of Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte - provided they respect its confidentiality. Meanwhile, it has emerged that Mr Nadir recently lost his home at Alford Street in the West End of London because of the bankruptcy action against him and has moved to a relative's home. He is due to appear at Bow Street Magistrates' court on Tuesday on 72 theft charges and four of false accounting, involving Pounds 155m of company funds, when it is expected that arrangements to transfer his case to the crown court will be announced. Mr Nadir also faces proceedings in the High Court on February 24 from his personal creditors. They are seeking to have him committed to prison for contempt of court by breaking his undertakings to them.</p>

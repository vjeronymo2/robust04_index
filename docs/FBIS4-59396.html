			<p>BFN     [Text] At the Royal Hashemite Court today, His Majesty  King Husayn received Yemen's Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim  Basindwah, who communicated a verbal message from President 'Ali  'Abdallah Salih. The message thanks his majesty for his  attitude toward sisterly Yemen, and outlines the latest  developments there.    His Majesty King Husayn told Basindwah that Jordan wants to  see the Yemeni people stay united, within a single entity.  Jordan is anxious for the gains achieved by the Yemeni people  to be preserved. His majesty told the envoy the flow of Yemeni  blood should be stemmed and outside intervention in the  country's domestic affairs kept at bay. Jordan, his majesty  added, is prepared to extend humanitarian aid to Yemen whenever  the need arises.    The meeting was attended by Royal Court Chief al-Sharif Zayd  Bin-Shakir; his majesty's adviser Khalid al-Karaki; Talal  al-Hasan, minister of state for foreign affairs; and the Yemeni  ambassador in Amman.    The Yemeni minister left Amman this afternoon and was seen  off at the airport by Talal al-Hasan.</p>

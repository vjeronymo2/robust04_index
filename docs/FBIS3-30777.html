In the pages of the  weeklies ROMANIA MARE and POLITICA, the defense minister  together with other officers of the Romanian Army, are described  and called names in the most aberrant possible manner.    The PRM senator's saraband of curses and slander has a very  banal cause: Every available means must be taken to promote his  brother, that is, Colonel Marcu Tudor, to the rank of general  because that is what Corneliu Vadim Tudor wants.    General Niculae Spiroiu considers the request of the PMR  senator as aberrant. Because he dared to defy Vadim, the  minister of defense became the mocking subject of the ROMANIA  MARE and POLITICA magazines.    After a letter addressed to Oliviu Gherman, the president of  the Senate, in which he requests that Senator Corneliu Vadim  Tudor's behavior should be discussed by the Commission of  Discipline and Immunity of the Senate, Lieutenant General  Niculae Spiroiu is back again.    Yesterday, on 2 February, he addressed an open letter to the  presidents of the two chambers of the parliament, in which he  broadly discusses the scandalous situation in which the Romanian  Army and its minister are placed. Niculae Spiroiu requested  that the Commissions in change of defense, public order, and  national security should be convened in a meeting and thus, he  should be given the opportunity to explain the aberrant  situation and the very serious accusations of the PRM senator.  Until now, presidents Adrian Nastase and Oliviu Gherman have  had a more than tolerant attitude toward Vadim Tudor's abnormal  attacks directed against the Romanian Army.</p>

			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Survey of Software at Work (27): Improved care for industry members - Case Study / British Paper and Board / When faced with the task of updating its data-handling methods, the paper industry's trade group decided on a system already used by other similar associations NOT ALL bespoke developments are enormous, involving huge investments in software, hardware and personnel. More modest projects can still yield important benefits for their users. The British Paper and Board Federation is a trade body which was established more than 100 years ago to represent the interests of paper and board manufacturers throughout the UK. It provides members with advice on industrial relations, health and safety, and energy, lobbies the Government, provides training, and produces industry statistics. It used a Xionics personal computer running under the CP/M operating system for its membership data, and wanted to upgrade this. Systems manager Eric Kilby says: 'Our existing system was fairly old and no longer capable of handling our work load.' The organisation decided a Unix-based system was needed, offering full office automation. British Paper and Board was open-minded in its choice, looking at five possible systems over two years. The favoured hardware was an IBM RS/6000 or a Wyse 7000 machine. Mr Kilby had come across the software house, Care Business Solutions, at an exhibition some years before the choice was made, and he remembered that Care specialised in software dealing with trade associations. The federation had already decided to use the Uniplex office automation package, because it is considered an industry standard, well-known to many users. Any software chosen would need to interact with that. Care proposed a system based on the Empress database management system to hold the federation's mailing data, and provide an information system. Care developed a system for the Wyse 7000 computer which could be run under Uniplex, appearing to the user as part of that product and called from its menus. The system holds around 2,000 names and addresses (including 650 Members of Parliament) and is an adaptation of Care's standard set of modules for trade associations. The federation has no in-house development department, but Mr Kilby, who has a background in statistics and economics, has been trained in Empress and will do further development if necessary. Meanwhile, support continues to come from Care, with regular contact each week. If any problems arise, they can be corrected via a modem link between the two organisations. At present the federation uses the Paradox product on personal computers for local database needs and for producing reports, but users will be converted to Empress and the centralised package in due course - 'all information is held by individuals, using Paradox, but has common data. We can improve our efficiency and information gathering by centralising it,' Mr Kilby argues. Other allied bodies for which the federation produces figures, including the Recycling Information Centre and the Pulp and Paper Information Centre, have access to the federation's membership information.</p>

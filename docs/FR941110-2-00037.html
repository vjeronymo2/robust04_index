			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's Position:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The load rating of individual bearings for the periods under review is available in any Koyo catalogue and, as such, is part of the public domain. Therefore, we have made the appropriate corrections in the load rating of the model designated by Koyo.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 45:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Timken points out that the preliminary program erroneously sets certain home-market VCOMs equal to zero. Timken states that for certain set-split bearings only VCOM is zero. For others the VCOM, net unit price, and indirect selling expenses are zero, resulting in erroneous calculations for FMV and the weighted-average home-market indirect selling expenses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Timken notes that this problem has been discussed with Department personnel and revision of the program instructions will apparently result in assignment of correct values.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Koyo affirms Timken's observation, stating that the Department erred in its calculation of the cup and cone ratios during the set-splitting exercise, resulting in the progressive reduction of the cup and cone ratio variables and, consequently, the VCOM ratio.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's Position:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We agree with Koyo and Timken. We inappropriately altered VCOM when we merged the home-market sales and cost data files and split the home-market sales of TRB sets into sales of cups and cones. However, Koyo's explanation that the cup and cone ratios are progressively reduced toward zero is wrong, as evidenced from the computation of the home-market net unit prices and indirect selling expenses for sales of split sets. We have determined that the value for the VCOM itself was reduced toward zero, and have corrected the calculations accordingly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We also found a similar error in the calculations where we split home-market sales of TRB sets with no reported cup or cone ratios using the weighted-average of the reported cup and cone ratios as BIA for each POR. We have also corrected this error.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 46:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Timken believes that a discrepancy in the U.S. sales values reported by Koyo and those analyzed by the Department in its preliminary results signifies that the Department either dropped some U.S. sales from the database or it perhaps dropped sales that lacked data.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Koyo claims that Timken is comparing apples to oranges. The U.S. sales numbers from the Department's analysis memorandum appear to represent net USP figures, whereas the figures cited from Koyo's 1991 submission are gross figures. Koyo adds that it has found no discrepancies in the value of U.S. sales used by the Department.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's Position:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We agree with Koyo. It is impossible to arrive at any definitive conclusion by comparing Koyo's gross sales figures to the net sales figures calculated by the Department. We are satisfied that we used all of Koyo's reported U.S. sales in our analysis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 47:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Timken maintains that in analyzing Koyo's transactions, the Department failed to make any adjustment to USP, FMV, or CV for packing expenses. In addition, Timken states that, if it is not practical to apply packing expenses on a LOT basis, we should apply the higher value to all sales.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Koyo states that the Department deducted home-market packing from FMV, but that the Department failed to adjust FMV for U.S. packing. Both Timken and Koyo urge the Department to adjust for packing in accordance with its normal practice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's Position:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We agree with Koyo that we inadvertently failed to add U.S packing expenses to FMV and CV. For these final results we have made this correction pursuant to 19 CFR 353.56 and 353.50.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 48:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NSK notes that it inadvertently included in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its U.S. sales listing certain U.S. sales of TRBs over four inches in outside diameter ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , outside the scope of the finding). NSK contends that it advised the Department of this oversight in a timely manner, and points out that the Department nonetheless included these sales in its analysis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NSK notes further that a reported 1986 sale of a U.S. bearing which lacked a part number and had an unusually high price in fact corresponded to the sale of a four-row cylindrical roller bearing. NSK claims that cylindrical roller bearings are outside the scope of the finding and, thus, the Department should exclude this U.S. sale from its analysis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Timken agrees with NSK that the above-cited models are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> out-of-scope merchandise and should not be included in the Department's analysis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's Position:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We agree. We have excluded all U.S. sales of bearings over four inches in diameter, as well as the one U.S. sale of cylindrical roller bearings, from our analysis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 49:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NSK and Timken point out that the Department incorrectly treated certain U.S. expenses (warehousing, inventory carrying costs, duty, and inland freight) as factors, rather than as actual amounts. Both parties agree that NSK reported these expenses as actual amounts,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , an expense of ``.25'' should be read as twenty-five cents rather than twenty-five percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's Position:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We agree. We inadvertently treated the reported expenses as factors rather than as actual amounts. We have made the appropriate correction to the computer program for these final results of review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 50:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NSK contends it reported certain export expenses (ocean freight, export, insurance, SG&amp;A) as a percentage of C.I.F. price, and that the Department incorrectly treated these expenses as a percentage of reported unit price. NSK argues that the Department should only apply these factors to unit price where NSK has not reported a C.I.F. price.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Timken agrees with NSK's position, and emphasizes that expenses reported by NSK as a percentage of C.I.F. price should be applied to unit price where a C.I.F. price has not been reported.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's Position:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We agree. We have made the appropriate correction to our calculations for these final results of review. We have applied expenses, which NSK reported as a percentage of C.I.F. price, to unit price where NSK did not report a C.I.F. price.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 51:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Timken contends and NSK agrees that in adjusting NSK's CV for direct and indirect selling expenses, the Department reversed the relevant variables in its computer program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's Position:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We agree and have made the necessary corrections for these final results.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 52:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Timken notes that the CV calculations for NSK do not include export packing expenses. Timken argues that the CV  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calculation, in accordance with the statute, must include export packing expenses. Timken also contends that ``palletizing'' expenses should be included as packing expenses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NSK agrees with Timken's observations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's Position:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We agree that CV must include export packing expenses pursuant to section 773(e) of the Tariff Act. We have therefore added NSK's export packing expenses, which were reported as a percentage of ``processing cost'', as well as palletizing expenses, to CV. In addition, we note that in our preliminary results we did not add NSK's U.S. packing expenses to FMV for price-to-price comparisons, but we have corrected this for these final results.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Toyota Correction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although no parties submitted comments regarding the preliminary results for Toyota, we discovered a programming error in our preliminary calculations for Toyota that resulted in the exclusion of all PP sales from the preliminary weighted-average margin calculation. For these final results we have corrected this error by incorporating all sales in our final weighted-average margin calculation for Toyota.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

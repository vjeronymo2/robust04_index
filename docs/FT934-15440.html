			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / People: Broad-based team for new science council The new Council for Science and Technology, which will advise the government on scientific issues of 'strategic national importance', was named yesterday. It is chaired by William Waldegrave, the minister for science, with Bill Stewart, the government's chief scientist, as deputy chairman. The other 10 members are a strong blend of research managers from industry and universities. The prime minister launched the CST with a statement that he would regard it as 'an important source of independent expert advice.' If so, it will be more influential than its predecessor, the Advisory Council for Science and Technology, which produced worthy reports that made little impact in Whitehall. The replacement of ACOST with the higher-powered CST was one of the measures promised in the government's white paper on science in May. The most powerful businessman on CST is Richard Sykes, chief executive of Glaxo, who controls Britain's largest corporate research budget. Glaxo expects to spend Pounds 850m on next year on R&amp;D - only Pounds 250m less than the government's own research councils. Other industrial members are: Sir Robin Nicholson, research director of Pilkington, the glass manufacturer (and chief scientific adviser to Mrs Thatcher from 1983 to 1985); Sir Ralph Robins, chairman of Rolls-Royce and head of the Defence Industries Council; Alan Rudge, British Telecom's managing director of development and procurement; John Towers, group managing director of British Aerospace's Rover subsidiary; and Peter Williams, chairman of Oxford Instruments. CST's academic contingent is somewhat smaller: Sushantha Bhattacharyya, professor of manufacturing systems at Warwick University; Sir Aaron Klug, director of the Medical Research Council's Laboratory of Molecular Biology; Bridget Ogilvie, director of the Wellcome Trust, the largest UK research charity; and Stewart Sutherland, vice-chancellor of the University of London (and a philosopher by training - the only CST member without a science or engineering background). The council is expected to convene for the first time within the next month and then to meet about four times a year.</p>

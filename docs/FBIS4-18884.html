			<p>BFN     [Text] Munich -- Rudolf Scharping, the Social Democratic  Party of Germany's [SPD] candidate for chancellor will make a  binding promise to the United States Administration that after  the Bundestag elections his party will not chose a coalition  partner that wants to abolish NATO and Bundeswehr. This was  said by SPD Federal Manager Guenter Verheugen in an interview  with FOCUS news magazine prior to Scharping's visit to the  United States.    Verheugen said that there will be no partner in Germany for  the policy adopted by the Greens at their congress in Mannheim.  Scharping's message to the United States will be: "Germany will  remain a reliable alliance partner that keeps its obligations."</p>

Tsai] </F>   [Text] Taipei, March 19 (CNA) -- In a new bid to help  address Taiwan's snowballing trade deficit with Japan, a market  development and technology transfer center will be established  on July 1, economics officials said Saturday [19 March]    Promoted by C.F. Koo, chairman of the Taiwan-Japan Economic  and Trade Development Foundation, and Economic Affairs Minister  P.K. Chiang, the center aims to push for trade and technological  cooperation between the two countries, they noted.    The center will coordinate domestic efforts to seek  technology transfers from Japan, which could be achieved through  strategic business alliances, they pointed out.    Currently, domestic organizations responsible for promoting  trade ties with Japan include the Republic of China [ROC]  Committee of the East Asian Businessmen Conference, the  Taiwan-Japan Business Cooperation Conference, and Taiwan's  Japan-oriented Exporters Association.    The officials stressed that the combined business forces of  the two countries in capital, technology, and marketing will  certainly help promote the upgrading of the industrial base in  Taiwan.    The goal could be achieved by beginning with the  establishment of joint ventures to produce key parts and  components in Taiwan, they said.    In goodwill response to Taiwan's new move, a group of  Japan's  senior business executives including Shoichiro Toyota, the  newly- elected president of the Federation of Economic  Organizations (Keidanren), will visit Taiwan in early July.    The Japanese side is planning to organize the largest-ever  technology transfer group with a view to promoting the transfer  of high-tech know-how to Taiwan, the officials said.    Taiwan has been plagued by a huge trade deficit with Japan.  The trade imbalance, which totaled US$14.22 billion in 1993, is  expected to top US$16 billion this year.</p>

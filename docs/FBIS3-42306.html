[passage omitted]    On the terrorism issue, al-Shar' said that Damascus fully  supports Turkey's territorial integrity, reiterating that Syria  does not support the terrorist PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan]  organization.    `Turkey's future can only be determined by its own people,  no  other foreign forces can decide for it,' he said, adding Syria  denounces any kind of terrorism.    However al-Shar' did not qualify the terrorist PKK  organization as `terrorist.' Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin,  who held the opening speech of the meeting, said that the  tripartite consultation meeting was held to evaluate the latest  situation in the region where the three countries are situated  specially the developments in Iraq, adding it is not directed  against any other country.    He said the protection of Iraq's territorial unity is as  vital for the three countries concerned as for the whole world,  adding the support or incentives towards separatist movements is  unacceptable, a point also stressed by Syria and Iran.

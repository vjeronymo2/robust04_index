			<p>Language: <F P=105> Norwegian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Aslak Bonde and Hilde Harbo report: "Oyangen's Agreement </F> Concluded Last Night"]    [Text] In the very early hours, Agriculture Minister  Gunhild Oyangen was finally able to present the agricultural  chapter of the accession agreement with the EU [European Union].  For the most part, it is like the agreement concluded with  Finland last week, but there are better terms for the most  vulnerable sector of the foodstuffs industry as well as  regarding the scale of the permanent subsidy arrangements.    "We can give extra support to 85 percent of the country. The  measures we pushed through for [the area] north of the 62d  degree of latitude we can also give to large parts of southern  Norway, including parts of Hedmark and Oppland, the northernmost  parts of Buskerud and Telemark, the mountainous areas of Agder  and Rogaland, and substantial parts of Sogn og Fjordane, and  Hordaland."  <H5>  Districts Safeguarded </H5>   "This is a good agreement for Norway, one which safeguards  what we sought to achieve all along. Employment and settlement  in the regions has been safeguarded," said Gunhild Oyangen.    The agriculture minister also said that she is happy with  the  agreements reached on the foodstuffs industry.    Norway and the EU agreed on a declaration that makes  provision for Norway to request the European Commission to  impose a ceiling on imports of manufactured agricultural  products. The condition is that documentary evidence can be  provided that free imports from other EU countries are actually  hindering the healthy reorganization of the Norwegian foodstuffs  industry. This applies to meat, flour, canned products, animal  feed, and most dairy products.    These measures will be available for use over a three-year  period. During this time, support for restructuring will also  be given.    "These measures will give us sufficient time to reorganize.  And the important thing is that we have won understanding for  our `better safe than sorry' principle," said Oyangen.    Before the agreement had been approved, none of the  Norwegian  negotiators had wanted to be quoted as saying that Norway had  achieved a better deal than Finland as regards protection for  its foodstuffs industry. Nevertheless they indicated that they  had something positive to bring home.  <H5>  Understanding </H5>   Earlier yesterday, the minister of agriculture said that she  was far from displeased with the attitude she had encountered in  Brussels: "I would like to say that there are many here in  Brussels who know more about Norwegian agriculture -- and have a  greater respect for it -- than many Norwegians."    Yesterday Gunhild Oyangen was able to present a far more  detailed agreement than the Finns could last week. For Finland,  it has been unclear all along how the safety clause for the  foodstuffs industry was meant to work.    This Finnish solution, which Norway was initially expected  to  receive a virtually identical copy of, was met by a storm of  protests from the Norwegian foodstuffs industry. Gunhild  Oyangen was given rough treatment when she returned home unable  to point to Norwegian solutions that were better in practice  than the Finnish ones. Over the last few days in Brussels, she  and her negotiators have fought tooth and nail to gain some  improvements.    "It was extremely necessary for Norway to secure durable  solutions, because the EU's agricultural policy is not adapted  to the circumstances in Norway," said Gunhild Oyangen. She  noted with satisfaction that the EU has changed its agricultural  policy as a result of the enlargement negotiations.</p>

			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / International Company News: Bank of New York earnings jump 52% BANK of New York, which last year agreed to buy 62 branches from the US subsidiary of Barclays Bank, yesterday unveiled a healthy 56 per cent jump in its first-quarter net earnings, to Dollars 125m. The first-quarter profit translates into fully-diluted earnings per share of Dollars 1.37, up from 97 cents in the same quarter of 1992. The result was achieved on the back of wider interest margins, higher fee income, lower non-performing assets and better earnings resulting from a continuing shift in the bank's mix of assets. The bank, with total assets of Dollars 40bn, said fee income rose by 14 per cent year-on-year, to Dollars 108m, thanks largely to credit card processing. Total non-performing assets dropped by 33 per cent, to Dollars 860m, while bad debt provisions in the quarter declined to Dollars 100m from Dollars 157m in the first quarter of 1992. Net interest income was Dollars 334m in the quarter, compared with Dollars 308m a year before. Non-interest income increased by 11 per cent to Dollars 320m in the quarter. The adoption of new accounting standards resulted in a Dollars 46m charge to retained earnings for prior periods, but the bank said the charge would have no future impact. Its return on assets in the quarter was 1.2 per cent, up from 0.77 per cent. On Wall Street, the Bank of New York's shares closed Dollars 1 1/4 lower at Dollars 60 1/2 . Wachovia, the North Carolina-based bank, reported that its first-quarter net income rose by 14.6 per cent to Dollars 121.6m, or 69 cents a share. First of America Bank realised first-quarter securities gains of Dollars 7.2m, pushing earnings for the period to Dollars 58.6m, or 98 cents, Reuter reports. It earned Dollars 26m, or 41 cents, in the first quarter of 1992.</p>

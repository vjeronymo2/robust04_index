			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Pay rises at UK banks fall below rate of inflation PAY RISES in the UK banking sector have fallen to their lowest level since the 1960s, with all the big banks settling for rises below the inflation rate. Yesterday it became clear that more than 28,000 clerical staff at the Midland Bank will accept 3.5 per cent. Later this week, Barclays Bank is expected to impose a 3 per cent rise. Lloyds imposed a settlement of about 4 per cent earlier in the year - although it is slightly higher when calculated over a whole year - and the National Westminster about 2.5 per cent. Only the Bank of Scotland has bucked this trend with an offer worth between 5 and 5.5 per cent. The Midland offer, the last from the big four in the current pay round, is being recommended by the executive of the Bifu banking union. It is worth a total of 3.8 per cent on the pay bill because some peak-time workers are getting a special extra rise to allow them to sign up for the bank pension scheme. Managerial pay, which also rose rapidly in the 1980s, is showing further signs of restraint. According to the latest survey by PE International management consultants, median salary rises for UK executives in the six months to April stood at 5.5 per cent. This compares with median increases of 10 per cent over the same period last year. The PE International survey of managers' pay says that 11 out of 101 companies surveyed decided to defer their pay reviews. Employers and government ministers will be pleased to see that the 150,000-plus banking sector - where pay rises helped fuel white-collar pay inflation of the late 1980s - is now acting as a drag, rather than a push, on overall average earnings. Bank pay rises have even fallen below first-quarter settlements in the manufacturing sector, which the Confederation of British Industry calculated at 4.3 per cent. However, pay analysts expect the latest average earnings figures, for release by the Department of Employment on Thursday, to be holding up at about 7 per cent. The earnings index figures are inflated by overtime and other bonuses. The index is also slow to reflect falling inflation and settlements because it takes into account all pay rises over the previous 12 months. According to Mr Alistair Hatchett, of Incomes Data Services, the generosity of the banks and other employers in the City of London in the late 1980s caused big problems for many other employers of white-collar staff competing in the same sector of the market. The latest settlements reflect depressed conditions in the financial services sector and some banks' provisions for bad debts. The rises are about half the level of last year. Similarly restrained rises are being awarded at smaller banks, according to Bifu. The TSB yesterday offered its 17,000 non-managerial staff a 3.5 per cent rise, which Bifu is recommending they accept, and Yorkshire Bank negotiators will meet on Thursday to discuss an offer of 3.3 per cent.</p>

			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / Arts: Magical 'Dream' is a bit low on humanity - Theatre Just about everything in the Royal Shakespeare Company's new production of A Midsummer Night's Dream is mint-fresh. Every line seems to have been newly considered, so that you never feel, in this most familiar of Shakespeare plays, that you know how the rest of a speech or scene will go. The director is Adrian Noble and this spontaneity is perhaps the hallmark of his Shakespearian work. His designer, Anthony Ward, has some peculiar colour schemes but achieves some breathtaking effects of magic with his decor. Fairyland is a hanging forest of lightbulbs; Titania's bower is a vast bed-sized upside-down umbrella that lifts her and Bottom into the ether; and characters enter the wood through doors at the back, as if they were stepping into another world through CS Lewis's wardrobe. Chris Parry's lighting and Sue Lefton's choreography add further magic. Yet, especially when you look at its individual characters, this is a callow account of the play. Noble has assembled the best possible cast from current Stratford performers, and yet he elicits performances no better than might be achieved by actors far less illustrious. This is especially true of the four mortal lovers, who are played without pathos, dignity, or depth. Why cast Toby Stephens (the RSC's current Coriolanus) as Lysander, Emma Fielding (its current Viola) as Hermia, or Haydn Gwynne (its Olivia and, in Peer Gynt, both Aase and Solveig) as Helena, when these roles - and Demetrius (Kevin Doyle) - are conceived as two-dimensional? Puck may say 'what fools these mortals be', but we need not. The fact that love's unfairness and Puck's mistakes hurl these four people into dismay never becomes serious. Sure, we should find their situation absurd. Now and then, however, as when Helena reminds Hermia of 'the hours that we have spent when we have chid the hasty-footed time for parting us', we should see them as having some depth of feeling. When Hermia asks her ex-lover Lysander what greater harm than hate can he do her, we should see intelligence within misery. Lysander and Demetrius are clever enough to poke witty fun at Pyramus &amp; Co. Not so here. Gwynne and Fielding perform Helena and Hermia neither impetuously enough to be particularly funny nor dignified enough to be poignant. Stephens and Doyle scarper about like buffoons. If A Midsummer Night's Dream takes so low a view of human beings, it is a remarkably un-Shakespearian play. But Shakespeare's plasticity of characterisation is never apparent in this staging. Noble goes in for the double-casting whereby the same actors play Oberon and Theseus, Titania and Hippolyta, Puck and Philostrate. Alex Jennings wields a nice vein of pixie-like malice as Oberon, but cannot hold our attention with the role's flights of lyrical description; he plays Theseus much the same way, but since this role has little lyricism, it succeeds more easily. Stella Gonet floods the theatre with wanton, elfin charm as Titania and Hippolyta: ravishing but not really persuasive. Barry Lynch's lithe Puck comes off better. There are many fresh strokes - such as Oberon's way of tripping up both Demetrius and Puck or how he and Puck survey the mortals' confusions from on top of doorways - but these are incidental. The massive scale of Oberon's and Titania's power-games, which affects the whole cycle of the seasons, does not become interesting. Instead, Theseus and Hippolyta heavily hint that they know what they were doing as Oberon and Titania, which leaves an unpleasant aftertaste. Desmond Barrit does some marvellous things with sweet bully Bottom - overwhelming the rustics' rehearsal with his am-dram ambitions, equipped with not only donkey-ears but also massive donkey-teeth when transformed by Puck, and surprisingly quiet in Pyramus's grief. But I was surprised to see him mugging sometimes at the audience; and the role's humanity - Bottom's beautiful bewilderment on awakening, and his life-enhancing immediacy on returning to the rehearsals - does not quicken the pulse. Indeed, the finest performance in the whole cast is Philip Voss as Peter Quince; the patient way he deals with Bottom and his helpless delivery of his prologue have the funny and touching humanity that is too seldom in evidence elsewhere. Kenn Sabberton's Snug/Lion has it too; and Daniel Evans's Flute, beaming his way feyly through Thisbe, is the funniest of all. Moment by moment, this Dream is absolutely vivid; but Noble has wasted an illustrious cast and has given the play vigour at the expense of human variety. In RSC repertory at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon until January 19.</p>

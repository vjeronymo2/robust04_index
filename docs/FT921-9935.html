			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Mandela explains ANC position on foreign debt Mr Nelson Mandela, president of the ANC, yesterday issued the following statement on the alleged conflict between the ANC and himself on foreign loans to South Africa. 'Press articles suggest that there is a discrepancy between the African National Congress and its president on the repayment of foreign loans. In actual fact, there is no such discrepancy. The previous statements of secretary-general Cyril Ramaphosa and other ANC spokesmen have been taken out of context by the press. 'The articles create an impression that the ANC secretary general issued a statement on the loans issue in relation to the attempts by the development bank of southern Africa (DBSA) to raise funds in international capital markets. Mr Ramaphosa did not issue such a statement. The statement was issued by the Department of Information and Publicity of the ANC. The articles also combine the debt issue with the nationalisation question even though there is no direct link between the two. 'The ANC accepts, as a general policy that a future democratic state has an obligation to pay foreign debts which were incurred by the present regime in the normal course of administration before financial sanctions were imposed by the international community. 'The terms of repayment of such loans may be re-negotiated to ensure that a democratic government is not unduly burdened by foreign debts incurred by an illegitimate regime. 'What is totally unacceptable to us is the attempt by the South African regime, acting in concert with certain foreign financial institutions, to bust financial sanctions adopted by the international community. 'By so doing these institutions are undermining the negotiation process in South Africa. If they have a genuine interest in South Africa they would put pressure for the immediate installation of an interim government of national unity in South Africa. If these institutions lend money to the apartheid regime now, they will in fact be acting to delay our forward march to freedom, democracy and development. 'We therefore want to reiterate that the ANC is opposed to any bond issues currently being launched in the international capital markets. In terms of our sanctions policy, sanctions will be lifted (with the exception of the oil and arms embargo) when an interim government of national unity has been installed.'</p>

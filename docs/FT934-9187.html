			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee producers to discuss retention scheme COFFEE PRODUCERS meet in New York today to discuss modifications to the producers' retention scheme that came into effect at the beginning of October. The producers plan to discuss changes to the amount of robusta coffee held back from the market and a way of checking stock levels. Brazil made its first purchases as part of the retention scheme last week, but dealers were surprised at the small amounts bought. The producers need to buy around 180,000 bags of coffee before next Monday as part of October's retention plans, but so far, Brazil, which has agreed to act as a purchasing agent on behalf of producers, has bought only 11,750 bags. Buyers will be back in the market today after having lowered the quality of coffees they can purchase and raised prices. However, market traders were sceptical they could meet their obligations. Talks today and tomorrow are unlikely to have much effect on coffee prices which have weakened this week, but prices could be boosted if Brazil is successful in buying most of its commitments. Producers said they agreed to meet at regular intervals to monitor the operation of the retention scheme. The retention scheme aims to keep 20 per cent of their exports off the market in order to encourage consumers to draw down stocks.</p>

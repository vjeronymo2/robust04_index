			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Yi Chong-won] </F>   [Text] Western sources in Seoul knowledgeable in North  Korean-Chinese relations reported on 27 April that China  provided North Korea with food, including 10,000 tonnes of rice,  as "birthday gifts" on 15 April, President Kim Il-song's  birthday.    Reporting that China also "presented" 10 tonnes of meat and  five tonnes of edible oil to North Korea, the sources noted:  "The delivery of those 'food gifts' by China was very unusual,  and it hints of North Korea's food problems." It was learned  that China gave North Korea 400 tons of pork as a gift on  President Kim's birthday in 1992.    Regarding this, the ROK Government officials knowledgeable  in  North Korean affairs said: "In 1993, North Korea yielded only  3.8 million tonnes of rice due to the cold weather, and the  amount is down 500,000 tonnes from other years and falls  absolutely short of its necessary rice amount of 6.3 million  tonnes." They added: "China provides North Korea with 1 million  tonnes of rice every year in the form of barter trade. It is  unprecedented, however, for China to present food to North Korea  free of charge."    Government officials analyzed that, although the 10,000-ton  rice provided by China is insufficient to solve North Korea's  food problems, it was probably of help in somewhat increasing  the North Korean people's rice rations or in increasing the  ratio of rice in mixing rice and other grains.    This amount of rice can be loaded on 2,000 five-ton trucks  and is over 50,000 soms -- North Korea sent 50,000 soms of rice  to the ROK when we suffered flood damage in the middle of 1983.</p>

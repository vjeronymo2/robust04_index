			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / Sport: You must know the score - Golf They are usually the size of a juggernaut and they are everywhere you look at a major championship. Everywhere, that is, except where the modern player looks. 'Scoreboard? What is a scoreboard?' The one on the 18th hole at Southern Hills is particularly large but, because of a row of giant oaks, has been positioned in such a way as to make its contents unreadable to the players competing in this week's USPGA championship until they reach the final green. But what does it matter anyway when the top young players never seem to want to avail themselves of the wisdom a scoreboard offers? Consider what has happened at the last two major championships. First, we reeled from Ernie Els's revelation that on the final hole at the US Open he was about to attempt a death or glory blow from the trees without knowing whether it was necessary or not. Els was lucky. His caddy stopped him just before he was about to embark on his reckless course of action, pointing out that a birdie three was not necessary, the four would win him the tournament and a five would get him into a play-off. Els settled upon the latter figure, won the play-off and is now feted wherever he goes instead of being ridiculed, as he surely would have been if left to his own devices. As he admitted, on a scale of one to 10, his chances of successfully completing the stroke were no more than one. But that was as nothing compared to what happened at the Open. There Jesper Parnevik was not nearly so fortunate. He came to the 18th hole leading by no less than two strokes. Not that he knew. There might have been scoreboards everywhere but Parnevik kept the blinkers on. With his approach shot he went for the flag which was cut just above a sharp incline, with anything falling short resulting in an almost certain bogey. Parnevik fell short. A shot to the 'fat' of the green and two putts for a par four would have got him into a play-off even accounting for Nick Price's eagle three on the 17th. Parnevik took five. Only then did he look at the scoreboard. As Price's heroics were recorded, he looked in disbelief. What is it about this generation of players that they purposefully deprive themselves of what seem to be vital pieces of knowledge? Every journalist reports a tournament in the same way. Some might concentrate on the personalities of the leading scorers and others write about the golf. But everyone writes in some way about the leader, how he is doing in relation to par, and how the other players are faring. This is always in regard to how far they are behind the pace-setter. There is hardly a young professional who approaches his round in this way. So they have shot 72 in the first round? They see that they are on level par. So the winning score in such-a-such a tournament is usually 12 under? That means they have to shoot three 68s in the rounds that remain, or variations on that theme. They never consider themselves to be eight behind the player who has opened with a 64: they are 12 behind their final target. History tells them that the leader is going to endure a humbling last three days, so there is no point worrying about his or her score. Eight times out of 10 this logic serves them well, but on the final holes of a major championship that theory is worthless. 'I don't think I could play the 18th hole of a major without knowing exactly what I needed to score to win,' Greg Norman said this week. Jack Nicklaus said: 'I agree with the philosophy of not worrying about what anybody else is doing for the first 63 or so holes of a tournament. I never looked at a scoreboard either. But I always kept a close eye on the scoreboards over the closing holes because - and this depended on how I was doing of course - it would dictate how I played certain shots.' Arnold Palmer said that he always looked at scoreboards wherever they were on a course, whether it was the first hole or the 72nd. He just liked to see how everyone else was doing and whether he was playing as well or as badly as he thought. One thing is abundantly clear: it is experience of playing a game at this level that teaches a golfer that scoreboards are not just things to keep spectators up to date with what is going on. It was unfortunate for Parnevik to discover the hard way. But tomorrow evening the leader, after his drive on to the 18th fairway, will have to jog up to the green to discover exactly what is required.</p>

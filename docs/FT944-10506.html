			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / Arts: 'Romeo' from Tel Aviv The large sculpted horse that is the only prop in Rina Yerushalmi's production of Romeo and Juliet looks rather startled - as well he might. As a symbol of escape, he is to carry the burden of the tragedy on his back: Romeo and Juliet meet on him, act out the balcony scene on him, and cling to him desperately as things go wrong. It is a simple device, yet a surprisingly eloquent one, and typical of this beguiling production from Tel Aviv. This, the second Romeo and Juliet in the Everybody's Shakespeare season at the Barbican, is very different from the stark German production that launched the festival last week. Where the German production on the main stage was long and large scale, the Israeli one, staged in the Pit, is intimate and condensed; where that production focused on the confrontation in the play at the expense of the romance, this one emphasises the theme of love, at some cost to the violence; and where the first one created a bleak and harsh world, the second is soft, beautiful and sometimes bewildering. The mood of the piece even seeps out into the foyer. As the audience collect their tickets, a pair of masked lovers wander among them, looking rather lost. Inside, half-masked actors in black cloaks pad about the auditorium, smiling tantalisingly at the audience and addressing them, somewhat mystifyingly, in Hebrew. Soft music and subtle lighting suffuse the theatre in the languorous atmosphere that will permeate the production. Yerushalmi's intent, as she explains in the programme, is to use the language of theatre to capture the intoxicating feeling of being in love. She builds to some extent on commedia dell'arte, which helps to establish the mischievous, inventive mood of her production. The actors, dressed as a group of strolling players, are inspired by the Chorus to perform the play and act out the opening brawl in playful spirit. As they and the audience are sucked into the story, however, the mood changes. Once Romeo and Juliet have met, the play is compressed to the main moments. The central Romeo and Juliet remain on stage while other members of the cast speak their lines or perform their actions. This suggests the engulfing nature of love and its ability to distort perception. It works wonderfully in places. As the couple part after their night together, the main Romeo and Juliet stand wrapped around each other in mute adoration, while another couple speak their thoughts. And when Juliet visits Friar Laurence for the potion that will put her to sleep, four actresses creep around the stage in the flickering light, each totally wrapped up in her task. This may sound bizarre, but on stage it works, emphasising both the universality and the loneliness of passion. There is a price to be paid for this conceit. Sometimes it is confusing, sometimes it just seems tricksy and throughout it sacrifices the continuity of character that would help you empathise with Romeo and Juliet and experience their tragedy. The production also gives little hint of danger - the fight between Tybalt and Mercutio is a rather stagey affair. But there are some purely enchanting moments - to portray the ball, for instance, the actors simply file softly onto the stage carrying sparklers and surround Juliet in flickering light - and the whole production is performed with such charm, lilt and gentleness by the Itim Theatre Ensemble that it is hard to resist. Continues to November 12 at the Pit (071 638 8891).</p>

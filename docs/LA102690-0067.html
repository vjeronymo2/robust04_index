			<p><P> October 26, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANGELS WILL NOT OFFER DOWNING ARBITRATION;  </P> <P> BASEBALL: DECISION COULD MEAN END OF DESIGNATED HITTER'S CAREER WITH THE CLUB.  </P> <P> In a move that probably signals the end of Brian Downing's Angel career, the  club announced Thursday that it won't go to arbitration with the 40-year-old  designated hitter.  </P> <P> Downing, whose strong second-half performance carried him to a .273 batting  average, 14 home runs and 51 runs batted in during his club-record 13th season,  can file for free agency. He can also re-sign with the Angels.  </P> <P> Downing, who has been undergoing treatment for the side-muscle injury that has  hindered him the past two seasons, could not be reached for comment Thursday,  and his wife, Cheryl, said she did not know her husband's plans. Downing had  said during the season that he was considering retirement, but his sentiments  changed when his playing time increased and his batting average rose.  </P> <P> General Manager Mike Port said the announcement does not preclude a return for  Downing, who is the Angels' leader in games played, at-bats, runs, hits,  doubles, home runs, RBIs, extra-base hits and total bases. Port and Dan  O'Brien, the Angels' senior vice president for baseball operations, met with  Downing Thursday in a session Port characterized as "cordial" without  disclosing the outcome of their discussion.  </P> <P> "What this will mean as far as the relationship between Brian and the Angels is  unknown at this point," Port said. "I have to say that only time will tell.  It's difficult to say at this point whether he would fit into our plans for  next season. We, like a number of clubs, are going through our roster  situation, what with free agency, free-look free agency (which could be granted  a number of players affected by baseball's third collusion case) and trades.  It's difficult to address until the rosters are closer to being set . . .  </P> <P> "We just felt this was a situation that called for a face-to-face meeting. What  he may choose to do is something I would not prefer to comment on."  </P> <P> In a formality, the Angels also announced that they won't go to arbitration  with pitcher Greg Minton, who announced his retirement after the final home  stand of the season.  </P> <P> Donnie Hill filed for free agency Thursday, but it's expected that the Angels  will re-sign him. Hill signed with the Angels as a free agent in January. He  served as a backup infielder, hitting .264.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO     [Editorial Report] What the press has called the "Tapie  phenomenon"--the rise in popularity of Bernard Tapie, leader of  the Radical Energy list running for the European Parliament--is  discussed by Jerome Jaffre in the 5-11 May Paris weekly LE  NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR.    Tapie's popularity was confirmed by the results of a SOFRES  [French Opinion Polling Company] poll conducted on behalf of LE  NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR from 26 to 28 April among 1,000 individuals  over 18 who were personally interviewed. Respondents were asked  the following questions:    "Do you have the feeling that in the Euroelections Tapie  would..." reinforce the Left by attracting voters who would not  vote for it: 39 percent. Weaken the Left by lowering the score  of the list of Socialist Party (PS) leader Michel Rocard facing  the Rally for the Republic (RPR)-Union for French Democracy  (UDF) list: 36 percent. No opinion: 25 percent.    "In your opinion, is Tapie a demagogue who could easily be a  danger to democracy, or a man who comes from the people and is  able to speak for them?" A demagogue who could easily be as  danger to democracy: 30 percent A man who comes from the people  and is able to speak for them: 56 percent. No opinion: 14  percent.    According to Jaffre, the poll also included some  "surprises."  The vote for Tapie cannot spring from the populist behavior of  anti-Maastricht voters, given that out of 100 Tapie voters, 59  percent said they voted "yes," in the 1992 Maastricht  referendum, with only 16 percent voting "no" and 25 percent  abstaining or casting a blank ballot. Similarly, 62 percent did  not think that European integration threatens French identity,  56 percent thought that the disappearance of the European Union  (EU) would be serious for France, and only 17 percent wished  that European integration were slower. A second "surprise" was  that despite President Francois Mitterrand's perceived pro-Tapie  stance--which has been widely discussed in the press--the Tapie  electorate is much less "Mitterandist" than Michel Rocard's.  Some 73 percent of Rocard supporters trust the president,  compared with 54 percent of Tapie voters. Mitterrand's  presidential action was judged positively by 77 percent of  Rocard voters, compared with 61 percent of Tapie supporters.  Similarly, the Tapie electorate is neither opposed to Prime  Minister Edouard Balladur nor "frankly hostile" to the Right,  Jaffre commented. Some 55 percent trust the prime minister,  against 40 percent among Rocard voters, while 41 percent of  Tapie voters trust Rally for the Republic (RPR) leader Jacques  Chirac, compared with 26 percent of Rocard supporters. Finally,  on SOFRES' traditional Left-Right axis, 57 percent of Tapie  voters situated themselves in the center or even on the Right.</p>

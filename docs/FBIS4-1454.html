			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Nairobi, 28 Apr (AFP) -- Rwandan Government  forces shelled rebel positions from the Kigali airport Friday  [29 April] amid exchanges of small arms fire around the capital,  which is littered with corpses and threatened by cholera, a  United Nations official said. UN troops and Rwandan gendarmes  meanwhile guarded a hotel where 300 Rwandan civilians holed up  after pro-government militiamen threatened to butcher them,  Abdul Kabia, executive director of the UN Assistance Mission in  Rwanda (UNAMIR), told AFP by telephone from Kigali.

"There was no return of the mortar fire,  but there were small arms exchanges between the two sides around  town," he said. "There is still no breakthrough on the political  front." A unilateral ceasefire declared by the rebel Rwanda  Patriotic Front from Monday collapsed almost immediately. Kabia  said the UN had received no response from either side to  ceasefire proposals which it put forward this week.    "Kigali is like a ghost town," he said. Many civilians have  fled the embattled city, some for rebel-held territory to the  north and others for neighbouring countries. Those left are  desperately short of food as stockpiles of maize and beans were  looted when fighting erupted three weeks ago. Water and  electricity have been cut. Piles of unburied, rotting corpses on  the streets raised fears of a cholera epidemic. The mostly  Tutsi rebels seemed locked in a stalemate with militiamen and  government soldiers mainly from the majority Hutu tribe.  "Neither side seems able to gain the upper hand," said an aid  worker, also contacted by telephone in Kigali. "It's hell here."</p>

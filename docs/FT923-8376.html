			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / Arts: Hush THE Royal Court is going through an exciting period. Give it a few months more and we might see it has led a change in fashion, just as it did in the second half of the 1950s. There are two recent big successes behind it. The Court pioneered Ariel Dorfman's Death and the Maiden, which continues to run in the West End and has won awards around the world. It also brought to London John Guare's Six Degrees of Separation, which likewise filled the house and moved elsewhere. Now it has come up with Hush by April de Angelis, the key to which lies in its title. The common theme between Dorfman's play and Six Degrees is that they are about ambiguities, not certainties. No one in Death and the Maiden is quite sure what to do about the excesses of the past as a country moves from dictatorship to at least limited democracy. In Six Degrees no one is certain how to handle an imposter who happens to be black. Hush acknowledges the dilemmas of trying to come to terms with a world without fixed sign-posts. It is one of the first pieces I have seen by a British playwright that admits how much the world has changed since the collapse of communism, and tries to look forward to an unknown future rather than back to the supposed certainties of the past. It has become permissible, even at the Royal Court, to poke fun at the once fashionable left. As one of the characters says: 'This is an amazing time, an amazing time to be living in. Huge empires are breaking up. It's like the end of the ice age. Watching the ice cracking. All warm blooded species rejoice]' Those lines are spoken by a writer, Tony, who was probably always more of a liberal than a Marxist. Yet that is where the novelty of the play lies. If socialism is dead, can liberalism survive? The piece is called Hush because the question requires a pause for thought and prolonged, quiet discussion. The theatre has not approached such a new frontier for a very long time. Otherwise, the play is set in more conventional Royal Court terms. A 15-year-old girl is being ( playfully) buried on a beach. The girl subsequently demands, and gets, sex, from a character called Dogboy. He then practically turns canine and, having killed his dog, kills himself. Another girl, temporarily employed as the house cleaner, wants to go off to Tibet to meet the monks, there not being enough sex on the beach at home. Do not be put off by such old hat. Beneath the attempts to shock is a new voice trying to get out. Dogboy, played by Andy Serkis, is a reminder of the old question of what you do about people who don't quite fit: throw them out, try to be nice to them or send them to the social security? Tony, the liberal writer, played by Stephen Delane, finally gives him money and the social security telephone number. 'Throw your weight about,' he says. 'Demand to see the manager.' But it does not stop the suicide. Another plus about the Royal Court nowadays: everything is remarkably well-staged and acted. Hush, directed by Max Stafford-Clark and designed by Sally Jacobs, makes the playing area seem much bigger than it is. The piece has its faults, notably the character Colin who simply wanders off, but it certainly points in new directions. Royal Court Theatre, (071) 730 1745</p>

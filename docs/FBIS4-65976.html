			<p>BFN     [Text] The peace negotiations involving the legal  representatives of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Serbian aggressor,  and the contact group are continuing in the French town of  Talloires. According to sources close to the negotiators, the  talks so far have mainly focused on the contentious territorial  division and the future political setup of Bosnia-Herzegovina.    The Croatian and Bosniak delegation, for the sake of peace,  expressed readiness to compromise regarding the territorial  division, and have moved slightly closer to the 51-49 percent  division, in accordance with the ministerial agreement in Geneva.</p>

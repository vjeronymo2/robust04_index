What is happening now  is a final destruction of the peace process.    ['Umar] As national institutions in the area, what sort of  measures or decisions will you be adopting in the aftermath of  this incident?    [Al-Husayni] First of all, we summoned the foreign consuls  in Jerusalem to appraise them of the gravity of the situation  and convey to them our position and demands, which began with  disarming the settlers and providing international protection  for the Palestinians. The Israeli Army is unable to do so.  Apparently, it has a specific mission, which is only directed  against the Palestinians and provides adequate cover to the  settlers to do whatever they want. Hence, first of all we  demand the disarming of the settlers; second, international  protection; and third, other measures must follow to ensure  Israeli withdrawal on the basis that no settlements will remain  on Palestinian soil.    ['Umar] Do I understand from your remarks that you support  Mr. 'Arafat's statement this morning, which he made after the  incident?    [Al-Husayni] In fact, until now we have not received any  details of this statement, but I believe that as far as the  current peace process is concerned, modifications must be  introduced in the agreements that have been reached. We have  tried as much as possible to take a step forward, although not  complete a one, in order to advance the peace process. However,  what has happened today proves to us that such a step will not  be fruitful. Now, we want the talks to deal with a final  solution. We do not believe there is need for an interim stage,  because an interim stage will lead to further bloodshed and  losses.</p>

			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / 'Iraqi principle' for Africa: UN and aid agencies are under pressure to develop a new long-term relief strategy in the Horn of Africa THE United Nations and international aid agencies are under pressure to develop a new long-term relief strategy in the Horn of Africa amid mounting criticism of relief efforts in Somalia, Sudan and Ethiopia. The highest-level UN team to visit the Horn of Africa, led by Mr Jan Eliasson, under-secretary general for humanitarian affairs, and Mr James Grant, executive director of UNICEF, is touring the region. They have been told that the UN must address the crisis in the Horn in a new way. 'Year in, year out we come back to square one - innocent civilians starving and at the mercy of evil governments and ruthless rebel leaders who use food as a political weapon for military ends,' said Mr Abdul Mohamed, an expert on humanitarian relief in the Horn. 'The whole way the UN does business in the Horn must now be dramatically revised to search for long-term solutions.' The critical issue under review is sovereignty. Relief efforts in Sudan, Somalia and Ethiopia have traditionally been hampered by the international aid community's respect for sovereignty, which has allowed dictatorships to veto and manipulate relief efforts. The Islamic fundamentalist military regime in Sudan, for example, stopped all relief flights to southern Sudan in March to strengthen their most successful military offensive against rebels in the nine-year civil war. The campaign for a review of sovereignty mounted by African relief experts has been boosted by the UN-approved intervention in Iraq, Yugoslavia and Somalia. 'If the UN can say that the humanitarian imperative of saving the lives of Kurds and Shias in Iraq overrides the claims to sovereignty of President Saddam Hussein, then why shouldn't that principle be extended to Sudan and other African countries where governments have lost their moral right to sovereignty by failing to feed and protect their people?' asks Mr Kosti Manibe, deputy general secretary of the Sudan Council of Churches. In Somalia the arrival of the first armed UN troops to protect relief supplies from banditry and looting, expected today, is being heralded by relief experts as the first extension of the 'Iraqi principle' to Africa. But the exercise is still constrained by what many observers term the 'old way of doing business'. First there is the problem of relations with the warring factions. The UN and non-governmental agencies continue to negotiate with the warlords on deployment of troops and relief operations. The UN and NGOs have also, under the authority of the warlords, employed several thousand gunmen. They say it is necessary for the short-term goal of distributing food. Mr Murray Watson, a Somalia specialist, says that by dealing with the warlords as if they were governments the agencies are legitimising their position, which will make matters worse in the long term. 'These guys are criminals and butchers and should not be encouraged nor treated as legitimate authorities,' he says. 'It's a protection racket and this cycle of criminality has to be broken if relief is going to reach those in need and if a climate of peace and order is going to be restored.' The second big problem is the continuing lack of co-ordination among the agencies. UN agencies and NGOs continue to squabble among themselves and fly their own flags. 'If humanitarianism is their objective, rather than grabbing publicity and boosting their donor appeals, the UN and NGOs should urgently form a single, coherent relief administration following a single integrated programme,' says Mr Watson. Experts also say the agencies have yet to produce a comprehensive assessment of needs and establish a monitoring system to ensure that relief is actually getting to those in need and not producing a vicious spiral of food aid dependency. Furthermore there still appears to be no strategy for the long-term rehabilitation and development of Somalia. The re-establishment of the economy and the institutions of civil society, such as a police force and judiciary, will require the international supervision of a process of political dialogue leading to an interim administration. So far this has not received any serious attention. 'If delivery of emergency aid is not accompanied simultaneously by a political process the entire effort will go to waste,' says Mr Mohamed. Similar issues are being argued in southern Sudan. In a paper presented to the UN team Mr Lam Akol, one of the leading Sudanese rebel officials, presses for a review of relief efforts. Mr Akol says the situation is southern Sudan is now worse than it was three years ago when Mr Grant launched 'Operation Lifeline Sudan'  - an ambitious relief programme designed to arrange the delivery of food and medicine to the war-ravaged civilian population. The operation has been consistently undermined by both the government and the rebel faction led by Mr John Garang. In the past eight months the government has banned UN flights to certain towns in an effort to deny food to rebel supporters. Meanwhile, a UN airlift of food to the besieged garrison town of Juba, where up to 300,000 people are in critical need of food, has been halted several times because of rebel threats to shoot down relief aircraft. The UN estimates that at best it is able to reach 10-20 per cent of the southern population displaced by the war and desperately in need of food and medicine. In his paper Dr Akol calls the actions of both the government and Mr Garang's rebel faction 'criminal'. He says observing sovereignty is 'unrealistic'. 'The UN must use to the fullest extent the new strong role it has acquired since the collapse of the east-west polarisation to enforce the respect of human rights,' he says. Among the measures Mr Akol is pressing on the UN is the establishment of an 'exclusion zone' in southern Sudan, blocking government bombing raids and allowing UN use of force to deliver relief, and involvement in negotiations to end the civil war. Many of these issues challenge the UN and NGOs to travel down new roads. But Africans on the ground say that without a new initiative the world will be forced to continue feeding the starving next year and the year after.</p>

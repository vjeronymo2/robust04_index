			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / Blair stands against Post Office sale Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, yesterday launched a campaign to keep the Post Office in the public sector. He said he believed it would be 'foolish and dogmatic' to privatise a profitable and successful Post Office and urged the government to give it more commercial freedom in the public sector. Labour's campaign was launched amid signs that ministers doubt whether they will succeed in getting their favoured option of a partial sell-off through the Commons. Seven Tory MPs have signed an early-day motion calling for the corporation to remain nationalised but with more commercial freedom. A senior Whitehall official said: 'Ministers are not taking anything for granted. No one is over-confident. The government does understand the concerns of the so-called Post Office sceptics.' The government has published a green paper setting out three options: full privatisation of the Royal Mail and Parcelforce, the sale of 51 per cent of the shares in the two companies, or more commercial freedom in the public sector. Mr Blair said Labour's campaign was not based on ideological opposition to privatisation. He recently called for a 'dynamic market' and his advisers do not want to give the impression that the party is opposed to all privatisation. Mr Blair fears that private owners of Royal Mail would try to cut costs by reducing its payments to Post Office branches. 'That would put at risk many community post offices that need cross subsidies to stay open,' he said. Mr Robin Cook, Labour's trade and industry spokesman, said he would be travelling to many Tory marginal seats in rural areas to warn of the threat to village post offices that rely on cross subsidies. Mr Bill Cockburn, Post Office chief executive, emphasised that the government's decision to keep Post Office Counters in the public sector, but with freedom to conduct a wider range of businesses, assured the future of the countrywide network of 20,000 post offices.</p>

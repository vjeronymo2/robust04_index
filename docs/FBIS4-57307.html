			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Union Radio News" newscast] </F>   [Text] Conflict over the mechanisms implemented to end the  fall of the bolivar against the dollar continues. While the  Economic Cabinet has blamed the Central Bank of Venezuela for  the ineffectiveness of the measures applied in this regard,  Central Bank President Antonio Casas Gonzalez recalled that the  mechanisms for intervening in the banks was evaluated and  accepted by the executive branch.    Additionally, there are differences over control exchanges  between Finance Minister Julio Sosa Rodriguez and Asdrubal  Batista, minister for reforming the national economy. In this  regard, Casas Gonzalez admitted that the auction of foreign  currency will not resolve in itself the expectations of the  public but that this would depend on the policies on banking,  fiscal, and public order problems that convey credibility to the  community.</p>

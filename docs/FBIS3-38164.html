Chief of Staff spokesman Colonel Dogu Silahcioglu said that  all targets in Zhalah have been completely destroyed, adding  that in line with the confirmation of any information and  political authorities' directives, the TAF may at any moment  repeat similar operations.    Following close inspection of detailed air photographs of  the  region, it was determined that all the targets, including  training installations, tents, buildings, warehouses, and  communications bases have been hit and destroyed, Silahcioglu  said, adding that a total of 132 bombs were thrown at the  terrorist bases.    Accordingly, in line with the number of targets hit, there  has also been a large number of losses among the terrorist  members present in the camp at that time, he added.    Silahcioglu further said the aim of the operation was to  incapacitate all the elements of the organization, and this "was  reached with the destruction of the logistic center, the  training camp, in a way that cannot be repaired."    Answering a reporter's question on whether northern Iraqi  officials were warned or not, Silahcioglu said that Turkey has  in the past repeatedly warned the northern Iraqi officials, that  the terrorist targets in the region may be hit at any moment.</p>

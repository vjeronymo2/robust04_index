			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Lib Dems set out Lit Dem challenge The Liberal Democrats yesterday outlined some of the evidence they will be bringing before the High Court this week in order to have the result of the European parliamentary election in Devon and East Plymouth overturned. The party - which failed to win the seat by 700 votes, after more than 10,000 people backed a candidate calling himself a Literal Democrat - will today submit an electoral petition calling for the result to be declared void and the election to be re-run. Mr Graham Elson, Liberal Democrat general secretary, said that the party's case had been backed by statements of protest from electors. He said 269 affidavits had been delivered to party offices in Devon, and a further 120 were expected. The party is bringing the action under the Representation of the People Act 1983. The petition will name Mr Frank Palmer, the election returning officer, who accepted the nomination form of the Literal Democrat candidate, Mr Richard Huggett. It will also name Mr Giles Chichester, the successful Tory candidate, so that he can present his case.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by unnamed FINSKA NOTISBYRAN correspondent: </F> "Differing EU Signals From Iceland"]    [Text] Reykjavik -- In an interview with an Icelandic  publication Icelandic President Vigdis Finnbogadottir compared  the Nordic countries' interest in the European Union [EU] to  blind youthful infatuation. The publication, MANNLIF,  interviewed the president on the occasion of the 50th  anniversary of Icelandic independence.    "Our Nordic kinsmen are so deeply in love that they are  completely forgetting the rest of the family and the fact that a  great passion either cools, comes to an end, or ends in  marriage," the Icelandic president said.    According to Finnbogadottir, the European debate in the  Nordic countries has attached too much importance to material  benefits. Everything else has been overshadowed in this  discussion.    "There are other values which ought also to be taken into  consideration. In the future too people will continue to think  and write and will also need spiritual and cultural values."    The Icelandic president is not afraid that in its jubilee  year Iceland will become isolated from the Nordic family or from  European society. According to Vigdis Finnbogadottir, the  Icelanders have no reason to have an inferiority complex.    "Before we reach important decisions about European  cooperation we must weigh the situation as a people and as a  nation. We have to be able first to strengthen our economy and  make ourselves sufficiently strong so that we do not need to be  afraid that people and resources will flee the country," the  president said, referring to the economic crisis and the high  level of unemployment in Iceland.    "We have to abolish expressions like `ministate' and  `minipeople' from the Icelandic vocabulary," Vigdis  Finnbogadottir said. These words have been used in Iceland's  foreign policy debate.    "These words undermine a people's identity and  self-confidence. The Icelandic people has no need to feel  self-conscious," the president said.    But, taking a completely different approach , the Icelandic  foreign minister has said that Iceland could perhaps apply for  membership of the EU before the end of the year.</p>

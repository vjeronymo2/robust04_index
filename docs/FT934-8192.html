			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / World Trade News: UK companies in Indian power deals ROLLS-ROYCE and National Power of Britain yesterday announced plans to invest in two power stations in India. The moves suggest foreign groups are beginning to overcome the regulatory and other hurdles restricting entry into the Indian power industry. The announcements were the highlight of the opening day of a week of British business events in Bombay which included meetings between businessmen, and between Mr Manmohan Singh, the Indian finance minister and Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary. National Power, the generating group, together with Ashok Leyland, the Indian operating company of the London-based Hinduja business family, plans to take a 51 per cent stake in a Rs32bn (Pounds 684m) project for a 1,000MW coal-fired plant at Visakhapatnam in the central Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. The power purchase agreement is the first of its kind for a big power station. The government has been encouraging private companies, including foreign groups, to invest in power to alleviate chronic shortages, but the terms of power purchase agreements and of government guarantees have proved a stumbling block in many of the 40-plus projects under discussion. Indian officials hope the National Power agreement will now encourage other investors to press ahead with their negotiations. Rolls-Royce plans to invest in a Rs20bn station in partnership with the R P Goenka group, a Calcutta-based business combine. The 500MW plant is to be built at Chandil in the eastern state of Bihar. The partners propose to share a 40 per cent stake with the rest of the equity coming from a public issue, topped up with bank loans. Rolls-Royce is to have a Pounds 275m turnkey contract to supply equipment, much of it from the UK.</p>

The formula is pretty simple and looks effective: two parts Dallas gloss, two parts teenage interest from Neighbours, two parts pub life from Coronation Street, with lashings of sun and sex. Episode 1 begins with a girl being flung out of the macho rotter's flat, lock, stock and lacy knickers. Of course ITV is mounting a 60-minute special of Coronation Street as a spoiler (7.00) but then the BBC burned Grace Archer to death on the night that commercial television began in Britain and where did that get them? BBC1 follows its new soap with another screening of the overrated Australian comedy Crocodile Dundee (7.30) and ITV follows 'Coronation Street' with another screening of the overrated American comedy Three Men And A Baby (8.00). A new series of Antenna on BBC2 (8.00) begins with a programme about time travel. Also on BBC2 is a series genuinely new to Britain, Siskel And Ebert, in which two American film critics review new releases (11.15).</p>

			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / International Capital Markets: Tokyo proposes new stock futures index JAPAN'S Ministry of Finance is planning a new stock futures index in an attempt to end local criticism of the negative effects of futures and options trading, in which foreign brokers are particular active. The move is the latest twist in a long-standing row over the weakness of the Tokyo stock market caused by derivatives trading, which is blamed by the Tokyo stock exchange and some Japanese brokers for undermining investor confidence in stocks. The ministry is proposing a capitalisation weighted index, which takes into account the number of shares outstanding, to replace the Nikkei 225 futures index, which is a simple price average of 225 stocks. The proposal goes some way to addressing concerns about the Nikkei 225, which is seen as easily manipulated. The ministry is also considering rule changes and introduction of a circuit-breaker system.</p>

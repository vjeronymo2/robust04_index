The country  will be formed of cantons with Muslim and Croatian majorities  respectively. The office of the head of state is to alternate  annually between a Muslim and a Croat.    However, the problem lies in the details: Everything now  depends on whether the Muslims and the Croats really do  cooperate -- or whether the former are just waiting to  outmaneuver the latter, and the latter, for their part, see the  Bosnian solution just as an interim step toward joining the  Republic of Croatia.    The biggest factor of uncertainty are the Serbs. The U.S.  hopes that the Serbs will participate in the Bosnian federation.  However, there is the danger that including them might blow up  the building. The Serbs do not want Bosnia -- they want a  Greater Serbia.    If the bilateral Muslim-Croat federation comes about, then  something like a new Yalta line will be drawn between the Serbs  on the one hand and the Muslims and Croats on the other.  Whatever is on the western side of the line is influenced by  NATO and the European Union. Whatever is to the east of it --  that is, Serbia and the territories conquered by the Serbs --  will be under Russian protection.    The Croats and the Muslims derive one satisfaction from all  this: This time they are on the "western side." The first World  Bank loan of $700 million has already been prepared for Croatia.</p>

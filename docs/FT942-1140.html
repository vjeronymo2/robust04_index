			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Markets Report: Support fails Central banks launched large scale co-ordinated intervention to support the dollar but the US currency was unable to sustain brief gains, writes Motoko Rich. Taking their lead from the US Federal Reserve, a legion of central banks repeatedly purchased the dollar in a move the markets had been anticipating all week. The dollar at first rallied after the intervention began in the European afternoon, gaining more than a yen and about a pfennig and a half. But although the Fed was still seen purchasing the US currency after 3:00 pm GMT, the dollar lost most of its ground by the close of London trading. The dollar ended in London at DM1.5972, down from DM1.6035. Against the yen, it closed at Y100.900, down from Y101.150. Analysts said the intervention had reinforced market cynicism about central bank action. 'The intervention has been a miserable failure,' said Mr Tony Norfield, UK treasury economist at ABN/AMRO bank. 'They have not scared off any speculative trading.' Although later denied, reported comments from Bank of Japan governor Yasushi Mieno about the inability of intervention to 'dictate currency levels' kept the markets bearish. The dollar was lolling below Y100.50 and DM1.5950 when the Fed began the concerted intervention around 1330 GMT by buying dollars for Y100.95. It then followed about ten minutes later by buying the US currency for DM1.6070/80. In the meantime, other central banks had also started to buy the dollar. As many as 17 central banks bought dollars in an effort similar to the group action taken on May 4. The extent of the intervention was understood to be between Dollars 2bn and Dollars 3bn, primarily from the Fed. The central banks briefly turned sentiment towards the dollar, which rose to a high of around DM1.61 and Y101.90. But the action failed to push the dollar above key technical levels which analysts placed at DM1.6250 and Y102.50. 'We have to see the intervention pushing the dollar to these key levels,' said Mr Paul Chertkow, head of global currency research at UBS. 'Without that we would expect the technical aspects of trading to remain bearish.' Mr Chertkow said the central bank move came too late. 'If it had occured last week when the pressure first began, then maybe it would have turned the market,' he said. Sterling had a banner day against the dollar, closing at Dollars 1.5422 from Dollars 1.5386, and rising above the Dollars 1.55 level in after-hours trading. Against the D-Mark, it closed in London at DM2.463, from DM2.4671. A significant drop in the UK current account deficit for the first quarter gave the pound a boost, while the ailing dollar gave sterling further support. In the UK money markets, the Bank of England provided liquidity of Pounds 159m after forecasting a revised shortage of Pounds 650m. The bank provided late assistance of Pounds 390m. In Europe, the D-Mark remained strong against the crosses. Against the French franc, it closed in London at FFr3.425 from FFr3.422 and against the lira, it closed at L984.6 from L982.6. Against the strong Swiss franc, however, the D-Mark closed at SFr0.838, down from SFr0.842.</p>

"We pursue many important common goals on a bilateral,  regional and global basis," Christopher said in his article  published in THE WASHINGTON POST today.    "Our economic interests are also converging," he said,  "China's explosive growth is increasingly attractive to American  exporters and investors."    "We are determined to expand American participation in the  Chinese market. China has an even more significant stake in  open and profitable access to the American market," he added.    Christopher said that the U.S. Administration's foreign  policy stands for open societies as well as open markets and  "this balance shapes our approach toward China."    He said that one of the purposes of his recent trip to  Beijing was to reaffirm U.S. intentions to engage China  constructively on many issues where the interests of the two  countries coincide.</p>

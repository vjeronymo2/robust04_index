			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / International Capital Markets: Nikkei 300 futures fail to find favour Dwindling trading volume in futures contracts on the capitalisation-weighted Nikkei 300 index is causing concern among Japanese financial officials. The Nikkei 300 contract, listed on the Osaka Stock Exchange last February eventually to replace the price-weighted Nikkei 225 index, has failed to attract investor interest. OSE officials are now considering measures to revitalise trading, including a cut in the minimum trading unit. Daily trading volume of the Nikkei 300 futures has been below 10,000 contracts since July 5, when volume hit the lowest level on record at 6,891 contracts. In value terms, daily turnover averaged around Y70bn last month, almost 94 per cent lower than that of the Nikkei 225 futures, also traded on the OSE. The Nikkei 300 was introduced after fierce debate over the negative impact of the Nikkei 225 futures on the main cash market. Some financial authorities claimed that the price-weighted index was easily manipulated, and arbitrage trading between the futures and cash markets was responsible for the volatility in the underlying cash market. In spite of the new contract's launch, most traders and investors have stuck to the more familiar Nikkei 225 futures, and the Nikkei 300 index itself has yet to become a stock market benchmark. Mr Sadakane Doi, chairman of the Japan Securities Dealers' Association, said the securities industry would strive to interest investors in the Nikkei 300 futures, adding that many securities industry executives wanted to nurture the index. Meanwhile, Mr Goro Tatsumi, the association's Osaka representative, called for support from the finance ministry to promote the Nikkei 300 index futures. Earlier this year, the Singapore International Monetary Exchange was given the licensing rights to trade futures and options contracts based on the Nikkei 300 index.</p>

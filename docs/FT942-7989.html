			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Arts: ENO turns up the power - Opera This was the most exciting performance seen at the London Coliseum for many a month. It is said the health of an opera company should be judged by the strength of its revivals. If so, English National Opera is in fine fettle, if it can bring back a production three years old with as much bracing immediacy as Peter Grimes. It dates from 1991, the height of 'powerhouse' arrogance, when every production wore its naked light-bulb with pride. Tim Albery's production of Peter Grimes has the statutory light-bulb, but is surviving proof of the dynamism that lit up the finest work of those years. Even if the brutalism of the sets seems unnecessarily harsh, all that goes on within them is electric, music drama with the power switched up to maximum. Albery treats the opera as a late example of expressionism (Berg's Wozzeck, a great influence on Britten, never seems far away). The people of the borough form the faceless army of society, determined to destroy any individual who does not conform. Peter Grimes is already unhinged at the start and the opera is spent watching him teeter on the edge of the cliff, ready to fall into a bottomless ocean of madness. In the title role, Philip Langridge gives one of the essential operatic portrayals of today. Shame and despair have seeped into every muscle of his body; there are emotions here that Langridge seems to drag up from the pit of Grimes's stomach. Each line of the text is stamped with individuality and he is in good voice. With the conductor David Atherton pushing the music to the brink, the impact is formidable. So far this is a repeat of the cast from 1991. The newcomers this time include Janice Cairns, who does not find the vocal writing for Ellen Orford congenial, but gives the character a more determined personality than usual. Alan Opie is sure and steady as the faithful sea-dog Balstrode. Among the many smaller roles there is not one caricature, be it Ann Howard's fearsome Madame of an Auntie, Susan Gorton playing Mrs Sedley as any nosey Grandma or Alan Woodrow's near-hysterical Bob Boles. It is good news that the BBC is filming the production for future broadcast. There are 12 further performances until June 30. The night before, Curlew River was performed in St Paul's Church as part of the BOC Covent Garden Festival by Music Theatre Ulster, not with anything like the same intensity, though the simplicity of this late Britten score was generally respected.</p>

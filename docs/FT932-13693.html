			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Observer: Cut down to size Why so much fuss about the suddenly reduced stature of Mount Everest, whose previously estimated height of 29,029ft has been whittled down by scientists toting laser meters? True, it might have been worth recording if the loss had been the one of nigh a mile and three quarters implied by the Guardian newspaper in stating the revised height at 20,022ft 7.2in. But the real reduction is only of a couple of yards or so, leaving the Himalayan peak at about 29,022ft. What's more, even at the previous figure, Everest was far from being the world's highest mountain. The same also applies, for that matter, to its usually quoted Kashmiri rival, K2, lately estimated at 28,238ft. All that either of them could claim to be is the tallest above the sea-level in their particular area of the globe - which is a dodgy measure despite being the one conventionally adopted - since how far the sea rises above the land varies from one region of the world to another. At least equally dodgy, of course, is the alternative yardstick of height above the general surface of the earth itself in the locality, by which the island of Hawaii's volcanic Mauna Kea rears up from the ocean bed to 33,476ft, almost 20,000 of which are under water. But even that is dwarfed by the highest in terms of the nearest thing to an absolute measure: the distance of the peak from the centre of the earth. By that gauge, Chimborazo in Ecuador, where sea-level is far higher than at the latitude of the Himalayas, towers about 1 1/3 miles above Everest.</p>

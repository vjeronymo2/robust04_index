			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / International Company News: Kymmene cancels FM1.5bn issue Kymmene, Finland's second largest forestry group, yesterday unexpectedly called off plans to raise more than FM1.5bn (Dollars 307m) in a domestic and overseas share issue. The proceeds would have been used to reduce debt and strengthen the group's balance sheet. Kymmene said the issue of up to 15m shares, originally announced on November 7, had been oversubscribed, but did not reach an acceptable price level. It blamed the 'sensitive situation' in US stock markets and the threat of strikes in the Finnish forestry sector for the price shortfall. It is the second time this year that Kymmene has pulled back from a significant strategic move. In June, it withdrew from merger talks with United Paper Mills, the forestry unit of fellow Finnish company Repola, also over a disagreement on pricing. At the the subsequent share issue launch, Mr Harri Piehl, Kymmene chief executive, said the offer was a 'very significant' step toward strengthening the group's balance sheet and 'providing a firm financial base for our growth'. Finnish analysts said they feared the withdrawal could undermine goodwill towards Kymmene among foreign investors, who were offered up to 12.9m shares. However, Mr Piehl said yesterday Kymmene was not prepared to offer a discount on its share price, which has traded recently in a range of FM122 to FM128. The share price returned to the upper end of that range yesterday following the announcement of the deal's withdrawal. It had dropped sharply on Wednesday. Mr Piehl acknowledged that the issue decision meant Kymmene would lose some capacity to mount acquisitions or make other new investments. Nor would it reach as quickly the 40 per cent equity-to-assets ratio it has set as a minimum target. He insisted, however, that group cashflow and earnings prospects were sufficiently strong to ensure Kymmene would reach that target within the life of the upturn in the forestry industry, expected to peak around 1997. He said Kymmene had based its decision not to concede a discount on this anticipated strong earnings flow. The company would be able to achieve its present strategic development plans and pay down its debt (net debt to equity stands at 210 per cent) without the share issue. Kymmene reported a FM545m pre-tax profit in the first eight months of the year, compared with a (restated) loss of FM337m in the same period in 1993, on sales of FM12.11bn. It forecasts full-year earnings of FM1bn.</p>

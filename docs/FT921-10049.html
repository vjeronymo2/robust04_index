			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Wolseley makes Pounds 95m French buy WOLSELEY, the plumbing equipment distributor, has made its first move into continental Europe with the purchase of the Brossette group, France's largest plumbing supplier. Wolseley, which has already built up a dominant position in the UK and US, will pay FFr931m (Pounds 95.1m) to buy the company from the Brossette family, which started the business in 1841 in Lyon. Mr Jeremy Lancaster, Wolseley's chairman and managing director, said Brossette was almost a carbon copy of Wolseley's UK business and the acquisition would give the company a beach head for later expansion into Europe. 'In our view, you can't go into Europe from the UK without something in France first,' he said. Brossette claims a 12 per cent share of the French plumbing and heating supplies market, according to Mr Pierre Brossette, the main shareholder. Mr Brossette, who will remain president, said he agreed to the sale because there were no family members to inherit the business. Wolseley is paying about 14 times historical earnings for Brossette, which is expected to report profits before tax of at least FFr101.4m for last year. The consideration was satisfied by about Pounds 10m cash and the issue of 21.47m shares at 400p, which were placed yesterday by SG Warburg Securities. Wolseley's shares were steady yesterday, closing up 1p at 414p. The shares fell sharply on Thursday, dropping 14p, apparently ahead of the announcement. Gearing will rise from 20 per cent to between 25 per cent and 30 per cent, reflecting the increased bank borrowing and FFr315m of debt being taken on within Brossette. Brossette has 176 outlets throughout France, more than three times its nearest rival. Last year the company began a small operation in Belgium. Mr Lancaster said the expanded group would also look at Spain and Germany, but only if the right acquisition became available. Brossette has been affected by the recession in the construction industry and by a fall in new housebuilding in France. But profits this year were expected to be steady, reflecting an upturn in renovation work, Mr Brossette said. In October Wolseley reported profits down by nearly a third from Pounds 120.7m to Pounds 80.3m in the year to end-July 1991 due to recession in the US and UK. Mr Lancaster suggested yesterday there had since been little improvement. But he said March and April would provide better pointers for gauging the extent of any upturn. See Lex</p>

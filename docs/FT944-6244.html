			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (What It Means For You): Measures already announced will have the biggest impact - The Institute for Fiscal Studies analyses the effects of the Budget on different sectors of the population The new tax changes announced by the Chancellor today were minimal. Virtually all the changes that will affect people's incomes we knew about even before he stood up. But these pre-announced changes still mean that the incomes of virtually everybody in the country will fall as tax rises come into effect immediately (for excise duties) or in April (for other tax rises). Between them, they will impose an average loss of about Pounds 2.70 per week on households. This comes on top of average losses of nearly Pounds 7 per week which households have already suffered as a result of last year's two Budgets. This year's changes will not be nearly enough to restore a feel-good factor to a nation which, although in recovery, has seen a fall in real personal disposable income in the last year, largely as a result of tax increases. Overall, the new measures will reduce taxes on households very slightly. Without them the average losses would have been about Pounds 2.90 a week not Pounds 2.70. The main beneficiaries will be pensioners who have seen their personal income tax allowances rise by Pounds 430, Pounds 330 more than necessary to account for inflation. For married pensioners this extra personal allowance will be enough almost exactly to compensate them for the pre-announced reduction in the value of the married couple's allowance. In the graphic, overall losses for pensioners are noticeably less than those for other types of households and the generous income tax reduction is partly responsible. Virtually all taxpayers will also benefit from a very small increase in the width of the 20 per cent lower rate band of income tax, which will rise from Pounds 3,000 to Pounds 3,200, Pounds 100 more than necessary to take account of inflation. However the benefit to taxpayers will be a paltry Pounds 5 per year, just 10p a week. For the first time in three Budgets, personal income tax allowances were indexed for inflation, leaving them unchanged in real terms, though the married couple's allowance was again frozen. Also for the first time in several Budgets, the basic rate limit - the point at which the 40 per cent tax rate comes into force - rose with inflation, so higher rate taxpayers were not hit again. The only other change relevant to people's pockets, that had not already been announced, was the freezing of alcohol duties. But given how low inflation is, this will make very little difference to anybody. The biggest changes by far remain those announced last year by Mr Clarke and, in the case of the second tranche of VAT on fuel, by his predecessor Mr Lamont. It is these changes which drive the distributional pictures shown below. The most important remains the second tranche of VAT on domestic fuel, raising it from 8 per cent this year to 17.5 per cent from April. Fuel spending varies very little by income range. On average, the poorest 10 per cent spend only Pounds 4 a week less on fuel than the richest 10 per cent. Consequently a VAT compensation package was announced last year which will mitigate the worst effects on those on the lowest incomes by raising benefits by more than inflation. For pensioners as a group this will in time nearly, but not quite, compensate in full for the imposition of VAT. Last April they received an extra 50 pence a week on the basic pension. Next April they will receive a further 30 pence or so above normal indexation. While other benefit recipients did much less well last year, with single parents and unemployed families with children suffering especially badly, they are hit little harder than pensioners this year. All these groups will be left worse off because of VAT on fuel. The VAT changes and the other indirect tax rises are largely responsible for the losses among the pensioners and the unemployed, who are not much affected by income tax rises. Not only are these groups facing VAT on fuel, but a 3 per cent real increase in tobacco duties and a 5 per cent real increase in petrol duties will hit at least some of them. For richer people the absolute effect of increased petrol duties especially will be greater. Nevertheless the main tax increases that will be felt by the better off will be the two big income tax rises which were announced last year. These were the further restriction in the values of both the married couple's allowance and mortgage interest tax relief (Miras) from 20 per cent to 15 per cent. The MCA restriction will cost every married taxpayer Pounds 86 a year or Pounds 1.65 a week. At current interest rates, the Miras restriction will cost those with mortgages above Pounds 30,000 Pounds 2 a week. These two changes will mean that married people with mortgages are worst hit. Indeed, the graphic shows that married couples in work suffer worse than any other group, with losses of between Pounds 4 and Pounds 5 a week on average. Single wage earners by contrast will lose only Pounds 2 a week. It is not only in absolute terms but also in proportional terms that married wage earners do worst. They will lose up to 1.5 per cent of their disposable income as against just one per cent for single wage earners and rather less than that for pensioners. Looking at the picture for income deciles, or tenths of the population from richest to poorest, the overall impact gives the initial impression of being mildly progressive, with richer deciles losing more in absolute terms than poorer ones. The one exception is the dip between the poorest and second poorest deciles  -the poorest are doing worse than the not quite so poor. This is because the poorest tend to be the unemployed below pension age, while the not-quite-so-poor are largely pensioners who have not done quite so badly as their younger counterparts. The overall impression of progressivity is misleading, however, in so far as progressivity should really be measured in terms of the proportion of people's income which is taken. The absolute tax rise differs by only 60 pence a week between the fourth decile and the richest. So as a proportion of income lost, it is the middle deciles who have done worst, losing 1.4 per cent of their income as against just 0.7 per cent for the richest group and 1 per cent for the poorest decile. This picture has been little affected by any of the new measures. This Budget of Mr Clarke will not be remembered for its effect on people's incomes nor on the distribution of the tax burden. But everybody has still to feel many of the tax rises that he and his predecessor announced last year. Middle income people will feel them most keenly.</p>

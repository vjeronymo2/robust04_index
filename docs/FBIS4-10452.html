			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Luiz Alberto Weber] </F>   [Text] During the government of General Ernesto Geisel  (1974-1979) the "responsible pragmatism" of the Brazilian  Foreign Ministry led Brazil to become one of the pioneers in  recognizing the African socialist regimes of Angola, Mozambique,  Guinea-Bissau, and Cape Verde. Brazil, as an emerging power,  wanted to exert its influence over the Portuguese-speaking  countries that had recently become independent from Portugal.  Almost 20 years later, Itamaraty and a group of Brazilian  businessmen are playing their cards on a South Africa governed  by the African National Congress (ANC) of Nelson Mandela. But  the priorities are different: There is no longer the idea of  projecting Brazilian political influence, but rather that of  doing good business. From 13 to 20 March, just over one month  before the first South African elections in which the black  population will vote, a delegation of 34 Brazilian businessmen  headed by Celso Marcos Vieira, chief of the Trade Promotion  Department of the Foreign Ministry, made a commercial visit to  that country. The Brazilian companies were represented by large  companies such as Andrade Gutierrez, Norberto Odebrecht, Mendes  Junior, NEC of Brazil, Embraer [Brazilian Aeronautics Company],  Varig Airline, Furnas [Furnas Electric Power Plants, Inc.], and  Petrobras [Brazilian Petroleum Corporation]. Vieira said: "The  time could have not been better: With this initiative we showed  confidence in the South African electoral process."    The South African elections, which will put an end to 46  years of white minority government, will be held on 26, 27, and  28 April. Even with the growing political violence of the last  few months, the inauguration of Nelson Mandela on 10 May is  considered a sure thing by analysts, including those of  Itamaraty. The Brazilian delegation got ahead of possible  missions from Europe, the United States, and Japan. According  to Otavio Cardoso Pontes, director-superintendent of  Poliolefinas and one of the members of the Brazilian delegation,  Brazilian businessmen see many possibilities for bilateral trade  with South Africa, which is a country with a high level of  consumption and a well-developed infrastructure. Mandela's  representatives guaranteed the Brazilian businessmen that an  eventual ANC government would not implement a policy promoting  government intervention in the economy, as planned in the party  program.    The Brazilians met with heads of the ANC economic  departments  and with representatives of five different sectors (including  the National Federation of Africa Chamber of Commerce, which  includes only black businessmen) interested in joint ventures  and consultant services. The future for prospective Brazilian  deals in South Africa lies in the reconstruction and development  project that Mandela and his team have drafted. Vieira  commented that "the ANC intends to build 1 million low cost  houses and to expand its electricity supply system. There is  lots of room for Brazilian companies in these areas." Mandela's  supporters, moreover, are willing to review the energy policy  implemented so far by the government. The ANC intends to  minimize the African nuclear program which, it is believed,  includes nuclear bombs.    The ANC leaders are also quite interested in the  establishment of an economic bloc including Mercosur [Common  Market of the South] -- Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay  -- and South Africa, Angola, Mozambique, Tanzania, Zambia, and  Botswana. According to Minister Vieira, Brazil regards South  Africa as a doorway for the entry of Brazilian products into the  African markets. He added: "They know how to negotiate with the  region, and this could be useful to the Brazilian businessmen."    Although the ANC has asserted it does not have any  nationalization program in mind, it has asked to consult  Petrobras [Brazilian Petroleum Corporation] to determine whether  or not it is feasible to maintain the state monopoly in the oil  field. The Bank of Brazil has already opened credit lines with  the purpose of promoting bilateral trade. But the Brazilians'  visit to Mandela's country does not boil down to promises only.  At least one deal worth $3 million has already been closed:  The petrochemical industry Poliolefinas will buy raw material  from a South African company to manufacture polyethylene.  Minister Vieira exclaimed: "We have discovered South Africa."  What remains to be seen is whether Mandela's virtual election  will be enough to guarantee political stability in that country.  After all, Brazil's initiatives in all the Portuguese-speaking  African countries failed because they all were drowned by  endless civil wars.</p>

In a report issued to Congress and also sent to President  Cesar Gaviria, the comptroller indicated that the  Comptrollership's Fiscal Investigations and Trials Directorate  has detected approximately 40 billion pesos worth of shortages  that have not been reimbursed. Of that amount, 27.5 billion  pesos correspond to public institutions and the central  government sector and the rest to government-private capital  enterprises and to state-owned industrial and commercial  enterprises.    The comptroller also indicated that his office will do  everything possible to seize the assets of 1,100 officials who  committed irregularities in handling funds. The report also  demanded that those officials present themselves to the Treasury  to return the funds before the appropriate authorities intervene.    The institutions mentioned include several ministries and  administrative departments. The most often mentioned ministries  are defense, health, education, and finance. [passage omitted]</p>

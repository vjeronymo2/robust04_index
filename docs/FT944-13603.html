			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Australia-NZ 'open skies' cloud over A row has broken out between Canberra and Wellington over liberalising the countries' aviation markets. The Australian authorities are refusing to let Air New Zealand start a domestic service within Australia next month. Under a memorandum of understanding signed by the two in 1992, Air New Zealand was to have gained access to Australia's internal market from November 1. It would have become the third national carrier, competing with Qantas, the government-owned airline in which British Airways holds a minority stake, and Ansett, owned jointly by Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation and TNT. However, Canberra is claiming that all the memorandum's conditions have not been met. It cites the lack of agreement on 'passenger facilitation' arrangements - the idea was that New Zealand and Australia would become borderless and visa and customs checks would be redundant - and on airline ownership and control issues. The Australian authorities said they were not abandoning the proposed liberalisation in principle, but 'freezing' the situation for the present. In the short term, the row could make life easier for Qantas, which is due to be privatised next year. Mr Jim Bolger, New Zealand prime minister, said he was surprised at the way Australia's aviation minister had told New Zealand the agreement was being suspended. 'He advised us by fax. That is not the way to do business,' he said. 'The decision doesn't stack up.' Mr Bolger said that Australia had pressed for an open aviation market between the two countries, and there were signed undertakings to ensure it was carried out. Opposition politicians in Australia also condemned the move, arguing that the government had 'unilaterally torn up' the agreement and that such behaviour would have broader consequences for Australia in international negotiations. Senator Warwick Parer, the opposition's aviation spokesman, said: 'Opponents within Apec (the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation forum) now have a new weapon to use to take Australia out of the game, or, at best, damage our standing as a creditable negotiator and reliable signatory.' The dispute means the Australian government's much-vaunted commitment to 'open skies' looks increasingly hollow. Deregulation of the domestic market has prompted only one new national carrier to take to the skies, and it quickly went out of business. On the international front, passenger choices have also become more limited as big US and European carriers have pulled out of Australia, and no new Australian airlines have emerged. In addition, BA and Qantas are seeking to 'co-ordinate' services on the important UK-Australia routes, although this deal has yet to win Trade Practices Commission approval.</p>

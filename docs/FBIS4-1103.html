			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Rik De Gendt: "OAU Officers in Burundi Await </F> Green Light From Brussels"]    [Excerpts] Brussels -- At the request of the Burundian  Government, 15 OAU officers are ready to begin an investigation  into the continuing skirmishes in the northern Hutu quarters of  the capital Bujumbura. They are being severely hindered from  carrying out this assignment by their lack of necessary  communications equipment and transportation. Meanwhile, 30  Belgian jeeps and radio equipment, which are intended for the  OAU peace mission, are waiting, unused, in a hangar for a  definitive "yes" from Brussels. [passage omitted]    At the cabinet of the Belgian Foreign Ministry, a spokesman  for Willy Claes said that "the talks with the OAU concerning the  specific use of the Belgian equipment had not yet been  concluded, and that consequently Belgium could not yet release  the vehicles in question." A final agreement would be reached  "within a few days, or one week at the latest," he said.    "However, we still have high hopes for the OAU mission,"  Burundian Foreign Minister Jean-Marie Ngendahayo said, speaking  yesterday with DE STANDAARD over telephone. "Both the Army and  the militant elements in the Hutu quarters are accusing each  other of provocation. There is an urgent need for us to gain an  objective picture of the situation."    In addition, Ngendahayo said that it was a "shame that some  reports had exaggerated the previously sporadic disturbances in  some parts of the capital at the very same time that such  intensive, serious efforts are being made to put them behind  us." During the weekend, the Burundian Government again took  measures to strengthen the administration in the tribal areas  and is seeking possible ways of gradually disarming the  population.    The foreign minister was optimistic about the possibilities  envisioned Monday by the Constitutional Court regarding the  succession of country's defunct President Cyprien Ntaryamira.  He said that "relations with the former part of unity, UPRONA  [Unity for National Progress], are so good that a solution to  the menacing constitutional impasse is very close to being  reached."</p>

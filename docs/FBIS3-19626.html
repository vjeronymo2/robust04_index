			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias returned from  Washington at noon today and in a statement referred to the  Greek Government's letter which was given to Cyrus Vance, UN  mediator on The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYROM],  yesterday. Correspondent Nikolaos Meletis reports:    [Begin recording] [Meletis] Ambassador Andonios Exarkhos,  Greece's permanent representative at the United Nations,  yesterday handed Vance the Greek side's reply to the ideas that  the international mediator on FYROM had presented in Geneva.  Returning to Athens at noon today, the foreign minister was  asked about the contents of the letter and about rumors that the  two sides will meet Vance in New York within 10 days.    [Papoulias] No, I did not meet Vance. What I know--and I  believe you know it too--is that the reply was given to Vance.  The letter mentions that Vance's ideas are positive in  principle and may constitute a basis for further talks if [FYROM  President Kiro] Gligorov's intransigence is softened.    [Meletis] Yesterday, Papoulias briefed European Union [EU]  Commissioner Hans van den Broek on the contents of the letter.  He and van den Broek represented the EU at the signing of the  Croat-Muslim agreement in Washington. Van den Broek conveyed  his conclusions from his meeting with Gligorov.    Referring to the issue of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Papoulias  stressed that in its first phase the U.S. effort has been  somewhat successful, but noted the significant role that the EU  is called upon to play.    [Papoulias] At their meeting in Ioannina, the EU foreign  ministers will make significant decisions on the role that the  EU will play in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The U.S. factor and Russia  are certainly welcome, but the EU action plan remains the basis  for finding a viable and peaceful solution in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. [end recording]</p>

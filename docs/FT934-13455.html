			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / International Company News: Lower oil prices restrict Texaco to Dollars 317m WEAKER oil prices and special items restricted third-quarter net income on continuing operations at Texaco to Dollars 317m, or Dollars 1.13 a share, compared with Dollars 325m, or Dollars 1.26 a share, a year before. Including the loss on the sale of the company's chemical business, net income fell to Dollars 142m. Before all one-off items, after-tax earnings were Dollars 255m, down from Dollars 338m the previous year. Mr Alfred DeCrane, chairman and chief executive, said this reflected a 'solid performance' in the face of a Dollars 4 per barrel decline in crude oil prices. Operating earnings from US exploration and production fell from Dollars 193m to Dollars 138m while upstream activities overseas generated Dollars 15m, down from Dollars 98m (both before special items), largely as a result of lower oil prices. Operating income from downstream businesses, on the other hand, rose to Dollars 99m from Dollars 83m in the US and remained flat at Dollars 107m overseas. Texaco also reported special charges of Dollars 235m, stemming from staff reductions, reserves to meet environmental clean-up costs and asset write-downs. These were offset by a Dollars 152m credit due to a change in tax law affecting deferred taxes and a Dollars 145m deferred tax credit related to the sale of an interest in a subsidiary. A loss on the sale of Texaco's chemical operations led to a Dollars 164m charge, along with a Dollars 11m loss for the quarter on the chemical business.</p>

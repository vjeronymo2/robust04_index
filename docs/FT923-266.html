			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Kleinwort to launch China fund A NEW fund investing in unlisted Chinese companies is to be launched this week by Kleinwort Benson Investment Management. China Investment &amp; Development Fund is to be floated in London. Mr Robin Fox, chairman-designate, said: 'We believe the greatest opportunity in China is investment in unlisted China enterprises and not in B shares.' The Shenzhen and Shanghai stock markets have excited interest among foreign investors, who are allowed to buy B shares - A shares are reserved for domestic investors. However, concerns include the high level of prices in Shenzhen, volatility and absence of effective regulation. Though the Communist party shows no sign of relinquishing political control, reforms have opened up large areas of the economy to private investment. The non-state economy accounts for 46 per cent of industrial production and 95 per cent of agricultural output. By the end of last year, more than 34,000 enterprises were using foreign funds, technology or marketing expertise.</p>

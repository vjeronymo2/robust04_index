			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / World Commodities Prices: Coffee futures hold firm - Market Report London Commodity Exchange COFFEE futures held firm in thin trading yesterday as investors looked ahead to today's meeting between the Brazilian officials and coffee growers over the government's plan to sell official stocks. 'Until that's out of the way, no one is prepared to take a view on the market,' one trader said. The July position closed at Dollars 1,496 a tonne, up Dollars 23 but well short of the recent high. There was no reaction to news that the robusta coffee retention indicator had passed the 70 cents-a-pound mark, allowing sales of beans stockpiled under the producer's market support scheme. COCOA prices lost ground in the afternoon. Early industry buying was confined to bargain-hunting and failed to follow prices up, traders said. By the close the July price had retreated from a high of Pounds 888 a tonne to Pounds 874, down Pounds 6 on the day. Base metals trading at the London Metal Exchange remained slow. COPPER ended steadier but with the three months delivery prices below the earlier high of Dollars 1,930 a tonne as a lack of follow-through interest and a downturn in the New York market prompted profit-taking and speculative selling. ALUMINIUM also slipped from earlier highs as resistance and selling emerged towards Dollars 1,300 a tonne for three months delivery. It was last at Dollars 1,291.50, up Dollars 4.50.

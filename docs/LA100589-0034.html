			<p><P> October 5, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> WHO'S HOT  </P> <P> Miraleste's sophomore running backs Dan Sarner and Dan Crofton each rushed for  more than 100 yards for the second consecutive week to lead the Marauders over  Orange Lutheran, 18-14, in an Olympic League football opener.  </P> <P> Midfielder Kristi White of the Cal State Dominguez Hills women's soccer team  (11-0) scored her 11th goal of the season in a 2-1 win over Cal State Hayward  to set a school record with 79 career points.  </P> <P> Wilfred Rodriguez kicked a 46-yard field goal with no time remaining to lift  Narbonne over L.A. Wilson, 23-20, and snap the Gauchos' 23-game losing streak,  the longest skid in the state.  </P> <P> Outside hitter Kerry House led the Loyola Marymount women's volleyball team to  a three-match sweep to open West Coast Conference play, earning WCC Player of  the Week honors. House had 41 kills and 80 digs.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Who's Not  </P> <P> After three games, Inglewood's football team still has not scored a point. The  Sentinels were hammered by Leuzinger, 40-0, last Thursday in a Bay League  opener and have now been outscored, 96-0.  </P> <P> Coast Christian, two-time defending CIF Eight-Man Small Division football  champion, has fallen on hard times. The Saints fell to 0-3-1 following a 47-0  loss to Chadwick last Friday.  </P> <P> Palos Verdes failed to complete a pass in a 20-0 Bay League football loss to  Hawthorne as quarterback Blake Anderson went 0 for 9 with one interception. The  Sea Kings weren't much better on the ground, rushing for 127 yards.  </P> <P> Not even the home-field advantage could help Harbor College's football team  Saturday in a 56-0 loss to Bakersfield. The Seahawks (1-2) fell behind, 27-0,  in the first half as Bakersfield piled up 273 total yards.  </P></p>

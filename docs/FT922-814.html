Directors said the improvement in part reflected action to reduce costs, particularly of raw materials and staffing levels where numbers fell to 1,268 against 1,427 a year earlier. Turnover of the continuing operations slipped from Pounds 53.7m to Pounds 51.3m. Earnings amounted to 1.28p (1.05p) and the interim dividend is a same-again 1.65p.</p>

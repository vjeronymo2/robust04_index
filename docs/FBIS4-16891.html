			<p>BFN     [Text] Some of the South Ossetian citizens have taken the  plans to equip a border post on the Russian-Georgian border as  an attempt to divide the peoples of North and South Ossetia.  According to Interfax sources, about 300 citizens of South  Ossetia (Georgia) have arrived in Vladikavkaz, the capital of  North Ossetia (Russia) to organize a meeting in front of the  parliament building.    The republic leaders persuaded the demonstrators to move to  the Art Center and meet with North Ossetian President Akhsarbek  Galazov. The president said that the most important thing now  was "to work in order to turn Ossetia into an economically  mighty country."    He also said that the North Ossetian leaders would make  efforts to ensure that the Russian-Georgian border between South  and North Ossetia be transparent and never divide the peoples.</p>

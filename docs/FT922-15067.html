			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Appointments: Trimming the shortlist at BAT Martin Broughton, currently BAT Industries senior finance director, is to take over responsibility for BAT's large financial services operation from Brian Garraway who will be retiring later this year. The promotion of Broughton (near right), 44, is part of a streamlining of BAT's top management structure as the older executives led by chairman Sir Patrick Sheehy, and deputy chairman Garraway, prepare to hand over to the next generation. Brian Garraway will retire in October and Sir Patrick, who has been chairman since 1982, is expected to step down sometime next year. Although BAT has yet to name Sheehy's successor, the latest changes have trimmed the shortlist. Broughton, who becomes managing director financial services from July 1, is an obvious contender, as is Ulrich Herter (above right), chairman of BAT Cigarettenfabriken, who becomes managing director, tobacco. Herter, 50, joins the chairman's policy committee, BAT's key executive body, as does David Alvey, 47, BAT's finance director. Unlike Broughton, who joined British-American Tobacco as a travelling auditor in 1971, Herter, a German marketing man, is a relatively recent arrival only joining BAT's German subsidiary in 1984. Having studied economics at Kiel University, he spent his early career with Martin Brinkmann. Bernd Schweitzer, Herter's marketing director, will take over the chairmanship of the German operation. Broughton will succeed Garraway as chairman of Eagle Star and George Greener, the Mars man who was hired as chief executive of Allied Dunbar last September, will take over from Garraway as chairman of Allied Dunbar. Greener also joins the BAT board. ***** Alan Wheatley, the senior London partner of accountancy firm Price Waterhouse, is taking over as chairman of 3i, the UK's biggest provider of long-term capital to small and medium sized businesses. 3i has been looking for a chairman since the beginning of February, when Sir John Cuckney said he would be stepping down at the end of July. The other leading candidate for the chairman's post was Sir David Walker, the chairman of the Securities and Investments Board, but he withdrew from the race last month when he was appointed a deputy chairman of Lloyds Bank. 3i's chairman is chosen by its board and its leading shareholders, which are the Bank of England and the UK clearing banks. Wheatley was Sir John's preferred candidate who got him well in the mid-1980s when Wheatley drafted a business strategy for Westland, the helicopter manufacturer then chaired by Sir John. Wheatley is a non-executive director of British Steel and was a deputy chairman of Cable &amp; Wireless, the telecommunications group, until 1985. He was appointed to the board of 3i last July. ***** Janet Gunn is appointed 3i's human resources director; she moves from SD Scicon.</p>

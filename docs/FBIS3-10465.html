			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by LA NACION special correspondent Eduardo De Simone </F> from Madrid]    [Text] The Argentine Administration hopes that Brazil's  recent economic plan will help shorten the deadlines for  integration within the framework of the Common Market of the  South [Mercosur]. Many people believe that Brazil's new  economic plan will help reduce the economic differences between  that country and Argentina.    The economic plan which Brazilian Finance Minister Fernando  Henrique Cardoso launched had been "continuously discussed" with  the Argentine economic team due to the excellent relations  between the two administrations.    Government officials and businessmen who are attending the  Seminar on Business Opportunities in Argentina and the Mercosur  which will end today in Madrid informally evaluated the  repercussions of Brazil's new economic plan.    Carlos Sanchez, Argentine Economy Ministry secretary for  investments and foreign trade, stated that the implementation of  measures which will put an end to the indexing of Brazilian  economy and will reduce public deficit is very positive.    Sanchez added that concrete effects of these measures will  be  perceived starting next year and Argentina will benefit from  them.    The Argentine economic team believes that the measures  Cardoso has proposed will increase the value of Brazilian  currency and Argentina will benefit from the exchange rate. It  is well-known that Argentina has a large deficit in its trade  with Brazil.    Carlos Leone, chairman of the Argentine Steel Comany Inc.  said: "Brazil's program is positive because the exchange rate  will be more favorable to Argentina. Leone emphasized that  Brazil's decision to curb its fiscal deficit is praiseworthy.    Angel Perversi, vice chairman of the Bunge and Born Company  stated: "This plan is an improvement over what they now have,"  but he chose to be cautious. "Let us wait for results," he  said. In any case, Perversi's advice was that Brazil's changes  should not lull us to sleep. "We should focus on retrofitting  and the changes we can make ourselves," he told LA NACION.    Argentine Industrial Union President Jorge Blanco Villegas  stated: "Trade with Brazil will improve as soon as Brazil  improves." He added: "We hope that Brazil will succeed, although  it is a very complex plan." Villegas emphasized that "there  have been many other programs, all of which have failed."    The truth is that most businessmen who came to Madrid are  still waiting for a change in the economic situation of the main  Mercosur partner. Further negotiations for the establishment of  a common market are fraught with uncertainties which could be  cleared gradually if the new plan works out.    The somewhat lukewarm enthusiasm of government officials and  businessmen moved President Carlos Menem to forecast: "Mercosur  will be beneficial to all American countries, including the  United States."    Everyone is wholeheartedly praying that this is not just  another episode in the comings and goings of regional  integration.</p>

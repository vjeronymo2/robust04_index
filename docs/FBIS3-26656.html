According to estimates of  departments concerned, there was an overall development in  various spheres of production, circulation, distribution,  consumption, and other social reproduction, and there were large  increases in major economic targets compared with those of 1992.    The GNP that reflected the development of social production  reached approximately 3 trillion yuan for the whole year, an  increase of about 13 percent compared with that of 1992.  Industry, agriculture, post and telecommunications, and  transportation achieved rapid growth.    The scale of economic construction expanded, and production  capacity increased. The scale of investments in fixed assets of  the whole society in 1992 reached about 1.13 trillion yuan, an  increase of 49 percent compared with that of 1992, of which the  margin of increase in investments in capital construction and  renovation and transformation of state-owned organizations was  about 60 percent, and a number of key construction projects were  built.    Domestic and foreign markets further expanded, and the total  volume of domestic and foreign trade greatly increased. The  total amount of social commodity retail sales at home for the  whole year reached about 1.35 trillion yuan, an increase of  about 23 percent compared with that of 1992, the fastest  increase in recent years. The total amount of import and export  trade reached about 192 billion dollars, an increase of about 16  percent compared with that of the previous year.    Social financial resources increased by a margin. The  situation of state revenue was better than that of the previous  year. It was estimated that revenue for the whole year would  exceed budget. There were large increases in extra-budgetary  revenue and expenditure calculated by comparable requirements  compared with those of the previous year. As the residents'  savings and various kinds of deposits continued to grow, the  scale of bank loans was estimated to increase by about 20  percent compared with that of 1992.    The living standard of the people was further raised and  improved. Gross wages increased by about 21 percent compared  with those of the previous year. The average wages of staff and  workers grew by about 20 percent. There were some increases in  the peasants' income following the growth of production and  improvement in the work of purchasing agricultural products.  <H3>  II. Development Depends on Reform and Opening-Up and  Macroeconomic Regulation and Control </H3>   The reform of the transformation of operational mechanism of  state-owned enterprises in China in the year 1993 was further  intensified. China made the best use of time to implement the  "Provision Regarding the Transformation of Operational Mechanism  of Industrial Enterprises of Ownership by the Whole People,"  started carrying out the reform of the property rights system  and its form of operation, thus strengthening the market  principal position of enterprises, and took the first step  toward building the system of modern enterprises.    Pricing reform has made new development in the stage of  storming fortifications. Over 90 percent of the counties  (cities) in China have lifted restrictions on the selling prices  of grain and edible oil, and on ex-factory prices of iron and  steel products and some kinds of coal successively, increased  railway freight transport prices, carried out agency prices of  important commodities, and further expanded the role of market  mechanism.    The reform of government organizations was pushed ahead, the  intervention by the government in enterprise operations was  weakened, and the functions of macroeconomic management were  strengthened.    New progresses were made in other fields of reform, such as  the rural reform, the social insurance system reform, and the  housing system reform.    The high-speed economic development in 1993 was achieved due  to China's further expansion of opening to the outside world.  There appeared new high tides of drawing foreign investments in  1993. Nearly 70,000 projects of investments by foreign  businessmen were approved in the whole year, more than double  that of the previous year, and direct investments by foreign  businessmen actually drawn amounted to approximately 18 billion  dollars, registering an increase of over 60 percent compared  with those of the previous year. The rate of technological  import quickened. The number of technological import contracts  signed during the year increased by about 40 percent compared  with that of the previous year, and a greater number of modern  technological equipment and new raw and processed materials were  imported. Moreover, open districts in China further increased,  which created a new open pattern of multiple levels, multiple  channels, and multiple directions.    At the end of 1992 and in the first few months of 1993, some  phenomena of overheating and confusion of economic order  appeared in China's economic development, and the CPC Central  Committee and the State Council adopted a number of measures for  strengthening and improving macroeconomic regulation and  control, which reduced the temperature of the real estate fever,  the development zone fever, and the fever of fundraising by  stocks that affected the overall situation, and relaxed the  overall tension of funds and materials. Inflation was curbed to  some extent, and the economy rapidly embarked on the track of  high-speed and healthy development.  <H5>  III. Problems That Admit No Negligence Still Exist </H5>   In 1993, China made achievements in the development of the  national economy that attracted worldwide attention, but there  were also problems that admitted no negligence.    First, the situation of imbalance in the total amount of  supply and demand still existed. After the strengthening of  macroeconomic regulation and control, the imbalance took a  favorable turn, but the balance of general supply larger than  general demand for the whole year still deviated from the  basically normal range. It was mainly due to the fact that the  scale of fixed assets investments in the first half of the year  grew by as high as 61 percent. Although there was certain  control in the second half of the year, it still stayed at 40  percent. Therefore, the investment scale for the whole year  still grew by 49 percent compared with that of the previous  year. Moreover, there were excessive increases in some regions  and among some strata, which exceeded the growth of production.  In addition, there was an imbalance between import and export,  and the deficit of import larger than export was too great.    Second, structural contradictions still stood out sharply.  It was mainly caused by a decrease in agricultural input, and  little improvement in the conditions of agricultural production.  Therefore, agriculture still could not meet the requirements of  high-speed development of the national economy. Energy and  communications remained extremely tense, the proportion of  investments in these fields decreased, and certain processing  industries were still developing too rapidly.    Third, the increase margin of commodity prices remained  somewhat high. After the strengthening of macroeconomic  regulation and control in mid-1993, the price rises tended  toward relaxation, but the impact caused by excessive monetary  issue in the first half of the year still played a delaying  effect. Therefore, the retail prices still increased by about  13 percent for the whole year, which lowered somewhat the actual  living standard of a number of staff and workers.    Fourth, the economic performance of enterprises was still  poor. The economic performance of enterprises was gradually  improved after the second half of 1991, but a declining trend  again in 1993. It found expression in the reduction of profits  realized by enterprises, the expansion of the extent of losses,  and the decline in the composite indexes of industrial economic  performance.    Fifth, financial difficulties were not essentially overcome.  The proportion of revenue in the GNP still decreased.  <H5>  IV. Prospects of Economic Development in 1994 </H5>   If we make an analysis based on the present situation, there  are undoubtedly many favorable conditions for speeding up  economic development in China: 1) The implementation of the  "Decisions" adopted by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC  Congress and the in-depth study of Volume 3 of the  Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping will inevitably  promote greatly the growth of the economy. 2) The  strengthening and improvement in macroeconomic regulation and  control, and the consolidation of the economic order have  created favorable macroeconomic environment and microeconomnic  basis for speeding up economic development. 3) The stock in  storage is quite abundant. 4) There have been some improvements  year by year in the conditions of communications and  transportation and post and telecommunications. 5) With the  growth of production and improvement in enterprise management,  the decline in economic performance is taking a favorable turn,  and it is estimated that there will be some increases in  enterprise retained profits and state revenue. Moreover, the  residents' income increases year by year, plus the development  of banking business and improvement in work, the source of  credit funds will further expand. All these will become  important factors for speeding up economic development. 6) The  international environment is favorable, China's opening to the  outside world will further expand, the complementarity of  international exchange is strengthened, and investments in China  will further increase. Therefore, it is entirely possible to  achieve a sustained, high-speed, and healthy development of the  economy. It is an optimum rate to achieve a 9-10 percent GNP  increase over 1993.    However, to achieve a sustained, high-speed, and healthy  growth, it is still required to do painstaking work: First,  conscientiously implement various reform measures introduced in  1994, carry them through to the end, and guard against the  phenomena of being slack and losing shape. Second, while  continuing to maintain a basic balance in the total amount of  social supply and demand, it is necessary to concentrate efforts  on industrial restructuring, to strengthen agriculture in  particular, and increase input in agriculture. It is necessary  to ensure energy, communications, the production of raw and  processed materials in shortage, the funds for construction, and  the need for materials, and to continue the policies of limiting  the production, and allowing the closing down, suspension, and  bankruptcy of over-supplied products and long-term trades.  Third, try hard to improve enterprise economic performance.    The key is that enterprises should use their "inner skill,"  and change their operational methods of purely relying on  blindly expanding production and price increases. Moreover, it  is necessary to strengthen the technological transformation of  enterprise equipment and the renewal of products, and to rely on  technological progress to promote performance improvement.  Fourth, speed up the coordinated development of social  undertakings and the economy, and give better play to the role  of science, education, culture, and other social undertakings in  economic development. Fifth, while speeding up the growth of  coastal areas, develop more rapidly the economy of the interior  and outlying areas, and narrow the gap of development between  regions. Sixth, continue to do a good job in macroeconomic  regulation and control, and it is especially necessary that we  should make new progress in strengthening the capacity of  macroeconomic regulation and control, improving the regulation  and control system, and giving play to various means of  regulation and control.</p>

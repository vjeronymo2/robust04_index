			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Dublin cool on Mayhew plan for talks The Irish government yesterday gave a cool response to proposals sent to Dublin at the weekend by Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary. Its stance underlined the differing emphases of the two governments over the next step to be taken in the Ulster peace process. Dublin is not planning an immediate response to the British government's latest proposals to renew round-table talks in Northern Ireland, but will make its own suggestions 'for additional areas of discussion' in the coming weeks. Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, described Sir Patrick's proposals as 'a checklist of relevant points in relation to the recommencement of talks', and emphasised that any new talks must be on the basis of the joint declaration and the three-strand talks that broke up without agreement in November 1992. Unease with the latest British proposals, which outline the creation of a new assembly in Northern Ireland, was underlined by a Dublin spokesman who said the Irish government 'will be making suggestions for additional areas of discussion'. Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, said that next week's UK-Irish summit in London will review progress on the joint declaration. The British and Irish prime ministers are due to meet on February 19 to attend the England-Ireland rugby match at Twickenham, and it is expected that Sir Patrick and Mr Spring will also be involved in the discussions. Ulster unionists last night reacted angrily to the news that Sir Patrick had already provided Dublin with the ideas he wants pursued. Mr Peter Robinson, the Democratic Unionist MP for east Belfast, said the disclosure that Britain had given details of its latest thinking to Dublin was an 'outrage' .</p>

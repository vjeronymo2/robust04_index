			<p><P> April 26, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FREEWAY LEAGUE BASEBALL;  </P> <P> STREAKING TROY WINS SIXTH IN A ROW  </P> <P> Troy High School scored its runs in pairs Wednesday, gaining its sixth  consecutive victory with an 8-3 decision over Sonora to remain in first place  in the Freeway League.  </P> <P> Troy (10-8, 7-3) had 11 hits, with leadoff batter Steve Freidrich getting three  hits, scoring twice, driving in two runs and stealing a base.  </P> <P> Left-hander Guy Pinelli (5-2) settled down after a shaky start to shut out  Sonora (9-9, 5-5) in the final five innings. Pinelli was called up from junior  varsity three weeks ago when Troy ace Greg Windell developed tendinitis in his  pitching shoulder.  </P> <P> "I assumed a left-hander was going to be our ace this year, but I thought it  was going to be Windell," said Dane Illertsen, Troy's coach. "Guy has done a  great job since coming up from the JVs."  </P> <P> Troy provided Pinelli with plenty of offense, scoring two runs in the first,  third, fifth and sixth innings against Scott Oxarart (4-6).  </P> <P> Third baseman Matt Carter hit a two-run home run in the first and Freidrich  added a two-run home run in the sixth as Troy nearly equalled its season home  run total of three.  </P> <P> Sonora Coach John Link said Troy is playing the best baseball in the league  down the stretch.  </P> <P> "The way they're playing now, nobody will catch them," Link said. "When they  beat Buena Park twice after spring break, they served notice that they're the  team to beat."  </P> <P> Freidrich, a junior who is a converted center fielder playing catcher, has the  speed and power that should have scouts lining up to watch him play next  season.  </P> <P> "He'll be one of the best players in the county next year, no matter where he's  playing," Illertsen said. "He's the best athlete on the team and can play any  position. We didn't have a catcher, so he volunteered. It's a good position for  him because he stays involved in every play."  </P> <P> Designated hitter Chris Case also had a big game for Troy, getting three hits  and driving in a run in the fifth when the Warriors took a 6-3 lead. Brad  Keays, Sonora's top hitter, had two hits and walked once.  </P></p>

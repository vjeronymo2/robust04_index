			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / French students protest against plan to lower young people's pay Some 10,000 French students marched through Paris yesterday in protest against a law allowing employers to pay young workers less than the minimum wage as trade union leaders pressed the prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur, for concessions, Reuter reports from Paris. The communist-led CGT union walked out of round-table talks with Mr Balladur after three hours when the conservative prime minister refused to withdraw the controversial law, but non-communist unions continued to negotiate in the hope of winning key changes. The CGT general secretary, Mr Louis Viannet, said: 'The prime minister made a number of proposals which are no more than cosmetic changes. In these conditions the CGT cannot condone the talks.' Mr Viannet later joined the front rank of the protest march, along with student union leaders, near Mr Balladur's Paris office. The law, disapproved of by most French voters according to an opinion poll, allows young people under 26 on 'training contracts' to be paid between 30 and 80 per cent of the minimum wage, known as the SMIC, even if they have university diplomas. The talks with unions and employers to discuss ways of combating record 12.2 per cent unemployment were arranged before controversy erupted last week over what unions and left-wing political parties have dubbed the 'Youth-SMIC'. 'This protest is just a foretaste,' student leader Philippe Campinchi said. 'The aim is to organise a national demonstration in the coming days to demand the scrapping of this law.' Mr Marc Blondel, leader of the moderate Force Ouvriere union, who stayed in the talks, said Mr Balladur had offered amendments to limit the application of the contracts, make them experimental and ensure that young people were given real training. 'There can be no question of the unions, and particularly Force Ouvriere, accepting this notion of a Youth-SMIC,' he said. Mr Viannet said the measure undermined the minimum wage - which currently stands at FFr5,886 (Pounds 674) a month for a 39-hour week. Mr Balladur has denied the measure discriminates against young workers or subverts the minimum wage. With his credibility at stake after several recent policy reverses, the prime minister has vowed he will not back down.</p>

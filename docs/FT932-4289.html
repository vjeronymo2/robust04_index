			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / Victory for gun control lobby CONNECTICUT'S Senate yesterday narrowly voted to ban the sale of assault weapons in the state, marking the third legislative victory for gun control advocates in the US this year. Governor Lowell Weicker immediately signed the bill, which bans the sale of 63 rapid-fire semi-automatic weapons such as AK-47s and Uzis. The bill even prohibits the Colt Sporter, made by Connecticut-based Colt Industries. The manufacturer has been controlled by the state pension funds since its near-bankruptcy in 1990. National gun control legislation is expected to be introduced soon in Congress: polls show that voters overwhelmingly favour the imposition of a five-day waiting period for handgun purchases, and a recent Harris poll suggested a slim majority for an outright ban on possession of handguns. Connecticut followed New Jersey and Virginia in voting for gun controls.</p>

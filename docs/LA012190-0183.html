			<p><P> January 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEDIA SKEPTICISM GREW AS MCMARTIN CASE LINGERED;  </P> <P> NEWS ANALYSIS  </P> <P> Mike Wallace wanted to interview Ray Buckey for "60 Minutes."  </P> <P> Danny Davis, Buckey's attorney, had instructed his client to refuse all  interview requests since he'd been arrested almost three years earlier. But  Davis said yes to Wallace. The prestige and exposure of the "60 Minutes" forum  was too great to resist, especially at a time when Davis had concluded that the  public might finally be ready to take a more "rational" look at the McMartin  Pre-School molestation case than it had previously.  </P> <P> "We had passed what I considered to be the hysteria of classic witch hunts,"  Davis says.  </P> <P> Wallace's interview with Buckey (and five of the six other original McMartin  defendants) was broadcast on Nov. 2, 1986. Although Wallace and his producer,  Lowell Bergman, have insisted that their story was balanced and fair, it  actually provided "the defense's most compassionate argument to date," as Ray  Richmond wrote in the Herald Examiner at the time.  </P> <P> Richmond called the "60 Minutes" story "card-stacking at its most shameless."  </P> <P> Even Davis said, happily, that the program was "one-sided . . . wholly  sympathetic to the defense point of view."  </P> <P> "I thought they were very gentle on him (Buckey). . . . . Mike Wallace didn't  go after him," Davis says.  </P> <P> Wallace and "60 Minutes" enjoy being controversial and iconoclastic, but by  late1986, they weren't alone in their skepticism about the McMartin case The  district attorney had dismissed all charges against five of the seven original  defendants 10 months earlier, and several other events had combined to arouse  skepticism among many reporters covering the case -- even those initially  convinced that all the defendants were guilty.  </P> <P> It is not uncommon, of course, for some in the media to develop a contrarian  view on any major story after a time, if only out of boredom or annoyance with  the conventional wisdom -- or a desire to break from the pack. But a  three-month Times investigation of McMartin coverage, completed before the  verdicts were announced Thursday, shows that there was more involved in the  growing McMartin skepticism than just the predictable next step in normal  big-event coverage.  </P> <P> For one thing, this story had dragged on so long that reporters were eager for  a new angle; others may have felt guilty about their early lack of skepticism  and may have been eager to redeem themselves.  </P> <P> More important, several reporters say they began to seriously question the  legitimacy of the prosecution's case once they had actually interviewed one or  more of the original defendants face-to-face.  </P> <P> Ross Becker of KCBS-TV and Norma Meyer, then with the Daily Breeze and now with  Copley News Service, both said they thought defendants Betty Raidor and Mary  Ann Jackson were innocent after interviewing them. Jess Marlow, then with KCBS  and now with KNBC, says he felt the same way after interviewing Peggy Ann  Buckey.  </P> <P> That raised questions in reporters' minds about the guilt of other defendants  as well.  </P> <P> Widespread journalistic skepticism developed more gradually, though, as events  unfolded.  </P> <P> Several of these events came during the preliminary hearing, which ran from  mid-1984 until early 1986. The testimony of the children on several bizarre  allegations -- Satanic rituals, animal sacrifices, visits to a cemetery,  molestations in a car wash and a market -- raised many journalistic eyebrows.  </P> <P> Suggestion of Guilt  </P> <P> At the beginning of the case, reports of such charges -- the more bizarre the  better -- seemed to suggest that the defendants must be guilty; after all, who  could (or would) invent such wild fantasies? By the end of the preliminary  hearing, reports of these charges -- which had become even more bizarre --  seemed to suggest that the defendants must be innocent; after all, who could  believe such wild fantasies?  </P> <P> Reportorial doubts were also aroused by the courtroom playing of taped  interviews during which the children's original accusations often seemed to be  made in response to leading and suggestive questions asked by social workers at  Children's Institute International. (As it turned out, those interviews played  perhaps the major role in influencing the jurors to acquit the final two  defendants.)  </P> <P> Disclosures about the hurried, inadequate early investigation of the case under  then-Dist. Atty. Robert H. Philibosian, combined with the failure of the  prosecution to produce a "smoking gun," elicited even more doubt.  </P> <P> "I'd always assumed the smoking gun would be a photo," Marlow says. "Porno gets  passed around."  </P> <P> But the preliminary hearing produced no photos, none of the secret tunnels or  doors or rooms the children had mentioned, no adult witnesses who saw a child  being molested, no defendant willing to condemn the others in exchange for  leniency or immunity -- no irrefutable evidence of any kind.  </P> <P> "You could see the coverage take a definite turn . . . toward the end" of the  preliminary hearing, says Faye Fiore, who covered the hearing for the Daily  Breeze and now works for The Times.  </P> <P> Then, in September, 1985, Fiore herself dropped a bombshell. She wrote that two  of the three McMartin prosecutors thought charges should be dropped against  five of the seven original defendants. Four months later, Dist. Atty. Ira  Reiner -- who had defeated Philibosian at the polls -- did just that.  </P> <P> "Reiner's decision . . . certainly was a turning point," says Gregory Mooney,  an attorney who represented many McMartin parents in some legal proceedings.  "Coverage started to get progressively negative" toward the prosecution after  that, he says.  </P> <P> Prosecutors, parents and their other supporters agree.  </P> <P> Time magazine described the various charges in the case, then raised the  "chilling possibility . . . that none of it had happened at all." Newsweek said  that, "increasingly, there have been questions whether the . . . case was  anything more than a series of sensational headlines."  </P> <P> Most local newspaper and television coverage was less judgmental than that, but  skepticism was clearly afoot. Reporters who decided that most (or all) of the  McMartin defendants were innocent insist they did not let their new views  unfairly influence their stories; it just seemed that way to the prosecution,  they say, because the prosecution was accustomed to having the media report its  side, virtually unchallenged.  </P> <P> L.A. Magazine  </P> <P> For the most part, a reading of the coverage tends to confirm that view. But  there were a number of exceptions, one of the most notable being a story in Los  Angeles magazine last October.  </P> <P> The story was written by Mary A. Fischer, who -- 10 months earlier, in the same  magazine -- had been the first to chronicle the media's growing skepticism  about the case. Her basic thesis in the second article was that all the  McMartin defendants were innocent, that the charges had been "trumped up," that  "there never was any case at all."  </P> <P> Fischer says she knows "for sure" that there were no molestations at McMartin.  She has written about the case for at least five publications and discussed it  on television; it's clear that vindication of the defendants became something  of a crusade for her.  </P> <P> "I feel that most reporters on this case believe the defendants to be  innocent," Fischer says, "but they are hamstrung by the conventions, the  techniques of accepted journalism practices. . . . For the sake of balance --  get the defense side, get the prosecution side -- the truth wasn't getting out.  I wanted to risk the loss of some balance to get the truth out."  </P> <P> (In the process of getting "the truth" out, Fischer violated one of Judge  William Pounders' primary concerns throughout the trial -- safeguarding the  privacy of the McMartin children. Although various media had inadvertently  mentioned one or two of the children by his or her real first name -- instead  of "John Doe" or "Jane Doe," as was usually the practice -- Fischer's story was  accompanied by a chart that gave the first names of all 11 children involved in  the trial; between the chart and the story, there was enough information to  identify one child's last name as well.)  </P> <P> As Fischer says, many other reporters did indeed come to believe that the  defendants were innocent, and that was sometimes evident in their stories, too  (although not nearly as evident or as widespread as reporters' earlier feelings  that the defendants were guilty).  </P> <P> Most reporters who covered the case on a daily basis said in interviews several  weeks before the verdicts came in that if the press corps were the jury, the  defendants would not be convicted. Virtually all said they thought Peggy  McMartin Buckey was not guilty, and most thought Ray Buckey not guilty either.  </P> <P> This marked quite a turnaround from the early weeks and months of the case,  when the media covered the case with "an absolute presumption of guilt" for all  seven original defendants, in the words of Nancy Hill-Holtzman, who covered  much of McMartin for the Herald Examiner and now works for The Times.  </P> <P> In fairness, it must be pointed out that there were a few -- not many, but a  few -- attempts to treat the defendants as human beings, not monsters, early  on.  </P> <P> The Herald Examiner, for example, published a lengthy excerpt from Virginia  McMartin's diary seven weeks after the case broke and published brief profiles  on the defendants a month after that. The Herald Examiner editorial page was in  the vanguard of the skeptics, raising questions as early as December, 1984, in  an editorial headlined "A modern witch hunt?" (The Herald contributed its share  to the hysteria and made its share of errors, too; the paper even misspelled  the name of the judge in the preliminary hearing eight times in two weeks.)  </P> <P> A week after the Herald Examiner profiles, The Times published a lengthy Page 1  story on the defendants, based on interviews with 60 of their friends,  relatives, acquaintances and attorneys. The picture that emerged from those  interviews, the story said, was of "a group of people who shared not only a  love of children but a morality that went beyond once-a-week churchgoing."  </P> <P> Once the initial hysteria began to give way to more sober reporting, two other  newspapers -- both in the South Bay area -- frequently provided noteworthy  coverage.  </P> <P> The Daily Breeze, based in Torrance, is the local daily newspaper for those  most directly involved in the McMartin case, so it is no surprise that the  Breeze has published more than 700 stories on the case over the last six years,  more than any other publication.  </P> <P> At first, the Breeze had been as caught up in the early hysteria as the rest of  the media, displaying no skepticism about the sweeping nature of the charges  and publishing the names of uncharged suspects. In addition, the Breeze  published two stories by Faye Fiore on its front page in March, 1985, under the  headline "In Search of Satan"; the stories linked McMartin (and other child  molestation cases) to widespread satanic rituals and devil worship -- charges  never proved.  </P> <P> Norma Meyer, who covered the first six months of the case for the Breeze (and  the last six months for Copley News Service), includes her own stories in her  criticism that the press generally "became mouthpieces for the prosecution."  </P> <P> But Forrest Latiner, the deputy public defender who represented  </P> <P> Peggy Ann Buckey until all charges against her were dropped, says it was Fiore  who "first began to sense there was something not quite kosher about what was  going on."  </P> <P> As a defense attorney, Latiner would be expected to praise a reporter whom the  prosecution accuses of having been biased against them. Even Danny Davis, Ray  Buckey's attorney, says Fiore "wrote stories sympathetic to our side." Many  McMartin parents and their supporters agreed; they picketed the Breeze in  December, 1984, to protest the paper's "pro-defense" coverage.  </P> <P> In one story, Fiore wrote that "many reporters" saw continuing charges by  parents of widespread child molestations in the South Bay as "one of several  desperate attempts to keep alive in the media allegations that have died in the  courtroom" -- a premature judgment at best since the preliminary hearing wasn't  even over yet.  </P> <P> "I think Faye propagandized a fair amount," says Wayne Satz, who broke the  first McMartin story on KABC-TV.  </P> <P> Fiore concedes that she came to believe "the case . . . has no foundation," but  she insists her reporting remained fair and evenhanded. Several other reporters  on the case -- including Marcia Chambers, who covered parts of the case for the  New York Times -- praise Fiore's work on McMartin.  </P> <P> "Faye Fiore is a very good reporter," Chambers says.  </P> <P> Defendants' Side Told  </P> <P> Good or biased -- or a bit of both -- it's clear that Fiore's skepticism led  her to write some of the earliest stories giving the defendants' side of the  case. One of these, a Page 1 story published on Sept. 7, 1984 -- seven months  after the case broke in the news but 2 1/2 years before the trial would begin  -- asked whether it was possible for the defendants to receive a fair trial.  </P> <P> "In one sense," Fiore wrote, the teachers had "already been tried; the media  were their courtroom, the public their jury and guilty is the verdict."  </P> <P> Fiore quoted several of the defendants and their attorneys at length and spoke  of the threats, ostracism and deprivation they had endured -- including lengthy  imprisonment without bail, "a constitutional right more commonly revoked in  death penalty cases."  </P> <P> Fiore and other Breeze reporters wrote more stories from the defendants'  perspective than reporters for any other daily paper, and that helped  contribute to the impression in many quarters that they and their paper became  biased in favor of the defendants.  </P> <P> The Breeze published early interviews with several of the defendants; a profile  of Ray Buckey; stories showing the devastating financial and emotional toll the  case had taken on the defendants, and a story on attempts by various political  candidates to exploit the case for their electoral advantage.  </P> <P> The Breeze also published several major exclusives on McMartin, including one  disclosing that the district attorney's office had interviewed only one-third  of the children before filing charges and another -- one of the biggest stories  in the entire case -- revealing that two McMartin prosecutors had doubts about  the case.  </P> <P> Moreover, unlike most of the media, the Breeze often followed its stories on  various prosecution charges with stories that showed when those charges had not  been substantiated.  </P> <P> Most of the media carried stories in early March, 1984, for example, saying  that authorities armed with search warrants had visited 11 locations in three  counties, looking for evidence linking the McMartin school to a child  pornography ring. But the Breeze was the only news organization among the major  players on McMartin that published a story the next day saying no such evidence  had been found.  </P> <P> Similarly, while most of the media published and broadcast allegations that  children at McMartin and the Manhattan Ranch Pre-School had been swapped for  purposes of molestation, it was the Breeze that subsequently reported the  courtroom exchange in which it was conceded that there was no evidence of a  connection between the molestation cases at the two schools.  </P> <P> Such stories were favorable to the defense, of course, and it could be argued  that that's why the Breeze published them. But they were legitimate stories,  and the reporters deny any bias.  </P> <P> Provocative Stories  </P> <P> In many ways, the most interesting -- certainly the most provocative --  coverage of the McMartin case has come not in a mainstream daily newspaper but  in an alternative weekly, the Easy Reader, in Hermosa Beach.  </P> <P> Early stories in the Easy Reader were so strident in their presumption of guilt  that Kevin Cody, the 40-year-old publisher of the paper, was besieged by angry  friends of the defendants, demanding that he do something about John Jackson,  the reporter/columnist covering the case.  </P> <P> "They said, 'Kevin, you've lived in this town for 15 years. How could you  possibly think that they were running trainloads of molested kids in and out of  that school?' " Cody recalls.  </P> <P> Cody's response was that Jackson was "the best reporter I've ever had, and he's  doing a great job . . . as far as I know."  </P> <P> But when Jackson left the paper, and Cody began covering the case himself, he  came to believe that the prosecution didn't have "any case whatsoever."  </P> <P> Given that view -- and the very nature of alternative newspapers -- it  shouldn't have shocked anyone that Cody's stories began to take a very  critical, at times crusading, look at the prosecution's case. Cody even went so  far as to compare Ray Buckey with Alfred Dreyfus, the French army officer  wrongfully convicted of treason and imprisoned on Devil's Island in 1894.  </P> <P> But Cody also wrote a number of balanced, insightful stories -- including the  most detailed profile of Buckey and the best coverage in any publication of the  complex, controversial, contradictory medical testimony in the case.  </P> <P> The medical testimony was the only real evidence in the case apart from the  children's testimony, but for most of it, no reporters were even in the  courtroom. In fact, the courtroom was often empty of reporters at several  stages of the trial; reporters -- and their editors -- seemingly grew weary of  the case.  </P> <P> Cody probably spent more time in the courtroom during the trial than any other  reporter, though, sitting in the last row of the spectator section, taking  notes on his small, laptop computer, and many journalists -- among them, Satz  of KABC and Furnell Chatman of KNBC -- praise his coverage.  </P> <P> Satz, who is widely perceived as having been pro-prosecution in his own  coverage (a charge he vigorously denies), says Cody provided the "most  thoroughgoing and careful observation of the trial.  </P> <P> "He's trying to be fair in an exemplary way and, to a significant extent, he's  succeeded," his "pro-defense tilt" notwithstanding, Satz says.  </P> <P> Both Satz and Chatman say Cody's coverage is particularly noteworthy given the  relatively meager resources of his newspaper.  </P> <P> Tellingly, however, some of the best individual stories on McMartin appeared in  media far from Southern California. Perhaps that's because publications outside  the area, not burdened with having to cover the story virtually every day, had  more perspective. Equally telling, most of the best McMartin stories were  published relatively late in the case -- perhaps, several local reporters  suggest, because editors outside Southern California were neither too tired of  the daily drone of McMartin coverage over the years nor too embarrassed by  their early coverage to consider a fresh approach late in the proceedings.  </P> <P> Regardless, both Superior Court Judge William Pounders and former Dist. Atty.  Philibosian praise, in particular, Robert Safian's 8,400-word McMartin story  that appeared last October in the American Lawyer, a New York-based magazine.  Safian used the context of 10 days during the trial to sum up and analyze the  entire case in an evenhanded but compelling manner. The story concluded by  saying that, regardless of the verdict, "the McMartin mystery will remain."  </P> <P> "How could so many children be sexually abused for so long without anyone  noticing? On the other hand, how could so many children be convinced that such  terrible things had happened to them if they hadn't? There are too many  inconsistencies in the prosecution's case not to provide lingering doubts. Yet  there is too much conviction and horror in the children's stories of abuse not  to look askance at Ray Buckey. The true believers of either side will hold  firm, and make powerful arguments with compelling evidence. The rest of us will  have to wonder."  </P> <P> Cynthia Gorney of the Washington Post spent three months putting together a  comprehensive, moving, two-part series on the case in the spring of 1988; when  she was done, she, too, was still wondering.  </P> <P> Gorney ultimately decided that "something real and scary" had happened to the  McMartin children; she generally agreed with one of three theories she  presented in her story -- that "some children were molested in Manhattan Beach,  molested by preschool teachers or by others, and . . . the disclosing and  spreading of those children's reports took place in an atmosphere of such  uncontainable and self-feeding alarm that both children and the adults  listening to them lost the capacity to sort the imagined from the actual."  </P> <P> A Quagmire  </P> <P> But Gorney said that almost any development in the case would not surprise her,  and she called the McMartin story "a bigger enigma and a bigger quagmire than  anything any reporter I know has ever gotten into. You lose any sense of what's  real and what's not real. You become . . . disoriented and bewildered.  </P> <P> "I never in my life . . . wanted to get so far from a case as I did from that  one," she says. "I was a basket case while I was doing this thing."  </P> <P> Shirley Downing of the Memphis Commercial Appeal said much the same thing after  she and Tom Charlier spent seven months researching and writing a six-part  series, later reprinted in a 26-page special section, analyzing  child-molestation cases from Memphis to McMartin.  </P> <P> "This is probably the worst story I've ever had to work on," Downing says.  "Neither of us has wanted to write anything else on the subject since then."  </P> <P> The series Downing and Charlier produced -- titled "Justice Abused: A 1980s  Witch-Hunt" -- was among the most skeptical in any mainstream publication. They  pointed out, among many other things, the large number of child molestation  cases that had resulted in dismissals, acquittals and dropped charges and the  startling number of similarities among many of the cases. Children in both the  Memphis and McMartin cases, for example, told of druggings, of animal  mutilations, of trips in vans, of bloody rituals, of sacrifices of babies and  of being taken on airplanes that resembled those of Federal Express.  </P> <P> Downing says she had written about child sexual abuse before this series and "I  really believe that the issue of child sexual abuse is a serious issue, that  children are abused, that horrible things happen, that we have not only a right  but an obligation to try to protect children." But she came to believe that  media coverage of many of these cases had thoroughly "contaminated" the  process.  </P> <P> As good as all of these stories were, they were exceptions. No local media did  enterprise stories on McMartin of the depth and breadth provided by the Memphis  series, the American Lawyer article or Gorney's Washington Post articles. Nor  did the local media, with rare exception, do the stories it traditionally does  on an event like McMartin.  </P> <P> On some big stories, there isn't time for anything more than routine daily  coverage and maybe an occasional analysis or human-interest feature. But  McMartin dragged on for six years, often with little new happening for weeks at  a time, and still the media seldom stepped back to take a comprehensive view or  to write in broad terms about some of the major issues and individuals in the  case.  </P> <P> Children's Institute International originally said 369 children were molested  at McMartin. Only 41 testified before the grand jury, and only nine testified  at the trial. What happened to the other 300-plus children. Were they  traumatized? In therapy? In another preschool? Did any recant?  </P> <P> Stories on these questions were hard to find. Nor were there many profiles of  the principal players in the case -- the judge and the lead attorneys. A search  of media files before the verdicts wouldn't turn up much on the crucial  behind-the-scenes role played by screenwriter Abby Mann and his wife Myra  either.  </P> <P> The Manns first interested "60 Minutes" in the case -- most of the interviews  for the 1986 program were filmed in the Manns' living room -- and they made a  book and movie deal with Glenn Stevens, the former deputy district attorney who  left his job under fire after he told reporters of his doubts about the  prosecution's case.  </P> <P> The tape-recorded interviews in which Stevens told the Manns of his misgivings  about the case and in which he accused his former colleagues of prosecutorial  misconduct became a major controversy during pretrial maneuvering in the case.  As usual, the press covered the controversy. But the Manns were little more  than an afterthought.  </P> <P> Doug Conner of The Times' editorial library assisted with research for this  story.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 2, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> 'GENTLEMAN BANDIT' GIVEN 50-YEAR TERM  </P> <P> Robert Hal Brame, dubbed by authorities the "gentleman bandit" suspected in  about 100 bank robberies across the nation, was sentenced to 50 years in prison  Wednesday by a San Diego federal judge for charges stemming from two October  1988 holdups in San Diego County.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge J. Lawrence Irving called Brame the "quintessential career  criminal" and said he was a "professional thug" who was "addicted to bank  robberies."  </P> <P> Brame, 35, pleaded guilty July 20 to two counts of bank robbery and two counts  of being a convicted felon in possession of a firearm.  </P> <P> Brame admitted robbing the Home Federal Savings &amp; Loan branch in  Tierrasanta of $1,075 on Oct. 5, 1988, and the next day, of robbing the Trust  Savings Bank in Carlsbad of $21,450. He also admitted using a gun both times,  Assistant U.S. Atty. David Katz said.  </P> <P> Both robberies followed the same pattern, Katz said. Dressed in a business suit  and tie, Brame chatted up an officer at each bank about opening a retirement  account, then pulled a gun and demanded money.  </P> <P> Irving sentenced Brame to 25-year consecutive terms in federal prison for each  of the two robberies. The judge also sentenced him to five years for each of  the weapons charges but said those sentences could run concurrently with the  robbery sentences, Katz said.  </P> <P> Brame could have been sentenced to a maximum of 60 years. The 50-year sentence  he received means he will be eligible for parole in 42 1/2 years, Katz said.  </P> <P> "This sentence will definitely go a long way toward protecting the public from  Robert Brame," he said.  </P> <P> FBI agents arrested Brame in Sacramento on Oct. 28, 1988. Authorities had been  searching for him since he escaped in 1986 from a North Carolina prison, Katz  said.  </P> <P> During those two years, authorities believe, Brame used the same routine he  used in the two San Diego-area robberies in about 100 holdups nationwide.  Called the "gentleman bandit" because of his business suits, Brame preferred  Ralph Lauren clothes, Katz said.  </P> <P> Brame still faces prosecution on robbery charges in Northern California,  Arizona, Arkansas, Georgia and Florida, Katz said. He has been convicted of a  number of other offenses, including kidnaping, escape and assaulting a police  officer with a weapon, Katz said.  </P></p>

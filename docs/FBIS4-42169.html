			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Ian Black article: "Britain Expels Iranian Official"] </F>   [Text] Britain has ordered the expulsion of a diplomat  from Iran's embassy in London but is keeping the move quiet in  the hope that Tehran will not retaliate for the latest in a  series of open rows between the two countries.    Iran's charge d'affaires, Gholamreza Ansari, was told of the  decision on Thursday [26 May] when he was summoned to see the  Foreign Office Minister of State, Douglas Hogg.    Foreign Office officials refused to comment yesterday on the  meeting except to insist it was not linked to the fatwa calling  for the killing of Salman Rushdie, the author of The Satanic  Verses -- the main irritant in Anglo-lranian relations.    Iran's embassy also refused to comment.    The expulsion follows recent British charges that Iranian  intelligence has been in clandestine contact with the IRA. This  was denied by Tehran, which then made the charge --  conspicuously not denied -- that Britain's M16 had planted a bug  in the London embassy.    Unusual secrecy surrounded the expulsion decision, and it  was  not clear whether it was related to the IRA row or to other  bilateral strains. Suggestions of a Bosnian link were played  down. Mr Ansari was told there was irrefutable evidence of  wrongdoing.    Britain wants to keep the expulsion quiet to preclude  Iranian  tit-for-tat expulsions. Both countries are limited, by mutual  agreement, to 15 diplomats in each other's capital.    Reticence about the decision stems from concern that  publicity given to the IRA allegations last month was  counterproductive, provoking anti-British hostility in Iran,  including calls for a boycott of British trade or even the  severing of links.    Relations between the two countries have been stormy since  Iran's Islamic revolution in l979. Ties were severed in 1989  over the Rushdie affair but restored in 1990.</p>

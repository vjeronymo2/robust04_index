[passage  omitted] ITAR-TASS has learned that Aleksandr Lysenko arrived  in Washington in July 1993. He is 56 years old. The Russian  Federation Embassy stated that "they had no comment on the State  Department's statement." Immediately after the announcement by  the State Department, a large group of American TV reporters and  media photographers gathered at the Russian Federation Embassy,  practically blocking the entrance to the building situated a few  blocs away from the White House. Policemen who are permanently  stationed at the Embassy are watching the developments with  indifference.</p>

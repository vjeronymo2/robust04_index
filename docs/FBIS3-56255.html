To quote Dzhumagulov, the government has drafted proposals  for reducing agricultural enterprises' profit tax from 35% to  15%. It is also planning to purchase agricultural produce at  market prices.    It will also establish a monopoly on the production and sale  of alcoholic beverages, cigarettes and bread, all of which will  require changes in the current legislation.    Dzhumagulov also noted that in order to increase the budget,  the ministries and departments' personnel would be reduced by  20%. This will save the state 190 Mn soms (1 som equals 160  rubles).</p>

			<p><P> September 10, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHARGERS FAKE OUT THEMSELVES, LOSE, 17-14;  </P> <P> COWBOYS: DALLAS TURNS A BOTCHED FAKE-PUNT PLAY INTO THE GO-AHEAD TOUCHDOWN.  </P> <P> The Dallas Cowboys got a gift on Sunday and converted it into the team's first  home victory under Coach Jimmy Johnson.  </P> <P> Cowboy quarterback Troy Aikman made San Diego Coach Dan Henning pay dearly for  a fake punt gamble as the Cowboys beat the Chargers, 17-14, Sunday before  48,063 at Texas Stadium -- the smallest home crowd in 26 years.  </P> <P> It was the Cowboys' first home victory since Sept. 25, 1988, when they defeated  Atlanta. The victory ended a streak of 14 consecutive home losses.  </P> <P> "I've been looking for that, it's been a long time," Aikman said of the  victory. "I've had a lot of abuse from the press. But all the work we've done  has made it worth it."  </P> <P> Aikman sneaked into the end zone from one yard out with 1:58 left after  directing a 53-yard scoring drive.  </P> <P> The Chargers had tried the fake punt on fourth and six with 5:15 remaining.  Linebacker Gary Plummer was stopped by Bill Bates and Daniel Stubbs after a two  yard-yard gain.  </P> <P> "I knew something was up," said Bates, captain of the special teams. "We  expected them to try something. The tackle didn't try to block me like he does  normally."  </P> <P> Henning was distraught about losing a game which the Chargers seemingly had  wrapped up.  </P> <P> "It was a dumb mistake," Henning said. "I was hoping somebody would bail me out  on it but it wasn't blocked correctly. I should have called it off. It's a  disappointing loss, the kind I'll carry around a long time."  </P> <P> Cowboy running back Emmitt Smith, a first-round pick from Florida who held out  for a club record 48 days, rushed two times for two yards.  </P> <P> Johnson got the game ball, his second. The first came from the Cowboys' only  1989 victory, 13-3 over Washington at RFK Stadium.  </P> <P> "It's a great feeling," Johnson said. "This win will allow us to gain momentum  and win again. If it had gone the other way, it would have meant a lot more  hard work."  </P> <P> It was San Diego's fourth consecutive opening loss. The Chargers are now 18-13  in the first game of the season. Dallas has the NFL record of 23-7-1.  </P></p>

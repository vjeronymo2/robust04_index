			<p><P> March 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OTHER COMMENTARY / EXCERPTS;  </P> <P> SELLING THE HUMAN SPIRIT SHORT  </P> <P> During the decade of the 1980s, the United States spent billions to carry out  the war in Central America. Thirty thousand Nicaraguans lost their lives.  </P> <P> We imposed economic sanctions until the economy was reduced to a shambles. We  mined their harbors in violation of international law, then thumbed our nose at  the World Court when its decision went against us. Finally, we openly financed  the political campaign of Violeta Barrios de Chamorro.  </P> <P> If a country we depended on -- say, Japan -- were to cut us off economically,  finance terrorist attacks against us and fund one party in an election  campaign, we would be outraged at the violation of international law and  treaties. We would hardly call the elections free and fair.  </P> <P> We should strive for democracy everywhere in the world. But we should define  democracy and support it with one set of rules. As we seek to gain the trust of  our children and encourage moral behavior and raise ethical standards, we must  not let our hypocritical version of democracy in Nicaragua stand as the  example.  </P></p>

			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Letter: 'Game' of picking winners has worked well in east Asia Sir, I hope that the leader writer responsible for 'Mr Heseltine's magic lantern' (April 26) will have read Michael Prowse's adjacent article. While the leader writer was concerned to draw attention to the 'unrewarding and outdated game of picking industrial and technological Euro-winners', Mr Prowse's article highlighted the positive aspects of just such action for the successful Asian economies: 'Government played a big role (in their economic success), trade was not open and financial markets were repressed . . . The lesson from east Asia is that you need a government guiding hand: you cannot just abdicate development to the private sector.' And the article concludes, saying: 'The implication is that sufficiently determined governments can work similar miracles in other places.' Just because the UK is an old, established industrialised country, it does not mean that it cannot or should not adopt the practices of successful newcomers. Indeed, the government is very fond of talking about the fact that UK manufacturing industry has benefited from the imported working practices of Japanese companies, for example. Quite right. But why should it, or your leader writer, believe that other elements of Japanese or Asian practice are not also suitable candidates for adoption?

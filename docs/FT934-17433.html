			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / Brazil to review country's basic law BRAZIL is due to begin next Wednesday what could be a profound constitutional revision, which the government and business leaders hope will help to solve some of the country's problems. The revision, due to last at least until year-end, is in accordance with the 1988 constitution, which called for a review after five years. Even so, the revision was in doubt because of opposition by left-wing politicians and church groups, who fear it could undermine workers' rights. Likely to be reviewed are bans on foreign investment in sectors such as mining, and government monopolies in telecommunications and oil. Proposals to amend workers' rights and job security for civil servants are unlikely to be tabled as they are politically too divisive. The Congress voted late on Wednesday to initiate its review, after noisy protests from opposition groups. Under the process, the constitution can be amended by simple majority, compared with 60 per cent majorities in both chambers of Congress now required for any constitutional change. Supporters of the review say it could help resolve economic problems such as the federal government's deficit. They blame the budget deficit on large transfers, required by the constitution, from the federal government to states and municipalities. Reduction of these transfers, or of the federal government's other obligations, would bring down the deficit and help reduce inflation, they argue.</p>

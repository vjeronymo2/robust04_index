			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / Discount food retailers lift sales DISCOUNT food retailers are becoming a significant force in the food market and could double their sales by 1996, according to Verdict, the retail market research company. In a report published today, Verdict says discounters have doubled their annual sales in 10 years, to Pounds 4bn last year. Their numbers are increasing, leading to intensified competition in the sector. Two years ago there were only three discount chains trading in the UK - Kwik Save, Lo-Cost, part of the Argyll group, and Normans, part of the Merchant Retail Group. These have been supplemented by two discount retailers from Germany - Aldi and Netto. Existing supermarket chains have introduced discount formats to revive the fortunes of old or underperforming stores. These include Food Giant and Solo (both operated by Gateway), Pioneer (the Co-op) and Dales (Asda). Isle of Man-based Shoprite has opened 33 discount stores in Scotland and plans 22 more this year. A comparative survey by Verdict found that Netto offered the cheapest prices for a basket of 40 basic items. Its total was 16 per cent lower than the average of the lowest available prices for a similar basket at Sainsbury, Tesco, Asda and Safeway stores, and 10 per cent lower than the average among the 10 discounters surveyed. Next cheapest were Kwik Save, 14 per cent cheaper than the superstores' average, and Aldi, 12 per cent cheaper. Sales of goods at petrol forecourt shops increased by 10 per cent to almost Pounds 1.7bn last year, research group Corporate Intelligence says in a report today. Although cigarettes, confectionery and ice cream remained the leading items, sales of grocery goods were growing. The report predicted sustained growth in forecourt shop sales at well above the rate for other retailing outlets. Verdict on Food Discounters. Verdict Research, 112 High Holborn, London WC1V 6JS.

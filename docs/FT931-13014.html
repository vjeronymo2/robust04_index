			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / World Trade News: Top spirit brands see sales decline VOLUME sales of the top 100 international spirits brands declined for the second successive year in 1992 as markets worldwide were hit by the bleak economic climate. Total shipments fell 1.2 per cent from 273.5m cases to 270.2m, according to Impact International, the drinks industry monitor. Reduced consumer spending was particularly marked in the US, UK and Japan. 'While still a lucrative market, Japan is no longer the easy-growth, high-profit market it was in the late 1980s,' says Impact. Scotch whisky sales in Japan last year were between 5 per cent and 10 per cent below the 1991 level. Cognac volumes were 15 per cent down, and bourbon consumption declined 10 per cent. However, markets elsewhere, in south-east Asia, and in southern European countries such as Spain, Greece and Portugal, remained buoyant with consumers still moving from local spirits brands to imports. 'Latin America is also emerging as the key potential growth area for the 1990s,' the report says. Grand Metropolitan, Guinness, and Allied-Lyons, the UK-based groups which own 31 of the leading 100 brands, saw total volumes down 2.1m cases. Of the top 10 companies, owning 62 brands, only three - Pedro Domecq, Brown-Forman, and American Brands - increased volume sales. The top three brands maintained their rankings in spite of significant volume losses. Difficult trading conditions in the US contributed to a 1.9 per cent decrease in sales of Bacardi rum, the world's best-selling spirit. Volumes dropped from 21.6m to 21.2m cases. GrandMet's Smirnoff vodka, in second place, recorded a 4.1 per cent decline to 14.2m cases. Sales of Ricard, the French anis brand, were 1.3 per cent down at 7.4m cases in third spot. The three leading Scotch whisky brands increased sales. Guinness's Johnnie Walker Red was 1.5 per cent ahead at 6.6m cases. GrandMet's J&amp;B Rare, continuing to gain ground on its rival, grew 3.3 per cent to 6.2m cases. Allied's Ballantine's recorded a 1.9 per cent increase to 5.3m cases. Bourbon sales recovered strongly from a setback in 1991. American Brands' Jim Beam grew 8 per cent to 5.2m cases; Brown-Forman's Jack Daniels achieved a 4.8 per cent increase to 4.4m cases; and the group's Early Times brand was 3.6 per cent up at 1.5m cases. Leading cognacs suffered badly from the worldwide recession. Only Remy Martin gained volume, up 3.9 per cent to 1.7m cases. Hennessy, the category leader, declined 2.6 per cent to 2.5m cases. Other cheaper brandies recorded generally good performances. Among white spirits, Jose Cuervo tequila achieved a 2.9 per cent increase in sales to 4.3m cases. Six brands of gin recorded a combined decline of 1.1 per cent. Guinness's market leader, Gordon's, fell 1.6 per cent to 6.1m cases but Seagram's gin bucked the trend with a 2.3 per cent rise to 4.4m cases.</p>

			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / International Company News: Bayerische Vereinsbank rises 32% Bayerische Vereinsbank yesterday became the second large German bank to report substantial growth in profits for 1993. The Munich-based Vereinsbank said group operating profits after provisions for bad and doubtful debts increased by 32 per cent to DM1.16bn (Dollars 687m). The increase, more details of which will be revealed today, follows a 33 per cent increase in profits from Bayerische Hypotheken und Wechsel Bank, the other big Bavarian bank which reported earlier this week. It means that Vereinsbank's profits growth accelerated in the last two months of 1993 following a 27 per cent rise in the first 10 months of the year. Bayerische Vereinsbank, which has just below a quarter of the domestic mortgage market, said the dividend would increase by DM3 to DM16. Half the increase is designed to pass on to shareholders the benefits of reduced corporate taxation; the other half is a special dividend to celebrate the bank's 125th anniversary reached in May this year. Hypo-Bank earlier this week reported that provisioning for bad and doubtful debts climbed by 31.1 per cent to DM1.16bn and warned that the bad debt situation is unlikely to improve until 1995. The rise in provisions was offset by an increase in profits from own account trading as well as from lending business and fee income, a pattern likely to be repeated today. Both the big Bavarian banks have a high exposure to mortgage lending business, which was buoyant last year amid excellent conditions in most sectors of the German banking market.</p>

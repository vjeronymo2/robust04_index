			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: LME secondary aluminium trading backed ODDS IN favour of the London Metal Exchange's proposed secondary (scrap) aluminium contract have improved considerably after a special LME committee, set up 16 months ago to consider the idea, recommended that the new contract be introduced. But the LME directors are procrastinating about the controversial project and have neither rejected nor supported this recommendation. Instead, members of the exchange have been given one more month to comment on detailed proposals that have been circulated. The type of secondary aluminium the LME has in mind for its contract is mainly used in components for the motor industry. This use accounts for 70 to 80 per cent of the market, which totals about 4m tonnes a year. The LME has told members it would not authorise any warehouse to hold the secondary metal unless the warehouse temperature and humidity were controlled. This is because secondary aluminium ingot oxidises and deteriorates over time. At present none of the LME authorised warehouses around the world provides such controls. However, the exchange says many of them do have temperature-controlled sheds. Mr Martin Abbott, the LME's director of marketing, said yesterday that it was likely that the members' comments would be considered at the exchange's March board meeting. He said it would take at least six months from the go-ahead being given for trading to start.</p>

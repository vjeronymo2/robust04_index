			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / International Company News: Norsk Hydro to sell Dutch unit NORSK HYDRO, Norway's biggest listed company, is to seek offers for Norsk Hydro Noordzee, the subsidiary which holds all of the company's Dutch oil and gas exploration and production interests, writes Karen Fossli. Hydro's move follows a lead taken earlier this year by Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company, to pull out of the Dutch North Sea sector. Norsk Hydro said that the sale in no way affects other activities in the Netherlands.</p>

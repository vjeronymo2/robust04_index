The fighting broke out a day after country's leaders signed  a  deal patching up their differences.    A tank was also destroyed when brigades from the north and  south fought for an hour in the Abyan region, 100 kilometres (60  miles) east Aden, a source close to Defense Minister Haytham  Qasim Tahir said.    Each side accused the other of sparking the clash after  moving troops toward the old border between the former North  Yemen and poorer South Yemen, which merged in 1990.    On Sunday, Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and his  southern rival Vice-President 'Ali Salim al-Bid met in the  Jordanian capital Amman to sign a deal calling for major  economic, political and military reforms.    The accord, aimed at ending a dispute which threatened to  split the country, called for withdrawing troops facing each  other along the old border and banned troop movements in cities  and on main roads.    Monday's fighting ended after the intervention of a military  commission that had been set up to implement withdrawals,  officials said.    Salim Salih Muhammad, a top YSP [Yemeni Socialist Party]  official and member of the Presidential Council, also told AFP  that Salih, al-Bid and Jordan's King Husayn had contacted  officials in Abyan to restore calm.    King Husayn said Sunday that the accord was "a positive  start  for Arabs to settle their own differences."    Muhammad accused northern troops of having deployed further  south, closer to Aden. But a northern official who asked not to  be named alleged that southern troops had moved forward.  [passage omitted]    Al-Bid underlined his commitment to the accord despite  "reservations and wounds." He said he could visualize the faces  of relatives killed in political violence, but "Yemen is dearer  to us.    "We are going to turn over a new leaf...and we will start  applying this document," Al-Bid added. Salih thanked the  United States and European Union for helping in the  reconciliation.</p>

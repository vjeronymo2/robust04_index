			<p><P> June 30, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: REAL ESTATE;  </P> <P> MONARCH BEACH LUXURY RESORT PLANS DELAYED AGAIN, AT LEAST UNTIL FALL  </P> <P> The developers of a plush oceanside resort in Dana Point say construction has  been delayed again, this time at least until fall.  </P> <P> The California Coastal Commission approved the $300-million Monarch Beach  Resort more than a year ago. As late as March, Dana Point developer Stein-Brief  Group Inc. said construction would begin in May.  </P> <P> Now it could be the end of the year before construction starts, Stein-Brief  said this week.  </P> <P> The developer said the delay was caused by "minor processing things" but  declined to elaborate.  </P> <P> Instead, the developer referred questions to Hemmeter Development Co., the  Hawaiian resort developer that is an equal partner with Stein-Brief in the  project.  </P> <P> Stein-Brief's public relations firm traced the delay to "lengthy negotiations"  with community groups over obligations to build playing fields in Dana Point.  </P> <P> The two companies plan to build 1,126 hotel rooms in a main hotel and a smaller  wing, part of an explosion of county seaside resorts.  </P> <P> Another project, Waterfront in Huntington Beach, is under development. And the  Irvine Co. said this week it had selected Marriott Corp. to run an 1,100-room  resort it plans on land it owns between Laguna Beach and Newport Beach.  </P></p>

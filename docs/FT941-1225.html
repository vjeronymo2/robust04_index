			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Ingenuity - The FT Engineering Review (19): Supply chain links grow tighter - A leading UK equipment builder exemplifies the changing relations between engineering customers and suppliers / Construction Equipment III: JC Bamford (JCB) One of the best ways to examine the changing nature of the relationship between customer and supplier in the engineering industry - producing benefits for both sides - is to look at developments in the construction equipment sector. JC Bamford (JCB), Britain's biggest construction equipment producer, is a case in point. Its supplier base has been thinned from 750 in the mid-1980s to about 250, sorted by quality, and brought into continuous cost reduction programmes much as has occurred at most leading producers of excavators and other earthmoving equipment. Within the past three or four years, JCB has moved to classifying its suppliers depending on their strategic importance to the company, with the most crucial being drawn into the company's new product development programme at a much earlier stage. In return for a reasonable guarantee of long-term business, so long as they can satisfy JCB on cost and quality, the more important suppliers are expected to make suggestions on how their own products can be better used and are trusted to do a lot of the detailed design work themselves so long as they keep to performance parameters. The idea is to use suppliers' expertise rather than having to do everything in-house, says Mr John Appleby, former JCB purchasing director for its main machines and now, following a reorganisation last year, managing director of its wheeled loader division. For example, two suppliers, Airflow Streamline of Northampton and German-based Rexroth, were deeply involved in designing respectively the cab and hydraulics system for JCB's new wheeled loader after being shown the prototype. Alternatively, JCB has used a deeper relationship with a supplier to solve a problem, such as it had with electrical wiring harnesses. Larger suppliers geared to automotive industry volumes were not interested in supplying JCB, and small suppliers were underskilled and undercapitalised, says Mr Appleby. JCB identified one supplier, Wexford Electronics, with potential for improvement and worked together with the Waterford-based company to develop all the attributes necessary to become the preferred supplier, with a dedicated team producing parts just for JCB. A further approach is to give the supplier responsibility for delivery direct to the production line. This is increasingly happening in the crucial, yet perhaps somewhat humdrum area of industrial fasteners - nuts, bolts and rivets etc. Here, JCB has set up a direct line feed from MBS Distribution, the Birmingham-based fastener distribution company which now supplies fasteners on a daily basis to the production line, controls quality and stores goods to JCB's specification. The arrangement means that JCB does not have to worry about its fasteners, but it also has benefits for MBS, says Mr Floyd Thorpe, its managing director. Three years ago, before it started such arrangements, it had 23,000 different customers, and had to carry huge stocks because it was living on a day-to-day basis. Crucially, it was not making money. It decided to change course, and now 90 per cent of its business is on a customised basis for 60-65 customers including JCB and other big names such as Black &amp; Decker and Otis. It receives advanced notice of changes in production levels so can prepare accordingly, carries fewer lines of stock because it is more focused, and can strongly influence the use of fasteners in new products. 'We have three people permanently on-site at JCB and the whole of MBS has been turned into mini-businesses closely focused on customers,' he says. There are costs, however, in such relationships, which mean the supplier is holding stock for the customer and is also having to deliver fewer parts less often. Last year, MBS commissioned an activity-based costings analysis from World Class International, the Hampshire-based industrial consultants, to enable it to cost with confidence any future just-in-time arrangements which it takes on. Mr Thorpe is convinced that the new strategy is the main reason for MBS' recent turnround into profit and sharp rise in annual sales from about Pounds 8m in the late 1980s to Pounds 15m-Pounds 16m at present. The downside of such relationships, of course, is when the customer hits trouble or goes bust. Leyland Daf was a big customer before it went into receivership, and MBS would have lost 5 per cent of its sales if nothing had survived of the van and truck producer. Happily, it has continued supplying to the Leyland Daf van plant in Birmingham following last year's buyout. Customers, though, can also have such problems, especially during a recession. Mr Appleby recalls a situation where JCB heard on a Friday that a strategic supplier of fabrications was to call in the receivers on the following Monday. Over the weekend, JCB had 22 truckloads of work-in-progress and tools shifted to other suppliers, with executives including Mr Appleby operating fork-lifts to complete the task. 'We don't want any more like that,' he says.</p>

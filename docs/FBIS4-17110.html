			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Vladimir Kuznechevskiy article: "Bone of Contention. Who </F> Is Keen To See Russian-Ukrainian Relations Balkanized"]    [Text] Following the meeting of CIS heads of state 15  April, the presidents of Russia and Ukraine were able yet again  and for the umpteenth time to reach agreement on settling the  conflict over the Black Sea Fleet. Leonid Kravchuk informed  journalists that it had been decided to divide the fleet up in  the ratio 15:85 in Russia's favor. However, on 16 April it  became clear that this agreement would be very hard to implement.    As Ukrainian Defense Minister General Radetskyy explained to  the mass media in Moscow, the correct formula was not the one  approved by the countries' two presidents but a quite different  one indeed: The fleet is to be divided in the ratio 50:50. Of  the 50 percent allocated to Russia, 15 percent is to remain  Ukrainian property which Ukraine is subsequently prepared to  sell to Russia. The defense minister also explained Leonid  Kravchuk's remark about Russia's henceforth getting the chance  to use Sevastopol as a naval base, but on a lease basis. During  his talks with Pavel Grachev, Radetskyy proposed basing the  Russian part of the Black Sea Fleet at two other naval bases in  Crimea rather than Sevastopol.    Such a radical rereading of this heated issue raises doubt  about whether the fleet will finally be divided up in the next  10 days as Leonid Kravchuk has promised and whether the problem  will then cease to be a bone of contention between Russia and  Ukraine.    Some people and some forces in Ukraine are evidently very  keen not only to see the Black Sea Fleet issue remain on the  agenda of relations between our two countries, but also to see  these relations permanently deteriorate if need be. In fact, on  at least four occasions already (at Yalta, Mukhalatka,  Massandra, and Zavidovo) the two countries' presidents have  reached a final agreement on resolving the problem of the Black  Sea Fleet. And every single time people and forces in the  Ukrainian Supreme Council, Ministry of Defense, and state and  political structures have started to whip up the problem of  Ukraine's national independence, and using this obfuscation they  conceal the agreements that have been reached or reject them out  of hand, not even balking at the prospect of placing general  relations between our two countries on the brink of military  conflict.    All the indications are that for some time now these forces  have ascribed no importance whatsoever to their president's  signature on agreements which would lead to an improvement in  relations between the two largest Slav states. And these  forces, apparently, have nothing except their desire for power.  But in order to keep themselves afloat, they are extolling the  notorious bugbear of nationalism. And this argument still  works. There are people who are still prepared to believe that  all Ukraine's misfortunes can be blamed on their northern  neighbor. And people whose own interests are extremely far  removed from Ukraine's genuine interests are shamelessly  striving to reap political dividends on the basis of this  enduring faith.    Unfortunately, there is still a possibility that  Russian-Ukrainian relations will become Balkanized. Therefore  we can only see one way of ensuring that relations between our  two fraternal states do not turn into extreme forms of  confrontation, namely restraint and a calm reaction to the  outbursts of the nationalists, who have donned the garb of  defenders of genuine Ukrainian national interests. On a  historical scale, time is on the side of the restoration of  close economic, cultural, and political ties between our peoples.</p>

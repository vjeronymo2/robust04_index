			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / The real obstacles to free trade: America When critics say the Clinton administration's trade policy is confused, what they mean is that they disagree with it. As in the early days of any new administration, policymakers clash on occasion. Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the treasury secretary, may sound more committed to classical free trade principles than, say, Mr Mickey Kantor, the trade representative, or Ms Laura Tyson, the White House chief economist. But these are nuances: there is a great deal of agreement on fundamental principles. Nobody in the Clinton team - from the president down - believes much can be gained from new protectionist barriers to imports. They want more rather than less trade. On the other hand, they think the US's relative economic decline in recent decades partly reflects an asymmetrical trading structure. American markets, especially for high-tech goods, have been more open and less subsidised than those of most other industrialised countries, putting US companies at a disadvantage. This can be put right, the US believes, only by policies that emphasise 'equal access' to markets. Purely reciprocal trade concessions are not enough because, given the starting point, they would still leave US markets more exposed than those of trading partners such as Japan. These arguments have force. No country any longer advocates the kind of unilateral free trade embraced by Victorian Britain. In the immediate postwar decades the US was willing to have more open markets than its trading partners for two reasons: it was an economic superpower and trade concessions were a useful way of winning support for its 'containment of communism' strategy. Now that communism is dead and the US's economic strength is much reduced, it is understandably seeking a genuinely level playing field in trade. If there is a ground for complaint, it concerns tactics. Taking its lead from Republican administrations, the Clinton team is preparing unilaterally to impose sanctions on Japan and other countries it deems unfair traders. It appears determined to use the 1986 semiconductor accord, which set a quantitative target for foreign penetration of the Japanese market, as a model for other sectoral agreements. So far this kind of 'managed trade' seems to be attracting surprisingly little opposition. At a recent Washington lunch, Mr Jean Claude Paye, secretary-general of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, pointedly refused to condemn quantitative targets. 'If the US policy leads to a non-discriminatory opening of closed markets, it will be good,' he said. In other words, US bully-boy tactics are fine so long as a piece of Japanese action is reserved for Europe. This is too complacent a view. Why should bureaucratic measures that reserve a chunk of Japanese markets for foreign (mainly US) companies encourage the Japanese to adopt more market-oriented policies? The history of interference in market mechanisms in trade suggests that such an intervention will be neither temporary nor regionally contained. Such 'voluntary import expansion' orders would probably spread like wildfire, just as voluntary export restrictions did in the 1980s. If this is what the Clinton people really want, they are short-sighted. On the other hand, economists enraged by such policies should recognise that the US plans, in part, are a legitimate reaction to the shortcomings of the multilateral rules underwritten by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The structural and cultural impediments that hamper foreign access to Japanese markets are frequently not covered by the Gatt rules. But, rather than wrecking relations with Tokyo by insisting on what amounts to disguised import quotas for US companies, the US should be thinking more strategically about trade policy. The bilateral deficit with Japan is much less important than overall US trade deficit which can only be reduced by macroeconomic means. The tensions with Japan reflect a general problem: the fact that the ability of companies to compete globally is affected by a whole range of domestic policies, not just the level of protection at the border. As production becomes increasingly globalised, the challenge is not just to create a level playing field in trade but a level playing field generally. This means ensuring that the overall level of government support for industries is roughly equalised. The US thus ought to be pushing hard for agreement on the terms of reference for a post-Uruguay Round of trade talks to address the domestic obstacles to truly cosmopolitan capitalism, such as differences in national industrial, technology and competition policies. Unilateral threats sound tough but they can never properly address the worldwide interests of US companies. Companies that operate globally need globally-valid trade rules. The only forum in which the US can hope to forge a global trade regime good for both the US and its partners is the Gatt. Mr Clinton says he supports the Gatt process. But like so many American policymakers, he appears unable to grasp the overriding importance of multilateral rules and institutions as economies grow ever more interdependent. It is a curious shortcoming given his sensitivity to such institutions in military and diplomatic policy.</p>

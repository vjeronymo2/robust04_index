			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / International Company News: PWA seeks CDollars 200m in airline deal PWA, the parent of Canadian Airlines International, is seeking CDollars 200m (USDollars 169.5m) cash in return for selling 25 per cent of the airline to American Airlines. Mr Rhys Eyton, chairman of PWA and the airline, said in Toronto that effective control of Canadian Airlines would remain in Canada, in spite of pooling of computer resources and ground personnel. He was confident AMR, parent of American, was ready 'to consider an equity infusion of more than CDollars 200m to Canadian Airlines in exchange for the 25 per cent interest and the right to provide management services'. Analysts had estimated Mr Eyton would seek about CDollars 100m in new equity for Canadian. Both companies are now in negotiations. Mr Eyton said PWA's common shareholders would be favourably affected because it would be Canadian Airlines issuing new Treasury shares to American in return for the cash infusion and 'a comprehensive strategic alliance'. 'We cannot be absolutely sure the deal with American will be finalised, and that is why we're negotiating with our lenders to double our operating credit lines to CDollars 400m,' said Mr Eyton. He estimated that between 1,500 and 2,000 ground workers would lose their jobs, but there would be no impact on pilots, flight attendants, counter staff, and the maintenance base in Vancouver.</p>

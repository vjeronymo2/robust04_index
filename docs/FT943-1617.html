			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Fiat chief calls for reforms Mr Giovanni Agnelli, chairman of Fiat, Italy's biggest private-sector industrial group, called in London yesterday for the reform of the Italian public sector and welfare state. Italy's public-sector debt was an obstacle to investment and economic recovery, Mr Agnelli said at a ceremony to announce the UK's 1994 Venturer of the Year award. Italy's public-sector deficit has risen to more than 10 per cent of GDP and the stock of debt is more than 120 per cent of GDP, considerably higher than in the rest of Europe. Mr Agnelli said Italy's economy was moving in the right direction, with inflation falling, the balance of trade positive and competitiveness improving but the situation in the Italian public sector and welfare state was 'particularly grave'. The Venturer of the Year award, sponsored by Cartier, the jewellers, The Financial Times and the British Venture Capital Association, was won by Mr Stephen Noar, a 47-year old dentist who eight years ago formed Denplan, a company which provides private dental healthcare programmes. He sold the company last year for Pounds 42m to Private Patients Plan, the medical insurer. Venture and Development Capital, separate section</p>

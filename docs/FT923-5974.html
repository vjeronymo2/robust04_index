			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: WH Smith WH Smith's full-year profits show the benefit of last year's rights issue and a handily reduced tax charge. That said, the good news is not restricted to the financial side of the business. The defensive strengths of the core retailing and distribution operations shine through, and it is heartening to hear that better management information systems are being extended into Our Price records and Waterstone's booksellers. The hope must be that this will allow staff productivity and stock control to continue to improve across the group. Even the Monopolies and Mergers Commission investigation into newspaper distribution seems unlikely to undermine Smith's profits. However, there are bad points, and a picture of WH Smith as a well-run core business which squanders money on diversifications is not entirely unfair. The latest problem child is the Do It All joint venture with Boots. This suffers from a weak market position relative to rivals Texas and B&amp;Q, and the 'shed' price wars which have been such a feature this year. Some rationalisation is now under way, but it is difficult to see Do It All differentiating itself sufficiently from the competition to overcome its inherent weakness. Fortunately, though it may continue to be a drain on earnings, it is difficult to see the DIY arm becoming a threat to the group. Even after yesterday's rise, the shares look reasonable value against the sector.</p>

			<p><P> May 4, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'HIRE' A SUBTLE, SPLENDID STORY OF SEDUCTION  </P> <P> With his round black hat, pale face and black coat, Monsieur Hire, from the  splendid movie of the same name, might have stepped straight out of a painting  by Magritte; you half expect to be able to see blue sky and clouds straight  through him.  </P> <P> Instead, this small, mysterious bachelor is at the heart of a luminous and  hypnotic new film (at the Music Hall) made from one of the novels by the  always-reliable Georges Simenon. Michel Blanc plays Hire and Sandrine Bonnaire  plays his prey, the sensual young woman he watches every night from his window  opposite hers in their old Paris apartment building.  </P> <P> Bonnaire and Blanc are an extraordinary pairing: the warm, carelessly seductive  Alice and the reclusive, almost universally disliked Monsieur Hire, who spends  most of his nights in the dark, listening to Brahms and staring at the yellow  rectangle of light that is her apartment. What makes it creepy is that after  the startling night when Alice catches Monsieur Hire at his compulsion, she  doesn't report him to the police. Instead, she uses her power over him to draw  him into her life until they are both held by a delicately manipulated bond of  eroticism.  </P> <P> It's frightening for us, since we know that the milky-skinned, deeply emotional  Hire is a suspect in the murder of the 22-year-old girl from the apartment next  to his. An almost fatherly inspector (the craggy-faced Andre Wilms) is on the  case, dropping in at odd moments to hound Hire, while at the same time director  Patrice Leconte drops visual hints -- a white mark on Hire's black suit -- that  recall "M" and Peter Lorre's psychopathic killer.  </P> <P> The film's last major character is the thuggish Emile (Luc Thuillier), plainly  less in love with Alice than she is with him. And that is enough about the  story, which is a skein of subtleties played with the utmost deliberation and  intelligence. (The film is rated PG-13, since its eroticism is almost entirely  suggested, not shown.)  </P> <P> The actors are fascinating. Blanc's work has so many different levels and  layers as he builds first sympathy for Hire, then fear about his motives, that  it needs to be seen more than once to appreciate the depth involved.  </P> <P> Alice is one of Bonnaire's rare sunny characters, a country girl from Provence  with predictably lousy judgment about big-city men, but one who's comfortable  with her sexuality and blessedly unneurotic. Bonnaire has now shed every ounce  of the puppy fat she had in "A Nos Amours" and in "Vagabond"; with the contours  of her face defined this way, she's become even more interesting to watch and  she's always been a compelling actress.  </P> <P> "Monsieur Hire" is marvelously all-of-a-piece. Denis Lenoir's lighting camera  work sets a mood that's cool and detached; as a result, in retrospect this  seems to be a film played out in bluish moonlight. The atmosphere is further  deepened by the faintly ominous musical score of British avant-gardist Michael  Nyman, known also for his music for the films of Peter Greenaway.  </P> <P> Director Leconte, who was also co-adapter with Patrick Dewolf, has deliberately  made the period and even the location undefinable, an interesting idea that  connects his film subliminally to French policiers of the '30s and '40s, to the  Polanski of "The Tenant" or to early Hitchcock. Leconte also seems to like  visual puns, like the one in which Hire, eating a soft-boiled egg, is shot from  above and behind, the top of the egg and the top of his perfectly rounded  balding head making an exact match.  </P></p>

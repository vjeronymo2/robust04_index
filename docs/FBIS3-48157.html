			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Suva, Jan 20 (AFP) -- Fijian President Ratu Sir  Kamisese Mara has officially dismissed parliament and announced  national elections to be held from February 18 to 25.    "The president has advised the prime minister, the  honourable  Major General (Sitiveni) Rabuka, of his decision," a government  statement said Wednesday.    Rabuka called for the dissolution of parliament when his  budget was defeated November 29 by seven dissident members of  government who voted against it in the House of Representatives.    Dominance of the ruling Fijian Political Party has been  challenged by a breakaway party, the Fijian Association, which  is led by former deputy prime minister Josevata Kamikamica.    Fiji's 1990 constitution gives indigenous Fijians the right  to hold the premiership and a guaranteed 37 seats in the 70-seat  lower house.    Indian Fijians have 27 seats, other races have five and the  Polynesian island of Rotuma has one.    Polling is spread over a week to allow for voting in  outlying  Fijian islands.</p>

			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (News and Analysis): Dismay at benefit cuts for those on income support - Mortgages and income support Some of the largest mortgage lenders expressed dismay at the cuts in mortgage benefits for people on income support in terms of both new and existing borrowers. The bigger blow will hit new borrowers. People taking out new mortgages from next October will not receive help with their payments for the first nine months if they lose their jobs and have to start claiming income support. There will also be some scaling back of the help available for existing borrowers, which will be detailed today by Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary. Alongside the prospect of a ceiling of Pounds 100,000 on eligible loans, is the likelihood that the 16-week period during which only half the interest payment is met, could be extended. Mr Lilley will also detail the further cuts in housing benefit, signalled yesterday, that in many circumstances local authorities will not be fully reimbursed for the benefits paid where the rent they are paying for claimants is above the the average for the area. The government argues that the existing system, in which central government pays councils in full for the benefit they administer, gives no incentive to local authorities or private landlords to ensure that the rent is reasonable. Although lenders were cautious about the impact of housing benefit before seeing today's further details, they were clear that the changes to income support would put up the cost of mortgages, perhaps particularly for some of the UK's most vulnerable potential homeowners. At the margin, some people might be put off home ownership altogether. Many expressed some scepticism whether payment protection insurance would be available at affordable premiums as widely as the government seemed to assume, and said the move would have a further depressing effect on the housing market, where the recovery was already fragile. Mr David Gilchrist, corporate development manager at Halifax Building Society, the UK's largest mortgage lender, said the society saw it as a surprising move since 'we thought the government was a strong supporter of home ownership'. In the long run, by deterring some people from becoming home owners, it would lead to increased demand for subsidised social housing, he said. There was also the suggestion that it might lead to a 'mini-boom' next year followed by a slight slump, as borrowers sought to take out loans before the benefit became more restricted. Others thought the move less significant. Mr Charles Toner, managing director of retail operations at Abbey National, the UK's second largest mortgage lender, said: 'About 40-50 per cent of our new borrowers have this insurance anyway.' Mr Donald Kirkham, chief executive of Woolwich Building Society, the UK's third largest, said he did not think it would have a particular impact on the market, since only those who would be able to take out this type of insurance were buying homes at present.</p>

"We can welcome this agreement only if it is not aimed  against Serbs. Only if it leads us to peace and not war," he  said following a meeting here with Vladimir Shumeyko, the  chairman of the upper house of Russia's parliament, the  Federation Council.    He said the United States was trying to take over the role  of  the United Nations in the peace process by brokering the  agreement Tuesday under which Bosnia's Moslems and Croats would  form a federation on territory they control in  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    He charged that Washington was "biased in favor of the  Moslems" and voiced concern that the United States was  "monopolising" the process. "We would like to see America  unbiased, impartial and then we would accept one power to  mediate those talks. But I don't think that the United Nations  should be abandoned and let one power arbitrate," he said.    Karadzic, who agreed to Russian requests Tuesday to open  Tuzla airport in northern Bosnia to humanitarian flights as long  as this was under Russian supervision, also said he told  Shumeyko, whose chamber is empowered to authorise the deployment  of Russian troops abroad, that he was ready to pull back on  territorial gains made in the 23-month war.    "We are ready to give back, to roll back, a big amount of  territory. (...) We are ready for compromises and we want  Russia to support us in compromises provided we protect basic  Serbian national interests," he stated.    Karadzic called for "Bosnia's new borders" to be "guaranteed  by an international agreement at the highest level" and cited a  proposal by President Boris Yeltsin to hold a five-nation summit  as an initiative that could lead to such a treaty.</p>

L. 102&hyph;378, October 2, 1992). These provisions include (1) an expanded definition of ``law enforcement officer'' in section 5541 of title 5, United States Code (with conforming amendments in 5 U.S.C. 4521, 5542, and 5547, and section 402 of FEPCA); (2) an amendment to section 404 of FEPCA to provide OPM with the authority to determine the extent to which a special pay adjustment for law enforcement officers may be paid to an employee receiving a special salary rate under 5 U.S.C. 5305 or similar provision of law; and (3) an amendment to section 405 of FEPCA to extend application of the special maximum limitation on relocation bonuses for law enforcement officers to the categories of law enforcement employees listed in section 405 of FEPCA_i.e., Park Police officers, Secret Service Uniformed Division officers, special agents in the Diplomatic Security Service, and probation and pretrial services officers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The 60-day public comment period ended on March 9, 1993. Comments were received from one Federal agency, one employee organization, and one individual. These comments are summarized below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Expanded Definition of ``Law Enforcement Officer'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An agency commented that the provisions in the technical amendments to FEPCA providing special pay adjustments for supervisory and administrative law enforcement employees who are not eligible for special law enforcement retirement coverage are confusing and that the criteria should be applied consistently across the board. These provisions are in law, and OPM does not have the authority to change them. The law provides four definitions of ``law enforcement officer'' for purposes of special pay adjustments that differ according to an employee's retirement coverage and whether his or her position is or is not supervisory or administrative. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An employee who meets the definition of ``law enforcement officer'' in section 5541(3) of title 5, United States Code, must also be subject to the provisions of chapter 51 of title 5, United States Code (Classification), in order to be entitled to a special pay adjustment provided by section 404 of FEPCA. To meet the definition, an employee must be a ``law enforcement officer'' who_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Is subject to the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) or the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS), is in a primary (nonsupervisory) or secondary (supervisory or administrative) law enforcement position, and is actually covered by the corresponding special law enforcement retirement provisions of CSRS or FERS; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Is subject to (CSRS), is in a secondary (supervisory or administrative) position that has been approved for law enforcement retirement purposes, but is not eligible for law enforcement retirement coverage; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Is subject to FERS and, as in (2), is in an approved secondary position, but is not eligible for law enforcement retirement coverage; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

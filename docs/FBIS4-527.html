			<p>BFN     [Text] The Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] says it is  determined to march on Kigali to save Rwandans, who according to  it, are victims of the Army. This course of action has been  condemned by the Republican Democratic Movement [MDR], the main  opposition party. Its West Africa representative, Leon  Kaberuka, spoke to Raphael Mbadinga.    [Begin Kaberuka recording] The origin of the present  crisis....[pauses] It is true that the country is facing  problems, considering the fact that changing over from a  one-party system of government to a multiparty democracy is a  sufficiently arduous task. It was at the delicate stage of the  changeover that the RPF unleashed war from Ugandan territory in  the belief that it is better to resort to the use of arms than  to engage in political dialogue. The origin of the crisis is  that the RPF believed that the solution to the country's  problems -- that is the refugee, economic, and political  problems -- could be solved by the use of force. Things cannot  work out that way. No other party has so far adopted that  philosophy, otherwise the other parties would also have taken up  arms against Habyarimana. That is very easy to do, and should  that have happened, the country would have immediately been  turned into Somalia, Liberia, or Angola which is what the  Rwandan people do not want.

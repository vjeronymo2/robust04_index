			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading TURNOVER in the derivatives markets remained at relatively low levels but picked up substantially during the afternoon when business expanded rapidly, writes Steve Thompson. The late surge came after Abbey National cut its mortgage loan rates in a move interpreted by the market as the forerunner of another cut in UK interest rates. In stock index futures, the December contract opened at 2,612 and drifted back to the 2,588 level in very quiet trading, before stabilising and edging back up to the 2,600 mark over the lunchtime period. The afternoon however saw the market transformed by the Abbey news, Footsie bid speculation and a sharp opening rise on Wall Street, sending the market sharply better and producing a flurry of buying. This moved the contract from the 2,600 level to 2,640 in a ten minute period and it ended a volatile session at 2,641, 21 points above its fair value premium to cash, estimated at 32 points. Turnover, although up on Monday's 5,896 contracts, totalled a disappointing 7,795 contracts. In traded options, total volume reached 25,991 contracts, with the FT-SE 100 option trading 9,170 lots. Dealers noted the continuing heavy activity in Asda stock options which topped the actives list for the second consecutive session with 3,318 contracts traded. Tesco options were also active, with 1,479 contracts traded.</p>

			<p><P> August 20, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ART;  </P> <P> CAN LAGUNA BEACH COMMISSION A WORTHY SCULPTURE FOR $27,000?;  </P> <P> PUBLIC ARTWORK: THE CITY'S 1%-FOR-THE-ARTS PROJECT HAS GOOD INTENTIONS, BUT IN  THE REAL WORLD SUCH A PALTRY SUM WILL, AT BEST, BUY A MINOR PIECE BY AN  UNKNOWN. SO HOW MUCH DOES IT COST TO GET YOURSELF A DECENT WORK?  </P> <P> The city of Laguna Beach is holding a national competition for a sculpture to  be sited at the intersection of Forest Avenue and 3rd Street -- next to City  Hall, which is being remodeled. That sounds like good news -- so long as the  powers that be don't succumb to a winsome dolphin or a designer cube. But the  city is expecting to pay only $27,200 for the artist's fee, fabrication and  installation. That's depressing.  </P> <P> There's no mystery about where the figure came from. It represents 1% of the  remodeling cost, which -- according to Municipal Code, Chapter 1.09 -- is  required to be reserved for a work of art. The mystery is what the city's Arts  Commission expects to get for such a paltry sum.  </P> <P> All the submissions, due on Sept. 14, are to be reviewed by a preliminary  selection committee of (to quote the prospectus) "leading participants in all  levels of the art community." This jury is to choose five semifinalists, the  Arts Commission is to winnow the projects down to two, and the City Council is  to make the final decision.  </P> <P> The 10-member selection committee, which hasn't been completely assembled yet,  includes Charles Desmarais, director of the Laguna Art Museum; Maudette Ball,  administrator of the Foothill Ranch Urban Arts Program in Saddleback Valley;  Melinda Wortz, director of the UC Irvine Fine Arts Gallery; City Councilman  Neil G. Fitzpatrick; Laguna Beach art collector Arnie Kline; and Joe Souvella,  an instructor in the community education program of the Art Institute of  Southern California in Laguna Beach.  </P> <P> When I was invited to be on the committee, I agreed. Foolishly, I didn't  inquire about the budget. When I found out what it was, I was flabbergasted. I  called Philip Hofmann, the staff liaison to the Arts Commission, to ask where  the rest of the money would be coming from. He said the city had no plans to  raise more money, unless, perhaps, "on a contingency basis." That didn't sound  encouraging, and I decided to back out.  </P> <P> So how much does it cost to get yourself a decent public sculpture? Well, of  course, that depends on such factors as the scope of the project, the materials  with which the piece is constructed and whether the artist is young and  inexperienced, in "mid-career" or an established figure. But I was surprised to  see a figure so far under $100,000.  </P> <P> This particular sculpture is supposed to occupy a 188-square-foot site,  incorporate a water element and be no taller than 20 feet. Media "may include  but (are) not limited to metal, stone, ceramic, concrete, fiberglass and mixed  media," according to the prospectus; any material must withstand exposure to  sun and salt air as well as "the possibility of defacement, flood or automobile  accidents."  </P> <P> Although the city's public art program was begun in 1987, this is the first  time a municipal building is involved and the first open competition for a work  of art. A work of art sitting right downtown in front of City Hall will, ipso  facto, help define the city's image, so it behooves the city to plan  accordingly.  </P> <P> Does Laguna Beach want to continue to be seen as the home of earnestly  behind-the-times artsy-craftsy productivity and vapid designer chic? If so, a  three-dimensional doodad by any fledgling artist panting to get a commission  will do just fine. But if the city is willing to entertain the idea of a major  work -- which may very well incorporate a lighthearted point of view but in a  sophisticated, innovative way -- then it needs major league bucks and a major  league vision.  </P> <P> In general, national competitions are difficult to pull off without a sizable  kitty for attention-grabbing mailings and extensive advertising. (Hofmann's  entire public relations budget is only $4,000, so he has settled for putting an  ad in one issue of Artweek magazine and sending press releases to newspapers  across the country.) It's often difficult for artists living at a distance to  visit the site and get a feel for the locale, which can't be communicated in a  dry diagram of specifications.  </P> <P> Even if an artist with a striking idea chose to take no fee at all for coming  up with the concept, heavy-duty materials and the manpower involved in  installation are big-ticket items. To get some perspective on the cost factor,  I spoke with several administrators who work with public art and got a range of  responses.  </P> <P> I mentioned to Mary Beebe the dollar figure of the Laguna Beach project and the  requirement that it incorporate water. Beebe is director of the prestigious  Stuart Collection, a public art program that has placed work by such prominent  artists as Bruce Nauman, Robert Irwin and Terry Allen on the UC San Diego  campus.  </P> <P> "You can't build much more than a drinking fountain for ($27,000)," Beebe said.  "If it's supposed to command the whole plaza, it's ridiculous. . . . An artist  could lose his shirt on a good idea. Maybe it could be done, but it seems  unlikely."  </P> <P> Claudia Chaplin, program manager for the Art in Public Buildings program of the  California Arts Council, said her agency's entire annual project budget is only  $150,000, so grants for outdoor work tend to be in the $25,000 to $30,000  range.  </P> <P> "For $27,000 you could have an emerging artist," she said. "I know a lot of  talented (emerging) artists who could accept a commission like that. . . . If  you're talking bronze, you don't have enough money. If you're talking stone,  maybe you do."  </P> <P> She suggested that a piece might be as simple as a "10-foot spire with water  dripping down" or "three rocks from a quarry polished on one side with one or  three recirculating bubblers (fountains)."  </P> <P> Frankly, such pieces sound awfully bland and unimaginative. Wouldn't it be  better to hang onto the money and organize a private fund-raising campaign to  top off the budget to a more magnanimous size? Another source the city might  tap is its "in lieu" fund, a pool of 1% contributions by developers who elect  not to acquire a work of art for their property. This fund now totals $78,571.  </P> <P> Diane Shamash, public art program manager for the city of Seattle -- whose  percent-for-art program is one of the most celebrated in the nation -- points  out that "it's the planning that's critical." It's possible, she said, "if you  have a really good proposal," to raise more money later. "But you need somehow  to define the budget. You need to say $27,200 is the budget or that it is only  for the first phase.  </P> <P> "If we had $20,000 for a really major project, we'd use it for planning and  design. We'd fund the first phase and then . . . get the sponsoring (city)  department to fabricate the work out of construction funds" representing the  other 99% of the building project.  </P> <P> Shamash said Seattle has done some projects on a shoestring. "I don't think you  need $100,000 to do a great project," she added. "It depends a lot on the  design. If it's an interesting enough project" -- such as one in which teams of  artists get to collaborate with design professionals -- good artists will be  interested in competing.  </P> <P> So far, however, there is nothing particularly sexy about the Laguna Beach  project. Even the requirement that the piece contain a water element -- a  redundant component for a piece just a few blocks from the ocean, anyway --  sounds like more of a limitation than a challenge. It sounds, frankly, as  though the city was envisioning a demure pool or fountain that would simply  reinforce the kitsch status of a tourist town's art.  </P> <P> The city of Brea -- dotted with poorly sited, bland and hackneyed works of art  that are ludicrously out of scale with the environment and crafted by artistic  nonentities -- has already shown Orange County how not to conduct a  percent-for-art program. Is it too much to hope that Laguna Beach might try for  something really first-class, environmentally appropriate and delightfully  unconventional?  </P></p>

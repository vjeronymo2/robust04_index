			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by M. Abderrahmane: "Does the FIS Still Count in </F> the Field?"; first paragraph is EL WATAN introduction]    [Text] The threats contained in the latest communique  from the GIA [Armed Islamic Group] and directed at Hamas  [Islamic Society Movement] and Nahdah are more than eloquent.  After accusing them of being either hypocrites or "mukhabarat,"  the spokesman in Bonn promises a violent death for their leaders  as well as any leaders of the FIS [Islamic Salvation Front] who  might have the poor judgment to hold discussions with the  government. Are those threats the reason why the FIS has not  lived up to the terms of its deal with the government?    The communique dated from Bonn accuses Nahnah's party of  being in fact a tool of the regime because delegations  consisting of Hamas cadres held press conferences in Europe and  the Middle East regarding the situation in Algeria to deny the  existence of any holy war and say that those claiming to be war  veterans were simpleminded.    According to the GIA, those trips were sponsored in  collaboration with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a  circumstance that does not enhance Nahnah's image among the  armed groups already accusing him of collaboration with the  "junta" because he showed too much zeal for the dialogue  initiated by the CDN [National Dialogue Commission].    So following the contract that Said Makhloufi put out on  Abdallah Djaballah, the armed groups have now issued a new  sentence, this one against an Islamist leader because of his  receptiveness to a political solution. The communique reiterates  rejection of all dialogue with the government by denouncing any  member of the FIS "Majlis Echoura" [advisory council] who takes  part in such an initiative.    Is that the real reason for the failure of the arrangement  between Zeroual and the imprisoned Islamist leaders? According  to the office of the president, Abassi and Benhadj delegated  Djeddi and Boukhamkham to talk to the group leaders and achieve  a cease-fire, that being the main condition for holding new  elections as soon as possible.    One month after the release of those two members of the  "Majlis Echoura," there has been no tangible result to encourage  supporters of that initiative. Even worse, Boukhamkham is said  to have delivered certain inflammatory sermons encouraging armed  action and supporting certain group leaders whose barbarity has  seriously eroded convictions among the rank and file.    There are two possible explanations for the lack of desire  on  the part of the FIS leaders to keep their promise. The first has  to do with what the "boarders" at Blida Prison really want. Do  they want calm to be restored as long as they are in prison? The  content of the letter sent by Ali Benhadj to Chebouti, in which  he promised to place himself at the latter's disposal upon being  released from prison--a letter that got his lawyer Touati a  three-year prison term for smuggling it out--stuns those who  think there is a difference between the FIS' politicians and its  armed branch, whether that be the MIA [Armed Islamic Movement],  the HDI [Haraket addawla al islamiya], or even the GIA.    That multiplication of acronyms, which serves only to  appease  leadership ambitions and conceal sometimes bloody internal  struggles and squabbling among cliques, must not make us lose  sight of the fact that the methods, strategy, and objectives are  the same. Rejection of any idea of dialogue with the government,  rejection of any possible truce before the pure and simple  abdication of all those governing today, and trials for everyone  who participated in one way or another in interrupting the  electoral process are constants in every communication from the  armed groups, whether over the illegal radio station Wafa, in  the publications they issue in Europe thanks to their  intermediaries there, or the posters they put up on the walls of  mosques. What is the reason for the promise made to Zeroual to  halt terrorist acts--a promise implying tacit agreement to  participate in dialogue? Does it mean that the minister of  defense possesses a sufficiently persuasive gift of gab to make  Abassi and Benhadj go back on their word somewhere? The reasons  for all this might be found in the things that have been  successively left unsaid. Beginning with the CDN, which had  managed to convince everyone that the FIS would participate  through Hachani, for just a few hours, in the opening session of  the national conference, thus spicing up a meeting that was  promising to be dull. And also the office of the president,  which first contradicts remarks made by the party leaders and  then confirms them in a statement by its spokesman. There is no  assurance that the story of the meeting between Zeroual and the  shaykhs will someday be written.    The second explanation for what the office of the president  discreetly calls "nonimplementation of the promises made to  date" may be that the FIS leaders are in fact incapable of  controlling armed groups that deny them any authority over young  and bloodthirsty amirs who suffer no doubts.    However, there is still that murderous sound bite by Abassi  in his heyday, when he told the crowds astounded by laser  technology that: "I will turn my men loose on your tanks, and  they will eat them!" His statement showed that he already had  troops prepared for any eventuality and able to go from civil  disobedience to armed insurrection and that that army was simply  waiting for word from him--in other words, that he had  sufficient influence over the "Afghans" and the people he had  sent to join the pro-Iranian Lebanese Hezbollah in the Bekaa  Valley--and, last, that Chebouti was being exhibited at  political rallies by the FIS president as a postmortem surety  for armed Islamism in Algeria as incarnated by the Bouyali  symbol. All those factors tend to prove that Abassi and Benhadj  have influence over the armed groups, but there is a discrepancy  between what someone like Makhloufi or Redjam says and the  promise by the FIS leaders as announced by Bensalah during the  national conference and confirmed a few days later by Mihoubi in  the statement by the office of the president.    Does this indicate a tactical division of labor between  Islamist politicians and the Islamist military or--as is more  likely--an undeclared challenge to the authority of the shaykhs?  Beyond all those questions about whether Abassi and Benhadj are  capable of halting the terrorist acts, there is another question  that is of the greatest interest to observers: what are they  going to be offered in return?</p>

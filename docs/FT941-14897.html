			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Ratners shareholder wins damages A US arbitration panel has ordered underwriter CS First Boston to pay Dollars 37,500 (Pounds 25,100) to an American fund which invested in preferred stock of Ratners, the British jewellery group now known as Signet, not long before Ratners' credit rating was downgraded. It is the first case to be settled of several pending against CS First Boston and fellow underwriter Goldman Sachs over an issue of Ratners auction market preferred shares in 1991. There is also one case against Signet itself. The fund, CMB Realty Trust, bought Dollars 200,000 of the Ratners issue and had sought damages of Dollars 200,000, claiming First Boston had misrepresented the shares as a 'safe and secure investment with a very decent yield.' A panel from the National Association of Securities Dealers made no comment in making the award. It rejected CMB's request that CS First Boston void the trade and return its money. Signet shares rose 1p to 33 1/2 p yesterday. The suit against Signet from Glamorgan Coal, a US investor, is not expected to come to court for some time. In its 1993 accounts Signet said it did not consider that the claim would have a 'significant effect' on the company's finances. Yesterday Signet said the position had not changed since the accounts were published. Signet issued two tranches of auction market preferred shares in the US, the second in 1991, totalling Dollars 250m. Regular auctions of the shares set the interest rate on them and they are redeemable only at the company's option. When the group's financial difficulties deepened, the credit rating on the shares dropped and auctions failed, meaning that a fall-back rate of interest was set on Dollars 200m of the total. This is updated every four weeks, and is set at 250 per cent of a benchmark US commercial paper rate. Signet stopped paying the interest on the shares in January 1992. This has been rolled up since and now totals Pounds 65m. Signet cannot pay dividends on its ordinary shares until the interest on the preference shares has been paid. In the 1993 accounts there was a loss on distributable reserves of Pounds 65.9m. A capital restructuring is expected to address these losses. Mr James McAdam said last July that before a capital restructuring could be considered, the group had to 'get the trading line right'. Last week it published sales figures covering the crucial Christmas period, which Mr McAdam said indicated a return to profits was likely in the financial year ending this month.</p>

			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Christmas Food &amp; Drink: Books for tipplers - Wine The Larousse Encyclopedia of Wine, edited by Christopher Foulkes (Larousse, Pounds 30, 608 pages) invites comparison with the near-simultaneously published Oxford Companion to Wine by the FT's Jancis Robinson, reviewed here in October. But, the main value of the encyclopedia is as a manual and directly instructional work, essentially based on the wine countries of the world rather than an alphabetically planned reference work on a highly-detailed scale. After introductory pages on how it is organised, and an encouraging article by Michael Broadbent on how to enjoy wine, a long section starts with a brief history of wine and its varying production and ends with information on how to decant and serve wine, along with matching wine with food. Most of the rest of this solid volume is devoted to the wine countries, their regions, districts and appellations where these exist. France occupies 175 pages, the new world nearly 100. Short notes are provided on the leading, recommended growers. The articles are nearly all by British wine writers, listed at the end. The more lengthy contributions deserve more individual identification. The maps are excellent and the volume is competently produced: a useful work for the aspirant wine amateur and also for the more sophisticated drinker, looking perhaps for unknown wines, particularly in the New World. In 1971 I reviewed here - and have retained the original edition - of Hugh Johnson's World Atlas of Wine. So I am able to see in the new fourth edition, (Mitchell Beasley, Pounds 30, 320 pages) the great difference time and the development of wine production throughout the world have made in the intervening years, during which two further editions have been produced and a total of 7m copies sold. More than any other single wine book it has not only increased interest in wine but also demand. For, 23 years ago, supermarkets and off-licences that now sell most of wine in the UK, were in their infancy. (Marks &amp; Spencer started selling wine in 1973). More pictorially orientated than the Larousse, it contains all the essential information on the history and making of wine throughout the world, but also notes on looking after wine, serving and best temperature. In the persistent argument on the relative importance of terroir versus grape variety, largely supported in the New World, Hugh Johnson is firmly on the side of terroir, for which he argues cogently. The maps have been amplified and more clearly defined. France takes up the biggest wine-country section, with 89 pages, and is described in great detail and is well mapped. Germany, often undervalued, is well covered, but parts of Italy might have been alloted more space. Barolo - king of wines according to Italians - and Barbaresco are worth more than a page. Also, the leading vino da tavola contains 20 per cent Cabernet-Sauvignon not 10 per cent, and was first put on the market in 1971 not 1878. But these are tiny blemishes for a work that will certainly run into further editions and which can be fairly described as indispensable to all those seriously interested in wine. Ch Haut-Brion was probably the first of what later became the first-growth clarets of Bordeaux. Mentioned initially by Samuel Pepys in 1663, it has been the only chateau to lack an individual account. Unlike the books on Lafite, Latour and Margaux that were written by wine-writers, Haut-Brion (Faber &amp; Faber, hardback Pounds 25, 258 pages, paperback Pounds 9.99) it is by an academic author, Asa Briggs. He appears to have believed it necessary to intermingle the story of Bordeaux and its wine trade with that of the chateau, and this pads it out. It is planned in a confusing way, with early chapters on the place, the soil, the growers and wine, while leaving until later the main history of the families who owned it - from the Pontacs and the Fumels to the Dillons. Then, near the end, there is an odd chapter, entitled 'Times &amp; Seasons', which contains a good deal of history. Nothing is omitted, including an account of La Mission-Haut-Brion, acquired in 1983, but it is perhaps a jeroboam of a book whereas a magnum would have sufficed. The undeniable complexity of wine and wine drinking makes many introductory-books boring as they attempt, in a manner often hard to absorb, its many facets. But, with well-chosen, often specially commissioned illustrations and a clear text, Joanna Simon's Discovering Wine (Mitchell Beazley, Pounds 14.99, 160 pages) succeeds. It begins at the right point: on how to taste, serve, fit in with various foods and when to drink at maturity. This section is enhanced by attractive pictures of the author. Then follows a section on how wine is made, with particular attention to different grape varieties. After this follows an informative tour, well-illustrated, of the world's wine regions. Published in hardback in the mid-1980s, but now available in paperback, The Book of Wine Antiques by Robin Butler and Gillian Walkling (Antique Collectors' Club, Pounds 19.95, 286 pages) provides a highly informative guide to items such as decanters, wine funnels, corkscrews, tasters and coasters that may contribute to the pleasures of the table. There are also chapters on antique drinking glasses and bottle holders. Some 52 illustrations are in colour and 306 in black and white.</p>

			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / China's walls weaken: The Hong Kong visit of a top Beijing official Lu Ping, China's urbane official in charge of Hong Kong affairs, has not had an easy week. On his first visit to Hong Kong in nearly two-and-a-half years, Mr Lu, 67, has been pilloried by the colony's press for his refusal to meet Governor Chris Patten. To add insult to injury, he has had to use tradesmen's entrances to avoid the media. This is not the way a full member of the Chinese Communist party's central committee would expect to conduct himself when inspecting his area of responsibility. Mr Patten, for his part, has not missed an opportunity to take the moral high ground - even though Mr Lu's decision not to pay him a call still amounted to a snub. 'We would like Director Lu's visit to Hong Kong to be so enjoyable and successful that he comes back many times,' Mr Patten said yesterday. Mr Lu's visit was ostensibly to attend a ceremony marking the Bank of China's first issue of bank notes in the colony, and for meetings of the Preliminary Working Committee (PWC), a group of mainly Hong Kong businessmen and mainland officials, set up to discuss post-1997 issues. But Mr Lu's journey to Hong Kong is also meant to reassert his authority over China's Hong Kong policy - undermined by his long absence - and to signal an important shift in attitude. Beijing is shelving its policy of non-co-operation with Britain on Hong Kong affairs, which reached its height last year during talks on the colony's political development, and substituting a policy of selective co-operation. As Mr Tsang Yok-sing, chairman of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong, a pro-Beijing political party, puts it: 'Beijing realises that they can't cut all contacts with the UK and Hong Kong governments and achieve a smooth transfer of sovereignty in 1997.' Mr Tsang, also a leading member of the PWC, believes China has also given up hope of seeing Mr Patten recalled to London. This reasoning seems to strike a chord with the British Foreign Office. 'We have made more progress on practical issues in the past six weeks than we have in the past two years,' says one official. Illustrating this improvement in relations are the current talks about financing Hong Kong's new airport. Hopes have risen within the Hong Kong government that a workable agreement on financing the multi-billion-dollar project can be worked out before the Legislative Council (LegCo) rises for the summer recess in early July. On Wednesday - a day after Mr Lu said: 'I believe that we can reach an agreement on the airport acceptable to both sides' - China requested a formal meeting of the Joint Liaison Group's Airport Committee, the body charged with resolving the differences between the UK and China over airport finances. Further underlining China's interest in Hong Kong's continuing prosperity, Mr Lu found time to dine with some of the wealthiest local businessmen: Mr Li Ka-shing, chairman of two of Hong Kong's biggest companies; Mr David Li, chief executive of the Bank of East Asia; Mr Stanley Ho, Macao's casino tycoon; and Mr Cheng Yu-tong, chairman of New World, the property and construction company. 'Mr Lu is confident and in good spirits. It seems to me that he's enjoying all the trapings which go with his office - the police outriders and the reporters chasing him,' says one businessman who dined with the Chinese visitor. In terms of concrete achievements, Mr David Chu, a property developer who sits on the PWC, indicated that some previously intractable subjects might now be easier to resolve. He cited plans for a new Court of Final Appeal, the future use of military territory in the colony, and some civil service matters as examples of where co-operation may now be possible. But in spite of the new pragmatism, PWC members are adamant that the UK has lost influence by pursuing what they describe as a path of confrontation over Hong Kong's political development. Mr Chu says Britain's view will not now be sought on who should be the colony's first post-1997 'chief executive'; nor will China consult the UK on the appointment of the top 20 or so senior mandarins. Nevertheless Mr Lu, addressing businessmen yesterday, stressed that China would act in accordance with the Basic Law - its mini-constitution for Hong Kong, drawn up in consultation with the UK - when it resumes sovereignty. This suggests that fears of China taking a still tougher stance post-1997 are unfounded. From Mr Patten's point of view, the resumption of Sino-British co-operation may appear a vindication of his stance on political development, for which Britain's lack of involvement in the choice of his succesor - never likely to have been great - is a small price to pay. For their part, however, the Chinese remain sensitive to the idea that Mr Lu's visit is a tactical victory for Britain - and Mr Patten was careful to avoid public triumphalism. He is confident of meeting Mr Lu later this year. But that may be wishful thinking by a governor feeling the strains of China's boycott. Mr Patten may remain beyond the pale for the next three years.</p>

			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / World Bond Markets: Gilt market awaits chancellor's lead - Capital &amp; Credit What would it take in tomorrow's Budget to make the gilt-edged market really happy? There has been plenty of speculation about what the Chancellor may or may not have tucked up his sleeve: but if those in the gilt-edged market could have their way, there are a few important points on which they would like some reassurance. In one respect their prayers have been answered. Last Tuesday, the Bank of England delivered a half-point interest rate cut, lowering the base rate to 5.5 per cent from 6 per cent. That cut had been priced into the gilt market, although its timing came as a surprise since many had thought an interest rate cut was more likely to come in conjunction with the Budget or shortly afterwards. Now, while the gilt market would probably like to see a further cut in the base rate, most economists consider it extremely unlikely that there will be another cut at the time of the Budget. However, looking ahead, many in the market believe base rates could fall to 5 per cent by the first quarter of 1994, while Mr Roger Bootle, chief economist at Midland Global Markets, is putting his money on a 4 per cent base rate 'at some point next year'. With the focus temporarily off the base rate, the gilt market will be listening carefully for what Mr Kenneth Clarke has to say about certain important figures - namely inflation and the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR). The latest inflation figure - for October - came in at a better-than-expected 1.4 per cent, down from 1.8 per cent in September. 'The market will be looking for confirmation of a low-inflation background in the Budget speech . . . the inflation figures have been better than expected recently, and if Mr Clarke thinks this will continue, then gilts would be delighted,' says one gilt-edged market-maker. Mr Simon Briscoe, economist at SG Warburg Securities, believes it is vital for the chancellor to re-emphasise the 1 per cent to 4 per cent range for the inflation target (for the RPI excluding mortgage interest payments). 'It would be a huge mistake to be seen to be softening up on this, the centre-piece of post-ERM policy,' Mr Briscoe says. As for the other numbers, there has been plenty of talk in the market about fiscal tightening: estimates range from about Pounds 1bn to about Pounds 4bn. Mr Ifty Islam, UK economist at Merrill Lynch, argues there is probably a minimum amount of about Pounds 2bn which would keep the gilt market happy. 'Two billion pounds is a small tightening, but the main thing here is sentiment so, if the government tightens by less than that, the market will be disappointed. However, a net tax rise of Pounds 3bn-Pounds 4bn on top of the Pounds 6.725bn already announced would be taken quite well by the gilt market,' Mr Islam says. Overall, however, the market will be looking at the size of the PSBR with a view to just how much gilt funding the Bank of England will have to conduct in the remainder of this year and next year. Most economists expect the chancellor to scale back the original PSBR forecast for 1993-94 of Pounds 50bn to Pounds 45bn-Pounds 48bn, helped by a faster-than-expected recovery (which has lifted tax receipts) and lower debt-servicing costs. The initial reaction to a PSBR of Pounds 50bn was one of horror, and fear that the gilt market would be swamped with new supply. With the benefit of hindsight, the reaction was over-done, and the gilt market has coped well with heavy new supply. It coped so well, that the Bank has succeeded in funding most of this year's requirement. Even so, 'an expenditure undershoot would be good news', said Mr Briscoe. The market will want to see a reduction in the PSBR forecast for 1994-95. Back in March, a figure of Pounds 44bn was mooted. Now, economists in the City think it could be closer to Pounds 39bn-Pounds 40bn. In conjunction with these figures, the market would probably welcome a clarification on the funding calendar. The Bank has been forced to hold more frequent gilt auctions in recent months because of the amount of funding which had to be completed. However, some gilt specialists feel the time has come to re-think the procedure, given the low cover ratio at some recent auctions. 'In the last year, auctions and taps have accounted for roughly equal amounts of funding. While this gives maximum flexibility to the Bank, it means investors feel no great urge to bid in auctions as it is always perceived that a tap is just around the corner,' says Mr Briscoe. He suggests the Bank should consider moving to a system where it holds monthly auctions at which it sells smaller amounts of several different maturity stocks, as in France.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] On Monday [11 April], the Social Democratic Party  of Germany [SPD] Presidium -- like party chairman Rudolf  Scharping previously -- advocated the deportation of Kurdish  delinquents. However, it can only take place when an examination  in each individual case has shown that the person to be deported  neither has to fear torture nor capital punishment in Turkey,  the party leadership stated. The struggle for the Kurds'  self-determination has to be carried out with democratic and  nonviolent means. In particular, the valid German laws have to  be observed and respected, it was stated.    The SPD again criticized the FRG Government because of arms  supplies from former GDR stocks to Ankara. A government led by  the SPD will discontinue all deliveries of military material to  Turkey, it was stated.</p>

Air Strikes"]    [Text] Rome, 10 Jan (ANSA) -- Italy stands ready to provide  logistical support in the event of an air strike on Bosnia,  Defense Minister Fabio Fabbri said in a radio interview to be  aired Tuesday morning [11 January] but excerpts of which were  released here tonight.    With reference to the ongoing NATO summit in Brussels,  Fabbri  said that the Atlantic Alliance must be ready to intervene  energetically in Bosnia if called upon to do so, however he  noted that the final decision rests with the United Nations.    The defense minister voiced satisfaction with the fact that  the Bosnian question was being debated at the summit and  recalled that NATO has on several occasions stressed it was  willing to intervene with air strikes to protect humanitarian  convoys and to break the Serbian stranglehold on Sarajevo.    In any case, there is no contingency plan to send Italian  soldiers to Bosnia as the United Nations rightfully insists that  the participation of troops from neighboring nations is  undesirable, Fabbri added.</p>

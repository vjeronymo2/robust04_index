			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / Japanese business calls on west to counter rising yen JAPANESE business leaders yesterday called on the country's new government to seek concerted international intervention to stop the yen's rise against the dollar. They fear the yen's strength is threatening hopes of economic recovery in Japan. The yen yesterday broke through Y101 to the dollar for the first time in London trading. After closing in Tokyo at Y101.25, the currency reached a new postwar high of Y100.80 in European trading. It drifted back to close in London at Y101.05, but there was speculation the currency would break through the Y100 level this week. It eased to Y101.575 at the New York close and opened at Y101.41 in Tokyo. Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Keidanren, Japan's main business grouping, said the government should ask other economic powers to carry out concerted intervention in foreign exchange markets. Mr Hirohisa Fujii, who became finance minister in the coalition government formed last week, agreed that the rise was 'too rapid' and said he was consulting other nations. Central banks from Japan's partners in the Group of Seven leading industrial nations have shown no inclination to join the Bank of Japan in attempting to hold back the gains in the yen. The country's trade surplus is seen in the west as too high to warrant doing anything to assist Japanese export competitiveness. But as Mr Tadahiro Sekimoto, president of NEC, the electronics manufacturer, noted in a television interview last night, the economic slowdown leaves industry few options but to pare costs where possible and redirect output to products sought abroad. Industrialists were encouraged yesterday by an upward revision in industrial production data for June. The seasonally adjusted rise in output from May was put at 1.9 per cent compared with an earlier estimate of 1.3 per cent. On an unadjusted basis, output was down 4.6 per cent against June 1992, but better than the 5.1 per cent fall initially indicated. The ratio of inventories to sales was 1.1 per cent lower month-on-month, against the original 1.2 per cent. Depressed consumer demand was again evident in figures for July department store sales in the capital. These were down 9.5 per cent from a year earlier for a 17th successive fall.

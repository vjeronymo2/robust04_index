			<p>930723 FT  23 JUL 93 / Thunderstorms threaten Mississippi states HEAVY thunderstorms swept through Missouri and Illinois yesterday morning, putting new strains on the already waterlogged barriers holding back the Mississippi and its swollen tributaries. Weather forecasters predict five more inches of rain over the next three days, and see no sign of a break in the weather system that has stubbornly anchored itself over the Midwest. The Mississippi reached a crest this week at 47 feet on the St Louis depth gauge, nearly four feet higher than the previous record reached in 1973, but five feet short of the top of the city's 11-mile long floodwall. Hydrologists and weather forecasters believe that the river really has crested, despite the continued rain, but they warn that it could take weeks before it drops below flood stage. 'It looks like a three-tenths of a foot drop per day. We are now 17 feet above flood stage so it could take six or seven weeks to get back down,' said Mr Joe Schwenk of the Army Corps of Engineers in St Louis. As the water moves steadily downstream, records are being set in towns as far south as Cape Girardeau, but no more than slight flooding is expected south of Cairo, Illinois, where the Mississippi is joined by the Ohio River. Rainfall in the Ohio basin has been below normal this year. For river users, this year's flooding has been not just higher but more prolonged than in previous years. 'This is a flood which really started back in April,' said Mr J. Thomas Dunn, general manager of Gateway Riverboat Cruises, the oldest excursion boat company on the Mississippi. High water in April stopped Gateway's operations for five weeks, and the river never dropped much more than five feet below flood stage before rising again at the end of June. Mr David Lane, of Canal Barge Company in New Orleans, warns that even though he has been told river traffic can resume at 38 feet, 8 feet above flood stage, it will be a long time before operations get back to normal. New shoals will have formed, navigation buoys will have been washed away, and barges will probably have to travel at reduced speeds to avoid endangering already weakened levees with their wakes. 'Waiting for it to come down is just the beginning of it,' says Mr Lane, whose company has managed to divert traffic for one customer up the Ohio River but has otherwise had to halt its operations on the river. In normal times the Mississippi carries around 15 per cent of all freight in the US, but an estimated 2,000 barges and 50 tugs are now tied up by the flooding.</p>

			<p><P> May 12, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: RETALIATION SEEN AS MOTIVE FOR SLAYING  </P> <P> Gang members who were apparently retaliating for an earlier shooting at a  Willowbrook house drove by the same house and opened fire with a shotgun,  killing a man outside, sheriff's deputies said Thursday.  </P> <P> Michael Perales, 23, was in the driveway of the house when he was shot in the  chest by one of a barrage of shots fired from a passing car about 8 p.m.  Wednesday, Sheriff's homicide Lt. Dan Burt said.  </P> <P> The house, at Piru Street and Willowbrook Avenue, is a known hangout for gang  members, but it was not immediately determined if Perales was affiliated with a  gang, Burt said.  </P> <P> However, he apparently died as a result of gang rivalries that had triggered a  shooting at the same house Tuesday night. In that shooting, someone in the  house had fired at a passing car, Burt said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 25, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> HIS DESK SOLD FOR $12 MILLION, BUT 'VAN GOGH OF MAHOGANY' DIED POOR  </P> <P> Financially speaking, when John Goddard died his shirt didn't quite meet his  pants.  </P> <P> On balance, that is, he was broke. Having 15 children may not have helped. Too  bad. Just 204 years later, a desk almost certainly made by him has been sold  for $11 million -- plus 10% commission, for a total of more than $12 million.  </P> <P> John Goddard (1723-85) was a cabinetmaker. He was the unsung Vincent van Gogh  of mahogany. It was die now, get rich later. Much later.  </P> <P> In the 1760s Goddard thought, correctly, that he was making a handsome bookcase  desk for John Nicholas Brown, a Providence merchant. Brown did not know that  the desk would make tidal waves in the antiques market in June, 1989, when his  descendant and namesake sold the family heirloom through a New York auction  house.  </P> <P> The highest bid of $12.1 million was quadruple the previous world record price  paid for a single piece of furniture. That was $2.97 million, paid in 1988 for  a Louis XVI table that once belonged to Marie Antoinette.  </P> <P> Colonial cabinetmakers, even superstars such as Goddard, didn't die rich. Their  customers did. The Goddards served them in death as in life, eking out a living  between masterpieces by making coffins -- or hammer handles or cheap furniture  for export to the Caribbean, whence came the expensive mahogany logs they used  to make fine pieces.  </P> <P> Goddard's home, one of many Colonial buildings in this seaport, still stands on  2nd Street near Pine. So does his shop adjacent to the three-story, gabled  house. It's about as big as a one-car garage -- one compact car, that is.  </P> <P> John Alden, the Mayflower immigrant, was the first cabinetmaker in the  Colonies. His product was crude as a broadax, rough-hewn for the ages. As the  Colonies prospered, hardscrabble utility began surrendering to refinement.  Quality furniture became a confirmation of status, gentility, wealth.  </P> <P> And wealth in the Colonies was concentrated at the seaports. Philadelphia,  second-largest city in the British Empire, was the capital of cabinetmaking.  Newport by the mid-1700s was home to 11,000 people. It had more than 50 rum  distilleries and a growing class of entrepreneurs becoming rich in the  triangular trade of rum, slaves and sugar cane.  </P> <P> Newport also had a family of Quakers named Townsend and Goddard. Three  generations of Townsends and Goddards intermarried both nuptially and  vocationally, producing a line of some 20 cabinetmakers and a golden age of  furniture -- wooden Parthenons for the drawing rooms of the rich who could  afford the best and found it, providentially, within walking distance.  </P> <P> John Goddard was born in Dartmouth, Mass., son of a shipwright, one of the  crafts that gave rise to Colonial cabinetmaking. By age 20 he was master of the  sloop Bashsheda, plying between Philadelphia and Newport. In 1746 he married  Hannah, daughter of cabinetmaker Job Townsend. Goddard's brother, James, also  married a daughter of Job's. The brothers began to learn "the art, trade and  mystery" of cabinetmaking.  </P> <P> The first quality furniture in America was either imported from Britain or  copied from English books of design such as Thomas Chippendale's "The Gentleman  and Cabinetmaker's Director," published in 1754. Gradually, each of the  American port cities evolved its own furniture style.  </P> <P> Philadelphia's furniture the most elegant and richly carved. New York was an  unadorned and "put it there" kind of town, and so was its furniture. Boston,  already in decline as a seaport, produced a frugal style that resisted change  as well as ostentation. And in Newport, which had 67 cabinetmakers during the  century, the best, remember, were Quakers.  </P> <P> The tools of their trade were almost prehistoric by today's standards.  </P> <P> "All you needed were sharp planes, saws and chisels," said Robert Emlen, the  curator who shipped Goddard's desk off the auction block. "They finished wood  with scrapers, pumice and rottenstone or sharkskin -- but for that you had to  find a shark.  </P> <P> "Screws were expensive, and they were only used where absolutely needed," said  Jeff Moore, who restores furniture for the Newport Preservation Society. "They  used (animal) hide glue -- it's still holding. Blacksmiths made files, and they  had molding planes and jointer planes and rifflers and sandpaper made out of  crushed glass glued to paper. They weren't fools. They did it the easy way  wherever they could."  </P> <P> Humble woods were used where they wouldn't be seen, but the visible mahogany  surfaces were flawlessly carved and dovetailed.  </P> <P> Future cabinetmakers apprenticed for seven years, beginning at about age 13.  After the dog work they became journeymen, traveling from job to job until they  acquired enough rifflers and planes and sharks to open their own shops.  Roughly, it took a journeyman eight days to make a table four feet long, six  days to make a plain desk, 22 days for a highboy.  </P> <P> Each city's style became subtly distinctive, an aid to future antiquarians  since few pieces in the Chippendale era were signed. It was an anonymous  business presumably because everybody knew who made what. Ball-and-claw feet  were squared off at the bottom in New York, carved with pronounced knuckles in  Philadelphia, lacked webbing between the talons in Newport.  </P> <P> The Townsends and Goddards became known for their block-front furniture, with  convex panels surrounding a third, concave panel and topped with a carved  scallop shell, a common adornment, along with stars and radiating suns. It was  a style that came to Newport from Italy by way of Boston.  </P> <P> Customarily, several craftsmen contributed to a block-front desk-bookcase: the  lathe turner, the brass hardware maker and sometimes the carver. They would  turn over their pieces to the cabinetmaker, who put them all together and got  credit for the final product. So it was, presumably, with John Goddard's  $12.1-million block-front desk, although he probably did the carving himself.  </P> <P> Actually, no one is positive that Goddard made the desk. It is unsigned. "It's  a reasonably good bet he made it, but we're not sure," Emlen said.  </P> <P> Aside from the distinctive touches on the piece, there are letters between  Goddard and the Browns, who were of such importance and wealth that the College  of Rhode Island was renamed Brown University in their honor. A 1763 letter to  Goddard from Nicholas's brother, Moses, accuses the cabinetmaker of falling  behind on an order and of working for another client when he should have been  finishing Brown's furniture.  </P> <P> Goddard the Quaker wrote back, hat in hand, that Moses should understand he had  "to keep my boys Imploy'd . . . so I hope thou will think better of thy  friend." He went on to describe a "Chest on Chest of Drawers and a Sweld  (block) front which are costly and ornamental."  </P> <P> Such a costly and ornamental desk-bookcase, now known as a secretary, might  have sold then for 400 pounds. Nicholas, when he died in 1791, left a "bookcase  with books" -- probably the very same one -- valued at 95 pounds in the widely  fluctuating currency of that day. That was a high value for the times.  </P> <P> There were 10 such desks made. One was lost in a fire; eight are in museums.  The Brown desk had remained in the family from the day it was made, in about  1767. After it was moved to the ultimate Brown family home in Providence in  1814, it left there only twice, both times on loan for an exhibit.  </P> <P> When he died, Goddard left "all my stock of mahogany" to his sons "to be worked  up for the support of my wife and minor children." A year later, the Newport  Mercury carried a sad epitaph, a notice that Goddard, "represented insolvent .  . . all those indebted to said estate are desired to make immediate Payment . .  ." And so he faded into obscurity.  </P> <P> The desk, meanwhile, was passed down through the eldest Brown son and gradually  acquired the status of a "family icon," said Emlen, "a pinnacle of the family  fortune. The Browns had the means to change the interior decor every 20 or so  years, but the desk always remained."  </P> <P> For years it had received little more notice than Goddard himself. Then in  1913, it was mentioned in Vincent Lockwood's "Colonial Furniture in America."  Goddard was similarly rediscovered, as were his town and his works.  </P> <P> Newport had been invaded by the British during the Revolution and 400 homes  were torn down for firewood. In the aftermath the town languished, its motto  being "Eat it up, make it do, do without." In this environment, old furniture  stayed at home and out of antique shops. As the mahogany took on the  blood-maroon, glowing patina of age, the cabinetmakers of Newport were recalled  from their graves as "craftsmen (whose) output in quality, design and  originality (was) unsurpassed by any other urban or rural setting throughout  the world."  </P> <P> The Goddard desk, almost 10 feet high, rose above the finicky, precious details  in the auction house catalogue: "molded scroll pediment . . . fluted urn flame  finials . . . stop-fluted quarter columns . . . shell-covered prospect door . .  . scroll-carved bracket foot . . . ."  </P></p>

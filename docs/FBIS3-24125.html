			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by M.S. Zotov, general director of the Executive </F> Council of the Energy Association of Independent Commercial  Banks, under the rubric "Competent View": "On Perfecting the  System of Banks and Banking"]    [Text] In two and a half years the Russian banking system  has undergone great changes, drawing considerably closer to a  market economy. About 2,000 commercial banks with more than  3,500 branches are already in operation (the branches of the  Savings Bank are not included). Banking structures such as  mortgage banks and trading houses have already appeared.    Banking associations are being created in the interests of  concentrating the capital of banks to achieve investment  objectives. Undoubtedly, the associations will play a great role  in the stabilization of the economy, the reproductive process,  and the development of the priority sectors of the fuel and  energy complex, enterprises of the metallurgical complex, and  others. Some banks have reached world standards or come  considerably closer to them. Mosbiznesbank, Promstroybank,  Elektrobank, Promstroybank (St. Petersburg), Kuzbassprombank,  Kredobank, and others (a total of 30-40 banks) may be considered  such. However, this is extremely insufficient. The process of  perfecting banking establishments should be stepped up.    Despite the successes noted, we are still far from  accomplishing all the tasks in the area of perfecting credit  extension, monetary regulation, and settlements. Major  miscalculations and omissions have occurred during the period of  restructuring of the banking system and of upgrading its  technologies. At the first stage, many banks were created under  ministries and enterprises and were used by them as a channel to  procure funds. Many legal and other important issues have not  been fine-tuned. In view of this, urgent measures are needed to  enhance the role of the Central Bank of Russia and of commercial  banks in regulating the economy.    The priority of national rather than commercial objectives  should be the fundamental platform of the Central Bank. For this  reason the Central Bank and its organization should not directly  engage in the extension of credit to enterprises. Otherwise they  will acquire their own commercial objectives which may run  counter to national ones.    Proceeding from this fundamental premise, the Energy  Association of Independent Commercial Banks considers it  necessary to revise the structure of the main directorates and  divisions of the Central Bank. There is no need to have Central  Bank subdivisions in each oblast and rayon. Nine to 10 main  territorial directorates would be quite sufficient. On 9  November 1993 the Energy Association submitted proposals to the  Government of the Russian Federation concerning the above issue,  as well as the issue of the establishment of an independent  credit committee which should not report to the government or  the Central Bank.    This act was caused by the need to establish order and  discipline in compliance with financial and other legislation,  as well as with the rules for credit, monetary, and settlement  operations. Systematic control by the credit committee and the  Central Bank over the operation of commercial banks will become  the most important guarantee of liquidity in the banking system,  smoothness of payments, and stability of the financial status of  companies and associations.    It is necessary to create a council in the Central Bank of  Russia which would develop policy in the area of monetary  circulation, credit extension, settlements, and stabilization of  the ruble and its convertibility. The entire range of these  issues should be coordinated with the socioeconomic policy of  the state. We should be guided by strategic tasks in the area of  the economy and the tax policy developed by the government. In  essence, at issue is the policy council defining major economic  problems to which it is necessary to apply credit, thus  facilitating the accomplishment of socioeconomic tasks and the  stabilization of monetary circulation. The council would include  four or five representatives of commercial banks, three or four  representatives of industry and agriculture, and two or three  representatives of the economic sciences. All of them would be  confirmed by the government. It is feasible to include in the  council specialists from the Ministry of Finance and the  Ministry of the Economy in a consultative capacity. The council  should be headed by the chairman of the Central Bank of Russia.  The council would submit its analytical studies and proposals to  the Board of the Central Bank and the Government of the Russian  Federation. The decision to create the council would be adopted  by a special edict of the president. We should not wait for the  adoption of the Law on Banks and Banking to do this.    Funds allocated by the government from the budget or  received  in the form of credit from other states under intergovernment  agreements for investment in special-purpose programs in  priority sectors and other key undertakings (conversion, new  development, major scientific discoveries, and so on) would be  financed through the State Investment Bank which, in the  interests of a general state investment policy, should be  subordinated to the Ministry of Finance. It should not be  directly involved in raising funds; however, the bank may  finance individual facilities and programs while attracting the  capital and resources of commercial banks. Such financing should  be provided on a competitive basis. In this situation, the state  would act through the Investment Bank as a catalyst, influencing  investment and attracting private capital in the national  interest. This will considerably enhance the role of credit in  the reproduction of fixed assets.    Now about the system of commercial banks. Many of them are  unable to fully support the interests of companies and  associations because of insignificant joint stock and ownership  capital. At present, credit support is mainly provided for  brokerage operations and the generation of high rates of profits  by banks, whereas the stabilization of the economy, its  development, and the generation of a high rate of profit by  economic entities should be the main goals of operation of the  banks.    Perfecting the structure of commercial banks is the most  acute issue. The creed of a bank is to be a reliable partner to  its clients. The interpretations of goals and tasks in line with  this would indeed facilitate the strengthening of the economy  and the stabilization of the monetary system. This is why  measures are necessary to perfect the system of commercial  banks, to reinforce discipline, and to enhance their  responsibility. For example, it would be feasible for the  Central Bank, jointly with auditors, to audit the operations of  some commercial banks. The operation of the banks and their  final results cannot be separated from production, which has  declined catastrophically. Many plants are shutting down, while  the assets and profits of banks are growing. Some banks allow  debit balances to occur. This is the most egregious violation of  financial discipline which exacerbates inflationary processes.  Licenses to engage in banking operations should be revoked on  account of this, as well as for deviations from the principles  of extending credit to material production, and such banks  should be transferred to the class of subsidiary banks or  branches. The actions of the Central Bank should be resolute in  this instance.    The interests of economic stabilization, the reproductive  process, and technical progress require that the capital of  banks be concentrated. In conjunction with this, new banking  structures should be formed--banking associations, banking  finance companies, and other banking structures. Banking  associations should be created on a joint-stock basis. Banks,  insurance companies, financial companies, and financial  industrial groups should be their founders.    Taking into account the size of the territory of Russia, it  is feasible to create territorial commercial and local banks  that will service regions of the country. There may be nine or  10 such territorial banks. Their task would be to ensure the  raising of funds and to marshal them for the development of the  economies of their regions. It appears to us that issues such as  price equalization and a switch to operations without subsidies  from the budget will be resolved faster in the regions. The  regional banks may become the nerve centers for ensuring the  economic information necessary to evaluate the general economic  development of the regions, as well as that of individual  clients. This is also very important for the bank itself in  devising a strategy and action plan for both the long term and  shorter periods of time.    In view of the great significance of the task of stabilizing  monetary circulation, reining in inflation, and reducing prices  for consumer goods, it is necessary to sustain this area in  every way possible with credit, and tax and interest-rate  incentives. Banks that allocate 10-15 percent of internal  resources to set up shops producing consumer goods should have  the right to have this proportion of the resources exempted from  the payment of taxes.    Since the Savings Bank has the most extensive chain of  branches, it is necessary to assign to it the task of  facilitating the development of small businesses through credit.  This solution will make it possible to make considerable  progress on this issue and to saturate the market with the  necessary goods. Of course, the interests of depositors should  be taken into account in the process. In conjunction with this,  a norm should be set in keeping with which resources should be  allocated for credit.    Credit and the interest rate policy should be used as  instruments to implement economic development, taking into  account the specifics of its individual stages in devising  concrete approaches and measures to carry them out. Instruments  should be developed which make it possible to pursue a credit  and monetary policy by way of controlling the emission of money.    We should ensure that the operation of the entire banking  system, in cooperation with the state organs of government, be  directed toward accomplishing the strategic tasks of economic  development of Russia. In conjunction with this, it is important  to continuously analyze the economic situation in the country  and factors that influence changes in it. Based on this, the  necessary measures should be taken within the limits of one's  jurisdiction, and issues that require government decisions  should be referred to the government for consideration. To this  end, the Central Bank and commercial banks should have highly  skilled specialists-analysts on their staff.    For the purposes of objective assessment and substantiated  measures to regulate monetary circulation (cash and noncash) it  appears feasible to poll, on a quarterly basis, large and  medium-size corporations and associations on issues of trend  projection. To the same end, the banks should review existing  indexes of prices for certain commodity groups for corresponding  periods, with a considerable number of enterprises being covered.    The Central Bank should vigorously influence the  restructuring of the economy of the country in keeping with the  requirements of the market and the strategic tasks of the state  by way of regulating credit resources and establishing  substantiated, differentiated norms and interest rates.    It is important to invigorate the extension of credit that  would promote the intensification of production and the  development of market relations, stabilization of monetary  circulation, and prevention of illegitimate credit expansion. It  is necessary for the Central Bank to establish a firm limit on  the increment of credit. Limitations should be based on  realistic calculations which take into account increments in the  volume of production, sales, and the number of economic entities  served. The role of credit in investment should be enhanced  sharply; the proportion of credit should be brought to 20-30  percent of the total amount of capital investment (at present,  it stands at 3.5 percent). It is feasible for commercial banks  to allocate up to 30 percent of resources to the long-term  credit fund (FDK), and to use these resources first of all for  the retooling and upgrading of the production sphere. In cases  in which economic entities do not have sufficient internal funds  for capital investment, they should be granted the right to  effect accumulation in the FDK account. Once 70 percent of the  amount necessary to make capital investment in the envisioned  facility is attained, the bank should open credit for the  remainder of the amount. In this instance, the bank would set  the interest rate 30 percent below the average market rate. If  accumulation in the FDK account was effected over two or three  years, the interest rate may be lowered by 40-50 percent.    Limitations on credit for banks (and their branches) should  be introduced in the interests of reinforcing monetary  circulation and stabilizing the economy. At issue are limits on  special-purpose allocations to carry out the programs of  priority enterprises; limits on regular credit to be extended to  medium-size enterprises and for uses with the short recovery of  funds; limits of consumer credit (including that for the  development of small businesses and housing construction); and  regular limits for brokerage and other purposes.    Along with the setting of norms for the excess of credit  indebtedness over the capital of the bank (20-fold at present),  certain norms for the issuance of large loans should be  established (for example, five to seven large loans should not  be greater than three to four times the excess, and all large  loans--greater than six to eight times the size of ownership  capital). The practice of the last three years indicates that  95-97 percent of credit resources are issued for periods of one  to three months for brokerage and current uses by enterprises,  which causes economic and financial complications in the  operation of enterprises and associations. The introduction of  limits is a temporary measure devised for a period of  transition. However, it will provide an opportunity to orient  the bank toward production which is absolutely necessary in the  existing economic situation.    As a rule, credit resources would be provided to commercial  banks against the pledge of enterprise securities. This would be  one of the measures of real backing which is necessary to  stabilize monetary circulation.    It appears to us that the Central Bank of Russia should have  a clear-cut program for stabilizing monetary circulation and  reinforcing the convertibility of the ruble. This program should  call for a phased approach to the attainment of the goals set,  as well as measures that commercial banks should take. It is  necessary to envision in the program the gradual abandonment of  centralized resources. All budget support should be provided  directly through the financial organs.    Of course, the above does not exhaust the entire multitude  of  issues of perfecting the banking industry. However, we are  convinced that it is necessary to solve the problems that have  been touched upon in this article. We believe that we will meet  with understanding from the broad banking community, and that  bankers will contribute considerably to accomplishing the task  of stabilizing the economy, which is vital for our country.</p>

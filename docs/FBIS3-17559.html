The message was circulated on March 26.    "I am gratified to note that the leadership of Russia has  promptly responded to my letter and expressed concern over the  latest aggravation of the conflict in Abkhazia.    "We support the proposal expressed in the Russian  Government's message to resume talks and are prepared to  continue them in Moscow in the coming days", Shevardnadze  emphasised.    The Georgian leader voiced conviction that Russia can exert  an active influence and play a positive role in a settlement of  the Abkhazian problem, primarily in securing the return of more  than 300,000 refugees to their homes.    "I am confident that the authorities of the two countries  will remain true to the accord signed in Tbilisi on February 3  and will accomplish the major mission to implement them. This  is fully consonant with the consideration expressed by Boris  Yeltsin about the historic necessity for strategic cooperation  between Georgia and Russia", Shevardnadze said.</p>

			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Growing regional divisions threaten Italy's two main parties: Socialists and Christian Democrats face erosion of support A MILANESE what he understands by a 'model 740' and the reply is: 'A tax form, of course.' Ask a Roman and the reply is: 'A Volvo.' Ask a Neapolitan and he says quizzically: 'You mean twenty minutes to eight?' Ask a Sicilian and he replies: 'I've never heard of that calibre before]' Though a Milanese joke, this stereotyping of Italians encapsulates the enormous distance in perceptions which northerners see separating them from both the government in Rome, and the rest of the country in the south. At its simplest the north works and generates the money which is spent frivolously by Rome: the Neapolitans can scarcely get up in the morning to do an honest day's work, while the Sicilians are locked in a time warp of crime. Despite a blanket of prosperity now covering Italy, and despite the huge sums of money pumped into the south to redistribute income in the post-war period, the north-south gap is growing. This divide promises to be a central element in the campaign which has just begun for general elections on April 5. Northern political frustrations have found a voice and a movement in the form of the populist Lombard League. The League's platform is a return to 'clean government', tighter controls on state spending, more money channelled to the north, and a social policy that tightens controls on immigration. Its base is the industrial heartland of cities in Lombardy such as Brescia and Bergamo; but its appeal has spread across into Piedmont, the Veneto, parts of Liguria and even further south in Emilia Romagna and Tuscany. The emergence of the League into national politics over the past five years, operating on a loose structure of regional 'leagues', might have been contained but for two factors. First, the appeal of the two main government parties, the Christian Democrats (DC) and the Socialists (PSI) is declining. Second, the disappearance of the Communist party last year and its replacement by the Party of the Democratic Left (PDS) has created a void for the once-powerful opposition vote of the left. As a result these elections are likely to rewrite the political geography of Italy. In the absence of reliable opinion polls, the best gauge of the success of the League is the party's performance in municipal elections last November in Brescia, one of the richest cities in Italy and long run by the DC. The League obtained the largest single share of the vote - 24.4 per cent against the DC's 24.3 per cent and 10.3 per cent for the Socialists. The swing in vote when seen against the last general elections of 1987 was enormous. Then, the League had only managed to win 1.6 per cent of the vote and the DC 32 per cent. Another element to the Brescia poll was the collapse of the Communist vote in the period since the 1987 general election. From being the second-largest party four years ago with 21 per cent of the vote, the newly-formed PDS gathered less than 10 per cent. With the northern business community and parts of the Catholic hierarchy strongly behind the League, the pattern of Brescia results could be repeated across a swathe of northern Italy. The Christian Democrat vote, and that of the Socialists and former Communists, is also likely to be eroded by protest votes going to the Greens and well-organised minority groups such as the Pensioners Party. Nationwide, the former Communist vote, the second-largest in 1987 with 26 per cent, is expected to be slashed. The PDS itself accepts its share of the vote will fall sharply in all areas save the traditional 'red' belt in Emilia Romagna, Tuscany and Umbria. And the PDS has to contend with the hardliners among the former Communists who have formed the Reconstituted Communist Party which could account for 15 per cent of its former vote. The decline of support for the DC and the PSI may well be limited to the north and centre of the country. Especially in the south, which has more than 35 per cent of the electorate, these two parties still hold the purse strings and control patronage, all important when the state is the motor of the economy. They also enjoy many dubious links with organised crime whose political influence cannot be ignored in these parts. In poor regions such as Baslicata, the DC held 46 per cent of the vote in 1987 and marginally increased this share in regional elections two years ago. The PSI also improved its share of the vote in the 1990 regional elections in the south by almost 5 per cent. This pattern was confirmed last year in Sicily's regional elections, which saw the DC increase their support from 39 to 43 per cent. The increase was despite the emergence of a new party of clean government, La Rete (The Net) backed former Christian Democrats, ex-Communists and members of the Catholic church, with 8 per cent of the vote. If these trends are repeated in the general elections against a background of frustration with a political system in need of change, voters may be tempted to flirt more with small parties that appeal to specific interests - such as regional parties in Sardinia and Alto Adige or the Greens. At the same time the Christian Democrats and Socialists could come become 'meridionalised' parties, identified with their strongholds in the south out of touch with the aspirations of the north.</p>

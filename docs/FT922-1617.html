			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / France (21): A flavour of sour grapes - The economic impact of falling wine prices THERE was a big bang late one night at Coursan railway station a few weeks ago. An explosive device blew up part of the points system. The railway between Narbonne and Beziers was out of action until the damage was repaired. The stranded passengers at Coursan station had become the latest casualties of the problems of France's wine industry. The explosive had been placed by a band of militant winegrowers protesting against the fall in prices, the latest blow for an industry which has, for the past year, been in deep financial difficulty. The wine trade is now struggling against a vicious cycle of rising stocks and dwindling demand which could catalyse significant changes in the size and structure of one of France's largest industries. Only a few years ago the picture looked very, very different. The 1980s were a decade of almost unalloyed success for France's wine makers. They not only benefited from the expansion of important export markets, notably the US and Japan, but also from three years of wonderful wines in 1988, 1989 and 1990. The vintages of those years were high in quality, but also in quantity. This left the market awash with fine wine when the global economic slowdown began to bite at the end of the 1980s and demand declined. The negociants, who buy wine from the growers and sell it on to the retail sector, found it difficult to persuade their customers to accept the high prices they were charging for the prime vintages of 1988 and 1989. They found it even more difficult to sell the lowlier wines from 1987. By the time the 1990 vintage came on the market the wine trade was in trouble. When the wine growers uncorked their 1991 vintages earlier this year, the situation was much worse. The negociants were still burdened by stocks of unsold wine and they faced the additional problem of scores of unwanted cases returning from the US, popping up in French supermarkets sometimes still bearing their US customs labels. The only consolation for the wine industry was that 1991 was a small harvest, owing to the spring frosts and the long hot summer. Industry cynics are pinning their hopes on another paltry harvest this year, which would have the advantage of alleviating the stock problem. However, it could create serious cashflow difficulties for some companies which will need the proceeds of 1992 sales to fund their businesses in the coming year. The beneficiaries are, of course, the wine drinkers, who have been able to buy really good wines at bargain prices for the first time in years. Some negociants are so desperate to reduce their stocks that they have been off-loading top wines - such as Chateau Cheval Blanc, Chateau d'Yquem and Chateau Margaux - on to supermarkets. Meanwhile, the industry's problems are mounting. Even the prestigious Bordeaux region has been hit. A couple of small merchants have closed. Some of the grandest chateaux are up for sale. The sales and closures seem set to accelerate this year particularly if, as the wine trade suspects, poor sales of the 1991 wines aggravate the cashflow problems of the wine growers and their negociants. At the same time the French industry faces increased competition from foreign wines - from over the border in Spain and further afield in Australasia, eastern Europe and the newly respectable South Africa. These wines tend to be better attuned to the modern palate - being lighter and fruitier - than the heavy, old French wines. France also has the problem that the majority of its wines are reds, while latter-day wine drinkers tend to prefer whites. These competitive pressures, coupled with the general trend against alcoholic drinks, even in France itself, where sales of high quality wines fell last year for the first time in more than a decade, will intensify the long-term pressure on the French wine industry. Perhaps the only positive aspect of its present plight is that it should accelerate the process of rationalisation required by the industry if it is to prosper in the future. In brutal terms the industry is too big and too diffuse, being fragmented between too many tiny companies. The way ahead is to plough up the unprofitable acres churning out poor-quality plonk - chiefly heavily subsidised small holders and co-operatives in the south - and for the rest of the industry to consolidate into a smaller number of larger, more powerful companies. This process is already under way. A European Commission initiative to reduce France's wine growing area by 500,000 hectares over the next five years should mop up many of the unprofitable grape growers. Meanwhile, the technological advances in wine production, which have already wrought impressive improvements in quality and productivity, should strengthen the survivors. Similarly, the industry is already consolidating. The 1980s saw a stream of acquisitions and amalgamations in which powerful global drinks groups, such as Suntory of Japan and Allied-Lyons of the UK, invested in French wine. This has already helped the industry in the present recession, given that the new investors tend to take a longer-term view than their predecessors. These changes are likely to spread to the industry's structure. Traditionally it has been divided between a series of specialised businesses  -the wine growers, or viticulteurs, and the negociants. But these distinctions are being eroded. Some negociants are becoming involved with wine production and some viticulteurs in sales. Chateaux Lafite, Latour and Mouton-Rothschild in Bordeaux all already operate their own negociants to sell some of their wines. The consensus in the industry is that these changes will continue in the future, so that the French are better prepared for the rigours of life in the international wine market of the 1990s.</p>

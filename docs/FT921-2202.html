			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / RVI learns from its experience The problems at Mack Trucks are only too familiar to Renault Vehicules Industriels (RVI), its French owner, writes William Dawkins in Paris. Less than 10 years ago RVI was one of French industry's costliest headaches. Its experience in trimming costs and improving quality means RVI feels qualified to do the same to Mack. From 1983 to 1986, the Lyon-based group lost FFr7.5bn (Pounds 760m), as it entered the recession with surplus capacity and a too large workforce. In seven years, it shed nearly 13,000 jobs to about 28,000 by the end of last year; improved training; and cut inventories. RVI nearly went bankrupt before its restructuring took effect. But it responded to the upturn with a profits recovery in the late 1980s, helped by lower break-even. When the latest downturn hit, RVI suffered a relatively small loss, of FFr102m in 1990. It edged back to profit of FFr23m net last year. Mr Jean-Pierre Capron, RVI's chairman, is convinced the Mack revival plan is paying off. He points to a 16 per cent average rise in productivity in the past year. 'More than ever a big manufacturer needs to be present in north America,' he said.</p>

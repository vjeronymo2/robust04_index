			<p><P> November 10, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> GAGLIANO MOVES CLOSER TO STATE RECORD BUT MONROE BOWS TO VAN NUYS, 17-10  </P> <P> Monroe High kicker Rachel Gagliano kicked a field goal and an extra point  Thursday afternoon, but her efforts weren't enough for the visiting Vikings,  who fell to Van Nuys, 17-10 in a Mid-Valley League game. Gagliano has scored 10  points this season, putting her within a point of the state record for most  points by a girl in a season.  </P> <P> Mia Labowitz of San Diego High converted eight of nine extra-point attempts and  kicked a 32-yard field goal to set the record in 1987.  </P> <P> Van Nuys running back Diallo Frazier broke a 10-10 tie when he capped a  seven-play, 65-yard drive with a 25-yard touchdown run with 8:44 to play.  </P> <P> Harold Boudreaux opened the scoring for the Wolves on a five-yard run in the  second quarter, but Monroe running back Sean Bell answered with a 95-yard  touchdown on the ensuing kickoff.  </P> <P> Cuneyt Karacuha also scored for Van Nuys, kicking a 35-yard field goal in the  third quarter to give the Wolves a 10-7 lead.  </P> <P> "The kids have been really supportive," said Annette Gagliano, Rachel's mother.  "I know that they (the team) were really aware of the record going into the  game today, and they've been just terrific with her. I think they want her to  break the record as much as she does."

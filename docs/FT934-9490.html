			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / International Company News: Aiwa doubles pre-tax profits AIWA, a medium-sized Japanese audio-visual maker, has outperformed some of the giants in the electronics industry, writes Michiyo Nakamoto. The Sony subsidiary has reported a doubling of pre-tax profits, on sales up 6 per cent in the first half of the fiscal year. This was despite the stagnant market for audio-visual products in Japan and the adverse impact of a high yen. Sales were up 6 per cent to Y81.73bn (Dollars 757m) while pre-tax profits were more than double at Y2.3bn from Y1.15bn a year ago. The company's mini mini component stereos were an important contributor to its improved profits. In the US, overall sales were up by 60 per cent on a yen basis despite a 12 per cent increase in the yen's value, largely on the strength of the mini mini component stereo.</p>

			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Try Group sharply lower at Pounds 68,000 Profits of Try Group, the contractor and housebuilder, fell from Pounds 380,000 to Pounds 68,000 pre-tax for the half year ended June 30. Turnover was little changed at Pounds 62m compared with a previous Pounds 63m. The directors said the early months of the year brought some improvement in the rate of housing sales. However, this was not maintained and, despite a revival in the past few weeks, 'prices are not yet at a level at which we can generate profits'. Earnings fell to 0.08p (0.71p) but the interim dividend is being maintained at 0.5p. At period-end, net borrowings were down from Pounds 4.9m to Pounds 2m.</p>

			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / The price of the boss's options: US executives face growing pressure on their pay-packets April is proving to be an ambiguous month for top-earning executives in the US. First, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) proposed hard-hitting measures which would make companies report the value of share options granted to employees and subtract them from profits. Then  - only days later - the Clinton administration, which has been threatening strict new rules to limit the tax deductibility of seven-figure executive pay, softened its stance. Discontent over the remuneration levels enjoyed by top US executives has been rumbling for years. It has, however, been exacerbated by recession. When companies are losing money and employees are losing jobs, the sight of executives netting millions has become distasteful to investors, workers and politicians alike. For example, in 1991, Chrysler's Mr Lee Iaccoca earned nearly Dollars 3m (Pounds 1.9m) when the car company lost Dollars 795m. Share options - rights to buy a certain number of shares at a pre-determined 'exercise' price - have been a favourite way for US companies to increase employee incentive without discernibly hurting profits. Employees involved in such schemes have a reason to work for a higher share price; while the company is not obliged to pay out cash, merely to distribute shares. This will eventually dilute earnings per share, but usually by a modest amount. The popularity of such arrangements was demonstrated in a recent survey of 500 start-up companies by VentureOne, a San Francisco-based research company. About 97 per cent of the companies questioned had some form of share option scheme. For top executives these arrangements have become hugely lucrative. Last year, Primerica's Mr Sanford Weill was granted new options on 3.65m shares, at an average exercise price of Dollars 27 a share. The subsequent sharp rise in Primerica's stock means that he is already showing a paper profit of more than Dollars 70m although all the options cannot be exercised at this stage. Nor can share options always be justified as a long-term management incentive. In the pharmaceuticals sector, Merck's Mr Roy Vagelos was granted options on shares worth Dollars 25.6m at last year's exercise price. Mr Vagelos will retire at the end of 1994. Because stock options do not involve a cash outlay, they are not listed among a company's expenses. However, when em-ployees cash in their options at a profit, companies are allowed to deduct this surplus from their income for tax purposes. What FASB is proposing is a three-year interim period, during which companies must come to grips with techniques for estimating 'fair value' of employee options and prepare for the new accounting requirement. From 1997 however, options will be recognised as expenses on the day they are granted and charged against profits - although the expense would be stretched over the vesting period for the options. Quite how the 'fair value' of the options would be calculated is debatable. 'It's not all that complicated for companies to do,' said the board. 'All we've stated is that companies should use an option-pricing model, like the Black-Scholes model. These models are used now by option traders and others, and take into account interest rates, stock price today and volatility to produce a value for the options.' Corporate America, which had hoped the board would limit its interference to more stringent disclosure standards without a charge against profits, has so far been muted in its criticism. But the board can expect a chorus of corporate disapproval during a six-month comment period which will follow publication in June of its formal exposure draft. Ironically, the board's attempt to introduce flexibility for companies may trigger the loudest denunciation. It seems unlikely that the FASB will hold companies to any specific pricing model, and there have already been complaints about the confusion this will create. There is also no consensus on the degree to which the plans would deplete reported profits. Estimates range from as little as 2 per cent to as much as 10 per cent. It is certain that that some companies will change the way they reward employees. Critics of the plan argue that it will hit smaller and newer companies hardest, and that middle management will suffer more than top management if companies cut back on stock options. The VentureOne survey gives weight to some of these charges. While only 10 per cent of respondents said they would eliminate options altogether, 88 per cent they would reduce the number of employees receiving options. Furthermore, nearly half said options would be offered to key executives only. Some bigger companies, such as Merck and Pepsi, say they hope to retain their stock option programmes. Just as US corporations were starting to grapple with the board's proposals, however, they were offered some consolation by the US Treasury. Earlier this year the Clinton administration had suggested that companies should only be able to deduct salaries in excess of Dollars 1m when calculating taxable profits, if the pay was linked to the company's performance. More detailed proposals put forward by the Treasury suggest that performance-linked pay would include not only commissions or other earnings based directly on an executive's percentage of sales, but also any compensation package based on performance standards approved by the company's shareholders. The ban on deductibility would affect only the chief executive and the four other highest paid executives in a company. Compensation plans already in place before the measure was outlined on February 17 would be exempt. Some senior Wall Street executives welcomed the more relaxed stance on deductibility of large pay awards. One expressed his relief: 'Wall Street firms do spend a lot of money on people, so broad notions of a cap on the deductibility of compensation above Dollars 1m would have used tax policy in a way that discouraged businesses which invest in human capital instead of plant and equipment. However, the present approach is much more in line with traditional tax policy . . . and the new proposals deal with the issue in a relatively rational way.'

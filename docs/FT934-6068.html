			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Observer: Insuring your privacy Should you receive an approach from Royal Bank of Scotland to buy your business, and you value your privacy, take the money in equity rather than yearly bonuses. This seems the moral of the story of Peter Wood and the Moffat family. For the Moffats sold the A T Mays travel agents to Royal Bank around the time it was buying Wood's 25 per cent stake in Direct Line. Since then, Wood's ballooning compensation package has barely left the headlines. The bank finally paid Pounds 24m to buy out Wood's bonus in an effort to protect itself from the fuss. He now holds Pounds 10m in Royal Bank shares, less than a third of the 1.5 per cent the Moffats have held all along in glorious obscurity.</p>

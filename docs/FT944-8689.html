			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / UK Company News: 600 Group back with Pounds 2.47m New products and improved market conditions - especially in North America - helped 600 Group return to the black in the year to September 30, with pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.47m, against a Pounds 1.6m loss previously. But the machine tools and mechanical handling group said it was determined to maintain a cautious dividend policy 'for the time being,' and the interim payout is held at 0.5p. Turnover rose 23 per cent to Pounds 55.3m (Pounds 44.9m), and the pre-tax profits include a credit of Pounds 1.4m (Pounds 1.3m) related to the actuarial valuation of the UK pension scheme. The underlying improvement in operating profit is Pounds 4m. Prof Michael Wright, chairman, said the strategy of focused market and product development, combined with managed reductions in the operating cost base, was paying off. The decision to target the North American market, supported by the acquisitions of Lakeshore Machine Tools, KTS Industries and, more recently, United Machinery Sales of Indianapolis, had proved propitious. US sales rose 40 per cent on the comparable period. New products, especially the Tornado CNC lathe and the Scriba laser marker, had been received favourably and further products were in the pipeline. The two main divisions both achieved substantial turnrounds. On turnover of Pounds 35.8m (Pounds 28m) machine tools had pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.3m (Pounds 613,000 loss). Mechanical handling moved from a Pounds 540,000 loss to a Pounds 560,000 profit, on turnover of Pounds 13.7m (Pounds 12.3m). The company's cautious approach to the dividend is partly explained by the outlook. Although Prof Wright expected further improvements in group performance, he said European markets remained sluggish. The UK was experiencing a slow improvement as economic confidence increased, but the German market remained depressed. No big improvement in European conditions was expected before the middle of next year. Earnings per share were 3.8p (3.8p losses).</p>

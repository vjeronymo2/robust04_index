			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / Letter: When memory is altered Sir, I refer to Alan Cane's excellent and well-balanced article on the subject of 'altered' IBM memory (Technology, July 10). The fact that altered memory has been supplied to end users by leasing and broking companies, sometimes knowingly, mostly unknowingly, cannot be denied. Neither can it be denied that some of this memory has been altered using incorrect components and/or to an unacceptable standard of workmanship. These practices have already been condemned by all responsible members of the leasing and broking community, which wish to supply only equipment - whether altered or not - which is acceptable both to IBM and to the end user. To this end, it would be helpful if IBM would tell us whether or not IBM itself alters or reconfigures or creates 'new' IBM memory which it then incorporates into its 'new' machines out of used chips and memory cards in exactly the same way as the companies it is now suing.

			<p><P> September 14, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: LOS ALAMITOS;  </P> <P> TIMETABLE FOR SCHOOL CROSSING SIGNAL ASKED  </P> <P> Worried about the safety of students crossing the street in front of Los  Alamitos High School, the City Council has asked the city staff for a timetable  on installing a traffic signal.  </P> <P> The council stopped short of approving money for the Cerritos Avenue project,  deciding a better time to do so would be in January, when the item could be  added to the midyear budget.  </P> <P> A painted crosswalk in front of the school was removed in the spring after a  student was struck by a car while using the crosswalk. The student was not  seriously hurt.  </P> <P> The council decided the painted crosswalk was not always visible to motorists  and gave students a "false sense of security" in crossing the street.  </P> <P> Signs have been posted instead, warning students not to jaywalk, said Mike  Brotemarkle, city community development director. Students must now cross at  Humbolt Street or Los Alamitos Boulevard.  </P> <P> There is still some debate as to what sort of crossing will be used, but "that  one design aspect" could be determined at a later date, Councilman Ronald Bates  said at the council meeting this week.  </P></p>

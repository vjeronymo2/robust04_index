			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / International Company News: Canadian Pacific returns to the black with special gains boost CANADIAN Pacific, the transport, resource and property group, returned to profitability in the first quarter with the help of special gains. But Mr William Stinson, chairman, told the annual meeting the results were 'disappointing,' despite two years of radical restructuring of the company. 'However, the improvement in our share price to around CDollars 21 from a 52-week low of CDollars 13 1/2 reflects the group's future potential. I am very optimistic as we come out of the long recession,' he said He added that CP was improving its competitive position in all subsidiaries. The company had a good cash position, although consolid-ated debt was still too high. Improving operating results through the year, increasing cash-flow and the impact of the sale of non-core assets would strengthen the balance sheet significantly. Final first-quarter profit was CDollars 21.7m (USDollars 17.1m), or 7 cents a share, against a loss of CDollars 39.7m, or 12 cents, a year earlier. Total revenues were CDollars 1.9bn, down from CDollars 2.4bn, reflecting de-consolidation of interests in Unitel, the telecommunications group, and in United Dominion, its industrial products associate. Transportation, including the railway, contributed lower income, but 87 per cent owned PanCanadian, the oil and gas arm, reported operating income double that of the 1992 period. Property and hotels gained slightly and forest products narrowed losses. On an operating basis, Canadian Pacific reported overall income of CDollars 94.1m, against CDollars 61.4m. Mr Stinson said lower coal, wheat, sulphur and car traffic more than offset gains in potash, wood products and steel as well as inter-modal traffic. Ships made a positive contribution while the truck side reduced losses. 'We expect overall operating performance to improve gradually throughout 1993,' Mr Stinson said.</p>

			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Reynolds wants summit plan for an end to Ulster violence Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, yesterday set the creation of a joint UK-Irish framework for a permanent end to violence in Northern Ireland as the priority of his forthcoming summit with Mr John Major. His emphasis on securing an end to terrorism came as Mr James Molyneaux, the Ulster Unionist party leader, said it was possible that there could be 'significant developments over the weekend with regard to the terrorist situation'. He offered little explanation, but told his party executive in Belfast that more detailed information would be available early next week. As Mr Reynolds stepped up his campaign to reassure unionists in Northern Ireland of their veto over constitutional change, an opinion poll showed a majority of people in the Irish republic would support dropping their country's constitutional claim on the province. The poll, reported in the Irish Times, found that 51 per cent of those surveyed would agree to replace the claim with an aspiration, with 28 per cent against. Meanwhile, the UK government continued to hesitate over the timing of the summit, although Irish officials appeared confident that it would go ahead on Friday. There were also signs of important differences in the approach of the two governments to the summit. Mr Reynolds, who sent draft proposals to Mr Major on a possible framework for peace, wants the summit to concentrate on providing the background against which the IRA might declare an end to violence. That would involve a post-summit statement by the two leaders combining pledges to unionists on the constitutional integrity of the province with recognition of the legitimacy of the nationalist aspirations of the Catholic minority. It would also imply a further offer to Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, of an eventual place at the negotiating table in return for an end to violence. But Mr Reynolds' focus on the short-term possibilities for a halt to the IRA's military campaign conflicts with the much greater emphasis being placed by Mr Major on the need for a comprehensive political settlement. The UK prime minister has indicated that he is taking seriously the possibility that Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader, might be serious about ending the violence. However, amid growing alarm among moderate unionists about the direction of negotiations with Dublin, Mr Major wants the summit to provide the springboard for all-party talks on a political settlement. Mr Reynolds believes that should take second place to the peace process. Peace deadline, Page 7</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Pentti Suominen: "EU Farm Package Will Take </F> Billions From Taxpayers' Pocketbooks"]    [Text] Permanent subsidies will continue to be high even  after the transition phase. The drop in farm product prices will  probably be a small one in retail sales.    If a farmer feeds a pig throughout the fall with fodder  bought at Finnish prices, it will not pay for him to sell the  animal in January at European prices.    If a meat packer buys a pig in December at Finnish prices,  he  will not want to sell the ham made from it to a retail dealer at  European prices at the start of the year.    Hogs, the feed they eat, and cured pork products are only  some of the farm sector adjustment problems that have to be  resolved before Finland -- with increasingly greater likelihood  now -- becomes a full-fledged member of the European Union (EU)  at the start of next year.    To resolve these problems, the government and officials are  putting together a subsidy package that will pay out billions of  [Finnish] markkas [FMk], the cost of which both the EU and above  all Finnish taxpayers will share in.    The first draft of the package, produced largely by the  officials, was made public during the week that is now ending  and immediately gave rise to heated discussion. The big stir  over it is only expected to get worse before the government  approves it by 26 May at the latest, according to what Prime  Minister Esko Aho promises.    According to the broadest-based estimates, during Finland's  first year as a member of the EU, 1995, subsidies to be  disbursed out of domestic tax revenue would come to over FMk17  billion. The lowest estimates result in totals of well over  FMk10 billion.  <H5>  6,800 Markkas per Taxpayer </H5>   If the figure comes to 17 billion, each of Finland's over  2.5  million national income taxpayers would have to pay FMk6,800  next year to support the farm sector. If the figure were 12  billion, the cost incurred by each taxpayer would be FMk4,800.    This would mean that the cost of maintaining our farm sector  would account for from about 13 to 19 percent of what the  average wage earner pays in taxes. According to the most recent  statistics -- for 1992 -- compiled by the Taxpayers Association,  taxes came to FMk36,575 per wage earner.    The problems attributable to the transition period alluded  to  above in the example of the pig will increase the size of the  subsidy package next year. In addition to the farm sector per  se, the food industry will also come in for its share of the  transition period subsidies.    According to reports that have been published, subsidies to  be received by the food industry during the transition period  would come to nearly FMk2.7-3 billion and most of that, 2.2  billion, would be to compensate the industry for the drop in  value of its stocks.    Subsidies designed to compensate the farm sector proper for  additional costs during the transition period would, according  to reports that have appeared in the press, amount to from over  FMk3 billion to nearly FMk4 billion.    The EU is expected to contribute only somewhat more than  FMk100 million to the subsidies that go to the food industry,  but it is supposed to disburse over FMk1.5 billion in subsidies  to the farm sector.    The reports published on transition period subsidies,  considered by wage earners to be large ones, immediately gave  rise to criticism.    From the standpoint of the end result, how the subsidies  evolve over the long term is perhaps more important.    In connection with the decision on the EU, there was a great  deal of talk about structural changes in the farm sector and  about how the subsidies, which are viewed as being too high,  could be reduced as the farm population decreases. The reports  on the subsidy package that have been published are producing  disappointment.  <H5>  Permanent Farm Subsidies Would Continue To Be High </H5>   Permanent subsidies would also continue to be high. The  Finnish taxpayer's share of their cost would in future be about  FMk5.8 billion, whereas it is currently about FMk0.4 billion  less than that.    The EU's share of the permanent subsdidies totaling about  FMk9.3 billion would be 3.5 billion at the most. The purpose of  the subsidies is to help plug the FMk9.5 billion gap in farm  income there will be when producer prices fall to European  levels at the start of next year.    The goal is to cover the remaining shortfall of nearly FMk6  billion little by little over the years with the aid of cost  reductions, changes in the competition situation, structural  development, and apparently also tax breaks.    There is no change in the offing as concerns the possibility  that revenue from Finnish taxpayers would in future pay for  farmer pensions amounting to a couple of billion markkas a year,  the FMk1.1 billion cost of providing vacation substitutes for  farmers, and FMk0.9 billion for administrative, advisory,  research, and other expenses.    On the other hand, the tax system may be changed such that  farmers would not have to pay any taxes at all over the next few  years. Some people think that this is what will happen if the  government approves a reorganization program whereby farmers  could deduct half of their debts over FMk300,000 from their  taxable income during the next five years.    This would also mean subsidies involving billions since,  according to the Taxpayers Association, the farm economy paid a  total of nearly FMk3.3 billion in taxes in 1992, even though the  tax paid by an individual farmer was less than 20,000.    The FMk9.5 billion drop in producer prices will mean a drop  of nearly 40 percent in income composed of farm sales prices and  subsidies, which amounts to FMk25 billion when production costs  and taxes have not been deducted from it.    Farm product prices would not, however, drop as much as that  in retail sales. It is estimated that the real drop in prices  will only amount to less than 10 percent. Dairy product prices,  for example, are expected to rise.    The reasons for the slight drop in prices are trade and the  tax assessor.    Food sales amount to from FMk60 to 70 billion a year and the  imminent drop in producer prices will account for only 12-15  percent of that. If nothing else changes, the drop in prices  could be that great too.    However, the government is planning to replace the current  16-percent sales tax with Europe's higher 22-percent value-added  tax.</p>

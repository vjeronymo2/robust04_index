			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] At today's session of the Bosnia-Herzegovina  Presidency, chaired by President Alija Izetbegovic, support was  extended to the activities of the UN Protection Forces  [UNPROFOR] in the implementation of the 10 February NATO  declaration referring to the removal of heavy weapons to a  distance of 20 km from Sarajevo and the placement of these arms  under UNPROFOR control.    In connection with this, the Presidency accepted a total  cease-fire and freezing the positions of all the front lines in  the Sarajevo region. The Bosnia-Herzegovina Army will observe  this decision in full, the Presidency concluded.    The Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency upholds UNPROFOR's  proposal  to collect up all those weapons that remain within the 20-km  radius of Sarajevo and deposit them in a part of Sarajevo  airport temporarily controlled by UNPROFOR.    At today's session the Presidency voiced concern over the  positioning of UNPROFOR troops next to the Serbian positions  around Sarajevo. The Presidency fears that UNPROFOR troops  positioned in such a way could in several localities serve as a  shield for the Serbian positions in case of a NATO air attack.  There is a realistic danger that in the case of NATO air  strikes the Serbian aggressor would not permit UNPROFOR units to  abandon these positions, and so UNPROFOR soldiers could find  themselves as hostages.    Within the framework of these activities, particularly  worrying are the statements by some lower UNPROFOR commanders,  who are in various ways and, in the opinion of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency members, wrongly interpreting the  NATO declaration.    The current positioning of UNPROFOR troops in [the Serb  occupied Sarajevo suburb of] Grbavica is acceptable only in  order to supervise the cease-fire and can have no political  connotations, it was concluded at today's session of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency.</p>

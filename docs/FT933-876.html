			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / Management: Checking out the front line - Sir Alistair Grant, chairman of Argyll, suggests ways of staying close to staff and customers / Tips from the top Napoleon is popularly credited with responsibility for introducing the metric system, but the truth is that he tried to suppress it. He wrote of its proposed introduction: 'Nothing is more contrary to the organisation of the mind, of memory and of the imagination.' Presumably he thought he was in touch with the wishes of the common people; in fact, he was surrounded by advisers, lobbyists and eminent men and women cut off from direct contact with everyday life. We all run the risk of becoming petty Napoleons, and none of us has Napoleon's compensating genius. How can we continue to take the pulse of our business when we become directors or general managers excluded from direct contact with front-line staff or with our customers? We can side-step the problem in two ways: we can rely on market research or, more pompously, we can suggest that we are responsible for the direction of the business - strategy, policy, the provision of key resources - rather than its detailed management. During the past five years I have introduced a number of practices into Argyll in an attempt to ensure that directors stay close to the market, and also to encourage more people throughout the company to think about the whole business, not just their particular product or store or department. Our first initiative was the Young Managers' Forum. We selected 24 men and women from every part of the company - operations, trading, marketing, finance, distribution, personnel - and split them, more or less randomly, into four sub-groups. Each group selected a mentor from the Safeway board and chose a project which they would tackle together over a 12-month period. One group elected to deal with 'stress and tension among customers and staff at the supermarket checkout'. By the time they were through they had re-designed the checkout, eliminated the wires, metal pipes and flashing lights, introducing a pleasant green colour, creating more space and introducing a back-to-back module which enabled each checkout operator to see the face of his or her opposite number at the next checkout instead of having to stare at the back of a head. Other groups have looked at projects such as fruit merchandising to avoid spoilage, at ways of getting to know more about specific customers in each store, at opportunities for selling to offices and work places - all with positive results. Last year I asked each director three questions. Had he ever managed a store? When did he last manage a store? What was the size of the largest store he had managed? The results were fairly predictable. Only around a quarter of us had store management experience, none of us had managed a store within the past 20 years, the biggest store any of us had managed was less than half the size of our current average new store. I invited each director to adopt a store for a year. The brief was to get to know the store, its customers and its competitors; to assist the store manager to improve his operations; to become the colleague of management and staff; and to contribute to Safeway's competence in store operations by improving our understanding of how 'head office' decisions affect life at store level. My own adopted store is in a Midland town and competes with two discount operators. Sometimes I spend half a day there acting not as a supernumerary district manager but as a colleague of the store manager. I can take an interest in any aspect of the store, I can spend a morning talking to customers, I can assess our specific local strengths and weaknesses against the competition. What am I learning? There is too much to recount, but it includes noting that it takes us too long to make a cup of cappuccino in our cafe, that we need to improve our in-store pizza operations, that customer problems in a dry cleaning department can be tough problems for staff to deal with and a host of other observations that are helpful to me and to the whole business. The man who said 'Retail is Detail' was only partly right but he was (partly) very right. Next Monday: Christopher Haskins of Northern Foods on how to handle the press.</p>

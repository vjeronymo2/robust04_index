			<p><P> March 27, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DOZENS SIGN PETITIONS OPPOSING ADMINISTRATION ROLE IN MISSOURI CASE;  </P> <P> JUSTICE DEPT. LAWYERS PROTEST ABORTION STANCE  </P> <P> The Justice Department is facing an internal protest over the Bush  Administration's aggressive effort to persuade the Supreme Court to reverse its  rulings legalizing abortion, according to department sources.  </P> <P> Several dozen attorneys have signed petitions circulating within the department  in the last week criticizing the Administration's attempt to turn a relatively  narrow abortion appeal from Missouri into an all-out attack on the high court's  1973 Roe vs. Wade ruling.  </P> <P> Last month, the department blamed the court's once-solid pro-choice majority  for "the deep divisions in American society" over the abortion issue. Its brief  called the Roe decision "flawed" and "unworkable" and urged that it be  overturned.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Court Grants Request  </P> <P> Last week, the Supreme Court granted the department's request to have its  solicitor general participate in the April 26 oral argument in the Missouri  case to press for the reversal of the Roe decision.  </P> <P> At least 50 government lawyers have signed protest petitions, and more  signatures will be sought this week, said one government source. "We believe  that every woman has the right to make her own decision about whether or not to  continue her pregnancy," the petition states.  </P> <P> Some of the protesting attorneys also say it is unseemly for top department  lawyers to essentially ignore the issues presented by the Missouri case in  order to seek a more sweeping ruling on abortion.  </P> <P> The Missouri law in question forbids the use of public funds or public  employees for "encouraging" or "assisting" abortions. An appellate court struck  down the law last year as an unconstitutional attempt to infringe on a woman's  right to an abortion.  </P> <P> But even if the justices were to reverse a lower court ruling and reinstate the  law, they need not tamper with the underlying Roe doctrine giving a woman the  right to choose abortion. More than 95% of the abortions in Missouri take place  in private clinics and are unaffected by the state law, according to lawyers on  both sides of the case.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Shrugs Shoulders  </P> <P> David Runkel, Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh's chief spokesman, said the attorney  general is aware of the protest and has reacted "with a shrug of his  shoulders."  </P> <P> Thornburgh "recognizes that everybody has their right to free speech. He  understands this is a particularly divisive issue, and that there are a lot of  strong views on this," Runkel said. "If they are seeking a change in the  (government's) position on this, that's not going to happen," he added.  </P> <P> During the presidential campaign, President Bush said repeatedly he opposed  abortion. And Thornburgh, who was first appointed by former President Ronald  Reagan and retained by Bush, has been known as a strong foe of the Roe ruling  since his days as governor of Pennsylvania.  </P> <P> As soon as Missouri Atty. Gen. William L. Webster decided to challenge the  appellate court decision, U.S. Justice Department officials sought to raise the  stakes. Outgoing U.S. Assistant Atty. Gen. William Bradford Reynolds contacted  Webster last fall and persuaded him to add a line to his initial appeal to the  high court suggesting the case could be used as a basis to "reconsider" the Roe  ruling.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Officially Urge Appeal  </P> <P> Two days after Bush was elected, the Justice Department announced it would  officially urge the court to hear the Missouri appeal. That was followed by the  Feb. 23 brief urging that the Missouri case be used as the basis for entirely  overruling the Roe decision.  </P> <P> Even without the Justice Department's active involvement, the Missouri appeal  (Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services, 88-605) would have drawn intense  interest because of the high court's changed makeup. In 1986, when the Roe  doctrine was last affirmed, it came on a 5-4 vote. Since then, one pro-choice  member, Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr., retired and was replaced by Reagan's third  appointee, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy.  </P> <P> The switch created speculation that the court was at least ready to alter its  firm pro-choice stand, and possibly, overturn the Roe ruling.  </P></p>

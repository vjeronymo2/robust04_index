			<p><P> February 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: DUARTE;  </P> <P> BINGO AT SCHOOL REJECTED  </P> <P> For the second time, the school board last week rejected a request to use a  school facility to play bingo.  </P> <P> The board had agreed to review its summer decision after the Duarte Citizens  Bingo Committee last month presented trustees with its survey that showed eight  San Gabriel Valley schools profited from sponsoring bingo.  </P> <P> The Duarte Community and Education Foundation, which raises funds for the  school district, had been sponsoring weekly games at the City of Hope National  Medical Center until the October, 1987, earthquake damaged the hall it was  using.  </P> <P> Supt. Bob Packer said the board denied the foundation use of a school cafeteria  for the activity because of concerns about gambling on school grounds and the  school's liability for the players.  </P></p>

			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / World Trade News: Ford, Mazda may produce European car Ford and Mazda, the US and Japanese carmakers, are to begin negotiations shortly which could lead to the produc tion of cars at a Ford plant in Europe for sale under the Mazda badge in European mar kets. The cars, modified versions of Ford products, could be built at one of Ford's two plants in the UK, where it has significant excess capacity. Mr Wayne Booker, Ford executive vice-president, international operations, said European production for Mazda would be one of the priority issues to be examined, as a result of the closer strategic relationship being developed between the two groups. Ford acquired a 25 per cent stake in Mazda in 1979 and the two groups already have extensive links. Two weeks ago, with Mazda in loss and under growing financial pressure, they announced these ties were to be strengthened with closer co-operation mainly in product planning and manufacturing. The number of Ford-nominated directors of Mazda is being increased from four to seven; four of these directors are to be appointed to management positions including one as executive vice-president. 'One of the issues is how we help Mazda in Europe,' said Mr Booker in an interview with the Financial Times. 'The degree of openness that should now be established will allow a different way of evaluating the use of more Ford products.' Earlier talks between Mazda and Ford about European production for the Japanese carmaker broke down in March last year after nearly four years' fruitless talks. Mazda had previously held abortive talks with Saab of Sweden. The change in Ford's attitude towards collaborating with Mazda in Europe stems from its high level of overcapacity in Europe, where it has been in heavy losses for the past three years. Mr Booker said Ford now had more spare capacity than envisaged 18 months ago, because of the steep decline in new car demand in west Europe and gains made by its own drive to increase productivity. The choice of Ford plant at which cars would be produced for Mazda would depend on which product was selected. 'It looks right now as if it would be Halewood or Dagenham (Ford's two UK car assembly plants) rather than Saarlouis (one of Ford's two German assembly plants).'</p>

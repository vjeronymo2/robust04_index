			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Alan Fine and Tim Cohen] </F>   [Text] With the inauguration of SA's [South Africa] new  President less than four weeks away, speculation -- often  dressed up as fact -- is mounting on the shape of the new  Cabinet Nelson Mandela is likely to appoint. The speculation is  as intense within the ANC as without.    As far as is known, final decisions have not yet been made  despite reports to the contrary. But the considerations at  stake are becoming clearer -- particularly in the key posts of  Deputy President, Finance Minister, Reconstruction and  Development and the security portfolios. It is not yet decided  whether the Reconstruction and Development post will be a  separate Cabinet position or be placed within the President's  department. Either way, it is obviously the surefire bet --  former COSATU [Congress of South African Trade Unions] general  secretary Jay Naidoo is unchallenged.    Constructing the new Cabinet is likely to be one of  Mandela's  loneliest tasks. Devising the candidates' lists was much easier  -- it having been a product of the popular will combined with  tinkering by the national executive and special interest  lobbying by the likes of COSATU, SANCO [South African National  Civics Organisation] and the SACP [South African Communist  Party]. Where the Cabinet is concerned, Mandela will (and  presumably has already been) pondering these issues with only  limited reference to many of his most senior colleagues since  they have a direct personal interest in the outcome.    Some insiders suggest that, to the extent that he consults  initially, he will do so informally with his closest friends --  mainly his old fellow inmates on Robben Island and primarily  Walter Sisulu who probably has no Cabinet ambitions of his own.  Eventually he will have to go to his National Executive  Committee, but that organ will be hard pressed to make objective  decisions.    The Deputy President post is a curious one. Some observers  see it as a straight contest between Cyril Ramaphosa and Thabo  Mbeki -- two of the contenders (likely PWV  [Pretoria-Witwatersrand-Vereeniging] premier Tokyo Sexwale being  the third) for Mandela's position when he retires. But it is  questionable whether the post is a significant one beyond that,  especially given that F.W. de Klerk will also probably be a  Deputy President. Unless, of course, the Deputy President is  also able to hold a senior Cabinet post.    Which brings us around to the most crucial post -- that of  Finance Minister. Will it be Derek Keys, and if not, then who?  First, there is no undertaking in the TEC's [Transitional  Executive Council] statement of policy to the IMF that Keys and  Reserve Bank Governor Chris Stals have been guaranteed their  posts in the government of national unity (as was suggested  yesterday by BEELD).    However, there is broad agreement in the ANC that Stals  should be reappointed when his present term expires in June.  The issue, quite simply, is investor and business confidence.  (There is some concern in parts of the ANC, though, at talk  that the deputy governorship may go to Bank of Beijing-trained  radical economist Vella Pillay, which would not enhance  confidence.) But it does go further, as reflected by a question  put this week by a senior ANC source: "Do we need to keep both  Keys and Stals in place to maintain confidence, or is Stals  enough?"    There is genuine ANC concern about giving the key Finance  portfolio to an NP [National Party] member -- many would not  stand for it. While the incumbent may have to ensure financial  discipline, he should at least be committed in principle to the  RDP [Reconstruction and Development program], it is argued.  Even a senior NP source argued cogently this week that the post  should be held by the ANC. Keys, the argument goes, was able to  maintain financial discipline because he had the unstinting  support of De Klerk. Given the populist pressures the ANC will  face, the new Finance Minister should be someone with a  political base sufficiently sound to empower him (or her) to say  "no" to excessive claims on the Treasury by his colleagues.    The question is -- who fits this bill? It is widely accepted  that neither of the ANC's top two economics department figures  -- Trevor Manuel and Tito Mboweni -- have the stature in terms  of experience or political popularity. The two most likely  candidates, therefore, are Mbeki (tipped by the SUNDAY TIMES  some weeks ago) or Ramaphosa. Both have the necessary political  base, and some, though limited, economic and financial  expertise. But they would be surrounded by the bright young  officials who have advised ANC policymakers in the past four  years, and many of the incumbent Finance Ministry bureaucrats  trained latterly by Keys.    There are many other economics-linked posts which could be  occupied by Keys, Manuel, Mboweni and others -- such as Trade  and Industry, Public Enterprises, Mineral and Energy Affairs,  Agriculture, Transport, Manpower, Water and Forestry and so on.    This raises an international fact of life of  cabinet-building. As a Centre for Policy Studies analyst points  out, many appointments are made on the basis of political  favours owed rather than expertise in a portfolio or other  special qualities. There is no reason to think the ANC will be  any different. The key to avoiding chaos is to ensure that  senior departmental officials are capable. They then need only  "to give the Minister a few papers to sign each day" and to  focus their energies on running the show.    Mandela's position is made all the more difficult because  many of the top ANC candidates have no obvious administrative  skills in vital areas of government. Although Mbeki would be an  obvious candidate for Foreign Minister if he does not get  Finance -- and even if he makes Deputy President -- and Steve  Tshwete must be a sitter for the sport portfolio, who in the ANC  knows anything about how to administer transport, water affairs,  the environment and even education or health?    When it comes to handing out rewards for favours, Mandela  will have some leeway by virtue of the fact that he also has to  establish, in terms of the constitution, a public protector, a  human rights commission, and the restitution of land rights. In  his selection of Cabinet candidates, De Klerk is likely to be  swayed by the success of each region in the election. On this  criteria, and on the basis of seniority in the party, the most  likely candidates would therefore be Cape leader Dawie de  Villiers, Transvaal leaders Pik Botha and Roelf Meyer and  [Orange] Free State leader Kobie Coetsee along with Keys.    The portfolios Mandela may consider distributing to NP  candidates would be Agriculture to appease white farmers, and  Public Administration to quell the fears of the  Afrikaner-dominated public service. The DP's historical role as  parliamentary watchdog and its centrist position could well be  recognised by the appointment of party veteran Colin Eglin as  Speaker of Parliament.    The constitution provides for the appointment of a maximum  of  27 Cabinet Ministers, but it does not specify which portfolios  must be allocated to opposition members. Technically,  therefore, Mandela could make the four or so NP candidates  (assuming the NP gets 20 percent of the vote) "Ministers without  portfolio" but he is required to engage in a process of  non-binding consultation with other party leaders and make his  decisions "in the spirit underlying the concept of a government  of national unity."    Mandela is not constrained by the constitution on what  portfolios should be created. The ANC has already expressed its  desire to reintegrate the State Expenditure and Finance  departments. Other likely changes are a separation of the  Regional and Land Affairs portfolio in line with the increased  importance of regional government, and the creation of a Gender  Affairs Ministry. Whether Housing and Public Works should be  split is an open question and whether the current Public  Enterprises Department will keep its "and Privatisation" epithet  is a moot point.</p>

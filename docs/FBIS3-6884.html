			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Kenichi Ohmae, director of McKinsey &amp; Company </F> Inc.: "The Inventory of a Zero Fighter-Like Nation -- Japan"]    [Text] "No amount of negotiations will reach a favorable  conclusion when we are forced to deal with Japanese bureaucrats.  They will never abandon their vested rights unless they are hit  by an atomic bomb," an American trade negotiator said angrily  when I met with him recently.    I do not totally agree with him. However, the truth is that  what Japanese bureaucrats are doing now is similar to what their  predecessors, including the military authorities, were doing  toward the end of World War II when Japan's defeat was already  evident.    What did the military authorities do at that time? Until the  curtain came down, they did not admit that Japan had lost its  power. As a result, Japan continuously fought a bitter retreat,  and let itself in for the Imphal action. The Japanese  authorities were finally made aware of their defeat only after  the nation was hit by two atomic bombs. Moreover, they had the  audacity to use the expression "the end of the war" instead  "defeat in war."    Meanwhile, following the attack on Pearl Harbor, the United  States conducted what is referred to as operations research: It  conducted scientific research on warfare, using statistics and  the law of probability. The United States placed greater  emphasis on aircraft carriers, while the large guns of the  battleship remained the key weapon of the Japanese. In other  words, the United States learned many things while waging war.    Once again, Japanese bureaucrats have fallen into the same  logic as used during World War II. The current war between  Japan and the United States differs from the previous one only  in means. The two countries now use economic might instead of  armed force. Meanwhile, Japanese bureaucrats continue to take  exactly the same attitude their predecessors did 50 years ago.  Although the outcome of the war is already evident, they do not  want to admit it. The public also shows a similar attitude as  it did 50 years ago; people continue to watch the development of  events in silence. Major newspapers play up the information  released by the government, as they used to do with the official  announcements made by the Imperial Headquarters 50 years ago.    In December 1993, NEWSWEEK did a cover story on the end of  the Japanese system. It explained the collapse of Japan by  using the present perfect tense. It clearly said: "The system  has crashed." In November 1993, before the NEWSWEEK cover story  appeared, I also mentioned in my book The Ohmae  Report--Toward a Fundamental Restructuring of Japan  (published by Kodansha Ltd.) that the Japanese economic system  had crashed.    What are the factors that brought about the end of the  Japanese centralist system? One of the main factors is the  strong departmentalism of Japanese administrative agencies.    The defect of departmentalism is the nonexistence of a  responsible person capable of studying a question in its broader  aspects. For instance, the Ministry of Finance is composed of  several divisions such as the Budget Bureau, the Tax Bureau, the  Banking Bureau, the Securities Bureau, and the Financial Bureau.  Top-ranking officials feel the entire situation automatically  comes out correctly if every bureau works well. That is the  same mentality the General Staff had during the Greater East  Asia War. At that time, the General Staff could not help  adopting an optimistic view regarding the outcome of the war,  since every general reported the war was going in his favor on  his battle front.    The industrial world has the same problem: the nonexistence  of a business leader capable of looking at the main points.    For instance, let us study the auto industry. After years of  complicated negotiations, Japan and the United States agreed to  raise Japan's self-imposed export quota from 1.68 million to 2.3  million vehicles. In order to sell more cars, Japanese  automakers had to establish their manufacturing plants in the  United States, and now their U.S. subsidiaries are obliged to  procure 50 percent or more of a vehicle's parts in the United  States because, under U.S. local-content legislation, a locally  made car cannot be considered American if 50 percent of its  value does not come from parts and labor originating in the  United States.    A total of 125 manufacturers, including auto parts  manufacturers, have moved to the United States to produce 2  million vehicles.    Japanese manufacturers want to export 2.3 million cars from  Japan and manufacture 2 million more vehicles in the United  States. If that is the case, the U.S. market would be flooded  with 4.3 million Japanese cars. Since the U.S. market is  estimated at 10 million cars, it would mean more than 40 percent  of the market would be dominated by Japanese cars. "Politically  speaking, is such a situation acceptable?" Unfortunately, no  one considers the matter. When I asked this question to the top  executive of each auto manufacturer, each replied in the same  way. "I do not know what the other companies are doing, but  there is no problem with us because we are planning to sell only  1 million cars." Their attitude proves that in the auto  industry, no one can see the problem in perspective.    Japan Is Just Like a Zero Fighter ("Flying Fuel Tank")    In the first chapter of my book Borderless World  (published in English by Harper &amp; Row, and published in  Japanese  by President Inc.), I had already raised the question in  anticipation of the current situation. I said the glut of  Japanese cars in the U.S. market would become serious in the  near future. The United States feels Japan has two choices:  export 2.3 million cars from Japan, or produce 2 million cars in  the United States. It is not a question of exporting 2.3  million cars from Japan and producing 2 million more in the  United States simultaneously. Therefore, in my book I explained  that once Japanese plants begin to produce 2 million cars in the  United States, the U.S. Government might ban exports of those  2.3 million cars from Japan. I added that what is certain at  the very least is the U.S. Government will never accept over 4  million Japanese cars in the U.S. market.    U.S. automakers can now buy Japanese-made high-quality auto  parts at a low price; consequently, Japanese manufacturers have  lost their competitive superiority. Cars manufactured by U.S.  automakers in Detroit are cheaper than those made by Japanese  manufacturers. Detroit is now completely restored to its former  state, and is able to produce a car 30 percent cheaper than a  Japanese car of similar quality. Under the pressure of  necessity, Japanese automakers have abandoned the mass market to  place greater emphasis on luxury cars. The U.S. automobile  industry, which had been suffering severely in the recession as  if it had continuously been exposed to heavy rain, now enjoys  fine weather. Recently, Chrysler Corporation and Ford Motor  Company recorded their highest sales and profits.    The change in the situation reminds me of the Pacific war.  It may safely be said the Japan of today is the exact image of  a Zero fighter.    At the sacrifice of safety, the Zero fighter was designed to  be faster and more maneuverable and to carry more bombs. Thus,  when it was attacked by the enemy, its fuselage could be easily  pierced by bullets, proving fatal to the crew members. Japanese  cars of today are the exact incarnation of Zero fighters.    The Zero fighter was nicknamed the "Flying Fuel Tank"  because  of its thin armor plating. Not only the auto industry but all  of Japanese society can be symbolized as such.    Japan made many sacrifices to reach its ultimate goal of  building a national economy based on exports. Such being the  case, Japanese companies were able to defeat their competitors.  However, their victory was superficial and ephemeral, for it  was not long before they saw their infrastructure being  destroyed because of its fragility. Now they are confronted  with a disastrous situation. This is exactly what happened to  the Zero fighter during World War II.    Five years ago people frequently spoke about the collapse of  the U.S. manufacturing industry. At that time, U.S.  manufacturers were actually in the midst of restructuring. Five  years ago, the weakness of the U.S. manufacturing industry was  conspicuous, with many companies declaring bankruptcy or having  to lay off workers and close down. Thanks to fundamental  restructuring, once-strong companies have made a comeback,  becoming more powerful than ever. They have reduced their  working staffs by half thanks to reengineering (a total  rethinking of business processes and practices) and to a  substantial rationalization of indirect labor, which was  supported by the introduction of information technology systems.  The United States owes what it is today to these drastic  measures aimed at changing the management system.    Far from holding a 40-percent share in the auto U.S. market,  Japanese automakers are not even able to maintain a 25-percent  market share under the present state of affairs. They cannot  sell more than 2.3 million vehicles in total, inclusive of those  imported from Japan and manufactured locally. This sales volume  is equivalent to the self-imposed export quota (Japanese auto  exports to the United States have currently decreased to 1.65  million vehicles). Therefore, they want to shut down their U.S.  plants, which have a total capacity of 2 million vehicles.  However, they cannot take such a measure since their U.S.  plants went into operation only recently. Moreover, politically  speaking, the closing down of plants would considerably affect  the Japan-U.S. relationship. Japan-bashers would certainly  criticize Japan, saying: "Once again Japanese companies created  employment destabilization in the United States by shutting down  their plants."    The only solution left to them is to reduce their exports  from Japan. Unfortunately, no corporate executives are ready to  give up exports and tackle the employment issue at home. They  have a glib tongue; all they can do is stress the need for  originality and ingenuity, while their companies continue to  lose strength. Japanese companies are now heading toward a dead  end. Moment by moment, things are becoming serious, approaching  the day when Japan will be hit by another atomic bomb.    What has the Ministry of International Trade and Industry  been doing until now? All it has done is back up Japan's  overseas production. In other words, MITI did nothing other  than participate along with the United States in hastening the  death of Japanese companies by encouraging them to establish  their plants in the United States.    Another problem is that Japanese products are driven out of  the market because of foreign-made "Japanese products."    The parts manufacturing industry is equipment-intensive.  Therefore, without mass production, a parts manufacturer cannot  pay its way. Domestically, Japanese parts manufacturers have  been suffering from sluggish sales due to a prolonged recession.  They must export their products to Southeast Asia at low prices.  In the case of office automation and audiovisual products, both  of which are the forte of Japanese companies, the result was it  became possible to reduce costs by 30 percent by assembling  these products in Southeast Asia. Singapore, for instance, is  flooded with all kinds of Japanese-made parts. Some of them are  exported to the United States from there.    Domestically, Japanese manufacturers do not feel the need to  reduce prices. They continue to impose their expensive office  automation products, as well as their expensive audiovisual  products, on Japanese users. Under the circumstances, it is  quite normal that "Japanese-made Japanese products" cannot  compete with "Asian-made Japanese products" in the U.S. market.  Moreover, some of these "Asian-made Japanese products" are  reimported to Japan. There is no help for Japanese  manufacturers. What one has sown, one will have to reap.  Japanese companies have rapidly lost their competitive power in  this manner.    The transfer to Southeast Asia was not limited to the parts  manufacturing industry. Other manufacturers completely switched  to overseas production by establishing their production hub in  Southeast Asia or China, causing the so-called  deindustrialization of Japan. As a temporary measure to cope  with the situation, hard-hit companies are content to ask the  government for "employment adjustment subsidies" to retrain and  relocate their excess workers. In Japan, large companies cannot  easily dismiss their employees because, if they create  unemployment, they will be summoned by the Ministry of Labor and  be chastised for engaging in such an inadmissible act. This is  why an excellent company like Hitachi Ltd. applies for subsidies  when it finds itself with a large number of excess workers. In  1993, the total amount of such subsidies exceeded 100 billion  yen.    Steel products, automobiles, audiovisual products, and  semiconductors--all these industries were doing fine until five  years ago. Now most of them are unable to make profits in the  export market. With the current dollar-yen exchange rate at the  level of 110 yen to the dollar, no Japanese companies are able  to bring their export business out of the red. They will  probably not reach the break-even point as long as the dollar  remains below the 130 yen level.    The long and short of it is that Japanese companies are  merely pushing themselves into a tight corner. The logic is  simple, but unfortunately business leaders are unaware of it.  Or they might be conscious of it, but think they have gone too  far to retreat. None of them wants to announce a curtailment of  output because none of them is sure if other companies will  follow their example, so everyone says: "Our company will  continue to produce this much for the present term." In any  case, Japan is now at death's door, just as it was towards the  end of World War II.  <H5>  The Economic Stimulus Package Will Have No Impact </H5>   "What in the world is the government doing? What it must do  is urgently adopt a new economic stimulus package." Japanese  business executives repeat this sentence unceasingly. The  adoption of pump-priming measures will be charged to the  national treasury. That is to say, the government will have to  spend tax money collected from the public. This means that, by  demanding implementation of a new economic stimulus package,  Japanese business leaders are trying to saddle taxpayers with  their debts which are the result of their over-optimistic way of  doing business. As corporate managers, they should have many  other things to do before complaining to the government.  However, the fact is they are unable to wrestle with adverse  circumstances because everything went so smoothly for them for  many years. During the period when Reaganomics and Thatcherism  were in full swing, no U.S. or British corporate executives  asked their government for help. Rather, they did their best to  carry out restructuring for the survival of their companies. In  the United States and Great Britain, a timid executive would be  immediately ousted from the board meeting.    As for Japanese labor unions, they have neither the  competency nor moral energy to go on strike. Most have not gone  on strike during the past 35 years. They just continue to  accumulate union dues. It is not unusual for a Japanese labor  union to organize a one-day trip for all its members for a  karaoke party at a bath resort. However, no one goes on strike  to call management's responsibility into question. Rengo  [National Confederation of Trade Unions] is pleased it has come  into power [a parliamentary group composed of Rengo-affiliated  councilors is currently a coalition member]. However, the  coalition government did nothing but raise public utility  charges such as postal rates, the transaction tax on gas, oil,  subway fares, and tuition fees for public universities. Is this  in line with the doctrine advocated by Rengo that sovereignty  resides in the consumers?    Moreover, the ordinary postage of domestic mail is now 80  yen; it is cheaper to send a letter by air to Japan from the  United States or Australia. What is going on in Japan? With a  labor union in power, I expected a less objectionable situation.    As for management, it continues to marshal all sorts of  flowery words without taking any action. "No one will be  dismissed so long as I hold power." Corporate executives hold  such feelings because they have always set great value on  labor-capital harmonization. While Japanese corporate executives  remain idle, Japan's international competitiveness continues to  fade away.    To begin with, it is overly optimistic to think the  implementation of a new pump-priming package will somehow help  improve the economic situation. An economic stimulus package,  no matter how large, cannot pull the national economy out of  recession.  <H5>  The Wage Level Will Stabilize in the United States and China </H5>   Let us suppose the national economy recovered, or the dollar  again reached the 130 yen level. Even under such circumstances,  Japan will be unable to beat the United States, the reason being  the U.S. manufacturing industry has regained its competitive  power in the true sense of the term. Its recuperative power is  sustained by labor costs.    The average salary of an American worker has not increased  for 13 years, since the Reagan era. In fact, in the case of  white-collar workers, who account for 25 percent of the working  class, their wages have increased by 28 percent. As for the 25  percent at the bottom of the working class, their wages have  decreased by 10 percent. On average, the wage level has  remained almost unchanged for many years in the United States.    For instance, in Japan the average salary of a  Rengo-affiliated worker is about 7.2 million yen; meanwhile, in  the United States the average salary of a comparable worker is  about 4 million yen. This is a little less than 60 percent of  the Japanese worker's salary. The recovery of the U.S. industry  is supported by such competitive labor costs.    Moreover, in addition to labor costs, the impact of the  North  American Free Trade Agreement [NAFTA] should be also taken into  consideration.    NAFTA aims at transforming North America into one huge,  single market by 1999. In Canada, where the population totals  25 million, the salary of a white-collar worker is about 30  percent lower than that of a U.S. worker. Meanwhile, in Mexico,  where the population totals 80 million, the salary of a  blue-collar worker is one-eighth that of a U.S. worker's. What  does this mean for U.S. industry? It means U.S. companies might  move to Canada or Mexico for low-wage labor if U.S. workers  request higher wages.    In other words, U.S. business executives have obtained a new  option which is extremely favorable for them. NAFTA has this  important significance. In the United States, wage levels will  probably not increase over the next 10 years as they did during  the past 10.    Let us now turn our eyes to Japan. We see China is just  behind Japan. China has completely changed since March 1992.  Many say China is a nation with two systems. In my own  opinion, China completely follows the capitalist line, or the  mammonist line.    In China, the average salary of a blue-collar worker is no  more than 60,000 yen a year. Even for a work leader or a  foreman or a white-collar worker, the annual salary is about  90,000 yen. A Chinese worker at the Baoshan Iron &amp; Steel  Complex or Maanshan Iron and Steel Corporation makes no more  than 90,000 yen, while a Japanese worker employed by Nippon  Steel Corporation earns more than 10 million yen annually.  Although both workers make the same product--crude steel--the  labor cost is 100 times higher in Japan.    To me, the advent of a reborn China is the same as if 28 new  nations like Singapore were formed simultaneously. For  instance, when we look at Dalian or Tianjin, we realize there  are already many factories assembling such products as the main  memory unit for laptop computers, or factories manufacturing  cylinder heads for video recorders. In the past, even North  America could barely produce cylinder heads. In other words,  apart from a few high-tech products such as liquid crystal  displays, and apart from some capital- intensive industries,  almost everything can be manufactured in China, where it  requires only 1 percent of the Japanese labor cost. Moreover,  with a population of 1.2 billion, China has an unlimited supply  of labor.    The most important point is that, like in the United States,  wage levels will remain unchanged in China.    In South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore the labor market is  quite homogeneous. When the economy takes a favorable turn, the  labor market tightens rapidly, bringing about an increase in  wages. However, in China the labor market is very diversified.  For instance, if the wage is $12,000 in Hong Kong, it might be  $6,000 in the adjacent area of Shenzhen; in Guangzhou it might  be one-third of that in Shenzhen, while in Yunnan it might be  one-third of the amount in Guangzhou. More and more people work  for lower wages the farther you go inland. China has an  "unlimited storage reservoir of labor."    In other words, the colonialization of the inland areas by  the coastal areas is expected to continue, so the wages of  Chinese workers in labor-intensive industries will not increase  over the next 10 years.    Unfortunately, Japanese corporate managers are not  threatened  by the fact that wage levels will remain unchanged both in the  United States and China. Moreover, there is no risk of their  losing their position, unlike in the United States where there  was a time when corporate executives were toppled one after  another.    At the beginning of the year, when I attended New Year's  parties organized by major economic organizations in Tokyo and  Osaka, I got the impression that Japanese corporate executives  were still enjoying a period of peace and tranquillity; their  only concern was who will be the next chairman of Keidanren  [Japan Federation of Economic Organizations]? They quarreled  over this question. At a different gathering held to wish one  another a happy New Year, corporate executives all joined in  chanting against the government: "That's enough with political  reform! Hurry with the economic stimulus package!"    In this article I am trying to present several problems that  affect the basic competitive strength of Japanese industry.  These are not the kind of problems that can be settled easily  by initiating a new pump-priming program.    Let us suppose the national economy recovers due to the  effects of an economic stimulus package. If such were the case,  U.S. and Chinese products would immediately invade the Japanese  market. Japanese manufacturers, who have been deceiving Japanese  consumers by imposing expensive products on them, would suffer  from a sharp decrease in prices. Therefore, even if the economy  picks up, there is no possibility of them doubling their  business. The government is at its wit's end. It has already  implemented every imaginable macroeconomic measure: emergency  public investment worth 30 trillion yen, an all-time low  interest rate, and a continuous increase in the money supply.  Unfortunately, these measures have not induced people to spend  more money. Companies have received no new orders.    To stimulate the economy, Japanese business leaders are  calling for income tax reductions and fiscal investment. They  are merely trying to resort to an old method that worked 10  years ago. This method was correct when Japan's major  industries were improving their competitive power. Moreover, at  that time the United States had no intention of seriously  quarreling with Japan due to the Cold War. This was why the  United States did not launch an offensive to induce a sharp  appreciation of the yen against the dollar as it is doing now.  However, in the United States today there is a theory that when  the dollar is quoted at 100 yen, it will have the same effect as  dropping another atomic bomb on Japan. Quite a few people  seriously think continued appreciation of the yen against the  dollar would serve the best interests of Japan in the long run.    With respect to the yen-dollar exchange rate, I have already  written several times in this magazine that both the United  States and Japan are adopting a wrong view of the matter.  Trying to correct the trade imbalance by manipulating the  exchange rate is a gross error. It is clear the real intention  of the United States is to debilitate Japanese companies, and  particularly to weaken the competitive strength of Japan's  export-intensive industries.    Japanese bureaucrats are tolerating the high appreciation of  the yen against the dollar, saying it will help rectify the  trade imbalance, because they cannot grasp the main point. What  they have been doing in concert with the business world is  nothing less than wrecking Japan's export industry, the only  means for Japan to accumulate wealth. In the United States, a  certain Dr. Jack Kevorkian recently invented a suicide machine.  It is as if the Japanese Government had prepared a similar  device on its own initiative, and is now experimenting on  Japanese industry with it.    No Japanese industry can survive in a world where the dollar  is quoted at 100 yen. However, even if the dollar returns to  the 130 yen level, the problem will not be settled. Rather, the  competitive power of the United States would become more  conspicuous. It is no exaggeration to say the United States has  regained its competitiveness to that extent.  <H5>  The United States Is the Sole Winner of the Intelligence War </H5>   The other problem is that the large guns of the  battleship--namely automobiles and household electric  appliances--no longer serve as key weapons in the current war.  In the long run, the production of such products will be  completely transferred to low wage-labor areas such as Asia and  Mexico.    The 21st century will see the outbreak of an intelligence  war. In this war, white-collar workers in tertiary industries  will be the main soldiers. From now on, the wealth of a nation  will be built by these people. Lucrative fields or products  with brilliant prospects are multimedia, the information  superhighway advocated by Vice President Al Gore, Microsoft's  operating system, IBM's operating system, Novell's network  integration system, Oracle's network integration system, power  PC', and microprocessors developed by Intel Corporation.    Unfortunately, in Japan no company is capable of competing  with the United States in these fields, nor are there any  competitors in Europe. The United States stands unchallenged in  these fields. Moreover, although it is an industry worth tens of  trillions of yen, it does not appear on trade statistics because  of its specificity: it makes its profit by transmitting  information data, even though the protection of intellectual  property was included in the Uruguay Round agreements recently  signed by the GATT nations, including Japan. The area in which  the United States is planning to make money in the 21st century  was definitely secured by GATT. Meanwhile, Japan made a huge  mistake by considering the agricultural issue as the most  important area of the multilateral trade negotiations. Japan  cannot rid itself of the mental attitudes of the 19th century.  What Japan did regarding the Uruguay Round is beyond criticism.    Why is it impossible for Japan to beat the United States  in this area? It is because the Ministry of Education still  maintains the same education system it had a few decades ago.  Japanese children are still educated and trained to become the  type of "corporate warrior" that has existed for many years.    The Japanese education system is aimed at training people so  they can mass-produce products under strict quality control.  This is why Japanese children are forced to memorize what their  teachers say and act accordingly to what they have stored in  their memories. This educational method was once successful.  However, people educated in this manner are not suited to be  warriors in the intelligence war.    The United States has produced many successful businessmen  such as Bill Gates of Microsoft Corporation, Mitch Kapor and Jim  Manzi of Lotus Development Corporation, and Steven P. Jobs of  Next Computer Corporation (the founder of Apple Computer Inc.).  If these people were born in Japan, they would have constantly  flunked the Japanese education system. Even a man like Ross  Perot falls into this category. Such network integrators as  Electronic Data System Corporation (EDS) and Perot System  Corporation were founded by him. We will soon live in an age  when only people like these will be able to amass vast fortunes.  Unfortunately, such people do not exist in Japan or Europe.    There are many other areas in which the United States can  make money in the 21st century. For instance, there is the  credit card. American Express, Visa, and Mastercard are all  American. The fields of hospital management, rental-car  services, cable TV networks, and hotel-chain management are  mostly dominated by Americans. For instance, such U.S.  companies as Tele-Communications Inc. and Viacom Inc. have the  edge in the field of cable TV. With plenty of money on hand,  Japan and Germany have bought several U.S. companies in these  fields. Nevertheless, the United States continues to take full  control of its knowledge. Concerning the application of  artificial intelligence on Wall Street, many expert analysts,  the so-called "rocket scientists," have participated in the  development project. The long and short of it is that the  United States stands unchallenged in these fields of the 21st  century, fields that require creativity and originality.  <H5>  In One Sense, Japan Is Quite a Museum Piece </H5>   Both the U.S. and Japanese Governments resort to trade  statistics when they hold negotiations on reducing Japan's trade  surplus. The problem is that statistical figures only indicate  the past. As a management consultant, I am thinking about the  future competitive power of Japan and the United States. In my  view, the trade imbalance between Japan and the United States no  longer exists. It is now Japan's turn to supplicate the U.S.  Government for help, saying, "Please do us a favor, because U.S.  companies are now too powerful."    Based on the realities of five years ago, both governments  are still negotiating on how to reduce the $100 billion trade  surplus. The day trade negotiations are concluded, Japan will  probably have to immediately open another round of negotiations  to ask the United States for assistance. Japan will beg on its  knees, saying, "We are now powerless against U.S. companies, so  please give us odds." Twenty years ago, Japan negotiated with  the United States over the textile trade; no more than a year  after the conclusion of the Japan-U.S. textile agreement, the  U.S. textile industry lost its ability to export to Japan, being  threatened by Taiwanese as well as Korean imports. After all,  that is how governmental negotiations are, and we cannot expect  more from them.    Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and President Bill Clinton  should bear these facts in mind when they meet in Washington on  11 February. However, when I checked the contents of the  economic framework talks now under way at the working level, I  realized both governments are totally ignorant of the new  tendency of the times.    I would like to make a proposition to the Japanese  Government. "Please face up to the reality that the United  States already stands unchallenged. It is not too late, so take  stock of the situation immediately."    If we make a thorough investigation, we will immediately  notice that one-half of the $100 billion trade surplus was  yielded by no more than 20 companies, and more precisely by only  two industries--the auto and electronics industries (machine  tools were once a major export item, but not anymore). Thus,  when these 20 companies are ruined, it will be the end of Japan.  As a matter of fact, all these companies are done for now.    Moreover, what is worse is only 13 percent of the Japanese  working population, which totals 67 million people, is employed  by these two industries and their allied industries. The  remaining 87 percent are employed by other secondary industries  such as woodworking, food processing, nonferrous metal  manufacturing, and construction; by primary industries such as  farming and fishing; and by tertiary industries such as  merchandising, including wholesale and retail businesses.    Let us now look into these low-productivity industries that  employ 87 percent of the working population. We can see their  competitive power is almost nothing, or at best it is less than  half of that of the united States. For instance, in the case of  the food processing industry, its competitive strength is  one-third of the U.S. industry's. As regards the retail  business, it is no more than one-quarter.    I am really impressed that Japan has survived until now  despite 87 percent of its working population being  "inefficient." Japan has survived because the "efficient"  population who represent no more than 13 percent of the working  total have shouldered a heavier tax burden and have tolerated  increased costs of living in the form of invisible taxes in  order to recover the loss caused by these "inefficient" people.  The low-productivity industries, which employ 87 percent of the  working population, used to exert strong pressure on the  government. They merely had to present petitions to receive  huge subsidies. Therefore, they had no need to improve their  productivity. For 20 years, starting with the Kakuei Tanaka  cabinet, the government has adopted a policy based on the  principle of distributing wealth rather than creating wealth.    "Inefficient" people employed by low-productivity industries  were suddenly fear-stricken with losing their employment.  Following the conclusion of the Uruguay Round they realized  they were suddenly exposed to international competition.  Imagine nine people hanging off a single-seat airplane.  Despite this, the flight proceeded smoothly until now.  However, one day the pilot was suddenly struck with fear and  lost control of his plane. The result was no one escaped from  the crash. This is exactly what happened to those working in  the low-productivity industries.    There is no doubt the central bureaucracy is the main cause  of this catastrophic situation. By taking advantage of their  departmentalism, every administrative agency has been  maintaining close contacts with a specific industry.  "Inefficient" people have been protected thanks to the  so-called "iron triangle"--the cozy relationship between  politicians, bureaucrats, and business leaders which is seen as  the breeder of graft. In the past, silk-raising farmers,  food-processing companies specializing in konnyaku [paste made  from starch of the devil's tongue], and many other businesses  have been protected. For each category of business, it is  possible to cite the name of a politician acting as its  protector.    The government has long cherished these old-fashioned  industries of the 19th century, so they remain unchanged. In  this sense, Japan is a museum piece. There is no other modern  nation like it. Even in France, industries other than  agriculture have been eliminated. This is because European  industries went through such an ordeal on the occasion of the  creation of a single European market.    To tell the truth, the high appreciation of the yen against  the dollar and the conclusion of the Uruguay Round are  respectively like the two atomic bombs that destroyed Hiroshima  and Nagasaki. However, many have still not awakened to the  situation. They have the same mentality as those who urged a  decisive battle on the Japanese homeland at the end of World War  II.    Once again, Japan has been hit by two atomic bombs. Sooner  or  later Japan will face a serious employment crisis. The  unemployment rate recently reached 2.7 percent, and people are  making a fuss about it. However, the actual condition is much  more serious. I spoke about the advent of massive unemployment  a few years ago while appearing on "Point of View/Point at  Issue," a TV program televised by NHK. During the program, I  used a chart to explain that an unemployment ratio of nearly 14  percent, which had already become a reality in Europe, is within  the bounds of possibility in Japan. I added that unemployment  would increase as follows: an increase of 1 percent caused by  the lifting of the rice ban; another increase of 3 percent  caused by the promotion of market liberalization; another  increase of 6 percent caused by liberalization of the  distribution system; and another increase of 1 percent caused by  the restructuring of medium enterprises and large businesses.    Meanwhile, the government continues to provide "employment  adjustment subsidies" to hard-hit companies so they can continue  to employ excess workers. In other words, the government  continues to spend precious money collected from taxpayers in  order to preserve uncompetitive companies. Such subsidies are  like narcotics. The government has already spent 100 billion  yen in a short period of time. If it does not change its  policy, the final expense will total trillions of yen.  <H5>  "The Aoyama Trading Phenomenon" </H5>   Consumers have been cheated under a system based on the  so-called "iron triangle." The only lucky circumstance is the  "Aoyama Trading phenomenon" which presented itself over the past  few years. The "Aoyama Trading phenomenon" is a revolt by  companies in the service industry in collusion with consumers.    Aoyama Trading Company and Aoki International Company are  two  famous chain-store operators specializing in men's clothing.  They are typical discount retailers. In the United States,  such companies are called category-killers. What kind of  strategy does a category-killer have? It specializes in a very  specific item. This item belongs to a category of consumer's  durable goods which are purchased infrequently. For instance,  with a price ranging from 30,000 to 50,000 yen or more,  ready-made men's suits are a category-killer item. Once the  item is fixed, the category-killer tries to force out retailers  that deal in similar items. Some of the major Japanese  category-killers are: Victoria, well-known for selling ski  equipment at low prices; Yodobashi Camera, well-known for  selling camera equipment at low prices; and Kawachiya, known for  selling cosmetics and liquor at low prices. MK Taxi, which  became the first taxi company to reduce fares following the  government announcement allowing operators to freely set taxi  fares, also falls into this category. In the United States,  this strategy has become the central idea of the distribution  revolution.    A category-killer like Aoyama Trading needs no more than  three years to achieve victory over other companies which are  still trying to somehow impose expensive products on consumers  by resorting to the "iron triangle." Japanese category-killers  are gradually boring holes through the existing system. In the  near future, the entire distribution industry will follow the  example of Aoyama Trading. In the long run, even the housing  industry will be affected by the "Aoyama Trading phenomenon."  For instance, some companies might begin importing tract homes  from Australia to sell at the reasonable price of 100,000 yen  per tsubo [3.954 sq yds].    After World War II, there was a period when many great  challengers appeared one after another: Konosuke Matsushita  (founder of Matsushita Group); Soichiro Honda (founder of Honda  Motor Company); Toshio Iue (founder of Sanyo Electric Company);  Masaru Ibuka (chief founder of Sony Corporation); and Genichi  Kawakami (founder of Yamaha Corporation). Category-killers are  similar to them. They made their own opportunities for new  businesses because the establishment had become too conservative  to devote itself to the defense of its stronghold.    Seen from the consumer viewpoint, the spread of the "Aoyama  Trading phenomenon" should be welcomed. However, in terms of  employment it is contestable. In the United States, most of the  mom-and-pop toy stores folded following the invasion by Toys `R'  Us, a famous toy store chain. This is why many Americans  criticized the company as follows: "It is not right to treat  Chairman Charles Lazarus of Toys `R' Us like a hero because he  created employment destabilization." There is some truth in  that.    However, when we consider the problem, we come to the  conclusion that category-killers would not have appeared on the  scene if those who had been engaged in tedious business had  restructured or rationalized. In any case, even if the  industrial world does not change its stance to create a more  consumer-oriented economy, or even if it continues to put  pressure on the government for the implementation of economic  stimulus measures as well as measures to protect domestic  industries, the restructuring of old-fashioned sectors cannot be  avoided. Moreover, companies unable to restructure themselves  will not survive in the future. Restructuring is the only way  left for Japan.  <H5>  The Deregulation of Controls on 94 Items Is a Childish Trick </H5>   The only problem is whether the current government has the  courage to carry out a fundamental restructuring of Japan.  Prime Minister Hosokawa recently announced the deregulation of  controls on 94 items. However, when we look at the deregulation  carried out by Margaret Thatcher or Ronald Reagan, Hosokawa's  plan seems quite out of the question. In a country like Japan  where 10,900 items are already subject to government control,  and where 500 new items are added to the control list every  year, there is little point in easing controls on 94 items.  Moreover, when we look at the deregulation list presented by  the government, we realize all these deregulatory measures are  harmless and inoffensive. Hosokawa's plan is quite puerile;  this is not deregulation at all.    True deregulation has a strong negative effect. Both U.S.  and British economies which suffered from deregulation in the  1980's are now recovering; it is the turn of other countries to  feel the pain. Countries such as Japan, South Korea, Germany,  and Switzerland, which were blessed by high economic growth in  the 1980's and which have steered clear of deregulation, will  suffer from here on.    Deregulation means a change in the existing rules of  competition. As a result, the actual winner will become the  loser, while the actual loser and newcomer will become the  winner.    It is certain the "Aoyama Trading phenomenon" will spread  across the nation, though the government is pretending not to  notice. It is no longer possible to stop the movement because  Japanese consumers have been cheated and overcharged for too  long. According to OECD and the World Bank, the purchasing  power parity of the dollar to the yen is 1:190. When we take  this figure into consideration, we can see how high commodity  prices are in Japan.    Purchasing power parity represents the mean value of the  cost  of living. It means Japanese consumers are cheated of 80 yen by  the government since the dollar is now quoted at around 110 yen.    So what we need is a politician who can make desperate  efforts to reduce the disparity as much as possible. We need a  government capable of increasing the dollar from the 110 yen to  the 140 yen level, while simultaneously making purchasing power  parity fall from the 190 yen to the 140 yen level. Once these  two goals are achieved, the Japanese market society will become  open and lucid. It will also be possible for Japan to play fair  without facing hesitation from the international community  within the framework of the Uruguay Round.    As I said previously, the spread of the "Aoyama Trading  phenomenon" will create unemployment. Meanwhile, the reduction  of differences between the exchange rate and purchasing power  parity will probably cause employment destabilization as well.  It might even lead to a dreadful consequence: an unemployment  rate of 10 percent.    However, if things work out that way, it will be possible to  build homes at a reasonable price, and land prices will also  decrease. This will create new demands for various products.    For instance, if you buy a new home located 45 minutes  from your office by train, and if the home is two or three times  as spacious as the apartment you currently have, and if the  price is only five times as much as your annual income, you will  inevitably need more utensils because you will have a bigger  kitchen. You will also spend more money on furniture, and will  probably need two cars.    As a matter of course, some industrial sectors will be  eliminated during this process. If unemployment does not  increase to a certain degree, industrial structural reform  cannot be achieved. Conversely, when the economy is in a virtual  state of full employment, the transfer of people from  inefficient to highly competitive sectors is not possible  because people prefer to stay in the same company instead of  moving around. In this sense, it may safely be said that the  modernization of the Japanese economy has been impeded by the  Japanese policy of securing full employment.    The government's duty is not to enable hard-hit companies to  preserve excess workers by providing subsidies. Nor is it to  spend taxes collected from workers in competitive industries for  the sake of inefficient industries. Instead, the government  should provide vocational training so unemployed workers can  acquire new skills and have an opportunity to move to newly  created competitive industries.    What the government must do is not adopt a new economic  stimulus package or implement claptrap measures, namely the  reduction of income taxes. In Japan, personal financial assets  total 600 trillion yen. This is twice as much as the GNP. What  the government must do is mobilize these huge financial  resources. This will certainly stimulate the economy.    Although our financial assets total 600 trillion yen, unlike  in other countries we cannot buy what we wish in Japan because  of the high prices. Articles sold at low price are generally  items we do not want. As we generally live in small houses, our  closets are already filled to the breaking point with various  things. Once the huge financial resources are mobilized, the  economy will recover without fail. We should create a situation  under which people will be able to buy what they want at a price  seen as reasonable from an international viewpoint. In other  words, a recovery of the market mechanism will be sufficient to  help revive the economy, a market so devised that sellers can  always deal with buyers.  <H3>  I Beg Off Fighting a Decisive Battle With the United States  on the Japanese Homeland </H3>   The government pays lip service to implementing a package of  measures designed to pull the economy out of its recession. In  fact, the government is bent on halting the decrease in land  prices and maintaining share prices at the current level in  order to relieve the industrial world. During World War II, the  Imperial Headquarters used this same tactic. By the irony of  fate, the government's trick has helped weaken the people's will  to buy; in other words, it has aggravated the recession. The  purchase of stocks, land, and other immovables will  spontaneously become brisk once prices decrease to a reasonable  level and once there is an abundant supply. In the 1980's, the  government used to set forth the shortage of labor, or the  shortage of land, as a premise. It should no longer do this;  instead it should face up to the reality--that is, the existence  of surplus labor and surplus land. It should revise the  taxation system, which is strangely punitive, and abolish the  complicated procedures needed for approbation and licensing. The  government has as its primary object the improvement of social  infrastructure in consumer-oriented areas. Therefore, it should  channel more public funds into investment aimed at achieving  this object once the mobilization of private funds is realized.  If there is a sharp decline in land prices, the construction  costs of public facilities will be reduced as well. This will  considerably lighten the taxpayers' burden.    In general, people become frugal when they have a smaller  income. In the case of the Japanese Government, the strange  thing is that, although a revenue shortfall of 10 trillion yen  is predicted for this fiscal year, no one proposes curtailing  spending by 10 trillion yen. The bureaucracy has no intention  to reduce it, while the business world is crying loudly for  income tax reductions and a further issuance of government bonds  to finance construction projects. The government thinks it  should meet these two requests in some form.    This is the weakness of a coalition government. Every year  each ministry struggles to secure a larger piece of the  budgetary pie. The ruling coalition, which is a scratch team of  seven parties and one parliamentary group, has no authority over  the bureaucracy, so the government cannot but accept a  bureaucracy-driven draft budget. Here again there is no one who  can see the situation in perspective and decide to undertake a  drastic retrenchment in the budget.    As long as the Japanese have 600 trillion yen in personal  financial assets, and as long as they desire a better standard  of living, hope is not yet dead that Japan will succeed. The  desire for a better standard of living and a more comfortable  life leads to the creation of new products. On the contrary,  the more the government tries to carry out its New Deal--the  economic stimulus package--by arbitrarily taking money out of  taxpayers' purse, the more the situation will worsen.    In the 1980's, Japan used to be qualified as follows:  "Economic strength of the first order; administrative ability  and diplomatic skill of the second order; political technique of  the third order." Now it seems Japan has become a third-rate  country in all aspects. The degeneration was mainly caused by  third-rate politicians who are too intent on political reform to  think of anything else.    I do not want Japan to take the same course the Imperial  Headquarters followed at the end of World War II. The Imperial  Headquarters tried to fight a decisive battle on the Japanese  homeland without seeing the situation in perspective, without  devising any strategy, and without facing up to the reality that  Japan's defeat was already evident. I do not want the current  government to do the same--that is, to try to implement a series  of pump-priming measures that will only help maintain the cozy  relationship between politicians, bureaucrats, and business  leaders.</p>

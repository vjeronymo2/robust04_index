			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Germans freed as Lebanese yield to pressure THE LAST two western hostages in Lebanon - the Germans Heinrich Struebig and Thomas Kemptner - were freed last night after being held for three years. Their release closed a ten-year chapter in Lebanese history when few foreigners ventured into the once cosmopolitan country for fear of being kidnapped. The continued detention of Mr Struebig, 51 and Mr Kemptner, 30, deprived Lebanon of hundreds of millions of dollars in German and European Community reconstruction aid in recent months. The Beirut office of the Iranian news agency, Irna, said the two aid workers were handed over to representatives of the German and Lebanese governments. Lebanese officials said later the men were remaining under tight security at a secret location in Beirut before being handed over to senior German envoys at an official ceremony today. Sources involved in the long negotiations said the German government refused to pay ransom for the hostages or even discuss the possibility of liberating Mohammed and Abbas Hamadi, the two Shia Moslem Lebanese brothers whose freedom was demanded by the kidnappers. The men are in jail in Germany for murder and kidnapping. In recent months, the governments of Lebanon, Iran and Syria put unrelenting pressure on Mr Abdul-Hadi Hamadi, security chief of the pro-Iranian Hizbollah militia, who was responsible for the Germans' abduction. He is a brother of Mohammed and Abbas Hamadi. Last night's release marked the first time that the Lebanese government was directly involved in the liberation of western hostages. Lebanon desperately needs reconstruction aid blocked by Germany pending the release, and President Elias Hrawi's government in February established a special commission to work for the Germans' freedom. A Lebanese delegation went to Tehran to win Iranian support and Mr Ali Akbar Velayati, the Iranian foreign minister, made his first official visit to Beirut last week. His meetings with government and Hizbollah officials are believed to have been decisive in final arrangements for the Germans' release. Iran - whose principal western trade partner is Germany - sought to eliminate an impediment in trade relations and achieve greater acceptance in the west. Like Lebanon and Iran, Syria stood to gain a degree of rehabilitation in western eyes by helping to end the hostage saga. Mr Giandomenico Picco, the United Nations envoy who engineered the liberation of nine British and American hostages last year, also assisted in the negotiations, shuttling between New York, Bonn and the Middle East. Mr Picco arrived in Damascus at the weekend to deal with a last minute hitch. The kidnappers had wanted to release one hostage now, the other later. Security sources in Lebanon claimed the Germans, unlike other hostages, had sympathised with their captors' motives.</p>

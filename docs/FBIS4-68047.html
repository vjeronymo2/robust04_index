			<p>BFN     [Text] Lima, 1 May (EFE) --The local news media today  reported that security forces have liberated 1,135 Peruvian  Ashaninka people who were being held by the Shining Path [SL]  terrorist gang.    The Ashaninkas were freed from several villages on the banks  of the Ene River, in Satipo Province, Junin Department, a jungle  area in the Peruvian central mountain region.    Journalists state that the captives had been literally  enslaved by the maoist gang. They are suffering from  malnutrition and many appear to have tuberculosis.    The Ashaninkas were freed by the Army units in the course of  recent operations.

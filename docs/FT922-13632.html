			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / International Capital Markets: Globex launch threatens to disrupt Europe's future - The 24-hour trading system which may increase competition between European exchanges The launch in June of Globex, the around-the-clock futures trading system, could increase the level of competition between Europe's futures exchanges. The system, developed by the Chicago Board of Trade, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Reuter, will initially list US products; pressure on European exchanges to join the system will increase when Globex starts to trade European products later this year. So far, the Matif in Paris is the only European exchange to sign up. Its Paris interbank offered rate (Pibor), notional French government bond and Ecu bond contracts will be listed when the exchange links up in about six months time. Several other exchanges are in fairly advanced discussions with Globex. The system is expected 'to capture new customers (for existing products) by reducing barriers like time-zone differentials and lack of familiarity,' said Mr Gary Ginter, managing director of Globex. It is an order-matching system designed to complement open-outcry trading on exchanges. However, its impact will be stronger where competition between exchange-traded products already exists. For example, the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange's Eurodollar futures contract, which is hardly thriving with average daily volume of around 4,000 contracts a day, could be virtually wiped out. The CME's highly liquid Eurodollar contract, along with the CBOT's 30-year Treasury future, will be added to the system later this year. The first contracts to be traded will be the less active currency contracts listed on the CME, and the 10-year Treasury contract on the CBOT. The CME is currently deep in discussions with Simex, the Singapore futures exchange, which has a highly successful Eurodollar contract, on how to continue to work together. Talks with Simex over Globex will then resume. A more serious threat is that the Deutsche Terminborse, the German futures exchange, may join Globex soon and list its German Bund contract on the system. Under Globex rules, rival contracts cannot be listed until a clear winner has been established - if both exchanges involved are members of the system. Liffe's Bund contract is more heavily traded than the DTB's but the German exchange has been battling to win back market share, and trading on Globex could help advance that cause. Mr Friedrich Wahl, chief executive of DTB, said the exchange 'will intensify the dialogue' with Globex. Discussions will focus on which contracts could be traded on the system and how to create the necessary technical links, he said. Liffe, however, is still not close to an agreement. 'We have been having discussions with Globex for three years, but the restrictions in the Globex agreement are still not acceptable to the Liffe board,' said Mr David Burton, Liffe's chairman. However, Mr Burton is aware the competitive threat from Globex is 'something we have to address'. It is still possible that Liffe will join Globex at a later date; alternatively, Liffe's APT after-hours screen trading system could be developed to operate as a global system to compete with Globex (an order-matching rather than a trading system). The issue will be discussed at a strategic planning meeting of Liffe board members later this month. Globex - with just the CBOT, the CME, the Matif and the New York exchanges (excluding Nymex which is developing a rival system) - can claim to give access to 60-70 per cent of the world's futures trading. Banks and brokers do not doubt that they will need to use the system in order to meet customer demand. 'We have to use the system because our competitors will be using it,' said Mr John Woodbyrne, futures desk manager at Credit Lyonnais Rouse. Claims that Globex is set to transform derivatives trading may have been exaggerated. Mr Burton believes 'the competitive threat is minimal in markets based in Europe,' because of the concentration of liquidity. But there is little doubt the system will concentrate the minds of Europe's competing futures exchanges. OM, the Swedish futures exchange, will start trading futures and options on its LDCx index of less developed country debt on May 5.</p>

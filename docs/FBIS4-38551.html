			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President Askar Akayev by Boris Toumanov in </F> Moscow; date not given: "Kyrgyzstan: A Bridge Between East and  West" -- first paragraph is LA LIBRE BELGIQUE introduction]    [Text] Askar Akayev, president of the Central Asian  republic of Kyrgyzstan, will arrive on a visit to Belgium on  Tuesday [31 May]. During the visit, he will meet with Belgian  leaders and European Union [EU] and NATO officials. Before he  left, he explained to our correspondent in Moscow the purpose of  the visit and the limits on the cooperation he envisages with  the twelve. Kyrgyzstan, he said, wants to be a bridge between  East and West. [Akayev] Kyrgyzstan is currently taking  only its first steps on the road toward a market economy,  democracy, and integration into the world community. I am still  convinced that we will see fruitful cooperation between our two  countries.  <H5>  With NATO, Too </H5>   [Toumanov] What do you expect on the practical level from  your contacts in Brussels with the EU and NATO? Does your  country plan to participate in the Partnership for Peace?    [Akayev] A few days ago, the EU and Kyrgyzstan initialed the  agreement on partnership and cooperation. Kyrgyzstan is keen to  develop cooperation with the military-political union of NATO,  especially in the field of technical aid and environmental  conservation and protection. We believe the Partnership for  Peace to be an important document contributing to the efforts  toward consolidating peace and security on the Europe-Asia  continent, and that is why Kyrgyzstan intends to participate in  this initiative.    [Toumanov] You are virtually the only leader of a CIS state  to support the proposal to transform the CIS into a Euro-Asiatic  union running along the same lines as the EU. At the same time,  many observers explain Moscow's frosty welcome for this  initiative because of its strictly egalitarian nature which runs  counter to the "assembly of lands" logic that currently  dominates Russian politics. Do you think this trend endangers  the processes of integration within the CIS, and how do you see  the Community evolving in this context?    [Akayev] We support any initiative likely to consolidate the  CIS and we consider that the creation of bilateral or  multilateral unions in the community contributes greatly to  this. As far as the "assembly of lands" logic is concerned, I  must point out that Kyrgyzstan is in favor of a tighter union of  the new independent states. In any case, it is no longer  possible to return to a union based on the criteria of the old  totalitarian system.  <H5>  Between Russia and China </H5>   [Toumanov] Since Kyrgyzstan became independent -- while  maintaining its traditional relations with Russia -- it has been  unable to avoid the influence of geopolitical factors, such as  the fact that it borders on China. What role does this fact  play in regional policy? Is your country concerned about the  geographical proximity of the nuclear range of Lob Nor?    [Akayev] Russia is still our privileged partner in the  economic, military, and political domain, and we want to  strengthen and develop this cooperation in the future. However,  we enjoy excellent and good-neighborly relations with China.  Kyrgyzstan's geopolitical situation means that we have to play  a positive role as a bridge linking East and West. As for the  Lob Nor range, our action is based on the criteria of the  international conventions directed toward putting a global end  to nuclear testing.    [Toumanov] What role do you think the "Islamic factor" has  to  play in the civil war in neighboring Tajikistan? Does it  represent a real threat to stability in Central Asia?    [Akayev] The main reason for the civil war in Tajikistan is  the fight for power between the clans, a war that began far back  in history. The religious factor has never been anything more  than an instrument of this rivalry to which the servants of  Islam often fall prey. The "Islamization" of the newly  independent states is very unlikely to become a danger for  Central Asia whose stability is, on the contrary, above all  threatened by the lack of a suitable culture and a suitable  legal basis for relations between the states of the region.</p>

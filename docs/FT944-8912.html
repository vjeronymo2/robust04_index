			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / International Company News: Japanese boost for foreign brokers Foreign brokers operating in Japan saw a rise in revenue in the six months to September due to a sharp rise in trading profits, in contrast to their Japanese counterparts, who suffered declines in stock commissions. The Japan Securities Dealers' Association said the 48 foreign brokerage houses posted combined operating revenue of Y274bn (Dollars 2.78bn), up 18 per cent from a year earlier. The 215 domestic houses posted a 18 per cent fall in operating revenues to Y1,012.8bn. Foreign brokers derive the bulk of their profits from derivatives trading, and rely less on stock commissions than the Japanese houses. The foreign houses posted a 31 per cent fall in combined recurring profits to Y23.8bn while operating profits fell 23 per cent to Y24.6bn. The Japanese brokerage houses posted combined recurring losses of Y85.2bn while operating losses totalled Y90.7bn. Commission income at the foreign houses remained flat at Y128.9bn, while the domestic companies fell 11 per cent to Y806.4bn. Trading profits totalled Y53.2bn at the Japanese houses, down 62 per cent, while the foreign houses saw a 36 per cent rise in profits to Y101.2bn. Meanwhile, Nomura Securities saw interim consolidated pre-tax profits plunge 84 per cent due to weak profits on bond trading at its overseas subsidiaries. The figure, based on US accounting standards, totalled Y8.7bn, while revenue declined 14 per cent to Y291.1bn. After-tax profits plunged 94 per cent to Y1.6bn. Consolidated revenue from commissions fell 12 per cent to Y100.8bn, reflecting lower trading volume on the domestic stock market. Higher interest rates in the US hurt net gains on trading, which declined 39 per cent to Y21.3bn. Underwriting and distribution revenues rose 39 per cent to Y57.5bn. Costs excluding interest expenses for the first half rose 2 per cent to Y211bn while interest expenses fell 8 per cent to Y71bn.</p>

			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Manchester United up to Pounds 8.2m - Pre-tax outcome hit by increased spending on player transfers IN THE year in which it finally fulfilled 26 years of fans' expectations by becoming League champions, Manchester United lifted profits before transfer fees from Pounds 7.68m to Pounds 8.19m. At the pre-tax level for the 12 months to July 31, profits declined to Pounds 4.2m (Pounds 5.06m), adversely affected by net expenditure on the transfer of players which rose from Pounds 2.63m to Pounds 3.99m - with money spent on players totalling Pounds 6.02m. This included the purchase of Roy Keane for Pounds 3.75m, and Eric Cantona and Dion Dublin for Pounds 1m apiece. The shares closed down 15p at 542p. The aggregate value of the first team squad, as reported by Touche Ross, was Pounds 30m (Pounds 24m). Interest receivable declined to Pounds 796,000 (Pounds 1.42m) as cash and gilt-edged stock fell to Pounds 7.76m (Pounds 14.8m) after capital investment of Pounds 12m, with the rebuilding of the Stretford End at the Old Trafford ground coming in under budget at Pounds 10.3m. Cash generated was Pounds 4.1m. The operating surplus of Pounds 7.39m (Pounds 6.27m) was achieved on turnover up at Pounds 25.2m (Pounds 20.1m). This grew in spite of a 4 per cent reduction in gate receipts to Pounds 10.7m (Pounds 11.1m) mainly due to the rebuilding. Turnover from television rose to Pounds 3.85m (Pounds 1.84m), thanks, the company said, to improved arrangements under the senior league and winning the championship. Sponsorship, advertising, first-time royalties from Umbro and increased sales of replica kits contributed more at Pounds 3.62m (Pounds 2.76m), and in spite of the reduced capacity, conference and catering activities turnover rose to Pounds 1.81m (Pounds 1.7m). The strongest growth in turnover came from the merchandising division where there was a 93 per cent rise to Pounds 5.23m (Pounds 2.71m). A joint venture retail store has recently been opened in Belfast and Mr Robin Launders, group finance director, said the launch of a credit card was likely soon and that there would be an announcement about financial services offers on Friday. Below the line, Pounds 1m was appropriated from the transfer fee reserve - 'essentially a dividend protection reserve', according to Mr Launders - to give earnings per share after appropriation of 32.5p (27.6p), or 24.3p (29.7p) before. The final dividend is lifted to 13.5p (12p) for a total of 19.5p (18p). The fortunes of the club will be significantly boosted should it defeat Galatasary of Turkey in the European Champions Cup and progress to the lucrative mini-league stage.</p>

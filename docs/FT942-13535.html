			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / Sentiment grows for SDR hike Finance ministers from the industrialised countries are showing a greater willingness to listen to the International Monetary Fund's ideas for expanding the level of currency reserves in the world financial system. Yesterday's meeting of finance ministers from the Group of Seven leading industrialised countries was expected once again to rebuff the IMF's requests for a new issue of special drawing rights, the basket of currencies which the Fund uses as its own accounting unit and which serves as a reserve asset. Nevertheless, officials indicated they were sympathetic to the shortage of international reserves experienced notably by the countries of eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, which were not members of the IMF the last time new SDRs were issued. A G7 official said other ideas could involve changing IMF's limits for access to loans by borrowing countries, calculated as a percentage of each country's stake in the Fund. Russia strongly supports the allocation proposal, which officials say should amount to SDRs16bn (Pounds 16.8bn) in a first tranche, followed by four annual issues of SDRs5bn.</p>

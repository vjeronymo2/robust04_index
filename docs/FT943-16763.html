			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / World Commodities Prices: Coffee sets record tumbling - Week in the Markets Coffee, which has been leading the averages in the world commodity league for some time, put in a performance worthy of Brian Lara this week. Records tumbled as futures prices surged on both sides of the Atlantic in response to Monday's news of damaging frosts in Brazilian growing areas. That day's Dollars 593-a-tonne rise for second position futures at the London Commodity Exchange was the biggest ever, as was the Dollars 943 rise on the week to Dollars 3,198 a tonne. And, coming on top of price advances in a wide range of other commodities in recent weeks, coffee's dizzying rise lifted the Reuter Commodity Index to an all-time high. The degree of damage to next year's Brazilian coffee crop remains in doubt, with estimates of bean losses from a previously expected harvest of 24m bags (60kg each) ranging from 5m to 9m bags. Even if the damage turns out to be at the lower end of the scale, however, prospects for a price retreat will be limited by the fact that it came so early in the season, with six weeks to go before the frost risk period is over. Brazil's worst-ever coffee frost, which took out nearly three quarters of the following year's crop, hit in mid-July, 1975. The market impact of this blow to the 1995-96 crop was heightened on Thursday night by a US Department of Agriculture report indicating that the season will start with world stocks of coffee already at a historic low. The department estimated that global consumption of coffee in the 1994-95 season, at 99.6m bags, would exceed production by 9m, taking stocks below 22m. It was in response to that news that the LCE second position leapt yesterday morning to a peak of Dollars 3,300 a tonne, traders said. Mr Lawrence Eagles, analyst at London broker GNI, pointed out, however, that the USDA assessment was made before this weeks market fireworks and said that the higher prices might result in the deficit being reduced by as much as 2m bags. He also suggested that the Brazilian government would see the price rise as an opportunity to dispose of its 17m bags of stocks, which it saw as a constraint on its coffee policy. At the London Metal Exchange copper lead a general upturn in base metals markets from midweek. But only aluminium and lead managed to finish with net gains. Having dipped below Dollars 2,380 a tonne on Wednesday the three months copper price closed yesterday at Dollars 2,441.50 a tonne, down Dollars 26 on balance. Aluminium's rally, which began a day earlier than copper's, was aided yesterday by news of a big cut in LME warehouse stocks, the fifth in succession. The three months price closed at Dollars 1,510.50 a tonne, up Dollars 20 overall and Dollars 55.50 above Tuesday's low. Lead was also helped by an LME stocks fall as it bounded to a 21-month high yesterday. Three months metal closes at Dollars 582.50, up Dollars 22 on the week, and dealers were not ruling out further gains. 'Fundamentally the lead market looks quite constructive, and people are probably targeting significantly higher numbers,' one told Reuter. Precious metals fared less well. The gold finished Dollars 6.70 down at Dollars 385 a troy ounce, having sustained most when US investment funds turned against the market on Monday. Dealers suggested that the funds were reacting to disappointment at the metal's failure to profit from the dollar's weakness. Silver was also lower but platinum bounced yesterday on consumer buying.  --------------------------------------------------------                LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS  -------------------------------------------------------- (As at Thursday's close)                       tonnes  -------------------------------------------------------- Aluminium                    -20,500   to   2,607,875 Aluminium alloy                 -160   to      29,760 Copper                        -1,725   to     353,925 Lead                          -4,975   to     354,725 Nickel                          +186   to     132,684 Zinc                            +225   to   1,197,075 Tin                              +80   to      30,965  --------------------------------------------------------</p>

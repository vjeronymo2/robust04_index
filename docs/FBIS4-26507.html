			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 23 (AFP) -- China's official media  played up Thursday relief efforts in six southern provinces hit  by severe flooding, but continued to hide the high death toll in  the disaster from the Chinese people.    The PEOPLE'S DAILY, the party mouthpiece, quoted Vice  Premier  Zou Jiahua, who is heading a central government task force to  southwestern Guangxi, as expressing his satisfaction with relief  efforts after touring badly hit areas for two days.    According to a ministry of civil affairs statement released  to foreign news organisations Wednesday, 719 people have died in  two weeks of severe flooding that has caused economic losses of  some 30.54 billion yuan (3.51 billion dollars) in the six  provinces.    Central Hunan has been worst hit with 190 fatalities, while  174 people have died in southern Guangdong, 141 in southwestern  Guangxi, 80 in southeasten Fujian, 68 in eastern Zhejiang and 66  in southeastern Jiangxi as of Wednesday, according to the  ministry's figures.    In a similar statement revealing the extent of the disaster  earlier in the week, the ministry appealed for foreign aid for  relief efforts.    Chinese citizens, meanwhile, have been given few details of  casualties and economic losses, fed instead a daily diet of  propaganda extolling local governments' commitment to helping  local residents and the heroism of People's Liberation Army  soldiers on the front line of relief work.    Zhou was quoted as saying the main tasks were ensuring food  supplies for local people, stepping up efforts to restore  transport links and carrying out effective disease prevention  work to stop the outbreak of any epidemics.    "Southern China's flood season has only just begun, we must  prepare with a long-term flood prevention attitude and by no  means treat the matter lightly," the PEOPLE'S DAILY quoted Zhou  as saying.    The central government had as of Wednesday released six  million yuan in relief aid, divided equally between Guangdong,  Guangxi and Hunan.    The paper said that in Fujian there had been "severe losses  in human life and property," but gave no precise details.    Local officials were again quoted as stressing their  courageous efforts at bringing relief to citizens, saying  special funds had been released and eight task forces dispatched.    Some 10,000 soldiers, police and local paramilitary officers  and 3,000 vehicles are taking part in the relief work, it said.</p>

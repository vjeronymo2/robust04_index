			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / USSR diehards challenge Moscow ABOUT 5,000 troops are being drafted in to guard the Kremlin today as the authorities take extraordinary precautions to preserve the peace at demonstrations planned by communist and nationalist forces in the centre of Moscow. Organisers of an extraordinary session of the Congress of Peoples' Deputies of the USSR (photograph right) - dissolved last year shortly before the Soviet Union itself was consigned to history's dustbin - are, meanwhile, taking even more extraordinary precautions to disguise the venue. The participants will gather early today outside the Moskva Hotel and drive in coaches to a clandestine destination. One possible venue is the offices of Pravda, the former main newspaper of the Soviet Communist Party which suspended publication on Saturday due to debts. The aim of the congress is to muster support for the recreation of the Soviet Union - a state which the organisers say still exists because of the continuing interdependence of its former republics. The Russian and Moscow authorities are treating the demonstration and the congress as dangerous manifestations amounting to possible attempts at an overthrow of the government. Mr Gavriil Popov, the Moscow mayor, has allowed the demonstration to take place on the central Manezh Square provided it does not block the traffic. But Mr Serghei Shakhrai, the deputy prime minister of Russia, said the demonstration and the session were 'a very serious matter', and warned of possible violence. So far, however, the organisers of the demonstrations appear to lack mass followings, while the organising committee of the congress are distinguished more by their paranoia than by their power. They are charging the Russian authorities with being both repressive and fearful of them. Colonel Nikolai Petrushenko, who was once, with Colonel Victor Alksnis, one of the feared 'black colonels' of the Soyuz group of USSR deputies, complained yesterday that he had been reported to the police when he checked into the Moskva Hotel. Mrs Saji Umalatova, one of the main organisers, said heavy government pressure had frightened off many who might otherwise have attended. Mr Yuri Golik, a Russian deputy, gave the most optimistic asessment of today's attendance when he said that 1,470 deputies - out of a former count of 2,250 - had said they would attend, but 'we cannot tell how many will actually arrive in Moscow'.</p>

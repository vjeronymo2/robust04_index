			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Howe presses Major to ignore Eurosceptics Mr John Major, the prime minister, was warned bluntly last night by Lord Howe, the former foreign secretary, to ignore pressure from Conservative sceptics to exclude Britain from the next stage of European integration. On the eve of the Tory party conference and of publication of his own political memoirs, Lord Howe voiced his dismay at the 'strong, sustained and growing background of hostility' to Mr Major's pledge when he first entered Downing Street that he would keep Britain at the heart of Europe. He spoke as leading members of the Tory right - including Lord Tebbit and Mr Norman Lamont - prepared to demand at the Bournemouth conference assurances that Mr Major will reject further encroachment on British sovereignty. Mr Lamont, former chancellor, is expected to insist in an appearance on the conference fringe that Mr Major pledges that Britain will take no part in a single European currency. But Lord Howe, whose resignation over European policy precipitated Lady Thatcher's downfall in 1990, said the case for Britain retaining a central role in shaping Europe's future had become stronger. Voicing in public the views of pro-European ministers such as Mr Kenneth Clarke, Mr Michael Heseltine and Mr David Hunt, he told the magazine of the Tory Reform Group: 'The case for ensuring that Europe is not dominated by a Continental partnership from which Britain is excluded is proving itself stronger and stronger with every day that passes.' In a sideswipe at Mr Major's suggestion that the creation of a multi-speed Europe would allow Britain to opt out of more areas of integration, Lord Howe said: 'If we are a member of a European club in which we find ourselves, by our own choice, more unequal than others in most areas, then there is a danger of creating the two-speed, second-division future for Europe which we claim we don't want.' Britain could be slower-moving in areas such as social policy and monetary union but 'the central thrust of our policy has to be devoted to participation in the European Union'. In spite of confidence in the Tory hierarchy that this week it can avoid the bitter fights over Europe which dogged the last two annual conferences, it was clear last night that both sides were determined to stake out their ground. Mr Hunt, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, intends to use a speech on the fringe to stress that Britain cannot withdraw from 'the heart of Europe'. But Mr John Redwood, the Welsh secretary, spoke for the Eurosceptic side of the cabinet table when he insisted yesterday that there was no question of Britain participating in a single currency for 'the foreseeable future'.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 4. The trustees of each of the Trusts, including a majority of the independent trustees, shall have approved the Multiple Pricing System, prior to the implementation of the Multiple Pricing System by a particular series. The minutes of the meetings of the trustees regarding their deliberations with respect to the approvals necessary to implement the Multiple Pricing System will reflect in detail the reasons for determining that the Multiple Pricing System is in the best interest of both the series and their respective shareholders. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. The initial determination of the Class Expenses, if any, that will be allocated to a particular class of a series and any subsequent changes thereto will be reviewed and approved by a vote of the trustees, including a majority of the independent trustees. Any person authorized to direct the allocation and disposition of monies paid or payable by a series to meet Class Expenses shall provide to the trustees, and the trustees shall review, at least quarterly, a written report of the amounts so expended and the purpose for which such expenditures were made. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. On an ongoing basis, the trustees, pursuant to their fiduciary responsibilities under the Act and otherwise, will monitor each series for the existence of any material conflicts among the interests of the various classes of shares. The trustees, including a majority of the independent trustees, shall take such action as is reasonably necessary to eliminate any such conflicts that may develop. The Advisers and the Distributors will be responsible for reporting any potential or existing conflicts to the trustees. If a conflict arises, the Advisers and the Distributors at their own costs will remedy such conflict up to and including establishing a new registered management investment company. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. The trustees will receive quarterly and annual statements concerning distribution and shareholder servicing expenditures complying with paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of rule 12b&hyph;1, as it may be amended from time to time. In the statements, only distribution expenditures properly attributable to the sale or servicing of a class of shares will be used to support any rule 12b&hyph;1 plan or shareholder services plan expenditures charged to such class. Expenditures not related to the sale or servicing of a specific class will not be presented to the trustees to support rule 12b&hyph;1 plan or shareholder services plan expenditures charged to shareholders of such class of shares. The statements, including the allocations upon which they are based, will be subject to the review and approval of the independent trustees in the exercise of their fiduciary duties. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. If any class will be subject to a shareholder services plan, such shareholder services plan will be adopted and operated in accordance with the procedures set forth in rule 12b&hyph;1(b) through (f) as if the expenditures made thereunder were subject to rule 12b&hyph;1, except that shareholders will not enjoy the voting rights specified in rule 12b&hyph;1. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. Dividends paid by a series with respect to each class of shares, to the extent any dividends are paid, will be calculated in the same manner, at the same time, on the same day, and will be in the same amount, except that expenditures associated with any rule 12b&hyph;1 plan or shareholder services plan and any Class Expense will be borne by the affected class. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. The methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset value and dividends/distributions of the various classes and the proper allocation of income and expenses among such classes has been reviewed by an expert (the ``Expert''). The Expert has rendered a report to the applicants (and such report has been filed with the SEC as an exhibit to the application), stating that such methodology and procedures are adequate to ensure that such calculations and allocations will be made in an appropriate manner. On an ongoing basis, the Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert, will monitor the manner in which the calculations and allocations are being made and based upon such review, will render at least annually a report to the Trusts that the calculations and allocations are being made properly. The reports of the Expert shall be filed as part of the periodic reports filed with the SEC pursuant to sections 30(a) and 30(b)(1) of the Act. The work papers of the Experts with respect to such reports, following request by the Trusts (which the Trusts agree to make), will be available for inspection by the SEC staff upon the written request for such work papers by a senior member of the Division of Investment Management or of a Regional Office of the SEC, limited to the Director, an Associate Director, the Chief Accountant, the Chief Financial Analyst, any Assistant Director, and any Regional Administrator or Associate and Assistant Administrator. The initial report of the Expert is a ``report on policies and procedures placed in operation'' and the ongoing reports will be ``reports on policies and procedures placed in operation and tests of operating effectiveness'' as defined and described in SAS No. 70 of the AICPA, as it may be amended from time to time, or in similar auditing standards as may be adopted by the AICPA from time to time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11. Applicants have adequate facilities in place to ensure implementation of the methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset value and dividends/distributions among the various classes of shares and the proper allocation of income and expenses among such classes of shares and this representation will be concurred with by the Expert in the initial report referred to in condition 10 above and will be concurred with by the Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert, on an ongoing basis at least annually in the ongoing reports referred to in condition 10 above. The applicants agree to take immediate corrective action if the Expert, or appropriate substitute Expert, does not so concur in the ongoing reports. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12. The prospectuses of the series relating to each class of shares will contain a statement to the effect that financial institutions, groups, and any other person entitled to receive any compensation for selling series shares may receive different levels of compensation for selling one particular class of shares over another in a series. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

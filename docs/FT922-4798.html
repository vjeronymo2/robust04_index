			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Campaigns that will be pressed to a successful conclusion - The Battle for Midland THE MEN at the top of the three banks involved in the takeover battle for Midland Bank yesterday all expressed determination to press their campaigns to a successful conclusion. Mr Brian Pitman, chief executive of Lloyds, left the International Monetary Conference annual meeting in Toronto early last night in order to fly home to plan his bank's response to the improved offer from Hongkong and Shanghai. He said he had not been surprised by Hongkong Bank's move, having watched 'what was going on in the stock market'. Mr Pitman would not rule out his bank launching a raid in the stock market on Midland's shares, to persuade Midland's shareholders of its confidence in the battle. 'We would have to get the permission of the Secretary of State (for Trade and Industry),' he said. Mr Pitman said Lloyds would decide how to respond to Hongkong Bank's move when its board meets later this week. He said he wanted to see how Midland's shareholders reacted to the Hongkong Bank move. Mr Pitman also pointed out that the value of the terms Lloyds was currently proposing was not much below Hongkong Bank's new bid terms. He said: 'We will have to tell Midland's shareholders what our offer is worth now and what it could be worth later'. He said he remained convinced that 'people see the commercial logic of what we are doing'. Lloyds proposal to buy Midland is being investigated for the next three months by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. However, Midland's shareholders have to make up their minds whether to accept Hongkong Bank's terms by June 25, long before the MMC investigation is finished. Mr William Purves, chairman of Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, who is also in Toronto and is this year's IMC president, said that despite being on the opposite sides of a takeover campaign, 'no words other than friendly words' had passed between himself and Mr Pitman. 'We have known each other a long time,' he said. Mr Purves said his bank's new bid terms were 'definitely the final offer'. He had decided to improve the offer now, much earlier than he had needed to under the Takeover Code, because it was 'time to get uncertainty away from the thing'. His bank is holding an extraordinary meeting of its shareholders on June 9 and Mr Purves thought it was 'better if shareholders know what we are doing' before the meeting. He had decided to provide cash as part of the offer because 'we listen to what the institutions are saying. The institutions were not happy with the loan stock'. Nonetheless, he thought some institutions would choose to keep the loan stock, rather than opting for the cash alternative, since the coupon on the loan stock had been raised. Mr Purves felt able to raise the offer because the 'perception of the value of Midland' had improved. He said there were signs that loan loss provisions of UK banks in general were falling. Mr Brian Pearse, chief executive of Midland, warned shareholders that they would have to realise by June 25 that if they rejected the board's recommendation the directors 'would have to think very long and hard before they invited the Hongkong Bank to come back for a second bid.'</p>

BMP Plan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Preparation of a Best Management Practices (BMP) Plan shall be prepared in conjunction with development of the Remedial Action Plan required by Florida Department of Environmental Protection (See Part II.F.c.). The permittee shall maintain the BMP plan at the facility and shall make the plan available to the permit issuing authority upon request. The ``NPDES Guidance Document'' can be used as a reference which contains technical information on BMPs and the elements of the BMP program. The permittee shall develop and implement a BMP plan which prevents, or minimizes the potential for, the release of pollutants from ancillary activities, including material storage areas; plant site runoff; in-plant transfer, process and material handling areas; loading and unloading operations, and sludge and waste disposal areas, to the waters of the United States through plant site runoff; spillage or leaks; sludge or waste disposal; or drainage from raw material storage. The term pollutants refers to any substance listed as toxic under Section 307(a)(1) of the Clean Water Act, oil, as defined in Section 311(a)(1) of the Act, and substance listed as hazardous under Section 311 of the Act. Copies of the ``NPDES Guidance Document'' may be obtained by submitting written requests to: Director, Water Management Division, U.S. EPA Region IV, 345 Courtland St. N.E., Atlanta, Georgia 30365.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2.

If more than one (1) outfall exists, separate tests will be performed on each outfall. All test species, procedures and quality assurance criteria used shall be in accordance with  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Methods for Measuring the Acute Toxicity of Effluents to Freshwater and Marine Organisms <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , EPA/600/4&hyph;90/027F, or the most current edition. The dilution/control water used will be moderately hard water as described in EPA/600/4&hyph;90/027F, Section 7, or the most current edition. A standard reference toxicant quality assurance test shall be conducted concurrently with each species used in the toxicity tests and the results submitted with the discharge monitoring report (DMR). Alternatively, if monthly QA/QC reference toxicant tests are conducted, these results must be submitted with the DMR.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. a. The permittee shall conduct 96-hour acute static-renewal multi-concentration toxicity tests using the daphnid ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Ceriodaphnia dubia <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) and the fathead minnow ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Pimephales promelas <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). All tests shall be conducted on one grab sample of 100% final effluent. All tests shall be conducted on a control (0%) and the following dilution concentrations at a minimum: 100.0%, 50.0%, 25.0%, 12.5%, and 6.25%. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

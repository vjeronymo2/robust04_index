			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> GUNMAN YELLS 'WHITE POWER' BEFORE INJURING 4 AT PARTY IN TARZANA;  </P> <P> VIOLENCE: POLICE LATER ARREST A CANOGA PARK MAN AND CALL THE ATTACK 'RACIALLY  MOTIVATED.' TWO OF THE VICTIMS ARE REPORTED IN SERIOUS CONDITION.  </P> <P> Four people were injured when a gunman shouted, "White power!" and fired into a  crowd of party-goers outside a house in Tarzana, police said Saturday.  </P> <P> The incident occurred about 11:45 p.m. Friday in the 4700 block of Hermano  Drive, a sloping cul-de-sac lined with expensive houses, including a gated  mansion at the top of the hill, Los Angeles Police Officer Victor Monroe said.  The attack was "racially motivated," he said.  </P> <P> A white man on foot shouted the slogan and then fired into a group of people  outside the house, Monroe said. Two of those injured were hospitalized in  serious but stable condition, he said.  </P> <P> About 200 to 300 people attended the racially mixed party, Monroe said.  </P> <P> Police refused to identify the victims, their race or the hospital or hospitals  where they were taken. Richard Perelman, a neighbor and the owner of a  furniture store, said he heard six shots and then teen-agers knocked on his  door, crying and screaming for him to call an ambulance, which he did.  </P> <P> "It was tragic -- the kids were really shook up," Perelman said. "We don't  expect that in this neighborhood."  </P> <P> Shortly after the incident, police arrested Jeffrey Scott Johnson, 20, of  Canoga Park at his residence on suspicion of attempted murder. Monroe would not  disclose what caused police to suspect Johnson.  </P> <P> Johnson was being held without bail Saturday at the West Valley Jail.  </P> <P> Harry Palmer, manager of the apartment complex in the 20000 block of Leadwell  Street where Johnson lives with his girlfriend and infant daughter, described  Johnson as an affable San Fernando Valley native. Palmer said Johnson worked  with his stepfather installing air-conditioning devices and that he and Johnson  had a beer together the night of the shooting.  </P> <P> "They've got the wrong guy," Palmer said. "To say that Jeff would take a gun  and yell, 'White supremacy,' well, he just isn't that type of guy."  </P></p>

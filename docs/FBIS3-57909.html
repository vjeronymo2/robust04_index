			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Hans Joerg Sottorf: "Renewal Process in the </F> SPD"]    [Text] In the 1970's, the Christian Democratic Union [CDU]  developed from a highly economically oriented party to a real  people's party on the basis of the "New Social Problem," which  was discovered and expounded by Heiner Geissler and was  reflected in the Mannheim programmatic statement of 1975. This  is one of the reasons the party was very successful in the  1980's. The Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] is  currently undergoing a process in the other direction that has  remained largely unnoticed. For decades it was considered the  classical social welfare party, and in opinion polls citizens  made it clear that they considered the SPD responsible in this  area. Now the strategists around Rudolf Scharping, the new  party chairman, have realized that they must open the party to a  "New Economic Problem" if the social democrats want to win and  retain a majority over the long term. The SPD is finally going  to be given a new economic profile, as has been demanded for a  long time.    Scharping, who is setting up an election campaign team and  is  looking for expert advisers in many policy areas, attaches  special importance to economic policy advice. Even though the  SPD moved away from its state economy ideology and adopted the  market economy concept at its Godesberg party congress in 1959,  it never succeeded in proving its competence in the economic  policy field. In November, three large opinion research  institutes found out for the first time that voters think the  SPD is better able to solve economic problems than the Christian  Democratic Union/Christian Social Union [CSU].  <H5>  Eight Economics Ministers in the Federal Laender </H5>   Members of the SPD Executive Board admit that in the contest  of the parties, every party profits from failures of the other  one. In the economic area, the CDU/CSU has so far failed to  submit a convincing concept to cope with acute problems, which  is why the citizens are now staking their hopes on the SPD. The  party is aware that it must provide a substantive basis for this  confidence and present economic experts to put it into practice.  At the Wiesbaden party congress, the delegates agreed that  nothing can be distributed before it has been produced. This is  a decisively new course for the SPD's future economic policy, as  the party executive board stresses.    Scharping now intends to forge the iron as long as it is  hot.  Comparable to the CDU during its time in opposition in the  1970's, a renewal has meanwhile also set in within the SPD  through the federal laender. The Social Democrats supply the  economics ministers in eight of the 16 federal laender -- more  than ever before. Dieter Spoeri from Baden-Wuerttemberg is  considered the most important asset in this respect; he has the  best chance of becoming economics minister in Rudolf Scharping's  shadow cabinet. Spoeri was in Bonn for many years, and gathered  experience in the SPD Bundestag group in the economic and  financial policy area; he is also standing his ground in a grand  coalition with the CDU in Stuttgart. This could, in fact,  qualify him for a top position in Bonn this fall.    But even apart from active politics, a renewal movement is  manifesting itself within the SPD. In circles organized by the  Friedrich Ebert Foundation and elsewhere, leading SPD  politicians meet with scientists, industrial leaders, and  business managers who chat with Rudolf Scharping more and more  often. "The culture of holding talks on important current  political affairs is only now beginning to develop within the  SPD," says a member of the election program commission. Such  talking circles existed when Bjoern Engholm was chancellor  candidate, but they were never more than informal circles. The  idea now is not only to exchange views but also mobilize them  for practical party work, no matter whether economic, financial,  social welfare, foreign, or any other policy areas are concerned.    Former SPD Federal Manager Peter Glotz, who is now a  professor at Munich University, is an important link to the  scientific world. In the "Kochel Circle," young university  teachers who are at least close to the SPD are meeting in  January to give thought provoking impulses in talks with  practical party politicians.   <H5>    In Search of Qualified Candidates </H5>   The party leadership considers it one of the most important  problems to overcome the still existing skepticism about modern  technologies; accepting and guaranteeing them for Germany's  economic base is of outstanding importance. In this respect,  the Transrapid magnetic train and genetic engineering are  mentioned as examples. "In this context, we will not always  pursue the same course as the trade unions," say the program  planners.    The search for qualified candidates for Scharping's election  campaign team includes practicians like Spoeri from the laender  and theoreticians from the scientific area. It is true that the  SPD chairman in 1993 installed a commission to draft the  election campaign program, but this commission will not be  identical to the shadow cabinet. Doubts have even been  expressed of whether Saarland Minister President Oskar  Lafontaine, who is responsible in the commission for economic  and financial policy, will be a member of the shadow team. New  names will emerge, including persons that currently appear as  prominent advisers in talks, to clearly open up the SPD to  business and industry, the middle class, and the scientific  world.    Scharping's circle of advisers also includes active  politicians from the past -- people like Helmut Schmidt, Karl  Schiller, or Manfred Schueler -- to whose advice the new party  chief attaches equally great importance and who have promised  help. Chancellor candidate-designate Scharping is also  inconspicuously practicing his appearance in the international  arena. Shortly before the EC summit in Brussels in December,  the SPD chief met with the chairmen of other European social  democratic parties to discuss problems of economic growth.</p>

			<p><P> December 3, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> TRADE SCHOOL GOES TO COURT TO GET LICENSE  </P> <P> An automotive trade school that opened in Lawndale in October without City  Council approval has asked a Los Angeles Superior Court judge to order the city  to issue it a business license.  </P> <P> The city has refused a business license to Unified Schools of America, saying  it is in violation of the zoning code, which prohibits schools on Hawthorne,  Redondo Beach and Artesia boulevards.  </P> <P> A hearing is scheduled for Feb. 2, Assistant City Atty. Robert Owen said.  </P> <P> The school referred calls to its lawyer, Michael Starler, who could not be  reached Friday.  </P> <P> Owen said the city code prohibits hospitals, trailers and all types of schools  -- including trade schools -- from the three main thoroughfares.  </P> <P> Owen said Unified interprets schools to mean those that are boarding or  residential. "Our interpretation means all schools," he said.  </P> <P> The school is located in the 15000 block of Hawthorne Boulevard.  </P> <P> Unified also charged that the city approved business licenses in 1982 and 1986  for South Bay Automotive Training Center and Barclay College, both on Hawthorne  Boulevard, Owen said.  </P> <P> But Owen said that those schools received permits under a misinterpretation of  city zoning rules and that their cases did not go before the council.  </P> <P> The city told Unified on Oct. 5 that trade schools are indeed prohibited, Owen  said.  </P> <P> A special zoning permit might have solved the dilemma, but Unified officials  decided to open on Oct. 23 without waiting for a compromise, he said.  </P> <P> The city has issued two misdemeanor violations to the school for operating  without a license. The maximum penalties are $1,000 and one year in jail, Owen  said. Alisa Samuels  </P></p>

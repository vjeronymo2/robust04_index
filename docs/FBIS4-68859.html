			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Yevgeniy Saburov, head of the Crimean </F> cabinet, by L. Kononova; place and date not given: "The  Flag-Waving Begins When the Money Comes To Be Shared Out"]    [Text] Some political scientists have evaluated as an  act which is unprecedented in terms of personal courage and  unpredictable in its consequences the consent of Yevgeniy  Saburov (deputy prime minister and minister of economics in the  I. Silayev government and director of the Center for Information  and Social Technology under the present government) to head  Crimea's ministerial cabinet. On 11 March of this year the  Supreme Soviet of the Republic of Crimea confirmed Ye. Saburov  as head of the Crimean Government. What are the first results of  the activity of the new cabinet? How is the political and  economic situation in Crimea developing? This was the subject of  our discussion with Yevgeniy Fedorovich Saburov.    [Kononova] Yevgeniy Fedorovich, what did you find attractive  in Crimean President Yu. Meshkov's offer of the post of head of  the cabinet? Which of the difficulties that you have encountered  in your first month of work have come as a surprise to you?    [Saburov] This invitation attracted me primarily by the  possibility of the realization in practice of the ideas and  principles of the implementation of economic reforms which seem  to me paramount.    In my view, it is extraordinarily important that a  democratic  government pursue its reforms with a view to the populace. That  it not play at being some omniscient guru who has endeavored by  his shamanistic incantations of the Phillips' Curve or  monetarist theory type to evoke the spirit of capitalism on the  sinful land and serve it up to the ignoramuses surrounding him  but implement reforms openly, explaining to people and  coordinating with them his every action.    As far as the difficulties I have encountered are concerned,  there have, I must confess, been no particular surprises.  Everything was, essentially, expected. The only thing I did not  expect was the weakness of the Ukrainian Government. A strong  government that knows what it wants expresses this, as a rule,  and it is possible to come to terms with it on some matters. A  weak government changes its views three times a day, is in a  state of continual mild hysteria, is not sure that it will be  there tomorrow, and does not know how to shore up its positions.  Coming to terms with such a government is absolutely impossible.  Even here, in Russia, I heard from friends negotiating with  various states: The negotiations with Ukraine are the worst  since it is absolutely incomprehensible what they want. The  point is that there never was Ukrainian statehood, it has  emerged for the first time. And this concept itself is at this  time in an absolutely infantile state, no one has the faintest  idea what this means. As a result Ukraine is erecting  prohibitory barriers where they have never been erected by the  Baltic or Western countries, but is at the same time doing some  things such as though there were still a State Planning  Committee and it were possible to go to it with any purchase  orders. Something quite childlike and unstructured shows through  in all things, and because of this things are quite  unpredictable. It is extraordinarily difficult working under  such conditions.    [Kononova] And what is the extent of your independence,  Crimea's independence?    [Saburov] Formally, according to the laws of Ukraine, Crimea  is extraordinarily independent. In fact, however, each action of  Crimea's causes great confusion in the leadership of Ukraine. We  constantly encounter: "If we authorize this for you, what would  our Lvov nationalists say." When you say: "You authorized this a  long time ago, here are the papers," you hear in response: "Yes,  we wrote this, but never thought that this is how it would  actually be."    We, however, will insist on fulfillment of the law on the  delineation of powers between Kiev and Simferopol. This is a  Ukrainian law, the deputies passed it themselves, let it now be  fulfilled.    Of course, there is also ill will, and there are simple  natural enemies of Crimea. There is a part of the government  which would not, generally, have any objections, but is afraid  of the bad example for other oblasts, is afraid of a division of  the state. And this is understandable. There are, finally, yet  others who are simply nobodies and who are worried by just one  thing--that their chair will be knocked from under them. And  these people are the most frightening.    [Kononova] I realize that a comparison is improper,  nonetheless, Valentin Fedorov went to Sakhalin not that long  ago, promising to score inconceivable economic successes there.  We know how it all ended. What have you really managed to  achieve? What kind of mark would you give yourself for the six  weeks of work?    [Saburov] Crimea is not Sakhalin, and I am not Fedorov.  There  can, truly, be absolutely no comparison here.    It is still too early to give any marks. There is  essentially  no government yet even. Yes, I have been confirmed by the  Supreme Soviet of Crimea, but all the rest of the government is  as before, and it is not working, what is more, and a new one  has not been appointed. Only now have the first appointments  been made. And only the upper stratum has been appointed at  that, but everything at the bottom needs to be changed also.  Real work has been slowed considerably. Everything is only just  beginning at this time.    [Kononova] You had an opportunity to form your own team?    [Saburov] I sharply protest this very word "team." Please  understand that the economy and state administration are not a  football. It was those who came to play at state administration  that put this word in circulation. Let them busy themselves with  teams and players. I, on the other hand, am inviting specialists  who are not bound among themselves by any friendly relations and  who have taken no oaths at a soccer match. They are various  sorts of people. Each of which is a specialist in his field.  There is just one principle of personnel  selection--professional. Not party, not friendship, not some  other.    Have I succeeded in enlisting proper professionals? In some  positions, yes, in others, no. The pay is, to be frank,  beggarly, and not everyone will come for this. Those who really  want to show what they are capable of and to test their ideas in  practice will.    [Kononova] Come from where?    [Saburov] From Moscow, Petersburg, Zaporozhye. From various  places.    [Kononova] You do not wish to mention the actual names?    [Saburov] I can cite the names only of those who have  already  been appointed. They are Muscovites, in the main, people with  whom there was from the outset a firm agreement that they would  come. Andrey Vasilyevich Chernyavskiy, minister of economics.  Lyudmila Mikhaylovna Zaytseva, minister of finance. Viktor  Nikolayevich Remeyko, Committee for Foreign Economic Relations.  Anatoliy Romanovich Franchuk, minister for the administration of  state-run enterprises, has already been appointed. He was a  member of the previous government, that is, we are preserving a  certain continuity. This position needs a person who enjoys  authority among the directors.    [Kononova] Yevgeniy Fedorovich, you are constantly saying  that Crimea's economy is strongly tied to that of Russia and  oriented toward Russian sales markets. To what extent are  politics getting in the way of economics? Is the situation  concerning the shareout of the Black Sea Fleet being reflected  in the activity of Crimea in some way?    [Saburov] The Black Sea Fleet situation is a question of who  will get the money from the sale of old ships. There is no  politics here. Dough is being shared out.    [Kononova] Nonetheless, do you have any wishes you would  care  to address to Russian and Ukrainian politicians?    [Saburov] One wish: that they not be so avaricious. On  account of their own greed, both sides have simply paralyzed  themselves. Ukraine is distinguished by particular avarice, of  course. This is the "I wouldn't eat it but I'll take a bite"  from the celebrated story. This is not a story, simply the  truth. "I won't eat it myself nor will I give it to anyone  else." Everyone is afraid of making a miscalculation. They are  arguing about the rent, about who the decommissioned ships  should be turned over to for scrap. This is good money. There is  flag-waving only when money is being shared out.    [Kononova] And what is your view of Nursultan Nazarbayev's  idea of the creation of a Eurasian Union?    [Saburov] Some newspapers have written that Nazarbayev is  reiterating Saburov's idea. I disagree with this assertion  altogether, Nazarbayev's ideas are quite independent. But I  truly am a supporter of the creation of such a union. But for  its creation we all need to be a little more civilized. It  should be remembered that the logic: mine is mine, and yours is  also mine, is no use here. Sharing is essential. After all,  Nazarbayev also initially "fell" on Baykonur, but then realized  that he was not up to it, that maintaining it by himself would  be difficult. This is why such ideas arise: I cannot finance all  these things myself, I need Russia, I need some money. Russia is  somewhat richer.    They say, generally, you know, when it is a question of some  crime or someone's unexpected behavior: "cherchez la femme, look  for the woman." This is the clue. So here, when high politics  begins, there is a different clue: look for the money.  Everything is connected with this. This is, as the ordinary folk  say, an economic issue.    Why was Yuriy Meshkov, the president of Crimea, not admitted  to the negotiations between Ukraine and Russia apropos the  fleet? Crimea has every right to take part in these  negotiations, the fleet's bases are on its territory. No, he was  elbowed aside, suppose he also requested something or other. It  is shameful, dear leaders, availing yourselves of Crimean land  and trying to fool the Crimeans. It was not Meshkov who  disgraced himself in wanting to take part in these negotiations,  it was those who refused to admit him to them who disgraced  themselves, demonstrating to the world their selfish interests.    [Kononova] Yevgeniy Fedorovich, you have dual citizenship,  and you remain the research leader at the center where you have  been working in recent years. Does this mean that you are  unwilling to burn all your bridges?    [Saburov] Yes, I remain a Russian citizen. And if my powers  and knowledge are needed by the Russian Government, I am always  at its disposal. Leadership of the center, search for the  Russian economy's escape from the crisis, and the reforms being  implemented here will remain for me just as urgent as before.    [Kononova] From Crimea our reforms are seen as being....    [Saburov] ...considerably better than from Russia. And  Chernomyrdin is altogether pursuing a pretty good economic  policy at this time, in my view. Pretty good. Technically  competent. He is not, at least, behaving like a bull in a china  shop. He has shown that we need to know how to work, not live by  statements and declarations.    [Kononova] And the final question. What can you tell  Russians  who had been accustomed to spending their summer vacations in  Crimea?    [Saburov] Come. We await you. It is quiet, tranquil,  provincial here. We will do everything necessary. Crimea's  resorts are at your service.    We are now negotiating and organizing in Moscow a Crimea  tourist agency. Here we will tell you everything: what passes  are available, where they are valid, how much they cost, how  they can be purchased. So come without fail.    [Kononova] Thank you.</p>

			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / Arts: Italian Songbook - Symphony Hall To refugees from London's musical life, concerts in Symphony Hall often have a familiar look. The programmes of the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra may be a shining exception, but much of what is programmed in Birmingham crops up around the same time in the capital - the Pittsburgh Symphony played two concerts there last week before coming south, Richter visited with one of his London programmes, James Galway and the Philharmonia will introduce Dave Heath's flute concerto in Birmingham just before its London premiere. Some duplication of that kind is inevitable, the economic logic of concert-giving being as it is. But currently there appears to be more of it than ever, just when in its second year of active life Symphony Hall needs to begin carving out an individual artistic profile. On Wednesday, however, Symphony Hall came up with a celebrity recital all of its own: Felicity Lott, Thomas Allen and Geoffrey Parsons gave Wolf's Italian Songbook to a sizeable and immensely appreciative audience. Not a full house, but a very decent one, demonstrating that although the public for recitals may not yet be as large in Birmingham as it is for orchestral concerts (which it isn't in London either), it is building all the time. Lott's and Allen's performances were beautifully wrought; Parsons' accompaniments began in a slightly unfocused way and gained steadily in point and purpose. It took all the performers, in fact, the first group of songs to settle down and to judge the hall exactly. There was a surprising amount of resonance around the voices, and a consequent emotional distancing until the ear adjusted, and then the two singers' arts seemed exactly complementary. Lott produced some deliciously silvery tones and elegant phrasing - a beautiful sense of shape in 'Wir haben beide' - and kept the coquettish side under strict control; Allen was at his best in the more ebullient songs, sometimes seeming a little laboured when required to sustain a line, especially in the lowest register. Yet such passing moments of uncertainty were invariably followed by a number delivered with perfect judgement; so, after a distinctly uncomfortable 'Heut Nacht erhob ich mich', there was immediately a beautifully proportioned 'Schon streckt' ich aus'. Sense of proportion was the essence of everything about the evening; nothing was out of scale or place, nothing was contrived for cheap effect. Symphony Hall, Birmingham</p>

			<p><P> September 4, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WOOD SPILL AGGRAVATED CYCLE CRASH  </P> <P> Cords of firewood that spilled from a flatbed truck aggravated the fiery crash  that killed five motorcyclists participating in an annual Labor Day weekend  trip in the Sierra Nevada, the California Highway Patrol said Sunday.  </P> <P> Authorities said the load spilled after the driver of the truck crossed into an  oncoming lane and into the path of dozens of bikers.  </P> <P> The driver, his passenger and a sixth motorcyclist were seriously injured in  the crash Saturday on a stretch known as the Mormon Emigrant Trail, a mountain  road about five miles south of Sly Park in El Dorado County, about five miles  east of Jenkinson Reservoir south of U.S. 50.  </P> <P> The back roads of the Sierra Nevada forest land are the scene of an annual trek  that attracts hundreds of cycling enthusiasts from the West.  </P> <P> Friends said the victims of the Saturday crash had been biking to the area for  10 years and were en route to a campsite in the Hope Valley.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 40 Fatalities  </P> <P> Forty-two Labor Day traffic fatalities were reported in California by Sunday  night. Those included that of a highway patrolman who burned to death in San  Francisco when his car was rear-ended by a pickup truck.  </P> <P> Officer Hugo Olazar, 35, died inside the patrol car, which he had parked on the  shoulder of a freeway late Saturday night in order to investigate a crash in  which no one was injured.  </P> <P> The driver of the pickup, Jorge Perez of Daly City, was arrested on suspicion  of felony driving under the influence of alcohol and vehicular manslaughter.  Perez was in stable condition at San Francisco General Hospital.  </P> <P> In the Sierra Nevada incident, investigators were still trying to determine  whether the motorcyclists were hit by the wood or crashed into it, and at which  point the bikes and truck collided.  </P> <P> "Apparently, for some unknown reason, (the driver) crossed over the line and  lost control, causing (a panel) that held the wood to break," CHP spokeswoman  Mary Ann Biggs said. "Wood went all over the roadway. The cycles went down;  then there was a fire at the scene."  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Charges  </P> <P> The truck driver was identified as Daniel DeWater, 24, of Shingle Springs. He  was listed in serious condition at University Medical Center in Sacramento. His  passenger, Wanda Robertson, 32, was reported in very critical condition with  burns over 90% of her body, a spokeswoman said.  </P> <P> No charges have been filed in the incident, officials said Sunday.  </P></p>

			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / People: Hesketh's political weight entices Babcock's board Lord Hesketh, right, who resigned last month as government chief whip in the House of Lords, has joined the board of Babcock International as a non-executive director. The appointment is a further move by Babcock to strengthen its non-executive line-up. In January, Alan Wheatley, who was then chairman of 3i, the venture capital group, joined the board of the engineering contractor, facilities management and materials handling group. While Wheatley was attractive to Babcock for his City contacts, Lord Hesketh will bring additional talents to the Babcock team, said Lord King, chairman. 'Lord Hesketh has extensive national and international experience, politically and commercially, including a period as minister of state in the Department of Trade and Industry where he was highly regarded by those in industry who worked with him,' said Lord King. Engineering ventures are not unknown to Hesketh, who has in the past interested himself in ventures such as Formula One motor racing and an attempt to set up a motorcycle manufacturer. The appointment of Hesketh, 42, comes in the same week as Mr John Parker takes over as deputy chairman and chief executive at Babcock, and Mr Nick Salmon joins as group managing director. A further non-executive appointment is likely.</p>

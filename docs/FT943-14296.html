			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / Aftershock reverberates across the industry: Cuts to cause pain nationwide Yesterday's defence cuts will have a painful and long-lasting impact on employment in several parts of Britain, in spite of efforts to spread redundancies across the services and around the country. In the words of an official involved in planning the exercise: 'There is no downside for defence, but there is a downside in the consequences for individuals.' The number of staff at the Ministry of Defence's head office in London, which has been cut since 1990, will fall faster, with the closure of two buildings - Northumberland House and the Metropole building. The number of employees in London was already scheduled to fall to 5,200 next year from 12,700 in 1990. It is now expected to fall to 3,750 by 1998. The ministry's procurement executive, at present in the throes of wide-ranging cuts, will lose another 500 staff, bringing the number of employees at its new site in Abbey Wood, Bristol, to 9,000 or fewer. The biggest single source of job losses will be reductions in the number of depots and streamlining the provision of spare parts. Air force personnel account for 2,150 of the 6,350 job losses in this category and civilians for another 3,100. The government has not spelt out in detail where these personnel cuts will arise. Some 17 depots of various sizes, ranging from a naval supply establishment at Exeter to an Army engineering park in Stirling, have been earmarked for closure, with the loss of 1,500 jobs. It remains unclear where exactly the remaining redundancies will come. The air force is to make more use of civilians for elementary flying instruction, and two bases used for flying lessons - at Scampton and Finningley - will be closed by 1996-97. Instructions in several other skills, from language training and driving to parachuting, will also rely more heavily on civilians. This would account in part for the 1,500 jobs the RAF is to sacrifice to 'civilianisation' over and above rationalisa-tion of the depot system. Another large category of victims which has yet to be fully explained is provided by the 1,300 civilians who will lose their jobs because of 'rationalisation of science and technology'. All the ministry's non-nuclear science and technology organisations are to be merged in a single executive agency, built on the framework of the existing Defence Research Agency, but also including the Chemical and Biological Defence Establishment at Porton Down. A decision to merge the forces' recruiting offices with the civilian Employment Services Agency will probably cost the jobs of most of the 1,450 people who currently work in military recruiting. Streamlining medical services will cost another 1,000 jobs, spread equally between the services. Around the country there was considerable dismay about the cuts. Mr Bernard Frowd, chief executive of Exeter City Council, said: 'The closure of naval supply establishment is a great blow to Exeter. It means the loss of 290 jobs. 'We have already been told 260 jobs are to go in the Pay and Records Office by 1996. This is 550 jobs in the public sector. Put this together with redundancies in the private sector, British Gas, British Telecom and we are facing job losses of 1,000 over the next couple of years.' He said the latest job losses would push the unemployment rate in the Exeter travel-to- work area - which covers 450,000 people - from 8 per cent into double figures. 'We have received no government relocations and we get no help from the European Union in the form of regional assistance. With the cutbacks in the Plymouth dockyard, Devon has been very hard hit.' In Bristol there was less dismay but only because the immediate job cuts appear to be less than feared. Not all the 900 job cuts in the Procurement Executive will affect its new Abbey Wood headquarters, under construction in north Bristol. There had been fears that the Naval Support Command which has a main site in Bath, employing about 2,500 and supporting thousands more in the area, would be transferred or closed. But all the white paper had to say was: 'We are examining which elements of the headquarters need to be collocated, and the most suitable site in the Bath/Bristol travel to work area.' Mr Darren Parker, the industrial development officer of the Western Development Partnership, said: 'Bristol may seem to have got off lightly, but any job losses are serious, when you consider that in defence manufacturing 7,000 jobs were lost between 1987 and 1993. This is 32 per cent of all jobs in this sector in the area.' As well as the main cuts in defence establishments, the MoD is to close firing ranges at Kirkcudbright, in southern Scotland, Pendine in Dyfed, and Lavington, Wiltshire.</p>

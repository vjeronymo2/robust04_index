			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Survey of France (7): Musical chairs - Privatisation's mixed blessings For the captains of French public sector industry, privatisation can be a mixed blessing. While most are anxious to see their businesses transferred to the private sector, many run the risk of losing their jobs in the process. Mr Edouard Balladur ruled out a wholesale reshuffle in public sector boardrooms when he became prime minister in March 1993, pledging to avoid the witch hunt which has often accompanied changes of administration. But in practice his case by case approach has wrought some significant changes. Of the four companies privatised so far - Elf-Aquitaine, the oil group and France's largest industrial concern, Banque Nationale de Paris, one of France's biggest banks, Union des Assurances de Paris, the biggest insurer and Rhone Poulenc, the chemicals and pharmaceuticals group - it is only the latter which has kept its chairman through the privatisation process. Significant changes have also taken place at the next two groups preparing for auction. Assurances Generales de France and Groupe Bull, the computer manufacturer, have both been given new bosses to prepare them for sale. GAN, the insurance group, and Credit Lyonnais, the bank, are among the companies further down the schedule who have seen their chairmen replaced. Motives for the musical chairs in the private sector vary. Critics point to political motivations, designed to place allies of the centre-right government into positions of enduring financial or industrial authority. Hence the decision to give the top job at UAP to Mr Jacques Friedmann, a confidante of both prime minister Edouard Balladur and Mr Jacques Chirac, head of the gaullist RPR party. The appointment of Mr Philippe Jaffre to head Elf, in place of Mr Loik le Floch-Prigent, also partly reflects the latter's connections to the previous Socialist government. The significance of the appointments is increased by the extensive network of shareholdings between French industrial and financial groups. Thus UAP, one of France's largest institutional investors holds stakes in leading French companies, including Elf and BNP. But political incentives should not be exaggerated. Mr Jean Peyrelevade, who has taken the reins at Credit Lyonnais, earned Socialist credentials while adviser to the government of Mr Pierre Mauroy in the early 1980s. Mr Christian Blanc, appointed last year as chairman of Air France, is close to Mr Michel Rocard, the former leader of France's Socialist Party. Mr Alain Gomez, chairman of Thomson, the electronics group, has kept his seat through a succession of conservative and Socialist administrations. For foreign investors assessing privatisations the reshuffles may seem surprising; many appointees have no previous experience in the industries into which they are parachuted.</p>

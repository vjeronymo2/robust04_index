			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Zeljko Mandic report] </F>   [Text] Since last night Western Slavonija has been cut off  from the rest of the world. During the course of the night  members of the peace forces blocked key positions on the  Okucani-Gradiska upon Sava road with armored personnel carriers  and infantry, preventing pedestrians and vehicles from passing  through, thus bringing the crisis that has emerged near the Sava  bridge to its most extreme stage, one that threatens to become  an open clash between the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] and  the Serbian people of Western Slavonija.    At this moment are 10 UN armored personnel carriers on the  highway, near a place called Dubovacki Nadloznjak. When asked  who ordered the latest show of force, sadly not the only one,  the UNPROFOR members replied that this was the order of the  peacekeepers' supreme command.    Let us recap, UNPROFOR command yesterday issued an ultimatum  to the Krajina police to surrender control of the bridge on the  Sava River that links the republic of Serbian Krajina [RSK] and  the Serbian region of Western Slavonija with the Srpska republic  to the UN forces. This deadline expires today.    The RSK government's ultimatum was that the members of the  Jordanian, Nepalese, and Argentinian Battalions must withdraw  their men and military hardware from the Okucani-Gradiska upon  Sava road within 24 hours and this deadline expired at 1900  [1800 GMT] yesterday.    This latest action of violence by the Blue Berets has only  complicated the already critical situation in Western Slavonija  that has emerged in connection with control over the bridge on  the Sava River linking Stara Gradiska and Gradiska upon Sava,  which threatens to escalate and may result in clashes.    For the time being, we have not observed a concentration of  new troops from other UN Protected Areas [UNPA] in the region,  beside those who regrouped from some parts in UNPA Sector West.  It has been learned, however, that there have been indications  that the existing UNPROFOR troops in the crisis zone of Western  Slavonija could be strengthened by additional forces.</p>

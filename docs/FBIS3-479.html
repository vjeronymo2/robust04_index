This is due to delay tactics being orchestrated by  the Monrovia Group and ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for  Democracy in Liberia]. Reports say in Monrovia, they are trying  to sort out the status of Mr. Thomas Ziah who was reportedly  replaced by ULIMO but rejected by the ULIMO military high  command. Other dignitaries in Monrovia to witness the occasion  include ECOWAS executive secretary, Dr. Edouard Benjamin; the  Ivorian foreign minister, Amara Essy; Nigeria's foreign  minister, Babagana Kingibe; and General Arnold Quainoo,  representing the Ghanaian Government. The representatives of  various international and local organizations are also in  Monrovia for the ceremony.    At the same time, news say the NPRA [National Patriotic  Reconstruction Assembly] delegation to the Monrovia inauguration  of Liberia's collective leadership, headed by Vice President  Enoch Dogolee, has been blocked in Kakata from attending the  seating of the transitional government. The NPRA Government's  delegation was being escorted by the UN Observer Mission. This  move by ULIMO in Kakata comes in the wake of assurances by  UNOMIL [United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia] and ECOMOG  [Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring  Group] that all is set for the seating of the LNTG unhindered.    Earlier, ULIMO military commander, General Roosevelt  Johnson,  made a trip to Kakata at which time he gave an assurance that  his men will strictly adhere to the free movement of people, but  this has since been violated by his soldiers. Similar  undisciplined behavior by ULIMO fighters occurred during the  opening of the road when the US ambassador and several other  dignitaries were stopped from traveling through Kakata. ULIMO  has been openly defying the mandate of the UN and ECOMOG by  seizing and looting UN relief convoys, bringing in supplies to  Greater Liberia.    The NPRA Government is yet to react to the stopping of its  delegation by ULIMO to attend the inaugural ceremony. The  ECOMOG high command has also not intervened to get the NPRA  Government's delegation through Kakata despite its assurances  that all is set for the seating of the LNTG today.</p>

			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Personal pensions under fire PENSIONS NEED a radical overhaul, including the introduction of a new national personal pension scheme and sharp increases in the basic state payout, says the Institute for Public Policy Research. The institute, a left-of-centre think tank, says in a review of UK state and private pension provision published today that the new personal pension scheme should invest in a new class of government bond. It says that the government's increasing reliance on personal pensions for retirement provision is badly misguided. The cost of operating a personal pension is about four times that of state schemes and offers a reasonable level of benefit to a very limited percentage of people, it says. Personal pensions are not practical for those earning less than Pounds 8,000 to Pounds 9,000 a year because they cannot contribute enough to make the contract worthwhile, it says. The average salary for those without an occupational pension scheme, for whom personal pensions are advised, is about Pounds 8,750. The institute says the government should substantially increase state pension benefit instead of relying on personal pensions. 'The higher basic pension would be set, as a minimum, at the income support level for pensioners. An allowance for housing costs would be paid in addition.' It says the increases could be financed by restoration of the Treasury supplement to the National Insurance Fund. The cost would be covered in part by the abolition of the income tax age allowance. Necessary tax increases among the working population could be phased in sufficiently slowly to have minimal effects on take-home pay, it says. The institute urges an overhaul of the state earnings-related pension scheme, with the government creating a new national personal pension scheme to be funded by member contributions - which would in effect be long-term savings. It proposes the investment of these contributions in a new government security - 'national insurance pension bonds' - with the capital value linked to an index of national average earnings. Interest would be in line with the assumptions underlying calculations of tax incentives offered to those who contract out of this type of provision. The institute is urging an overhaul of occupational pensions regulation which would include rules protecting the benefits of those who switch jobs. There should be industry schemes for those whose employer makes no pension provision, it says. Better Pensions for All, Bryn Davies. Institute for Public Policy Research, 30-32 Southampton Street, London WC2E 7RA. Pounds 7.50.</p>

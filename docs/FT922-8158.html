			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Iran pulls out the biggest plum from Afghan pie: Tehran has won influence via the Persian speakers who now control Kabul AS THE dust begins to settle over Kabul, the foreign players are counting their takings. Many countries have stuck their fingers into the Afghan pie during 14 years of civil war, but none has emerged with as much to show as Iran. Iran backed Afghanistan's Shia parties throughout the Afghan civil war, hosting the leaders and giving shelter to 1m refugees. It supplied arms to Shia mujahideen groups, vying with Sunni Saudi Arabia and Pakistan for control of the jihad (holy war). However, with the fall of the Soviet-backed regime last month, Tehran's primary aim in Afghanistan shifted. It turned from promoting Shia Islamic revolution to the promotion of Persian culture. As Afghanistan began to splinter along ethnic lines in the post-communist vacuum Iran placed its weight firmly behind the Persian-speaking Tajiks and Uzbeks who control Kabul. 'The Iranians support (defence minister Ahmad Shah) Masood,' said a moderate Afghan leader in Peshawar. 'They think Masood will take care of their interests because he speaks their language.' Mr Masood is not the only Persian speaker in Kabul. The ex-government militia controlling Kabul's streets are Persian-speaking Uzbeks. General Asif Dilawar, appointed commander-in-chief of the Afghan army forces by Mr Masood last week, is also a Persian speaker. Furthermore, Tehran hosted a meeting this year with Afghan president-designate Burhanuddin Rabbani and representatives from Tajikistan to promote Persian-based cultural links between Iran, Afghanistan and Tajikistan. With most power centres in Kabul filled by Persian speakers, the Iranians are sitting pretty. 'I'd like to say we've done very well out of the last 14 years,' said Iran's consul in Peshawar, Mr Hamid Reza Sherkhodai. A Persian-influenced government in Kabul is indeed a rare achievement. Afghanistan has been ruled almost continuously by the majority Pushtun tribe, who are spread throughout eastern Afghanistan and western Pakistan. In fact, only once has a non-Pushtun controlled Kabul, when Tajik waterseller Bacha Siqa ruled for six months in the 1920s. To bolster the new government in Kabul, the Iranians sent fuel and food to Afghanistan's western provinces. A religious delegation brought gifts and aid to Herat. Iran is also trying to open a supply route all the way to Kabul. The Iranians bring to the Afghans not only aid but a cultural influence. 'We have certain cultural roots with these people,' said Mr Sherkhodai. 'We have a common language and common religion.' Iran is encouraging these links, offering to fund academic study of Persian literature and celebrating the ancient Zoroastrian New Year in common with the Afghans. 'Iran is offering the Afghans a copy of Ferdowsi (a Persian poet) with every sack of wheat it sends,' said one western observer. Of course, Tehran has not abandoned the Shia parties entirely. It continues to back the Shia Hazara tribe in Afghanistan and provides moral and financial support to Shia mujahideen group Hezbe Wahdat and pressure groups such as the TNFJ in Pakistan. But Iranian hardliners elected in the fiery last days of Iran's war with Iraq who might have forced these groups higher up the Iranian agenda have found their influence waning in Tehran. President Rafsanjani's reformist supporters have just won a landslide victory in parliamentary elections characterised by an electorate more concerned with economic well-being than ideological purity. At the heart of Iran's acceptance of the status quo in Kabul is a fear of the alternative. Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, radical Pushtun and main recipient of Pakistani and US military assistance for the last decade, leads an informal coalition of parties opposed to the Kabul government. As the most powerful leader outside Kabul, Mr Hekmatyar would stand to take over the mantle if Kabul's new government fell. Tehran fears that Mr Hekmatyar, as a Pushtun, would favour Pakistani interests over Iran's. Iran is embroiled in tough competition with Pakistan and Turkey over the re-opening of trade routes with land-locked central Asia. Afghanistan borders three central Asian states of the former Soviet Union so any significant trade depends on stability in Kabul. In April, Iran announced the start of a new railway line from Turkmenistan to Iran's southern coast. It agreed to provide oil pipelines from Tajikistan and Turkmenistan through to Turkey to the west. And this week it joined an agreement to re-open the east-west silk road across Asia. Pakistan, meanwhile, is planning an Export Processing Zone in its North West Frontier Province bordering Afghanistan, providing 50 per cent relief on rail freight, duty-free import of raw material and reduced duty on exports. Iran's influence on Kabul is already bearing fruit. Iranian official sources said Kabul had this week ordered a significant supply of oil from Iran. A quick settlement in Kabul would also rid Iran of the financial burden of supporting refugees. With its inflation conservatively estimated at 30 per cent, and imports nearing an all-time high at Dollars 17bn (Pounds 9.6bn), Iran badly needs to patch its economy together.

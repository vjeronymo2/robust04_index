Individuals that use a telecommunications device for the deaf (TDD) may call the Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) at 1&hyph;800&hyph;877&hyph;8339 between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m., Eastern time, Monday through Friday.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  These proposed regulations implement amended section 484(d) of the HEA, Public Law 102&hyph;325. As amended, section 484(d) provides that a student who does not have a high school diploma or its recognized equivalent is eligible for Title IV, HEA program funds only if_  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;The student takes an independently administered examination and achieves a score specified by the Secretary, demonstrating that the student has the ability to benefit from the education or training being offered; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The student is determined to have the ability to benefit from the education or training being offered in accordance with a ``process'' prescribed by the State in which the institution the student is attending is located and that has been approved by the Secretary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These proposed regulations were subject to a regulatory negotiation process set forth in section 492 of the HEA. Under that process, the Secretary convened four regional meetings to obtain public involvement in the development of these proposed regulations. These meetings were held in San Francisco, Atlanta, New York, and Kansas City. At these meetings, the Secretary provided attendees with a list of issues that needed to be addressed in these proposed regulations. A summary of the responses of the attendees is contained in Appendix A to these proposed regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Groups that attended the regional meetings nominated individuals to participate in regulatory negotiations. The Secretary selected regulation negotiators from the names nominated and chose negotiators to reflect all the groups that participate in the Title IV, HEA programs, such as students, student financial aid administrators, and various types of eligible institutions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with section 492(b) of the HEA, the Secretary prepared draft proposed regulations and negotiated provisions of the draft with the negotiators. Two negotiating sessions were held: one in April 1993 and one in June 1993. Generally, consensus was not reached on any issues in these regulations, consensus being defined as unanimity among all negotiators.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The provision of postsecondary education and training programs to students who have neither a high school diploma nor its recognized equivalent has broader dimensions than those covered under section 484(d) of the HEA and this proposed regulation. Within the systemic education reforms of the Goals 2000 initiative and current efforts to build an effective school-to-work transition system, the Secretary is investigating long-term strategies to address problems of opportunity and quality education for this population, and invites public comment and suggestions concerning those strategies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary also invites comment on an alternative approach to implementing the changes in section 484(d) of the HEA under the 1992 Amendments (PL 102&hyph;325) that would link the ability-to-benefit (ATB) testing system to State education practice and policy under the ``Goals 2000: Educate America Act'' (PL 103&hyph;227). If adopted by the Secretary, under this alternative, the Secretary would publish in the final rule a procedure with the following components:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _By a date to be specified, each State would be asked to inform the Secretary of the test (or tests) which the State has determined best reflect the education goals and standards for high school graduates in its public education system. By the same specified date, each State would also set the passing score or scores on those tests, and provide the Secretary with a justification for the passing score in light of the goals and standards for its public high school graduates. These tests and passing scores would then become the only allowable ATB tests and passing scores for all postsecondary institutions located and licensed in the State.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _The Secretary could not disapprove the State's determination except in circumstances in which the selection of tests and determination of passing scores was documented as inappropriate. The State could replace a disapproved test or reset a passing score under the same terms as above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _By the same specified date, each State would also submit to the Secretary a plan to ensure independent, fair and secure administration of the selected tests within its borders, including any provisions the State may deem appropriate for testing students with disabilities and students of limited English proficiency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _The State would inform all institutions licensed by the State and certified and made eligible for Title IV funds by the Secretary of the approved tests, passing scores, administrative procedures, and special provisions, and indicate how it intends to enforce its decisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Any State that, by the date specified, chooses not to select tests, determine passing scores, and submit plans for the other aspects of ensuring independent, fair and secure administration of its ability to benefit testing program, must notify the Secretary of that choice. By not participating, the State would thereby be determining that students applying for Title IV (HEA) financial aid to attend a school within the State (1) would have to pass a test determined by the Secretary, according to the procedures specified in this NPRM, or (2) participate in an approved ``State process'' as specified in PL 102&hyph;325 and as described in this NPRM.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Man in the News: Roll over, reformers - Viktor Chernomyrdin The acclaimed victor of Russia's elections was the ultra-nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky; the less obvious one was Mr Viktor Stepanovich Chernomyrdin. With the finesse of an astute politician, he had declared himself above politics throughout much of the campaign - holidaying, then taking medical treatment. The result, which gave no political force a dominant position in parliament, was a perfect outcome for him. He continued to hold the prime ministerial post because he stood not for any one of the many different policies trumpeted by the various parties but for a little of each of them. Unhappy and stumbling when first named prime minister in December 1992, and saddled with radical economists whom he found at best uncongenial, he is now his own man with his own cabinet. If he makes - or can claim  - a success over the next year (which many think impossible), he will be in a position to challenge for the presidency. He has shown not a scintilla of ambition for the post: he is not the kind of politician who would. Mr Chernomyrdin was one of the most successful Soviet enterprise managers, rising to the top of the state gas monopoly in 1985, later revamped into a state concern called Gasprom. He controlled what was, after oil, the country's second-largest export earner, on whose gas flow large parts of central and eastern Europe, especially Germany, depended. In May 1992, he was appointed deputy prime minister responsible for energy, when President Boris Yeltsin decided to dilute his radical cabinet with a few old-style industrialists. When, in December of that year, the pressure on the reformist Mr Yegor Gaidar (then acting prime minister) to resign became irresistible, President Yeltsin cast about for a successor. Mr Chernomyrdin emerged as a favourite, leaping over more obvious candidates. His reputation for decisiveness, for hard work and for belonging to no particular faction propelled him into a seat for which, patently, he was unprepared. His first appearance was shambolic. He called for a revival of heavy industry and appeared to approve a decree re-imposing state controls on some prices. He then renounced both. Then, a month after his appointment, he made a speech at an international conference which was a model of reformist rhetoric. The radicals, even shorn of Mr Gaidar (then presidential economic adviser), still appeared to have their hands on the economic levers - the more so since Mr Boris Fyodorov was brought back from the World Bank to be a deputy premier in charge of finance. Throughout 1993, when politics were dominated by the enervating battle between parliament and president, Mr Chernomyrdin tacked cautiously. An unguarded comment before the April referendum to measure support for the president - to the effect that Mr Anatoly Chubais' privatisation campaign was akin to Stalin's collectivisation of the peasants - was not repeated. After Mr Yeltsin's victory in the referendum, he adopted the tactic of conspicuous loyalty. The suppression of parliament demonstrated how his power had increased. When Mr Yeltsin announced that he was banning the assembly, it suddenly became a matter of interest what his prime minister would say. His solid support, coming after a not-too-indecent pause, was a reassurance. He had become an independent player. As the reformers sought to build on the president's success in banishing his foes, Mr Chernomyrdin faded a little into the background. Yet he managed still to protect Mr Viktor Gerashchenko, the central bank chairman, from being fired, and always to keep a lifeline of credits to the industrial enterprises. While the election result traumatised the radicals, he, by contrast, calmly began a round of talks with the leaders of all the parties represented in the new parliament. He also gave an interview to Trud, the centrist daily, promising an end to economic shock therapy, and began to bargain for a new cabinet. Mr Chernomyrdin must have been pleased at Mr Gaidar's surrender; Mr Fyodorov was a tougher nut, refusing to leave. This week the latter sent a stinging letter to Mr Yeltsin, saying the cabinet was sliding back towards communist methods and demanding a commitment to reform, his way. Mr Chernomyrdin ventured neither apology nor commitment, but did offer him a downgraded job as finance minister. After a few days of stand-off, Mr Fyodorov resigned. What Mr Chernomyrdin will do with his victory will decide the future of the Russian economy. Few seriously accuse him of being a reactionary, but fewer still would suggest he has metamorphosed into a radical. He gives no indication of the extent to which he has imbibed the need to retain - or to put in place - the totems of the radicals: in particular a tight credit policy and rapid privatisation. The best bet is that he will continue to regard inflation as the first enemy and will try to tame it. But he will be a periodic victim to the demands of the industrial lobby and may be unable to tread what Mr Alexander Shokhin, the new economy minister, called 'the thin corridor between hyperinflation and industrial collapse'. That corridor grows thinner by the day. The fall of the rouble, temporarily stemmed by central bank intervention, showed a market fearful of the loss of those who had striven to limit credit flows; a market with little faith in either Mr Chernomyrdin or Mr Gerashchenko to continue the struggle. Decisions such as that to merge the economic systems of Belarus and Russia (in which Mr Chernomyrdin had a personal role), and to spend Dollars 500m on a parliament building, are signs of a new confident carelessness with the monetary system. It is not hard to construct a vision of a man pulled further and further into stopgap, anti-inflationary measures - a man forced, as he would see it, to reimpose the price, wage and planning controls to which his instincts would probably guide him. There is a chance that Mr Chernomyrdin will surprise us, but it is as narrow as the corridor down which he must now walk.</p>

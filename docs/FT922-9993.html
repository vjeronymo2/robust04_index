			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / People: Inscrutability extends to Hong Kong Spotting who is on the fast track at the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation needs the same sort of skills as a sinologist these days. Unlike most modern financial institutions Honkers and Shankers does not reveal the ages of its executive team, let alone their first names, in its annual report. So it is impossible to get a feel for who is over the hill, on the way up, and what to call them if one ever bumps into them at a cocktail party. Now that it has even stopped publishing the names and responsibilities of its general managers in its annual report, it is well nigh impossible for a passing headhunter to spot likely talent lurking just below the boardroom table. Occasionally students of form get a lucky break. The Midland offer document, for example, broke with tradition and let it be known that Messrs J E Strickland and F J French are both called John. They sound like they could be important but the bank is hazy about their ages, so it is hard to tell whether they are about to be put out to grass or are chairman material. K R Whitson, 49, is another name to conjure with. Having joined the bank in 1961, he first came to prominence in the City when he was made chief executive of the group's UK business in November 1987. In 1990 he was posted to the US to be executive director of the group's troubled Marine Midland operation and now he is handing over his Marine hat to Canadian Jim Cleave. Does this mean that Whitson is being promoted? The bank is as inscrutable as ever. All it will say is that Whitson's next appointment will be announced in 'due course'. Since he has done his statutory 30 years he could retire if he wanted to, but then that applies to most of the top executives. The next main board appointments will be worth watching since they could give a clue as to who will take over from chairman Willie Purves, 60, who is already long past the chairman's normal retirement age. If Whitson is leapfrogged by T W O'Brien, 44, then it is a sure sign that the current chief executive of the group's UK operations is a man to watch.</p>

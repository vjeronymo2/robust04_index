			<p><P> January 27, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 707, AGING BUT RELIABLE, STILL FLIES PRESIDENT  </P> <P> The Boeing 707 that crashed here Thursday night was a 23-year-old plane with  far fewer flight hours than other jets of its vintage.  </P> <P> The Avianca plane was the 592nd model to come off the 707 assembly line at  Boeing. It was delivered to Pan American World Airways on June 30, 1967, and  sold to Avianca on Feb. 25, 1977.  </P> <P> The doomed plane had flown 61,193 flight hours and landed 22,764 times. Most  707s of that vintage have averaged 80,000 flight hours.  </P> <P> Boeing said Friday that it did not know if the plane had recent problems. The  National Transportation Safety Board is expected to investigate that question,  and Boeing sent a safety investigator, a pilot and a fuel systems expert to  help the NTSB in its overall probe.  </P> <P> The Colombian radio network RCN reported that the plane had been plagued by  mechanical problems recently, having been sent to the maintenance shop 37 times  in the past four months. The radio did not say what the maintenance was for.  </P> <P> Known as a reliable and durable workhorse, the 707 is nevertheless no longer  flying passengers in this country with two notable exceptions: Air Force One,  the President's plane, and its backup are 707s.  </P> <P> The 707 fell into disuse in the United States largely because of noise  restrictions and the introduction of more fuel efficient and wider-bodied  aircraft. Many 707s still fly elsewhere.  </P> <P> "It's a real solidly built airplane," said Jack B. Feir, a New York aviation  consultant who specializes in aircraft appraisals. "It's a tank."  </P> <P> The 707 was Boeing's first commercial jetliner. The last commercial version of  the plane was built in 1978 but the company is still making military versions  of it.  </P> <P> Avianca, the national airline of Colombia, which flies to Miami, New York and  once a week to Los Angeles, is the oldest airline in the Western Hemisphere.  Nevertheless, some of its pilots have acquired the reputation of not always  being as conservative as their counterparts in the United States and Europe.  </P> <P> "They are cowboys," said one source in the aviation industry who declined to be  identified. "They will fly in mountains in bad weather. They do things more  conservative American pilots wouldn't do."  </P> <P> An Avianca Boeing 747 crashed on approach to Madrid, Spain, in November of  1983, killing 181. Eleven survived.  </P> <P> In November of 1989 an Avianca 727 crashed near Bogota, killing all 107 aboard.  Investigators confirmed that a bomb in the passenger cabin consisting of  plastic explosive was the cause. A telephone caller claimed that a group of  drug lords called "the Extraditables" planted the bomb in order to kill five  police informants it said were on board.  </P> <P> Researcher Lisa Romaine contributed to this story.  </P></p>

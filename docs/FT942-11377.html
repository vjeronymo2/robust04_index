			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / ANC heads for crucial two-thirds majority South Africa's Independent Electoral Commission is expected to release final results today confirming the overwhelming victory of Mr Nelson Mandela's African National Congress in last week's all-race poll. Any further delay in the count could upset the timetable leading to Mr Mandela's inauguration as president next Tuesday. Leaders of all parties regard it as unthinkable that the event, expected to be attended by more than 40 world leaders, should be postponed. The latest official count, based on figures made available last night, showed the ANC edging further towards a two-thirds majority in the 400-member National Assembly that would give it the power to draft the country's constitution. The commission's latest batch of figures, encompassing more than 70 per cent of the estimated electorate, showed the ANC consolidating its lead with 65.4 per cent of the vote. The National party, led by outgoing president F. W. de Klerk, was second at 20.3 per cent and the Inkatha Freedom party third on 7.9 per cent. The assembly is required to draw up a new constitution which will be the basis of the next election, due to take place by 1999. The principles of this constitution, however, have already been agreed in the course of multi-party negotiations which ended late last year. The strong support for the ANC will also reinforce its dominance of the cabinet, where posts will be allocated according to the parties' electoral showing. Mr Mandela has hinted, however, that he will offer ministries to the conservative Freedom Front, the liberal Democratic party and the radical black Pan Africanist Congress, although none is likely to achieve the minimum 5 per cent of the vote that cabinet representation requires. The Freedom Front's share stood last night at 2.2 per cent while the DP had 1.6 per cent and the PAC 1.3 per cent. This was based on 16.4m votes counted out of an estimated turnout of close to 23m. The decision on Wednesday by Mr Justice Johann Kriegler, head of the IEC, to allow the parties to interpret disputed ballots according to a complicated weighting system attracted vigorous criticism yesterday. In a front-page editorial, Business Day newspaper accused Mr Justice Kriegler of 'dissembling' and hiding 'the full truth of the political deals he has helped cut with major parties from the millions of voters whose commitment and hope gave the election its value.' Jittery markets dropped further on the lack of new information. The financial rand, the main barometer of international investor confidence, shed 6 cents in London to close at R4.79 to the dollar, a decline of nearly 5 per cent over the past two days. The stock market's overall index finished 22 points down at 5,231.</p>

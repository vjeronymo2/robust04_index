			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / Leading Article: Politics of population After 10 days in the Cairo heat, the United Nations conference on population and development has produced a remarkable document. More than 150 countries of widely differing cultures and religions have given their support to a 20-year plan aimed at curbing the world's population growth. The programme, which urges countries to give universal access to family planning and reproductive healthcare, may cost an estimated Dollars 17bn a year by the end of the decade. But the more ambitious element of the document is its statement that individuals, particularly women, have the right to control the number and timing of their children. It urges that women's status worldwide should be enhanced to give them the education and freedom to make those choices. In a radical departure from previous UN conferences, it sees a broad agenda of social development, of which contraception is just one part, as the best way to tackle population growth. Watching governments wrestle to agree on some of the most tortuous language in the UN lexicon, there is reason to ask whether the exercise was worthwhile. The policy statement is not binding, and critics have asked whether the 'reproductive rights' it bestows on every person have any meaning, given that there is no arena in which they can be enforced. Moreover, in many countries which gave their support to the text, people enjoy only limited political and legal rights. However, there is cause for hope that governments will embrace much of the Cairo text. As the population 'clock' in the conference hall's centre reminded them, by registering more than one birth a second, it is in their own interest to help people limit the size of their families. There are also strong arguments that Cairo was right to persist with the more ambitious parts of its agenda. The final document is, like the UN's statement of human rights, an attempt to draw a common thread of agreement between states of widely differing cultures. Mrs Nafis Sadik, director of the UN population fund, who chaired the conference, deserves credit for her determination to spin that thread through one of the most sensitive areas of politics and human relationships. The price of such agreements is hypocrisy: governments may well have signed something they have no intention of enforcing. One delegate from western Europe commented that, in ignoring the reality of countries' records on family planning, 'it's been like ignoring an elephant in your bedroom'. But the Cairo agreement at least provides a standard against which their actions can be judged. That agreement might have been still broader, or reached more quickly, without the Vatican. In focusing on abortion - although the text mentions the issue only as a threat to women's health - it stalled days of debate, and may also have damaged public support for the Cairo policies. The Vatican attended Cairo because of its status as permanent observer at the UN. But its role appeared anomalous, as the only religion represented, and as the only state with a birth rate of zero. In the forthcoming UN conferences on social development and on women, governments should consider how far they want to accommodate Rome in the formidable but worthwhile task of reaching consensus on these highly contentious questions.</p>

			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Business Travel: Virgin name change Virgin Atlantic is renaming its full-fare economy Mid Class cabin Premium Economy. An increasing number of passengers were becoming confused and angry that they were not receiving a comprehensive business-class service when flying Mid Class, writes Paul Betts. The airline says research has revealed that some passengers and travel agents considered Mid Class as the airline's business cabin, rather than a superior product for passengers paying a full economy fare. This confusion has left passengers feeling they are not getting their money's worth. They have compared Mid Class unfavourably with business-class services of other carriers, says Virgin. 'By giving it an economy tag, we are signalling exactly what it is - a superior economy product,' says Ruth Blakemore, Virgin Atlantic's marketing manager. Mid Class, launched two years ago, offers separate check-in and cabin, more seat room, free drinks and newspapers.</p>

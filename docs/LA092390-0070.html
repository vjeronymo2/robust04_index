			<p><P> September 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FORGET INTERSERVICE STRIFE, MILITARY NOW STRESSES 'JOINTNESS';  </P> <P> MILITARY: SPEAKING OUT OF TURN, GEN. DUGAN BROKE SEVERAL RULES OF COMMAND --  AND OVER-EMPHASIZING THE AIR FORCE ROLE DID NOT HELP.  </P> <P> About once every 40 years, the U.S. public is titillated by the spectacle of a  military chief being fired by his civilian superiors. The last time was part of  the "Fancy Dan" period of the Revolt of the Admirals and a final limit to Gen.  Omar Bradley's tolerance -- when Adm. Louis E. Denfeld was fired in 1949. And  now it has happened again. Poor Michael J. Dugan left his post as Air Force  chief of staff before he had time to move into quarters. When he was dismissed  by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney on Monday for displaying poor judgment, Dugan  had been on the job fewer than three months.  </P> <P> Some say: "What he said about launching a massive air strike against Saddam  Hussein made sense, and the general scheme was not denied" -- and that may be  true. But privates can say things generals cannot. And generals in the field  may -- with a little more professional hazard -- say things that chiefs of  staff cannot. It is also true that Dugan had been exhorting his troops to be  more open with the press, and that philosophy may have contributed to his  outspoken talk -- so outspoken, according to one account, that the interviewer  asked him whether he really should be saying those things.  </P> <P> One is reminded of the famous document in the aftermath of World War II that  purported to be an interview with the famous ace, Lt. Roger Rudder. The three  persons involved in this fictitious paper are the interviewer, Rudder and the  poor public information officer. He desperately tried to salvage the interview,  beginning each comment with "What the lieutenant really meant to say was . . ."  (SAMPLE: "Lieutenant, what do you think of your equipment?" "If I ever catch  the SOB who welded his lunch bucket onto my tail section, I am going to break  his butt!" "What the lieutenant meant to say was that he is filled with  admiration for the superb workmanship of our dedicated work force.")  </P> <P> But there is more to this affair than the natural enthusiasm of a new leader.  First there is the real problem of continuing to have Arab forces arrayed on  the U.N. side against the forces of Saddam Hussein. Any split in the Moslem  world is delicate and needs to be nurtured. And Arabs are not Jeffersonian  Democrats who speak another language; they spring from a wholly different  culture. Thus the last thing needed in this build-up stage is some direct  reminder that the United States also has ties to Israel. Just as U.S. strategy  against Iraq needs to be coordinated at the highest level, so do any gratuitous  comments about a role for Israel.  </P> <P> The second factor has to do with targeting the person and family of Hussein --  including his mistress. Washington may well wish him gone from this earth, and  that departure might be a blessing. But there is an executive order on that  subject, prohibiting the slaying of a head of state. That also presents certain  anomalies for the soldier on the ground. ("Son, I want you to go into that  building and capture that Saddam feller. I know there is shooting going on, but  for God's sake do not kill him. If you do, I have to send you to the slammer  for 40 years.")  </P> <P> A third factor lies in the role of a chief of service. In the simpler days of  World War II, the law specified certain duties for the chief of service. In the  aftermath of the creation of the Defense Department, Title 10 of the U.S. Code  was changed in the late 1950s. From that point on, the law can be summarized as  saying that the secretary of a service does what the secretary of defense tells  him to and a uniformed chief of that service does what his secretary tells him  to do.  </P> <P> However, part of the person of a chief of service is a piece of that corporate  entity, the Joint Chiefs of Staff. I was once privileged to hear that saintly  man, Gen. Harold K. Johnson, inform a civilian official of exactly that fact.  He said the secretary (in this case Army) had no authority to direct what he,  as a piece of the JCS, would say in that body. Now the law has been tightened  again, to provide further authority for the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of  Staff to speak for that body. There is little evidence that Gen. Colin L.  Powell, head of the joint chiefs, knew of or approved Dugan's remarks.  </P> <P> As a fourth point, with the changes in the law, general strategy is the  province of the joint chiefs -- and the service chiefs defer to their chairman  for public expressions of such strategy. Detailed strategy and operational  matters are the province of the commanders appointed by the authorities -- not  the service chiefs.  </P> <P> So one must be very careful in a time of dwindling budgets not to accept the  protestations of those folk, usually retired, who claim that one service can do  everything. For some time it has been national policy that combat forces be put  together out of building blocks provided by those services whose forces and  equipment are best able to play that role. While there must be some redundancy  in war, there are very practical limits to such redundancy.  </P> <P> The Army is the most keenly aware of that fact -- for it must rely on others to  get it there, by sea or air. Yet the mundane logistics tasks are often given a  secondary role to play when competing for scarce resources against the  glamorous facets of war -- fighting. For some time we have been putting  together forces for particular missions. Army helicopters have been flying in  the Navy Task Forces in the gulf; they are trained and equipped to do what Navy  or Marine helicopters cannot.  </P> <P> Spare Army tanks are stocked in unit sets in Germany to make it easy for the  air transport of troops to use them on the central front of the North Atlantic  Treaty Organization. While that front is changing, some of those tanks may  become more generally available later -- Marine tanks floating near Diego  Garcia could be called for early arrival in Saudi Arabia together with troopers  from the 82nd Airborne Division. This is the way the system works: Task forces  are put together from those pieces best suited to the mission and best  available in distance.  </P> <P> While this has been true for some time, the press makes it difficult when it  reports such operations as evidence that everyone is being given a piece of the  action because of service rivalry. It is the way things are organized now.  </P> <P> There was an element in Dugan's reported comments that indicated the Air Force  can do it all by itself. The Air Force may well play a primary role if it comes  to combat in these circumstances -- but no one service will do it all. That is  not the way the cookie crumbles in today's world. We need to remember this  every time some retired Marine general says the Marines can do it all by  themselves. Or some retired admiral says only the Navy is needed. Or some  active-duty general says only the Air Force.  </P> <P> There is one final facet of this problem that engenders sympathy for Dugan. Any  military leader must be a cheerleader. He has to express unlimited confidence  that his team will win, and he has to express this where his troops will see or  hear it. It is difficult for a naturally enthusiastic individual to keep in  mind that the cheerleader side must be modified by the realities of other parts  of his job.  </P> <P> For some years now there has been a course at the National Defense University  to train new generals and admirals in the basics of joint and allied operations  -- a course in "jointness." As a result of congressional interest, almost all  new flag officers go through this course. It is held four times a year. As  these officers work their way up the chain, we can expect to see fewer public  protestations that any one service can do everything itself -- and fewer  mishaps of this sort.  </P></p>

			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Books: A many-sided man of letters - An admirable new edition of Johnson's correspondence THE LETTERS OF SAMUEL JOHNSON: VOLUMES I-III, 1731-1781 edited by Bruce Redford Oxford Pounds 25 each, c400 pages THE JOURNALS OF JAMES BOSWELL 1761-1795 selected and introduced by John Wain Heinemann Pounds 20, 412 pages THE POPULAR conception of Dr Johnson, derived from Boswell's Life, as the great fulminator and layer down of the law, becomes modified when his letters are read consecutively. A new edition of his correspondence, the most complete so far, brings out the many-sidedness of the man: Johnson the loving husband with a sick wife, replaced soon by Johnson the widower who is in spite of his own grief a constant support and morale-raiser for his friends and fellow authors, men and women. Then there is Johnson the freelance who is his own literary agent; and Johnson the dedicated classical scholar, part of an erudite network of friends and colleagues regularly exchanging information. All these Johnsons come through more powerfully than ever before. Many of the letters are well-known - not just from previous scholarly editions, mainly the one in 1952 from Oxford by RW Chapman - but also from Boswell and from being printed in full in books such as John Wain's Johnson on Johnson where the texts of letters are taken from the Chapman edition. 'Chapman', said Wain, 'worked on Johnson's letters from 1919 to 1952; what he did not know about them, I for one am content to go on not knowing.' Not everyone, though, was so content with the Chapman edition. The American Johnson specialist Bruce Redford, professor of English at the University of Chicago, has been hard at work with his students for many years on an entirely new edition of the letters of Johnson and now we have before us the bulk of it in three volumes. This is called the Hyde Edition: it derives from the Hyde Collection partly formed by Mary Hyde Eccles (Lady Eccles) without whose scholarly enthusiasm this new edition would not have been possible. The first volume begins in 1731: Johnson, recently down from Oxford without a degree, writes from Lichfield to Edward Cave, editor of The Gentleman's Magazine, trying to interest him in taking some work. By the third volume Johnson has become a famous man, having made his name with the appearance of his Dictionary in 1757. He writes in 1781 to his friend Mrs Thrale, the brewer's widow, assuring her that his affection for her is not diminished. Before his death three years later he will break with her completely. Redford found Chapman's edition inadequate in several respects. In his three volumes Chapman printed, all told, 1,515 Johnson letters. Redford has discovered 52 more and he 'strongly doubts the authenticity' of four printed by Chapman which he has dropped from the canon. A recurrent problem for any editor is Johnson's hand-writing, which is often difficult to decipher. Chapman spotted mistakes made by earlier editors but then went on to make some of his own. His 'Mr J Combe', for example, in a letter of 1770, turns out in reality to have been Henry Thrale's nephew, Ralph Plumbe. Clearly then, Chapman's has now been superseded by this new edition. It will be completed by a further two volumes in 1994, one of letters from 1782-84, and one containing appendices and a comprehensive index. The ordinary reader will wish to ask, is all this no doubt admirable scholarly work of editing going to alter our view of Johnson radically? Many of the texts of the letters do in fact appear here in exactly the words they appeared hitherto, including such famous letters as the one in February 1755 to Chesterfield about the Dictionary ('Seven years, my Lord have now past since I waited in your outward Rooms or was repulsed from your Door . . .') and the one to James Macpherson of January 1975 in which Johnson spiritedly refused to retract a single word of his view that the Ossian manuscripts never existed and that the whole thing was a fraud - as indeed it was. Nonetheless, Redford says of his edition that it 'aims ultimately to provide the materials for a fresh assessment of Samuel Johnson, man of letters'. Previous editors have, in Redford's view, seriously misinterpreted Johnson's tone in his letters to Hester Thrale, and by reading them in this edition we may now see how crucial these letters were to Johnson's discovery of his own potential. They do not represent a great man humouring a tiresome woman, as earlier editors tended to think, but are evidence of a deep mutual bond. Among the material not included at all in Chapman, there are printed here 12 letters to the novelist Charlotte Lennox, author of The Females Quixote. These, says Redford are 'outstanding in biographical significance'. The Lennox Collection of 42 letters came to light in the Dunfermline branch of a Scottish bank in 1964 and was acquired by the Houghton Library, where the letters were edited and published by Duncan Isles. His work is fully acknowledged in the copious footnotes to the Hyde Edition. When read in Isles's edition in the Harvard Library Bulletin, the dozen Johnson letters in the Collection - the ones printed here by Redford - are seen to dovetail with letters to Mrs Lennox from several other eminent men, such as Lord Orrery, David Garrick, Samuel Richardson, 18th century English gentlemen who went out of their way to aid this gifted woman writer. This is not to underestimate the importance of placing those letters written specifically by Johnson to Mrs Lennox in the chronological context of his entire correspondence and to find confirmed the admiration that he had for her lively mind. This enhanced view of their relations is one of the fresh perspectives opened for all Johnsonians by the appearance of this new edition. Johnson and Boswell speak nowadays with two different voices to two different audiences. One voice addresses the professors and post-graduate students whose field is 18th century English literature. The other voice speaks to the audience represented by - in Johnson's own words - the common reader. Boswell's journals have always been issued in two separate editions, a popular one with a minimum of apparatus, and a scholarly one with the full panoply of footnotes and textual glosses. The latest book in the popular series is the one-volume selection from all previous editions of Boswell's journals edited by John Wain. Boswell's amorous hopes and disappointments, encounters with the famous and the lowly, as he set them down, are one of the greatest literary bombshells to have exploded in our century. From them Boswell emerged as a person in his own right quite separate from Johnson. We can conveniently sample his whole character here. A sense of the need for a book about Johnson not seen exclusively through the eyes of Boswell prompted Wain to write a fresh life of Johnson in 1974 and in 1976 to edit the book Johnson on Johnson (the 1000th volume in Everyman's Library). The common reader might find the view from its nursery slopes a useful preliminary vantage-point before scaling the majestic heights of Redford's great new edition of Johnson's letters.</p>

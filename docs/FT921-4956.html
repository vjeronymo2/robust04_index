			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris hit by profit taking and drops in some second-liners MOST BOURSES eased back yesterday, as a dull start on Wall Street gave little incentive to extend recent gains, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS saw profit-taking in recent favourites such as Alactel Alsthom and the CAC 40 index fell 15.05 to 1,973.04 in turnover of FFr2.24bn. The television company, Canal Plus, fell FFr47 or 4.1 per cent to FFr1,105 in 48,749 shares on government support for the introduction of high-definition television, which would not be compatible with Canal Plus's decoders. The food retailer Carrefour lost FFr77 or 2.9 per cent to FFr2,603 following news late on Wednesday that its 1991 profit fell 11 per cent. FRANKFURT enjoyed selective blue-chip buying which left Daimler and Volkswagen higher in carmakers, the former leading active stocks in turnover of DM1.4bn within a day's total of DM7.9bn, up from DM7.8bn on Thursday. The FAZ index fell 0.61 to 714.36 in midsession, but the DAX closed with a gain of 5.25 at 1,674.80. Volkswagen rose another DM7.40 to DM376, rising this time on additional shifts at its Audi subsidiary to deal with strong demand, especially for its new 80 model. Meanwhile the tyremaker, Continental, which was the subject of a long courtship by its Italian counterpart, Pirelli, rose DM7.20 to DM247 following a press report than an Italian businessman, Mr Salvatore Ligresti, had bought a 5 per cent Conti stake. MILAN remained weak, and dealers expect prices to be further depressed today following news late yesterday that a modified car insurance reform had failed to go through parliament. The Comit index fell 5.26 to 520.44 in turnover estimated at L75bn after L69.1bn. Domestic selling pushed Fiat savings shares down by L140 or 3.8 per cent to L3,590 on fears of a dividend cut. Fiat's ordinary shares fell L62 or 1.3 per cent to L4,870. The cement sector was also under pressure, with Cementir losing 6.5 per cent or L155 to L2,220. ZURICH fell on the interest rate worries which depressed its banks and insurers on Wednesday. In a moderately active session, the SPI index shed 5.7 to 1,146.9. In banks, UBS bearers fell SFr60 to SFr3,790 and CS Holding lost SFr30 to SFr2,030. Credit Suisse, the latter's major asset, releases its 1991 results this morning. AMSTERDAM remained unmoved by a batch of better-than-expected company results and the CBS Tendency Index closed unchanged at 128.1 in turnover of Fl 615.3m. Heineken fell Fl 3.30 or 1.94 per cent, to Fl 166.60 as investors took profits ahead of the 1991 results which came out after the market had closed. BRUSSELS closed lower in moderate trade: the Bel-20 finished down 10.68 at 1,22.57 in turnover of BFr700m. Groupe AG, the insurer, and Generale Bank, fell as officials of both companies said that a possible merger remained some way off. The insurer declined BFr95 or 4.2 per cent to BFr2,160 while the bank shed BFr170 or 2.5 per cent to BFr6,550. STOCKHOLM's forestry sector, higher on the rising US dollar and pulp price hopes, helped the Affarsvarlden General index to a further gain of 6.60 to 980.60. The metals and industrial group, Trelleborg, which reported a 78 per cent drop in 1991 profits after hours, saw its B shares down SKr7 to SKr119 in anticipation of the event.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - MAR 5  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes  -----------------------------------------------------------------------    Open    10 am    11 am    12 pm     1 pm     2 pm     3 pm    close 1170.09  1169.95  1170.75  1169.52  1171.87  1170.99  1170.06  1169.56  -----------------------------------------------------------------------             Day's High  1172.25    Day's Low  1169.27  -----------------------------------------------------------------------   Mar 4     Mar 3     Mar 2    Feb 28    Feb 27 1176.33   1176.44   1169.17   1169.95   1167.26  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

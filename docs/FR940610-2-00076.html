			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Background and Objectives  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The SPNS program endeavors to advance knowledge and skills in HIV service delivery, stimulate the design of innovative models of care, and support the development of effective delivery systems for these services. SPNS accomplishes its purpose through funding and technical support of innovative HIV service delivery models. For purposes of this announcement, models seeking SPNS support must address at least one of the four (4) new service delivery system categories described below. Additional funding will be provided to one or more interested grantees to establish, either on site or by subcontract, evaluation and dissemination center(s) to provide technical assistance to grantees in the design and implementation of evaluation studies and dissemination activities, in collaboration with the SPNS program and the funded applicants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In establishing the current special project categories, consideration was given to the priority service areas identified in the concept paper, ``Future Directions: Increasing Knowledge about Health and Support Service Delivery to People with HIV Disease.'' This document was developed through interviews with, and written comments from, key HRSA staff and experts inside and outside the U.S. Public Health Service, and through a review of relevant HIV-related service delivery, research, evaluation, policy, and planning documents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Descriptions: HIV Service Delivery Model Categories  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Special Project Categories for FY 1994 will support the implementation and evaluation of innovative HIV service delivery models. SPNS funds cannot be used for expenses related to the provision of medical care; supportive services; or any other expenses currently reimbursed, subsidized or eligible for reimbursement through third party payors, grants awarded under Titles I-IV of the Ryan White CARE Act, or other grant and foundation sources. Applicants may not submit proposals for more than one subcategory in a category.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposals will be accepted for HIV service delivery model projects that demonstrate and evaluate:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comprehensive primary care service delivery systems for people with HIV within one of the distinct environments or settings described in the six following sub-categories.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Develop and evaluate the effectiveness of including new or existing support services as part of the basic benefits of a managed care plan or a comprehensive, coordinated care system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because one of the potential strengths of managed care plans or coordinated care systems is their capacity to coordinate the services of several providers, the proposed service delivery model must test its ability to meet the wide range of service needs required by individuals with HIV. These service needs, in addition to primary care, may include, but are not limited to, specialty medical care, mental health services, substance abuse treatment, and/or assistance with locating housing, transportation, child care, etc. Grantees must evaluate changes in: (1) Patient adherence to medical treatment plans; (2) access to and use of medical and support services; (3) costs per-patient of providing both medical and support services; and (4) patient satisfaction with services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Test the feasibility of providing comprehensive HIV services under a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capitated reimbursement system (including, but not limited to, Ryan White CARE Act Title I and Title II funds).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Grantees must evaluate patterns of utilization of medical and support services under a capitated system, compare the costs of delivering services under a capitated reimbursement system with a fee-for-service system, and evaluate client satisfaction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Add primary care services to an intermediate level of care, i. e., subsidized housing, residential care, shelter, partial hospitalization, or other type of ``step down'' setting, for individuals with HIV disease.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Grantees must evaluate the effectiveness of primary care services provided in this environment on reducing dependence on inpatient hospitalization, increasing the continuity of medical care, and improving client satisfaction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Develop, in a geographically defined rural area, a comprehensive continuum of care for the purpose of increasing accessibility and quality of primary and specialty medical care to its residents with HIV disease.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Grantees must explain how the proposed model accommodates the needs of the residents with HIV disease in relation to the health service delivery system characteristics of the area. Based on the needs of the area, models that supplement primary medical care with case management, psychosocial support, and other non-medical support services are encouraged.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Develop a service delivery model for adolescents and young adults (up to age 25) with CDC-defined Stage III or IV HIV disease that effectively manages their medical and, when appropriate, substance abuse treatment needs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Grantees should evaluate the model's effectiveness in meeting the full range of physical, psychological, social, and spiritual needs of adolescents and young adults who are seriously or terminally ill.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

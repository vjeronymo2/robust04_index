In the Statistics Center  comparison, Finland's investment in research narrowly exceeds  the average level for the European Union. Still, in Germany and  Sweden, for example, a clearly larger percentage of the gross  national product (GNP) than in Finland has been invested in  research.    About 10.4 billion markkas, which is about 1 percent more  than in 1991, was used for research and development activities  in Finland last year.    Research and development's share of the GNP rose from 2.1  percent to 2.2 percent. This relative change is in large part  due to the decrease in the GNP, but, on the other hand, it shows  that research activities have not declined at the same rate as  production.    Dependent on research activities, the Finnish high-tech  industry exported 13.5 billion markkas worth of products last  year. There were 2.7 billion markkas more in foreign high-tech  imports than exports.    In accordance with the OECD definition, production in which  research and development expenses are in excess of 4 percent of  sales volume is considered to be high tech in the Statistic  Center's calculations.    High-tech products accounted for 12.6 percent of Finland's  exports last year, which was 1.6 percentage points more than in  1991.    The most important high-tech exports were communications  equipment, electrical appliances, and ADP equipment. The  technology products most frequently imported by Finland were ADP  equipment and chemicals.  <H5>  Drugs and Communications Tops in Technology Products </H5>   According to a study conducted by Markku Virtaharju and  Mikael Akerblom for the Statistics Center, high-tech development  in Finland has focused especially on the drug industry and the  manufacture of communications equipment. These industries  clearly stand out above the others if the so-called intensity of  the R&amp;D--that is, the ratio of expenditures for research and  development to the value of production--is used as a yardstick.    The industries differ from one another like night and day as  concerns research and development activities. The communications  equipment manufacturing industry, which received the highest  rating for R&amp;D intensity, a parameter used in the Statistics  Center comparison, was 236 times higher than the publishing  industry, which received the lowest rating.    In terms of general technology levels, the highest-level  industries are manufacturers of instruments, computers, and  electrical appliances, in addition to drugs and communications  equipment. The ratio of direct and indirect investments in  technology to production value was used as a yardstick of the  technology level in the study.    Like investment in research, according to the Statistics  Center study, technology as a whole is at its lowest level in  the production of foodstuffs, textiles, and wood products, as  well as in the publishing industry. The order corresponding to  the technological levels of the industries remained in the main  the same throughout the 1980's.  <H5>  Finlandia Interface Lives Product Development </H5>   According to production chief Karl Lahtinen, Finlandia  Interface, which manufactures electrical equipment, puts well  over 10 percent of its sales volume, which will come to about 58  million markkas this year, into product development.    In the Statistic Center's classification, the industry,  represented by the company, comes under the heading of  industrial electrical equipment, which in Finland includes  mostly industries that invest in research and development  activities.    The sales volume of the company, which develops and produces  power sources, that is, certain kinds of electrical transformers  suitable for various kinds of equipment manufactured by client  firms, has quintupled over the past eight years. Over the past  two years its sales volume has nearly doubled, in part thanks to  the devaluation of the markka.    According to Lahtinen, the development effort has paid off.  They have not had to increase sales volume with [bargain] sales,  but the company's profit margin has also increased.    Along with its increased sales, the company has added to the  number of its employees, but not nearly proportionately to the  increase in sales volume. Lahtinen believes that the future of  Finnish industry is largely dependent on high tech, but it will  not become the savior of the employment situation, at least not  quickly.    According to Lahtinen, aside from being developed to be  technologically better, their products are also being developed  in such a way that they can be produced with increasingly less  labor.</p>

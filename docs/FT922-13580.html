			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / Election 1992: Truth begins to sink in at Walworth Rd BY 12.45am officials at Labour's Walworth Road headquarters had conceded publicly for the first time that the party's chances of achieving an overall majority were 'not very likely'. They insisted still that Labour would emerge in a strong enough position to force a change of government. A senior spokesman for the party said: 'The Conservatives will not have the moral authority to govern. It is going to be the worst election result of any government since the Second World War.' It was the first official reaction at the party headquarters on the result since an optimistic Mr Bryan Gould had earlier said: 'The only person who can now form a government is Neil Kinnock. The momentum is with us. The arithmetic looks most favourable to us . . . a change of government is inevitable.' His later comment confirmed the underlying reasons for the continuing subdued atmosphere at Walworth Road. Putting a public gloss on the night's proceedings, the party spokesman described as 'encouraging' the result in Pendle, Nuneaton and Walthamstow. But he added that Labour was now facing an almost insurmountable 'long haul' in reaching its original target of an overall majority. 'We would require very substantial swings in the north, the west Midlands and London to achieve this,' he said. Mr Gould had earlier discounted any possible deal between the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats, claiming that the Scottish Liberals 'would not allow this to happen now'. Mr Gould arrived having received last-minute reports from local party officials in key London marginals. These, he said, suggested that the Labour vote 'had done exceptionally well'. There had been was a tangible sense of caution in private among other party workers as the first results began coming in over the television screens. Journalists were being deliberately kept away from a party for officials and campaign organisers which was under way at Labour's temporary campaign offices at Millbank in Westminster. The strategy appeared to be to insulate any comments from within the party which might risk undermining Mr Kinnock's carefully controlled public-relations exercise which in London appeared to be relying in large measure on the personality of Mr Gould and a small carefully selected group of press officers. At the Walworth Road headquarters party workers who had immediately gone to the 'celebration' at Millbank gazed with little immediate public expression of feeling at TV sets as early results began to come in.</p>

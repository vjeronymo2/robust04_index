			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Renewed worries on inflation reversed an initial recovery in Footsie futures, with a further retreat brought on by continuing weakness of the US dollar and a fall in US markets, writes Joel Kibazo. The strong momentum seen on Wednesday looked set to continue after the September contract on the FT-SE 100 opened at 2,962. Buying, mainly from independent (local) traders sent September climbing to 2,972 within the first hour of trading, which turned out to be the high of the day. A report suggesting UK inflation is higher than had been anticipated, together with a sharp retreat in gilts, checked a further advance in the contract. With continuing worries on the US dollar, September went into decline. The afternoon only brought further selling as dealers focused on continuing falls in both US and UK bonds and the decline of Wall Street. At the close, September stood at 2,919, down 40 from its previous session and about 10 points below its estimated fair value premium of about 13. Volume was 15,211 lots. Turnover in traded options improved from Wednesday's poor level, reaching 29,220 by the close. Activity in the FT-SE 100 option at 9,286 remained poor, but there was an improvement in the Euro FT-SE option with a total of 5,924 trades. BP was the busiest stock option at 1,605.</p>

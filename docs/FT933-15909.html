			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / Progress on trade lifts G7 summit prospects: Negotiators report advance on broad tariff-cutting deal PROSPECTS for today's economic summit of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations suddenly brightened last night as trade negotiators reported some progress toward a wide-ranging tariff-cutting deal. After nearly seven hours of talks, ministers from the so-called Quad countries - the US, the European Community, Japan and Canada - said progress was made in many areas towards a market access agreement that might breathe new life into the stalled Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks. All participants warned that difficult problems remained. But Mr Kabun Muto, Japanese foreign minister, gave a hint of the scale of progress when he said accord had been reached in some areas where the negotiators wanted to cut tariffs to zero. The ministers declined to be more specific. They meet again today. Sir Leon Brittan, EC trade commissioner, said the talks had made progress on 'a wide variety of issues' and he hoped for a 'successful outcome' today. Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, was also optimistic. Earlier, it had seemed that the G7 summit - the 19th since 1975 - would open under a cloud of unresolved trade disputes. A meeting between US President Bill Clinton and Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, yesterday failed to resolve a dispute between the two countries over cutting Japan's annual current account surplus, now estimated at Dollars 150bn (Pounds 100bn). In a joint press conference, Mr Miyazawa rejected US pressure for numerical targets to cut the surplus. Showing little of the reticence normally associated with 'lame duck' leaders - he faces a general election on July 18 after losing a vote of confidence - he said it was impossible for market economies such as the US and Japan to control the level of their imports and exports and so decide the level of their current accounts in terms of a percentage of gross domestic product. In the Quad talks, disagreements between the US and EC on trade in textiles were at the centre of yesterday's problems. The US was reported to be unwilling to cut tariffs further on textiles such as woollen suits where the EC has a competitive advantage. The US fears having to extend the same reductions to China and other countries under the most-favoured nation rule. In the view of trade analysts, accord on textiles would greatly help achieve a successful market-access package. A textiles deal would clearly indicate to the other members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade that the Quad group was serious about taking multilateral trade talks forward. As G7 leaders gathered last night, Mr John Major, the prime minister, promised to 'badger and bully' the G7 to make progress on trade liberalisation this week, but acknowledged that it would 'not be easy'.

			<p><P> August 11, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART REVIEW;  </P> <P> GRAPHIC DESIGN BLESSED BY TECHNOLOGY  </P> <P> Poetic, intuitive and futuristic, April Greiman's graphic designs are in a  league of their own. Known for her pioneering computer-generated work, the Los  Angeles artist plucks imagery from hither and yon and sprinkles them into  commercial posters in editions of hundreds or thousands. Characteristically,  they manage to convey useful information at a glance while looking deliciously  spacey.  </P> <P> In a 1984 poster for a lighting-and-furniture emporium, the head of a marble  Greek god seems to be inspecting the underside of a long-legged halogen lamp,  and a blurred foot seems to be under the spell of a mysterious pyramidal  object. The center of the design is a white-hot oval glow on a yellow  background -- as if the viewer were peering blindly into a high-tech light  bulb.  </P> <P> A graceful open hand, palm up, is a recurrent symbol of creativity. It appears  in posters for a design conference in San Francisco (1987) and an architecture  school (1990), two of the clients in creative fields who apparently give  Greiman free rein to juggle somersaulting words, confettilike dot patterns,  multilayered photographic imagery, disingenuously quirky symbols and even  teasingly private asides.  </P> <P> In contrast, her poster for the 1984 Olympics is plain-Jane stuff: the crisply  shadowed legs of a woman runner in red trunks leaping from a square of bright  blue sky to a Pepsodent-tinted greensward. It's vivid, all right, and a nice  reminder of women's role in athletics, but Greiman seems to have throttled down  to a bland common denominator of taste.  </P> <P> Composing on the computer means being able to erase or redraw parts of a design  with ridiculous ease; the hard part is knowing how to control the blizzard of  possibilities at one's fingertips. For Greiman -- who also incorporates fax and  video imagery into her work -- technology's blessings make possible a new kind  of creative space replacing old-fashioned hierarchies that separate  photographic image, typographic design and text. Looking at her work, one  wonders idly what eccentric marvels the Bauhaus designers might have devised  with a Macintosh.  </P> <P> (Turner Dailey Gallery, 7220 Beverly Blvd., to Sept. 1).  </P> <P> </P></p>

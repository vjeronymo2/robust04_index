			<p><P> September 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SYLVESTER STALLONE, A MAN OF LETTERS  </P> <P> It just can't be a coincidence anymore. First there was "Rocky." Then there was  "Rambo" and "Cobra." Now, it seems that Sylvester Stallone is doing yet another  one-word title movie named after a five-lettered protagonist, "Oscar"  (mentioned in the Sept. 16 Movie Chart column).  </P> <P> He should stop beating around the bush and call all of his movies exactly what  they are: MONEY!  </P> <P> It is also interesting to note that if you replace the m in Rambo with a C and  rearrange the letters you get Cobra; and if you replace the b in Cobra with an  s and rearrange the letters you get Oscar. This means the pattern is to replace  the middle letter and rearrange the letters. Since this means that the c must  now go, I predict his next film will replace it with a t and become "Ratso."  </P> <P> PETER OLIPHANT  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

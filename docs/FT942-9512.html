			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / Survey will add to calls for postal liberalisation The European Commission will tomorrow come under renewed pressure to liberalise postal services, with the publication of a survey revealing significant dissatisfaction with the reliability and cost of services. The poll of business postal users in Belgium, France, Germany and Spain comes as the latest draft paper by the commission on drawing up a new regulatory framework indicates a move towards greater liberalisation. The Commission's paper, entitled Proposal for Regulatory Framework for Postal Services in the EU, says arguments to justify restrictions on the operation of direct mail and cross-border mail 'are not sufficiently convincing'. Following publication of a postal green paper in 1992, the Council of Ministers last December asked the Commission to come up with legislative proposals on changing the regulatory regime before July 1994. Businesses now hope the EC will increase competition in postal services, liberalising direct mail and cross-border mail and opening express services and the mailing of publications to greater competition. The survey was commissioned by the European Federation of Direct Marketing Industries representing companies such as Time Warner and Readers Digest. It was not conducted in the UK or Holland because both countries have already begun to liberalise postal services. The federation's research shows that many business postal users are unhappy with charges and the reliability of services. In particular, more than 70 per cent of German businesses are dissatisfied with postal charges and more than 80 per cent of Spanish businesses with reliability. Businesses believe the liberalisation of the postal service in the four European Union member states will improve the quality and reduce the cost of services. Almost unanimous support exists for the principle of using any private or public postal service in any EU country.</p>

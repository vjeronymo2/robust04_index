			<p>BFN     [Text] Health statistics for the month of March reveal  that 11 new cases of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)  reported to the Department of Health (DoH). [sentence as  published] Of the 11 cases, five have already died from the  disease while the virus in the six other victims are in the full  blown stage of AIDS.    However, the report did not specify how the victims were  infected. AIDS is usually transmitted through sexual  intercourse, blood transfusion or via the mother's placenta  where babies contract the virus in their mother's womb.    DoH AIDS Unit Program Manager Dennis Maducdoc said more than  half of those who were reported in the March AIDS registry are  very young. "Most of their ages range from 15 to 29," he said.  He also said that of the 11 cases, seven are assumed to have  come from commercial sex workers in Angeles City where a U.S.  organization conducted a study and found seven positive cases of  AIDS out of the 1,767 blood samples it tested.    The number of HIV-AIDS victims continues to increase as the  total number of reported cases from 1984 to February this year  reached 494. The number of full-blown AIDS cases has already  reached 136.</p>

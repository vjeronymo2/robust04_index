			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Alon Pinkas and Batsheva Tsur] </F>   [Excerpt] [passage omitted] In the Gaza Strip yesterday,  the bodies of three Palestinians were found, all apparently  killed because they were suspected of working as informants for  Israel, Palestinian reports said.    One of the three was identified as 'Abd-al-Rahman Zino, a  37-year-old ambulance driver from Gaza City. Zino, the father  of nine, was abducted from his home last Friday.    Fatimah Abu-'Awdah, 55, from the town of Khan Yunus, was  dragged out of her home by masked Palestinians and then shot  several times.    The third was Qadir Dalamli, a 35-year-old taxi driver from  Gaza City, kidnapped by masked men on Thursday.    Arab reporters said Dalamli's dismembered body was found  outside his home inside a garbage bag.    The reports said Dalamli was believed to have been a drug  dealer as well as an informer.    No group has claimed responsibility for the killings.</p>

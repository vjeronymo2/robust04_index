			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / Gunman kills former bank chief The former chairman of Greece's largest commercial bank died in hospital yesterday after being shot four times at close range, Reuter reports from Athens. Mr Mihalis Vranopoulos, former National Bank of Greece chairman, died shortly after the left-wing November 17 guerrilla group said it shot him for his role in the purchase of the state-owned Heracles General Cement Company in 1992. The deal prompted cries of unfair competition from rival bidders and accusations of bribes by opposition parties. Greece's socialists reopened the investigation of the case after winning elections and promised a full investigation.</p>

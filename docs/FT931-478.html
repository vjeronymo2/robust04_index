			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Tebbit warns City over Maastricht THE BIGGEST danger to the City is not Britain refusing to ratify Maastricht, but Britain ratifying the treaty and losing business to other financial centres, Lord Tebbit, the arch Euro-sceptic and former Tory chairman, argued yesterday. He attacked as a 'silly myth' the claim that Maastricht would lead to the City losing business to Frankfurt. 'The danger is that we may ratify and lose our business to New York, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Singapore and before long Shanghai,' he said. 'Did anyone predict the loss of business to France had their referendum vote been 51 per cent to 49 per cent instead of 49 per cent to 51 per cent against the treaty?' he asked. If Britain rejected the treaty, 'then our position within the European Community will remain precisely the same as it is today - under the Treaty of Rome as amended by the Single European Act, warts and all,' Lord Tebbit said. He said angrily: 'I am not impressed by the pro-Maastricht arguments of those pillars of the City establishment whose banks have lost billions of shareholders' money by bad business decisions when they write to The Times to say that I do not know my business as a politician. To them I say as a shareholder, 'a period of reticence might be welcomed'.'</p>

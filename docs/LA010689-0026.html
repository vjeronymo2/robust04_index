			<p><P> January 6, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> THIS VICTORY MEANS A LOT FOR AZTECS  </P> <P> This was a victory that Jim Brandenburg said he felt in his gut and his heart.  </P> <P> His San Diego State basketball team defeated Colorado State, 62-57, in front of  3,924 at the San Diego Sports Arena Thursday night, in a special game for the  Aztecs.  </P> <P> The game had significance because it meant that for the first time in 3  seasons, the Aztecs opened Western Athletic Conference play with a victory. And  to do so, they had to beat the coaches' preseason choice to win the title, a  team that had won the past five meetings between the schools, two last season  by a combined 41 points.  </P> <P> That is where the guts came into play.  </P> <P> "For the first time this year, I felt we had something down inside that was not  going to let us be unsuccessful," Brandenburg said. "I mean there was something  down inside us that we were going to stay after it and find ways to prevail. It  is that type of thing that will gel our basketball team."  </P> <P> But beyond the excitement of the moment, the game had deeper meaning for  Brandenburg. This was a matchup of friends: Brandenburg against Colorado State  Coach Boyd Grant, his roommate when the two played at the school in the mid  1950s. And for the first time in four major-college tries, Brandenburg defeated  his good friend.  </P> <P> It was not a time to gloat.  </P> <P> "If you want to know the truth, we love each other," Brandenburg said. "The  kind of affection we both have for each other will transcend this game and many  more."  </P> <P> The feeling, after more than 30 years, remains mutual.  </P> <P> "I hugged him at the half, and I said let it be tied at the end so we can go  another 5 (minutes)," Grant said, "but he didn't seem to take my advice.  </P> <P> "He has got to feel good. His team deserved to win. I enjoyed that part for him  because I know he wanted to win, and it was a big win for him, too."  </P> <P> The Aztecs (7-4, 1-0 in WAC) started as if they were going to make quick work  of the Rams (7-5, 0-1), dominating inside and on the boards.  </P> <P> Senior center Mitch McMullen scored the first five of his team-high 17 points  as SDSU took a 17-7 lead with 14:42 to play in the half.  </P> <P> But then the Aztecs got sloppy. They went on a 6:45 scoreless streak in which  they made six turnovers and missed their only two shots.  </P> <P> "We jumped out early on them; then we stopped running our offense," Brandenburg  said. "We stood around, and they just stood and matched up with us. We were not  productive offensively, and they warmed up with us."  </P> <P> That allowed Colorado State to go on a 9-0 run to draw within 17-16 at 8:10.  Pat Durham, the senior all-WAC forward who had been held scoreless through the  first 11 minutes, scored the last five of those nine points.  </P> <P> Durham would recover from his slow start to finish with a game-high 21 points.  </P> <P> "You slow (Durham) down, you don't stop him," Brandenburg said. "He is quick,  strong, puts the ball on the floor and is a great rebounder."  </P> <P> McMullen finally ended the scoreless streak with a 3-point play off a dunk to  give the Aztecs a 20-16 lead with 7:57 left in the half. But by now, the Aztecs  knew they were in for a game.  </P> <P> Colorado State drew within one twice before finally taking its first lead on  Durham's tip-in at 1:23.  </P> <P> Junior center Eric Friehauf stretched the Colorado State lead to 31-28 on a  lay-in with 49 seconds left before SDSU guard Michael Best made a 21-foot  3-pointer 15 seconds later to tie the game at 31-31 at the half.  </P> <P> The tone had been set for a contentious second half.  </P> <P> The lead changed nine times, and there were two ties in the first 11:12. No  team could take more than a 3-point lead.  </P> <P> That finally changed when the Aztecs went on a 6-point run to take a 50-45 lead  with 7:29 to play and never looked back. The first two of the baskets came on  fast-break passes from guard Bryan Williams, who finished with a game-high 9  assists (giving him 28 in the past three games).  </P> <P> The Aztecs stretched their advantage to 61-51 with 58 seconds left before the  Rams scored six of the last seven points to make the final score close. It was  quite a difference from the two easy victories the Rams scored last year  against SDSU.  </P> <P> "They are more physical and can bring it on the break better," Grant said. "We  wouldn't want to play San Diego State even if it was in the zoo."  </P> <P> The importance of the victory could be seen in Brandenburg's lack of  substitutions. Four of the starters played at least 35 minutes, and the  starters accounted for 177 of the 200 available playing minutes.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Viktor Demidenko and </F> Mikhail Melnik]    [Text] Kiev 8 June TASS -- During his official visit to  Ukraine, North Korean Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam avoided  assessing the initiative of Russia, which moved to settle the  Korean problem at an international conference.    "It is premature to speak about an international conference  on the nuclear programme of the Korean People's Democratic  Republic [People's Democratic Republic of Korea]. Russia's  initiative is yet in the state of examination," he told  ITAR-TASS here on Tuesday [7 June]. The minister avoided further  comments on this subject. He said that he would touch in  greater detail on the problem during his rounding off press  conference, which is to be held here on Wednesday afternoon.    In light of the crisis on the Korean peninsula, Russia has  moved to call an international conference with the participation  of the two Korean states, the U.S.A., Japan, China, Russia, the  United Nations, and the International Atomic Energy Agency.    Dwelling on the state of Ukrainian-Korean relations, Kim  Yong-nam noted during his talk with First Vice-Speaker of the  Ukrainian Parliament Aleksandr Tkachenko that "the KPDR [DPRK]  leadership was a dependable partner of Ukraine on the  international arena. The Korean People's Democratic Republic  wholly backs Ukraine's efforts to build up an independent and  democratic state. It is sure that Ukraine will assume a worthy  place in the world community." The North Korean foreign  minister positively assessed the decision of the Ukrainian state  to become a nuclear-free power.    The minister highly praised Ukraine's foreign policy,  because  it "comes out for the solution of all the existing problems  through negotiations and on the basis of international norms."  He thanked the Ukrainian side for its "support to the plan to  reunify North and South Korea by peaceful means." Tkachenko  described the visit of the Korean delegation as "a continuation  of the efforts to strengthen friendship between the two  countries and to consolidate the legal foundation for further  mutually advantageous cooperation between the two countries."  Thanking the minister for the invitation to visit North Korea,  he said that "the date of the trip would be decided shortly."    Different aspects of cooperation between Ukraine and the  Korean People's Democratic Republic were also discussed during  Kim Yong- sam's meeting with Ukrainian President Leonid  Kravchuk. The latter noted that Ukraine was making important  steps towards the implementation of its nuclear-free status. He  said the internal situation in the country was stable.</p>

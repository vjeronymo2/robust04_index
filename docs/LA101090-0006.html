			<p><P> October 10, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNTY AGREES TO USE DEPUTIES IN LONG BEACH  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors agreed Tuesday to a contract under  which sheriff's deputies will patrol the north end of Long Beach for the next  nine months to support that city's undermanned Police Department.  </P> <P> State statistics showed that Long Beach had the worst record of any major city  in California in 1989 for solving serious and violent crimes.  </P> <P> City officials point to the department's inability to retain enough officers as  a major reason for the ranking. The department has been plagued by labor  turmoil, contributing to the turnover, officials have said.  </P> <P> Under the contract with the county, Long Beach will pay nearly $4 million to  have 11 sheriff's cars and a total of 46 deputies patrol the city's 5th and 9th  council districts. A report from Sheriff Sherman Block said that he expects his  office eventually to be asked to provide police service for the two districts  into 1993.  </P></p>

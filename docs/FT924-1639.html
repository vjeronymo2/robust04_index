			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Clogged main road causes trouble at mill BRITAIN'S last volume manufacturer of industrial clogs is facing an uncertain future because it has become too much of a tourist attraction. Three-mile queues of cars have jammed the main road through Hebden Bridge, West Yorkshire, at peak periods and the number of visitors to Walkley mill, where the clogs are made, has passed 500,000 this year. A public inquiry will be held next year to decide whether a property development - which would help raise Pounds 1m towards a new road, a bridge over the River Calder and a car park to ease the congestion - should go ahead. 'Without it, Walkley mill could end up popping its own clogs,' said Mr Mark Clyndes, who bought Walkley Clogs from descendants of its founders six years ago. The mill employs 11 skilled clogmakers, but a Pounds 1.7m refit after a fire in 1990 enabled Mr Clyndes to bring in other crafts and speciality shops, creating about 90 jobs. He wants to build a 62-bedroom hotel, shops and housing near the mill in an Pounds 8m scheme that would include a public swimming pool. There have been objections because of the intensity of the development and the possible effect on shops in the town. A Calderdale Council planning sub-committee this month decided by one vote not to recommend the scheme, triggering a public inquiry over Walkley's appeal. Industrial clogs have had a difficult time in Britain since the advent of North Sea gas 30 years ago. Gasworks, where gas and coke were made by carbonising coal, were big customers. The thick wooden soles of the footwear insulated workers' feet. Demand fell from more than 100,000 pairs a year as gasworks closed. They slid even faster after the steel industry's coking ovens started shutting down in large numbers from the mid 1970s. The market is down to 20,000 pairs a year, with Walkley claiming market leadership through its supplies to ICI, Ford, London Brick, British Steel and Rover, as well as exports to the Netherlands and the US. The company's clog sales will be worth Pounds 350,000 this year. The company sells directly to tourists and makes a few pairs for clog and Morris dancing.</p>

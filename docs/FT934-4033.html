			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / International Company News: Shake-up in Indian mutual funds  -Foreigners are entering a fast-growing market Western companies are breaking into the fast-growing Indian market for mutual funds. Investment advisory companies in the UK, the US and in Hong Kong are trying to take advantage of the Indian government's decision last year to end state-owned institutions' monopoly of mutual fund management by permitting competition from private companies, including foreign groups. In the past few months, 19 private fund management groups have been given permission by the Securities and Investment Board of India, the market watchdog, to launch domestic funds. Last month the first two funds were launched by a joint venture between HC Kothari, a Madras-based commercial group, and Pioneer Group, a US fund management company with its head office in Boston. The partners hope to raise Rs900m for the two funds. Another three foreign companies are not far behind Kothari and Pioneer. Creditcapital, the Indian affiliate of Lazard Brothers, the British merchant bank, is launching a fund in which the European Union has promised to invest, through its developing countries' aid programme, as has the International Finance Corporation, an arm of the World Bank. Kemper, the Chicago-based financial services group, is establishing a fund management joint venture with 20th Century Finance of Bombay. The International Finance Corporation plans to invest in this venture also. Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank, is going it alone setting up a 75-per-cent-owned Indian fund management subsidiary in Bombay. The authorities expect new companies to shake up an industry dominated by the Unit Trust of India, a state-controlled giant with 30m accounts and a market share of 80 per cent. UTI's competition comes from eight funds owned by state-owned banks, which were cautiously allowed into fund management in the late 1980s. Mr Pratip Kar, SEBI's executive director, says private companies are being admitted into fund management to improve the quality of services for investors, including more transparent trading practices. Foreign groups should bring 'better know-how, better standards of compliance with rules and more advanced forms of automation.' UTI has responded to the prospect of competition by tying up with Alliance Capital Partners, a US fund manager, with the intention of jointly launching an asset management company. UTI is also investing Rs600m-700m in computers to improve control over its 41 offices and 2,100 employees. Mr S A Dave, the chairman, says: 'Over the past few years we have expanded very fast as investors have wanted to invest in a strong stock market. Now, we have to improve the quality of our services.' The authorities main aim is an overall improvement in the quality of stock market investment services for the public. Officials believe unscrupulous stockbrokers and financial advisers too often see private individuals as an easy prey. They would like to steer small-scale investors away from direct investment in shares towards mutual funds. For example, the minimum size of investment in a stock market new issue has this year been raised from Rs1,000 to Rs5,000, while the minimum mutual fund investment has been set at Rs1,000. But Mr Sudhir Virendra, chief executive of Creditcapital's mutual fund, says it will take time for private sector funds to develop their reputations. The 19 groups which have secured official approval may not all actually launch funds, given the start-up costs. Substantial profits will come only when fund management groups amass sizeable funds. 'We have to prove ourselves in the next couple of years,' says Mr Virendra.</p>

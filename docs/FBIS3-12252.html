			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The decision to suspend the Arab-Israeli  negotiations was described on the Palestinian level as being  good news and the beginning of collective Arab action.    This was said by Samir Ghawshah who was speaking in Tunis at  the end of the first meeting of the PLO Executive Committee in  the presence of the Palestinian negotiating teams.    These meetings seek to define the stand toward the U.S.  initiative for resuming the negotiations between the Israelis  and the Palestinians in Washington. The PLO Executive Committee  listened to a report by Palestinian delegation head Sa'ib  'Uraqyqat on the contacts with Washington. In light of this  report, the Executive Committee viewed the U.S. initiative as a  formal one and devoid of any content. The PLO Executive  Committee then wondered about the reason for moving the  negotiations to Washington and the representation level of the  delegations. It stressed that negotiations are not the  Palestinians' destiny and that the Palestinian people are  pursuing the intifadah in the occupied territories, as Samir  Ghawshah said. Ghawshah also emphasized the PLO Executive  committee's rejection of the measures adopted by the Israeli  cabinet yesterday because they are insufficient and do not meet  even the minimum Palestinian demands.</p>

In the famous work on March 9, 1934, President Kim Il-song  indicated a highly important guideline in the building of  chuche-oriented revolutionary Armed Forces. Thus, he opened a  new phase in the Army building and strengthened the combat  capability of the revolutionary Armed Forces as required by the  developing situation so as to expand the anti-Japanese armed  struggle.    The author of the article says:    The great leader's work is a historic work which indicated  the way of building chuche-oriented revolutionary Armed Forces  on the basis of a scientific analysis of the lawful requirement  of the military and political situation and the development of  the guerrilla Army and the prospect of the revolutionary  struggle to accomplish the cause of national liberation.    The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song taught:    "We must reorganize the anti-Japanese people's guerrilla  Army  into the Korean People's Revolutionary Army without delay as  required by the prevailing military and political situation and  the development of the anti-Japanese people's guerrilla Army."    In the work, the great leader said the Korean People's  Revolutionary Army (KPRA) should be organised in the system of a  regular Army and, at the same time, in such a system that it  could strictly observe the principle of guerrilla warfare,  taking it into consideration that the anti-Japanese armed  struggle was being waged in the form of a guerrilla warfare  against the regular Armed Forces of Japanese imperialism. He  also formulated the organisational system of the KPRA.    He said the division, regiment, company, platoon and squad  of  the KPRA should be organised in a three-unit system, that the  company should be defined as the main combat unit as required by  the guerrilla warfare and that the KPRA units should be formed  on the principle of strengthening the companies to the maximum.    In forming the units, unified command of the headquarters of  the KPRA should be guaranteed and, to this end, the general  staff should be strengthened and its role be enhanced as fully  as possible, he said.    In the work, he put forward the policy of organizing the  party committee of the KPRA in keeping with the reorganization  of the anti-Japanese people's guerrilla Army into the KPRA.    As the great leader organized the party committee of the  KPRA  and enhanced its role, the KPRA party committee could smoothly  give unified guidance to all the party committees and  organisations within the KPRA and correctly guide the Korean  revolution as a whole as the supreme leadership body.    With the great leader's unique idea of Army building fully  embodied in forming the KPRA, the KPRA grew to be invincible  revolutionary Armed Forces and played a decisive role in  achieving victory in the anti-Japanese armed struggle.    The Korean People's Army [KPA], the heir to the glorious  anti-Japanese armed struggle, defeated the U.S. imperialist  aggressor forces that had boasted of being the "strongest" in  the world. The KPA has grown stronger to be  one-match-for-a-hundred revolutionary Army firmly prepared  politically and ideologically and in military technique under  the wise leadership of its supreme commander, respected General  Kim Chong-il.</p>

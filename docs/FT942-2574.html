			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / International Company News: Ruhrkohle considers Venezuelan coal venture Ruhrkohle, Germany's largest coal producer, said yesterday it was considering taking a stake in a Venezuelan coal mining venture to increase its coal imports. The company will take 25 per cent in a four-way venture with Shell and two other companies to produce 4m tonnes annually. An entry price is still being discussed. However, the group said improved results in the power generating and trading divisions could not prevent a 34 per cent decline in profits to DM49m (Dollars 28.8m), from DM66m the year before. Turnover fell 5 per cent to DM23.41bn, in spite of slightly improved sales in the non-coal divisions. Mr Heinz Horn, chief executive, said the Essen-based company hoped to break even this year, helped by a better steel market where increased demand had helped to reduce its coke stockpiles. Mr Horn said the Venezuelan venture was designed to broaden the company's supply of cheaper, imported coal which is becoming increasingly attractive for Ruhrkohle's electricity generating clients, such as Preussenelektra, which have historically used German coal but are slowly turning to imports. 'We regard this as an extension of what we can offer our clients, especially our smaller clients,' Mr Horn said. Germany imports 20 per cent of the 50m tonnes of coal needed by power stations, but this will rise to about 30 per cent in coming years. Ruhrkohle produced 15.5m tonnes of coal in the first five months of this year. This compares with 17.9m tonnes in the same period of the previous year. Projected output for the whole of 1994 is 37.4m tonnes, down from 41.9m tonnes last year. Ruhrkohle will shed more of its 75,000 coal miners in coming years as it moves towards a projected workforce of about 60,000 by the end of the decade. Overall, the group employs 111,150 people.</p>

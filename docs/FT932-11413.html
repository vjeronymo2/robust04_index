			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / Survey of Flanders (10): Petty feuding stops here - Andrew Hill reports that beer bridges the linguistic divide IF THERE is one element of Belgian culture which bridges the linguistic rift between Flemings and Walloons, apart from the royal family, it may be beer. In fact, some 80 per cent of Belgium's 120 or so breweries are in Flanders. Gambrinus, the 'King of Beer', may have been a 13th century Duke of Brabant, Louvain and Antwerp, and one of the patron saints of beer is St Arnoldus - a Fleming. But there is only one Belgian Brewers' Confederation and so far nobody has tried to split it down the middle. Beer, it seems, is above such petty feuds. In any case, it would be very difficult to divide Belgian beers, geographically or by nationality. Grimbergen, for example, is an abbey north of Brussels, well inside Flanders. But the fruity beer for which it is famous is now brewed by Alken-Maes, one of Belgium's two big brewers, near Charleroi, in Wallonia. Alken-Maes is responsible for the eponymous Belgian pils, Maes, and the 'European' lager Kronenbourg, and has its headquarters in Flanders, but last year BSN, the French food group, increased its stake in the company to 75 per cent. Interbrew, meanwhile, owner of the Stella Artois and Jupiler, is still family controlled, and has its roots in Leuven, Flanders. But its outlook is international, and its interim managing director is a Frenchman. In any other sector, such developments would arouse the latent fears of Flemings - and Walloons - that a great national industry is coming under the thumb of foreigners. But although 80 per cent of the Belgian market is controlled by these two giants, they know better than to dilute the great strength of Belgian beer - its local variety. They have learned their lesson from the classic riches-to-rags-to-riches tale is of white beer - a cloudy, refreshing brew which almost died out in the 1950s as small specialist brews were being driven out of the market. Family brewers in the small Flemish town of Hoegaarden revived the beer in a fit of nostalgia in the mid-1960s, and it quickly took off. Such was its success that the Hoegaarden brewery has since been bought out by Interbrew, which has even begun production of white beer as far away as Texas, and there are now a dozen white beers on the market. In a world preoccupied with tradition, it would clearly be commercial death to try to homogenise Belgian beer. In the late 1980s, Interbrew even had to change the image of Stella Artois - a relatively ordinary beer by the standards of some of Belgium's more exotic brews - to revitalise its home market, by emphasising the beer's roots in the country's great brewing traditions. With demand in Belgium shrinking, export of specialist brews is now the best way for many Belgian brewers to keep going, according to Jan De Brabanter of the Belgian Brewers' Confederation. 'In Spain, for example, Belgian beers aren't considered as competitors (of local beers), but as a way of reactivating a beer culture,' he says. '(Diversity) is our main fame. That's why specialist beers are so important to us, and why the Belgian beer economy isn't going to shrink to just a few big brewers. There really is a future even for the very small.' The promotion of specialist beers is also the best way for the industry to protect itself from the criticisms of the anti-alcohol lobby, according to Mr De Brabanter. That is the thought behind the slogan the brewers have devised for future advertising campaigns: 'A beer brewed with love is always drunk in the right spirit' - one reason, at least, for glancing at the menu next time you're in a Brussels cafe and seeking out a Hoegaarden, a De Koninck or a Duvel, rather than a simple Stella or Maes. As Michael Jackson advises in his seminal work The Great Beers of Belgium: 'Never simply ask for 'a beer' in Belgium.'</p>

			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Elswick rises 70% to Pounds 1.72m ELSWICK, which sold its bicycle business last year to focus on print and packaging, reported a 70 per cent rise in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 1.72m and restored dividend payments. The improvement reflected a 21 per cent increase in operating profit for the six months to July 31 to Pounds 2.23m (Pounds 1.85m) and a 39 per cent reduction in interest payment to Pounds 511,000 (Pounds 835,000). Profits last time were depressed by losses of Pounds 465,000 from discontinued businesses. The main one was Falcon Cycles, sold in December. Sales of continuing businesses were up 5 per cent at Pounds 28.5 (Pounds 27.1m or Pounds 31.9m with discontinued businesses). Mr Bill Cross, chairman, said the results reflected the resilience of its core printing and packaging activities. There is an interim dividend of 0.15p (0.22p). No final dividend was paid last year. Earnings per share were 0.63p (0.41p).</p>

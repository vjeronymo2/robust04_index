In the meantime, Speaker-Elect of the State Duma Ivan Rybkin  speaking late on Friday [14 January] described Vice Premier  Aleksandr Shokhin as the only candidate professionally fit to  take the post. Shokhin belongs to the Party of Russian Unity  and Concord.    At the same time, the Speaker called for committees to be  formed on a proportional basis so that none of the factions  remained unrepresented.    The Russia's Choice Party [RC] will not allow extremists  from  the Zhirinovskiy-led faction to take control of the key  committees, and above all, the foreign relations committee, RC  spokesman Kirill Ignatyev told Interfax. He said Zhirinovskiy's  chairmanship of the committee would mean instability and  probably war to Russia.    The faction will stick to its position in talks with other  groups, Ignatyev said. Leaders of the parliamentary factions  and Rybkin-led New Regional Policy group are due to meet at  14:00 on Saturday to discuss the sharing of committees among  them.</p>

			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / International Company News: Record year at Deere put down to confidence Deere and Company, one of the world's largest farm equipment producers, reported record profits for the fourth quarter and the year, saying growing confidence among farmers in North America and in Europe has contributed to strong sales. Mr Hans Becherer, Deere chairman, said near-record net farm cash income in the US this year 'should provide a solid base for 1995 farm expenditures,' and that the implementation of Nafta and growing incomes in developing countries such as China and India should promote better export markets for US grains and oilseeds. As a result, Deere said it would expand its North American production tonnage schedules by 4 per cent in 1995, with the largest boost planned for the first quarter of next year. At the same time, as part of a continuing restructuring in Europe, overseas production tonnage will decline by about 6 per cent. For the fourth quarter, Deere reported net income of Dollars 169.6m, or Dollars 1.97 a share, compared with income of Dollars 93.1m, or Dollars 1.20, before special accounting and restructuring charges, in last year's fourth quarter. Sales in the quarter rose 16 per cent to Dollars 2.5bn, from Dollars 2.2bn. Of that, Dollars 515m was outside North America. For the year, Deere posted net income of Dollars 603.6m, Dollars 7.01 a share, up from Dollars 248m, or Dollars 3.21, before special charges.</p>

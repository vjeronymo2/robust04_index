			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Southern states that there would typically be other business reasons for creating Project Parents. Southern states that, for example, the interposition of one or more wholly-owned Project Parents may be necessary to minimize U.S. income taxes (e.g., by deferring repatriation of foreign source income, or in order to take full advantage of favorable tax treaties among foreign countries). Further, Project Parents are useful in cases in which Southern may bid as a part of a consortium of companies, since each member of the consortium will typically want to have at least one consolidated subsidiary in the final FUCO ownership structure for tax and accounting purposes. Finally, Project Parents serve to isolate business risks and facilitate subsequent adjustments to or sales of interests among or by the members of the ownership group. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Southern proposes herein that a Project Parent may also acquire and hold direct or indirect interests in both FUCOs and EWGs. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  The ability to combine ownership of both FUCOs and EWGs under a single company will enable Southern to minimize the number of separate intermediate subsidiaries needed in connection with its investments in EWGs and FUCOs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> An entity engaged exclusively in the business of holding the securities of one or more EWGs may itself seek a determination of EWG status from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. However, such an entity could not hold the securities of both EWGs and FUCOs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Southern states that, within 45 days after Southern determines that the purposes for owning any Project Parent no longer exists, it shall liquidate or dissolve such Project Parent, unless, within that time, Southern determines that such Project Parent may be used in conjunction with a proposal or plan to acquire an interest in a different Exempt Subsidiary. Southern requests authority to liquidate or dissolve any Project Parent under such circumstances. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Southern also requests approval for any Project Parent to issue equity securities and debt securities to persons other than Southern (and with respect to which there is no recourse to Southern), including banks, insurance companies, and other financial institutions, exclusively for the purpose of financing (including any refinancing of) investments in Exempt Subsidiaries. Such securities may be issued in one or more transactions from time to time through the earlier to occur of (i) December 31, 1996, and (ii) the effective date of any rule of general applicability adopted by the Commission exempting such transaction from the application requirements under the Act. It is proposed that the aggregate principal amount of non-recourse debt securities issued by Project Parents to persons other than Southern will not exceed $800 million at any one time outstanding. No more than $200 million principal amount of such non-recourse debt securities at any time outstanding may be denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. In any case in which Southern directly or indirectly owns less than all of the equity interests of a Project Parent, only that portion of the non-recourse indebtedness of such Project Parent equal to Southern's equity ownership percentage shall be included for purposes of the foregoing limitations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Equity securities issued by any Project Parent to any party other than Southern may include capital shares, partnership interests, trust certificiates, or the equivalent of any of the foregoing under applicable foreign law. Non-recourse debt securities issued to parties other than Southern may include secured and unsecured promissory notes, subordinated notes, bonds, or other evidence of indebtedness. Securities issued by Project Parents may be denominated in either U.S. dollars or foreign currencies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Southern states that the amount and type of such securities, and the terms thereof, including interest rate, maturity, prepayment or redemption privileges, and the terms of any collateral security granted with respect thereto, would be negotiated on a case by case basis, taking into account differences from project to project in optimum debt-equity ratios, projections of earnings and cash flow, depreciation lives, and other similar financial and performance characteristics of each project. Accordingly, Southern requests the authority to negotiate the terms and conditions of such securities without further approval by the Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> January 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 6 TAKE OUT NOMINATION FORMS FOR LA CANADA COUNCIL RACE  </P> <P> Six La Canada Flintridge residents have obtained nomination papers from the  city clerk's office in the first week of the filing period for the City Council  election April 10.  </P> <P> Since Jan. 11, when the documents became available, the city clerk's office has  provided forms to Elizabeth Blackwelder, Melvin Ricks, John Hastings, Gordon  Breitman, Mayor Edmund Krause and Councilwoman Joan Feehan, according to City  Clerk Pat Anderson.  </P> <P> Krause and Feehan, both incumbents whose four-year terms expire in April,  announced their candidacies earlier this month.  </P> <P> Hastings was elected to the City Council in 1985 to fill a vacant seat and  served as mayor pro tem in 1987. He and then-mayor J. Bixby Smith were defeated  in their 1988 reelection bids in an acrimonious campaign that focused on  accusations that the council was pro-growth and fiscally wasteful.  </P> <P> Blackwelder is president of the La Canada Trails Council. Ricks is a dentist  and Breitman is a physician, both with practices in Glendale.  </P> <P> Prospective candidates for the three council posts have until Feb. 1 to obtain  signatures from at least 20 registered city voters and submit the paper work to  the city clerk's office.  </P></p>

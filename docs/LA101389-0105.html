			<p><P> October 13, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SKIPPER OF SOVIET BOAT APPARENT SUICIDE VICTIM  </P> <P> The skipper of the Soviet Union's entry in the Whitbread Round the World Race  was found hanged in a tree in Punta del Este, Uruguay, the first stop in  sailing's premier ocean event.  </P> <P> Authorities said Alexei Gryshenko committed suicide. Two notes were found in  his pockets, one asking his wife and parents to forgive him.  </P> <P> Gryshenko, 43, had organized the first Soviet bid in the quadrennial race but  was due to return home for unexplained reasons after the first leg from  England, in which the 82-foot sloop Fazisi placed sixth among 24 boats.  </P> <P> John Jourdane of Long Beach, the navigator aboard New Zealand entry Fisher  &amp; Paykel, said by phone Thursday that Gryshenko had said "he felt  inadequate, compared to Skip Novak, who is extremely experienced."  </P> <P> Novak, an American, was co-skipper of the Soviet boat, which is expected to  continue. The United States has no entry.  </P> <P> Jourdane said Gryshenko was found "in a tree about a mile from the boat. They  actually showed it on (local) television . . . him hanging from a tree."  </P> <P> Jim Lutz, a Los Angeles schoolteacher aboard the English entry Liverpool  Enterprise, said: "It sent a little tremor through the fleet . . . upset  everyone."  </P> <P> Tass, the official Soviet news agency, said of Gryshenko: "He was an introvert,  a reserved man who spoke little. He took close to heart all problems connected  with the project, even those that did not relate to him. He expressed regret  that he was unable to fulfill the role of captain adequately. This testifies to  the fact that he suffered a nervous breakdown."  </P> <P> Steinlager of New Zealand won the first leg, followed by Merit of Switzerland  and Fisher &amp; Paykel. The second leg of the 32,932-nautical mile race will  start Oct. 28, from Punta del Este to Fremantle, Australia.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 1 KYODO -- The Food Agency on Friday  [1 April] retained 20 trading companies as government-designated  rice importers for fiscal 1994, turning down applications from  other firms to become such agents, agency officials said.    The Agency also retained 26 companies as  government-designated importers of wheat, barley and rye for the  year that started Friday, they said. It was the first time in  nearly a quarter of a century that the Agency accepted  applications from firms other than designated importers to enter  the rice import business. However, it approved none of the  applications.    Industry sources said a dozen nondesignated companies filed  applications following Japan's agreement in December at the  Uruguay Round of global trade talks to partially open its rice  market. Under the designated agent system, established in 1957  when Japan was importing rice, the government imports the grain  but consigns the actual importing to approved trading companies.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Lebanese National Congress concluded its  meetings in Paris today. General Michel 'Awn had called for  this conference, which was attended by Dory Sham'un, leader of  the National Liberal Party and many Lebanese expatriates and  opposition figures, in addition to French figures from the  Senate and National Assembly. Our colleague Salim Badawi will  tell us about the final session, decisions, and recommendations:    [Begin Badawi recording] [First,] declaring the foundation  of  the Lebanese National Congress as a comprehensive united  institution that embraces the national current whose objective  is to achieve Lebanon's freedom, independence, and full  sovereignty over all its territories within its  internationally-recognized historical border.    Second, the constituent body of the congress, together with  those in charge of it, will form a constituent assembly to draft  its bylaw and to appoint its legislative and executive staff.    Third, the congress announces the formation of the board of  trustees under the chairmanship of the secretary general who  will be in charge of running, organizing, and activating the  general secretariat.    Fourth, the congress announces the formation of the national  assembly, which will be considered the legislative body of the  congress.    On the other hand, the Lebanese National Congress defined  its  militant priorities through the following objectives:    [First,] liberation through organizing ties of cohesion and  cooperation among the Lebanese to activate their role toward  expanding the field of militant action on the Lebanese and  international levels.    Second, mobilizing the potentials of the Lebanese throughout  the world to influence the decisionmakers, particularly in the  five permanent members of the Security Council.    Third, the congress will establish ties with international  and regional organizations -- East and West -- particularly the  ones that have influence on the Lebanese future.    Fourth, the congress charged the board of trustees with  following up dialogue and constitutional studies with prominent  Lebanese and international experts to lay out and present  alternative options to the sectarian system so that this will  prepare for a secular political system that transfers power from  the sects to the government.    Regarding the peace process, the congress believes that the  Israeli-Arab peace process, which began in Madrid in the wake of  the Gulf war, constitutes the most important political framework  to the Lebanese future. The statement adds: It would be a big  danger to Lebanon's sovereignty and independence if Lebanon  participated in the talks through a government whose  decisionmaking is captive and seized and which lacks legitimacy  and popular authorization.    The final statement adds: Lebanon insists that its war has  not ended, its peace will not be genuine, and its people will  never enjoy sovereignty, freedom, and independence so long as  the non-Lebanese forces have not withdrawn from all the Lebanese  territory, in accordance with Security Council Resolutions 425  and 520. Lebanon is eager to have excellent relations with all  its neighbors, not distinguished with any party. The congress  also called for achieving a solid and comprehensive Lebanese  reconciliation among the Lebanese leaders who agree on  negotiations to liberate Lebanon within the framework of a  transitional government that represents all parties that accept  the principle of peace and work toward this objective.

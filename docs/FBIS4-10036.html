			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Brasilia "special correspondent" Elia Simeone R.] </F>   [Excerpt] Latin American governments will alert U.S.  President Bill Clinton to the need to enhance relations with  that country and to work in greater concert with one another to  solve the problems confronting the hemisphere.    The request will be submitted to the U.S. President during  the summit of the Americas' heads of state, which has been  called by Clinton himself in Miami at the end of this year.    This resolution by Latin American governments was adopted  during the meeting of Rio Group foreign ministers, which ended  here in Brasilia on 22 March.    The agreements reached at this meeting were publicized on 22  March by the three foreign ministers who make up the troika of  the Rio Group, namely, Brazil, Chile, and Ecuador.    Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim, in his capacity as  pro tempore secretary, highlighted that the Rio Group resolved  to start a process of consultations and coordination in order to  present a united front at the Miami summit.    Chilean Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa stated that one of  the agreements included the aforementioned need for closer  political relations between the United States and Latin America,  which will be raised for Clinton's consideration.    He said that within this framework, subjects of common  interest like the strengthening of democracy, governability,  hemispheric security, drug trafficking, and terrorism could be  tackled in a more appropriate way.    The foreign ministers also agreed to call Clinton's  attention  to the social development issue, Latin American countries'  efforts to combat poverty, the need to introduce changes in  Latin American countries' education systems, and to have greater  access to technology.    The Brazilian foreign minister noted that some of these  questions were briefly touched upon during U.S. Vice President  Al Gore's visit to Brazil on 22 March, which only lasted for a  couple of hours.    With regard to Latin American governments' expectations of  the Americas' summit, Figueroa said the meeting's objectives are  not very clear since the letter Clinton sent to his Latin  American counterparts does not state what the United States  expects from this summit meeting and only mentions his interest  in drafting a common agenda.

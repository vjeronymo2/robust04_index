			<p><P> November 12, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY POLITICS  </P> <P> If the reaction of his South Bay colleague, state Sen. Ralph C. Dills, is any  indication, state Assemblyman Richard E. Floyd was wise not to ask the  Legislature to put his sports betting proposal on the November, 1990, ballot.  </P> <P> "It's bad public policy for the state of California to get into gambling," says  Dills (D-Gardena), chairman of the Senate Governmental Organization Committee,  a panel that handles gambling legislation. "It's somewhat juvenile and  hypocritical to believe that to legalize something that's not good will make it  good."  </P> <P> Floyd (D-Carson) is avoiding the Legislature and turning to the public instead.  On Oct. 30, he filed a sports betting initiative that will appear on the ballot  if supporters gather the valid signatures of 595,485 registered voters.  </P> <P> Floyd says his proposal represents a good way to put bookies out of business  and to create a new tax source to raise money for state programs for the  elderly and basic local services such as police protection. Dills disagrees.  </P> <P> "It's sad that we can't take care of the elderly and pay for police without  resorting to bad solutions like gambling," says the senator, who favors  increasing the state income tax instead. "There's no greater gamble than the  stock market these days. If (people) want to gamble, why don't we just let 'em  gamble on that?" George Hatch  </P></p>

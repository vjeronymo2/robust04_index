			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Strive To Initiate a New Prospect for Our </F> Region's United Front Work"]    [Text] The regional united front work meeting, held by  Tibet regional party committee, has successfully concluded. It  earnestly studied and implemented the guidelines of the National  United Front Work Conference and Comrade Jiang Zemin's important  speech. It also planned for relevant work for the next stage,  closely integrating Tibet's actual conditions and studying the  situation and tasks for Tibet's united front work in the new  era. Deepening and implementing the national and regional  meetings' guidelines on united front work, bringing every  positive factor into play, as well as strengthening the unity of  all party and nonparty nationalities and people will definitely  further consolidate and develop stability and unity. It will  also quicken the pace of reform, opening up, and modernization,  as well as initiate a new prospect for Tibet's united front work.    United front work, which the party established under Comrade  Mao Zedong's leadership, is an important magic weapon for  achieving victory for our country's revolution and construction.  Due to historical and social reasons, there is a special  position and role for Tibet's united front work. The work  consistently came under the kind attention and direct guidance  of Mao Zedong and other revolutionaries of the older generation.  In the course of peaceful liberation, democratic reform, as  well as socialist revolution and construction, our party has  extensively united nationalities, religious patriots, and upheld  the banner of patriotism, unity, and progress. The people have  firmly safeguarded the motherland's reunification and opposed  splittism and retrogression. They have stood together with the  party through thick and thin, and participated in political  consultations and cooperation. They have made contributions to  consolidating Tibet's political power, as well as economic and  cultural development. Practical social experiences over a long  period have fully proven that there is great vitality in the  party's united front work in Tibet. The work is closely linked  to the region's revolution and construction, as well as  nationality development and progress. In the course of reform,  opening up, and modernization, we must continue and magnify the  fine tradition of united front work, the advantages of wide  contacts between the work and people, insist on basing all tasks  on Tibet's actual conditions, as well as strive to initiate a  new trend and prospect for Tibet's united front work to make it  more dazzlingly brilliant.    Quickening the pace of reform, opening up, economic  development, and establishing the socialist market economic  system will definitely produce a profound impact on the united  front work. It will bring new characteristics and demands for  the work. First, united front work must be centered on economic  development. We must bring every positive factor into play to  contribute more toward Tibet's reform, opening up, economic  construction, and social stability. Thus, great structuring has  taken place in Tibet's united front team. It has transformed  from a team with nationality and religious circles as the main  body into an enormous and powerful force composed of  nationality, religious, intellectual, and economic circles as  well as Tibetan compatriots of insight outside the country. It  is necessary to widen our vision and unite to the utmost. The  scope of united front has enlarged, its tasks increased, and the  work has developed in various fields and grass-roots level. It  is more obvious that the united front work has developed toward  the people and society. It is necessary to vigorously develop  socialist democracy and continue to strengthen and perfect the  political consultation system. We must widely adopt the  people's suggestions and good ideas, as well as pool together  the force and wisdom from all sides to change Tibet's  backwardness as quickly as possible. We must bring into play  our party's historical experiences and special advantages in the  united front work. We bring every positive factor of all sides  into play and struggle together to fulfill the glorious mission  entrusted to us by the era. Just as Comrade Gyaincain Norbu  pointed out at the meeting: "The tasks of Tibet's united front  are not reduced, but increased. It is not that the tasks are  not indispensable, they are even more important than at anytime  in the past."    The patriotic united front must earnestly do a good job in  nationality and religious work. Tibet is a nationality  autonomous region mainly populated by the Tibetan nationality.  The majority of the people believe in religions. It bears  significance to the overall situation, whether in the past,  present, or future, to earnestly do a good job in religious  work. We should adopt patriotism and socialism as our political  foundation to bring about unity of the Tibetan-Han nationality,  unity of Tibet's nationalities, as well as unity within the  Tibetan nationalities. In addition, we should bring about the  great unity of Tibetan compatriots in and outside the region,  aimed at safeguarding the motherland's reunification. We should  comprehensively and correctly implement the party's religious  policy, strengthen the management of religious affairs in  accordance with the law, and actively guide religious circles to  adapt to social development and progress. Patriotic united front  should actively undertake the antisplittism struggle to  safeguard the motherland's reunification, nationality unity, and  social stability for creating a good social environment for  Tibet's reform, opening up, and modernization.    United front work is the entire party's work that requires  the attention of party committees and governments at all levels  and great support of relevant departments. This is a  fundamental guarantee for consolidating and developing united  front to make it glow. Leading comrades at all levels must  deepen their understanding of the importance, necessity, and  protracted nature of united front, as well as realistically  strengthen their leadership over the work. They must  incorporate united front work into party committees' agenda and  tackle it unremittingly. They should earnestly strengthen  cooperation and political consultations with nonparty  personages, make more and close friends outside the party, as  well as modestly listen to their opinions to truly practice  democracy in policymaking. The important requirement of whether  or not a leading cadre possesses a sense of united front,  knowledge of the united front policy, and capability of  implementing the united front work is used for evaluating his  policymaking and leadership quality. Party committees at all  levels in the region must earnestly implement the guidelines of  the national and regional united front work meetings, do a good  job in united front work, not indulge in empty talk, and do more  practical work so that the party's "magic weapon" will bring  into play its true role for Tibet's economic development and  social progress.</p>

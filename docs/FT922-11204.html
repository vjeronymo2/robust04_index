			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / Five contestants in the race to be Commons referee Peter Brooke Age: 58 Constituency: City of London The Northern Ireland secretary until the election is seen as the Tory front runner. He is admired for his wit, patience and courtesy but some Tories have said they would not support him because they think the office of Speaker should not go to someone so fresh out of the cabinet. Paul Channon Age 56 Constituency: Southend West The former cabinet minister - he left office in 1989 after an unhappy time as trade secretary and then transport secretary - has stayed in the Commons to become a senior backbencher. His 30 years' service at Westminster may attract some Tories but he seems the outside candidate. Terence Higgins Age: 64 Constituency: Worthing The chairman of the all-party Treasury committee and of the liaison committee of committee chairmen, he is the senior figure of the select committee system set up in 1979. He has demonstrated his independence of government, but some colleagues favour a less dry personality. Sir Giles Shaw Age: 60 Constituency: Pudsey A popular former middle-rank minister and on the 1922 executive. He has particular support from the 'knights of the shires'. He has served as a chairman of committees considering legislation but he may be too much a Tory establishment figure to attract opposition support. Betty Boothroyd Age: 62 Constituency: W Bromwich The only Labour candidate has attracted praise as a deputy speaker for humour and warmth: she responded 'call me madam' when asked how she should be addressed. Some MPs favour electing the first woman to the office but most Tories may want to retain it for one of their own.</p>

			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / Reservations underlie welcome for Cadbury THERE was almost universal support throughout the City and the UK's boardrooms yesterday for the final Cadbury report on the way companies are run - at least on the surface. Underneath, however, there remained nagging concerns, particularly from companies. Mr Charles Nunnelly, managing director of Robert Fleming Asset Management, said: 'You can't be against it. You have to be for it. 'The danger is that while the reaction is lovely and warm, no one will do anything about it.' The warm words - flavoured with disaffection about the way the report might interfere with the relationship between companies and shareholders - were in abundant supply yesterday. They could even be heard coming from the Confederation of British Industry, which previously condemned the requirement for companies to comply with the Cadbury code of conduct as a condition of a Stock Exchange listing. Yesterday the CBI toned down its criticisms. An official said: 'A code of best practice which can be reviewed and updated is better than wholesale intrusion by the law, which would be inflexible and slow to change. Moreover, the report makes it clear that individuals and companies will need to follow the code in the light of their own circumstances.' The Institute of Directors, which had also voiced criticism of the draft report, gave its 'strong support' to the final document, which it said went a long way to meeting the organisation's reservations. Mr Peter Morgan, IoD director-general, said the original emphasis on the separate roles of executive and non-executive directors had damaged the belief in unitary boards. He said most concern had been largely allayed by the tempering of 'divisive proposals' concerning non-executive directors. The IoD backed the statement of compliance and, like the CBI, welcomed the committee's decision to restrict the remit of auditors in reviewing the code of compliance, although it warned that the audit function would place a 'particularly heavy burden' on smaller quoted companies. Mr Morgan said the committee's recommendations, with the development of new accounting standards, would help to restore falling public confidence in corporate governance. Institutional investors, meanwhile, were also generally happy that recommendations they had made after the interim report appeared to have been taken up in the final version. The Institutional Shareholders' Committee, the umbrella body representing various groupings of investors, said it would meet to discuss its reaction within a fortnight, but there were signs yesterday that its members welcomed the new paper. The National Association of Pension Funds said: 'We will play our part and encourage our members to play their part as well.' It said it believed in the division of responsibility between chairmen and chief executives of public companies, and would continue to press for a strict separation of the two roles. Institutional investors also appeared happier to take on a more central role in enforcing the code of conduct. 'I think that's fair enough. From our point of view, we try to stand up and do our bit,' said Mr Barry Southcote of CIN, investment manager for the Coal industry pension funds. There was general support for the new recommendation that investment managers should disclose their policy on voting at companies' annual meetings - although several pointed out that this could cause difficulties for fund managers who needed shareholder approval before voting. While the debate on corporate governance is the topic of the moment, it may have little impact in the long term. As Mr Roger Davis, head of audit at Coopers &amp; Lybrand, said: 'The great pity is that corporate governance is a cyclical activity. It's topical now, but in a recession mavericks lie low.'</p>

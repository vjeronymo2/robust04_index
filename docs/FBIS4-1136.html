			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg April 21 SAPA -- The Independent  Electoral Commission [IEC] on Thursday [21 April] said it would  send 20 mobile stations to dispense temporary voter cards at  hostels across The Reef on Friday. IEC Chairman Mr Justice  Johann Kriegler told a press briefing in Johannesburg the  commission would set up voting stations at hostels on April 27  and 28.    IEC Monitoring Director Peter Harris said an additional 1.2  million temporary voter cards had been sent to the Transkei for  voters in outlying areas. About 1.3 million cards had been  issued so far, he said.    Mr Harris said the IEC had held "a successful election dummy  run" to see if it was ready for the real event. About 11,000  monitors had been deployed at voting stations countrywide  between 4AM and 9AM. The aim had been to see if the commission  could get its monitors in the field, he said.    The trial had been successful, although there were some  transport and telecommunication problems in a few regions. The  reaction time in Natal had been slow, but would improve. Some  retraining of monitors was necessary, he added.    The IEC has received an additional R1.4 million [rand] from  the Norwegian Government for voter education programmes in  Natal, in conjunction with the United States-based South Africa  Free Election Fund, which has deployed 25,000 [figure as  received] monitors in the field, at Home Affairs offices and at  magistrate's courts.    Mr Justice Kriegler said it was doubtful if voter education  in Natal would reach the same level as elsewhere in the country.</p>

			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Survey of Turkey (10): Euphoria has evaporated - John Murray Brown examines Turkey's role within Central Asia A year ago, such a trip would have generated considerable public interest. But when the late President Turgut Ozal set off on a gruelling five-country tour of Central Asia last month, it merited scarcely a comment in the local Turkish press. Turks, like many outside the country, are starting to make a more sober assessment of the opportunities offered in the newly created Turkic-speaking states of former Soviet Central Asia. Much of the euphoria has evaporated. At first, Ankara took it as welcome vindication that the leaders of Central Asia seemed to aspire to follow their own moves to open up to the west, a process started when Mustafa Kemal Ataturk founded the country on the ruins of the Ottoman Empire in the 1920s. However, as one academic, familiar with the region, put it: 'They said much the same thing to Brezhnev and Stalin.' Turkey's strategic role as a moderate secular counterweight to Iranian fundamentalism has probably been overplayed. What has also been overblown is Turkey's capacity to play a role as the catalyst for economic development in the region, given budget problems at home. 'Turkey is not pretending to be a regional power. All we want is to help them make a soft landing in coming into the new world,' says Mr Ozdem Sanberk, under secretary at the Tukish foreign ministry. Turkey shares common cultural, linguistic and religious ties. But the physical limits to co-operation are immense. Turkey has no common border with any of the five Central Asian states, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. Even with the Caucasian state of Azerbaijan, Turkey is cut off by Christian Armenia. The Turks have made much of the pipeline accord to take Azerbaijan's crude to the Mediterranean. But this project, like all similar proposals to provide a route to take the region's vast natural resources to western markets, depends on the co-operation of Iran - and if not Iran, then the Armenians, with whom Turkey has an equally troubled relationship. No one is denying that Turkey will have a role to play. Turkish banks are setting up operations in the region. Ziraat, the state-owned farm credit bank, has established joint ventures in Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and most recently in Turkmenistan. 'The general strategy is to be the first western bank. The market is not large enough for two international banks,' says Can Oner, the director in charge of Central Asian operations. Significantly, it is the state sector banks which have led the way. Private banks remain more wary. 'Ziraat is the first in. It may make sense. If you are a local bank you perceive the risks differently. However, look what is happening in Russia, surely a better prospect. As far as I know only two foreign banks have progressed past the stage of having a representative office,' says a London-based trade finance specialist. Bankers admit it is still almost impossible to quantify the risk in those areas. Nonetheless Turkey has already much of the legal infrastructure, such as investment protection agreements and accords on the prevention of double taxation. Since the area opened up, Turkey has signed more than 100 bilateral accords with these countries. Latest trade figures suggest, at least as far as cash transactions are concerned, the opening up of Central Asia has had little impact on Turkey's balance of payments. For the 11 months to November 1992, Turkey's total exports to the former republics of the Soviet Union came to Dollars 1063m, little more than the Dollars 986m achieved in the same period in 1991. Moreover Russia accounted for Dollars 909m. Import statistics reveal a similar picture. Trade volume - imports and exports - with the Turkic states was less than Dollars 300m. While the figures probably do not include barter items, they nonetheless emphasise that Turkish trade ties with the region remain very modest. But some multinationals are looking at links with Turkish groups, to gain an early foothold in these markets. Jacobs Suchard, the Swiss confectionery group owned by Philip Morris, has acquired a 50 per cent share in Turkey's largest edible-oil company. The strategy is to use this Turkish operation to market the whole range of Jacobs Suchard products in Turkey and the Central Asian states. Merloni, the Italian white goods concern, best known for its Ariston brand, has acquired a stake in Turkey's Vestel electronics group, again in a bid to provide a platform for sales to the Caucasus and beyond. In areas like telecommunications, Netas, Northern Telecom of Canada's Turkish subsidiary, is blazing a trail. With the help of a government project to supply digital switches for public exchanges to all five Central Asian republics, Turkey's private telephone manufacturers are quietly stealing a march on some of the larger foreign names. On the back of this, Ankara is beaming Turkish television - a move which will have important strategic consequences for the chances of Turkish groups. Indeed, the Turks are in the vanguard in a range of infrastructure projects. John Laing, the UK civil engineering group, has a contract in partnership with Turkey's Alarko Holding to build the airport at Ashkabad, the Turkmenistan capital. Cultural bonds are also being slowly forged. More than 8,000 students are now studying in Turkish universities. There are even cadets from the area in Turkey's military academies. Following a conference earlier this year, Ankara announced it was to add five new letters to the Turkish alphabet, in a bid to encourage the republics to adopt the Latin script, something they lost in the early 1920s after Stalin, then minister for minorities, forced them to take up Cyrillic. Political dividends have been harder to come by. Many Central Asian leaders went away from the Ankara summit last year, disappointed that Turkey was unable to offer more than worthy statements. What is emerging is that many of these states retain a strong dependence on Russia, economically and politically. Some would suggest there are even some sentimental ties. It seems it will difficult for the Central Asians to sever their links with Moscow.</p>

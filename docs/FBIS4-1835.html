			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Debbie Kuo] </F>   [Text] Taipei, April 4 (CNA) -- A government spokesman  here Monday [4 April] called on mainland Chinese authorities to  reveal the cause of a mysterious boat accident in which 24  Taiwan tourists perished.    Government Information Office director-general Jason Hu  urged  mainland authorities to face the accident "honestly" and  "responsibly."    The charred corpses of 24 Taiwan tourists, two mainland  Chinese guides and six crewmen were found piled in one room of a  tourist boat on March 31. The boat was on a cruise of Thousand  Island Lake in Zhejiang Province when the still unexplained  deaths occurred.    News of the accident was not released until two days after  the event occurred, and all Taiwan reporters were barred from  examining the boat or any of the 32 corpses after the boat was  removed to a shipyard in Chunan, Zhejiang.    Zhejiang security officials also destroyed film of the site  taken by a TV reporter from Taipei's China Television Co.    The Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), Taipei's non-official  conduit for mainland-Taiwan relations, Monday urged mainland  authorities to reconsider a Sunday decision to bar SEF officials  from even visiting the site.    SEF counterpart, the Association for Relations Across the  Taiwan Straits (ARATS), in a fax Sunday to the SEF, made only  perfunctory reference to the incident and did not detail reasons  for the fire and death of the tourists.    The deaths are widely believed to be the result of foul  play,  possibly the work of thieves who took advantage of lax police  presence on the lake.    Meanwhile, about 50 family members of the victims arrived  Monday in Chunan to help police identify the corpses.    Angered with the mainland's handling of the case, the family  members have demanded the mainland authorities make public the  true cause of the accident, allow SEF personnel to the site, and  respect the relatives' wishes regarding the handling and  transport of victims to Taiwan.</p>

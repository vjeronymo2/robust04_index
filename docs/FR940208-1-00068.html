The Administrator will specify appropriate reporting and recordkeeping requirements as part of the review of the permit application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Each owner or operator of a bulk gasoline terminal subject to the provisions of this subpart shall submit to the Administrator a quarterly report of exceedences or failures to maintain, as appropriate, the monitored operating parameter value required under &sect;63.427 (a) and (b). Owners and operators of new bulk gasoline terminals subject to provisions of this subpart shall submit to the Administrator a quarterly report of all instances in which a vacuum are not maintained in a gasoline tank truck during loading. These quarterly reports shall contain the monitored operating parameter value readings for the days on which exceedences or failures to maintain have occurred, and a description and timing of the steps taken to repair or perform maintenance on the vapor collection system or parameter monitoring system. A report is not required for those quarters where there were no exceedences or failures to maintain, as appropriate, the operating parameter and no instances in which a vacuum was not maintained.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) Owners and operators complying with &sect;63.427(a) shall maintain a record of the monitored operating parameter data at the facility for 5 years. This record shall indicate the time intervals during which loadings of gasoline tank trucks have occurred or, alternatively, shall record the operating parameter only during such loadings. The date and time of day shall also be indicated on this record.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g) Owners and operators complying with &sect;63.427(c) shall maintain a record of the gasoline tank truck pressure data at the facility for 5 years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h) Each owner or operator of storage vessels subject to the provisions of this subpart shall keep records for 5 years and furnish reports as specified in &sect;60.115b of this chapter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Each owner or operator of equipment subject to the provisions of this subpart shall keep records as specified in &sect;60.486 (b) through (j) of this chapter, and shall furnish reports as specified in &sect;60.487 of this chapter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (j) The reports required under all paragraphs of this section shall be consolidated into a Periodic Report and submitted to the Administrator on a semiannual basis.

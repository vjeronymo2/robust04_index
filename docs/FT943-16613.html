			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Tractor production increases 40% Tractor production at the the main UK plants has been running up to 40 per cent higher than last year to meet stronger demand in Britain, continental Europe and North America. New Holland Ford, the largest of the British manufacturers, said production schedules at its plant in Basildon, Essex, provided for the production of 31,000 tractors this year, 40 per cent more than last year. Mr Bob Humphrey, marketing manager, said: 'About 30 per cent of the hours worked in the plant are on overtime.' Massey Ferguson Tractors, whose Dollars 330m (Pounds 214.5m) takeover by Agco of Atlanta from Varity Corporation was completed last week, reported that it would sell 10,500 tractors by the time its Coventry plant closed for the holidays later this month. In the same period last year it sold 7,500 units. UK tractor registration figures, published today, are expected to show a 15 per cent downturn last month from May. But tractor registrations for the first half of the year of more than 8,800 are nearly 10 per cent higher than at the same time last year. Mr Aaron Jones, managing director of Massey Ferguson, expects tractor sales in the UK to be 11 per cent higher this year than last, compared with 8 per cent in continental Europe and 12 per cent in North America. Mr Jones was cautious about longer-term sales, however. The Agriculture Engineers Association noted that UK sales this year were still likely to be the third worst on record. However, it expects that the positive balance of trade on agricultural machinery, the bulk of which is tractors, will grow to about Pounds 350m this year from Pounds 240m last year. Tractor demand in the UK, rising from its lowest point in 1992, reflects the improved confidence of farmers against the background of higher market prices for arable products and higher support payments under the European Union's Common Agricultural Policy.</p>

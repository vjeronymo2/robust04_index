			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / World Trade News: S Korean investors switching to S E Asia SOUTH-EAST Asia displaced North America last year as the prime area for South Korean direct investment abroad, mirroring changes in trade patterns, John Burton writes from Seoul. Korean investment in South-East Asia grew by 29 per cent to Dollars 555.7m (Pounds 368m), which accounted for 44 per cent of Dollars 1.26bn that Korean companies invested overseas last year, according to the finance ministry. It was the first time in 11 years that South-East Asia was the favourite region for Korean investors, who were attracted by the area's expanding markets and its production costs, which are lower than in Korea. Meanwhile, Korean investment in North America, its biggest export market, fell 16 per cent to Dollars 391.6m as its share of Korea's trade shrank slightly. However, the biggest jump in investment growth occurred among the current and former communist countries, with which Korea has established diplomatic relations in recent years. Investment in these countries climbed by 174 per cent to Dollars 174.4m, from Dollars 63.7m in 1991. The sizeable increase was due to rapidly expanding investments in China, following the establishment of diplomatic ties last August. China investments rose to Dollars 141m (Dollars 42.5m in 1991) and it attracted the largest number of new investments - 171 projects out of 500 by Korean companies last year. In addition, investment in Hong Kong rose to Dollars 43.9m from Dollars 13m. But investments in the former Soviet Union dropped to Dollars 4.2m from Dollars 17.8m the previous year,in spite of a visit by Russian President Boris Yeltsin to Seoul last autumn to solicit support for his country. Korean companies instead preferred to invest in China and Vietnam, which received Dollars 16.8m. Western Europe was another area for sharp growth in Korean investment, with a 56 per cent rise to Dollars 144.3m. The former Czechoslovakia and Hungary were the main beneficiaries of Korean investment in eastern Europe, with amounts of Dollars 6.1m and Dollars 4.2m respectively. Investments in Latin America fell by 13 per cent to Dollars 36m.</p>

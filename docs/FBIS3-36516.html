Peacekeeping Will  Cost Moscow a Lot"]    [Excerpt] As reported, during Russian President Boris  Yeltsin's official visit to Georgia, representatives of the  Russian and Georgian sides signed the agreement "On the Status  and Conditions of Functioning of the Russian Federation Border  Troops Staying on the Territory of the Republic of Georgia."  Pavel Grachev said in an interview to Georgian journalists that  a protocol of intention concerning Russian bases in Georgia was  also signed during the visit. In his words, it is planned to  set up three bases: in Tbilisi (in the Vaziani area),  Akhalkalaki, and Batumi. The Batumi military base, Grachev  said, would have branches in Poti, Sukhumi, and Gudauta. The  bases will rely only on the Russian troop units in the  Transcaucasus that are currently deployed in the areas. Pavel  Grachev's last statement refutes recent rumors that Russian  military units leaving Germany will allegedly be moved to  Abkhazia and other Georgian regions. According to Grachev,  warships of the Black Sea Fleet are planned to be stationed in  the Poti area. All the bases will be set up by 1 July 1994.    In his interview for the SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA newspaper, which  was published 4 February, Pavel Grachev said with regard to the  military bases' objectives: "The objectives of these military  bases are to ensure the security of Russia and the states of the  Transcaucasus region that are parties to the Collective Security  treaty. When asked whether the question of border troops was  resolved, Pavel Grachev noted that the existing border between  Georgia and Russia will not be moved. Regarding the  resubordination of Russian troops deployed in Abkhazia to  General Reut, commander of the Group of Russian Forces in the  Transcaucasus, the Russian defense minister remarked that all  troops staying in Georgia are subordinated to Reut except for  the 345th Airborne Regiment, which, according to Grachev, is a  regiment subordinate directly to the Russian defense minister  and remains his strategic reserve. Answering a question by  SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA's correspondent about to whom the Russian  troops that will serve as peacekeeping forces in Abkhazia will  be subordinated and who will finance them, the defense minister  said: "These troops are under the command of Colonel General  Georgiy Kondratyev. As for financing, this is a painful  question. We still do not have a UN Security Council mandate  for Russian troops to carry out peacekeeping missions in the  former USSR countries, for them to be peacekeepers under UN  aegis. This is why they do not pay us and we have to bear all  the costs on our own. Nonetheless we do not give up our  mission, seeing Georgia as a single body." [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / Concern at EU policy weakness A French initiative to strengthen the political leadership of the European Union in the run-up to the Maastricht treaty review conference in 1996 has highlighted weaknesses in its provisions for a common foreign and security policy. Diplomats and European Commission officials said yesterday that Mr Alain Lamassoure, France's European affairs minister, had pinpointed the lack of a proper structure to prepare and execute 'joint actions' such as the organisation of aid to the Israeli-occupied territories and political-military action in Bosnia. 'It's all been a bit amateurish so far,' said one Brussels official. Mr Lamassoure expressed concern about weaknesses in the management of EU foreign policy in an interview with the Financial Times. He also disclosed that France, in concert with Germany, Italy and Spain, was planning a more coherent leadership for the EU during their successive presidencies in 1994-96. The French initiative did not appear to be an attempt to establish a big-country directorate of the EU, nor intended to be a slight on the current Greek presidency. The 1991 Maastricht treaty is an elaborate compromise between federalism and looser co-operation between governments. Although it provides for a common foreign and security policy, signatories, most notably France and the UK, were admanantly opposed at the time to diluting national sovereignty in foreign policy. France appears to have grasped that the present arrangement may be too loose for effective action. However, its unwillingness to see the Commission or the Council of Ministers' secretariat filling the vacuum underlines the limited scope it sees for ceding power to new EU machinery, such as the policy unit set up by Mr Hans Van den Broek, political affairs commissioner. A senior Brussels official noted that the Commission had no policy planning staff, nor did it have an in-house foreign policy think tank. There was scope for creating something more permanent, he suggested. These ideas may arouse some discomfort in London. Despite nominal support for the concept of a common European foreign policy, UK ministers prefer looser arrangements with limited goals.</p>

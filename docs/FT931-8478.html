			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Kuwaiti MPs open a magic cave: National assembly flexes its muscles over foreign investments FOR the first time in Kuwait's history, a small group of elected representatives will examine the state's books. Under a law formally promulgated in Kuwait last week, all state-owned companies and investment organisations, must now pass their accounts to the auditor general. He must then pass them to a committee of Kuwaiti MPs. The law, which will also toughen penalties for misuse of public funds, is likened by its drafter, Mr Hamad al-Jouan, chairman of the National Assembly's legislative committee, to the secret word with which Ali Baba opened the magic cave. 'With this law we have invented our secret word for that cave to open.' The cave, of course, contains Kuwait's rich - if these days diminished and scandal-tarnished - trove of overseas investments, most of which are managed by the London-based Kuwait Investment Office. 'Since the earliest days of democracy in Kuwait, people have been asking what KIO was doing,' says Mr al-Jouan. 'But parliament has never had the strength to make such a law a reality'. That changed last October, when Kuwait's 84,000 eligible voters returned what many of the 50 elected MPs consider to be the Gulf state's most powerful National Assembly ever - and certainly the most powerful assembly in the Gulf. In three-and-a-half months, the assembly has mandated parliamentary scrutiny of the state's accounts, and embarked on an unsparing examination of what went wrong in the days leading up to the Iraqi invasion in August 1990. Next it wants a decisive say in determining economic policies. In a country which has seen almost as many suspended parliaments as sitting assemblies since the 1962 constitution came into force, MPs finally appear to have won a measure of real governing power. This is not a development which will bring hails of joy in neighbouring capitals, where vaunted steps towards wider political participation more closely resemble a reluctant shuffle. Nor is it entirely to the liking of the ruling al-Sabah family. However, since their return to liberated Kuwait in 1991, they have had little choice but to accommodate a profoundly changed public mood. In part, this reflects anger at the way the al-Sabah handled the crisis before the invasion, and its indecision afterwards. However, increasingly, it reflects growing suspicion that al-Sabah hands have not been the safest for guaranteeing the security of Kuwait's endowment to its future generations: being its foreign investment bounty. The emergence since the end of the Gulf war of a stream of embarrassing revelations about Kuwait's overseas investments, which topped Dollars 100bn (Pounds 69bn) before the Gulf war, not only helped sweep an opposition majority into the National Assembly, but gave the new MPs a considerable lever over the ruling family. It already appears that some members of the al-Sabah family may face prosecution for their part in the Dollars 4bn losses of Grupo Torras, KIO's Spanish holding company. Meanwhile, Kuwait's public prosecutor is helping to prepare a criminal law suit against former KIO executives in London. 'This affair runs very deep,' says one western diplomat. The government has said it will do its utmost to uncover and punish all wrongdoing at KIO - whatever the family names of anyone found guilty. It has also agreed to allow the assembly freedom to conduct its own investigations. But if the al-Sabah have agreed to cede some of their governing power to the National Assembly, the parliament in its turn appears to have come to an understanding with the 'political leadership' in the family. In the words of one eminent MP: 'We're saying give us more power to supervise our wealth and our future, and in return, the government can look after the investigation and punishment of its own.' This, in essence, appears to be the deal being cut between Kuwait's assertive new parliament and its ruling family. 'The National Assembly understands our ruling family very well,' says Mr al-Shatte. 'It also remembers the suspensions of previous parliaments, and we have decided not to push affairs to a confrontation'. But he adds something of a warning. 'We will also not accept mistakes by important people which could be considered crimes.' Kuwait lives in too unstable a region to wish to damage entirely the credibility of its rulers. As a local diplomat says: 'Whatever internal conflicts there may be here, there is unity towards the outside world. And there has to be.' Kuwaitis concede damage from row, Page 23</p>

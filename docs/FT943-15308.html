			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / Arts: Heritage at a price - Classing a Van Gogh as an historic monument is costing the French government dear Last week, the French ministry of culture gave only half a sigh of relief after a Paris appeal court reduced compensation, payable by the state to Jacques Walter, the owner of a Van Gogh painting classified as an 'historical monument', from Ffr422m to Ffr150m. The tortured and claustrophobic 'Jardin a Auvers', painted a few days before the artist's suicide, had been classified and prevented from leaving the country in July 1989. It was sold at auction in Paris in December 1992 for Ffr55m, a sixth of its estimated value on the international art market. The compensation which the state must now pay, for the first time ever, is equivalent to 18 months of the budget of all France's national museums for the purchase of works of art. The advisers of culture minister Jacques Toubon met immediately after the court's ruling to discuss whether the state could avoid payment and also ponder the wisdom of taking the case a legal step higher to the Cour de Cassation. Alarmed by the Walter verdict, French art historians, museum curators and Mr Toubon have called for radical legal and fiscal reforms to preserve the nation's artistic heritage without bankrupting the state through the purchase of works at international prices it can ill afford, or the payment of compensation. The ministry of culture hoping that the compensation award might be overturned, waited for last week's verdict before deciding on its next moves on tax reform. Toubon, who says he is very impressed by British tax facilities in the same field, could start pressing his finance ministry colleagues in the autumn for fiscal reforms which would constitute a different form of compensation for the owners of national art treasures, and one less traumatic for museum funds. Ministry advisers have been working on proposals to waive death duty, for example, for the owners of art works which have dropped in value because they cannot be sold on the international market - either because the state has taken the unusual step, as with the Van Gogh, of making a work an historical monument, or more simply, refusing it permission to leave the country. Jacques Walter's Van Gogh was classified before the introduction last year of a system of 'certificates', which are required to enable works of art of a given market value to leave France. Dismayed by the Walter verdict and unhappy with the certificate system, Pierre Rosenberg, curator-in-chief of paintings at the Louvre, and Francoise Cachin, head of Paris's Orsay Museum, have demanded a new legal and tax framework to preserve the country's art masterpieces. Both curators have praised the way in which Italy, Germany and Spain list works which may not leave the country and have enthused over the 'pragmatic wisdom' of Britain's methods of retaining art works of interest for a period of six months and granting tax favours to art owners. Francoise Cachin and Pierre Rosenberg have called on the French government as a matter of urgency to boost French museums' meagre Ffr100m annual budget for acquiring works of art. They also recommend tax measures similar to those under discussion by the ministry of culture to encourage art collectors not only to preserve, but also to acquire national treasures. Making French cultural authorities additionally nervous this summer, is another lawsuit being pressed by Jacques Walter to obtain nothing less than restitution of the extraordinary Walter-Guillaume art collection housed in the Orangerie in Paris. It comprises, among many others, 24 Renoirs, 16 Cezannes, 10 Matisses and 12 Picassos, and was bequeathed to the state in two instalments in 1958 and 1963 by Juliette Lacaze, successively the widow of the dealer Paul Guillaume and of Jean Walter, the father of Jacques. The Walter family claims that Juliette Lacaze donated money to the Louvre to enable the museum to buy the paintings, thus disguising the donation as a purchase to avoid a legal obligation to bequeath part of the heritage to her husband's children. Following last week's verdict on the Van Gogh compensation, Jacques Walter also intends attacking the French state in the European courts for failing to pay interest on the Ffr150m which he may now, at long last, receive.</p>

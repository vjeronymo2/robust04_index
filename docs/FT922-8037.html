			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / MPs censure PSA Services THE management of PSA Services, the government agency that carries out building works for the Civil Service, has been censured by the Commons public accounts committee. The agency - which is due for privatisation later this year - had to write off invoices worth Pounds 65.6m in its 1990-91 accounts because customers would not accept them. That followed difficulties in implementing new systems which the PAC describes as 'a most serious matter'. The snags arose when government departments became free to employ private-sector companies for building works on April 1 1990. PSA Services introduced new financial systems to cost and invoice work at the same time as preparing for privatisation. Difficulties in implementing the new systems and inadequacies in the underlying records led to errors on customers' invoices. Payment on those invoices was delayed or withheld and the Pounds 65.6m shortfall was met from public funds. The PAC notes PSA Services' assurances that there is no evidence of impropriety, but says the breakdown in controls created an environment 'in which impropriety could flourish and be difficult to detect'. PSA Services Accounts 1990-91. HC208. HMSO. Pounds 8.75.</p>

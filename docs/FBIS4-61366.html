			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" report No. 68 of 5 May 94] </F>   [Text] Political scientists see the Civic Accord, a  civilian peace deal between Russia's reformists and hardliners,  signed at a ceremony in St. George's Hall of the Grand Kremlin  Palace on April 28, as an indication that the time of political  violence is receding into the past. The document has been  signed by the leaders of practically all regions and republics  of the Russian Federation, many political parties, trade unions  and religious denominations. Analysts expect that more  signatures will be added to the agreement.    President Boris Yeltsin's chief of staff SERGEY FILATOV  talks  to our correspondent Vasiliy Kononenko about the difficulties  the preparation of the accord involved.    Corr.: What made the Civic Accord necessary?    Sergey Filatov: The amnesty declared by the State Duma (the  lower house of parliament) gave an impulse to the work on the  document. It was obvious that the amnesty was a purely political  move, which pursued aims that had nothing to do with  stabilization in Russian society. We had immediate evidence  that this was true - signs of a fresh confrontation and total  mistrust of authority. And that came after we had got through a  tremendous ordeal and were at last ready to adopt a new  constitution. The president gave his first message to  parliament, and the government announced its program. Those  documents were expected to provide a basis for conciliation in  order to overcome the crisis.    So we the presidential team started wondering if, at this  time of constant surprises, it is possible to put an end to  confrontation, which not only exhausts society psychologically  but brings to naught economic reforms. It is largely for this  reason that crime has been rampant in Russia, and foreign  business began to be afraid to make investments into the Russian  economy. So the president and his closer associates came to the  conclusion that there was a need for a document on social  conciliation in a broad sense.    Corr.: How did the work on the document proceed in concrete  terms?    S.F.: Yeltsin set himself the aim of putting an end to  political punchups and making the principal parties talk to each  other.    At first, potential participants were chosen for such  consultations representing political and public organizations  that have support in various social strata.    It was decided to put Academician Boris Topornin - not an  official but an influential academic - at the head of a team  drafting the text of the document. Then it was suggested that  round table discussions be held on some concrete aspects of  further work. The text had to be constantly improved. Sometimes  this led to scandals. For example, one of the State Duma  members, without seeing the final version of the accord, accused  its authors of playing a dirty game.    Corr.: What was the essence of the principal disagreements?    S.F.: There were three main points of difference. First of  all, we argued about what the document was to be called, an  agreement, a declaration, a memorandum, a charter, or an accord.  Then there were objections because the text of the document was  similar to that of the Russian Constitution. Then there was the  problem of carrying out the accord and monitoring its  implementation.    In the course of consultations, the sides decided to set up  a  conciliation commission. But now we believe that even that  commission should be controlled by a group of top officials to  take care of particularly grave conflicts.    There were probably three main causes of agitation. The  first was the attempt of Valeriy Zorkin, former chairman of the  Constitutional Court, to overtake the president's initiative.  The second was the ultimatum made by Gennadiy Zyuganov, leader  of the Communist Party, who said there could be no conciliation  in society before the policy of reform was abandoned, the social  system changed, and many people removed from the present  leadership. And the third was the split in the State Duma  during the debates on the accord. The president then held an  urgent meeting. There was no panic: we already had a rough  picture of the alignment of forces throughout the country. And  on that basis we came to the conclusion: most of the influential  movements were in favor of the accord, while the resistance on  the part of some parties would be compensated for by support on  the part of the trade unions.    I was sure nothing would go wrong at the final stage,  because  quite soon, after a new law on elections came out, a  presidential election campaign would start, and Russians would  evaluate the candidates on the basis of their attitude to the  Civic Accord.  <H5>  FATEYEV: CONFLICT IN OSSETIA NEEDS NEW APPROACHES </H5>   The Ossetian-Ingush dispute may seem trivial to those who  know the history of Russia and the USSR only superficially.  However, even though the two nations are small, the dispute may  threaten the unity of Russia. Interfax's Yuriy Sheyn  interviewed VALERIY FATEYEV, 48, member of the Federation  Council, member of its Security and Defense Committee and Deputy  Economics Minister. He headed the Federation Council's  commission that visited the Northern Caucasus recently.    Corr.: North Ossetia's President Akhsarbek Galazov said in  parliament that the Federation Council's Northern Caucasus  commission lacked insight into the region's problems.    Valeriy Fateyev: As the commission stayed in the Northern  Caucasus we met with the leaders of three republics there,  Galazov of Northern Ossetia, Aushev of Ingushetia and Dudayev of  Chechnya. We had talks with representatives of interest groups,  political parties and religious confessions.    We also conferred with the leadership of the provisional  administration in the conflict area. We attended a meeting of  the Military Council and discussed the regional problems with  officials of the power ministries operating in the area. All  the military and political issues were discussed.    We discussed ways to normalize the situation with the top  officials and field commanders of the Industry Protection Board.  The delegation visited a refugee camp, talked with displaced  persons in Ingushetia, met with the families of Ossetians and  Ingush. We wanted to know the opinion of common people who are  victims of the conflict. For several days the delegation shared  in the activities of the Ossetian-Ingush reconciliation  commissions to understand the mechanism of their operation. We  also met with the local Cossacks. I think that our commission  has studied the situation in depth.    Corr.: Did you see documents that could shed light on the  root causes of the conflict and ways to put an end to it?    V.F.: All field data and maps of what happened in September  and October 1992 were made available to the commission. We  learned about the industries, economics and finances of the  republics, talked to experts and top official of ministries,  obtained data on migration and destruction of homes. We studied  press reports and testimony of witnesses.    Corr.: Was any information made available to your commission  in Moscow?    V.F.: Unfortunately, numerous matters have not been  clarified. Some documents were contradictory, some were in  archives. The commission had Federation Council Vladimir  Shumeyko sign requests to the Russian Federal  Counterintelligence Service, Defense Ministry, the National  Security Council and the Interior Ministry for more documents.    We asked for and obtained data on sales of weapons in the  conflict area and analyzed data on the stationing and movement  of troops during the conflict. Archives of the USSR Supreme  Soviet since 1992 were studied. Some of the documents we  obtained were signed by Stalin, Kalinin or Beriya.    True, we could not possibly obtain and analyze all the  relevant documents.    Corr.: What conclusions did the commission make?    V.F.: In my view, the roots of the conflict are not  territorial or ethnic or religious or historic. The most  important issue is power, the ability or otherwise of the  authorities to enable people of any confession, ethnic origin  and time of stay in the area to live side by side in peace.    The officials who made a political evaluation of the tragedy  had to be guided by this requirement rather than by what is  apparent in lower echelons of authority or is in the mind of the  common Ingush or Ossetian. The federal authorities should rise  above specific details and tackle the overriding issues, above  all the ability of the authorities to handle the situation.    The mass media described what happened in Northern Ossetia  and Ingushetia variously as genocide, ethnic cleansing, war and  conflict. The central authority cannot rely on such  definitions. Human rights must be the overriding consideration  and so the central authority should concentrate on what should  be done to have life in the area return to normal rather than on  what happened there. Incidentally, it is still happening because  houses are destroyed, people killed, hostages taken and acts of  terror committed.    The federal authorities should not evaluate the situation by  the number of people killed. If 1000 were killed at the peak of  the conflict and then as few as 10 died monthly, the central  government should not close its eyes on the killings, otherwise  one could believe that the death of one person is a tragedy and  of tens of people is statistics.    Corr.: What is the situation in the region now?    V.F.: I am saying that the authorities of Northern Ossetia  continuously violate human rights and are in breach of law and  order. This is the briefest possible description of what is  going on there.    You will have remembered that the conflict flared up and  developed within Northern Ossetia and acts of violence were  committed against its population. As a result ethnic Ingush  population had to leave their homes. Now it is essential that  they return. That's the long and the short of it.    The issue is, however, being made unduly complicated. In  particular, the Ingush Republic is being dragged into the talks.  But it did not even exist at the time when the conflict erupted  and the Ingush had to flee Northern Ossetia (IF Note: It was  part of the Checheno-Ingushetia).    Accusations are levelled at (Ingush President) Ruslan  Aushev.  But what has he to do with this? The problem is in Northern  Ossetia. We have to thank Aushev for giving the shelter to the  ethnic Ingush who fled Northern Ossetia. We can only think of  asking him to help bring the refugees to where they used to live  give them a three day supply of food. Everything else is up to  Northern Ossetia, I think.    What kind of talks can be held? Who should talk to whom?  The republic is Ingush but this does not imply that its leaders  should enter talks about the return of ethnic Ingush to their  homes in Northern Ossetia.    I was the head of the Smolensk Region administration (IF  Note: in the West of European Russia) which borders on Belarus.  If an ethnic conflict involving Belarussians [Belarusians]  occurred there and people were forced to leave their homes,  would I have to negotiate with my counterpart in Belarus? To me  it sounds absurd, speaking mildly.    Above all, if I represent the authority throughout an area  and not the interests of some ethnic group, I have to prevent  any conflict. If it does happen, it is my problem. As an  official in power I must have the refugees return, apologize to  them and provide normal life for them. If it is short of cash,  the region should apply to the federal government for it but  never drag its neighbors into the matter.    In short, I see two causes of continuous human rights  violations in the Northern Caucasus. The first is the inability  of the North Ossetian authorities to provide law and order and  peaceful coexistence of people in its territory. The second is  inconsistency and incompetence of the federal authorities who  are likely to make decisions for expediency, neglecting the  interests of small nations and rely on the use of force in  resolving conflicts.    Corr.: Why did some members of parliament accuse you of  partiality?    V.F.: Our conclusions resulted from what we learned from the  sources I mentioned. The conclusions could not be entirely  impartial but the commission was as unbiased as it is humanly  possible when it suggested remedies. We as (ethnic) Russians  have no national or family or religious ties in that area.    Besides, the commission members were well-trained to discuss  and analyze the situation and make decisions. Above all, we  understood the danger of allowing the situation to continue as  it is.    Some media accuse me of being pro-Ingush. So does North  Ossetian President Akhsarbek Galazov and some other political  figures. Others think, however, that my policy is pro-Ossetian.  My position is pro-Russian because peace in Russia will not be  stable unless there is peace in every republic and area.    The accusations that Galazov levelled at me are explained by  the fact that the commission pronounced a judgment on the  performance of the North Ossetian authorities. His case that  the sources of information our commission used were irrelevant  has no leg to stand on. This is the reason why Galazov did not  attend the parliamentary discussion of the essence of our report.    Corr.: When you spoke of inconsistence and incompetence of  federal authorities, did you mean the provisional administration  in the conflict zone.    V.F.: I meant the central authorities. In particular, the  central authorities passed a decree on political and territorial  rehabilitation of the nations that fell victims to reprisals but  the decree provided no mechanism of carrying this through.  Forcible movement of whole nations hundreds of kilometers away  from their homes into another social medium was unprecedented at  this scale. (IF Note: Stalin ordered deportation of the Ingush  people to the Siberia and Central Asia in March 1944 because  they allegedly collaborated with the Nazi troops who never  entered Ingushetia. It was not until 1957 when the Ingush were  allowed to return home. By that time the borders of North  Caucasian republics were not what they had been before the  deportation).    Corr.: The Federation Council will not meet until the end of  May. Do you think its work was effective.    V.F.: I will speak of its effectiveness only in the matter  we  have talked about.    Last January the Federation Council receives a presidential  decree ordering another extension of the emergency rule in the  Northern Caucasus. The upper house decides - rightly, I think -  that it cannot rubber stamp decrees, especially so because  emergency has been in place for nearly 18 months without any  tangible results and the refugees have not returned home.    Because the Federation Council had never dealt with the  conflict, its deputies thought that they could impartially sort  it out and help ease the tension by saying what they found.    A commission is set up which goes there and drafts advice on  the situation. The time comes when a decision has to be made.    The upper house heard the commission but there was no voting  on its conclusions. The council did not tell the commission to  formulate a draft. Nor was a political judgment pronounced by  the upper house even though it was made in my report. A  decision was made to continue the hearings and set up a  commission which could attend the National Security Council  meeting where the issue will be discussed. The Federation  Council proved to be incapable of anything better than this.  Then its members left for home. It is after this that a  Russian servicemen was killed and numerous hostages taken by  both sides in the conflict.    The conflict was scheduled to be discussed by the National  Security Council in March but it was not until late April that  this happened.    On April 4 a decree extending the emergency rule is sent to  the Federation Council. This document is not good at all. It  was worded in Vladikavkaz, the North Ossetian capital, and  signed in Moscow.    I told the deputies that the decree could not be approved  because it would deprive the Russian troops of their rights and  disable the administration. Nonetheless, the decree was  approved in a voting by secret ballot. I think that some  members misunderstood the situation while others voted so to  promote their own political interests. Some probably allowed  themselves to be talked into voting so.    Corr.: What steps could lead to normalization of the  situation?    V.F.: I think that emergency rule should be imposed  throughout Northern Ossetia because its authorities are  incapable of coping the crisis. Under the emergency rule, the  executive power in the area will be vested in central  authorities and their representative bodies in Northern Ossetia  while the Northern Ossetian legislature will be suspended.    IF Note: The Federation Council has recently approved a  presidential decree placing a few more settlements in Northern  Ossetia under emergency rule. The Russian prime minister has  signed an ordinance extending the powers of the provisional  administration head in some areas of Ossetia and Ingushetia.  Our commission also suggested helping the new Ingush republic  in the setting up of bodies of authorities. They should not be  built along the group, clan or family lines but should include  capable local people and knowledgeable financiers, economists  and lawyers from the Russian Federation. These people should  not go there as exiles or for a brief stay there but must have  solid social guarantees and have homes there so that they could  bring their families with them and make a good job of helping  Ingushetia. If they decide to stay in Ingushetia, so much  better for that republic and the whole of Russia. If they  return to ethnic Russian areas, the country will still benefit  from their stay in Ingushetia because they will become more  experienced experts. This kind of training was used in the  former USSR and was not so bad. We need such people in  ministerial positions rather than the yesterday's pseudo-  democratic demagogues.    Furthermore, I think that the Federation Council must set up  a standing commission to monitor the situation in the conflict  zone.    Finally, Moscow must start talks with the Chechen Republic  immediately.    These are the conclusions and proposals the commission made  after it had seen the situation first hand.</p>

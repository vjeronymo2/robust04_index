The Armenian  Defense Ministry press service reported that a relative calm has  prevailed on Armenia's borders for the last three days.    The relative calm established along most of Karabakh  frontline in recent days is still being maintained.  Nagorno-Karabakh Republic Defense Army headquarters reported  that the fighting continued only in the north of Kelbadzharskiy  Rayon in the direction of Omar Pass over the last day. But  dense fog and heavy snowfall on the mountains are hampering  active military operations.    Despite that, the Karabakh forces managed to destroy one  enemy armored car and three troop carriers, and killed a great  number of Azerbaijani soldiers.</p>

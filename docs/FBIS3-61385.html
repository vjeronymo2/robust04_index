			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Statement of the Social Democratic Party of Moldova </F> National Coordinating Council: "Danger of the Undermining of the  National Privatization Process"]    [Text] Since the moment it was formed the SDPM [Social  Democratic Party of Moldova] has been guided by the principle  according to which the endowment of the citizens of Moldova with  private property has been the main guarantor of the  irreversibility of the democratization of society, and the very  mechanism of privatization shapes its social structure.    Proceeding from this, the SDPM proposed in the spring of  1991  the alternative draft law "Privatization" providing for its  realization for registered public property vouchers with the  participation of all citizens of Moldova. The law  adopted by parliament in June of the same year contains all the  basic provisions of the bill proposed by the social democrats.  It was possible, therefore, to avoid the danger of the  mafia-type privatization of public property for money.    As the process of privatization approached the practical  implementation stage, resistance on the part of both the  opponents of economic reform and those who are attempting to  hand over the people's property to a small group of "moneybags"  has grown increasingly openly.    A method of the direct robbery of broad strata of the  citizens of Moldova via deprivation of their right to real  participation in privatization is the displacement of vouchers  from this process.    Back at the start of 1992 the V. Muravschi government, with  the support of certain parliamentary circles, blocked the  adoption of the State Privatization Program for a whole 14  months. Subsequently, in the process of its adoption in  parliament in 1993, the opponents of public privatization sought  revisions to it palpably limiting the possibilities of  privatization for vouchers. While paying lip service to the  concept of public privatization, the A. Sangheli government in  practice blocked its practical implementation.    Thus the allocation of funds for the preparation of public  property vouchers and their processing and issue to the citizens  has been impeded in every possible way. The list of facilities  of incomplete construction authorized by legislation for  privatization for cash has not been extended. The issue of  vouchers to retirees has been blocked thus far. In a whole  number of localities the authorities are putting obstacles in  the way of properties subject to privatization being put up for  auction. The so-called State Property Fund--one further  bureaucratic structure designed to torpedo in practice  privatization for vouchers--was created beneath the signboard of  protection of the property interests of the Republic of Moldova.    Finally, the opponents of public privatization have openly  gone against their own people, seeking with the assistance of  the Ministry of Economics and the above-mentioned Fund the  adoption on 29 November 1993 by the Committee for Monetary  Reform of a decision on the unrestricted use in the  privatization process of the Moldavian lei and convertible  currency together with public property vouchers, without  limitation of the spheres of their circulation.    The SDPM has already observed that because of the continuing  decline in production and the absence of the requisite commodity  backing the Moldavian lei faces the threat of rapid  depreciation. The organizers of such monetary reform,  endeavoring to conceal the deplorable results of the policy they  are pursuing, have taken an unprecedented step--a cardinal  change in the essence of privatization in Moldova and the  emasculation of its social focus.    In making possible the displacement of the voucher by  money the present government is condemning it to devaluation and  creating obviously unequal opportunities for the participation  in the privatization process of millions of citizens. Public  property is in fact being handed over to several corrupt  clans.    As a result of the above-mentioned step Moldova's production  potential will in a short space of time have been grabbed by  criminal capital, and the citizens will have been deprived  forever of the right to own property created by their labor. The  buying up for a pittance of the public property vouchers and  their exchange for large blocks of shares will impede for a long  term the creation of a securities market--a practical measure  under Moldova's conditions en route to the strengthening of the  national currency.    In the version that is being imposed on us privatization  will  be undertaken by a narrow stratum of "moneybags," and the  process of Moldova's economic recovery will drag on for decades,  demanding increasingly new foreign loans, for which our children  and grandchildren will have to pay.    The SDPM declares that under the conditions of the total  lack  of control on the part of the paralyzed legislative body the  government is directly violating current legislation. The mere  fact of the use of wording of the "with subsequent confirmation  by the Parliament of the Republic of Moldova" type testifies  that the present government has gambled on avowedly antireform  political forces coming to power on 27 February 1994.    The SDPM appeals to the president of the Republic of Moldova  for the reversal of the antipopular decisions depriving all of  us of the right to property.    The SDPM calls on the unions of the Republic of Moldova to  come to the defense of their members' real interests.    [Dated] 2 December 1993, Chisinau</p>

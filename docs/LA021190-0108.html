			<p><P> February 11, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> AUSTRIA-HUNGARY PAST MAY SIGNAL FUTURE  </P> <P> Some Eastern European countries may have to go a century back in time to find a  geopolitical model to help pull them out of the economic shambles left by the  collapsing communist system.  </P> <P> So says Thibaut de Saint Phalle, financial lawyer, author and World War II  veteran who has spent much of his life making his way through the maze of  international finance.  </P> <P> De Saint Phalle is circulating the idea that what Eastern Europeans need, now  that Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is allowing them to move toward  free-market economies, is a system similar to the Austro-Hungarian Empire,  which resulted in almost 50 years of peace until World War I.  </P> <P> This will become particularly necessary, he said, if and when West and East  Germany reunite and again become a powerful economic force in Europe.  </P> <P> "It seems highly likely that sooner or later the Germanys will get together  again," he said. "If I were secretary of state, I would be terribly excited  about recreating in southeastern Europe a strong economic and political bloc to  keep the Germans from expanding eastward."  </P> <P> The dual Austro-Hungarian monarchy, with the emperor of Austria doubling as  king of Hungary, was established in 1867 and was a stable power in southeastern  Europe until it was dismembered at the end of World War I.  </P> <P> In the process Hungary lost regions to neighboring states -- Transylvania to  Romania, Croatia and Bacska to Yugoslavia, Slovakia and Carpatho-Ruthenia to  Czechoslovakia.  </P> <P> De Saint Phalle envisions an economic federation between Austria, Hungary,  Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia, with links to Romania and Poland, able to trade  both with Western Europe and the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> They would again use Trieste, a Yugoslav city at the northern end of the  Adriatic Sea, as the principal port.  </P> <P> "It's interesting because lately there have been political discussions and  certainly all sorts of tentative economic agreements between Austria and  Hungary on the one hand and more recently between parts of Czechoslovakia,  Hungary, Austria, parts of Yugoslavia, and Italy," he said.  </P> <P> "The idea is 'Let's reinstitute that port, which would serve as the exporting  center for this whole region of Eastern Europe.' "  </P> <P> De Saint Phalle, who is writing a book forecasting the state of Europe in 1992,  also said bureaucrats in the U.S. government are spending too much time  worrying about what effect Western Europe will have on the United States in  1992 when the European Economic Community becomes an integrated trading bloc.  </P> <P> "I think they ought to spend a lot more time worrying about what is going to  happen in Eastern Europe. How do we try to help avoid what happened in the days  from 1870 to 1945 when the Germans were creating all these problems? Let's make  sure they're not in a position to create problems again."  </P> <P> Assuming Gorbachev's reform program does not collapse, the Soviet Union should  not interfere with such a federation as long as it proceeds slowly and bases  its decisions on economic reasons, not political or military ones, De Saint  Phalle believes.  </P> <P> "It will go as fast as it's meant to go, but we can give it a push from time to  time. We can say to the American businessman, 'Go and invest, become part of  the groups, work with these people, encourage them,' " he said.  </P> <P> Already American businesses are attempting to invest nearly $2 billion in  Poland and Hungary through the Overseas Private Investment Corp. (OPIC), and  officials expect Congress soon to authorize investment in other nations in  Eastern Europe.  </P> <P> Such investments are one way to tap into the Western European market after  1992.  </P> <P> "If they can invest in Eastern Europe, they can manufacture things there and  export them to Western Europe," said Jim Hall of OPIC. "Not only is Eastern  Europe a huge, untapped market, but they can also sell competitively in Western  Europe."  </P></p>

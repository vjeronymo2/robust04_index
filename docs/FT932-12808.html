			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / The City Bombing: Japanese banks undeterred by damage JAPANESE banks in London yesterday said they would not be deterred from doing business in the City as a result of the weekend bomb, despite severe damage to the offices of two leading Japanese institutions. Tokai Bank, the largest in Japan, had four floors in the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank tower, one of the buildings most severely damaged in the blast. 'London is an international finance centre and doing business there is necessary,' Tokai said. 'The bomb doesn't damage that image, but the risk is increasing. We will have to consider how to reduce the risks for our operations.' The Long Term Credit Bank of Japan, one of a small group of long-term financing institutions, was also forced out by the bomb, and has moved into temporary accommodation with two other Japanese banks, Mitsubishi and Daichi Europe. Other Japanese institutions hit by the two City bombs over the last year include Mitsubishi Corporation Finance, the financing arm of the Mitsubishi trading group, whose office was devastated over the weekend, and Sanwa Bank, which was forced out of offices in the Commercial Union building last year. The general reaction from Japanese financial institutions was that they must maintain a presence in London regardless of the risk. But the blast comes as many of these institutions, still troubled by bad loans at home, are reviewing or trimming international operations. Japanese securities houses have cut expatriate staff in London as part of general shifting of resources out of Europe to take advantage of higher growth in Asia. A brokerage official said terrorism in London was one more reason to send fewer Japanese expatriate staff, but would not of itself prompt the company to bring staff home. 'Japanese know that the IRA has exploded bombs in the past, but the attacks on the City give us a different feeling. We wonder why they are attacking financial targets, and it does make us feel a bit uneasy,' the broker said. The Bank of Tokyo ordered a security assessment before a recent move to new London premises, which were unaffected by the explosion. The latest incident appears to have confirmed the wisdom of the assessment. Mitsubishi Bank will review the security of its offices in London, which were not damaged. Sumitomo Bank, another leading Japanese institution, said: 'We are gathering information and will consider what action should be taken.'</p>

			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / International Company News: Topdanmark returns to profit Topdanmark, the Danish insurance group, returned to profit of DKr107m (Dollars 16m) in 1993 after losing DKr53m in 1992 and DKr273m in 1991. A dividend of DKr10 was proposed for 1993. No dividend was paid for 1992. The return to profit was due primarily to gains on securities in the buoyant Danish bond and share market last year. Capital gains soared to DKr348m, from DKr58m in 1992. There was an operating loss of DKr274m following on losses of DKr111m in 1992 and DKr347m in 1991. The insurance divisions made a profit on insurance operations of DKr107m compared with a 1992 loss of DKr50m. But after capital income profit increased to DKr372m from DKr192m in 1992. Total premium income was unchanged at DKr3.2bn. Administration costs were cut to DKr715m from DKr808m. Group equity capital at the end of last year was DKr2.53bn, up by DKr100m from 1992. Total assets increased to DKr30.07bn fro DKr28.72bn. The Lauritzen shipping and shipbuilding group moved into deficit of DKr171m (Dollars 25.5m) last year after making a net profit of DKr83m in 1992. The group blamed weak markets for gas tankers, drilling rigs, bulk tankers and refrigerated cargo vessels for the poor performance. It added that the European Union's imposition of quotas on bananas imported from South America and tariffs on fruit from Argentina and Chile had an adverse effect on the result of its refrigerated cargo operations. Group sales slipped to DKr13.48bn from DKr13.96bn. There was a loss of DKr153m after net financial items compared with a 1992 profit of DKr146m. There was an extraordinary DKr110m write-down of the value of drilling rigs and only DKr8m income from the sale of ships. The parent company, Lauritzen Holding, will pay no dividend for 1993, the group said.</p>

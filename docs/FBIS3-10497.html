			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Bahia State Governor Antonio </F> Carlos Magalhaes by Tales Faria in Salvador; date not given]    [Text] [Faria] How does the pre-electoral picture look to  you?    [Magalhaes] I find it quite undefined because there is still  only a single known candidate: Lula [Inacio Lula Da Silva] of  the PT [Workers Party]. Since he never captures more than  one-third of the electorate, it does not seem he will be elected  by a majority. The country is trying to find a solution without  Lula. But those who think like that have not yet found the road.  It is a difficult road to find not only because there are many  parties fighting for leadership but also because there are many  interests and personal problems.    [Faria] During the national PFL [Liberal Front Party]  meeting, part of the party wanted to launch your presidential  candidacy. But you found a way to stop it. Why?    [Magalhaes] It would be hasty. First of all, the party must  finish its government program. If Brazil is in a bad state of  mismanagement, it is up to the PFL to show the country the  excessive size of the state and the bad use of public  administration. The party can do that even in alliance with  other organizations if the essential part of the program we are  drawing up is maintained. An alliance in the first round may be  the best solution, not only for the party but also for the  country. The PFL could make alliances with almost all parties.  Any party making alliances should not be prejudiced. It should  not exclude anyone.    [Faria] But the noticeable aspect of the PFL national  meeting  was the great interest in an alliance with the PSDB [Brazilian  Social Democracy Party].    [Magalhaes] The truth is local problems have great influence  on parties in making alliances. I believe local problems will  not hurt an important national alliance. The PSDB is a party  that has leaders with whom an alliance is possible. For example,  Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Governor Ciro Gomes  (Ceara), PSDB President Tasso Jereissati, and party leaders  Mario Covas (Senate) and Jose Serra (Chamber of Deputies) are  very good men. In the case of Fernando Henrique Cardoso, he  obviously has a good image in the media despite the 40 percent  monthly inflation rate. I believe if inflation is not defeated,  his candidacy will not hold. But if inflation is defeated, he  will be a strong presidential candidate in any alliance.    [Faria] Do you believe the minister's economic plan can  defeat inflation?    [Magalhaes] That plan is better than nothing, but it will  only be good if it is made to last. The truth is that the plan  came too late; it should have been presented before. The date 28  February is dangerous because it marks the launching of the  Cruzado Plan. The new plan cannot have the false promises of the  Cruzado Plan, which became an electoral plan. It must be lasting  and aimed at carrying out a profound state reform. But I have  confidence that the minister and his economists will not deceive  the nation and that they have a good chance to succeed. This is  possible because there are now favorable international  conditions that did not exist when the Cruzado Plan was  implemented.    [Faria] You seem to have some enthusiasm for Cardoso and not  for Prefect Paulo Maluf, who advocates an alliance between the  PFL and the PPR [Progressive Renewal Party].    [Magalhaes] I have no prejudice about names. I had a meeting  with him the other day, and he would not be an obstacle to any  kind of contacts. But I do not have to launch his name. I know  he has some frictions with the PFL that might or might not  disappear, depending on his work with our party members and on  the changes made in Sao Paulo Prefecture. Maluf still has to  present an administrative program for Sao Paulo to have the  nation trust his reputation as a good administrator. He may  succeed if he spends more time on his administration and less on  politics.    [Faria] Does an alliance include the PMDB [Brazilian  Democratic Movement Party] of [former Sao Paulo Governor  Orestes] Quercia?    [Magalhaes] I do not exclude the PMDB of any other leader.  The PMDB currently is very divided and an alliance would be  better with leaders that unite. According to what I read, Deputy  Antonio Britto (PMDB-RS [Rio Grande do Sul]) is the leader who  unites better. But also according to what I read, Britto only  plans to run for governor of Rio Grande do Sul. Well, I am not  going to get involved in the PMDB's internal affairs. The party  leaders can resolve their internal problems, and we will be open  to an alliance without excluding any names.    [Faria] The PFL's total opening sometimes causes surprise.  Like the contact promoted by PFL Senate leader Marco Maciel (PE  [Pernambuco]) with [Rio de Janeiro] Governor Leonel Brizola. I  believe an alliance with Brizola is practically impossible.    [Magalhaes] I also believe that. Even with the ability of  Senator Marco Maciel, I find it very difficult to reach an  alliance. But I would like to reiterate that I am against  excluding anyone.    [Faria] In other words, you support the theory of the  government leader in the Senate, Pedro Simon (PMDB-RS), that a  broad anti-Lula alliance should be made.    [Magalhaes] I am against a special alliance against  anything.  Brazil does not like the "anti." In Bahia I grew stronger as my  adversaries became anti-Magalhaes.    [Faria] What would be your electoral support in that  framework?    [Magalhaes] I am only talking about Bahia. My situation in  my  state is quite reasonable. It is a strong state in the national  context with an electorate of 7 million people. I believe the  presidential succession will depend on Bahia, and I will do as  much as I can to have my party contribute to finding the best  solution for Brazil, either with my name in front or somebody  else's name. What I want is for the country to come out of the  current situation.    [Faria] We are getting into the constitutional amendments.  Do  you support the reelection of the president and governors, and  the reduction of the deadline for a candidate to leave his post  to run for another office?    [Magalhaes] I hope to run for a seat in the Senate for  Bahia.  But if there is reelection, I will be a candidate for governor  again with a great chance to win. But I do not believe Congress  would approve reelection for the current governors. Regarding  the reduction of the deadline to leave a post to run for another  office, I would be a hypocrite if I said I oppose it. But I am  not fighting for it; I would be satisfied if I had three or four  more months to run my state. At any rate, I am getting ready to  leave on 30 March. I believe the other governors think the same  way.</p>

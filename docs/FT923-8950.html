			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / World Trade News: EC trade partners reject offer over oilseeds subsidies TRADING partners of the EC have rejected a new offer to compensate them for Community subsidies to oilseeds farmers, diplomats said, Reuter reports from Geneva. 'We told them their proposal was insufficient,' one delegate added. The EC held bilateral meetings on Tuesday, Wednesday and yesterday to present a new compensation offer to the 10 nations judged affected by its oilseeds subsidies. Each turned it down, diplomats said. Details of the EC's new proposal were sketchy. One diplomat said it had talked about added concessions on beef imports and perhaps maize, 'but we judged the value insufficient'. Other countries say the EC has limited their access to the Community market because subsidised European farmers are able to compete unfairly against their products. The issue has been a trade irritant, especially with the US. Farm subsidy rows have blocked a successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round trade talks. Nations involved in the dispute are Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Hungary, India, Pakistan, Poland, Sweden, the US and Uruguay. The US wants it settled by August 18, threatening import tariffs on Dollars 1bn-worth of EC farm products.</p>

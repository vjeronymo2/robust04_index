			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family: Take care when you pick a pensions adviser - Independence does not always mean expertise / A look at the pitfalls to avoid The complexity of company schemes and individual contracts makes it virtually impossible and certainly unwise for non- professionals to take a D-I-Y approach to pension planning. Good independent advice is essential and it will not come free. Nor will it be easy to find. Essentially there are just two types of adviser: those who represent and are authorised to sell the products of only one company; and independent financial advisers (IFAs) who are supposed to select the best product on the market to suit your needs. IFAs vary in their level of competence. They also vary in the way they are remunerated. Some work solely on a commission basis paid by providers on the sale of products. Others are fee-based and are paid directly by the client. Yet others take part of the commission from the provider and charge a reduced fee for each sale. And then there is a growing number who will operate on a commission or a fee-basis depending on the client's preference: if you want to pay a fee, that's fine but if you want to pay by commission that's fine too. Helpful, perhaps. Confusing, certainly. If you end up paying commission, the most flexible method is to pay a series of one-off 'single premium' contributions since this avoids the heavy up-front commissions and related early termination penalties associated with regular premium contracts. In theory, fee-based advice should be clean and simple. You should know exactly what you are paying and the adviser's remuneration is not linked to the sale of a product. How you pay How you pay your fees should also be clean and simple but even here the life and pensions industry has managed to build in layers of confusion. Many advisers who accept work on a fee basis recommend that the fee, once agreed, is deducted from the commission paid by the provider. In theory this has certain tax advantages. For example, you avoid paying VAT on the fee since the adviser receives it in the form of commission from the provider. In the case of pension products, you also receive tax relief on the payment because it is derived from your pension contributions which are themselves subject to tax relief. Where the commission paid is worth more than the agreed fee, the excess is either reinvested in the plan or used to reduce the provider's charges. However, you may end up paying more in commission than you intended, since the adviser will earn extra 'renewal' commission each year and 'incremental' commission when you increase contributions. Moreover, even if the initial commission has been reinvested, the provider often leaves the early surrender and transfer penalties in place, so check this with your adviser. How much? Fee based advisers charge anything from Pounds 30 to Pounds 200 per hour depending on whether you go to a local high street adviser or a leading firm of consulting actuaries. For a simple case such as the purchase of a personal pension you should expect to pay a minimum of Pounds 250 to Pounds 400. Complex cases will cost more. If you are only interested in a simple purchase then it is worth asking what the expected total will be. However, you should also find out what future charges will be incurred if you need to change your arrangement. How to find a fee-based adviser A good way to find a fee based adviser is to use the register run by Money Management, the FT's monthly trade magazine for the financial services industry. The register provides a database of 750 independent financial advisers, some of whom only work for fees and some of whom operate primarily on a commission basis but are prepared to negotiate a fee. When you contact the register you will be sent details of six firms in your postcode area. To get your list, telephone 0272 769444 and be prepared to give your address including postcode and explain what type of advice you want. The specialisations offered include: life assurance; company pensions; regular savings schemes; unit and investment trusts; mortgages; personal pensions; health insurance; lump sum capital investment; and tax and estate planning. A Freepost address is available for written requests.* The register information is supplied free (apart from the cost of the phone call which is charged at normal rates) and no salesmen will call as a result of your enquiry. Selecting your adviser Once you have your list of contacts, you need to select the most appropriate for your needs. The register checks that the firm is independent and authorised to conduct business but it is important to appreciate that fee-based advice is not synonymous with expert advice. You should ask the following questions: How long has the firm been trading? How long has it offered specialist pensions advice? (If it is a large firm, does it have a dedicated pensions department?) How many people can provide skilled pensions advice? What qualifications do they have and how senior are they? Can the firm provide tax planning services? (Pensions and tax interrelate, so this is important.) Can it provide a portfolio management service? (You may not need this if you already have your own stockbroker.) How many pensions clients does it have? How many clients in total? How many offices? If your adviser is away, who will look after your business? Does the adviser handle client cash? What criteria does it use to select a pension provider? What research resources does it use? Are these in-house or external? Does the firm provide regular updates on client accounts and / or regular newsletters? How much will the advice cost? Eg fees per hour / case?

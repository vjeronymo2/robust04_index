			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / International Company News: Hennes and Mauritz surges HENNES and Mauritz, the largest Swedish clothing retailer, achieved 67 per cent growth in profits for the first six months of the year, writes Robert Taylor. Profits rose to SKr358.6m (Dollars 63m) from SKr214.7m in the 1991 period. Turnover rose by 18 per cent to SKr4.340bn from SKr3.678bn, with sales outside Sweden responsible for 53 per cent of that improvement. The retailer's success partly stems from expansion outside Sweden, particularly in Switzerland, Britain and Germany. This summer, it plans to open three stores in Belgium, with a total of 15 new outlets in Europe by the end of the year. The company's shares have risen faster there than any other listed company. Last year it enjoyed 87 per cent growth in profits to SKr619m.</p>

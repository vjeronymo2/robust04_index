			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Emerging Markets: Seoul may delay ceiling rise The good news is that Seoul's general index this year is likely to exceed its all-time record high in spite of nuclear tensions and the recent death of the North Korean President Kim Young-sam, writes John Burton in Seoul. However, the bad news is that the rise in share prices may persuade the Seoul government, worried about an overheated market, to delay a proposed increase of the 10 per cent ceiling on foreign shareholdings, which has been largely filled. Most analysts forecast that the market will break its record high of 1,007, set in April 1989, within the next few months and approach the 1,100 level by the year end. The market's strength has been helped by a robust economy and the prospect of increased corporate earnings - GNP is expected to grow by 8 per cent following strong exports caused by the weakness of the Korean won against the Japanese yen, and a consequent increase in facility investments to meet the increased global demand for Korean cars, ships and semiconductors. The only economic worry is inflation, which could reach 6 per cent by the end of the year. But foreign investors are hampered in enjoying the full benefits due to the 10 per cent cap on foreign shareholdings in listed companies. The government is reluctant to raise the foreign ceiling immediately because it fears that the inflow of capital from abroad could stoke inflationary pressure. Instead it has promised to raise the investment limit by an unspecified amount by the end of 1995. The finance ministry also suggested last month that it would accelerate the schedule by raising the ceiling in gradual stages to 15 per cent by mid-1995.</p>

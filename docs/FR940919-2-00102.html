			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As an independent factfinder in a nonadversarial proceeding, the ALJ will still have a role in protecting both SSA interests and the claimant <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> s interests, particularly when the claimant is unrepresented. However, an improved initial determination process with its focus on early and comprehensive evidentiary development, predecision notices and opportunity for personal interviews, fully rationalized initial decisions, and prehearing analysis of contested issues should ensure that the Agency position is fully explored and presented to the ALJ. Moreover, the primary burden of compiling an evidentiary record will be shifted to the representative_if one is appointed_or to the claimant (when able to do so), with assistance (when necessary) from SSA personnel. This will permit the ALJ, in most circumstances, to close the record at the conclusion of the oral hearing, deliberate on the issues, and render prompt decisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In making disability decisions, ALJs will rely on the same standards for decisionmaking that are used by the disability claim managers and adjudication officers. Adjudication officers and other decision writers will assist ALJs in preparing hearing decisions, using the same decision support system that supports the preparation of initial disability determinations. A simplified disability decisional methodology, in conjunction with the use of prehearing stipulations that frame the issues in dispute, will result in shorter, more focused hearing decisions. If the ALJ issues a favorable decision, he or she will refer the claim to a disability claim manager to effectuate payment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Final Decision of the Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the new process, if a claimant is dissatisfied with the ALJ's decision, the claimant's next level of appeal will be to Federal district court. A claimant's request for Appeals Council review will no longer be a prerequisite to seeking judicial review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As under the current process, the Appeals Council will continue to have a role in ensuring that claims subject to judicial review have properly prepared records and that the Federal courts only consider claims where appellate review is warranted. Accordingly, the Appeals Council, working with Agency counsel, will evaluate all claims in which a civil action has been filed and decide, within a fixed time limit whether it wishes to defend the ALJ's decision as the final decision of the Secretary. If the Appeals Council reviews a claim on its own motion, it will seek voluntary remand from the court for the purpose of affirming, reversing or remanding the ALJ's decision. The Secretary's authority for seeking voluntary remand prior to the Secretary's filing of an answer to the civil action is currently provided for in &sect;205(g) of the Act. Favorable Appeals Council decisions will be returned to the disability claim manager to effectuate payment. The number of civil actions requiring substantive action by the Appeals Council will be relatively small because, in the new process, ALJ decisions will be the result of a fully developed evidentiary record where the factual and legal issues have been focused for final resolution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, the Appeals Council will have a role in a comprehensive quality assurance system. As part of the in-line review component of this system, which is described in greater detail below, the Appeals Council will conduct its own motion reviews of ALJ decisions (both allowances and denials) and dismissals prior to effectuation. If the Appeals Council decides to review a claim on its own motion, the Appeals Council may affirm, reverse or remand the ALJ's decision, or vacate the dismissal. The Appeals Council's review will be limited to the record that was before the ALJ.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency will establish appropriate mechanisms to respond to claimant allegations of ALJ misconduct or bias. To the extent that the allegations of ALJ misconduct may affect the final decision in a claim, the Agency will consider whether an appropriate mechanism includes some form of final Agency review at the claimant's request.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Quality Assurance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> System of Agency Accountability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> SSA will be accountable to the public, the ultimate judge of the quality of SSA service, and will strive to consistently meet or exceed the public's expectations. SSA will have a comprehensive quality assurance program that defines its quality standards, continually communicates them to employees in a clear and consistent manner, and provides employees with the means to achieve them.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The quality assurance program will have three primary components: 1) substantial resources to ensure that the right decision is made the first time; 2) comprehensive and systematic reviews of the quality of the decisionmaking process at all levels; and 3) measures of customer satisfaction against the SSA standards for service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Investment in Employees  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> SSA's ability to ensure that the right decision is made the first time depends on a well-trained, skilled, and highly motivated workforce that has the program tools and technological support to issue quality decisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SSA will make an investment in comprehensive employee training to ensure that all employees have the necessary knowledge and skills to perform the duties of their positions. SSA will develop national training programs for initial job training and orientation as well as continuing education to maintain job knowledge and skills. Such training will include general communication skills and how to deal effectively with the public generally, and disability claimants in particular. National training programs will also address changes to program policy. Consistent program policy training will be provided to disability decisionmakers at all levels of the process.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

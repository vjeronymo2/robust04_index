			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: US active as Steel falls again ANOTHER session of heavy turnover in British Steel saw the shares continue to weaken as worries over the group's dividend and trading prospects persisted following the announcement on Monday of sharp cuts in production. Turnover reached more than 45m shares, by far the largest traded share of the day, with one leading US investment bank said to have bought a block of 21.5m shares at 51p and to have placed 13m of these at 52p a share within minutes. There were suggestions in the market that the bulk of the selling had come from disenchanted US investors, who own about a quarter of the British Steel equity and that this could mark the beginning of the end of their love affair with the UK group. New York has been the chief buyer of Steel shares in recent months as worried British investors have been bailing out. The implications of any sustained US unloading for the Steel share price would, said one analyst, be 'catastrophic - Steel would be sold down to 20p.' However, the US fears were dismissed by others in the market, who pointed out that the 30m shares equivalent sold in New York on Monday after London had closed had indicated strong two-way activity. It was also suggested that yesterday's large trade involved selling from a combination of both US and UK institutions. Steel shares closed 3 1/2 lighter at 52 1/2 p. Reed strong Magazine publisher Reed International was a strong market ahead of the announcement of first-half figures tomorrow and also on favourable comments from two securities houses. The shares held up against the market's early weakness and closed 5 firmer on the day at 586p. Analysts are looking for profits of between Pounds 85m and Pounds 92m against Pounds 85.3m last year and expect the group to announce the exact terms of its planned merger with Dutch group Elsevier. Meanwhile, BZW has put Reed back on its buy list, citing the group's long-term potential to exploit benefits of scale, boost its strategic position and produce above-average dividend and earnings growth. Also, Lehman Brothers argues that the group is poised to offer 'solid profit recovery in the short term and continued growth in revenues cash flow and earnings over the longer term'. Drug stocks busy Internationally traded pharmaceuticals benefited from the strength of the dollar against sterling and also from analysts' recommendations. Glaxo was the principal gainer, with Hoare Govett telling clients that the shares had unjustifiably lagged Wellcome's. Strauss Turnbull was also reinforcing its positive stance and preparing an enthusiastic note on the sector. Glaxo shares stood out against the falling market in the morning and represented much of the strength in the FT-SE 100 index at the close. The net rise of 19 to 803p represented 3.7 points of the Footsie's 8.2-point rise. Wellcome eased 9 to 1000p as buyers stayed away ahead of today's figures, but SmithKline Beecham lifted 8 in the 'A's and 11 in the Units. BAT Industries fell 17 to 875p as another broker decided that the shares were overpriced. Shell continued to regain some of the ground lost last week, edging up a further 3 to 536p on 3.3m. The recent bout of profit-taking in Lasmo, which is thought to have seen a line of 2m shares on offer and subsequently mostly absorbed by the market, saw the stock ease 4 more to 178p. HSBC maintained its position as the most active of the leading banks with turnover reaching 12m shares. The stock price ran ahead strongly, closing a net 19 higher at 504p, a penny short of its 1992 high, with big buyers in Hong Kong said to have chased the shares up as the local market continued its recovery. BZW was said to have been behind the good showing by Lloyds, which moved up 7 to 460p, albeit in rather thin turnover of 1.6m. The UK investment bank was said to have recommended a switch out of NatWest and into Lloyds. NatWest shares fell sharply early in the session, slipping off to 373p, but later rallied strongly to end a net 4 up at 383p in turnover of 3.6m. Barclays Bank drifted off 3 to 342p with many banking specialists still fretting over the possibility of a dividend cut after the bank has accounted for the ever-growing list of bad debts and property losses. TSB, still unsettled by the steep profits downgrade carried out by Smith New Court, now thought to be the lowest current year forecast in the market, fell 2 more to 140p. Life assurance stocks performed well, with the exception of Prudential which could manage only a minor improvement at 282p after Kleinwort Benson told its clients to reduce overweight holdings in the stock. Transatlantic, which encompasses the former Sun Life business, rose 15 to 204p. Turnover began to pick up in the composite insurers with Guardian Royal exceptionally busy on 5.6m shares traded and finally a shade better at 160p. A buy recommendation on the insurance broking sector, said to have been published by BZW, boosted JIB 14 to 161p and Lloyd Thompson 9 to 223p. MicroFocus jumped 72 to 2340p in the wake of a buy recommendation published by SG Warburg Securities, the company's stockbroker. Warburg said MicroFocus can continue to achieve 25 per cent-plus annual dollar earnings per share growth, that the shares remain undervalued versus US software companies, the Standard &amp; Poors 500 index, UK growth companies and the FT Industrial and 500 share indices. Racal Electronics rose 4 to 159p after the group announced its Racal Survey division had won a contract worth a potential Pounds 1m year from Shell UK. Graseby, formerly Cambridge Electronic Industries, dropped 11 to 146p following hints that the company's stockbroker, Cazenove, had downgraded its estimates. Recent hints that the Government may well sell its remaining 21.8 per cent holding in BT as soon as it is permitted (after the the payment of the third installment of the second tranche of BT shares due in March 1993) brought pressure to bear on BT shares. Both the 'old' and 'new' stock slipped 1 1/2 to 369 1/2 p and 264 1/2 p. Downgrades were reported in Glynwed, with Albert E Sharpe, the Birmingham stockbroker, believed to have reduced its profits estimates. The shares lost 7 to 206p. IMI was also said to have suffered at the hands of James Capel, the shares retreating 4 to 230p. Boots were the biggest casualty in the stores sector, the shares retreating 11 to 471p, on vague rumours of a pre-Christmas price war in the toiletries market. US buyers were said to be preferring Grand Metropolitan, a penny firmer at 399p, ahead of Pepsico. Cadbury-Schweppes moved forward smartly as Nomura decided that its recent underperformance made it look attractive on a 3-month view. The shares rose 5 to 460p. US buyers were said to be behind Kwik Save's advance of 14 1/2 to 734 1/2 p. UBS Phillips and Drew renewed its buy stance on Northern Foods, the shares rising 6 to 263p. Publishing conglomerate Pearson slipped 5 to 373p. The group's provincial newspaper arm Westminster Press is hosting a large meeting with analysts tomorrow.

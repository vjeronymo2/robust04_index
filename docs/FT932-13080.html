			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / Arts: The RA'S white knight steps down - Simon Tait talks to Roger de Grey, 75 this week HIS name makes him sound like a knight in Murder in the Cathedra1, ritually hacking away at the Becket metaphor for innovation and change, but Sir Roger de Grey is not that. On the contrary, he is a modern-minded traditionalist who abhors conflict. This week he was 75 and, according to the rules of the Royal Academy of Arts of which he has been president since 1984, he must retire in December. According to Tom Phillips, who could succeed him, he has completed the institution's transition from a gentleman's club for old artists to one of the worlds' great exhibition centres and brought to the membership a contemporary relevance missing for at least a century. De Grey has won over the likes of Hockney and Kitaj, who had thought the place an irrelevance; he has encouraged innovators like Peter Blake; and he has invited non-members to exhibit. He abolished the Associateship, an apprenticeship which many accomplished artists found offensive. He probably saved the place from closure; and he certainly preserved one of the Academy's founding pillars, the Summer Exhibition, and restored the reputation of the other, the Academy Schools. De Grey looks anything but the sinister eminence grise his name conjures: a slight figure clad in jacket, slacks, button-down shirt and knitted silk tie in colours reminiscent of the gentle French Cezannesque landscapes he paints. He is a doughty combatant for his students, and will continue as principal of the City and Guilds art school. The history of the Academy is full of schisms, rows and cabals. Constable and Gainsborough both withdrew from the Summer Exhibition; Spencer, Sickert and John all resigned; and in 1990 Caro refused to join. The biggest presidential row was in 1949, caused by Alfred Munnings's refusal to accept that Picasso, Matisse and Moore were worth consideration. Tom Monnington's ten-year presidency which ended in 1976 began the rehabilitation which was continued by the ebullient Hugh Casson. But Casson was an architect, and it needed a painter to bring the painters across. For 20 years de Grey had taught at the Royal College of Art, and was part of the RCA underground in the 1950s and '60s which wanted to reform the Academy. Treasurer throughout Casson's presidency, there was no surprise when he was elected on Casson's retirement. Still, he did not really want to be president. 'I'd never had a job where I had to be a public figure, and this was a job in which you had to be one. If you couldn't become one you'd failed. I said 'I'm not a speaker, I'll just say what I think', and I did. Sometimes it works.' The principal anxiety was how to keep the Academy open all year, and his solution has been his single most visible contribution - the Sackler Galleries. The Royal Academy has no grant and its loan exhibitions were becoming its main source of income. But owners of important pictures were increasingly conservation conscious, and by 1988 the state of the air conditioning in the galleries was putting them off. The rarely used Diploma Galleries were the obvious place to start and he launched the academy into a massive Pounds l0 million scheme to join the RA's two separate buildings together, nullify the Victorian incursions and introduce modern atmospheric controls, display space and access in architect Norman Foster's prize-winning design. De Grey got sponsorship after chatting to the millionaire Arthur Sackler on a bus between New York and Philadelphia. There was not universal approval, but winning this year's RlBA architecture award was a vindication and there is a new appeal for Pounds 7.8m to update the main galleries. There is plenty of ritual at the RA, not least with the selection of the Summer Exhibition which has just begun. De Grey saved the Summer Exhibition, which by 1977 had become a financial liability, by pushing through commission, 15 per cent at first and now up to 30 per cent, which provided essential income. But some RAs want the Summer Exhibition abandoned and replaced by an RAs' show because they are worried about their work getting lost among the 1,200 other works submitted; de Grey suggested having one alongside the Summer Show, a notion which threatened to become divisive and was dropped. Now Allen Jones has raised it again. That they can rationally discuss setting aside for the good of the art an institution enjoyed by upwards of 120,000 people each year, even temporarily, is owed to the white knight chairing the round table. 'Roger de Grey is simply the best president this century' said Tom Phillips.</p>

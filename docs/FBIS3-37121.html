He has long been the  supreme commander-in-chief, Shevardnadze's aide Teimuraz  Stepanov, who is currently in Moscow, told ITAR-TASS on Monday.    Stepanov believes that Shevardnadze has made this decision  in  order not to create new tension in society. Perhaps in  conditions of instability this is the only correct decision, the  aide added.</p>

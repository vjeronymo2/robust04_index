			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / Challenge to Vietnam over POWs GENERAL John Vessey, a special US emissary to Hanoi, will this week push Vietnam to confirm or deny a newly discovered secret report claiming that Hanoi held 1,205 US prisoners of war in 1972, more than double the number returned to the US at the end of the Vietnam war, writes Nancy Dunne in Washington. According to Izvestia newspaper, the document was discovered in a search of former Soviet archives. The prisoner of war issue has long prevented improved US-Vietnamese relations. The Clinton administration has been under pressure from business to renew relations with its former enemy now that it has opened its borders to investment and trade. Miss Dee Dee Myers, White House spokeswoman, said relations with Vietnam could not be normalised until the US was certain Vietnam was doing all it could to account for Americans missing during the war. Only 591 prisoners were released.</p>

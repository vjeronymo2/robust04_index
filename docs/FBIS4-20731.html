			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Dani Rubinstein: "The Masters of the West Bank </F> and Gaza"]    [Text] ] The government is going to have trouble taking any  kind of action against the extremist minority among the settlers  in the territories, because the settlers have long since become  the masters of the West Bank and Gaza. Something that happened  at the end of last week will serve as testimony: on Friday, a  delegation of Peace Now activists left for a visit to Hebron.  Because of the great tension in the city, which was under  curfew, the trip was carefully planned. Members of the movement  coordinated the date with the PLO leadership in Hebron, and  almost all the heads of the Arab community awaited them.  According to the organizers, they had been given a permit by the  military authorities. But the visit never took place. An IDF  (Israel Defense Forces) roadblock stopped the group outside Gush  Etzion, and the soldiers announced to its members that according  to the orders they had received they could not let them continue  on their way. The Peace Now activists had to give up the trip  and return to Jerusalem.    At the very same time, the settlers and their supporters  continued to pass the IDF roadblocks in the territories as  usual. Ever since the IDF authorized Baruch Goldstein's funeral  procession from Jerusalem to Kiryat Arba, you still see the  settlers roaming about Hebron in their way and receiving guests  who do not live there.    This is a familiar phenomenon. According to the defense  philosophy that has become established in the territories, not  only "the Arabs are the enemy," as Major General Sha'ul Mopaz  said before the commission of inquiry, but also anyone who does  not like the settlers--"anyone" meaning especially the activists  of Shalom Ahshav.    Why does this happen? Why does the IDF think that visits by  Israel left to Arabs in the territories are an intentional  provocation that must be averted, while practically any kind of  demonstration or other protest activity by the right and the  settlers is permissible? In contrast to the standing order to  block the way of Shalom Ahshav activists (this is not the first  time they have done this), innumerable examples can be brought  of activities by the right in the territories, which were  carried out with no problems. Anyone really aware of what goes  on in the West Bank and Gaza knows that there is just one group  of Israelis that the Israeli defense network there considers  even worse than Shalom Ahshav--the press. The left and the media  are suspected of links with the Arab enemy, and IDF commanders  do everything possible to keep them away from the West Bank or  Gaza.    This reality was created by the settlers, who over the years  have become integrated into the defense establishment in the  territories. Like the soldiers, the settlers, too, carry arms.  They maintain contacts with the army, get updates, receive and  give briefings, and come and go freely in most of the defense  installations in the territories. Many of them spent their army  service on bases in the territories, and fulfil support and  security functions along with units of the military government.    It would not be a great exaggeration to say that because of  these circumstances, they have become masters of the field. As  they view it, the army is in the West Bank and Gaza, first and  foremost, to serve them. In many ways, the settlers have managed  to turn the IDF into an apparatus that guards them not only from  the Arab enemy, but also from anyone suspected of aiding the  Arabs. At the top of the list, of course, are the left and the  hostile media. Even the [military] government's civilian  authority, meant to serve the needs of the Arabs in the  territories, is forced in many instances to accept the dictates  of the settlers.    Thus it happens that senior and junior officers who do not  get along with the settlers (that is, do not give in to their  demands) are denounced in the settlements and on the right as  leftists and are unable to go on serving in the West Bank and  Gaza. Maj. Gen. 'Amram Matzne'a, who dared one time to condemn  the actions of some settlers who made a retaliatory raid on the  Dehaisha camp and shot at Arab houses, barely managed to hold  onto his job after the leaders of the settlements demanded his  dismissal. Who knows, perhaps this episode put Gen. Matzne'a out  of the running later on for the position of chief of staff.    In contrast, no IDF commander's career has ever been harmed  because of things he said or did against the left in the  territories, or against the Arabs (unless he exaggerated, the  way Res. Gen. Yehuda Meir did during the episode where the Arab  youths arrested at Hav'ara were hit and had their bones broken  at the beginning of the intifadah). Everyone in the Israeli  defense establishment learned the main rule very quickly--not to  tangle with the settlers, or with the political lobby on the  right that supports them. The labor government, and Meretz, and  the peace process have not changed this reality at all.</p>

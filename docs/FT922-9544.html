			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (9): Opportunities for overseas players - Japan's rapidly ageing population will oblige funds to place greater emphasis on performance PENSION FUND management in Japan, traditionally the exclusive territory of Japanese life assurers and trust banks, is changing as the emphasis in fund management appointments shifts towards performance. The shift in attitudes is expected to provide opportunities for foreign companies, which have been unhappy with the limitations due to appointments ruled by the complex and cosy corporate networks. The recent appointment of Invesco MIM Asset Management, the Japanese arm of the UK asset management group, by Nagasakiya, a leading retail company, to manage a portion of its pension funds, came as a surprise to the industry. Foreign managers have only managed to win appointments from quasi-government organisations, and Nagasakiya became the first single private Japanese company to appoint a foreign-based fund manager. Nagasakiya indicated that it was dissatisfied with the returns of investments by trust banks, and allotted Y1bn of its Y23.7bn (Dollars 178m) pension fund to Invesco MIM. Foreign fund managers and more aggressive Japanese managers believe that the rapid ageing of the country's population will force company funds and the Japanese government to put more emphasis on performance. Other leading Japanese companies have also started to indicate interest in allowing foreign companies, which have more expertise in fund management. For those companies wishing to diversify their investments internationally, foreign fund asset managers are attractive, because foreign asset management companies are permitted to invest up to 70 per cent of assets overseas, compared with 50 per cent for domestic asset managers. The weakness of the Tokyo stock market has made Japanese companies wary of the deployment of funds. The uncertainty over Japanese share prices has made overseas investments all the more attractive. Last year, Japan's 1,400 pension fund schemes had Y38,500bn in assets. This figure is expected to hit Y161,000bn by the year 2000. Public pension funds and mutual aid programmes boasted another Y127,000bn. Foreign companies also hope that the government's own concern about the financial burden of expected demographic changes in Japan will stimulate further reforms of pension fund management. About 11 per cent of Japanese are now aged 65 or over, but the ratio is expected to jump to 16 per cent by 2000. Given such figures, the momentum for pension management reform is mounting. Asset management firms were allowed limited access to pension fund management in 1990. Investment advisers were permitted to manage only new pension contributions in portfolios with a minimum value of Y1bn and up to one third of total assets. The finance ministry responded to US pressure last year by allowing foreign affiliated asset managers to handle pension funds with as little as Y500m in assets and to hold up to 70 per cent in foreign investments. SG Warburg, Jardine Fleming and Fidelity were appointed to handle a fraction of the Pension Fund Association's own account, and part of the schoolteachers' fund was handed over to Jardine Fleming and Merrill Lynch. Foreign trust banks, which have been in the pension fund management business since 1985, now manage Y59bn, of which Y29bn is handled by Bankers Trust. Mr Noboru Terada, of the Pension Fund Association, says there is a change in attitude among Japanese companies towards appointing foreign managers. However, he points out that companies are still worried about the commitment the fund management company has made to Japan and the efficiency of administration and reporting procedures. Mr Haruaki Deguchi, at Nippon Life, Japan's largest life assurer, says that pension fund management will shift to be more 'western style' in the future. 'Japan's pension fund system is relatively new compared with that of Europe and the US. As the pension liabilities of companies start growing, managers will become more severe about investment returns,' he adds. Corporate pensions have usually been allotted to trust banks in the same keiretsu (corporate group), or to life assurers which in return would be buyers of the company's equity in times of fund raising. Until recently, trust banks held 65 per cent of the market, while life assurers held 35 per cent. Winning an appointment would be virtually impossible for a fund-managing company without such links. This arrangement has started to become a burden for the life insurers. The slump in share prices and low dividend payments has made long-term shareholdings unattractive investments. Mr Deguchi says that if companies start to base fund management relationships on performance, the nature of the funds will become more unstable. Selling life assurance policies, roughly 80 per cent of the total funds in the life assurance industry, will be the main focus of business, rather than pension fund management. However, changes in Japan do not happen overnight. Objective performance analysis of the industry has yet to be established, and performance data is not available to western consulting firms in Tokyo, including Intersec Research and Frank Russell. Once the growth in pension liabilities starts to affect a company's profits, the improvement of return on assets will become a more pressing matter for the companies. To wait for this to happen may require patience, because it could be at least another five to 10 years.</p>

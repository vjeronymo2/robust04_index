			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Letter: Pensions below 60 still a matter of discretion Sir, Richard Waters' article on pensions in the Finance Bill ('Revenue paves way for curbs', April 18) gives a strong inference that pension ages below 60 are no longer allowed in any circumstance. The change in clause 33 of the Finance Bill amending allowable retirement ages applies only to schemes approved by the Inland Revenue under mandatory approval. Few occupational schemes are approved under this route. The vast majority, probably more than 99 per cent, are approved under Revenue discretionary approval. The clauses on discretionary approval give the Inland Revenue very wide powers. For instance, in some circumstances for certain occupations, footballers and deep sea divers for example, they have approved pension schemes with normal pension ages considerably below those allowed under mandatory approval. There is nothing in the Finance Bill which changes or restricts such practice. The Inland Revenue is believed to be currently reviewing its discretionary practices. An announcement is now expected in September in the form of the issue of new Inland Revenue Practice Notes. These notes summarise how it exercises its discretion granted to its under the legislation. It could well be that for ordinary schemes under its discretionary powers the Inland Revenue restricts pension ages to the band from age 60 to 75, irrespective of sex. However, until the issue of new Practice Notes or some other announcement, it is not actually known what the Inland Revenue's attitude with regard to pension ages will be for the vast majority of pension schemes.

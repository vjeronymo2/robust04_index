			<p>BFN     [Text] Today, Russian President Boris Yeltsin ordered its  security forces to free Russia from criminals and pointed out  that ministers will be personally responsible for the success or  the failure of the new measures. During a news conference held  at the Kremlin, on the occasion of the fourth anniversary of the  declaration of Russia's sovereignty, Yeltsin said that crime has  become Russia's scourge. President Yeltsin added that his  government has adopted a new plan to fight criminal  organizations, which, as he said, are infiltrating the nation's  economy and attempting to infiltrate the political sector as  well.    A true crime wave has affected Russian since last year,  especially in Moscow, where criminal organizations have  connections. Yeltsin described these organizations as the  criminal garbage that is attempting to spread throughout the  country.</p>

			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / Foreign Exchanges: D-Mark weakens on M3 data THE DOLLAR soared against the D-Mark last night in London following news that president Boris Yeltsin had suspended the Russian parliament, writes James Blitz. For most of the day in London, the D-Mark had been confined to the DM1.6005 to DM1.6200 range that has been established against the dollar. But the dissolution of the Russian congress and news that Vice-president Alexander Rutskoi had named himself President pushed the dollar up sharply. The US currency tends to perform well at times of international crisis, while D-Mark investors have sometimes been concerned at times of crisis in Russia by the level of German economic investment in the former Soviet Union. The dollar peaked at DM1.6425 after earlier closing in London at DM1.6195. The US currency also performed strongly against the Japanese yen, peaking at Y107.30. The dollar ended New York trading at DM1.6385 and Y106.33. Earlier in the day, strong figures for August US home starts lifted the dollar to its highs when New York opened. The 7.8 per cent jump was seen by most analysts as a long-awaited correction to what has been a disappointing sector of the economy. The D-Mark also had a mixed performance against the dollar and European currencies as dealers had different interpretations about the latest figure for German monetary growth. The August figure for M3 monetary growth has been the source of rumour and counter-rumour in recent days, with wild estimates as to its level. Some dealers found the annualised figure of 7.2 per cent rather lower than expected, considering that this had been a period of intense Bundesbank intervention in the European exchange rate mechanism, and took the view that this figure could help the German central bank to cut rates. That view seemed to hold sway in the trading of some cross rates. The D-Mark closed weaker against the French franc at FFr3.487 from a previous FFr3.491. However, the D-Mark was stronger against a number of other European currencies. Sterling finished at DM2.4675 from a previous DM2.4700. The larger than expected reduction in the Japanese discount rate applied no downward pressure on the yen at the start of European trading. But the yen fell back later in Europe as dealers took the view that the cut would mean that the US would not take a confrontational stand against Japan when the two sides meet in Washington later this week. Before the news from Russia, the yen had closed at Y106.30 per dollar in London from a previous Y104.25. 'The dollar/yen rate is a political animal above all,' said Mr Jeremy Hawkins, economic adviser at Bank of America, 'and as long as the politics between the US and Japan remain calm there is no reason why the dollar should not go a lot higher.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] After President Gonzalo Sanchez de Losada  received an invitation from Chilean President-elect Eduardo Frei  to attend his presidential inauguration in March, the opposition  and government coalition on 9 February agreed that it is not  correct for Sanchez de Losada to accept the invitation because  the two countries do not maintain diplomatic relations, although  the government coalition congressmen were more cautious in their  comments.    Beyond the difference of approach toward the maritime  vindication subject, the chiefs of Condepa [Conscience of the  Fatherland], Carlos Palenque; the ADN [Nationalist Democratic  Action], Jorge Landivar; and MIR [Movement of the Revolutionary  Left], Hugo Carvajal, maintained that Chile has caused Bolivia's  isolation from the sea and has historically denied it any  possibility to a sovereign outlet to the Pacific Ocean.    According to Foreign Ministry sources consulted by an  international news agency, Sanchez de Losada is studying the  possibility of attending the presidential inauguration in Chile  on 11 March. On that day, Chilean President Patricio Aylwin will  pass the presidency to Eduardo Frei, who won the last general  elections.    LA RAZON learned last night that the national government has  practically rejected the possibility that President Gonzalo  Sanchez de Losada will attend the ceremony, although the reason  for not doing so was not explained.

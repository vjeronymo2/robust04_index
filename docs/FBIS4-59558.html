			<p>BFN     [Text] The closing session of the Jordanian-Palestinian  Economic Committee, due to have convened in Amman this morning,  has been postponed. Also postponed was a subsequent news  conference by the chairmen of the Jordanian and Palestinian  sides to the committee, Dr. Jawad al-'Anani, minister of state  for cabinet affairs and minister of information; and Mr. Ahmad  Quray', the PLO's Economic Department chief.    In a statement to the JORDANIAN NEWS AGENCY, Dr. al-'Anani  attributed the delay to the preoccupation of the Palestinian  leadership with numerous issues, including the formation of the  Palestinian Authority Council and matters related to the  transfer of power.    The final session of the Jordanian-Palestinian talks that  began in Amman Tuesday [10 May] is due to be held within days.    During the two-day meeting, the committee addressed numerous  economic items, including trade, banking, monetary policies,  customs, and tourism.</p>

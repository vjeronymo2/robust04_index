			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Slow Speed Is Life-Threatening"] </F>   [Text] First a few figures. In 1993, according to  Roskommetallurgii [Russian Federation Committee on Metallurgy],  metal consumption declined as follows compared with 1992:    --by 29.3 percent for rolled ferrous metals;    --by one-half for aluminum;    --by a factor of 1.7 for transportation metal;    --to one-quarter as much for high-strength drilling pipe;    --by one-half for compressor pipe;    --by 41 percent for rolled nonferrous metals; and    --by 50 percent for hard alloys and blends.    The list may be continued, adding more and more new items,  but the trend is clear and alarming. An economy without metal,  and it is a basic structural material here, is leading to a  complete decline.    Each year no less than a million metric tons of rails are  installed for Russia's railroads. This is not being done now.  Essentially, the tracks are not being repaired as they should  be. There are more and more sections where speeds are  restricted. We do not hear of any new railroad lines at all.  There are limits to pipeline transport service, where the danger  of accidents and disasters is increasing. The construction  industry is taking barely one-fifth of the amount of metal which  it used previously. And there is a recession in investments.  Russia is being deindustrialized.    The payments system is one of the reasons for the difficult  economic situation. Serafim Afonin, the chairman of  Roskommetallurgii, is convinced that the present one is wrong.  Under market conditions, no one should have privileges. But  electric power engineering and the railroads are taking away the  money anyway. After all these deductions, coal and iron ore have  to be purchased from the remains.    As a result, metallurgists are settling only half their  accounts with partners in money. The other half is by exchange  in kind. Networks of 11 units are already being set up.    As of 1 January 1994, metal consumers owed 4.3 trillion  rubles [R] to the plants. The metallurgists, in turn, owe R3  trillion to the suppliers. But taking into account what is owed  to the budget, to the banks for nonbudgetary funds, and to  others, the debt owed to creditors is R5.4 trillion.  Metallurgical enterprises' own working capital declined from  51.5 percent in 1992 to 27.3 percent in 1993.    But perhaps metal is not in demand anywhere in the world? Or  our Russian steel is not competitive? Not at all! Here are a few  figures to think about.    The export of ferrous metals has doubled, reaching about $4  billion in 1993. This includes an increase of 50.6 percent to  Asian countries, 33.9 percent to Western Europe, and 4.9 percent  to North America.    The export pattern has been changed, according to materials  from Roskommetallurgii. The proportion of rolled metal (the  finished product) has increased to 51.3 percent, and the  proportion of unfinished work pieces has dropped to 30 percent.    Several exports of nonferrous metals have decreased, but  this  is another subject.    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Indicators of the Effectiveness of the "Federal Program for Technical Reeq-|  |uipment and Development of Russia's Metallurgy (1993-2000)"                |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Indicator Descrip-|Unit of Measureme-|For the Program a-|Including the 1993|  |tion              |nt                |s a Whole, 1993-20|-1996 Period      |  |                  |                  |00                |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1.

The notice may be given by telephone or facsimile, but if it is given by telephone, such notice must be confirmed in writing before another payment is issued. The notification must contain sufficient information to identify the account and/or the obligation to which the payment is related. Payment on a FedSelect check is stopped if the notice of non-receipt, loss, theft, or destruction is received from the agency at such time and in such manner as to afford the payor Reserve Bank and the FMS a reasonable opportunity to act on it prior to final payment, as provided by applicable law. Once a stop payment order has been placed against an outstanding FedSelect check, such stop payment order will not be removed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The agency that issued the FedSelect check will issue another FedSelect check to replace a lost, stolen or destroyed FedSelect check, or other form of payment, at its discretion. Items an agency may require before issuing another FedSelect check include:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Written confirmation that the original FedSelect check was lost, stolen, or destroyed;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Confirmation from the FMS that the original FedSelect check is unpaid;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) A determination that recovery of the original FedSelect check is unlikely; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) An indemnification agreement executed by the payee and/or indorsee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) If a payor Reserve Bank refuses payment on a FedSelect check solely as a result of &sect;247.8(c), the agency that issued the original FedSelect check may issue, at its discretion, another FedSelect check, or other form of payment, to a payee or holder upon surrender of the original FedSelect check and execution of such indemnification agreement as may be required by the agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Upon verification of the existence of a forged or unauthorized indorsement on a FedSelect check which has been finally paid, the agency that issued the original FedSelect check may issue, at its discretion, another FedSelect check or other form of payment to the person entitled. Disputes as to any continuing obligations for payment remain between the agency that issued the payment and the payee. Prior to the issuance of another FedSelect check, the payee or indorsee of the original FedSelect check may be required to execute an affidavit asserting that the payee or indorsee was in no way involved in the fraudulent or unauthorized indorsement of the original FedSelect check, in addition to any indemnification agreement required by the agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) In the case of a FedSelect check payable to the order of two or more persons, the requirements of this section apply to all designated payees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

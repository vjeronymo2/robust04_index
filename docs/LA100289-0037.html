			<p><P> October 2, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TUESDAY'S VOTE IS A HIGH-STAKE GAMBLE FOR CATHEDRAL CITY MAYOR  </P> <P> In 1987, businessman George Hardie decided to build a card parlor on a chunk of  land he owns in this desert community next door to Palm Springs.  </P> <P> But when Hardie -- managing partner of the Bicycle Club casino in Bell Gardens  -- shared his plans with a few City Council members, he got the cold shoulder.  </P> <P> Never one to back down with a whimper, Hardie figured if you can't beat 'em,  join 'em. He bought a condominium in Cathedral City and ran for City Council.  Mounting an expensive campaign, he won a seat in April, 1988, and was promptly  named mayor by his council colleagues.  </P> <P> Before his freshman year was half over, Hardie, 55, had resurrected his card  parlor proposal. He then launched a petition drive that landed a measure on the  ballot to legalize casinos in Cathedral City.  </P> <P> The denouement to this tale comes Tuesday, when voters here will decide whether  to permit people to play cards for money in their town. While the gambling  issue itself is controversial, more than that is at stake: In a sense, the  special election is a referendum on George Hardie, Mayor.  </P> <P> "It is (about) me, absolutely," Hardie acknowledged last week in an interview  at his plush, wood-paneled office above the Bicycle Club's jam-packed gaming  tables.  </P> <P> His opponents agree: "The issue is Hardie," said Anne Zachary, 71, a  coordinator of anti-gambling forces in Cathedral City.  </P> <P> "He's a carpetbagger, a smart businessman who came in here determined to get  his casino built. But I think he misjudged this community. . . . We're not that  stupid."  </P> <P> Two measures are on Tuesday's ballot. The first would repeal Cathedral City's  current ban on card-room gambling and the second would regulate the games. If  voters approve, draw poker, lowball, pan and other games allowed under  California law could be played 24 hours a day by those 21 and older. No Las  Vegas-style gambling would be permitted.  </P> <P> Only one gaming license for every 25,000 residents -- there are about 29,000  people in Cathedral City today -- could be issued under the regulations, and a  companion hotel development would be required along with any card parlor built.  Up to 10% of the gaming revenue earned annually would be shared with the city.  </P> <P> So far, Hardie's proposal for a $25-million hotel and gaming complex -- the  Emerald Court Resort -- on land he owns in the center of town is the only plan  tailored to the proposed ordinance.  </P> <P> The campaign over the gambling measures has been a nasty one, waged with verve  despite the blistering desert sun.  </P> <P> Gambling foes have invoked God, the Bible and traditional values in their  battle to keep card parlors out of town. On the other side, Hardie and his  followers have borrowed from Voltaire -- the French satirist who railed against  religious intolerance -- to argue that the issue is a matter of freedom of  choice.  </P> <P> Opponents of card parlors have accused Hardie of using his office merely to  expand his gaming empire, while the mayor has called anti-gambling forces  "loonies" who want "everybody to go to bed at 8 o'clock every night."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Shadowed by Detectives  </P> <P> Tactics have often been imaginative. One anti-gambling crusader said she and  her family were trailed for a month by private investigators but it was never  learned who hired the detectives. More recently, Hardie and his Cathedral City  home were monitored by opponents, who unveiled their finding at a press  conference and accused him of being an "absentee mayor."  </P> <P> The latest campaign twist came when Hardie suggested that a form letter he  received from Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp proved that the state's top law  enforcement official has no problem with card clubs. The letter, which Hardie  displayed during a televised debate, asked the mayor to support Van de Kamp in  his gubernatorial race. That invitation was withdrawn, however, when Van de  Kamp learned that Mayor George Hardie was the same George Hardie who manages  the Bicycle Club. The attorney general's campaign manager labeled Hardie's use  of the letter "a questionable tactic."  </P> <P> Hardie and the 40 Southern California investors seeking to build the Cathedral  City resort have provided almost all of the financing for the pro-gambling  forces, who had raised $187,600 as of the most recent campaign disclosure  deadline.  </P> <P> Although hopeful his development will be profitable, Hardie says self-interest  is not his main motivation in pushing the initiative. Instead, he said,  Cathedral City -- a rapidly growing community with few tax-generating  businesses to support its swelling municipal budget -- needs the jobs and  estimated $604,000 in annual net revenue that would be generated by the card  club.  </P> <P> Long viewed as the "poor stepchild" of the Coachella Valley, Cathedral City  needs a resort with unique appeal to help it compete for tourists with better  known neighboring cities, Hardie argues.  </P> <P> Opponents -- who have raised about $45,000 -- say Hardie's got it all wrong.  Permitting gambling will harm property values, deter vacationing families and  usher in a host of "unsavory characters" who will make Cathedral City's streets  unsafe, said Carol Engelhard, 37, a mother of three and a leading anti-gambling  crusader.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'It's Frightening'  </P> <P> "This thing would be half a mile from a brand-new elementary school. Half a  mile," said Engelhard, whose group was launched with $5,000 from the  Anaheim-based Traditional Values Coalition, an activist religious group best  known for its fervent crusades against abortion and homosexuality. "To think of  gamblers drinking all day and then driving down streets our children cross,  it's frightening."  </P> <P> A primary theme in the gambling debate has been Hardie's performance as mayor.  For starters, his critics maintain that it is inappropriate for Hardie to serve  as the city's top elected official while pushing a ballot measure that would  benefit him personally. Hardie disagrees, as did the city attorney in an  opinion earlier this year.  </P> <P> Others complain that the mayor runs the city from his casino in Bell Gardens --  requiring expensive long-distance phone calls between him and city staff -- and  spends little time mixing with local citizens. A member of one anti-gambling  group staked out Hardie's condominium and found he spent just six nights there  in August.  </P> <P> Hardie, who has a home in Downey, counters that most people leave Cathedral  City "when it's 120 degrees in August" and argues that he is more accessible  than any previous mayor of the city, which incorporated in 1981.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sincerity Questioned  </P> <P> Other detractors question Hardie's sincerity, charging that he ran for mayor  merely to boost his chances of building a casino in town. As Engelhard sees it,  Hardie is an exploiter using Cathedral City as a "testing ground" before  expanding gambling ventures to other communities.  </P> <P> Hardie rejects that contention, insisting his political career has nothing to  do with card parlors. As for his critics' predictions that he seeks to launch  gaming clubs in other cities around California, Hardie says that is true.  Indeed, he recently formed a political action committee to make donations to  state lawmakers who might support legislation favorable to the gambling  industry.  </P> <P> The mayor, however, believes his business ventures deserve praise, not  criticism.  </P> <P> "I am looking in other cities, wherever there's an opportunity," he said,  declining to disclose any prospective card club locations. "I don't believe  there are any limits. I admire people who try to achieve. Who moves the world  forward? People like me, entrepreneurs who risk and try to make life better."  </P></p>

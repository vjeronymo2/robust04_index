			<p><P> May 9, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SEA OF CONFUSION OVER 'FRESH FISH' DEFINITION;  </P> <P> FOOD: CONGRESS MAY INTERVENE WITH BILLS TO PROTECT THE SEAFOOD BUYER.  </P> <P> When you walk into your neighborhood fish market or grocery store, the display  case is filled with "fresh" swordfish, "fresh" salmon, "fresh" shrimp, "fresh"  petrale sole.  </P> <P> But then you take your catch home and find that your "fresh" filet has a frozen  center. Or your fork finds mush instead of firm flesh.  </P> <P> How long has your dinner been away from the ocean? And what has happened to it  since it left the waves behind?  </P> <P> Consumer groups contend that there is little regulation of the seafood industry  and that shoppers should beware of what they buy and how it is sold.  </P> <P> "Under current law, consumers can be misled as to fish products' freshness, its  quality and which species it is meant to be," said Ellen Haas, executive  director of Public Voice for Food and Health Policy, a consumer group based in  Washington. "There are inadequate standards for labeling."  </P> <P> The Food and Drug Administration is charged with ensuring that food labeling is  not false or misleading, but the agency has no definition of "fresh," no  standards or criteria for using the term to sell food.  </P> <P> "Fresh is a meaningless term as it's used in supermarkets today," said Nancy H.  Hasselback, publisher of Seafood Business magazine. "There are deceptive  practices everywhere, and some people label seafood fresh when they mean  previously frozen."  </P> <P> Consumers aren't the only ones confused about the fish they find. The seafood  industry itself is at times unclear on the concept of freshness.  </P> <P> "Do you know or have you ever thought about how much of what we call 'fresh  seafood sales' is really 'previously frozen'?" Russ Byerly, vice president of  retail merchandising for the New England Shrimp Co., asked as he addressed  retailers Tuesday at the Food Marketing Institute's annual supermarket  convention in Chicago.  </P> <P> "Have we misused the word 'fresh' " to cover all fish sold in special seafood  sections of supermarkets, he asked. "I think we have."  </P> <P> What consumers consider "fresh" fish is often described by the seafood industry  in Byerly's terminology: "fresh never frozen." But even if a consumer were to  buy fish so labeled, there is no assurance that it has seen the ocean in recent  days.  </P> <P> "The standard rule of thumb is that fish caught 10 days ago is fresh,"  Hasselback said. And that's one reason why frozen seafood can be better than  fresh, she said.  </P> <P> Fresh-never-frozen seafood accounts for less than half of today's fresh seafood  sales, Byerly told convention-goers. Orange roughy, snow crab, king crab and  imported red snapper are almost always delivered frozen to the retailer.  </P> <P> And shrimp, which account for about 40% of all seafood sales, are rarely sold  fresh, he said.  </P> <P> Freshness is more than just a truth-in-labeling issue, Haas said. It's a food  safety issue, too. For what begins as a question of language becomes a question  of food handling.  </P> <P> Consumers need to know if the fish they buy has been frozen and thawed out  because foods should not be frozen twice and then eaten.  </P> <P> "You should not refreeze anything -- seafood, meat or poultry," said Tony  Rugnetta, sales executive for Met Fisheries Inc. "If you do, you're looking for  problems. You lose all kinds of taste, get an upset stomach, and food poisoning  could result."  </P> <P> Met Fisheries, a seafood packer and processor based in New Bedford, Mass.,  sells fresh and frozen seafood to distributors, supermarkets and food service  businesses throughout the United States.  </P> <P> The company's specialty is flying fish to its destination within 24 hours of  catching it. But it also sells a line of frozen filets.  </P> <P> "Markets should say when a fish is previously frozen, and we suggest they do,"  Rugnetta said. "A&amp;P markets it as previously frozen along with recipes.  (Frozen fish) is consistent in quality, price and availability."  </P> <P> At Santa Monica Seafood Co., a 50-year-old firm on Colorado Boulevard, fresh  fish has been labeled for the past six or seven years with the words "fresh  fish not frozen."  </P> <P> "I don't think too many people would think fondly of buying fish they've been  told is fresh and finding out it'd been frozen at one time," said Vincent  Cigliano, director of operations.  </P> <P> The U.S. Department of Agriculture has oversight responsibility for meat and  poultry. Seafood, however, falls under the jurisdiction of the FDA, which is  authorized to inspect food processors and fisheries for safety, cleanliness,  proper handling and labeling, said Cynthia Leggett, FDA spokeswoman. In  addition, the Department of Commerce oversees a voluntary inspection program  for fish processors.  </P> <P> "But we don't have the staff to inspect," Leggett said. "We have 510  investigators in the United States, and there are 60,000 food firms."  </P> <P> As a result, the FDA will visit a fish processing plant once every four years  or so. In contrast, the U.S. Department of Agriculture inspects meat and  poultry plants daily with a staff of 10,000, Leggett said.  </P> <P> Leaving labeling and inspection up to businesses and current FDA procedures is  not enough, Haas said. Tougher legislation is necessary.  </P> <P> Congressional committees are considering several bills that would address  health concerns and tighten fish inspection and labeling. The version that  Public Voice is pushing is the Consumer Seafood Safety Act, introduced by Sen.  Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) and Rep. Dan Glickman (D-Kan.).  </P> <P> "This would set very strict standards for using words like 'fresh' and prohibit  retailers from using 'fresh' unless the product meets the definition," Haas  said.  </P> <P> But what's a consumer to do until such safeguards are passed?  </P> <P> "Be bold," Hasselback said. "Ask to smell the fish . . . Ask where it came  from, how it was caught."  </P> <P> </P> <P> FISH LABELING TERMS  </P> <P> The Food and Drug Administration is charged with keeping companies from using  false and misleading terms in food labeling. But there are no definitions that  cover terminology used in the sale of fish. A few pointers follow:  </P> <P> Fresh -- Generally means unfrozen, but there are no criteria that define it.  Fish labeled as fresh could have been caught as much as 10 days before purchase  by consumers. Does not ensure that the seafood has not been frozen.  </P> <P> Fresh never frozen -- Term usually used for what consumers consider to be  fresh. Also known as not previously frozen.  </P> <P> Refrigerated -- Another term used for not previously frozen. For example, Nancy  H. Hasselback, publisher of Seafood Business magazine, used the term Tuesday as  follows: "Fresh, or more appropriately, refrigerated, seafood can take much of  the credit for seafood's boost in popularity during the '80s."  </P> <P> Previously frozen -- Seafood that has been frozen by a fish processor and  thawed by the retailer, either for convenience or to provide an image of  freshness.  </P> <P> Frozen at sea -- Seafood that has been frozen, usually within hours of catch,  on factory trawlers.  </P> <P> Frozen -- Could be frozen at sea or shipped to a processing plant on land for  freezing and shipping.  </P> <P> </P> <P> NEXT STEP  </P> <P> Nine bills relating to seafood safety are pending in Congress. In addition to  tightening inspection, they would decide which federal agency would oversee the  program. Resolution of the issue is expected this summer.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Ivan Zakharchenko] </F>   [Text] Seoul May 20 -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin on  Friday sent a personal message to President Kim Yong-sam of the  Republic of Korea about a postponement of the first session of  the Russian-South Korean Intergovernmental Commission for  Economic Cooperation, according to diplomatic sources in Seoul.    The sources said the letter explains that the commission's  session, which was previously scheduled to be held on Seoul on  May 20, has been postponed because Aleksandr Shokhin,  vice-premier and minister of economics, cannot arrive in South  Korea "due to purely domestic problems".    Yeltsin suggested that the commission hold a session in  Moscow before Kim's visit to Russia. The visit is scheduled for  June 1-4.</p>

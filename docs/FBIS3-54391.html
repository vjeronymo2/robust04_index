Our  correspondent reports on the latest developments there:    Sources from the two warring sides present contradictory  reports about the outcome of battles during the last two days.  Both sides, however, confirm that battles in Kabul during the  last 48 hours have left hundreds of people dead or injured. An  official of the Ministry of Intelligence and Culture [as heard],  who is close to the Afghan president, said today: Forces  opposing the government have been forced to retreat from the  positions they occupied on the first day of the battles.  Furthermore, he said, 200 fighters of the [Afghanistan Islamic  Revolution] Coordination Council have been killed.    Meanwhile, a spokesman for Hezb-e Eslami [Islamic Party of  Afghanistan] said that in the battles during the last two days a  number of areas, such as the Microryan residential estate, the  senior officers' training complex, Hidgah mosque and parts of  the Hudkheyl area have been captured by the forces of the  Coordination Council. He added: A large number of forces loyal  to the government have been killed or wounded in the process,  and tens of corpses still litter the battle grounds. The  spokesman also announced: A Scud surface-to-surface missile was  fired from Mazar Sharif toward positions held by Sayyaf's Hezb-e  Ettehad-e Eslami [Islamic Union] forces in the Karizmir area,  near Paghman. He added: Paghman, situated west of Kabul, has  also been bombarded by General Dostam's aircraft.    Meanwhile, reports indicate that during yesterday and today  a  Coordination Council delegation to Islamabad met and conferred  with the ambassadors of France, America, Russia, and England,  the UN envoy in charge of Afghan affairs, and an Islamic  Conference Organization delegation. It was announced that these  meetings with foregin ambassadors and envoys are taking place in  order to enable the Council to explain its stances, while at the  same time it is hoped that ways of establishing a cease-fire in  Kabul will be achieved through these meetings.</p>

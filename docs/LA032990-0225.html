Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> MUNCH 'MADONNA' PRINT STOLEN  </P> <P> A rare lithographic print of Norwegian painter Edvard Munch's "Madonna" was  stolen from an art gallery in central Oslo early today, police said.  </P> <P> Munch's "Madonna," one of the most famous lithographic works, and three  lesser-known works of art were removed by the thieves, who used an iron rail to  batter down the entrance to the gallery.  </P> <P> According to one of the gallery owners, the theft of the "Madonna" was likely  to have been what he called a "contract job" for a collector. Kjell Wenstad of  the Kunsthuset gallery said the print, estimated to be worth about $245,000,  was very rare and would be extremely difficult to sell.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Enrico Marro report: "War Over Taxation"] </F>   [Text] Rome -- Everyone has entered the arena for the  battle of the taxes that is enlivening the election campaign.  On the one hand, there is [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi,  promising to have "everyone pay less," and, on the other, the  progressive forces, Mario Segni's Pact, and Mino Martinazzoli's  Popular Party, who accuse him of demagoguery and of wanting to  empty the state's coffers. In Italy too, as in the United  States and Britain, this time votes will be gained partly on the  basis of tax promises.    Forza Italia has proposed a single income tax rate of 30  percent for all. But how are we to ensure that the rich pay  proportionately more than the poor? By means of allowances on  taxable income, Silvio Berlusconi's experts say. "In order to  cancel out the negative impact on lower incomes," PDS  [Democratic Party of the Left] economist Vincenzo Visco said,  "the present deductions would have to be at least doubled. This  would entail a frightening loss of revenue. It is easy to  conduct propaganda in connection with taxation, but it is much  more difficult to introduce reforms." According to Pact for  Italy leader Mario Segni, Forza Italia's proposal "is clearly  demagogic and would not achieve the progressive nature of  taxation envisaged by the Constitution." This is a "nonexistent  conjecture," according to Martinazzoli.    The PRI [Italian Republican Party] daily, LA VOCE  REPUBBLICANA, points out that Alan Ford's cartoon features a  character called "Superchuk, a bizarre character who robs the  poor to give to the rich. Is there perhaps a Robin Hood in  reverse among the advisers of the magnate of Arcore  [Berlusconi]?" According to the CGIL [Italian General  Confederation of Labor], these "extravagant promises" are  "neo-Reaganite." Yesterday evening Berlusconi replied in an  interview on television channel four news: "The progressive  forces are still distorting the facts. First, our proposal  envisages exemption from taxation for all the poorest families.  Also we want to introduce an allowance for each family member,  so that larger families will pay less." Lowering the rate to 30  percent, he added, will "ensure that those with higher incomes  have less incentive to evade taxation and more incentive to  invest." According to Forza Italia's economist, Antonio Martino,  "poor people will no longer have to pay income tax." In an  interview he said: "Those leveling charges against us are in  fact defending a system in which for those with taxable incomes  of just 14.4 million lire, there is a tax rate of 27 percent,  close to the current U.S. maximum of 28 percent. The result is  that poor people in Italy pay tax the same rate as applies to  the Rockefellers in America."    "A single tax rate," Segni replied, "is unknown in all the  Western industrialized countries." It is better to "merge tax  rates, reducing them to three or four and eliminating the  highest and lowest rates." Tax expert Giulio Tremonti pointed  out that "everyone is proposing bits of reform but forgetting  the overall picture." AN [National Alliance] leader Gianfranco  Fini proposed "a few clear regulations." The battle is likely  to continue until the elections. The new system, which has led  to a contest to the last vote among the three major alignments,  favors the definition of well-defined stances. On 27-28 March  three-fourths of parliamentary seats will be allocated to  whoever wins in each electoral constituency. With the decline  of the ideologically inspired vote, support must be gained on  the basis of specifics. And taxation features very prominently  among these.    In its own election program Forza Italia proposes abolishing  the current seven income tax rates (from the minimum 10 percent  for those earning up to 7.2 million to the maximum 51 percent  for those earning over 300 million) and replacing them with a  single rate of 30 percent for everyone. Two days ago the  progressive alignment, led by [PDS Secretary] Achille Occhetto,  replied with calculations of its own, from which it emerges that  by implementing a single 30 percent rate, people earning up to  70 million a year would pay more tax than they do now, whereas  those earning more would make considerable savings. That is not  true, Forza Italia replied: The calculations fail to take  account of the allowances that we want to introduce.    But apart from these calculations, the rival alignments are  not relinquishing their traditional polemical confrontations.  "The latest opinion polls tell us that 87 percent of Chinese  citizens want Berlusconi as emperor of China," the Popular  Party's Mino Martinazzoli said, in connection with Forza  Italia's improving ratings in the opinion polls. "No specific  arguments, and no ideas: All Martinazzoli is left with are petty  jibes," Berlusconi's men replied.</p>

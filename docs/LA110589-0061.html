			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TEXAN FRUITCAKES  </P> <P> I thoroughly enjoyed David M. Kinchen's article about Corsicana fruitcakes and  Texas courthouses ("Locate the Fruitcake and You Get a Lone Star," Oct. 15),  but I must voice my disappointment that he did not include the courthouses in  Hillsboro and Marshall -- both singled out by art historians as being  outstanding examples of Victorian architecture in Texas.  </P> <P> VIRGINIA GAUSTAD  </P> <P> Redlands  </P></p>

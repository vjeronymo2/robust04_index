			<p>920413 FT  13 APR 92 / Leading Article: From recession to recovery THE ELECTORATE has warmed to the Conservative party. The economy is likely to be less helpful. Increased confidence is wonderful; real interest rates at 5 per cent or more are not. As in some rather less important areas, here too Mr Major's government needs to take stock. It must start with the opportunities and the dangers facing the economy. The opportunity is to attain price stability at last; the danger is that there will be no real recovery. The challenge is to exploit the opportunity and avoid the dangers. Mr Major has the time to do both. But experience during the last term demonstrates that he does not have limitless time. Most pundits have been as mistaken in their understanding of UK economic policy as were their brethren of its politics. Entry into the ERM was not a repudiation of monetarism; it was its apotheosis: the UK economy is not only subject to the drag of a nominal exchange rate anchored in the D-Mark, but is guided by a target for broad money quite as tight as during the early years of the Thatcher administration. But then it was sterling M3; now it is D-Mark M3. Any consistently pursued monetary target will work in the end, however disconcertingly. Everyone should now act on the assumption that inflation will fall to levels not seen for a generation. Pay settlements, for example, must be no more than 2-3 per cent, a level consistent with sustained low inflation and enhanced competitiveness. But lower inflation is not the end of the story. The real costs of achieving it in unemployment and reduced investment are already high and will become higher. Worse, even if finally achieved, low inflation would still not guarantee recovery. When overall inflation might fall as low as 2 per cent, when prices of important assets have been falling and are widely expected to fall further, when both individuals and companies - especially smaller ones  - are already highly indebted, and when the world's two largest economies are themselves suffering in the iron grip of falling asset prices and excessive indebtedness, renewed voluntary lending and borrowing can hardly be expected at base rates of interest anywhere near 10.5 per cent. What is more, it should not be expected, since such borrowing is most unlikely to be sound. It is on the pace of recovery, therefore, not on prospects for inflation, that the government is most likely to be disappointed. The Treasury now forecasts a recovery comparable to that from the recession of a decade ago. Unfortunately, conditions now are far less favourable. US comparison Then the real exchange rate depreciated, real interest rates were lower than now, a preceding burst of inflation had purged the economy of debt and the US economy was the locomotive of world recovery. Now, by contrast, the real exchange rate is stable, real interest rates are tending to rise again and the economy is drowned in debt. What the latter might mean is revealed by the comparison with the US, which is making a feeble recovery, despite official interest rates little more than a third of those in the UK. Before the government dismisses such fears, it must confront the mistakes of the Treasury, which failed to forecast the boom of 1987-88, just as it failed to foresee the slump of 1990-91. These failures were not an accident. They reflect a misunderstanding of the role of credit and money in a liberalised economy. Nothing would be more foolish than for the government to rely on Treasury forecasts. It needs to ask, instead, what could still block recovery. The first danger is at home. The real exchange rate may not be grossly overvalued, but nothing in the performance of industries producing traded goods and services suggests it is highly competitive. A dynamic export-led recovery looks highly unlikely. Furthermore, those who borrowed in the hope of capital appreciation are in deepening trouble, as are the intermediaries that made the borrowing possible. The second danger lies in the world economy: Germany has added recession to the instability already created by economic unification; Japan is suffering an agonised withdrawal from a monetary overdose; the US is making an uneasy recovery from its own rush into debt; and the Uruguay round of multilateral trade negotiations is still not completed. Trouble lies ahead. Not only might recovery be aborted, but a continuation of slow growth would further undermine the UK's rapidly deteriorating public finances. An economy growing at, say, 1-2 per cent a year cannot long afford growth of public expenditure at 3 per cent a year, at least if the achievement of lower inflation is not to be called into question. Mr Major's new team, with hard-liners like Michael Portillo at the Treasury, Peter Lilley at Social Security and Michael Howard at the Department of the Environment, will have to put its energies into curbing public spending once more. The government does at least have time. It can wait a while, to ensure that inflation is crushed. But it must start looking for sources of recovery. The necessary condition will be far lower interest rates than now. Within the ERM, that can be achieved either by expectation of currency appreciation against the D-Mark; or by lower D-Mark interest rates. The former is why it is essential to remain within the ERM's wide bands, at least for the moment. The second appears, for now, to be a matter of waiting and hoping. D-Mark expectations There has been talk of sterling re-alignment. But a re-alignment within the ERM, though helpful to producers of traded goods, is also likely to lead to higher interest rates. So long as the D-Mark is expected never to be re-aligned downwards, German interest rates will normally provide the floor. The distance from that floor might well be increased by the perception that one depreciation usually leads to another. For the present, re-alignment is not a sensible option. But this does not mean that Mr Major is condemned to inactivity. His main problem is German interest rates. But it is not his problem alone. He now has the authority to deliver home truths to Mr Helmut Kohl, preferably in the company of other European leaders. Mr Major should tell his friend that being a good European involves more than rhetoric. Should the Bundesbank still feel unable to deliver a sharp reduction in interest rates within the next year, then those unneighbourly German fiscal deficits must be eliminated. Though speaking softly, Mr Major should also carry a big stick. He should state that it will be unacceptable for the remaining economies of western Europe to go on importing recession from Germany, once they have finally attained Germany's erstwhile rate of inflation. At the limit monetary co-operation in Europe might collapse. That would threaten, but need not destroy, the UK's hard-won credibility. Mr Major need only accept that having chosen one independent central bank in the Bundesbank, he could also choose another in the Bank of England. It is time to take stock. It is time for leadership. The UK stands on the brink of achieving a low inflation economy. But it does not necessarily stand on the brink of a strong recovery. For the moment, the UK economy must wait for something to turn up - or, more precisely, for interest rates to turn down - in Germany. Mr Major can make that point where it matters. He should do so at once.</p>

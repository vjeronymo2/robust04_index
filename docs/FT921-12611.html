			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: BT The imminent pricing review by the telecoms regulator makes it a difficult time to value BT. But its shares have underperformed the market by a fifth since October, mainly because its high profits and return on capital make it unusually vulnerable to interference. The question is whether the market has overlooked a simple way in which the group might try to strengthen its defences. According to Robert Fleming, BT's high profitability is partly due to the abandonment of the group's traditional depreciation policy when it was privatised in 1984. At the same time, the balance sheet was altered by heavy asset write-downs and one-off charges to reserves. These changes had the double effect of increasing BT's reported profits and raising its return on capital. During the pricing review, it would be quite reasonable for BT to propose an acceleration of its depreciation rates. After all, other European telecoms companies, particularly Deutsche Telekom, have already implemented a similar policy, basing their argument on shorter technological lifespans. The dampening effect on BT's profits would relieve the political and regulatory pressure, while the group's enormous cash flow would be unaffected. If Oftel could be persuaded to sanction such an old-style piece of creative accounting, it should be worth something on the price.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Military Communique No. 26, issued by the command of the </F> Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of Yemen; place and date  not given]    [Text] Our Armed Forces have continued their heroic  military operations against the forces of aggression and enmity,  led by the bloody and treacherous al-Ahmar gang, since their  instigation of total war against our people in the DRY. Our  heroic forces were able to deliver crushing blows to enemy  forces on all battlefronts in the Kharaz-bab al-Mandeb,  al-'Anad-Kirsh, Abyan, and Shabwah Governorate areas.    Reports from these battlefronts indicate that our forces,  which are being supported widely by the people of our young  Republic, have inflicted great defeats on the oppressive enemy  forces in the Abyan Governorate, inflicting heavy losses of life  and material on them. Our forces there captured an infantry  battalion, complete with its arms and equipment. Yesterday, our  forces destroyed a number of tanks and four Katyusha rocket  launching vehicles, and also captured four tanks and two  Katyusha rocket launching vehicles. They inflicted heavy losses  of life on the enemy on this front, with hundreds of them killed  or wounded.    On the al-'Anad-Kirsh front, our forces dealt mortal blows  to  the forces of aggression and enmity, inflicting heavy casualties  of over 200 killed and wounded. Our forces destroyed eight  enemy tanks and three Katyusha rocket launching vehicles. They  also captured three tanks and four enemy Katyusha rocket  launching vehicles. As a result of these heavy losses, the  enemy forces were forced to take flight or surrender,  particularly after realizing that the al-Ahmar gang had  literally thrust them into the fire from which there was no  escape, except through retreat or surrender.    The morale of our forces is very high, and they will win  their victory, God willing. God is great. God is great.    Issued by the command of the Armed Forces of the DRY.</p>

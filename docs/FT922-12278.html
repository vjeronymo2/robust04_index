			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / International Company News: International business helps Philip Morris to Dollars 1bn profit STRONG performances by Philip Morris's international food and tobacco operations helped it to after-tax profits of Dollars 1.09bn in the first three months of 1992. The US tobacco and food group's net profits in the same period a year ago bore the impact of a Dollars 921m charge for accounting changes. Even with this stripped out, there was an underlying increase of 19.5 per cent, from Dollars 920m, while pre-tax earnings rose 18.5 per cent to Dollars 1.91bn. Earnings per share were up by 21.2 per cent to Dollars 1.20. Despite the improvement, operating revenues fell slightly, by 1.2 per cent to Dollars 14.05bn. This reflected currency transactions and lower sales from the recession-hit food operations in North America. Its shares shaded 1/4 to Dollars 78 1/2 on the news. On the tobacco side, Philip Morris saw a 13.4 per cent operating profits advance overall, although the volume of cigarettes shipped fell by 3.5 per cent - partly because of the timing of Russian shipments. Domestic market share was put at 41.6 per cent.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 15 (XINHUA) -- Feminism is this  year's hot topic for foreign students in Beijing as the World  Conference on Women is due to be held in the city in 1995.    The Beijing Language Institute held a campus debate between  two teams of Chinese and foreign students, respectively,  recently, exploring the topic "equality between the sexes,  forever impossible?" The debate drew an audience of over 100  foreign students studying in Beijing.    The six-strong team of foreign students from the Beijing  Language Institute proved a tough rival for their Chinese  counterparts, both in the Chinese language and arguments, the  judges from the institute said.    Taking the position that men and women can never be equal,  the foreign team said that physical conditions, social customs  and division of labor will not allow real equality between the  sexes. But the Chinese team argued that as a half of the  society, women can and must play an equal role to men's.    The debate ended with an even score. Two Chinese and two  foreign students won prizes for "best debater".    The students said that they realized there is really a gap  between the rival opinions, and they learned a lot about how  different the situations in specific countries are.    It was the first campus debate between Chinese and foreign  students ever held by the institute, which was the first college  to take in foreign students for studying Chinese on the  mainland. It is the seventh consecutive year that it has  sponsored debates in the Chinese language for foreign students.</p>

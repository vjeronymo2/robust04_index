			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Stock index futures continued to provide a strong lead for the stock market yesterday, although traders were quick to point out that, at 10,592 contracts in the March FT-SE contract, turnover was relatively thin, writes Terry Byland. The contract closed at a premium of 20 points to the cash market, around 2 points to the fair value premium which allows for dividend flows and carrying costs on the underlying stocks. Futures traders characterised yesterday's performance by derivates as 'taking the line of least resistance': strong gains in continental European markets earlier this week, while London was closed, vied with renewed optimism for lower interest rates and further economic recovery in the UK as stimulating factors for the market. There were some fears that a batch of Over-The-Counter, or individually structured futures programmes might expire before the year-end, but since such deals are agreed privately between clients and securities houses, nothing could be proved yesterday. Turnover of 33,456 contracts in traded options compared with 17,367 in the half session on Christmas Eve. The FT-SE contract trade 15.073 yesterday and the Euro FT-SE headed the individual contracts list. Interest rate related stocks took pride of place in the active stocks list following reports on Christmas trading at the big name retailers. Marks &amp; Spencer (2,058 contracts), and Abbey National (1,852) were immediate beneficiaries and Land Securities (1,401) and National Westminster Bank (1,030) attracted significant interest.</p>

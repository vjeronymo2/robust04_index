			<p>BFN     [Text] Santiago, 23 Jun (EFE) -- The Chilean Foreign  Ministry has confirmed that the eight Cubans -- six men, one  woman, and one child -- who had been occupying the Chilean  Consulate in Havana since 15 June voluntarily left the consulate  today.    This is reported in an official communique disclosed by  Fernando Reyes Matta, Chilean Foreign Ministry Cultural and  Information Affairs Department director.    The text of the communique states: "Through its Foreign  Ministry, the Cuban Government has offered guarantees to the  Chilean Government that these people will not be subjected to  reprisals because of their illegal entrance into the consulate  building. It also made assurances that this incident would not  be used as an aggravating circumstance in any possible pending  cases that these persons could be prosecuted for."    The communique adds: "Before their departure from the  Chilean  Consulate, the eight persons handed a declaration to the Chilean  consul general, Ambassador Patricio Pozo Ruiz, in which they  state that they are voluntarily leaving the consulate office.  They also express their gratitude for the treatment they  received during their stay."    The Chilean Government's official declaration concludes by  stating: "In addition to expressing its satisfaction over the  resolution of the situation affecting our consular mission and  the cooperation rendered by Cuban officials, the Foreign  Ministry wishes to explain that the consulate general offered  protection exclusively for humanitarian reasons; and therefore  under no circumstance should this action be interpreted as a  granting of asylum, which was uncalled for in this case."    Chilean President Eduardo Frei and Cuban President Fidel  Castro had discussed the situation created by the entrance of  eight Cubans into the Chilean Consulate in Havana during a  meeting held within the framework of the recent Fourth  Ibero-American Summit in Cartagena, Colombia.    During a news conference, Castro stated that the issue was  subject to the negotiations undertaken by the foreign ministries  of the two countries.    In Santiago, official Chilean sources had stated that the  situation could continue because in view of the previous  occupations of the Belgian and German Embassies, the Cuban  Government had announced it would not issue exit permits. There  was hope, however, of finding a solution prior to Cuban Foreign  Minister Roberto Robaina's visit to Chile, which is scheduled to  take place in August.</p>

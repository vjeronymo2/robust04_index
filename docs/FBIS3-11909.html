The mouthpiece of the Cuban Workers Federation (CTC) carried  an article signed by writer and journalist Nicanor Lomplcotayt,  an expert on U.S. issues, stating that the end of the siege of  the island is neither in sight nor as distant as the most  pessimists predicted.    Since Washington lifted the blockade against Vietnam, a  country in which it lost over 60,000 soldiers during the imposed  war in the 1960's, many ask if now the White House will end the  blockade it has implemented against Cuba for over 30 years, the  article comments.    It added that, when resuming the increasingly longer list of  those who oppose the blockade, the Miami newspaper EL NUEVO  HERALD said in its 7 March edition:    "From religious and humanitarian organizations to  conservative editorialists, and from civil rights groups to  business managers, the different critics of the trade embargo  assert it is a Cold War relic which affects U.S. businesses or  contributes to the island's poverty."    The situation is compounded by the start of the House of  Representatives debates on the issue. Regardless of the  results, it proves the extent of the internal criticism that  this behavior has earned. In addition to other signs of  international rejection, the UN Assembly General has issued two  resolutions expressing its disapproval, TRABAJADORES emphasized.    If the decision to lift the embargo against Vietnam proves  the U.S. businessmen's realism managed to displace the dogmatism  and mental anachronism of a group of officials and congressmen,  in Cuba's case I believe they could very well play a crucial  role, Leon Cotayo said.</p>

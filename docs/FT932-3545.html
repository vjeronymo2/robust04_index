			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / Pension members 'denied voice' NEARLY HALF of the smaller pension schemes for British companies give their members no say in the appointment of trustees, a survey released today shows. Nearly two fifths of schemes rely on circulating only summarised accounts to members and a quarter provide accounts only if specifically requested. The details come in a survey of 67 pension schemes with assets of Pounds 1m to Pounds 50m produced by accountants Clark Whitehill.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vicente Briceno from the "Union Radio News" </F> newscast]    [Text] Defense Minister General Rafael Montero Revette this  Thursday rejected rumors of a new coup attempt in the country.  In this regard, he said the unequivocal task within the military  organization is to work for Venezuela, adding that that is why  there is no talk about military rebellion within the Armed  Forces. Montero also indicated that those implicated in the 4  February and 27 November 1992 coup attempts were pardoned and  some of them reinstated in the Armed Forces.    Admitting that the country's situation is difficult, General  Francisco Visconti, one of the leaders of the 27 November 1992  coup attempt, said that the conditions for a new coup in  Venezuela do not exist. The high-ranking military officer, whose  case was dismissed in exchange for his discharge from the Armed  Forces, was received by President Caldera, whom he thanked for  the peace process implemented in the military. Wearing the  typical blue Air Force uniform with his brigadier general rank,  Visconti asked the president to ensure that the aeronautics  experience of the high-ranking officers who will retire 5 July  be used in the most efficient and productive manner for the  country.    Admitting that the country's crisis is deep, the coupist  military officer asked for a vote of confidence for the  president, whom he described as a man with the morals and  professionalism to lead Venezuela. He added that this task  cannot be carried out by only one person, rather a highly  qualified human team.    [Begin Visconti recording] We have said that this is a very  difficult task, which requires our cooperation. Consequently,  the commitment is not to Dr. Caldera but to ourselves,  Venezuelans, and our fatherland, which must overcome the  existing crisis. [end recording]    Although he thinks that commander Hugo Chavez Frias has the  right to make proposals, Gen. Visconti said that he will not  constantly criticize the administration as Chavez has been doing.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Black Sea Fleet ships stationed in Sevastopol,  for instance the Admiral Golovko rocket cruiser, are being  urgently supplied with armaments. This was announced to  INTERFAX-Ukraine by Chief of the Ukrainian Navy press center,  Nikolay Savchenko. He said the ships were prepared for military  action.    Savchenko also announced that several Ukrainian fleet ships,  for instance the Getman Sagaidachny patrol ship and the Lutsk  antisubmarine cruiser had not been supplied with electric power  from the land. The Black See Fleet's command explained this by  nonpayment for electric power already delivered. However, the  Ukrainian Navy financial service said Kiev had no debts.</p>

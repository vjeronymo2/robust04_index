			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / International Company News: Ferruzzi unit bids for Heracles Cement CALCESTRUZZI of Italy, part of the Ferruzzi group, has made the only firm bid for Heracles General Cement, Europe's largest cement exporter, which is the main attraction in Greece's privatisation programme. The Italian group, bidding in partnership with the state-owned National Bank of Greece, has offered Dr107bn (Dollars 575m) for a 69 per cent stake in Heracles held by the Industrial Reconstruction Organisation (IRO), the state holding group for companies being denationalised. If the bid is accepted, a new company, Calnat, will be set up to manage Heracles, in which Calcestruzzi will have a controlling interest, according to IRO officials. The other short-listed bidder, Italcementi, one of the largest Italian cement producers, failed to submit a binding offer by the February 21 deadline. However, Italcementi later offered to pay a higher price, reportedly around Dr120bn, but on condition that National Bank gives up its alliance with Calcestruzzi. Co-operation with National Bank is considered essential because of a claim by Heracles' former managers that the nationalisation procedure which was followed in 1983, involving a compulsory capitalisation of Dollars 27bn in debt,violated European Community directives on company law. The European Court is in agreement with the claim, but the case is likely to drag on for several years. If the nationalisation is eventually reversed, IRO will lose its equity holdings in Heracles and National Bank will become its largest shareholder. Heracles, which is listed on the Athens Stock Exchange, is one of the few profit-able companies in the Greek privatisation programme. Earnings for 1991 are expected to total Dr6.1bn on turnover of more than Dr50bn.</p>

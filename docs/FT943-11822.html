			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / MPs urge early lifting ofban on BT video service British Telecommunications should be allowed to offer video-on-demand and home shopping on a UK 'electronic superhighway' before the end of the decade, a House of Commons committee said yesterday. That is one of the radical changes in the regulatory regime for broadcasting and telecommunications called for by the trade and industry select committee to ensure the rapid construction of such a network. The key recommendation of its report on optical-fibre networks is for a progressive lifting of the ban on BT using its network to carry entertainment services. Existing government policy, designed to encourage investment in local cable systems by cable operators competing with BT, is for the ban to stay in place until at least 2001, with a review at some stage after 1998. Yesterday's report advocates a gradual lifting of the ban over an 8-year period. BT would be allowed to compete on an equal footing with cable companies over most of Britain by the late 1990s, with a complete lifting of the ban in 2002. Mr Richard Caborn, chairman of the Commons committee, claimed that without a clear date for ending the ban Britain could lag behind the US and Japan in the development of interactive 'superhighway' services. 'The potential now exists for an enormous range of new services,' he said, highlighting home-based services such as video-on-demand and home shopping and community-based services such as interactive teaching and medical facilities in schools and hospitals. It appeared yesterday that Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, would refuse any immediate change in government policy. The Department of Trade and Industry said that it would formally respond to the report in the autumn. However, the cable industry gave a guarded welcome to the report. Mr Richard Woollam, director-general of the Cable Television Association, which represents the - mostly US-owned - cable companies building local networks, said: 'I don't think anyone in the cable industry really expected the ban to go on beyond 2001.' This raised the prospect of a broad industry consensus on a raising of the BT ban which could make it easier for Mr Heseltine to set a firm date for its abolition. The report's recommendations are broadly in line with Labour party policy. BT, which campaigned hard for an early lifting of the ban, welcomed the report, noting that the proposal to restrict the period of protection from BT competition in entertainment services for individual cable franchises would free BT to compete over most of the country by 1998. It said it had the Pounds 15bn necessary to extend fibre-optics into local networks if the ban was lifted. BT results, Page 20</p>

			<p><P> January 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORRISON'S LEGACY  </P> <P> What has happened to Calendar? It used to be full of one-or-two-page articles  about interesting people doing interesting things. It now reads endlessly of  wastrels whose lives, by their hedonistic self-destructive behavior, offer  little or nothing of benefit to society and are best ignored or forgotten.  </P> <P> The latest example is "Jim Morrison: Back to the Sixties, Darkly" by Pat H.  Broeske, Jan. 7.  </P> <P> I resent seven pages wasted on this erratic downbeat loser whose baseness  destroyed his life by age 27, when there are so many worthwhile people doing  great things who could use an encouraging accolade, particularly at a time when  we are trying to rise above the chaos and decadence of the '60s. Fie on  director Oliver Stone and his movie.  </P> <P> JEAN BANTA  </P> <P> Hesperia  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lao </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Thailand's English language daily BANGKOK POST on 27  January carried a headline saying: Thais Claim 100 Die From  Torture After Breaking Laos' Border Law. Quoting slanderous  charges made by a Thai citizen, Mr. Anonglak Khambunruang, 23,  the newspaper reported that the said Thai citizen accused Lao  authorities of failing to look after and torturing Thai citizens  who are arrested and detained for illegally entering Laos.    The truth is that Mr. Anonglak Khambunruang was recently  detained by Lao authorities in Champassak Province for  committing violations against the laws of the Lao People's  Democratic Republic. The Lao authorities, however, later  released and sent him back to Thailand.    KPL categorically denies the allegations published by the  BANGKOK POST which irresponsibly quoted the fabricated charges  made by Mr. Anonglak Khambunruang. We hold that the slanderous  charges are baseless and have been fabricated to purely serve  certain bad elements in Thailand who are intent on undermining  the relations of friendship and good neighborliness between the  Lao and Thai peoples which are currently developing favorably.</p>

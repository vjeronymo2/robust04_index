			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Where comedy is king Cheer up, I have a joke for you. I heard it from Mr David Osborne on Tuesday. It seems that President Clinton was visiting the US Department of Agriculture. He marvelled at its long corridors, each with endless rows of offices leading to the left and right. Passing an open door Mr Clinton saw a lone official, head on his desk, sobbing. He turned to the senior USDA officer who was accompanying him and asked why. 'I don't know, sir,' came the reply. 'That man has been with us here at agriculture for 25 years. He's never complained before.' So the president put his arm around the pathetic figure and asked what was the matter. The official looked up, his face stained with tears. 'My farmer died,' he spluttered. Mr Osborne, the purveyor of this story, is co-author with Mr Ted Gaebler of Reinventing Government, the celebrated book reviewed on this page yesterday. In case you missed it, Osborne &amp; Gaebler are the currently fashionable prophets of the overthrow of bureaucracy and its replacement by entrepreneurial management. Their theme has long been in the air in Australia, New Zealand, Britain and much of the US. The duo must take the credit for capturing it. So ends the joke section for today - unless you count the British Labour party. This ageing pantomime horse is a serious comic. Four times the Tories have poured buckets of you-know-what over its head, and still it shakes its big dumb face and floppy ears and trots forlornly around the stage, legs splayed, mimicking the dances that seemed so popular in 1945. In the early 1980s, when privatisation got rolling, Labour contrived to present itself as the party of nationalisation. In the 1990s, when managerial reform of the public sector is the vogue, Labour continues to be perceived as the party of bureaucracy. This is primarily because it is regarded, with some justice, as the representative of public-sector unions. Like all parties of the left, Labour is beached by the tide that went out with the dissolution of the Communist party of the Soviet Union. There is now no place for socialism in any form. The French Socialists and the German Social Democrats have just been painfully reminded of this. All that remains of the political thought of the past 90 years is an insoluble equation. Voters demand public services of high quality, but shrink from increased taxation. It is an elaborate jest which in Britain seems designed to keep the Conservatives in power. The prime minister believes that with his citizen's charter, his opt-outs of schools and hospitals, and his transfer of civil service backroom work to self-managed agencies he has the patent on everything in Reinventing Government except the title. Labour's mission appears to be the maintenance of bureaucracies. It derides Mr Major's citizen's charter, although it can fairly claim to have originated the concept. It opposes unfettered competitive tendering, grant-maintained schools and trust hospitals. It is as if it not only missed the Osborne &amp; Gaebler bus, it never saw it coming. In short, you need not trouble yourself with calculations about what today's by-election result means for Labour, or the Liberal Democrats, or the government. The government's majority in the Commons is low whether it is 21, including Newbury, or 19, excluding Newbury. The Liberal Democrats gain nothing but pride from by-election victories; defeats bring only temporary despondency. The opposition remains split either way. A few local authorities changing political colour means little now that the Tories have stripped so much power from the counties. Our politicians are caught in a monstrous trap, set by Fate. Let me explain. The Conservatives have adopted only the parts of the anti-bureaucratic book that suits them. In the US the idea that governments should steer not row - that they should lay down policy, but contract out its execution to entrepreneurial units - is pluralistic. Americans elect thousands of 'governments', federal, state, and local. All are ready and able to steer events within their own areas. All are scrutinised by statute; all have to perform their duties in the open. That is the law. In Britain there is one driving seat. Power belongs to Whitehall. The prime minister directs a huge fleet of appointed boards and committees, an archipelago of patronage. As to open government, don't make me laugh. This difference between the British polity and the American one has been noted by Professor Norman Lewis of Sheffield University in How to Reinvent British Government, a pamphlet published this week*. 'It would be hypocrisy to condemn the failure of command economies but to retain all power at the centre,' he writes. Britain's political system is 'heavily over-centralised, closed, and has produced a crop of policy failures in recent times that, in all probability, cannot be matched.' Prof Lewis likes the Osborne &amp; Gaebler medicine, but understandably finds fault with the patient. Quite right too. When anyone complains that the Tories have centralised power, they protest that they have devolved it directly to where it is exercised - to individual school boards, for example. Parents vote by choosing schools, thus showing real preferences. It is now clear that this is a mandarins' confidence trick. If elected local governments devolved responsibility to autonomous school boards, or if the boards themselves were elected, that would be decentralisation. What we actually have is the opposite. The Labour party understands half of this. Proposals to re-establish local government and create regional authorities will be discussed at its policy conclave this weekend. The trap that Fate has constructed for Labour is that the more it talks of such constitutional reforms, the more it will be accused of establishing new bureaucracies. This is at least partly its own fault - it cannot talk convincingly of steering not rowing. For that means allowing entrepreneurial executives  - independent hospital management boards, for example - to shed unnecessary employees and make those who remain work harder. The unions will not permit it. The penalty for Labour is that it is still seen as the party of one ministry agriculture official per farmer. * European Policy Forum, 20 Queen Anne's Gate, London SW1H 9AA</p>

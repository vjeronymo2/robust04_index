			<p>BFN     [Text] If the Primorye territorial administration decides  to dump radioactive wastes into the Pacific, it will grossly  violate the law on nature conservation, head of the State Atomic  Inspection Committee's department for the radioactive security  of defense facilities, Nikolay Shapovalenko, told Interfax.    A representative of the Primorye administration announced  last Thursday that liquid radioactive waste might be dumped into  the sea, given the critical condition of the TNT-5 and TNT-27  storage ships.    To quote Shapovalenko, a mobile rectification system with a  handling capacity of 0.5 cubic meters per hour is to be built in  the Far East.    After such a system is put into operation, a stationary  facility with a handling capacity of 2.5 cubic meters per hour  will be built. Besides that, an enterprise manufacturing  sorbents is to be built in the Far East.    Shapovalenko also said that 114 billion rubles will have to  be spent on solving the problem of liquid radioactive wastes in  the Primorye Territory. However, the government has not  allocated anything to it so far.    The know-how which has been proposed by Japan and which the  local administration would like to have consumes almost 100  times more energy and will require an investment of about $50  million, said Shapovalenko.    The Maritime Territory is experiencing a dire shortage of  energy. Meanwhile, if the Japanese project is accepted, a  thermal electric power plant costing nearly as much as the  entire rectification facility, will have to be built.    Moreover, Russia will be entirely dependent on the Japanese  suppliers.    According to the State Atomic Inspection Committee, the  condition of the TNT-5 ship, built back in 1960, is particularly  serious. This tanker was to be written off in 1992, but to this  day it stores 400 cubic meters of low-level liquid radioactive  wastes. ``It may sink any moment right at the moorage,'' said  Shapovalov.</p>

			<p><P> September 8, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FESTIVAL '90  </P> <P> Highlights of Los Angeles Festival's films and videos focusing on 25 Pacific  Rim countries are reviewed here:  </P> <P> The Abandoned Field -- Free Fire Zone  </P> <P> Vietnam  </P> <P>  Airs tonight at 10:30 on KCET-TV; screens Monday at 6 p.m., Los Feliz Theater  </P> <P>  Nguyen Hong Sen's lyrical "The Abandoned Field -- Free Fire Zone" (1979) tells  of a young couple with a baby who live in a simple hut built on the edge of a  vast marsh. Our first impression is that the couple are living an idyllic  existence in a beautiful Garden of Edenlike setting.  </P> <P> But this is quickly dispelled as we discover that U.S. helicopters constantly  attack the area, attempt to turn it into a no-man's land in preparation for an  assault on the Mekong Delta. The couple, in turn, serve as liaisons for the  Viet Cong, which allows us to see just how ingenious and implacable guerrilla  warfare can be. KEVIN THOMAS  </P></p>

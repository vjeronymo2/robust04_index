			<p><P> September 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Though it may not rank with "Miami Vice" or "In the Heat of the Night," I find  "Hunter" to be a well-written, well-acted and fast-moving series. Fred Dryer is  excellent, as is Stepfanie Kramer.  </P> <P> Gary Traxler, North Hollywood  </P></p>

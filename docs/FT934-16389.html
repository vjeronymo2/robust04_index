			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / Foreign Exchange: Dollar recaptures lost ground THE US dollar regained some of its early losses yesterday as investors took a more balanced view of events in Russia and hopes of positive US economic data at the end of the week, writes Peter John. It weakened against the D-Mark in early European trade, hitting DM1.6140 at one stage and settling at DM1.6173 at the midday price fixing in Frankfurt. From there it rallied strongly throughout the afternoon as the market looked towards the publication of non-farm payroll figures - the most important monthly business indicator in the US - on Friday. The rally was further helped by encouraging housing figures - US housing completions for August rose 11.3 per cent after a revised fall of 6.4 per cent in July - and by the close in London the dollar had ticked back up to DM1.6235, barely changed on the day. It also pulled back more than a cent from an early low against the pound to close at Dollars 1.5170 in London, against Dollars 1.5150 on Monday. The US currency has slumped from just under DM1.75 at the time of the collapse of the European exchange rate mechanism at the beginning of August and by mid-September it had reached a low of DM1.5860. The fall was fuelled by growing nervousness over the state of the economy. Since then, dealers have decided that the currency was oversold and there has been a technical rally. The D-Mark joined an across-the-board rise in German financial markets as the country breathed a general sigh of relief that the status quo in Russia appeared to have been restored: the DAX index gained more than 2.5 per cent to close at a record high and bund futures rose nearly half a percentage point at best. The currency held sway in Europe reflecting a belief that the German Bundesbank will not reduce key interest rates at its council meeting tomorrow. However, it had already risen strongly against the dollar on Monday in response to President Yeltsin's victory and the rally proved unsustainable. Sterling failed to respond to indications coming from the Tory party conference in Blackpool that the government would not instigate a politically inspired interest rate cut but regained earlier D-Mark losses to close marginally firmer at DM2.4625, up from DM2.4600 previously. The Canadian dollar, which has been very badly hit ahead of general elections on October 25, recovered earlier losses. On Monday, in spite of intervention from the Bank of Canada, the Canadian dollar broke through CDollars 1.34 against its US equivalent for the first time June 1987. Yesterday, it opened at CDollars 1.3373. The Japanese Yen responded to positive comments by Mr Yasushi Mieno, the governor of the Bank of Japan, and ignored the latest current account figures which showed that, in Yen terms, exports were down by 13 per cent against the same time last year. It rose slightly to Y105.50 against the dollar.</p>

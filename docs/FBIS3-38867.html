			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Thierry Fiorilli: "Belgians Insist on Right To </F> Intervene"]    [Text] Brussels -- The Belgians defend the principle of the  right to intervene on humanitarian grounds. They approve of  Belgium's participation in humanitarian missions. They want  Belgian UN troops to remain in Bosnia and they consider it  vital that their resources be increased. However, they reject  recourse to air strikes except in the event of legitimate  self-defense.    The survey carried out by Survey &amp; Action -- which  monitors  the evolution of Belgian society -- shows the Belgians to be a  generous people refusing to resign themselves to impotence.  Here we publish the results of the survey exclusively for the  French-speaking press.    According to the survey, 71 percent of Belgians considered  it  normal for the "international community to intervene with  military resources to try to put an end to armed conflict and/or  to protect the civilian victims of the war." Moreover, 62  percent approved of Belgium's intervention in Rwanda, Somalia,  and the former Yugoslavia. This is an enormous proportion and  is surprising when you consider that the effectiveness of the UN  troops and the blue helmets has been and remains highly  controversial, especially where Somalia and Bosnia are concerned.    Also surprising was the wish expressed by more than half of  the Belgian people (53 percent) to see the number of our troops  in the current Balkan quagmire maintained, or even increased.  While the debate about the withdrawal or retention of UN troops  rages on, especially in France, just three Belgians in ten were  in favor of our troops pulling out or for their numbers to be  reduced.    Does what is at stake in the former Yugoslavia justify the  loss of Belgian life? A very large minority said yes (41  percent), while 49 percent replied no. In effect, two people in  five thought that a Belgian could die for Bosnia or to avoid the  conflict from spreading.    The consensus resurfaced on the question of the UNPROFOR [UN  Protection Force] resources. A very clear majority (73 percent)  considered that resources should be strengthened, while just 7  percent believed them to be sufficient. Consequently six  Belgians in 10 (57 percent) considered that Francois  Briquemont's request to step down was an expression of his  disapproval of this shortage of resources, believing that "the  UN bureaucrats sent him to the front defenseless." Moreover, 46  percent judged that the general was right to resign.    In addition, 43 percent would, if they had the power,  authorize the UNPROFOR to use force in the event of it being  attacked. This is what Briquemont wanted.    What of possible systematic western air strikes? Those  against were in the majority (59 percent), judging that bombing  operations (especially of Serbian artillery positions) would be  ineffective and morally unjustified. This refusal did not  appear to be widely inspired by the fear of major UNPROFOR  losses (14 percent). However, a little more than three Belgians  in 10 (34 percent) were in favor of systematic bombardment, even  if (17 percent) they led to heavy losses among the UN forces.    In its conclusions, the survey institute explained this  movement with regard to Bosnia primarily by what it called the  "Briquemont effect" and the wide media coverage of the conflict.  Speaking about a war and constantly showing images of it serves  to remind people of its existence. It might also revive the  pacifist issue through "a search for a new direction," and  "the...disillusionment of a society that has lost its unifying  values...."</p>

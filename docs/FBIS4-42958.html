			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Christophe Boval: "Europe Dependent on Member </F> States for Control on Subsidy Allocations"]    [Text] The European Commission (EC) has knowledge of 16  billion Belgian francs [BFr] in illegally allocated subsidies or  lost revenue in 1993. This amount represents 0.5 percent of the  European budget and is just the tip of the iceberg. Estimates  indicate that in fact 10 percent of European subsidies have been  improperly allocated, of which a fraction only has been  recovered. In the last 20 years, only just over 10 percent of  identified fraud in the agricultural budget has been recovered.    The principal explanation for these poor results is that  responsibility for combating fraud lies in the first instance  with the national authorities. They alone have the police  services and legal apparatus, carry out checks in the field, and  notify the EC of cases of fraud. Although the Treaty of  Maastricht expressly states that European states should combat  fraud involving European money just as stridently as fraud  involving their own money, in practice they put their own  interests first.    This is especially true as far as subsidies from the  structural funds for regional and social development are  concerned. In this case, control is exercised by the very same  authorities that request the money. Proposals to give the EC  more powers in this area have encountered the opposition of  member states, primarily Great Britain where politicians are  nevertheless frequently given to complaining of fraud in the  European Union (EU).    The EC's role is thus limited to coordination, support, and  encouragement. Whenever an EC official is present on the spot,  it is always announced in advance and he is accompanied by a  national civil servant. The member states had even planned to  trim the EC's antifraud budget, but the European Parliament put  a stop to that. This year, as many as 50 experienced  investigators may be involved in following up suspected fraud,  which is nothing compared to the scale of the problem.    The second problem is the complexity of many regulations and  directives. They virtually amount to an invitation to find the  loopholes. Agricultural policy, which still swallows up half  the EU budget, has certainly not been made any more transparent  since the reforms. Europe has a budget for everything, from  grants for suckling cows up until guaranteed prices for  carcasses at a fixed weight, compensation for fallow land  included. More limited policy areas, such as culture and  consumer protection, are also teeming with subsidy  possibilities. To be honest, obscure money transfers do not  only occur in Europe.  <H5>  Telephone Number </H5>   A third problem is the lack of cooperation between national  authorities. In order to know whether products really have been  exported to a third country, they are dependent on documents  from that third country. This is not always a simple matter.  But even within the EU member states, the cooperation is far  from perfect, and border controls have disappeared. There is no  uniform definition of what exactly constitutes fraud of the  agricultural budget and sanctions are not uniformly applied.    Faced with these problems, the EC is now seeking to appeal  to  the people themselves. It is planning to set up a free call  number where citizens can report on suspected fraud while  enjoying total anonymity.</p>

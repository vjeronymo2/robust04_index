A regular two-day meeting on semiconductor trade in Hawaii  ended with Japan partially agreeing with U.S. calls to help  boost sales of its chips to the automobile, telecommunications  and game equipment industries. Both sides agreed to promote  cooperation on developing chips from the design stage.    The United States did not make any request for a new  numerical target to measure the share of foreign chips in the  Japanese market.    Foreign semiconductor makers won more than the targeted 20  percent of the market, stipulated in an earlier agreement, in  the final quarter of last year.    After the talks, however, U.S. Assistant Trade  Representative  Donald Phillips said that although he will not be asking for new  numerical targets, a steady rise in U.S. market share is  desirable.    The U.S. said large Japanese firms with a big need for  semiconductors are not making an effort to buy U.S. chips. They  called for Japanese automobile and telecoms firms such as Nippon  Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT) to be represented at the  next round of talks.    Japan insisted that major users are fully cooperating in  buying U.S. chips, and said U.S. makers are neglecting the  Japanese market and instead concentrating on the growing U.S.  domestic market.</p>

The official national news  agency said the mission led by a presidency member of the second  largest political party in the Federal Republic of Germany will  meet with top authorities of the Santiago de Cuba Province,  located some 950 km east of Havana.    Tappae, who is also a member of the German Bundestag  (parliament), told the media that during his one-week visit to  Cuba, he will seek to obtain firsthand knowledge of the Cuban  situation after changes in the world. He pointed out that he is  especially interested in exploring the possibility of increasing  political ties between northern Hessen and Santiago de Cuba.  According to Tappae, although northern Hessen and Santiago de  Cuba are physically distant from each other, they share some  similarities in their historic backgrounds and various economic  activities.    The agenda includes touring production, cultural,  scientific,  and recreative centers, a visit to the mining community of El  Cobre, which is one of the oldest in Cuba, as well as meetings  with government and political authorities.</p>

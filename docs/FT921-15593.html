			<p>920109 FT  09 JAN 92 / Delors proposes EC summit on financial plans A SUMMIT of European Community states could be called in April to discuss the Community's financial plans, Mr Jacques Delors, the European Commission president, said in Lisbon yesterday. Speaking after the first meeting between the Portuguese government and the EC Commission to discuss priorities for the Portuguese EC presidency, Mr Delors said proposals for a financial package would be presented for discussion by mid-February. This would outline the Community's budgetary and financial commitments for the period 1993-97. He hoped 'an extraordinary summit in April would make it possible' to agree on the package. He said it would include proposals designed to create a 'favourable environment (to strengthen) the competitiveness of European industries'. This was all the more important as the world faced the challenge of important industrial restructuring and big changes in the international division of labour. He said the Commission would outline proposals on competition, on co-operation in research and suggest measures to accompany industrial restructuring, especially with regards to its social implications and on training policies. Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva, the Portuguese prime minister, was more circumspect on prospects of holding the summit in April, saying it would depend on the 'positive' outcome of discussions after the presentation of the new package. Mr Cavaco Silva also emphasised Portugal's determination to help find a compromise in the Uruguay Round of world trade talks which are threatened by disagreements between the EC and the US. He said the presidency would also strive to ensure that social policies would be seen to be an important element in the development of the Community. 'We want to ensure that the social dimension is a reality in the Community,' he said. Mr Delors said enlargement would have to be discussed during the six-month Portuguese presidency but that it was too early to talk of a timetable.</p>

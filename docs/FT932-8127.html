			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / Technology: Modern methods in the pipeline - British Gas engineers are revolutionising east German home energy provision Graham Moore started working on converting Leipzig in east Germany from manufactured, dirty town gas to natural gas 25 years to the day after he began the process in Burton-on-Trent in the UK. While it took four years to convert Britain to North Sea gas, Moore hopes that, by next year, he and teams of British Gas engineers working with west German energy companies will have finished converting east Germany to natural gas from Russia. 'We had more information about our customers when we started the conversion in the UK than we have here now,' says Moore, who is a director of two regional distribution companies in east Germany: Gasversorgung Sachsen-Anhalt (GSA) and Gasversorgung Leipzig (GvL). 'We need to do 10 years' worth of improvements here in two years.' British Gas engineers are helping to extend the east German gas grid into rural outposts, while marketing colleagues try to convince east German distribution companies to adopt a friendlier approach to customers. British Gas has won 25 new contracts to revamp the east German gas business this year following its acquisition of stakes in the two distribution companies two years ago. Along with west German energy partners, British Gas has run the two distributors since they were privatised by the Treuhand agency. British Gas has invested DM70m (Pounds 28.4m) developing the two gas companies and plans a further DM30m until 1997. Its German subsidiary expects a turnover of DM30m this year - double last year's level of DM12.5m  -and wants 50 per cent growth next year. A priority for the distribution companies is to update the local gas grid so that natural gas from Russia and elsewhere can be carried to replace the manufactured town gas. British Gas has also taken a strategic 5 per cent stake in Verbundnetzgas, the east German gas transit company which carries Russian gas to local distribution companies. Moore's experience of converting the UK to natural gas is vital in setting targets and priorities for the east German companies. British Gas has introduced computer technology that helps with the planning of gas networks and pipeline routes. This helps estimate the costs for a specific project. One of the main tasks of western managers in the east German gas companies is to establish priorities. 'We've got to decide where we're going and how to get there. We agree that conversion from town gas comes first, and then we work on extending the network,' Moore says. The company plans to complete conversion to natural gas by the middle of next year. Initially, the utilities expected the conversion process to take until 1996, but the better organisation and focus that has come with western planning methods has meant it can be completed two years earlier. A system of cost-accounting - highlighting for managers where they are spending money and where they need to cut costs - has helped east German companies target their investment. Once projects get under way, British Gas can offer the cost-saving technology it has used on similar work in the UK. The company is also using its swage-lining process for plugging leaks in the cast-iron old pipes - lining the old ones with a plastic skin without taking the pipes out of the ground. UK contracting companies, such as Steve Vick, are moving into Germany to carry out work for British Gas. Steve Vick is using a rotamole system of boring underground to lay gas pipes, which is cheaper and quicker than digging up roads and causes less upheaval. British Gas has also developed technical improvements to the way it digs trenches for laying pipe. With equipment such as a rock-wheel, mole-plough and chain trencher, the company has speeded up its trenching operations. The rock wheel, which has teeth that dig into the road surface, can lay pipes at up to 200 metres in an hour. The company's efforts to link new parts of east Germany to the gas grid are being rapidly outstripped by demand. Moore explains how British Gas is able to tap into a vast unsatisfied demand for gas supply, adding around 15,000 new customers a year and converting 125,000 customers to natural gas last year. 'The inquiry level is unprecedented, especially compared with the UK, where we have to give up market share.' British Gas is being forced by its regulators to shed part of its market in the UK to encourage the development of competition. The company has tried to win new customers by overhauling the east German approach to customer service. One of the hardest tasks has been to convince their east German colleagues that customers have a right to know what the companies are planning to do and when. 'Part of our marketing drive has been to create a positive image for natural gas by stressing its environmental advantages over town gas and brown coal,' says Paul Roberton, planning manager of distribution and transmission at GSA. Natural gas is cheaper for customers who use it for heating, but slightly more expensive for those using it just for cooking. But there is a high degree of awareness about the environment in east Germany and a lot of interest in environmentally friendly products. 'Before, all the east Germans could do was to fend off demand for gas - you could only get a supply by queueing at the energy ministry for hours and proving you had special needs, such as lots of children, or worked shifts,' says Moore. 'Customers are amazed to see us coming to their villages with a mobile office and information packs about what we're going to do and when.'</p>

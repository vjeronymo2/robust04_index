			<p><P> June 17, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE CASE FOR O.C.;  </P> <P> BEHIND THE ORANGE CURTAIN  </P> <P> THE AGE of 4, I had the good sense to pack my family out of Los Angeles and  move south to Orange County. My dad grumbled and my mother was shocked, but my  brother and sister were all for it. After all, we were the future, weren't we?  That was 32 years ago, and I haven't looked back. since. Even if I had, not  much would have been visible, because the L.A. smog is so bad you need an LAPD  battering ram to get through it.  </P> <P> Live in Los Angeles? You've got to be kidding. Let's compare the basics.  </P> <P> THE PEOPLE: There's one fundamental difference between L.A. people and Orange  Countians. L.A. people all want to be someone else. Look at them, and, as Jim  Harrison has written, "see the folly whirling in their eyes." The waiters all  want to be novelists; the novelists all want to be screenwriters; the  screenwriters all want to direct; the directors all want to produce; the  producers all want to keep the other guys relegated to net participation and  guild minimums. Don't believe me? Go to a Laker game. Pat Riley wants to be  Michael Douglas. Jack Nicholson wants to be Magic Johnson. Dyan Cannon wants to  be in high school again, mesmerizing bleachers full of male adolescents with  crack pompon work and bouncy wiggles.  </P> <P> Now take Orange Countians. We know who we are. The blandly handsome, heavily  mortgaged, marathon-running, aerospace department manager, driving to work in  his Taurus, does not entertain dreams of movie making. He has weapons to build,  a country to defend, a family to provide for. Or take the blond mall rat, age  16, with her squeaky voice and her eyes aflame with consumer fever. She doesn't  secretly wish to be Michelle Pfeiffer. She has actually never heard of Michelle  Pfeiffer.  </P> <P> The loose-jawed surf dude in Huntington Beach entertains not a single thought  besides the next south swell, south being to his left, he's pretty sure, if  he's facing the gnardical tubes of the Pacific, which he usually is.  </P> <P> THE PLACE: Be honest, now. Would you rather spend your day in Laguna Beach or  at the La Brea Tar Pits? Would you rather drive Pacific Coast Highway with the  top down and your radio blasting or sit on Interstate 10 and watch the Boyle  Avenue exit inch by while you wonder which of these other gridlocked sociopaths  is going to pop off a couple .44 magnum rounds at you? Would you rather stroll  amid the abject hideousness of Venice Beach (even the beaches want to be  somewhere else!) or settle down with a dry martini in a bar with a view of  Newport Harbor, the Pacific, Catalina Island, and no waiters named Darrel who  want to act? Would you rather sit in a quiet patio in the Modjeska Canyon  wildlife sanctuary and watch the birds come and go or sit in the lounge of the  Tom Bradley International Terminal, eat a stale $2.95 croissant and watch the  jets lumber through the swelling apocalyptic vapors that pass for air?  </P> <P> I'm trying to be fair here.  </P> <P> THE ATTITUDE: People in L.A. think they're ahead of Orange Countians in all  things hip and wonderful. They glow with condescension, with an arrogance that  doesn't just suggest superiority but proclaims it. A friend from L.A., visiting  me when I lived on Balboa Island (ever notice how people come to Orange County  to get out of L.A., but never the other way around?), remarked that he was  surprised to see such a "progressive" shampoo in my shower. It mattered to him  where my shampoo registered on the hipness scale. We walked the campus at UC  Irvine, where I was a student, and his Bruin nose, high in the air, sniffed at  the "sterility" it sensed there. Later, we took my tiny sailboat (a two-man  Sears Whirlwind) into Newport Harbor, where my friend gestured at the passing  boats and remarked that the Marina del Rey yachts were far more "seaworthy than  gaudy, like these things." Orange Countians have more sense than to fall for  most of the embarrassing trends that flourish in L.A. For instance, nouvelle  cuisine was a conspicuous and stunning flop in Orange County restaurants. For  instance, attractive young women in Orange County have the guts and imagination  to wear something other than Wayfarers and black leather. For instance, no man  in Orange County, even in the sartorial nightmare of the early 1970s, ever wore  a pair of goddamned clogs. Those were relegated to L.A., in a parade of  unrepentant high-silliness from which the city has yet to recover.  </P> <P> THE OBVIOUS CONCLUSIONS: Los Angeles has the dirtiest air in the nation; Orange  County has no smog at all. Los Angeles traffic is rivaled only by that of  Manhattan; Orange County's freeways and surface streets bustle along at  over-the-speed-limit velocity 24 hours a day. Los Angeles is ugly. Orange  County is beautiful. People in Los Angeles all want to be someone else because  they're miserable; people in Orange County are content to be who they are  because they're happy.  </P> <P> It's clear. People in L.A. can't face reality.  </P> <P> We can.  </P></p>

			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Survey of The Philippines (6): New rules bring benefits - A more stable finance and banking sector Liberalisation of the Philippine financial sector - including the law introduced in May 1994, allowing the entry of more foreign banks into the country - has encouraged innovation and enhanced competitiveness of the local banking system. 'The move is part of this overall drive towards globalisation, which our local banks have consistently welcomed, because we have envisioned that the Philippines' economic future depends on being part of the international business community,' says Mr Rafael Buenaventura, president of the Bankers Association of the Philippines (BAP), which groups the country's private commercial banks. However, local banks, during the discussions on the banking liberalisation measure, have persistently called for a level playing-field, which includes the application of uniform rules on capitalisation and performance standards for both the existing banks and newcomers. The local banks have also called for reciprocity in the grant of benefits to the foreign banks. Pushed by Mr Buenaventura, the proposed reciprocity is intended to provide a bargaining tool for the Philippine banking sector's own efforts to penetrate foreign markets, particularly when the economy shall have grown enough that local companies will start expanding overseas. Not that the Philippine banks are uncompetitive. Since the first tentative signals from government to liberalise the economy at the start of this decade, they have been initiating their own moves to shape up. These have resulted in more stable institutions, compared with those in the early 1980s which easily wobbled when the economy ran into difficulty. Proof of this, says Mr Gabriel Singson, governor of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, the central monetary authority, is the banking system's ability to withstand severe crises, such as the recent scam in the trade of government securities in the secondary market that also involved a few commercial banks. The central bank had to make emergency financial assistance to these banks which were hit by runs on deposits. The damage, it turned out, was limited to the few banks and investment companies that got entangled in the scam. Owing to strict rules previously instituted by the monetary authority for banks involved in such types of transactions, the system emerged from that episode with only minor bruises. Even the banks that required emergency loans have started repaying Bangko Sentral. The Philippine financial sector is actually composed of a grand total of 9,937 institutions, although commercial banks, numbering 33 with a nationwide network of 2,580 branches, dominate. The commercial banks, at the end of 1993, had total resources of 864bn pesos (Dollars 38m), or 65 per cent of the total assets of the entire financial system. The commercial banks also accounted for 87 per cent of total deposits of 639bn pesos, which remain the largest sources of cash for the banking sector. There are four foreign banks operating full-service branches in the Philippines. These are Bank of America, Citibank, Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, and Standard Chartered Bank. They were already doing business in the country when the General Banking Act, which closed the industry to foreign groups, was adopted in 1948, and so were allowed to remain. Also operating in the Philippines are 17 offshore banking units (OBUs), which in 1993 had total assets of Dollars 1.57bn, including lendings of Dollars 568m. The OBUs' business volume has been declining over the past few years. Since the removal of all controls on foreign exchange current transactions in 1992 and on the opening of new branches in 1993, the domestic commercial banks have actively skewed their services and products to catch the expected gains from the liberalised environment. Technology advancements also heightened the competitive atmosphere. These factors, according to Mr Buenaventura, 'have combined to generate a marketing revolution that is pushing traditional banking into oblivion. Competition - already very keen - continues to intensify.' Current features of the local banking system which, according to Mr Buenaventura, have 'fortified their armada of innovative products and services', include: The local banks operate a widely dispersed network of automated teller machines (ATMs) that now totals 1,500 stations nationwide. Some of the ATM cards are linked internationally, enabling the Philippine depositors to access their peso and dollar accounts at home and abroad. Banks have also developed new services to to catch some of the huge remittances of Filipino overseas contract workers, which now amount to an estimated 2.4bn pesos annually, compared with 600m pesos five years ago. Philippine banks have either opened remittance centres abroad or established links with correspondent banks. In the battle for savings deposits, the banks have devised new accounts that offer yields of up to 10 and 12.5 per cent on certain minimum amounts - way above the 4-6 per cent interest rates on ordinary savings accounts. At least 28 foreign banks have applied for the 10 slots allowed for wholly foreign-owned operations under the banking liberalisation law. However, those who fail to make the cut may still come in as co-owners, of up to 60 per cent, of existing domestic banks. The implementing rules drafted by the Bangko Sentral for the banks' entry were, by end-August, being scrutinised by Congress. The rules are expected to be formalised and the foreign banks that will come in should be known before the end of 1994. A concern in the banking system is the high cost of intermediation. Owing to high reserves requirements on bank deposits, a gross receipts tax on bank lendings, and mandatory allocation of portions of their lendings for agricultural and agrarian reform programmes of the government, the banks find it necessary to pass on the added costs to their clients. The high yields on treasury bills, as the government continues to tap the local capital markets to finance its budget shortfalls, also push commercial lending rates up. Until August 15, when Bangko Sentral reduced the required reserves from 20 per cent to 17 per cent of deposit levels, domestic interest rates hovered between 17 and 21 per cent. While these rates have attracted foreign portfolio investments in sizeable amounts (which have propped up the peso), they have also limited access by local users of capital. The August 15 reduction in the reserves level has already pulled down treasury bill rates. Leading commercial banks have also cut their prime lending rates to around 13 per cent, from about 15 per cent previously. No further substantial declines are expected, however, as monetary authorities continue to be concerned about possible inflationary effects of such a move.</p>

			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Ex-Matrix chief becomes Iraq oil minister A FORMER senior Iraqi intelligence officer and one time chairman of Matrix Churchill, UK machine tool company, has become Iraq's new oil minister, writes Richard Donkin. Dr Safa al Habobi's appointment was announced on Sunday by Baghdad. Dr Habobi, 47, had been senior deputy director of the Military Industrialisation Commission for the past year. Iraqi exile sources said Habobi's prior job had been that of deputy to Hussein Kamel, Saddam Hussein's cousin, who was named ministry of industry and minerals in the new Iraqi cabinet. Mr Kamel had been in charge of Iraq's weapons programme. Dr Habobi was named in documents submitted to the inquiry by Lord Justice Scott into Britain's arms exports to Iraq, as a senior Iraqi intelligence official whose procurement activities were being monitored by MI6. He became chairman of Matrix Churchill after the Coventry company was acquired by a company in Baghdad in 1987. He has been charged in the US in connection with the Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.24bn) of illegal loans for Iraq's military build-up issued by the Atlanta branch of Italy's Banca Nazionale del Lavoro. Matrix Churchill was bought from its Iraqi owners by Automation Investments, a Midlands company, after the invasion of Kuwait and was later placed into receivership and broken up.</p>

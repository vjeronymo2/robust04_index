			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Current Affairs" program] </F>   [Text] German Cooperation and Development Minister Mr.  Carl-Dieter Spranger has concluded a working visit to Vietnam.  Following is our radio comment:    A joint press conference was held in Hanoi by Chairman of  the  State Planning Committee Mr. Dau Ngoc Xuan and German Minister  Carl-Dieter Spranger. The two ministers voiced their countries'  will to strengthen relations and cooperation in many fields  between the two countries in accordance with the potential of  each country. The German minister also briefed on the outcome  of his working visit to Vietnam. He said that Vietnam and  Germany have achieved positive progress in political, trade, and  economic areas. Over the past two years, high-level delegations  of both sides have exchanged visits. The most important has been  the visit to Germany by Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet at  the end of June last year and the visit by Vice Chancellor and  Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel to Vietnam in April last year.  The nomination of a special envoy in charge of relations  between Germany and Vietnam at the German Embassy was an  illustration of Germany's evaluation of the political importance  of Vietnam. The decision was in conformity with Germany's  foreign policy to broaden relations with Asia, the most  promising region in the world.    Commercial activities and investment between the two  countries have also increased. In 1992, the total trade  turnover between the two countries was more than 440 million  Deutch marks and this year this figure might double. At  present, Germany has invested in nine projects with a total  capital of 13 million Deutsche marks. However, German  businessmen and the German media think that the economic ties  between the two countries are not big enough in both scope and  scale in comparison with Vietnam's expectations and present  conditions, as well as Germany's economy. The German business  newspaper (HEINDORF PRESSE) commented that German business  circles were following with keen interest developments in  Vietnam and held that the process of renovation in Vietnam has  achieved positive outcome. Vietnam has a skilled labor force  with its industry and intelligence. Another favorable condition  for German businessmen was that Vietnam has 5,000 people who  studied and graduated in Germany and about 100,000 people who  work in Germany. It means that in Vietnam, the number of those  who speak German is higher than in any other Southeast Asian  country. These are factors for further development of relations  between Vietnam and Germany.</p>

			<p><P> March 10, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> 'TO THE LIMIT' TESTED LIMITS OF FILM GROUP  </P> <P> In December, 1987, Dr. Roger Nichols, the president of the fledgling Museum  Film Network, died of a heart attack.  </P> <P> "That became the moment of truth" for "To the Limit," the network's first  attempt at developing an IMAX-OMNIMAX film, said Dr. Jeffrey W. Kirsch,  executive director of the Reuben H. Fleet Space Theater, a founding member of  the Museum Film Network.  </P> <P> Each of the original six members of the 2-year-old film network, consisting of  museum and science centers from around the world, was risking hundreds of  thousands of dollars on "To the Limit," which makes its world debut March 11 at  the Fleet Space Theater.  </P> <P> Nichols, the director of the Museum of Science in Boston, had been instrumental  in bringing the group together -- and keeping it together. They were trying to  do something that had never been done before -- to work as one unit to produce  an extremely expensive, science-oriented film in the big-screen IMAX-OMNIMAX  format.  </P> <P> "His leadership ability was something quite astonishing to watch," Kirsch said.  </P> <P> Nichols sudden death left a pall on the project. The film is dedicated to him.  </P> <P> "It (Nichols death) was a stunning event for me," said Kirsch, who replaced  Nichols as president of the network. "I said I would do it because I wasn't  going to let Roger down. It energized me and made it clear the network was  going to carry through on Roger's promise" to produce the film.  </P> <P> Nichols death was the most serious of many "moments of truth" in the  development of the $3-million "To the Limit," a look at the potential of the  human body, complete with inner body photography shot with a microscopic camera  developed especially for the project.  </P> <P> The Museum Film Network was brought together to specifically address the need  for science-oriented IMAX and OMNIMAX films. "To the Limit" will be marketed  complete with a package of educational materials on the human body.  </P> <P> "The (IMAX and OMNIMAX) films being produced were travelogues or films that  exploited the medium with sensational scenes, lots of visual impact," said Dr.  Paul Knappenberger, director of the Science Museum of Virginia in Richmond.  "But there was very little in terms of scientific messages."  </P> <P> Bringing together the museums and science centers was not an easy task. Some  centers experienced in producing films, such as the Science Museum of Minnesota  based in St. Paul, refused to participate.  </P> <P> The first incarnation of the network consisted of five members -- Boston,  Chicago, San Diego, Richmond and Detroit -- then the National Museum of Natural  Science of Taiwan came on board, giving the project an international flavor.  Each was looking out for its own interests.  </P> <P> "This institution had (made films) before," Kirsch said. "But for others it was  something new."  </P> <P> Deciding on a topic was the first major source of debate. A group was hired to  research OMNIMAX audiences in different cities. The film had to be educational,  but also entertaining enough to attract an audience. Antarctica and a look at  the formation of weather were considered but eventually discarded, although  Antarctica might be used in the future.  </P> <P> "We want to use the medium to the fullest," MacGillivray said. "We don't want  to present something that can be presented equally as well on TV."  </P> <P> Nichols brought in the public broadcasting group WGBH-NOVA to serve as  co-executive producer's of the first film. NOVA's involvement gave the project  basic respectability in the science industry, in addition to a voice  experienced in the techniques and nuances of making entertaining and  educational science films. NOVA's background was especially important in  developing the inner body sequences.  </P> <P> It was the first venture into a non-television project for NOVA, the science  program specialists based with WGBH, the public broadcasting entity in Boston.  </P> <P> "It seemed to be an exciting visual challenge," NOVA Executive Producer Paula  Apsell said. "We had never worked in anything outside an 18-inch television  screen. When they were talking about a screen as big as a house we saw it was  an interesting opportunity."  </P> <P> WGBH-NOVA paid $50,000 to become an associate of the film network. In exchange,  it will receive a small share of the profits from the film.  </P> <P> "IMAX films are really a good way to help people understand what science and  technology is all about," Apsell said.  </P> <P> Even though NOVA's involvement gave the project instant credibility in the  science community, it also carried a certain mental burden for some members of  the network.  </P> <P> "It was a two-edged sword," Kirsch said. "We knew with NOVA's involvement it  would be a quality film, but some were afraid it would be too much like a PBS  film."  </P> <P> In the fall of 1987, the five original members finally signed their names to  contracts, agreeing to pay $225,000 each into the film project, with another  $300,000 in escrow. Detroit was unable to raise the $300,000 and dropped out in  October, eventually replaced by Omniversum from The Hague, Holland.  </P> <P> "Until that moment everybody was still hedging," Kirsch said.  </P> <P> Once the individual museums had approved the script, there were no more  committee reviews. Extremely conscious of the old saying about "too many cooks  . . . ," the members of the network had to agree not to get involved in the  day-to-day production activities.  </P> <P> "Another moment of truth," Kirsch said.  </P> <P> A debate enused over the production structure. Kirsch wanted a member of the  network to oversee production; Nichols thought it would be best to have someone  in charge who had experience with developing science films, mainly NOVA.  </P> <P> Eventually a compromise was reached. Kirsch and Apsell would serve as  co-executive producers with Kirsch serving as the lone link between the network  and the producers.  </P> <P> "Kirsch was responsible for communicating with me," said MacGillivray, whose  company produced such OMNIMAX favorites as "To Fly" and "Speed." "He was the  filtering system."  </P> <P> Another "moment of truth" arose when MacGillivray decided he had to go to  Russia. He wanted to focus on a ballet dancer, and after a year of research he  decided he had to have a ballet dancer from the Bolshoi Ballet in Moscow.  </P> <P> Dancers from throughout the world had been considered, including Mikhail  Baryshnikov, but MacGillivray steadfastly insisted on a female ballet dancer,  and that meant Russia. He also pointed out the marketing advantages of using  Russian footage.  </P> <P> "Going to Russia became a necessity," MacGillivray said.  </P> <P> Already, one member had dropped out of the network, the Detroit science center,  pleading lack of funds. MacGillivray's request to go to Russia, in addition to  adding mountains of red tape, was going to push the project far over the  strained budget established by the already jittery network.  </P> <P> "Greg's dedication to going to Russia pulled it off," Kirsch said. That and  MacGillivray's agreement to loan the project some of his company's money.  </P> <P> "He was so intent on it," Kirsch said. "And I think he was right. The dancer he  recorded (Nina Ananiashvili) is unbelievable."  </P></p>

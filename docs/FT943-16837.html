			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / China-Taiwan trade begins to lose momentum Growth in trade between Taiwan and China has slowed from its breakneck pace earlier this year due to China's economic clampdown and rising concern in Taipei over the risks of increasing reliance on the mainland market. According to Hong Kong customs statistics, released yesterday by Taiwan's Board of Foreign Trade, two-way cross-strait trade totalled Dollars 2.82bn (Pounds 1.85bn) between January and April, up 7.4 per cent from the same period in 1993. Two-way trade advanced at an annual rate of 25.4 per cent during the first four months of last year and 17.3 per cent for all of 1993. Taiwan bans direct transportation to China, forcing most cross-strait trade to be routed through Hong Kong. The figures are a relief to Taiwan's government, which last year began encouraging local businesses to diversify their overseas investments away from China. Mr Chiang Ping-kun, economy minister, yesterday reiterated Taipei's 'Go South' policy. This is aimed at boosting economic and trade ties with south-east Asian countries to offset dependence on China. In a government-led effort, Taiwan investors will put Dollars 300m into an industrial estate at Subic Bay, the former US naval base. Government efforts notwithstanding, analysts say the slowdown in cross-strait trade is only a respite and that the long-term trend is unstoppable. Hong Kong statistics underestimate Taiwan-China trade flows, as the volume of goods transshipped through the colony without passing through customs is growing. Prof Wea Chi-lin, a trade expert at Taiwan University, estimates 1993 two-way trade at Dollars 13bn, against an official tally of Dollars 8.69bn. Of that, Dollars 10bn is Taiwanese exports to China, representing 15 per cent of the island's total exports. This does not take into account the growing volume of goods 'smuggled' across the strait. After Hong Kong's handover to Beijing in 1997, Taiwan's exports to China will represent 30-35 per cent of the island's total exports. The figure will stabilise at 35-40 per cent by the end of the century, Prof Wea estimates.</p>

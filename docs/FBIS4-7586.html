			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Dan Maracineanu, Daniel Capatos, and Dan Damian: </F> "The Head of the SRI Counterintelligence Division Was Dismissed  Because He Collected Evidence Against Virgil Magureanu"]    [Excerpts] The recent dismissal of the head of the SRI  [Romanian Intelligence Service] Counterintelligence Division,  Major General Gheorghe Diaconescu, stirred quite an uproar among  employees who were his subordinates. As far as the reasons for  Maj. Gen. Gheorghe Diaconescu's dismissal are concerned,  numerous variations have been circulating, and the decision of  the SRI Director Virgil Magureanu are explained through  accusations of espionage against presidential counselor Marin  Pancea.    Unauthorized sources at the SRI Press Bureau told us that  the  dismissal of the head of the SRI Counterintelligence Division is  only settling accounts at the level of the SRI leadership.    In fact, it was for the first time that the reason for  Diaconescu's dismissal has been mentioned, namely: "He was  concealing documents of an intelligence nature." This is the  claim made by SRI Director Virgil Magureanu before the  Parliamentary Commission in Charge of Supervising the SRI  Activity.    In reality, it seems that Diaconescu has been in possession  of certain files according to which the SRI director, that is,  General Virgil Magureanu, and his first deputy, Maj. Gen. Victor  Marcu, were involved in certain crooked affairs that brought  them a lot of money.    Diaconescu notified the Prosecutor's Office of Romania,  namely, the deputy prosecutor general, Maj. Gen. Mihai Ulpiu  Chercheleanu, head of the Military Prosecuting Magistracy and  former prosecutor general of Romania, who sealed the file  containing the respective documents and affirmed that he is not  authorized to solve the respective issue. The SRI leadership  acted immediately and, as a result of their action, the head of  the SRI Counterintelligence Division was dismissed.    At the end of the talks that he held with the SRI director,  the head of the SRI Counterintelligence Division, Diaconescu,  warned Magureanu that it would be advisable for him not to empty  the filing cabinet, because he is able at any time to  reconstruct them from memory.  <H5>  Dismissed, Hospitalized, Released </H5>   On Friday 18 March, a Bucharest daily published an article  according to which the former head of the Counterintelligence  Division General Diaconescu is hospitalized at Bucharest  Hospital No. 9, undergoing alcoholic detoxication treatment.  More than that, the reporters of the same daily found out that  Diaconescu was being treated in a severely guarded ward and his  meals were brought to him from home.    The second day however, in the same daily that published the  aforementioned piece of news, Diaconescu himself published a  denial of the respective news.    In reality, things happened rather differently. One day  before the "bombshell" was published, SRI Director Virgil  Magureanu had a discussion with Diaconescu and ordered him to go  to a hospital. The former chief of the Counterintelligence  Division refused categorically to do so. The publication of  that piece of news, which was sent to the paper's editorial  office before learning about Diaconescu's reaction to  Magureanu's suggestion, could no longer be stopped.    Thus, the next day, the denial was published, representing  Diaconescu's right to respond to accusations.  <H5>  The Documents That Were Not Reported by Maj. General </H5> Gheorghe Diaconescu and Were Sealed by the Prosecutor's Office  Are Compromising For the SRI    After having been on active duty for over 25 years at the  head of Romanian Counterintelligence Service, Diaconescu was  dismissed from his office by SRI Director Virgil Magureanu on 15  March 1994. [passage omitted]    The dismissal of Diaconescu, head of the Counterintelligence  Division on grounds that "he failed to inform the SRI leadership  of the contents of certain documents" was generously offered to  the press by the SRI leadership because they knew that the true  reasons for this demotion will be clarified much later.    The fact that the head of the Counterintelligence Division  "held back certain documents" is not unusual. Through his duty,  Gheorghe Diaconescu could hold back not only a few but hundreds  of documents that contained information of an operational  nature, because the nature of his office allowed him to do that.    SRI sources affirm that the respective documents contained  data with "certain aspects that might have been compromising for  certain people in the SRI leadership." [passage omitted]</p>

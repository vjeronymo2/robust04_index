			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / Divided Ukraine sinks into 'hyper-depression': The patient awaiting emergency treatment FOR 10 months Mr Viktor Pynzenyk, an energetic economist in his thirties, tirelessly preached the twin gospel of fiscal restraint and privatisation to his conservative colleagues in the Ukrainian cabinet. As Ukraine's soaring inflation rate and sluggish privatisation programme attest, Mr Pynzenyk's advice usually fell on deaf ears. On Friday, he gave up. In an emotional live television address Mr Pynzenyk resigned from his post as deputy prime minister responsible for economic policy, declaring that the possibilities for introducing market reforms in the second-largest former Soviet republic had been exhausted. He said the economy was 'catastrophic'. Mr Pynzenyk was not resorting to the hyperbole beloved of resigning politicians. 'Ukraine has entered a qualitatively new stage, which is unprecedented in economic history. I call it hyper-depression,' said Mr Daniel Kaufmann, head of the World Bank mission to Ukraine. And yesterday Mr Leonid Kuchma, the prime minister, presented parliament with an emergency programme of anti-inflationary measures to prevent the total collapse of the financial system and warned of 'tragedy' ahead. Mr Kuchma called for the centralisation of all power in the government's hands, including control of the central bank. 'Emergency economic measures are absolutely vital,' he said. 'All of eastern Europe has gone through crisis. It is difficult to change a shovel into a computer.' Inflation is more than 50 per cent a month, which has pushed the value of the coupon from 2,000 to the dollar in March to nearly 6,000 in mid-August, at a time when the Russian rouble has begun to appreciate against the dollar. On top of home-grown hyper-inflation - fueled by a policy of issuing credits to agriculture and industry which have already exceeded the total gross national product predicted by the government at the beginning of the year - Ukraine has a balance of payments crisis, triggered by Russia's shift to world prices for the oil and gas upon which it has traditionally been dependent. Mr Kuchma predicts that by the end of the year the country's trade deficit will exceed Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.3bn). In the second weekend of August Mr Kuchma was on the telephone at 10 o'clock at night anxiously trying to reach the Russian prime minister to persuade him to turn on the oil taps. Russia, which is owed Rbs850bn for oil it has already supplied to Ukraine, cut off all supplies for the first 10 days of August. Informed that the Russian prime minister was en route to his dacha and could not come to the telephone, a beleaguered Mr Kuchma described Ukraine's economic predicament as 'a catastrophe'. (For the time being Russia has resumed supplying oil to Ukraine, but future supplies are uncertain.) 'With this combination of economic problems, Ukraine has only two choices: intended or unintended adjustment,' says Mr Kaufmann. Unless the government adopts radical reforms soon, 'the likelihood of a significant economic implosion is very high'. The only good news is that the Ukrainian government, which has been paralysed by internal divisions, has at last begun to grasp the seriousness of the crisis, although it is clearly still divided over what to do about it. Ukrainian leaders hope they will manage to soften the economic blow by persuading Russia - perhaps by dint of concessions over, for instance, the Black Sea fleet - to back off from its plan to raise oil prices, currently Dollars 80 a tonne, to Dollars 100 a tonne on January 1 1994. However, pragmatists in the Ukrainian government doubt Russia can be dissuaded from the shift to world prices, which the International Monetary Fund has encouraged. Meanwhile, Mr Kuchma's emergency plan will be hard to sell in cities such as Kharkiv, where massive defence enterprises such as the Malyshev factory, which built the Soviet Union's most advanced tanks but has had no military orders for more than two years, are accustomed to surviving solely on government subsidies. Kharkiv's 'red directors' spent a tempestuous two-hour meeting with Mr Kuchma recently railing against 'privatisation, commercialisation and corporatisation, which have given us nothing' and urging the prime minister to adopt a 'market' strategy 'based not on market forces but on the state'. Kharkiv's industrialists do not lack sympathisers in the Ukrainian cabinet, which earlier this month seriously debated one deputy prime minister's proposal to return to central planning. But Mr Kuchma, himself the former director of a missilefactory, warned his erstwhile colleagues that 'I must underscore that in our programme there will not be a single element which calls for a return to the command-administrative system'. Mr Kuchma's plans could also be thwarted by President Leonid Kravchuk, who is locked in a long-running political battle with his prime minister, and a parliament dominated by ex-communists. The only green shoot in the Ukrainian economic landscape - and the element which could relieve Mr Kuchma's fear that Ukraine risks becoming 'a second Yugoslavia' - is the booming agricultural sector. Ukrainian farmers are reaping a bumper harvest, expected to exceed 40m tonnes of grain. Unlike last year, when the government purchase price was less than a twentieth of world rates, this summer the Ukrainian government has been paying close to 80 per cent of the world price and farmers are responding by selling enough to the state to ensure that Ukrainian cities will not go hungry this winter.</p>

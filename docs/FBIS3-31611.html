Stevo Crvenkovski said following a meeting with his Dutch  counterpart Pieter Kooijmans that his country was prepared to  resume talks with Greece over the issue, Kooijmans's spokesman  Bob Hiensch told AFP.    The dispute between Skopje and Athens over the use of the  name Macedonia, which Greece claims belongs exclusively its own  northern province of that name, came to a head last week, when  Greece imposed and then stiffened a trade blockade against its  neighbour.    Greece has also demanded that Macedonia, a former Yugoslav  republic which gained independence in 1991 and which has since  been recognised by most other European Community countries and  the United States, stops "hostile propaganda" against Athens.  [passage omitted]    Crvenkovski, who ends a two-day official visit to the  Netherlands on Tuesday, said the Greek sanctions were bitterly  resented in Macedonia and that Greece had now closed its borders  to all traffic barring trains.</p>

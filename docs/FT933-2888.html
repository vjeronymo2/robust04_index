			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Lambert Howarth profits halved to Pounds 780,000 In spite of a 15 per cent increase in sales, pre-tax profits of Lambert Howarth showed a marked decline in the six months to end-June. The footwear supplier reported turnover of Pounds 28.6m for the period, up from Pounds 24.92m for the comparable six months. Some Pounds 2.2m of this increase reflected recent acquisitions. Pre-tax profits, however, were halved, from Pounds 1.52m to Pounds 780,000. But last year's figure had the benefit of a one-off realisation of fixed assets amounting to Pounds 263,000 and interest received of Pounds 240,000. At the operating level profits were down by Pounds 263,000 to Pounds 755,000, principally because of the impact of exchange rates. The interim dividend is being stepped up from 4.25p to 4.5p from earnings more than twice covered at 9.8p (18.9p).</p>

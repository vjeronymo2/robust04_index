			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / Buoyant car sales underline recovery REGISTRATIONS of new cars rose 11.9 per cent last month on a year-on-year basis, reassuring carmakers and traders that the recovery is still under way and that the drop in sales in April was a 'blip'. Statistics from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders yesterday were also particularly encouraging for UK-based carmakers, showing that the share of the market taken by imports fell by nearly 3 percentage points to 52.17 per cent compared with May last year. For the first five months of the year, imports took 54.03 per cent of the market, down from 54.94 in the same period last year. UK car production this year has been running at its highest level for nearly two decades. But the industry's optimism about the car market, and what it might imply for recovery in the economy overall, was tempered by continuing gloomy statistics from the commercial vehicle sector. Last month's registrations of vans, trucks and buses were down 4.45 per cent on May last year and down 4.46 per cent for the first five months of this year, even though last year was one of the worst in the commercial vehicle industry's history. May's 136,389 new car registrations, up from 121,862 in the same month last year, lifted total registrations for the first five months of this year to 725,116 - an 8.85 per cent rise on the 666,179 registrations in the same period last year. Mr Roger King, the society's director of public affairs, said yesterday: 'After the slight blip in April, when the figures slipped back by 1.9 per cent, the encouraging trend in the May registrations suggests that recovery is still under way.' May's performance means that the new car market has risen in 11 of the past 14 months. Although Ford remains the UK market leader, a feature of the May market was the strong performance put up by Vauxhall, General Motors' UK car subsidiary, which captured the first two places in the 'top 10' list of best-selling cars and increased its market share by more than two percentage points to 19.46 per cent. This was only just behind Ford's 20.55 per cent share. However, Ford is only just starting to reap the benefit of the Mondeo, which replaced the Sierra, and which won fifth place in the best sellers' list last month even though supplies are still building up. Rover, which also has yet to feel the full benefit of its new 600 range, lost ground last month. But its 13.24 per cent share of the market for the first five months is up nearly a percentage point on the same period last year. One of the most sharply improved performances last month was from the Fiat group, which showed the first signs of reversing several years of decline in the UK market. Fiat's registrations increased 46 per cent last month, and are running at 26 per cent higher for the year so far. The top 10 sellers for last month were the Vauxhall Cavalier; Vauxhall's Astra; the Ford Fiesta; the Ford Escort; Ford's Mondeo; the Rover 200 series; the Peugeot 405; the Rover Metro; Vauxhall's Corsa and the Rover 400 About 500 car windscreens are being stolen each week and this is now the fastest growing form of car-related crime, replacement windscreen company Autoglass has warned. The increase follows the introduction of a stricter MoT test which requires damaged windscreens to be replaced. Cars most at risk are those with flexible rubber windscreen surrounds. Most such cars are older variants of some top-selling models.

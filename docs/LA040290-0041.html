			<p><P> April 2, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LAKERS STILL LOOK LIKE THE BEST IN WEST BY BEATING JAZZ, 119-103  </P> <P> James Patrick Riley, only 5 years old but already well-versed in media  manipulation, stood beside his father after the Lakers' 119-103 victory over  the Utah Jazz Sunday at the Forum and was asked whether the race for the  Western Conference's best record had been decided.  </P> <P> The little Riley shook his head then buried his face behind his father's leg.  </P> <P> The Lakers were not preparing acceptance speeches for earning the home-court  advantage throughout the Western Conference playoffs, even though that now  seems inevitable. Victories over the Portland Trail Blazers on Friday night and  the Jazz on Sunday have put the Lakers (54-17) four games ahead in the loss  column with 11 to play.  </P> <P> Of course, the Lakers' sights are set on the NBA's best record. After Sunday's  easy victory, in which they made 61% of their shots and outrebounded the Jazz  by 12, the Lakers are two games in front of the Detroit Pistons in the loss  column.  </P> <P> "It's not over," the bigger Riley said. "It's up to us. If we can get through  this week coming up, if we can win those (road games) against Phoenix and  Denver, then we'll be in good shape. Because, you know, we're still pointing at  the league's best record."  </P> <P> If the Lakers play as efficiently and as inspired as they did Sunday, the  league's best record heading into the playoffs will be assured. They got 33  points and 13 assists from Magic Johnson, 25 points from Byron Scott, 23 from  James Worthy and, perhaps most important, center Mychal Thompson's 12 points,  11 rebounds and an effective defensive effort against forward Karl Malone.  </P> <P> Despite the impressive victory, the Lakers refused to talk about clinching the  West.  </P> <P> "Unless we just give it away ourselves, unless we go in the tank, and I don't  think it'll happen," said Johnson, when asked about the prospect of finishing  with the best record. "But I'm saying it could happen if we don't come out  ready to play. We can't afford a mental lapse right now. Portland, Utah and  Detroit are on our tail."  </P> <P> The Lakers have won three in a row since their 19-point loss at Portland  Tuesday night. They rebounded from that spanking by holding off the Clippers  without Johnson, then beating the Trail Blazers by 29 points on Friday night  and Utah by 16.  </P> <P> Although the Lakers still have road games at Phoenix and Denver this week, at  Utah on April 12 and at Portland on April 22, they emerged from their most  difficult week in fine shape.  </P> <P> Sunday's victory may not have been as statistically dominating as the victory  over Portland, but the Lakers took control at the start and did not let up.  </P> <P> They held Utah to eight rebounds in the first half, tying the Jazz's all-time  low for a half. Thompson draped himself over Malone and held him to seven  first-half points. Conversely, the Lakers shot 62.5% and had 18 rebounds en  route to a 15-point first-half lead.  </P> <P> Utah, which has lost two consecutive games, made the expected second-half  comeback. Malone finished with 25 points, six below his season average, and  John Stockton had 15 points and 15 assists. But the Lakers maintained at least  a 10-point lead throughout the second half. "We're trying to get prepared for  the playoffs," Johnson said. "This was a big week. We had to make some  statements against some of the best teams in the West. Our problem is that  we've been relatively consistent all year, but we haven't played really well  for long periods of time. That's what we're trying to do now."  </P> <P> There were few flaws in the Lakers' game on Sunday. Scott, who made 10 of 14  shots, was hot from the perimeter. Worthy, who made 10 of 16 shots, was  effective inside. Johnson ran the offense with his customary expertise, even  though still he was slightly hobbled by a sprained right ankle.  </P> <P> But Thompson's play, especially his first-half defense against Malone, was a  deciding factor.  </P> <P> "He is vital to us," Riley said of Thompson. "I thought the other night against  (Portland's Kevin) Duckworth and today against Malone in the first half showed  what Mychal can do. He's our best defender in the post."  </P> <P> Malone scored 12 points in the third quarter, many coming when Thompson was on  the bench. But Thompson tried to match strength with Malone and keep him from  dominating inside. Malone opened the game by making two outside jump shots and  two free throws, but Thompson was waiting for him when he ventured inside. With  4:30 left in the first half, Malone rebounded Delaney Rudd's errant jump shot  and Thompson blocked Malone's follow shot. Malone appeared surprised; that  usually does not happen to him.  </P> <P> Thompson also outrebounded Malone, 11-6, and the Laker center made six of seven  shots. Many of Thompson's baskets came on strong inside rushes or dunks on  passes from Johnson. Johnson said he had told Thompson to stop using finesse  inside.  </P> <P> "I get so mad at him because he normally doesn't do what he did today," Johnson  said, smiling. "He dunked it today, rather than missing those two- or  three-footers. I'm not really mad at him, but, you know, I just wanted to tell  him to dunk it. "Mychal doesn't get the credit for what he does. He sets the  best picks to let guys get open of anyone on the team. He and A.C. (Green) and  Vlade (Divac) have to do all the dirty work, like today against Karl."  </P> <P> The Jazz (50-21) seems more concerned with holding off San Antonio for the  Midwest Division title. The Spurs are two games behind. But Utah still harbors  hope of catching the Lakers. "Anything can happen," Stockton said. "We haven't  given up yet."  </P> <P> Malone, however, gave as close to a concession speech as anyone on either team.  </P> <P> "I'm sure everybody would like the home-court advantage, but when you lose one  home game in the playoffs, you lose the advantage, anyway," Malone said. "We've  proven we can beat (the Lakers) here before. It's going to be tough wherever  you play. This is going to be the toughest playoff race ever in the Western  Conference."  </P> <P> Laker Notes  </P> <P> James Worthy said his lower back spasms, which forced him to miss a recent  game, have subsided. "It's a lot better," Worthy said. "Now, it's just been  reduced to a sore back." . . . Jazz Coach Jerry Sloan was impressed with the  Laker defense. "It was the best defensive performance I've ever seen from  them," Sloan siad. "They went after us right at the start. They outworked us on  rebounding. They were pushing and shoving us around. They got the momentum from  the defensive play on the court." . . . The Lakers do not play again until  Thursday night against Sacramento at the Forum.  </P></p>

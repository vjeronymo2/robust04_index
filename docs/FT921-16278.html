			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / With friends like Germans . . .: John Willman finds himself more and more in tune with Nicholas Ridley I AM very fond of Germany, I like a lot of German culture and some of my best friends are German. But I am beginning to think that Nicholas Ridley was on to something in his infamous July 1990 interview with The Spectator. You will recall that he described the European Community as 'a German racket designed to take over the whole of Europe'. He rather spoilt his case with some unguarded language, not to mention strange references to German 'habits'. His blimpish attempt to link modern German politicians with Hitler's Third Reich was unforgiveable. But Ridley's description of Germany as the dominant power in the EC is hardly anything new in the economic sphere. What has happened since the Bundesbank raised interest rates just before Christmas is only the latest example of this. Almost every country in the exchange rate mechanism has followed suit and put up rates - irrespective of national economic needs. Most of Europe has accepted an unnecessary deflationary blow because Germany needed to rein in the spending party after unification. Even in the UK, the only ERM country to buck the trend, the jury is still out on whether a rise in interest rates will be necessary. If British interest rates do rise in the next few weeks, who can doubt that the decision was taken in Frankfurt rather than Great George Street? What is new is that this economic dominance is flowing into other fields - most obviously into foreign policy. A sobering example was provided by Germany's bulldozer tactics in pressing the EC for early recognition of Croatia and Slovenia, against the better judgment of most other member states. Just days after signing up at Maastricht for European political unity, Chancellor Kohl described the decision as 'a great victory for German foreign policy'. From here, it looks a good deal more like what Ridley described as a 'rushed take-over by the Germans on the worst possible basis, with the French behaving like poodles'. Then there is the EC's Social Charter, which threatens to impose German employment costs on other member states. The argument is that this will level the playing field of the internal market. But the better the pitch, the more likely it is that the stronger team will win. The price of joining the German club is agreeing to the German rules. Of course, it is hardly surprising that Europe's most populous nation should seek a political role commensurate with her economic strength. Two disastrous attempts to establish German hegemony over Europe earlier in the century by military means failed to win friends and influence people. This time, power and influence has been won without a single shot being fired, through the unbeatable combination of a stable currency and a strong manufacturing base. The resulting pax germanica is far more attractive than any tinpot empire. Newly-freed countries from the east queue to join, and the mark is already the hard currency from the Oder to the Urals. I suspect that many people in Britain would happily contract out the UK's economic management to the Bundesbank, especially if they could exchange their pounds for marks. Indeed, that is precisely what monetary union is about for most EC countries  -trading recognition of the predominance of the D-mark for a seat at the Bundesbank table. The price of that seat is agreement to German demands for a more unified political structure which Germany will dominate as the largest and strongest economy. That is where the furore over the decision to recognise Croatia begins to ring alarm bells. A European Union dominated by Germany may be a good place to spend the third millenium. But old enmities could re-emerge with the 'uppity' Germans challenged by equally uppity French or Italians. How can such conflicts be resolved if sovereignty has been ceded to an institution dominated by one power? Ridley attracted ridicule for his view that a more unified Europe would make it harder to preserve a balance between the main continental powers - the traditional aim of UK foreign policy. For his pains, he was accused of being a little Englander, dwelling in an imperial past and unable to come to terms with the new Europe. Yet I find myself increasingly in tune with his argument, in spite of a fondness for things German.</p>

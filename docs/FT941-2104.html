			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Survey of Jersey (11): A chance to hop on the fast track and Victor Matthews - Those lured over the years include John Nettles (star of the Bergerac TV series), Ian Woosnam, Alan Whicker / Residency Wanted: a handful of prominent individuals to move to Jersey each year to help swell tax revenues and contribute to the community. Apply with detailed CV and expect a rigorous interview. Those with a criminal record, or who are not famous or have assets below Pounds 10m need not bother to apply. For the lucky few with honestly-earned fame or fortune behind them, Jersey offers a chance to hop on the fast track and circumvent its ferocious residency regulations to gain access to life in a low tax haven. Residency control was introduced in 1970, with locals classified in categories A to H, and outsiders granted permission to live locally on economic or social grounds as category K. This entitles them to buy or rent high-priced accommodation that has been classified for K residents. Those lured over the years include Harry Patterson (better known as author Jack Higgins), John Nettles (star of the TV detective series Bergerac which is based in Jersey), Alan Whicker, Ian Woosnam, and Victor Matthews. Many more residents have unfamiliar names, choosing a lower profile, and having always concentrated on making money more than garnering public attention. 'I've seen some serious City figures in my office,' says Mr Roger Trower, head of Broadlands, probably the largest firm of estate agents on the island. He says that among Jersey's attractions for them are the island's closeness to the UK, the low tax rates, the stable economy and the fact that English is spoken. He adds that the island is very safe for children, with good sporting facilities and milder weather than on the UK mainland. France is only 15 minutes away by aircraft. 'I could make a call and be on a golf course there this afternoon,' he says. 'It's genuinely a nice place to live.' One of the people most influential in making the decision for residency is Mr Colin Powell, chief adviser to the States of Jersey. He or his deputy interviews every applicant to gain information on their background, motives and what they are likely to contribute to the island - such as their time, charitable donations and sponsorship of events, as well as tax. Mr Powell inspects financial information to ensure that their money is honestly obtained and to verify their assets. He then makes a recommendation  -without revealing any of these personal details - to the housing committee, which formally makes the decision. 'This can give the impression that there is almost a price to come in,' he says. 'But some form of selection has to be employed. This was felt to be the best system. The island has a problem of limited space and a concern about population growth.' Mr Powell will not be drawn on naming those who have been turned down, but he says the number is not that large because most who apply have already been screened by professionals from the accountancy and law firms who know the criteria required and who advise those not suitable against going through the process. Since the early 1970s, Jersey had been allowing in about 15 K-category residents each year. This was reduced to five during more recent times of strong economic growth, but has now been increased again so that about 10 people can expect residence annually. There are several other ways to qualify to live on the island. Those who are born there naturally have rights of residency, as do those who marry locals. However, Jersey passport-holders must be able to show that they, both their parents and all grandparents were born locally. On the other hand, those with Channel Islands passports are at a disadvantage compared with the UK, because they do not share the right of all European Union citizens to work in any country within the union. Jersey also allows in each year about 30-40 people in the J category - or 'essential employees' - those who are considered necessary for a company's successful operations. Employers have to satisfy the housing committee that anyone granted this status could not be found from among local residents. Essential employees are allowed to stay for five years, after which they have traditionally been expected to leave. Last year, the housing committee relaxed the requirements so that employers can petition for additional extensions up to 10 years, at which point they can become long-term residents. Other Europeans can enter Jersey to find work. The problem is finding accommodation. They are forbidden from living in any of the accommodation available for residents in categories A to K. Instead, they must spend their time in lodgings: either specially-designated apartment blocks supervised by the housing committee, or in rooms in other people's houses. In the past, their status never changed. However, last year the politicians agreed a modest relaxation: those who have lived in Jersey for 20 years or more would be able to settle and buy accommodation as though they were long-term residents.</p>

			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN LEFT;  </P> <P> THE WAR OVER WHO KEEPS THE LOOT;  </P> <P> THIS NATION ISN'T BROKE; BUSH JUST WANTS THE MONEY TO STAY IN PRIVATE HANDS.  </P> <P> Saying that the United States is a rich country is like saying that Iceland is  a cold one. But that statement made news down here in south Florida's gleaming  montage of speedboats, speedy cars, glass towers, glossy people, and half the  treasure, legal and illegal, of countries from Guatemala to Argentina.  </P> <P> The headlines were made by a Brookings Institution report restating the  obvious: The U.S. economy is almost three times as big as any other in the  world, and it is still growing and growing.  </P> <P> The report, calling for the universal solution of "more leadership," is really  a book-length attack on what appears to be some of George Bush's zanier  points-of-light thinking. The President likes to deflect calls for action or  leadership by pleading national poverty. The United States, says our only  President, has "more will than wallet."  </P> <P> Ridiculous, says Brookings, with righteous and accurate indignation. The  report, called "Setting National Priorities," concludes: "The question is not  whether America has enough wallet, but whether it has the will to use its  abundant wealth to solve the problems it faces."  </P> <P> But Bush the bad-mouther is not zany at all. He's protecting the traditional  power of rich people who control American culture and charity. What Bush is  trying to create, with some success, is perceptions of public poverty. That, he  and many other conservatives reckon, creates or adds to private wealth --  particularly for those whose wallets bulge with revenues from capital gains and  trust funds. The "investing class" is Bush's core constituency.  </P> <P> Squinting through the day's news in Florida sunshine, you can see the  skirmishes in the internal war over the distribution of growing wealth. In the  Sun-Sentinel in Fort Lauderdale, there is a photograph of some of the 2,000  teachers and school officials demonstrating at the state capitol to protest a  $300-million shortfall (their estimate) in funding to educate the 100,000 new  students expected to enter Florida schools next year.  </P> <P> The minority leader of the state's House of Representatives, Dale Patchett, a  Vero Beach Republican, was quoted in the Miami Herald, in response to calls for  spending, as saying that there is no money. The only thing left to be taxed in  Florida, he said, is "the time of day."  </P> <P> Good line. But among the things the state of Florida does not tax is income.  </P> <P> Bush's fundamental argument -- and Patchett's, too -- is that the power of  America's fantastic wealth is better kept in the hands of the people than of  the government. That's a pretty good argument, but it would be better if he was  talking about all the people. In practice, most of that wealth and power --  like the revenue that would be raised by progressive income taxes -- is being  transferred from the middle class to the trust-fund rich.  </P> <P> Another item in the news last week shows how it works. The Bass Foundation and  the Philecology Trust contributed $20 million to establish an Institute of  Biospheric Studies at Yale. Edward Bass, whose uncle was a fabulously  successful oil man, is a 44-year-old Yale graduate who worries about the  ecosphere and has used the power of his money to determine what research and  study should be done at one of the country's great institutions.  </P> <P> Trusts and foundations -- basically ways to avoid income and inheritance taxes  under American law -- give the rich control over the great range of American  institutions between government and commerce. A few rich people exercise  enormous power over universities and hospitals, theaters and symphony halls and  museums -- whatever interests them. Bass happens to be interested in  biospherics -- so Yale is, too. If he were interested in philately, Yale would  be collecting stamps.  </P> <P> On balance over the years, such philanthropists have probably done a great deal  more good than harm. But they did it their way. Other Americans need not apply  when it comes to institutionalizing much of art and science in this great and  wealthy and productive democracy.  </P> <P> George Bush, as President, is a diligent protector and proponent of his own  kind. He is pretending that America is a poor country to protect the privileges  and power of the better people -- at least the ones with the better wallets.  </P></p>

			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / International Company News: Seven Network leaves TV group Seven Network, one of Australia's smaller commercial TV networks, is to withdraw from the Optus Vision consortium, formed a few months ago to build a national cable network across Australia. Seven's involvement in the consortium - which includes Mr Kerry Packer's Publishing &amp; Broadcasting group and Optus, the telecommunications carrier - was controversial, given that 15 per cent of Seven's shares are held by Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, and another 10 per cent by the government-owned Telecom group. News and Telecom have formed a consortium to build a rival national cable/pay-TV network. Seven said its withdrawal was prompted by the federal government's stance over the regulatory framework for broadband networks, announced last month. Seven said it considered the new rules had 'marginalised the Optus Vision business opportunity'. Some commentators suspect that Seven's withdrawal heralds the collapse of the Optus Vision consortium. Its future was thrown into doubt when Mr Michael Lee, the federal minister for communications, said he would not allow monopolies in cable infrastructure and would not act to stop geographical duplication of the networks planned by Optus Vision and Telstra. P&amp;B has withdrawn from a potential ADollars 318m (USDollars 246m) investment in Optus as a result. Australis Media, the fledgling company which has promised to provide Australia's first pay-TV service at the beginning of 1995, said it planned to raise about USDollars 200m through an issue of senior discount notes in the US. Merrill Lynch has been retained to handle the public offering, which is expected to take place in the new year. Australis said the proceeds would be used to fund a portion of the costs of rolling out subscription broadcast TV services.</p>

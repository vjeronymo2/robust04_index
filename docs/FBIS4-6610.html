			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Shinseito leader Tsutomu Hata at a joint news </F> conference with unidentified correspondents at the Diet building  in Tokyo -- live]    [Text] [Hata] This is Tsutomu Hata. As has just been  announced by the coalition leaders, I have been selected from  among the coalition party leaders, including Social Democratic  Party of Japan [SDPJ] Chairman Tomiichi Murayama, as a candidate  to be the new prime minister of the coalition's second  administration.    Frankly speaking, I do not think I am a capable man, and  cannot help feeling some hesitation in accepting the serious  responsibilities over state affairs. However, since the  coalition leaders have been trying so hard to reach a  conclusion, I have to take upon myself the hair-raising  responsibilities as top leader of the nation. Thus, I have  decided to accept the candidacy.    As Murayama just noted, the coalition has worked out a  multiparty memorandum on a policy accord for forming a new  coalition government. When I am approved as the new prime  minister through Diet elections, I will try my best, in line  with the policy accord, to make Japan a sound nation where  everybody can live in comfort. Also, I will seek the  high-quality nation advocated by Hosokawa.    Another point is that, as other coalition leaders have  stated, Japan must become a trustworthy, understandable, and  beloved nation in the international community. I would like to  try my best to achieve these objectives.    I sincerely seek the understanding of the public. Thank you  very much.</p>

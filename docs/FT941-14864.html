			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / International Company News: Investcorp posts profits up 7% Investcorp, the Bahrain-based international merchant bank, which last year took over Gucci, the luxury goods company, yesterday announced a 7.3 per cent increase in full-year post-tax profits to Dollars 67.3m, after making six acquisitions during 1993. Investcorp was established 11 years ago by 335 founding shareholders from Arab countries. It was intended as a vehicle to channel private wealth from the region into established businesses in developed countries. The bank continued its tradition of making an annual cash dividend payment of Pounds 15m to shareholders. This has been held constant since its foundation at 15 per cent of the Dollars 100m capital paid in by founding shareholders. Among the bank's deals in the US during the year were the acquisition of Camelot Music, for which it is thought to have paid more than Dollars 350m, and Circle K, the fourth-largest chain of convenience stores. In Europe, it arranged the acquisition of Thorn Lighting from Thorn EMI for Pounds 162m (Dollars 239.8m). It also paid Dollars 170m to raise its stake and those of its clients in Gucci from 50 per cent to complete ownership. Mr Elia Hallack, co-chief operating officer, said that the bank's capital investment activities had an exceptional year because two of six large deals had been started in 1992. But he believed there was strong potential this year. He said that trading activities had been 'disappointing'. However, the bank intended to continue developing them.</p>

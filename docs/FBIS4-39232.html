			<p>BFN     [Text] The head of the Russian presidential administration  Sergey Filatov has accused the Chechen President Dzhokar Dudayev  of foiling the talks between Moscow and Groznyy. In a Monday  interview with Interfax he said that the latest statement by  Dudayev actually undermined the budding talks between Chechnya  and the federal government bodies.    On Sunday in an interview televised by NTV, Dudayev, who  seemed very irritated, once again accused Russia of fanning  tension around his republic and threatened to apply adequate  measures to Russia.    At a meeting with the press, Filatov said it was most  strange  that Groznyy actually refuses to continue the dialogue because  he claimed it was the Chechen leadership that came with the  initiative of the meeting between presidents Boris Yeltsin and  Dzhokar Dudayev.    Filatov regretted that instead of a policy of negotiations  Dudayev chose the policy of seeking enemies.    He described as a dirty game the attempt of the Chechen  leader to label the decree of the Russian president on the  expansion of the zone of the state of emergency in North Ossetia  and Ingushetia as the occupation of Chechen territory by Russia.  He said the spreading of the state of emergency regulations to  Malgobek and Sunzhen regions of Ingushetia neighboring on  Chechnya was agreed upon by Yeltsin and the Ingush President  Ruslan Aushev and directed at strengthening stability and peace  in the region.    Filatov recognized that Dudayev is the actual Chechen leader  who cannot be disregarded but said that a threat to Russian  society comes from that area. He said arms are smuggled from  Chechnya to Russia, trains are robbed, other crimes committed.    "In any case Russia has two problems to resolve in Chechnya:  socio-economic and fiscal, it has to protect Russian citizens  there", Filatov said. He stressed that if passengers and cargos  crossing Chechnya by rail are not protected, Russia might face  the necessity of altering the railway route.    Filatov said that despite the failure of the talks with  Groznyy Moscow will try to analyze the reasons and define the  way of normalizing relations.    The sharp anti-Russian statements on the part of Chechen  President Dzhokar Dudayev make it impossible that Moscow appoint  representatives for the talks on settlement of relations between  the Russian federal bodies and Groznyy, Kremlin Chief of Staff  Sergey Filatov told Interfax today. He stressed that the  president had earlier wanted new Minister for Nationalities and  Regional Policies Nikolay Yegorov to be the Russian chief  negotiator at the talks with Chechnya.</p>

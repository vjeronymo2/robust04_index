			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Survey on A-Z of Computing (16): The global village gains momentum - Open Systems THERE IS no such thing as a truly open system. Not yet. An open system should run across and with any other hardware and software. Even given the necessary technology, it would take several purchasing cycles before the world found itself using the same standard. In so far as an open system exists, the MS/DOS software standard can claim to be a world leader. But MS/DOS rode to fame on the back of the IBM PC. And IBM yields to open systems only when change becomes inevitable. Openness used to be in the eye of the vendor. But users discovered that banding together and demanding the right to switch hardware platforms produced results. Gradually, the big suppliers were dragged, kicking and screaming, into agreed standards. For the computer industry shifted towards compatibility reluctantly and has been looking for ways to recoup lost profit margins ever since. The Unix operating system, once derided as non-commercial, is a good example of big operators rewriting history. Unix emerged from AT&amp;T's Bell Laboratories, and as such was unlikely to find favour with AT&amp;T's arch corporate rival, IBM. For years Unix struggled against the stigma of beards and sandals - a fine operating system for techno-hippies on the West Coast, but not one you'd want to introduce to the company computer. Gradually it was rewritten to include user-friendly and practical features. Smaller suppliers adopted it while pressure groups grew up demanding bridges to Unix. Large manufacturers were reluctant to promote an operating system whose prime virtue was that it could run across different hardware architectures, provided those architectures were tweaked to accommodate it. Championed by a variety of interest groups, Unix stormed the bastion of IBM. It made its first appearance under the guise of AIX. IBM sells plenty of other people's products and ideas, but never loses an opportunity to stick a 'Big Blue' badge on them. Endorsement by IBM might have been the end of the story. But the Unix world contained too many conflicting forces. Unix International was backed by AT&amp;T and sworn to bringing vendors into line with Unix. The Open Systems Foundation (OSF) promoted the IBM/Digital Equipment line. The users stood back and remained suspicious of any tack taken by vendors. Enter X/Open - an open standards promotion body claiming to rise above vendor politicking. These organisations have advanced the cause of open systems, although every step forward seems to be accompanied by guerrilla warfare. 'Our mission in life is to expand the market in open systems' declared an X/Open spokesman. The idea is to get independent specifications verified. A recent example is the veteran ICL operating system VME. ICL took this well-established chunk of software and added a layer of code that opened it up to the X/Open standards. With a large user base and a recognised pedigree, VME's conversion shows that open systems are a reality and X/Open is a serious force. While older systems catch up with common standards, new technologies emerge. The information technology industry now incorporates open systems into innovations, but users continue to band together. Old suspicions die hard. The next generation of business computers will make imaginative use of graphics and video images. Advanced Risc Computer Specification (Arcs) machines are being developed by a consortium of hardware and software concerns. This co-operation is vital to ensure true compatibility. It also recognises the power of user opinion. Whatever assurances were given about common interfaces, Arcs technology would face a rough ride if purchasers feared future compatibility headaches. Arcs and its accompanying software will pull in other business equipment such as fax machines. Bill Gates, chairman of software giant Microsoft, says he is in talks with office equipment manufacturers to create gateways to fax and photocopier machines. The next generation of office computer will incorporate a broader concept of open systems, embracing what are currently stand-alone technologies. There is a contradiction between open systems and technological progress. Freeze the development of computer systems, let users and suppliers spend a decade sorting out connections, and the open systems globe would be a lot closer. Nobody has suggested such a move, least of all users who keep discovering new requirements to be featured in next year's product. The real achievement of the open systems movement is that its ideas have become accepted in the same way as mainstream political parties now accept the European Community. Like the EC, open systems is not meant to be a utopia, just a means to a more practical world.</p>

			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / International Company News: McDonnell Douglas to axe 5,000 THE TRANSPORT aircraft arm of McDonnell Douglas, the defence and aerospace group, is to cut its workforce by up to 5,000 people or about 16 per cent, this year largely because of declining new jetliner orders. About half of the latest layoffs will come from workers indirectly involved in producing aircraft. The rest will come from employees directly involved in production. Douglas Aircraft, which employees about 36,000 people, has already slashed 17,000 indirect jobs since April 1990 with about 7,000 from normal attrition. The company said the latest cuts were part of its new 'zero-based' budgeting effort, which involves keeping only those positions essential to making aircraft. In a letter to employees, Mr Robert Hood, president of Douglas Aircraft said one of the most immediate challenges to the company 'is to lower expenses to be better aligned with the expected lower revenues which are the result of the prolonged slump in the airline industry. This means we must reduce the number of people in addition to cutting other expenses.' There has been widespread speculation that a project to build a MD-12 super-jumbo jet in partnership withTaiwan Aerospace has been foundering. Mr Hood said talks with Taiwan have slowed but the company is continuing to make progress in talks with other potential partners. 'I remain personally convinced we will successfully negotiate a mutually satisfactory agreement with investors in Taiwan.' In a separate announcement, the company said it will lay off about 100 employees at its electronic systems operations.</p>

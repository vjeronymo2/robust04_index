			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Jim Cheung, and M.Y. Sung in Beijing] </F>   [Text] A senior government official has said that he saw  no evidence of a thaw in Sino-British relations when he met  senior officials in charge of Hong Kong affairs in Beijing this  week, despite recent declarations by China that its political  row with Britain would not thwart cooperation. Secretary for  Trade and Industry Brian Chau was in Beijing on official  business, when Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and director  of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office Lu Ping, declared that  two of the biggest obstacles to Sino-British cooperation could  quickly be resolved.    During his trip, Mr Chau met the affair's office Deputy  Director Chen Ziying and department head Wang Fengchao. Mr Chau  said while his contact with both officials was brief and  friendly, their position had not changed since the political row  first began. "Their attitude towards me was the same when I last  saw them two years ago," he said.    In Beijing, the Foreign Ministry continued to speak of  conciliation, but stressed that continuing cooperation depended  on Britain's attitude. "The Chinese side hopes that  difficulties over the question of Hong Kong will not affect ties  between the two countries in other areas," Foreign Ministry  spokesman Shen Guofang said. "The Chinese side is willing to  have further cooperation with the British side. But whether it  can be done depends on what approach and action the British side  takes."    The chairman of the Federation of Trade Unions Cheng  Yiu-tong, who led a delegation to Beijing this week, said he was  convinced that China was determined to shelve the long-running  political row and resume cooperation with Britain. "Mr Qian  emphasised that the deadlock over 1994-95 electoral reform was  over," Mr Cheng said. "He said that China would strengthen  economic cooperation with Britain to ensure a smooth transition  in the remaining years."</p>

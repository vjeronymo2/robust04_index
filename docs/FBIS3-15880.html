			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Some media, with reference to the opinion of foreign  observers, reported that the election held in Kazakhstan was not  democratic. Our correspondent met Talgatbek Abaidildin, a  member of the Central Election Commission, and asked him to  clarify this information. This is what he said:    [Begin Abaidildin recording] In our republic there were  10,224 polling stations. Foreign observers visited about 30 of  them, mainly in the city of Almaty, the town of Kapchagay  [Almaty Oblast]. In my opinion, it is at least unethical on the  part of observers to draw conclusions that the election in the  republic of Kazakhstan was not democratic. When we spoke to the  journalists, their group did not have unanimous opinions. For  instance, I can show written references from other observers  that testify to the opposite. They say that the election in  Kazakhstan was democratic. Yes, we did have some facts of  negligence, even transgression at some polling stations.  Currently the Central Election Commission is taking measures.  If the [election] code has been violated, we might hold results  obtained at these stations as invalid. Our foreign observers,  on the whole, expressed their gratitude to the president of the  republic and to the Foreign Ministry, as well as to the Central  Election Commission for this invitation and for the official  possibility given to them. We are not hiding anything from  them. This attitude disarmed them. When coming here, they  thought that Kazakhstan's sovereignty is very new, this is the  first ever election code and there might be many discrepancies.  I might be mistaken but they certainly had some prejudices.  But they saw for themselves that we are open, we speak openly  at all levels, literally. This has disarmed them. Yesterday  evening we talked to the head of the CSCE group and he said that  they would pass on to us some of their wishes, but in general  they are satisfied with their visits to the polling stations and  the procedural side of the election. But [word indistinct] it  turned out to be different. I do not think there were any  serious transgressions or any remarks about serious mistakes  made. But in any case we will work on these remarks in order to  avoid such mistakes in future. [end recording]</p>

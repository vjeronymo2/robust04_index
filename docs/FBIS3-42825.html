			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Remarks by Emil Pain, Presidential Council member, recorded </F> by Mari Silven: "'The Political Climate Is Manifestly  Inauspicious...'"]    [Text] "The atmosphere for the visit is quite strange, and  it is hard for me to select an analogy even. Yeltsin is going to  a country whose public opinion considers Russia to blame for its  biggest national defeat," Emil Pain, member of the Presidential  Council, told your OBSHCHAYA GAZETA correspondent on the eve of  the visit. "The psychological atmosphere in Georgian society is  anti-Russian Federation and anti-Russian. All parties have  decisively protested Russia's policy. Were Russian-Georgian  relations already 'full' interstate relations, the president  would hardly be going to a country whose political climate is so  manifestly inauspicious for an official visit. There is a great  danger that there will be in such a situation, instead of  interstate negotiations, simply a meeting of two people.    "There were for a long time many inhibitory factors, and the  date of the visit had been postponed several times. It was  primarily the state of war with Abkhazia which was getting in  the way. Politically, the problem has yet to be resolved, but  the hostilities have ceased, and this creates the minimum  prerequisites for the visit. The second aspect is the position  of the North Caucasus republics opposed to a rapprochement of  Russia and Georgia. Since the October events relations between  the president and the republics have changed quite radically  compared with what they were like under the conditions of  diarchy, which made the trip to Tbilisi possible. I assume that  the Russian-American summit also exerted an influence to some  extent. America is very concerned by Russia's position in  relation to Georgia, and the question of a reconciliation and of  Russia's more benevolent attitude toward Georgia was, evidently,  studied during the preparation for Clinton's visit and during  his time in Moscow. Georgia had been seeking the conclusion of a  treaty with Russia throughout the past year. Tbilisi had an  interest primarily in the regulation and establishment of the  borders of the Georgian state and recognition of its integrity.  The signing of such a treaty would signify that  Russia--officially, at least--is not an ally of Abkhazia. Hopes  for some economic assistance are also linked with the treaty  for, after all, the population of Georgia is receiving a  blockade bread ration.    Russia's first geopolitical interest in such a treaty  consists of the firmness of its borders. It is not at all a  matter of indifference to us whom Chechnya borders and how  friendly toward us the regime of the neighboring country is. The  second: Russia aspires to support democratic regimes, and any  subsequent regime in Georgia will be, from Russia's viewpoint,  worse for it than the present one. And the third: a general  regulation of mutual relations in the post-Soviet world.</p>

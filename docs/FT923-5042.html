			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Insurance solvency formula 'absurd' INSURANCE industry regulators were criticised yesterday over alleged inadequacies in the way they assess the solvency of general insurance companies. Mr Andrew Paddick, director-general of the Institute of Insurance Brokers, said the formula used by the Department of Trade and Industry to assess solvency - net assets as a percentage of non-life premium income - was 'totally absurd'. The institute, a trade association, was particularly concerned in view of the deteriorating financial health of many UK insurers. Mr Paddick explained that increased competition in the industry had rendered the solvency ratio an increasingly inadequate guide to the ability of insurance companies to meet claims. Insurers could trigger falls in their solvency if they increased premiums while, ironically, cutting premiums to uneconomic levels would be rewarded with an increase in the solvency margin. 'Years ago, when tariffs kept rates stable and risks were properly evaluated, it may have made some sense to use such a formula,' he said. One small insurance company, which became insolvent earlier this year, had a solvency margin of 71.4 per cent at the end of 1990. Mr Paddick said that was more than four times the legal minimum. He said brokers and other insurance buyers needed more detailed information to assess the viability of companies with which they placed business. Mr Denzil Curgenven, of Quest Insurance Research, a market research organisation, said other factors were as important a guide to a company's economic well-being as the solvency ratio. These included the strength of the company's financial base, the details of its reinsurance arrangements, the type of insurance it underwrote and the size of its management expenses. A new research service, published by the institute and Quest, provides analysis on 70 UK insurance companies. Mr Curgenven said: 'You can't judge a company on one factor, certainly not in today's market. The fortunes of UK insurers have changed with bewildering speed.' Lancashire police yesterday made 16 arrests in connection with an alleged fraud at the Preston offices of General Accident, the country's third largest insurer. The arrests were made after raids on 13 homes in north-west England. General Accident confirmed that a member of its staff was among those arrested. Police said that the alleged fraud involved false claims worth several hundred thousands of pounds on 'third party' insurance policies which had been made over a number of years.</p>

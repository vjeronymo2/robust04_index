This is the unchanged position of  the Israeli entity's officials. What we find peculiar is that  this demand is made on the eve of the U.S.-Syrian summit and at  a time of preparations for further negotiations, particularly on  the Lebanese and Syrian tracks.    Deputy Sadqi warned Lebanese officials against falling into  the traps set up by the Israeli enemy, and he called on them to  stand firmly by our legitimate and just rights. He called on  Lebanese officials not only to insist on Israel's withdrawal  from all Lebanese territories but also to hand back all the  Lebanese land and water resources that it has usurped. He  pointed out that Israel has confiscated 13 farms constituting  all the agricultural land of Shib'a.</p>

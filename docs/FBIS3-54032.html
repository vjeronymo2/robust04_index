He pointed out that there were some powers which did not  approve of the stability of Sudan and which strove to disrupt  its relations with its neighbors. He said this yesterday when  he met a Chinese media delegation.    The foreign minister pointed out the presence of foreign  interference, which sought to disrupt good relations with  fraternal Eritrea. He stressed that there was a need to be wary  of such plots.    During the meeting, Dr. Abu-Salih reviewed Sudan's efforts  to  achieve an Arab accord. His excellency appealed to African  countries to rely on themselves to develop their own  capabilities. He pointed out that the stands of western  countries against Sudan came about because of Sudan's  independent decision-making.

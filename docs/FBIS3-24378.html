			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article, under the rubric "Statistics," in two installments </F> by Nikolay Kivchun, director of the RF State Statistics  Committee Sakhalin Educational Center: "What Is Happening in the  Field of Industry"]  <H5>  [12 Feb p 4] </H5>   [Text] As analysis of statistical data shows, the situation  in Sakhalin Oblast may be characterized as extremely serious. In  order to show this clearly, I will cite data for 1993 from the  oblast statistical administration.    Thus, according to the data, on 1 January 1994 there were  8,792 economic subjects registered on the territory of Sakhalin  Oblast.    There were 565 commercial organizations, including state  enterprises; 128 municipal organizations; 1,689 individual  organizations (family and private); 269 open-type joint stock  companies; 3,119 closed-type joint stock companies and limited  partnerships; 1,033 peasant and private farms; and 299  production cooperatives.    Among noncommercial organizations, there were 526 state  institutions and 93 public associations.    It is obvious from the figures cited that the oblast's  economy has fundamentally changed; it has become a market  economy. Whereas before the reforms, there used to be three  forms of ownership--state, kolkhoz-cooperative, and personal,  now different organizational forms and enterprises have  appeared, and in choosing any one of them, they become free and  independent. That is exactly what is required for a market.    In 1993 Sakhalin's industrial enterprises in current prices  produced 521 billion rubles [R] worth of output (and jobs and  services); that includes R70.4 billion worth in December, which  is 6.8 times the same indicators for 1992.    The volume of production (in constant prices) declined by  13.8 percent as compared with last year and by 22.2 percent in  December.    In the processing industry, this indicator declined by 18.1  percent, while in the chemical, petrochemical, and light  industries, the figure reached 13-43 percent. In electrical  power engineering and the petroleum production and coal sectors,  the decline in production volumes was 11-17 percent, while for  extraction industry as a whole the figure was 6 percent.    Thus, an increase in production can be shown only in  monetary  terms. The real volume of production declined and the decline  has not stopped.    The process of destatization of enterprises continued in  industry throughout 1993. As of 1 October 1993, more than half  of the industrial enterprises producing more than 60 percent of  the output were found in the private and mixed forms of  ownership.    Nonstate forms of ownership were most common in sectors such  as the building materials, light, and food industries.    Losses of work time increased; that is above all related to  the lengthy shutdowns of enterprises and production facilities.  The greatest losses of work time were typical for enterprises of  the timber, wood-processing and pulp and paper, light, and food  industries--96.5 percent of the overall losses. More than half  of the enterprise shutdowns in December were related to  difficulties in the marketing of output as well as the  unavailability of material resources.    Of the 125 types of industrial output, the production  volumes  for 70 of them declined by 15 percent or more. A significant  decline occurred in the food and fish (67 percent), light (10),  and timber, wood-processing, and paper and pulp (8.6 percent)  industries.    A higher volume of production during 1993 was observed for  26  types of output. They included cement, wallpaper, certain types  of furniture, frozen and salted fish, and frozen fillets.    In the fuel and energy sectors, in December 1993 an increase  in extraction (production) was noted for the basic types of  energy resources; this is typical for the fall-winter period .  Thus, in January-December, 2.607 billion kilowatt hours of  electricity were produced (96.1 percent of last year's level);  3.667 million gigacalories of thermal power (98.2 percent);  1.6186 billion cubic meters of natural gas; 1.5609 million  tonnes of oil, including gas concentrate; and 4.23 million  tonnes of coal.    In 1993 as a whole as compared to the previous year, the  production of oil, including gas concentrate, declined by 6.9  percent (by 9.1 percent in 1992); of gas--by 6.4 percent (as  opposed to 8.4 percent in 1992); and of coal--by 6.2 percent (as  compared to a 3.5 percent increase in 1992). Converted to  standard units, the extraction and production of all types of  energy resources declined by 5.9 percent (by 3.7 percent in  1992).  <H5>  [19 Feb p 4] </H5>   [Text] Logging sector enterprises reduced the production of  commercial timber by 569.2 million cubic meters in 1993; that  led to a 29-60 percent decline in production of railroad  crossties and timbers and a 92 percent decline in production of  factory-built wooden buildings.    In the last months of last year, the production of commodity  cellulose declined sharply--in all only 14,900 tonnes were  produced, and that is 71.2 percent less than in 1992. A bad  situation took shape in production of cardboard also; produced  in December were 260 tonnes, or 11.4 percent of the level of  that month in 1992.    In 1993 light industry enterprises produced 12,300 knitted  items (92.3 percent) and 216,000 pairs of leather shoes (85.7  percent).    As compared with the previous year, production of shoes  declined by 14.3 percent; of knitted items--by 7.7 percent; and  of garments such as raincoats and rainjackets, jackets, suits,  shirts, and other things--by 26-65 percent.    One of the main reasons for the decline in the volume of  production in this sector is the shortage of inhouse working  capital resulting from difficulties in marketing output and the  failure of customers to pay; their indebtedness as of 1 December  1993 totaled R810 million.    Food industry enterprises produced the following: 6,825  tonnes of meat, including byproducts; 28,143 tonnes of whole  milk products; 4,595 tonnes of sausage products; and 63,768  tonnes of bread and bakery goods. The decline in production of  the products listed above was 16-43 percent. Moreover, changes  occurred in the structure of the food industry in favor of  higher priced types: thus, production of smoked items increased  by 5 percent, while production of thoroughly smoked sausage  items increased by a factor of 1.8.    The fish catch declined by 12 percent as compared to last  year's level, and that in turn entailed reduced production of  fish products both overall and for certain variety groups. In  particular specially dressed fish declined by 55.2 percent and  culinary items declined by more than half.    In only three rayons, Kholmskiy, Kurilskiy, and  Smirnykhovskiy, was the volume of industrial production above  the 1992 level. The oblast's other rayons reduced production of  output, and in eight rayons the drop was as much as 30-60  percent.  <H5>  Labor Payment and the Number of Workers in Industry </H5>   The number of people working in industry totaled 88,375 and  declined by 8.1 percent as compared to the same period last year.    The average wages in November 1993 rose by a factor of 11.9  as compared with the corresponding period last year.    The wages of power engineering workers were 56 percent  higher  than the average in industry; of coal miners--44 percent higher;  and of dairy industry workers--50 percent higher.    The number of people working in enterprises with the state  form of ownership as of 1 October 1993 was 36,150, or 40 percent  of people working, and their average wages in September were  R161,232.    There were 200 people (0.2 percent) working at enterprises  with the municipal form of ownership with average wages of  R45,388.    There are 46,943 people, or 54 percent of all people working  in the oblast's industry, laboring in open-type joint stock  companies with a mixed form of ownership where the average wages  in September were R165,076.    The number of people working during the first 9 months in  closed-type joint stock companies with the private form of  ownership was 2,632 (3 percent), while the average wages in  September were R160,139.    An extremely serious, one might say disastrous, situation  took shape in the oblast's economy in January 1994. The decline  in production totaled 34.2 percent, while wholesale prices rose  by 30.5 percent as compared with December 1993 and 10-fold as  compared with January 1993.    There were 22 enterprises of the timber, wood-processing,  pulp and paper, and food industries standing idle in Sakhalin in  January; as a result 18,200 worker-days of work time were lost.    Just what are the reasons for this situation?    In my opinion, the main reason is that the proportions in  the  economy have been disrupted. While changing to the market, we  have arrived at anarchy and completely discontinued planning and  forecasting economic development. Even though it is well known  that in countries where market relations have existed for  decades, the state does not stop regulating them.    A second, quite important reason for the situation which has  taken shape is that there is no stable, scientifically  substantiated legislation. Thousands of edicts and decrees which  contradict one another and do not comply with the Constitution  are issued.    The next trouble is the present tax system. If it is not  refined, the producer will have no incentive to produce output  and, consequently, there will be no market.    At this time, most of the goods coming to the oblast are  imported. We export raw materials and create jobs for Japanese,  South Koreans, and Americans and expect finished output from  them. But just what are we ourselves supposed to do?    And, finally, one of the extremely important reasons for the  bad situation in the sphere of economics is the psychology of  our people, who for 70 years were taught not to believe in  private property, initiative, and entrepreneurship. And now we  find ourselves in the position of people who have been cast into  the sea without bothering to find out if we know how to swim or  not.    Of course, time is needed for people to learn how to live  and  work in market conditions. And during this transitional period  all the problems which are arising must be regulated at the  state level; otherwise the country will be completely dependent  on foreign capital and lose any kind of independence.</p>

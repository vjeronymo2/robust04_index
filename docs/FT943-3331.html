			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Lac loses fight for zinc-lead venture A court battle between three big mining companies for control of the Lisheen project in County Tipperary, Ireland, the second-largest zinc-lead deposit in Europe, ended yesterday with defeat for the Canadian group Lac Minerals. This leaves the way clear for Ivernia West, a 'junior' Irish exploration company, to take control of the project. Ivernia's two biggest shareholders, each with 24.5 per cent, are Minorco, the offshore arm of the Anglo American-De Beers group of South Africa, and Outokumpu, the state-owned Finnish group. Mr David Hough, Ivernia's managing director, said last night that he hoped his company could now turn away from the courts and concentrate on getting a mine into operation. It might be possible to start production towards the end of 1997, eventually achieving an annual output of about 200,000 tonnes of zinc and 30,000 tonnes of lead in concentrate. The dispute arose because Chevron, like many other international oil companies, is divesting itself of its mining interests and wants to dispose of its stake in the Lisheen venture. It agreed in September 1992 to sell to Lac, one of Canada's biggest gold producers, which also had ambitions to become established in base metals mining. But Ivernia West, which owns the minority interest in Lisheen, claimed to have pre-emptive rights over Chevron's 52.5 per cent. This claim was tested in the Irish High Court and Lac said yesterday that the court had ruled against it and said that Ivernia West did have pre-emptive rights. Lac said it would study the High Court judgment before deciding on any further action. An appeal is possibile, but Lac was recently taken over by American Barrick Resources, North America's biggest gold producer, and analysts said Barrick was unlikely to be interested in pursuing a zinc-lead venture. Minorco some time ago agreed to provide Ivernia with Dollars 72m (Pounds 46.4m) to buy Chevron's share of Lisheen and for Ivernia to sell 50 per cent of the ore body to Minorco in return for cancellation of the loan.  ----------------------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Monday's close) tonnes  ----------------------------------------------------- Aluminium            -11,800  to  2,401,550 Aluminium alloy          +40  to  25,760 Copper                  +675  to  370,075 Lead                  +3,400  to  368,175 Nickel                  +750  to  141,618 Zinc                     -50  to  1,236,900 Tin                      -35  to  31,880  -----------------------------------------------------</p>

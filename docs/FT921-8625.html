			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Construction Contracts: Hong Kong Airport development project Hong Kong's Provisional Airport Authority (PAA) has awarded INGERSOLL-RAND an order for six large DM-M2 drilling rigs with a list value of around USDollars 5m (Pounds 2.8m) to be used in the site formation contract for the Chek Lap Kok Airport. The drills will produce holes for blasting rock from Chep Lap Kok itself to form most of the foundation for the new airport. Excavation of 90m cu metres of rock and weathered derivatives will be required, nearly one and a half times the UK's annual crushed rock production. The purchase of equipment for the site information project will aid bidding for the 30-month contract.</p>

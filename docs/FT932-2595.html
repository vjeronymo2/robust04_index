			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Delors on sick leave MR Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, is on extended leave after suffering an attack of sciatica, but is still expected to attend next Monday's EC summit in Copenhagen, writes Lionel Barber in Brussels. Mr Delors cancelled a pre-summit news conference scheduled for today in Brussels, his fourth day off work. But aides said he was working at home and quashed rumours that he might be too sick to deliver a presentation on Europe's unemployment crisis in Copenhagen.</p>

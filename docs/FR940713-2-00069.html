Paragraph I.(c)(1)(ii) of the NOFA, under the heading  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> Employment of Housing Authority Police <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> , which listed housing authorities eligible to apply because they have their own housing authority (HA) police department, omitted from the list the HA of the City of Waterbury, Waterbury, CT, and the Buffalo HA, Buffalo, NY, and incorrectly included the Newark Housing Authority, Newark, NJ. In addition, the listing for the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development, NYC, NY, should have read: New York City Public Housing Authority, NYC, NY. This notice corrects the April 1, 1994 PHDEP NOFA by republishing the entire list of eligible applicants under paragraph I.(c)(1)(ii) to add the two omitted HAs to the list, to delete the one incorrectly listed, and to amend the listing for the New York City Public Housing Authority.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This notice also corrects the number of points that will be awarded under the first selection criterion of the NOFA. Specifically, five points are added to the subcriteria at sections I.(d)(1) (v) and (vi), raising each to 15 points, and raising the total number of points to 130.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

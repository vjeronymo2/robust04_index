			<p><P> August 24, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P>  THE BUTCHER: A PRIME GATHERING OF MEAT PROCESSORS IN IOWA  </P> <P> They came from all over the country -- indeed from around the world -- to Des  Moines, Iowa, for the 50th anniversary of the American Assn. of Meat Processors  (AAMP). I have never seen so many butchers in one place at one time in my life.  There were hundreds of us and you thought we were a vanishing breed. Many  brought their families: sons and daughters who will almost certainly be the  ones who do -- if indeed anyone does -- carry on the proud tradition of quality  custom meat cutting and processing in the country for the next 50 years.  </P> <P> Dozens of them brought their hams and bacons, sausage, dried beef, jerky,  bologna, salami and such to enter in the American Cured Meat Championships.  Maybe the real reason so many brought the children was to help carry all those  coolers full of meat products for the competition.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Same Old Names  </P> <P> There was not much new in the ham competition; some of the same old names came  out on top. Burger's Smokehouse in California, Mo.; Wood's Smoked Meats from  Bowling Green, and Mom 'n Pop's Smoked Meats from Claremont, N.C., took first,  second and third, respectively, in the smoked country ham category.  </P> <P> Eddy Woods of Wood's Smokehouse and Fred Keller of Mom 'n Pop's no sooner sat  down with those trophies when they were called back to pick up another first  and second, respectively, for their unsmoked hams. The three have been winning  awards regularly throughout the years. For a listing of all this year's winners  (they mainly sell their products by mail), send a self-addressed stamped  legal-sized envelope to Cured Meat Champs, P.O. Box 907, Tiburon, Calif. 94920.  </P> <P> One of the most decorated butchers in the world also was in Des Moines for the  convention. Benito Plasschaert from Ghent, Belgium, a butcher who serves kings  and queens, brought 13 of his butcher brethren from Holland, Germany, Austria  and Belgium, along with 126 different specialty meat products from Europe. I  have never seen such art work in a meat case; pates, terrines and galantines of  every description; corned beef brisket layered with hazelnuts in forcemeat,  beautiful and delicious; rolled herb-stuffed bacon slabs wrapped in grape  leaves unlike anything we have in the United States.  </P> <P> An exhibit of the latest in meat processing equipment was, as it has been for  50 years, a part of the convention. This year, they also had an antique  equipment display. It was interesting to note the basic similarity. We are  still doing the same things to meat: mincing, chopping, dicing, slicing. The  only real difference in the process is the power source. What today we do with  electricity and hydraulics, great-grandad did by hand.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Innovative Packaging  </P> <P> The most interesting and new innovation in meat processing is in the area of  packaging. It is the new packaging technology that will, I believe, most  greatly affect the eating habits in the years not far ahead. Indeed, the  changes have already begun. Packaging exists today that allows the consumer to  keep meat fresh in the refrigerator for up to 30 days. You can also put the  same vacuum-packaged meat in the freezer and keep it with no freezer burn and  no loss of quality almost indefinitely.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Directly to Oven  </P> <P> Packaging also exists today that will go from the freezer directly to the oven  or microwave and then to the table, saving not only time in the preparation  process but in cleaning up (there are no extra dishes to do).  </P> <P> It won't be long, according to many speakers at this year's convention, before  many smaller meat markets will not only offer prepared food to go, but will  deliver it to the consumer's house. The technology is there, the demand is  there and this is an area where the little guy can compete with the  supermarkets.  </P> <P> So, it won't be long before you can keep food fresh almost forever; you can  have anything you want for dinner delivered to your door; you can cook an  eight-course dinner in the oven or microwave and not have to do dishes because  everything comes in disposable containers that are attractive and durable.  </P> <P> I was expressing my wonder at all of this modern technology to one of the food  scientists in attendance who agreed: "Yes, Merle, we've come a long way in 50  years, but we've got a long way to go. Most of this new packaging material is  not biodegradable. What are we going to do with all the empty containers?"  </P></p>

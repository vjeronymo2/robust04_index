			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / International Company News: Listing on NYSE sought by Ek Chor FOLLOWING on the heels of the Brilliance China Automotive minibus manufacturer, Ek Chor China Motorcycle yesterday said it would become the second Chinese company to offer its shares to US investors and seek a listing on the New York Stock Exchange. Ek Chor is a Bermuda-based holding company that, in joint ventures with several foreign companies, operates four motorcycle and automotive parts manufacturers in mainland China. Bear Stearns, the Wall Street securities house lead-managing the issue, said Ek Chor has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to issue 4.4m shares of common stock at between Dollars 16 and Dollars 18 a share. The 4.4m shares sold to US investors will represent 28 per cent of the company - the rest will remain in the hands of Ek Chor's main shareholder, CP Pokphand, a subsidiary of CP Group, the Asian agri-industrial conglomerate. Bear Stearns also said that application has been made to have Ek Chor's shares listed on the NYSE. Last year Brilliance China became the first Chinese company to list its stock on the NYSE, the world's biggest equity market. Shares in Pokphand, Ek Chor's parent, are also listed on the NYSE.</p>

			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Expanding Ross drops to Pounds 0.6m Adverse currency movements, a delay in receiving a large engineering contract and a disappointing performance in consumer electronics all contributed to depress first half profits at Ross Group. The pre-tax line for the six months to June 30 was down from Pounds 1.35m to Pounds 602,000, on turnover of Pounds 27.3m (Pounds 23.5m). The shares fell 6p to 23p. Earnings came out at 0.29p, against 0.73p (0.4p adjusting for profit from the sale of properties in 1992). The interim dividend is held at 0.2p. Ross is to buy two companies, Cascade and Keenon, from Tomei of Hong Kong for Pounds 4m. Cascade is a consumer electronics company; Keenon provides sourcing, shipping and inspection services in the Far East. The consideration will be satisfied by the issue to Tomei of 13.3m new shares at 30p. Tomei will also subscribe for an additional 2.3m shares worth Pounds 700,000 to finance future expansion.</p>

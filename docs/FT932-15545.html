			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / Unionist anger at SDLP meeting with Sinn Fein UNIONIST politicians reacted angrily yesterday to the weekend meeting between Sinn Fein and Social Democratic and Labour party leaders, suggesting that any repetition could jeopardise their participation in talks about Northern Ireland's future. Mr Peter Robinson, deputy leader of Mr Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionist party, told BBC Radio that no 'self-respecting' Unionist would be involved in any talks while the SDLP was engaged in the twin process of having discussions with provisional IRA representatives. Mr Robinson said that Mr John Hume, leader of the mainly Roman Catholic SDLP, had 'given the Provisional IRA a considerable leg up at a time when their propaganda was much needed to resolve the many problems they had within the organisation from the Warrington bombings'. Mr Hume and Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, met for 90 minutes in Londonderry on Saturday at the instigation of a group of Roman Catholic clergymen. The meeting followed abortive talks last week between IRA leaders and Irish Senator Gordon Wilson, whose daughter was killed in the 1987 bombing at Enniskillen. The government, which is trying to revive the stalled roundtable talks on the province, responded cautiously to the initiative, saying only that it was 'a matter for Mr Hume'. The government of the Irish Republic was slightly less guarded, saying it did not believe Mr Hume would have 'engaged in such contacts if they did not appear worthwhile'. The last round of discussions between Unionists, the SDLP and the non-sectarian Alliance party broke up without agreement in November. In a further indication of the problems involved in getting these talks restarted, Mr John Taylor, the Ulster Unionist MP for Strangford, yesterday said he had little time for them. The way to a settlement was for bilateral talks between the government and the main political parties separately, he argued. The government should then come out with proposals. Meanwhile, the IRA yesterday issued an uncompromising message that the 'violent denial of their national rights' would continue to be met with armed resistance in Northern Ireland and elsewhere. A spokesman said the IRA was ready to talk to the British government at any time but said that dialogue must be without preconditions.</p>

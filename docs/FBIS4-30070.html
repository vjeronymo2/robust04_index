			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 23 KYODO -- Japan's largest supermarket  chain Daiei Inc., applying for Chinese Government approval to  operate across the country, will open an outlet in Shanghai next  year, its president Isao Nakauchi said Thursday [23 June].    Another major Japanese supermarket chain Yaohan  International  Group headquartered in Hong Kong, opened an outlet in Shanghai  in May and has announced it will open 1,000 more outlets in the  area from Shanghai to Beijing.    However, Daiei is the first Japanese supermarket chain  eyeing  nationwide operations in China.    Learning China plans to give a license for nationwide  operations to only one or two foreign retailers, Nakauchi said  he recently visited the country and applied for a license.    Daiei will pump about 3 billion yen into the planned  Shanghai  outlet, which is going to be a full-scale supermarket store to  serve as a pilot outlet on Chinese soil, he said.    Daiei will establish joint ventures with Chinese companies,  Nakauchi said, adding that Shanghai is now examining candidate  Chinese firms.    He said he has not decided on the number of outlets to be  opened in the country, although some industry people estimate  the number will be around 300.    Industry sources said China will decide on a license after  seeing how Daiei's Shanghai outlet does. There are competitors  from the United States and Europe also applying for licenses,  they added.</p>

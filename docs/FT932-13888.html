			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / International Company News: CRA claims success in bid for coal producer CRA, the Australian resources group, yesterday claimed success in its ADollars 716m (Dollars 504.2m) takeover bid for Coal &amp; Allied Industries (Cail), a prominent coal producer. CRA, which is 49 per cent owned by RTZ of the UK, said it was entitled to 50.03 per cent of Cail shares following acceptances received since its ADollars 11.50 a share offer was launched on March 26. The offer is CRA's second attempt to win Cail, the biggest coal mining group in New South Wales. CRA owns 40 per cent of Cail following a ADollars 8.50-a-share offer in 1991.</p>

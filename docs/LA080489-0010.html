			<p><P> August 4, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> YOUTHS PLAY WITH GUN; CHULA VISTA GIRL, 13, IS KILLED  </P> <P> A 13-year-old girl was fatally wounded Wednesday in Chula Vista when she was  shot with a gun belonging to a U. S. Border Patrol agent that the agent's son  and the girl's younger brother had been playing with, authorities said  Thursday.  </P> <P> Crystal Ray Ross, 13, of the 700 block of Date Avenue, was pronounced dead  about 1 a.m. Thursday at UCSD Medical Center, according to Deputy Coroner Jerry  Hillbrand.  </P> <P> She was shot once in the head about 7:30 p.m. Wednesday, said Chula Vista  Police Sgt. Richard Strickland.  </P> <P> Crystal and her 11-year-old brother were at an apartment in the 200 block of  Quintard Street where her 14-year-old boyfriend lived with his parents,  Strickland said. The names of the Border Patrol officer and the boys were not  released.  </P> <P> The youths had been at the apartment for about an hour when the shooting  occurred. The boyfriend's parents were at work.  </P> <P> The youths found a .357 Magnum and bullets in a bedroom, Strickland said.  Knives and ammunition were found in a box in a closet and the gun was found  under a floorboard, Strickland said.  </P> <P> The weapons belonged to the boyfriend's father, a Border Patrol agent,  Strickland said.  </P> <P> The 11-year-old boy loaded a "wad cutter" -- a bullet used for target shooting  -- into the gun, Strickland said. The gun was left on the floor, where  Crystal's boyfriend picked it up a short while later, thinking it was empty,  Strickland said.  </P></p>

			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / International Company News: AlliedSignal to buy Ford spark plug unit AlliedSignal, the US automotive components and aerospace multinational, is to challenge Robert Bosch, Champion, Japan's NGK and other rivals in the European market for vehicle spark plugs. It has reached an agreement in principle under which it will acquire, for an undisclosed sum, Ford's only remaining spark plug manufacturing operations worldwide, at Treforest in Wales. Initially the plant, which employs 330 people, will continue to be the source of Ford's only spark plug supplies in Europe. However, it will quickly seek other European customers, Mr Ralph Reins, president of AlliedSignal Automotive, said yesterday. AlliedSignal, which employs more than 100,000 people worldwide and whose automotive operations include Bendix braking systems, Garrett and other motor component names, is already the sole supplier of spark plugs to Ford in North America, where it manufactures around 250m plugs annually. The Treforest facility makes 30m spark plugs a year, used by Ford as original equipment and sold in the after-market under the Motocraft brand name. However, such production volume is regarded by Ford as uneconomic in a European markets which absorbs about 1bn spark plugs a year. In common with the 'outsourcing' policies of other car makers, it is steadily disposing of what it regards as non-core manufacturing activities. The agreement should be finalised in time for the Treforest facility to become part of AlliedSignal's filters and spark plugs division on January 1. The division employs 3,800 and had sales of over Dollars 400m in 1993. The plugs will use Motocraft and Autolite brand names. AlliedSignal already has almost 1,600 employees in the UK, based mainly in Carlisle and Skelmersdale, manufacturing seat belt systems and turbochargers.</p>

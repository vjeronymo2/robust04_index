			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Lawyers say Lords unlikely to hear Paramount appeal Lawyers close to the Paramount Airways action said yesterday that the House of Lords was unlikely to hear their appeal in the case, which has thrown eight years of insolvency practice into doubt, before the autumn. The appeal was formally launched yesterday by administrators at accountancy firm Touche Ross. The delay means a period of uncertainty for receivers and administrators before they know whether they will face claims from thousands of employees in companies which have run into difficulties. The details emerged as the insolvency (No 2) bill was debated in the House of Lords yesterday after passing its Commons stages on Monday. It will ensure that only employees' wages, salaries and pension contributions will rank as preferential creditors to companies in receivership and administration.</p>

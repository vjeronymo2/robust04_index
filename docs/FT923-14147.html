			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Shares fall in renewed uncertainties WORRIES over the outlook for sterling and for other world stock markets returned to haunt London yesterday, and UK equities lost most of their gains of the previous session as fund managers backed away again. The absence of convincing progress on global economic problems at the G7 summit was a discouraging factor. Turnover remained poor, and the trend for the day was set early in the session by the fall of 44 Dow points on Wall Street overnight. Lingering hopes of an early cut in UK base rates received a further blow from sterling's weakness in the ERM range. Confidence in a consumer-led recovery was dented yet again when the chairman of Dixon's, the high street retailer, said that UK consumers were still 'not spending' on major household appliances. At the day's low point, the FT-SE Index was down by nearly 40 points. Equities steadied toward the close, helped by a similar trend in New York where the Dow was a mere 3.78 off in UK hours, and by a rally in the Footsie future which regained the 2,500 mark lost earlier in the day. Also helping market sentiment was the reiteration by Mr John Major, UK prime minister, of official forecasts that the UK economy will grow by 1 per cent this year; some stock market strategists have been less sanguine. The final reading showed the FT-SE Index at 2,472.6, a net loss of 21.1. Traders drew comfort from the market's rally from the day's low of 2,454.6, which suggested that 2,450 is still a support line for the market. First dealings in The Telegraph public issue, largely left with underwriters last week, fared little better then expected, ending the session at a discount of 42 to the issue price of 325p. Seaq-reported volume, the catch-all figures which take in both retail and intra-market business, improved to 396.1m shares from the 381.8m of the previous session. However, dealers saw little advance in the level of retail, or customer driven business in equities, which remained unimpressive at Pounds 844m on Tuesday, according to Stock Exchange statistics. The overnight setback on Wall Street touched a nerve in the London market where analysts believe that the New York stock market is still over-valued, and fear that this could prove a time bomb lurking beneath global stock markets. Uncertainty over the progress of world economies was further tested by reports that the chairman of RTZ, the global metals and trading company, had told stockbrokers in Tokyo that he was surprised by the strength of copper prices in view of the absence of evidence that world recession is ending. This morning is expected to bring a rash of bear-closing in the London market by traders needing stock to meet selling commitments entered into over the two week trading account which closes tomorrow. The Footsie has bounced convincingly at the 2,450 area this week; however, the near term outlook is dependent upon a Wall Street market which this week again demonstrated its ability to unsettle London.</p>

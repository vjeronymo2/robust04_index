			<p><P> June 30, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN ONE;  </P> <P> TURNING A DEAF EAR TO CONFESSION;  </P> <P> A MAN KEEPS ADMITTING TO A SLAYING FOR WHICH HIS BROTHER IS IMPRISONED. THE  CASE ILLUSTRATES HOW LOATH APPEALS COURTS ARE TO OVERTURN CONVICTIONS.  </P> <P> Xavier Sanders has confessed repeatedly to a 1985 fatal shooting in Compton. He  has confessed to lawyers, to his family, to a court in a sworn statement, and  most recently, to a newspaper reporter. But the authorities won't do anything  about it.  </P> <P> It's not that what Sanders says is beyond belief. Some of the eyewitnesses  initially identified him as the gunman.  </P> <P> The problem is that Xavier's brother Sheldon has already been convicted of the  crime, and authorities have closed the books on the case.  </P> <P> The situation seems absurd: Sheldon Sanders, who says he is innocent, is in  prison -- possibly for life -- while Xavier, who repeatedly confesses, is free.  Or, as Xavier told The Times, "He's doing the time for something he didn't do.  And I did it."  </P> <P> Yet, not only prosecutors, but the appellate courts as well, have been  unwilling to intervene.  </P> <P> Appeals courts are sometimes criticized by law-and-order advocates for being  too willing to free guilty criminals on technicalities. Yet experts say appeals  courts rarely reverse convictions and, if anything, fail to hold police,  prosecutors and judges accountable to fair trial standards because of their  desire to affirm convictions whenever possible.  </P> <P> Intent on overturning convictions only if flagrant violations of due process  are found, they are not particularly good at detecting innocence, research  shows. As former U.S. Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart once explained, it  is not their job.  </P> <P> "It is not the function of this court to determine innocence or guilt," he  wrote. "Our duty is to uphold the Constitution."  </P> <P> Gerald Uelmen, dean of the Santa Clara University Law School and president of  the California Academy of Appellate Lawyers, said the Sanders' case is "a  textbook example" of appeals courts' reluctance to second-guess trial judges  and juries -- even if it means they have to "almost put blinders on."  </P> <P> Why the reluctance?  </P> <P> Some critics charge that the answer is simple: the legal system does not want  to admit its mistakes. "Everybody likes to bury their mistakes in this system,"  said Leslie Abramson, a defense lawyer who tried unsuccessfully to reopen  Sheldon Sanders' case.  </P> <P> But prosecutors insist that is not so. "I'm not saying mistakes aren't made,"  said Steven Sowders, head of the district attorney's Compton office, where the  prosecution took place. "I think I'm fairly open-minded about those things."  </P> <P> But Sowders said he thinks no mistake was made in this case. He said he thinks  Xavier Sanders' confessions are merely an attempt to trick authorities into  freeing his brother, at little risk to Xavier himself.  </P> <P> If Xavier Sanders is charged with the shooting and tried, he might well be  acquitted, the prosecutor said. He could tell a jury that his confessions were  a ruse to free his brother. He could also note that all five eyewitnesses who  testified at Sheldon Sanders' trial said that Sheldon -- not Xavier -- was the  gunman.  </P> <P> "We're not going to get caught in that," the prosecutor said.  </P> <P> For his part, Xavier Sanders said he knows authorities do not believe him. But  the unemployed 27-year-old man, who has a criminal record of robbery, cocaine  and weapons convictions, declared: "I wouldn't lie about something like this  here. I done come forward so many times, they should get the hint."  </P> <P> The state Court of Appeal, meanwhile, recently adopted prosecutors' reasoning  in refusing to grant a new trial to Sheldon Sanders, who is 24 and serving a  17-year-to-life sentence for murder -- his first offense.  </P> <P> But in doing so, the court raised the ire of one judge, Earl Johnson, who wrote  a scathing dissent, arguing that the court was relying on speculation to "save  the present conviction" and, in the process, giving justice a back seat to  expediency.  </P> <P> That was just part of one of the sharpest and most bitter exchanges between  state Court of Appeal justices in memory -- with each side accusing the other  of intellectual dishonesty and the majority going so far as to liken Johnson's  analysis to that of "a first-year law school student."  </P> <P> Johnson, who is known for his liberal stances on social issues, is also known  as among the brightest justices on the court.  </P> <P> "This is not one of the typical cases where the issue on appeal is whether a  guilty man should be let free because he was convicted through illegally  obtained evidence," he wrote. "Nor is it a case where the error asserted on  appeal would reduce the prosecution's evidence of appellant's guilt to  something less than guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. No, this is one of those  rare cases where . . . the . . . error . . . goes to the core issue of the  defendant's innocence."  </P> <P> And that may be another part of the problem. Claims of innocence sometimes  throw appeals courts for a loop. "They don't know how to deal with innocence,"  said Abramson. In fact, state law does not allow a convict to appeal simply on  the grounds that he is innocent. Guilt or innocence is the domain of the trial  judge and jury.  </P> <P> Appeals courts are set up to decide broad policy questions and to regulate the  conduct of the lower trial courts and of police and prosecutors by insisting  that convictions be arrived at fairly.  </P> <P> They reverse convictions only on questions of law, as opposed to fact, and only  when they have to -- which usually means that the convict's rights were  violated in a particularly flagrant way.  </P> <P> "They really are not sitting as the 13th juror," said Patricia Nelson of the  California Appellate Project, which advises appeals lawyers representing  indigent criminal defendants. "In cases of factual innocence, the only strong  case you can come in with is where the prosecutor has hidden evidence. But  where the defense has ineptly or maliciously failed to put on the very same  evidence, then you're in deep trouble."  </P> <P> This reflects the reluctance of the Court of Appeal to reverse convictions  because defense lawyers were incompetent.  </P> <P> "It's very hard to convince a reviewing court that . . . counsel dropped the  ball," said Uelmen, the Santa Clara Law School dean, "and the reality . . . is  that there's a hell of a lot of incompetence out there, and the court should  look at those claims seriously."  </P> <P> In the Sanders case, for instance, the jury that convicted Sheldon never  learned that Xavier had confessed.  </P> <P> That was because Sheldon Sanders' lawyer literally told Xavier to get lost.  </P> <P> Justice Johnson in his dissent said this was a crucial omission -- and  indicative of incompetence.  </P> <P> "Can anyone seriously question," he wrote, "the devastating impact of a witness  testifying, 'The defendant didn't do it. I did it?' "  </P> <P> However, the two-justice majority guessed that Sheldon Sanders' attorney had a  good reason for not introducing testimony about Xavier's confessions -- making  the question of the confessions' potential impact on jurors legally moot.  </P> <P> The attorney, Philip Jefferson, was not available for questioning because he  had left the state after being disbarred for a 10-year-pattern of misconduct in  the handling of clients' cases.  </P> <P> But the majority surmised, in a decision written by Justice Fred Woods, that  Jefferson might have known that Xavier Sanders' confessions were false and  decided not to present them because it would have been unethical for a lawyer  to knowingly present lies in court.  </P> <P> Justice Woods, in an opinion in which Justice Mildred Lillie concurred, accused  Johnson of making an argument characterized by "transparent triviality . . .  more befitting a first-year law school student aflush with issue-spotting  passion" than a justice of the Court of Appeal.  </P> <P> Woods said it was evident that members of Sheldon Sanders' family were willing  to perjure themselves. He noted that some family members had testified that  Sheldon was home at the time of the killing.  </P> <P> But, according to Xavier Sanders' confessions, Sheldon had accompanied him to a  spot near the scene of the crime.  </P> <P> Clearly, someone in the Sanders family had lied, and Woods wrote that he  thought it was Xavier. He said Xavier's confessions had the "damning odor of  recently manufactured evidence."  </P> <P> Johnson termed this pure speculation. "Unless a higher court intervenes," he  wrote, "this (decision) will be enough to condemn the brother who proclaims his  innocence -- and could well be innocent -- to spend his best years in prison  while the brother who admits the crime remains free."  </P> <P> Experts say it is unlikely that the state Supreme Court will get involved. That  court, the state's highest, must hear death penalty appeals and lawyer  disciplinary cases. Other than that, it chooses the cases it wants to hear with  an eye toward making broad public policy.  </P> <P> "I don't think there is a chance you can get a case like this heard by the  Supreme Court anymore," Uelmen said. "The Court of Appeal (the state's  intermediate appellate court, which must hear all appeals from convicted  felons) is the end of the line when you're talking about whether justice was  done in a particular case. The California Supreme Court . . . is interested in  cases that will have a major impact on the law. And cases like this don't fall  into that category. There's no room on the docket for a case like this."  </P> <P> In a landmark 1982 study of how a California Court of Appeal works, Thomas  Davies, of the American Bar Foundation, remarked on the essentially  conservative nature of the appellate process.  </P> <P> "The data . . . tend to refute any notion that the Court of Appeal is eager or  even willing to reverse serious convictions on the basis of procedural  technicalities," Davies wrote. "The more appropriate question is whether the  very restrained review of criminal proceedings . . . is adequate for the  enforcement of due process standards in the trial courts."  </P> <P> Part of the justices' concern, researchers say, is not to make unnecessary and  demoralizing work for trial judges by sending back too many cases for them to  try again. And part of the concern is not to let guilty people go free.  </P> <P> Most criminal cases on appeal involve serious, even horrendous crimes where  there is little doubt about a convict's guilt. In California, 17 of every 18  appealed convictions are affirmed.  </P> <P> Justices have told academic researchers that they find procedural errors in  virtually all trials, but tend to call them harmless.  </P> <P> Justices also avoid second-guessing trial courts as long as they can find any  substantial evidence -- contradicted or not -- to support a trial court's  decision.  </P> <P> Some justices have spoken frankly and harshly in off-the-record talks with  researchers by comparing their processing of these cases to "getting rid of the  garbage" or dealing with "these rotten little cases."  </P> <P> But a problem can arise when an innocent man appeals.  </P> <P> While no one knows how many people are wrongly convicted each year, C. Ronald  Huff, director of the Criminal Justice Research Center at Ohio State  University, has collected estimates from law enforcement professionals, most of  whom believe that wrongful convictions occur less than 1% of the time.  </P> <P> If the true error rate was only one-half of 1% in serious felony cases, that  would still mean 6,000 wrongful convictions nationwide every year, Huff said.  </P> <P> Huff also collected accounts of 500 cases in which the government ultimately  admitted it convicted the wrong man. Appeals courts had affirmed convictions in  most of them.  </P> <P> To account for this, Huff coined "the ratification of error principle," which  holds that the more people in authority who look at a case, the greater the  chances are that they will not look at it carefully, because they are inclined  to trust the judgments of those who have looked at it before.  </P> <P> Although the Sanders case is tangled, what is known is that 18-year-old Norman  Gregory became a victim of senseless violence. He was shot to death at the  Gregory family's Compton home.  </P> <P> What is also known is that Sheldon Sanders had reason to be angry with the  Gregorys. One of Sheldon's older brothers was married to Norman Gregory's  sister, and she had reportedly accused Sheldon of hitting her.  </P> <P> When Sheldon showed up at the Gregory household, Norman and another of the  Gregory brothers punched him and threw a rock at his car windshield, cracking  it. Sheldon Sanders sped away, reportedly saying he would be back to get  revenge.  </P> <P> A short time later, a car containing three men pulled up at the Gregory house.  Only one of them got out.  </P> <P> He had a rifle and fired a shot at one of the Gregory family's cars, breaking  its window.  </P> <P> Then, as the Gregory brothers and some friends gathered at the front door, the  gunman walked toward the house.  </P> <P> Those at the door testified that the gunman taunted them before firing a shot  that penetrated the door. It struck and killed Norman Gregory.  </P> <P> Then the gunman got back in his car and fled.  </P> <P> In his confessions, Xavier Sanders claimed that he was the gunman but that he  taunted no one.  </P> <P> In a distinction that could mean the difference between murder and the lesser  crime of manslaughter, Xavier Sanders claimed he didn't know the Gregory  brothers were standing at the door and didn't realize his shot had hit anyone  until later.  </P> <P> He said Sheldon Sanders and another of his brothers were with him, but stayed  in the car and had no idea he was going to shoot.  </P> <P> Once he learned that Norman Gregory had been shot, he said he confessed to his  mother. She confirms this. He said he then retained a lawyer and confessed to  him too. The lawyer also confirms this.  </P> <P> But when he was arrested as a suspect in the shooting, he refused to talk to  police, and the police let him go. Only Sheldon Sanders was charged.  </P> <P> Eyewitness accounts were conflicting. Some initially identified Xavier Sanders  as the gunman, according to police reports, but all later agreed the gunman was  the slighter-built Sheldon Sanders.  </P> <P> At Sheldon's first trial, which resulted in a hung jury, Xavier Sanders was  summoned as a witness by the defense, but invoked his Fifth Amendment right not  to incriminate himself on the advice of a court-appointed lawyer.  </P> <P> When the district attorney's office sought to try Sheldon Sanders a second  time, the family switched lawyers, hiring Jefferson.  </P> <P> "We told Mr. Jefferson that Xavier was the one who fired the rifle," said the  brothers' mother, Regina Sanders. "We just wanted justice to be served right  because Sheldon did not shoot that boy."  </P> <P> But Jefferson did not want to talk with Xavier, Mrs. Sanders said.  </P> <P> At one point, she said, she brought Xavier to the courtroom during the second  trial and told Jefferson, "Xavier is here to testify."  </P> <P> But she said Jefferson told Xavier to go away.  </P> <P> "I left," Xavier recalled.  </P> <P> "My understanding was that . . . I guess he had a better chance of doing  whatever he was going to do without exposing me. He could have been under the  impression that I was lying, I don't know, because I never talked to him. He  could have been doing it for my own good."  </P> <P> Whatever Jefferson was doing, it didn't work.  </P> <P> After Sheldon Sanders was convicted, his family hired another attorney,  Abramson, who obtained a sworn written confession from Xavier, which was filed  in court. She also interested attorney Rowan Klein in the case.  </P> <P> Klein and Sheldon Sanders' appellate attorney, R. Charles Johnson, then  persuaded the Court of Appeal to ask the judge who had presided at the second  trial to hold a hearing.  </P> <P> Although Xavier Sanders confessed to Klein on tape and agreed to testify, he  got cold feet on the witness stand. While he made a series of admissions,  saying that he was the only one who had gotten out of the car and was the only  one with a gun, he stopped short of saying he fired it.  </P> <P> Instead, he followed the advice of another court-appointed lawyer and invoked  the Fifth Amendment on that question.  </P> <P> "I don't know why I didn't say it," he told The Times. "I was ready to say it.  But the whole thing changed. The judge got an attorney for me. They got that  attorney to speak for me."  </P></p>

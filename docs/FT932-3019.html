			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / Shares in water up on Wessex results THE privatised UK water sector, overshadowed recently by regulatory worries, rallied yesterday after better-than-expected results from Wessex Water, one of the smallest of the 10 companies. Wessex reported a 12 per cent increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 76.9m to Pounds 86m in the year to March 31. Wessex's shares gained 12p to 570p. Other water companies which have seen their shares fall sharply in the last month, such as North West and Welsh, rose by as much as 3 per cent. Mr Nicholas Hood, chairman, said the results were 'excellent'. 'I'm proud of it, but not smug,' he said. Wessex's unregulated businesses, mainly the joint venture with Waste Management International of the US, performed well, contributing Pounds 7.1m after interest costs compared with Pounds 2.7m last year. Another unregulated business, contractor Wimpey Wessex, recorded a Pounds 200,000 loss on a contract and is to be closed. Group turnover increased 8 per cent, in line with average price increases, to Pounds 205.6m. Operating costs were unchanged and helped toward a 20 per cent increase in operating profits of Pounds 81m. In January, Wessex raised Pounds 144.5m through a rights issue and other funding to pay for its share of the acquisition cost of the waste arm of NFC, the transport group. Proceeds from the issue helped improve Wessex's net cash position from Pounds 15m to Pounds 54m by the year end. However, the timing of cash flows made interest income fall sharply, from Pounds 8.5m to Pounds 500,000. Capital expenditure on improving water and sewerage quality peaked at Pounds 130m. Depreciation increased 10 per cent to Pounds 21.1m. Streamlining acquisitions led to cost savings which were expected to continue. Mr Hood said price increases of between 5 and 15 per cent had been achieved at some of the landfills acquired through the NFC purchase. Fully diluted earnings were affected by a higher tax charge and increased 6 per cent to 60.1p. The company recommended a final dividend of 14.2p to make a total of 21.5p, an increase of 10 per cent. Mr Hood said the increase was partly justified by the rising contribution from unregulated businesses. Lex, Page 20</p>

This statement reveals a lot more about the attitudes of the author  than it does about society. To attribute outrage over sadistic attacks on  innocent people to "middle-class values" is to side with the fundamental  assumptions of the Manson point of view.  </P> <P> Tell me, in which social class in America is sadistic murder regarded as  acceptable?  </P> <P> LARRY SELK  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

(Tableware) Sherrill and Oneida, NY <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An application has been submitted to the Foreign-Trade Zones Board (the Board) by the County of Oneida, New York, grantee of FTZ 172, requesting special-purpose subzone status for the manufacturing facilities of Oneida Ltd. in Sherrill and Oneida, New York. The application was submitted pursuant to the provisions of the Foreign-Trade Zones Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 81a-81u), and the regulations of the Board (15 CFR part 400). It was formally filed on June 7, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Oneida facilities involve three sites in Sherrill (Oneida County) and Oneida (Madison County), New York: Site 1 (116 acres)_Main Plant, East Seneca Street and Route 5, Sherrill; Site 2 (63 acres)_Knife Plant, Kenwood Avenue, Sherrill; and Site 3 (0.5 acres)_warehouse facility (D.J. Warehouse), Wilson Street, Oneida. The facilities (2500 employees) are used to manufacture a full line of stainless steel, silverplated and sterling silver flatware (knives, forks and spoons) as well as certain hollowware (tea services, bowls, trays, cups). The facilities are also used to warehouse/package/distribute porcelain, chinaware, crystal and miscellaneous giftware. Certain finished and semi-finished items, accounting for up to 15 percent of sales, are sourced from abroad to fill out product lines. (Stainless steel mill products are sourced domestically.) Oneida is requesting to use zone procedures only for silverplating of foreign-sourced stainless steel tableware and for warehousing and packaging of finished products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Zone procedures would exempt Oneida from Customs duty payments on foreign items that are exported. On domestic sales, the company would be able to choose the duty rates that apply to the finished silverplated products (4.5 to 6.0%). The duty rates on foreign-sourced stainless steel tableware items used in the silverplating activity range from 6 to 17 percent. The application indicates that the savings from zone procedures would help improve the plant's international competitiveness.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with the Board's regulations, a member of the FTZ Staff has been designated examiner to investigate the application and report to the Board.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Public comment is invited from interested parties. Submissions (original and 3 copies) shall be addressed to the Board's Executive Secretary at the address below. The closing period for their receipt is August 15, 1994. Rebuttal comments in response to material submitted during the foregoing period may be submitted during the subsequent 15-day period (to Tuesday, August 30, 1994).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A copy of the application and accompanying exhibits will be available for public inspection at each of the following locations: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> Office of the Port Director, U.S. Customs Service, Syracuse Hancock International Airport, Air Cargo Building, P.O.

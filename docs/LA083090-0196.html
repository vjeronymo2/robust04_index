			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH;  </P> <P> 'PIERFEST' TO RAISE MONEY FOR NEW PIER  </P> <P> You've heard of a German "beerfest." But are you ready for a "pierfest?"  </P> <P> Old World Village has announced it will be launching its traditional,  month-long beerfest on Sept. 8 with "a pierfest night" to raise money for a new  pier for Huntington Beach.  </P> <P> "It starts at 6:30 p.m. . . . and all proceeds from the $5 admission cost will  go to the pier," said Bern Bischof, coordinator of the fund-raising event.  "We're calling it a pierfest because it's the first night of our September  beerfest."  </P> <P> A band from West Germany will provide live music, and there will be door prizes  and raffles, Bischof said. There will be a Miss Oktoberfest competition, and  the judges will include Mayor Thomas J. Mays, Bischof said.  </P> <P> "We're doing this because we're residents of Huntington Beach, and the pier is  the heart of Huntington Beach," Bischof said. "The pier here is known all over  the world, and our goal is to help raise money for the new pier."  </P> <P> Activities will include the chance to sample various beers and vote on them.  </P> <P> "'Because of the recent reunification movement in Germany, we'll be able to let  people taste East German beer along with beers from West Germany," Bischof  said.  </P> <P> Old World Village is on Center Avenue north of the Huntington Center Mall.

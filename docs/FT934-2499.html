			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / Tories threaten to rebel over guillotine The government could face a rebellion by Tory backbenchers in the Commons today when it takes its first steps to rush through two key pieces of revenue-raising legislation. Three backbench Tory MPs said last night that they were deeply unhappy about today's 'guillotine' motion, which aims to get bills reducing the statutory sick pay subsidy to employers and raising National Insurance contributions from employees' through all their Commons stages by Thursday night. Mr Richard Shepherd, MP for Arlidge-Brownhills, said that he would abstain from voting on today's guillotine motion and on both bills later in the week. He believes the decision to push the legislation through quickly is an 'infringement of free speech'. The other two backbenchers, Mr Nicholas Winterton, MP for Macclesfield, and Mr Patrick Cormack, MP for Staffordshire South, said that they were considering abstaining, also in the belief that the guillotine will give MPs too little time to consider the issues. The government's majority of 17 means that ministers remain confident that the legislation will pass on time and without hitches. But the rebellion will put additional pressure on Tory whips after Labour's decision to protest against the guillotine and abandon its arrangement to 'pair off' MPs with opponents so that both can be absent during divisions. Mr Derek Foster, Labour's chief whip, believes this move may make life difficult for government whips, who will have to ensure that sufficient MPs are in the Commons to vote the measures through. Mr David Winnick, Labour MP for Walsall North, said there would be no consensus over proposed reforms to the hours of Commons sittings 'as long as the government treats the House with the contempt it is showing this week'. If today's guillotine is passed, the Statutory Sick Pay Bill will be debated for no more than six hours tomorrow, with MPs voting at 10pm. The debate raising the National Insurance contribution will go through the same curtailed procedures on Thursday. After consideration by the Lords, both bills should be on the statute book in the new year. It is not unusual for legislation to pass through the Commons at such speed, but Labour says it is almost unprecedented so early in a parliamentary session. Ministers say the sick pay and National Insurance legislation have to be on the statute book quickly so that employers can make provision for the changes. The measures will raise about Pounds 2.5bn for the Exchequer next year.</p>

			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / Brazilian growth plan prepared: Government wants to cut inflation and create 4m jobs in two years BRAZIL'S new government has outlined a general strategy to promote growth and reduce inflation. But the scheme for achieving these goals, presented by Mr Paulo Haddad, planning minister, was short on details. He failed to address structural reforms such as privatisation, a programme which President Itamar Franco suspended and promised to re-initiate under unspecified new rules. The key points included the elimination of public waste and corruption through increased oversight and administrative decentralisation, a gradual reduction of interest rates, tripartite sectoral accords negotiated with business and labour, and the liberalisation of certain investment rules to attract foreign capital. Mr Franco hopes to generate 4m jobs during the two years left of the term he inherited from Mr Fernando Collor de Mello, who resigned last week. The government estimates that there are 8m unemployed in Brazil's big cities. The government aims to cut inflation from 25 to 10 per cent a month by the end of 1993, and to what Mr Haddad called 'civilised levels', 2-4 per cent a month by December 1994. The strategy for 'selective growth', as Mr Haddad put it, partly depends on the co-operation of business and labour. The model will be an accord last year in the automotive sector, where industry reduced prices and guaranteed job stability, labour moderated salary demands, and the government cut taxes. Mr Franco is calling Congress back from its summer recess on January 11 to address fiscal reform. Reform would also make room for the gradual reduction of interest rates, said Mr Haddad.</p>

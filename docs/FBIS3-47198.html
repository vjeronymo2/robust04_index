			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Satsuki Eda, director general of the Science </F> and Technology Agency, by unidentified NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN  correspondent; place and date not given; first paragraph is  introduction]    [Text] Director General Satsuki Eda of the Science and  Technology Agency gave an interview to a NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN  correspondent concerning his views on atomic energy and science  and technology policies. In the interview, Eda stressed his  stance to render decisionmaking procedures more flexible via  such measures as public hearings on revision of the government's  long-term atomic energy program. He also disclosed Japan's  desire to construct the International Tokamak Experimental  Reactor (ITER), a new reactor being jointly developed in Japan  by Japan, the United States, Europe, and Russia. Following are  questions and answers from the interview:    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] There is an opinion among the public  that no change has been observed in the coalition's atomic  energy policy since the period of the Liberal Democratic Party  [LDP]. What is your comment?    [Eda] I have no intention to revise construction policies  for plants' reprocessing of used nuclear fuel, or for policies  promoting the fast breeder reactor [FBR] project. The coalition  took over the LDP policies on these points. However, we are  happy to hear the opinions of those who oppose the government  projects. If a public hearing is held successfully, the next  long-term atomic energy program will contain more flexible  decisionmaking procedures. To make some significant changes in  atomic energy policies, it is necessary to revise practices  established during 38 years of LDP rule.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Are you progressing in establishing  the coalition parties' consensus on atomic energy policies?    [Eda] It is true the stances of the coalition parties toward  the atomic energy policies are widely varied, and they have  never had a uniform opinion on any subject in this field. Since  atomic energy issues are evoking much controversy worldwide, it  is quite normal that the coalition parties have various opinions  on these issues. Even if there are differences in opinion, we  can still go ahead.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] It is believed a revision of the  government's long-term atomic energy program is badly behind  schedule. What is your position on this?    [Eda] The delay in revising the long-term program will not  affect any projects. While construction of demonstration  reactors for the new converter reactor and FBR will be slightly  delayed, these have nothing to do with the revision of the  program. The delay in the revision of the program is quite  normal because this is a part of policy revisions following the  political turnover.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] What are the future goals of the  science and technology policies?    [Eda] While Japan has been growing smoothly, it is now  facing a great recession. Science is a major tool to  systematically overcome the present situation. Therefore, we  must think about such drastic measures as building up  information super highways and constructing an ITER in Japan.  Economic policies should be discussed in line with the  direction of science and technology policies.</p>

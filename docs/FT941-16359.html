			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Business failures 'show 46% fall' The number of UK business failures in the final quarter of 1993 fell to the lowest level since 1989, say estimates released yesterday by Trade Indemnity, the credit insurance group. Failures encountered by Trade Indemnity's policyholders fell by 46 per cent in the fourth quarter compared with the same period in 1992. The group registered 942 business failures in the final three months of 1993, a 21 per cent fall on the previous quarter. Trade Indemnity said the figures showed a radical change in the UK business climate. 'Whilst there is usually a seasonal increase in the first quarter of the new year, it is clear that companies are at last able to concentrate their minds on expansion rather than simply survival,' the company said. Trade Indemnity warned that companies' cashflow still remained under pressure. 'The overriding message from our policyholders at present is one of margins continuing to be squeezed between price pressure from customers and higher-cost supplies.' The company said its statistics tended to reflect failure trends of more established companies. It said evidence suggested its statistics often led other available indicators by as much as six months. Trade statistics, Page 10</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article, dated 10 July 1993, by Hu Jiwei (5170 4921 0251): </F> "Optimism as to Future Developments? Or a Crisis Ridden  Future?--An Analysis of China's Present Condition and Future  Prospects." A note at the end of the article reads: "The article  originally appeared under the title `China's Direction,' but is  here given in a shortened form due to the constraints of space."]    [Text] Editor's Note: Hu Jiwei, a former president of the  RENMIN RIBAO Publishing House, had accepted the invitation for a  three-month lecture tour in the United States, during which he  gave speeches or held symposia in some ten universities and  academic societies, mainly analyzing the present condition of,  and future prospects for China. Before every lecture, Hu would  write out a draft of his speech, but he did not read from the  draft; rather, he expressed some of his views freely as the  occasion demanded. He has attracted great interest among  students of the Chinese scene. The present article points out  that the direction of China's development justifies optimism,  but that there are also serious problems. Hu also points out  that only with "peaceful gradual advance [heping jianjin]" can  China's prosperous development be ensured. [end editor's note]    The world's attention is fixed on China's internal  situation.  In my opinion, generally speaking, that situation is good; I am  optimistic as to the direction China is going.  <H5>  Small Turbulences Cannot Be Avoided </H5>   China's situation is good, especially its economic  situation.  However, some observers only look at the speed of its economic  growth and speak of it as very good. They say, for instance,  that China is already third among the large economic powers.  This, in my opinion, does not conform to reality.    Internally, China still has problems of considerable  seriousness, but then there are also observers who will only see  the bad side and make it out to be too bad. They even talk of  China being beset with crises, and think outbreaks may be  triggered at any moment, much as if China will soon be one total  chaos. That too does not conform to reality.    What one may say, I think, is that the situation is very  good, and that the developmental trend justifies optimism, but  that there are also some serious problems.    In the following I will give my reasons and my analysis:    First, in a broader perspective, to speak of the larger  basic  reason, there is the basic turn for the better in the new  international situation, which also determines the developmental  prospects for China.    The disintegration of the socialist camp and the fundamental  elimination of confrontation between the two armed camps; the  situation of having two ideological blocs facing each other,  backed by armed forces, is becoming more and more relaxed. Times  are gone when great powers staked their fate on their military  power. A new era has begun where the world situation will be one  of peaceful development.    This has a decisive influence on China's future, as China  too  will then also, inevitably, develop into a peaceful, democratic,  and modern state.    In this international situation, great changes will also,  inevitably, be engendered internally within the country. The era  of wars, when armed forces were relied upon to fight off foreign  aggression and to ensure the state's independence, has  essentially come to a close. The era of armed forces being  relied upon to consolidate the internal political system and to  protect economic construction should long ago also have come to  a close. The idea of a proletarian dictatorship--having the guns  means having everything--has already become outdated. The times  of violent revolution and violent rule have passed, never to  return.    This peaceful, democratic development cannot be reversed  anymore and cannot be stopped. Anything that stands in the way  of this great principle, any high-handed reactionary policy,  will have no chance of success, and will be compelled to undergo  change. Whatever countercurrent or whatever obstruction appear,  all will ultimately end up in defeat.    Some people believe that large-scale armed turmoil and armed  suppression may erupt in China, warlords will get tangled in  warfare in some kind of feudal separatist regime, nationalities  will split off, or ethnic fighting will break out.; however, all  these assumptions are overpessimistic. I believe it may not be  possible to avoid small disturbances, but still the possibility  of large-scale turmoil is very, very small.    In sum, viewing the overall situation, all those autocratic  powers and autocratic measures are headed for extinction, and  they are not headed for any growth in strength.  <H5>  Two Reasons for an Optimistic Attitude </H5>   There are two important reasons for my optimistic attitude  as  to the situation in China. One reason: Those democratic forces  that actively advocate learning advanced science and technology  and economic management from the capitalist countries, that  advocate importing foreign capital and technologies, and that  formerly had been thought of as the most dangerous forces of  bourgeois liberalization, are now right among, and of the  masses, and they are now the ones that are more and more  considered "advanced personalities," in that they firmly  advocate reform and opening up to the outside world. If one  were, under these circumstances, to advocate and actually try in  present-day China to strengthen total dictatorship of the  proletariat, if one were to think of inciting to "class struggle  as the key link," even extreme leftist forces who oppose that  sort of "bourgeois peaceful evolution" would become highly  unpopular. Peace is bound to replace violence, democracy is  bound to replace dictatorship, that is the developmental trend  of the world, and even more so the developmental trend in China,  and any move against this current will just get nowhere.    The second important reason is that the reform of China's  economic structure is proving increasingly successful, and that  the reform of China's economic structure has actually induced a  reform in China's political structure, which in fact has already  gained some gratifying achievements in quite a few respects.  Judging by the actual situation in China, it is not by a sudden  change, but by a gradual change that economic reform is inducing  political reform. It is a process of moving from quantitative  changes to a change in substance, it is a gradual change of  which the effects will only become apparent after the lapse of a  considerable period of time. Some people see some of the  obnoxious phenomena and conclude that things will take a sudden  turn and then develop rapidly into a gigantic chaos. I don't  agree. Some people see all the good phenomena and conclude that  the situation will become all rosy, will assume a completely new  look. That too is an unrealistic fantasy. However, judging by  the trend of overall developments, the reform of the political  structure in China will take a step forward. That is the general  trend which no man's will can deflect.    The Chinese authorities have decided on the extremely  important policy decision of "grasp with two hands, two hands?"  It is to mean grasp material civilization with one hand and  spiritual civilization with the other hand. This is of course  correct and very good, but in its actual implementation this  move was usurped by ultraleftist forces, who made it out to be  something like "oppose bourgeois liberalization" and "oppose the  bourgeois peaceful evolution." In the ideological field, they  launched a political movement to condemn and attack those who  hold different views, and what they promoted was still nothing  else but an ideological dictatorship and cultural dictatorship.  In actual fact they did not dare, and even opposed, instituting  a reform of the political structure.    After the disintegration of the Soviet Union, some  authoritative persons erroneously summed up the Soviet  experience by blaming two reasons for the disintegration of the  Soviet Union: One being the failure to institute economic  reforms, their economy having been in a depressed state for a  long time; and the other, having first started a political  reform, when people were allowed to think and speak out, thereby  confounding the political situation. The said "authoritative  persons" then decided to go the opposite way: If the Soviets  failed to start economic reforms, they would precisely start  economic reforms; that was right. If the Soviets started  political reform, they would precisely not start political  reforms, but that was wrong. This is in reality creating the  lopsided situation of economic reform without political reform.  Some of these "authoritative persons" would even concoct the  theory that economic reform without political reform is the only  way that will suit the national condition of China, and they  would arrive at the important policy decision that they would  thereby be creating socialism with Chinese characteristics. In  actual fact, this is totally wrong.  <H5>  Economic Reform Without Political Reform Is a Monstrosity </H5>   According to the actual situation during the ten years that  followed our smashing the Gang of Four, economic reform has in  fact frequently been conducted accompanied by political reform,  and any mechanical separation of the two is impossible. First,  did we not smash the autocratic regime of the Cultural  Revolution time with its feudal, fascist dictatorship, which was  then followed by the discussion of truthful objectives and the  achievement of a liberation of the mind, and did we not smash  the political rule of the personality cult with its "two  absolutes" [observance of Mao's decision and obedience to his  directive]. All these are extremely important reforms of the  political structure. Without these reforms of the political  structure, the great reform in the structure of China's rural  economy could not have been realized.    Rural reform started with the institution of the system of  fixing farm output quotas for each household. This system,  outwardly, appears as a reform of the agricultural production of  the peasants, but in actual fact it was a reform of the rural  economic structure. Through a protracted, tireless struggle of  four, five years, it was finally possible to abolish the  people's commune system with its integration of government  administration and commune management, and its  worker-peasant-merchant-student-soldier unison. It was then only  that the 800 million peasants truly became masters of their  land, and that the 800 million peasants gained initial  democratic power. Democracy for 800 million peasants is an  extremely valuable contribution for the eventual establishment  of a democratic regime in China. The great significance of this  fact is not understood by many people and is ignored by many who  advocate democracy for China.    The reason for economic reform to have as consequence so  huge  an effect on political reform is that at the same time as the  economic reform was implemented a political struggle was waged  simultaneously, a struggle which breached certain conventional  political barriers. This was the only way that so great a  victory could have been achieved. For instance, when persisting  on implementing the system of fixed farm quotas for households,  it was necessary to offend against and violate the directives  and provisions on establishing the people's commune system, as  previously ordered by Mao Zedong and the CPC Central Committee.  It was furthermore necessary to offend against and violate  relevant provisions of the CPC Central Committee, such as  earlier documents that prescribed that "fixed farm output  quotas" would be permissible for "work teams," but not for  "households." Later documents changed this and allowed the  system to be applied to households, but only in the "three  hardship regions" (such poverty and hardship regions as the  national minority districts, remote mountainous districts on the  country's borders, and regions that had suffered calamities  which had reduced farm output). The system was not permitted for  the other vast rural areas. Later this was again changed,  allowing application in the villages, but not on state farms.  However, all these provisions were ultimately violated, and we  must therefore not mechanically separate reform of the economic  structure from the reform of the political structure. We must  not conduct economic reform isolated from simultaneous political  reform. This is a Chinese characteristic that has become  manifest in the actual life of China, and that is something that  man's will cannot alter. The positive significance of 800  million peasants gaining this much initial democratic freedom is  something that is difficult to comprehend. For instance,  peasants in some advanced districts with flourishing  agricultural production have begun to disbelieve and to break  away from the old set pattern of "take grain as the key link and  regard agriculture as the foundation," and are experimenting  with village and township enterprises. They are developing small  enterprises into large enterprises, and income from industrial  and sideline undertakings gradually overtake income from  agriculture. They, furthermore, use income from industrial and  sideline undertakings to help modernize agriculture, for  extensive improvements in agricultural products, and also to  achieve high and stable yields over long periods of time. The  extensive development of village and township enterprises in the  rural areas has not only increased peasant incomes and improved  the rural economy, but also opened the way for agricultural  modernization, urbanization of the rural areas, solving the  problem of surplus manpower--in excess of 100 million--in the  rural areas, and to narrow the disparity between city and  countryside. All these enormous and amazing changes nobody would  have ever expected. In August, year before last, I toured the  Suzhou-Wuxi-Changzhou triangle, and I was extremely pleased and  surprised by conditions there. In that area, many village and  township enterprises were of a larger scale than state  enterprises, their machinery and equipment was more advanced  than in the state enterprises, their management was more  rational than in the state enterprises, their productivity was  higher than in the state enterprises, and they turned in more  taxes and profits than state enterprises. There are now many,  many villages whose output value exceeds the 100 million yuan  mark.    In short, the reform of the rural economic structure has  abolished the people's commune system, and 800 million peasants  have gained initial democracy. This is an amazing change in  China. It is an enormous victory achieved by the high pressures  of a top-to-bottom directed assault against the "Leftist"  political forces.    After victory in the economic structural reform in the rural  areas, the next reform target was the system of the highly  centralized planned economy. Abolishing the people's commune  system took four years, while abolishing the planned economy  system has taken ten years. There was first the need to overcome  the unitary economic component of the public ownership system:  First, to revive the private economy that had been extinct for  over 30 years; second, to convert what nominally had been a  collective ownership system, but actually a system of ownership  by the whole people, truly into a collective economy of large,  medium and small types, especially to restore the various  service trades, such as commerce, and transportation, that are  so closely linked with the life of the people. After privately  managed or collectively managed enterprises had developed, a new  force broke in on the scene: foreign-invested enterprises, that  is, Sino-foreign joint ventures, Sino-foreign contractual joint  ventures, and wholly foreign-owned enterprises, and this  development opened up a wide breach in the centralized system of  the planned economy structure.  <H5>  "Foreign-Invested Enterprises" Opened Breach in Planned </H5> Economy    Development of foreign-invested enterprises took off only  after the establishment of the special economic zones [SEZs].  Establishment of the Shenzhen SEZ was a final resolution in  1980. The plan at that time was to establish a special zone on  the country's border, emulate the Hong Kong model, attract  foreign capital, and to open a window that would allow to study  foreign experiences on mainland territory, and thus set up a  small experimental station for the practice of market economy.  However, unexpectedly it developed into a miracle, and results  were excellent. Finally SEZs were also established at Zhuhai,  Shantou, and Xiamen, and later the whole of Hainan Island was  designated one large special zone. Later, economic development  zones were set up along the coast, foreign capital kept flowing  in, and the foreign-invested enterprises kept increasing.  China's economy became increasingly invigorated.    The SEZs mainly adhered to the law of market economy, and  they thereby dealt the planned economy structure a serious blow.  In the SEZs many conventional provisions of the planned economy  system were quite naturally tossed aside.    That the planned economy system was changed into a market  economy system was not only a great reform in economic respects,  but also in political respects. In the past it had been the  government (actually the party) that had decided everything,  directed everything, controlled everything, concerned itself  with everything. People's work, employment, school attendance,  salary and wages, welfare, food, clothing, housing, marriage,  childbirth, moving home, and business trips; everything was  strictly controlled. After abandoning the highly-centralized  planned economy structure, people became gradually liberated  from all these controls and restraints. As the people gained an  enhanced feeling of being masters of their own affairs,  democratic awareness increased. This is a point that is very  often ignored. Again from the economic angle, this is also a  great reform, because in this way, great changes will also come  about in the relations between the central and the local  authorities and in the relations between the government and the  enterprises. The former rigid system of having people, finance,  materials, production, supply, and marketing highly centralized  and unified had inevitably to undergo fundamental changes. At  long last a way had been found to revitalize the large and  medium-sized state enterprises and to break down the rigidity of  the former state of affairs, and it is now a matter of  implementing and making it become reality. The large and  medium-sized enterprises will finally be revitalized, that is  quite certain, and the prospects also justify optimism.  <H5>  Power Monopoly Leads to Various Malpractices </H5>   However, we must also realize that China's problems are  problems that have come down to us after having accumulated over  an extended period of the country's history. They are not  problems that have accumulated only during the 40-odd years of  total proletarian dictatorship, still these problems are indeed  extremely complex and extremely serious. If one were only to  look at this serious state of affairs without considering its  historical development, especially without fully assessing the  achievements gained by the Chinese people in their persistent  and dauntless upward struggle, and the particular developmental  direction determined by the strength of this people, one could  then easily regard the problems as excessively serious and come  to negative and pessimistic conclusions.    Talking now about the serious circumstances that presently  exist in China: The highly centralized system of planned economy  of the past few decades had resulted in an autocratic political  system with a highly centralized power monopoly. Following the  collapse of the planned economy system, this autocratic system  with its power monopoly, although also badly shaken, was still  able to maintain its position with extreme tenacity. The  strongest power had also been the strongest corrosive agent.  Under this system of a highly centralized power monopoly, larger  or smaller power-holders and larger and smaller organs of power,  are misusing their powers to engage in malpractices for selfish  ends to an extent that is hard to imagine. For instance, most  startling way of getting rich without own capital is to rely on  the domain of one's superior official, appropriate property to  oneself, and to engage in real estate trading.    For instance, an organization with certain power will  suddenly change its identity and become some kind of  corporation, a general company, while still, as before, keep  rigidly controlling the state-run enterprise, and as before  enjoying the high profits of the enterprise. They will then  still control important materials, such as steel, or significant  products, such as arms and ammunition, and one transaction in  such materials will yield profits into the millions. There is  also misuse of special powers to effect power-backed investments  and take out power-backed loans ("friendship" loans). These  cases are frequent and show no decline, rather a tendency to  increase, and are important reasons for excessive investments  and currency inflation. Under the protection of larger and  smaller powerholders, there is much tax fraud and tax evasion,  much lavish feasting, travelling at public expense, and  increases in collective expenditure. Repeated countermeasures,  but repeated offenses, attempts at control but never an  effective stop.    Utilizing the manufacture by larger or smaller powerholders  and under their protection, false and inferior products are  flooding the market. In the case of some consumer goods that are  daily necessities, 70 to 80 percent are false or inferior  products, inflicting great harm on the people.    There is also the extremely serious problem of such crimes  as  robbery, train banditry, illegal usurpation of highways, drug  trafficking, smuggling, trade in human beings, crimes which  continue to be rampant, and which are committed by criminal  gangs in collusion with powerholders. As to crimes committed by  higher ups and emulated by the lower ranks, such as graft and  bribery, malpractices for selfish ends, extortion and blackmail,  and even paying bribes to obtain official posts, such crimes too  are prevalent throughout society. They add to the ever growing  burden on the people, and their burden on the peasants is  particularly serious.    Yet another extremely frightening phenomenon is the really  alarming decadence of the press. The Chinese press is the area  most strictly controlled by those leftist princelings and  leftist big chiefs. While they loudly proclaim such slogans as  "oppose bourgeois liberalization" and "oppose peaceful  evolution," moral degeneration is spreading among them in a bad  way. In the very own party paper of the Central Committee, the  RENMIN RIBAO, the situation is also extremely serious. There are  many jingles about this on the mainland, a recent specimen goes  like this:    First reporter sells "secret information".    Second reporter gambles in shares.    Third reporter sells whole page layouts.    Fourth reporter canvasses advertisements.    Fifth reporter fishes for envelopes containing gratuities.    Sixth reporter is moonlighting by writing for other places  than his own paper.    It is impossible to list all the serious problems one by  one.  The details of many alarming incidents are first "exported" and  then become "marketed" domestically; the outside gets to know  them faster and to know more of them than the inside.    The chief root of the affliction in this serious state of  affairs is the autocratic system with its highly centralized  power monopoly. The problem cannot be remedied by treating  single symptoms piecemeal and not the whole disease. In economic  respects, going the old road of pressuring, adjusting, and  rectifying will not do anymore, and in political respects,  issuing of directives, launching formalistic investigative  movements will also not do anymore. What is necessary is to  conduct a resolute reform of the political structure  concurrently with the reform of the economic structure; what has  to be done is to firmly resolve to fundamentally reform this  autocratic system.  <H5>  Government System Requires Fundamental Reform </H5>   The broad masses of the people have reached the limits of  their endurance. Reference to last year's openly visible  disturbance in Shenzhen about the sale of shares, the  anti-tyranny struggle of the Renshou peasants, and the huge  fraud case involving the Changcheng Corporation, can well  explain the seriousness of the situation. It will also explain  that the people have reached a stage when they will be forced to  wage struggle, it will also explain that some relatively good  results have already been achieved, and will also explain that  the upward struggle of the masses is expanding in breadth and in  depth.    Of course, it is hoped that the urgent upward struggle will  be coordinated and receive support, from top toward the bottom,  by the CPC and the government. It is hoped that with coordinated  action from the top toward the bottom a fundamental reform of  the political structure will indeed be accomplished.    People who advocate economic reform alone and oppose  political reform say that they are emulating Singapore, and that  they highly esteem the example set by Singapore. However, they  do not understand that the reason why Singapore has been doing  so well is that the Singapore Government does not directly  control economic affairs. Besides, the Singapore Government is  an absolutely honest government, also a government that operates  with a proficient yet suitably limited personnel, a government  of the rule of law, a government performing at high efficiency,  and a government that has the welfare of its people at heart. If  we are to truly emulate Singapore, then we should as quickly as  possible get on with the reform of the political system. We  should then, first of all, start with the reform of the  government system. The government that we must subject to change  is one that is highly centralized, that determines everything,  directs everything, controls everything, concerns itself with  everything, a government with an unwieldy organization, with  bloated agencies, with overstaffed offices, affected by  routinism and bureaucratism. This government has to be changed  into one that is honest, that employs proficient yet suitably  limited personnel, that is operating according to the rule of  law, that is efficient and welfare-conscious. This is the reform  of the government system that is presently absolutely needed  with regard to every one of the above-mentioned characteristics;  it is a reform that also cannot be delayed any longer.    Think, if a reform of this sort could be implemented, and if  it were possible to gradually establish a government like  Singapore's, there would indeed be every hope that the many  serious problems that we are presently having could all be  resolved.    China's affairs are extremely complex, all good ideals and  good aspirations must be gradually realized on the basis of the  actual conditions. Otherwise, haste will not get you to your  goal and good intentions will not get good results, as so often  happened. It is my opinion that with realistic and sustained  effort, China's prospects are definitely bright.  <H5>  "Peaceful Gradual Advance" Will Benefit China's Development </H5>   Summing up all that was said, we may gain valuable  experiences and lessons, namely:    1) Economic reform must be conducted simultaneously with  political reform; 2) Whatever the obstructing forces, the  Chinese people have always found ways and means to wage their  struggle, a struggle from the bottom upward; 3) China's  reform must always be a continuous effort to smash the    conventions of the "Leftist" forces; 4) The struggle is a  protracted one. Only by pursuing it realistically, persistently,  and untiringly, will there come a time when the enormous change  will have been achieved, namely the change from quantitative  changes to the change in substance.    Xu Jiatun put forward the idea of "peaceful evolution," my  idea is "peaceful gradual advance." The great difference is that  Xu speaks of socialism and capitalism progressing together in a  "peaceful evolution," to gradually heading for a world of  universal harmony. My idea of "peaceful gradual advance" speaks  only of the future political situation within China, and asserts  that peaceful methods should be used in a gradual advance.    I emphasize "peaceful" because innumerable historical events  have proven that violence and democracy are as incompatible as  fire and water. If violence is used to topple a violent regime,  the new regime is bound to use violence to maintain its rule,  and however democratic its pronouncements, in reality it cannot  possibly be a democratic regime. It would only be replacing one  violent regime with another violent regime.    I emphasize "peaceful," because in so large a country as  China the political situation is extremely complex, and the  influence of autocracy lingers on, as a left-over from several  thousand years of history. It is therefore impossible to effect  a "great leap forward" and to "advance at the double," also  impossible to "overtake England and the United States" within a  short period of time, or to cross all of a sudden over a "golden  bridge" right into "paradise." Only by realistic and persistent  effort will it be possible to achieve an emphatically peaceful,  stable, protracted, and gradual advance.    At the same time I very much disagree with those who  advocate  "strike down the communist party, overthrow the Chinese  Government." That way is fraught with great danger, a way one  should not take. I believe that by the methods of "striking  down" and "overthrowing" it is not possible to achieve a truly  democratic society, it could only replace violence by violence.  For this reason I emphasize: I am not a man of democracy in  general, but of peaceful democracy. I propose to urge the  communist party to effect self-reform, urge the communist party  to effect a democratic reform within the party. In the China of  today, it is impossible to have a reform of the Chinese society  without a reform of the CPC, and without internal democracy  within the CPC, it is impossible to have democracy in Chinese  society and democracy in the state.    In my opinion only by adopting the method of "peaceful  gradual advance" will it be possible to achieve a prosperous and  thriving China. I believe there are indeed powerful reform  forces and democratic forces generally extent within the CPC,  forces that would exert a top-to-bottom effort. Although the  Chinese people have lost much confidence in the CPC, they have  not given up all hope. They are still very hopeful, and they  still hope that their untiring upward struggle will be met with  a coordinated downward effort by the party and the government,  so that even greater achievements will be unceasingly  accomplished in China's reform.    This is how I assess the direction of China's development,  and these are also the reasons for my optimistic attitude.</p>

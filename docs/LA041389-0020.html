			<p><P> April 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> The Motion Picture Assn. of America's ratings board has lifted an X rating and  assigned an R to "Scandal," the Miramax film about the 1963 Profumo sex affair  that rocked the British government. After losing an appeal last week to have  the rating changed, the producers submitted a re-edited version of an orgy  scene responsible for the X rating. Most theater chains refuse to exhibit  X-rated films and some newspapers will not accept their advertisements. A  spokeswoman for Miramax said the orgy scene still runs the same length and no  sex acts in the original version have been omitted.ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

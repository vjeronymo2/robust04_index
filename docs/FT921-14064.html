			<p>920117 FT  17 JAN 92 / Holmes a Court villa on market for Pounds 17.5m A LISTED Regency villa in Regent's Park, London, has been put up for sale for Pounds 17.5m following the death of Mr Robert Holmes a Court, the Australian financier, 18 months ago, Vanessa Houlder writes. The 12,300 sq ft Grade 1 listed building, built in 1824 by Decimus Burton, has four acres of private parkland. Mr Holmes a Court bought the villa in 1986 for Pounds 8m, spent two years renovating it and used it as a base for his international investment operations. Knight Frank &amp; Rutley, the agents, said Mrs Janet Holmes a Court is selling the building because she spends less time in London than did her husband. Property market, Page 12</p>

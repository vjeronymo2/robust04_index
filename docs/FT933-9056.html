			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / Timex brings forward Dundee plant closure TIMEX IS planning to close its troubled printed circuit board plant in Dundee within weeks, several months earlier than expected, the company said yesterday. But the closure of the factory, after 47 years of operation, looks unlikely to end one of Britain's longest and most bitter industrial disputes for many years, as strike leaders vowed to step up a boy-cott of Timex products in continental Europe and North America. 'The company's decision to shut the plant reflects the success of our world-wide campaign against them,' said Mr Charlie Malone, Timex strike committee chairman. 'We don't intend to end it until the name of Timex is tarnished.' The strikers will meet today to discuss their next moves. Timex management announced two months ago its intention to stop production in Dundee by the end of the year after workers rejected a peace formula to resolve the eight-month-old strike which followed their mass dismissal for refusing to accept cuts in their terms and conditions of employment. The strike was accompanied by large demonstrations in Dundee, with occasional violent scenes outside the plant. The company has decided to bring forward the date of the plant's closure and yesterday 93 workers who replaced the strikers received their redundancy notices. Timex said the remaining 170 replacement workers and 97 clerical and managerial staff would also go as soon as Timex's business customers have found alternative suppliers for printed circuit boards. The AEEU engineering and electrical union is unlikely to continue recognising the dispute and paying the strikers Pounds 30 a week once the plant is shut, although national officials want to ensure that Timex honours legal obligations over the pension fund for its ex-employees. The strike committee's fund-raising efforts in Britain and elsewhere are said to have produced about Pounds 200,000. Over the past four weeks a delegation has been travelling around the US, building support to confront Timex through a boycott of its products. Contact has also been made with unions in Mexico, the Philippines and France where Timex continues to have production plants. A number of US unions including communication workers, steel workers, miners and machinists have mobilised backing for the Timex strikers. The AFL-CIO union federation in Washington is hoping the strike committee will be able to give evidence to a congressional committee on its experiences to support the striker replacement bill which US unions hope will secure congressional approval this autumn. That measure is designed to make it unlawful for a US employer to sack all its workers if they go on strike. Mr Malone also said a legal action against Timex in the US courts was being discussed under the 1988 Omnibus Trade Act, which prevents US companies discriminating against workers in their overseas plants.</p>

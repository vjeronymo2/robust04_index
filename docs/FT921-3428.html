			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Overseas acquisitions and diversification lift Kerry KERRY GROUP, the Irish dairy and food products manufacturer, yesterday reported a 25 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to IPounds 24.1m (Pounds 22.5m) for 1991, on turnover up from IPounds 584m to IPounds 755m. Earnings per share increased by 15 per cent to 14.5p and a final dividend of 1.4p (1.39p) is recommended for a total of 2.15p (2.1p). The results have fulfilled market expectations of Kerry's long-term growth prospects resulting from its aggressive overseas acquisition programme and diversification into meat processing. Meat processing now accounts for IPounds 372m, or 49 per cent, of turnover, dairy products and food ingredients IPounds 353m (47 per cent) while its agricultural division contributed IPounds 30m. On a geographical basis the turnover breakdown is: Ireland 36 per cent, UK and mainland Europe 38 per cent, and the US 25 per cent. For the first time, meat processing has become the group's main activity, and Ireland has ceased to be its principal market. Based on turnover Kerry is now one of Ireland's top ten companies. Most of the increased turnover comes from Kerry's acquisition of five meat processing plants in the UK and Ireland in the past year, together with their distribution networks, and the purchase of Dairyland Products, a food ingredient manufacturer in the US. Kerry said it planned to follow up its success in the US food ingredients market 'with a thrust into the European market'. Kerry has spent IPounds 66m on acquisitions in the past 15 months. In May 1991 a placing of 6m shares raised IPounds 10.8m.</p>

			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Redland to attack Steetley values REDLAND, the building materials group, is to sharpen its attack on Steetley, the target of its Pounds 626m hostile bid, following the collapse of joint venture talks between Steetley and Tarmac last week and the resignation of its prey's broker, Cazenove. In particular Redland will focus on asset valuations and will claim that Steetley's acquisition of Gobitta for Pounds 92m in 1990 overvalued the private French aggregates company. The attack is aimed to pre-empt Steetley's defence document, which is due late this week once the Office of Fair Trading has accepted Redland's undertakings on the disposals of plant in areas where it would have a dominant position after a successful bid. Mr Gerald Corbett, finance director at Redland, said that while some of Steetley's UK assets could be revalued, as they had not been adjusted since 1984, the French assets may be worth less than book value. Gobitta has 150m tonnes of sand, gravel and limestone reserves, but permission to extract only 40m of this had been received. Furthermore some of the limestone reserves appeared contaminated and Steetley did not appear to be going ahead with extraction on some permitted sites, Mr Corbett said. At the time of the Gobitta acquisition, analysts in the UK were not told that only 40m of the 150m tonnes had received consent for extraction, as a result of what a Steetley adviser called 'an error of translation' from the French contract by an eminent City firm of solicitors. The adviser said Steetley had only made part of the payment to Gobitta. He would not be drawn on speculation about the group's asset values but said that Redland was only able to judge the French sites by 'looking at them over the fence.' After the Monopolies and Mergers Commission's decision to refer the Tarmac joint venture last week - a decision which triggered the collapse of the joint venture - Steetley still had the finest and lowest cost brick producing company in the country, the adviser said.</p>

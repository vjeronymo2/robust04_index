			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Waste Management Waste Management International has had a rollercoaster ride since 20 per cent of its shares were offered for sale in April last year. Having under-performed the market by 30 per cent in that period, the shares now stand a shade below the offer price. Third-quarter figures are unlikely to dispel lingering doubts. Delay in gaining government approvals for landfill sites in Italy is the main reason for disappointment. Even assuming that WMI can find a way through the Italian labyrinth, the episode underlines the scope for political interference. Stripping out construction profits which boosted the bottom line last year, the waste business is still growing at around 25 per cent a year. The group's prodigious acquisitions programme - 34 deals completed so far this year - underpins this rate of progress. Earnings momentum depends on WMI's ability to digest enough prey without swallowing a dud. Gearing does not look especially high, at least under the US accounting rules the company prefers. The snag is that amortising acquired goodwill through the profit and loss account in the US manner - rather than writing it off to reserves - shows earnings per share are no higher than this time last year. With almost 70 per cent of the free float now held in the US, up from 45 per cent at the time of flotation, that is of more than academic interest. The long-term arguments in favour of waste management remain convincing, but WMI will struggle to regain a premium rating.</p>

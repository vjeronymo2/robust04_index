			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk paid a  working visit to the town of Pervomaysk, Mykolayiv Oblast. Our  correspondent Vitaliy Naumenko reports:    [Begin recording] [Naumenko] Given the heavy load of  problems  now facing the Ukrainian people which call for the soonest  possible resolution, the Ukrainian president received quite a  few questions.    [Unidentified correspondent from Ukrayinske Radio] I would  not like to talk about other issues on this festive day, but  obviously, the Crimean issue is on everybody's mind today. How  would you comment on the further course of developments?    [Kravchuk] Once the Crimean Supreme Soviet rescinds the law  that it passed, the Ukrainian Supreme Council's resolution will  also be revoked. In other words, everything depends on the  Crimean Supreme Soviet. If it suspends its law, the  corresponding resolution by the Ukrainian Supreme Council will  also be suspended. I hope that the delegation named by the  Crimean Supreme Soviet will arrive in Kiev soon, and that we  will find some solution to the issue. But this solution can  only have one outcome: No changes as far as [Crimea's] status or  Ukrainian territorial integrity are concerned -- and in the  framework of this process, as they say, is the process of  finding mutual understanding, without changing status or  territorial integrity. If this is accepted as the basis, we  will find solutions. However, integrity and statehood are the  limit, beyond which there is no turning back. No one is allowed  to cross it. Nor will the Crimea be allowed to cross it.    [Unidentified correspondent] Do you not think that the  Crimean parliament has gone too far in its claims regarding  Ukraine's territorial integrity?    [Kravchuk] I think they will end where they began. Because  this will be a mandatory legal action by Ukraine -- and  supported not only by Ukraine. I have information that an  address by the Ukrainian foreign minister to world countries,  providing an explanation of our position.... This position has  met with comprehensive support for the territorial integrity  and inviolability of Ukrainian borders. The whole world  recognized Ukraine, and it also recognizes our legal position.  Incidentally, this was confirmed by Russian Foreign Minister  Kozyrev, who said that Russia cannot, and will not, bring up the  issue of territorial integrity. It stands to reason that it  cannot do so because this is recognized by the whole world.  This was contained in the agreement between Russia and Ukraine  in 1990 and in the trilateral agreement signed by the presidents  of Ukraine, the United States, and Russia in Moscow. [passage  omitted]    [Unidentified correspondent, in Russian] What is your stance  on the presidential elections?    [Kravchuk, in Russian] It remains the same. While talking  with the Mykolayiv Oblast leadership today, I convinced myself  once again that one has to resolve today issues facing Ukraine  and its people. Both the political and economic situation are  complicated. Most important is that before holding elections,  one needs to lay the legal groundwork for power, which should be  constitutional, law-governed, and well grounded. And only then  should elections be held -- so that there will be no situation  of the legalities being established after the elections. By the  way, the Crimea is a shining example proving this point. It was  granted autonomy in 1990, and we adopted the power-sharing law  two years later. As a result, the legal vacuum was being filled  in the meantime, leading to the buildup of legal, political, and  other problems. They can only be resolved when we move back to  the starting point. We should seek to prevent a similar  situation in this election, when you elect and then decide. It  is always more difficult. This is why one needs to decide  everything, dot all i's, and then conduct elections. [end  recording]</p>

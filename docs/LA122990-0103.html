Tim Newman said the same man has apparently committed six flashings  beginning in October, from 2 to 7 p.m. The most recent incident was Monday.  </P> <P> "In some cases, the suspect runs alongside of the victims and exposes himself,"  Newman said. "In others, he approaches them from brush along the road."  </P> <P> The suspect was described as about 5 feet, 9 inches and 170 to 200 pounds, with  dirty blond hair cut short but protruding slightly over the ears. He has a  "protruding and extremely white stomach," police said. The flasher sometimes  has worn sunglasses.  </P> <P> Police Detective Ed Walsh is seeking information at (714) 644-3773.

			<p><P> October 16, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROPOSITION 136  </P> <P> In his column about the overuse of bonds by state government (Opinion, Oct. 7),  Cary Lowe incorrectly states Proposition 136, which I authored, requires a  two-thirds vote for new taxes. In fact, Proposition 136 requires a simple  majority vote if the taxes go into the general fund where spending can be  prioritized.  </P> <P> The two-thirds requirement applies only to "special taxes," those taxes which  are permanently locked in for special purposes.  </P> <P> Lowe also misses the mark when he argues that general obligation bonds should  receive a majority vote for passage. The two-thirds vote requirement for  passage of local general obligation bonds -- a requirement that predates  Proposition 13 -- is an important protection for taxpayers. These bonds are  backed by property taxes, that is, people's homes. Further, under the  rent-control laws of Los Angeles, tax increases to cover bonds cannot be passed  on to renters. Therefore, Lowe is mistaken when he says the costs of local  general obligation bonds are shared by the whole community.  </P> <P> JOEL FOX, President  </P> <P> Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn.  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

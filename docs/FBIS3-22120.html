The statement followed a report, "Russia: dust heap of  Western waste", which was issued by the Greenpeace organization  late in 1993. The report impelled some media to similar  publications.    According to the report, 96 attempts have been made in the  last six years to supply to Russia 34 million tons of waste.  The statement notes that the cited data testifies only to  intentions and is not an accomplished fact really threatening  Russia's ecological security. According to the Russian Ministry  of Environmental Protection, local environmental protection  bodies have rejected the overwhelming majority of Western  proposals following expert conclusions.</p>

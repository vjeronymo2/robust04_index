			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / World Commodities Prices: Wool CRISIS CONDITIONS in the wool market were underlined this week when the Australian Wool Corporation's market indicator continued its steady fall, beyond the low point reached when free market trade was first resumed in February 1991. In real terms these are the lowest prices ever recorded. Weak markets enhance the effects of recession and the indefinite absence of the old Soviet Union countries. A prominent leader in the French wool textile industry and director of the International Wool Secretariat has outspokenly suggested that the stockpile in Australia should be destroyed, as the only way to allow prices to rise.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Police Colonels Miguel Angel Vasquez and </F> Carlos Trujillo by an unidentified reporter in Quito on 3  February; from the "Informative Antenna" newscast--live or  recorded]    [Text] [Reporter] We are here with Colonel Miguel Angel  Vasquez [words indistinct] We would like to know the details of  how the strike decreed by the United Workers Front [FUT] has  progressed.    [Vasquez] I can give you an up-to-the-minute evaluation of  how the strike is progressing. Regarding the police actions, we  may say that everything is under control. The roads have been  cleared, including the Panamerican Highway.    The five provinces comprising the third district, such as  Azuay, Loja, Canar, Zamora, and Morona, are also clear;  consequently, commercial and administrative activities in those  provinces are being carried out normally. There are  demonstrations and street protests, which have been definitely  brought under control.    Police are carrying out a very specific task of prevention,  avoiding direct contact with demonstrators, who sometimes become  aggressive. To avoid additional problems, the police are taking  precautions to avoid confrontations.    [Reporter] [Words indistinct] reports that police have  attacked a youth; this has caused resentment from [words  indistinct] citizens. What is the police version of this case?    [Vasquez] I think citizens and the media are well aware of  our duty. If one of these demonstrators attack and hurl Molotov  cocktails at policemen, the police must react. We cannot let  ourselves be attacked physically. We were forced to act, but  this youngster was never treated with brutality. He was simply  overpowered and arrested and was submitted to authorities.    We are examining our policemen's injuries to report them to  the media. Medical examinations are being taken now.    [Reporter] What happened to General [words indistinct]  developed the strike decreed by the FUT in this city. Colonel  Carlos Trujillo is also here. He will analyze [words  indistinct] regarding police measures.    [Trujillo] We will continue to implement the same provisions  issued by the General Command and the [words indistinct]. Our  police duty will be to prevent crimes. We hope citizens  understand what are our duty and responsibility. We did not  come out to hurt anyone. We must be viewed as representatives  of public order and peace. We will come out and exercise  control over the city and demonstrations. We will not move  against demonstrators as long as they do not attack other  individuals or public and private property.</p>

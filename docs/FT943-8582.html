			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Dealing profits hit HSBC The sharp fall in dealing profits at international banking group HSBC Holdings took the market by surprise, sending the shares tumbling, after it reported favourable interim figures. Headline profits up 24 per cent at Pounds 1.46bn were better than anticipated, but it was the fall in profits from treasury and capital market operations at subsidiaries Midland Bank and HongKong Bank that raised most concern. Analysts were also disappointed by the big rise in the tax charge. The shares fell back sharply and were down 20 at the day's worst before recovering to end 10 off at 749p, as sentiment shifted its focus to the lower than expected bad debt provisions. Volume stood at 6.9m shares at the close. Several brokers said that they would be upgrading full-year profit expectations. That list includes Mr Simon Samuels at Smith New Court who indicated that his current forecast of Pounds 2.8bn will be raised to around Pounds 3.1bn. However, he remains cautious on the stock and said: 'The concerns raised by the poor quality of earnings in 1993 was further highlighted by these figures. I feel the shares are fully priced at these levels. Hong Kong investors will be concerned about the significantly higher tax charge.'</p>

			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / TUC aims to cut jobs in radical relaunch The Trades Union Congress will today unveil a proposal to revolutionise the internal workings of the TUC as part of a 'relaunch' of the organisation involving job cuts and scrapping committees. The relaunch planned for next March, is likely to distance it further from the Labour party and to stress the TUC's role as a hard-nosed lobbying group on work-related issues. TUC officials admit that its membership total is likely to be hit hard by government-imposed reforms later this year to the 'check-off' system of paying union dues. Part of the internal reform, which will be presented today to the TUC's Finance and General Purposes Committee, involves abolishing a large number of the TUC's 25 committees, most of which are poorly attended and soak up resources to little effect. Some of the main General Council committees will probably stay but the seven industry committees are likely to be axed. Any spare resources will be transferred to the lobbying and campaigning unit. The organisation has little choice but to slim down. Its current income of Pounds 10m, based on the Pounds 1.40 a year paid on behalf of 7m TUC-affiliated union members, pays for nearly 200 employees at Congress House, in the regions and in its education arm, but is set for steady decline. Officials admit that the real membership of TUC unions is has already nearer to 6m than the 7m-plus the organisation quotes, with no levelling-off in sight. They expect to lose another 10 per cent as a result of the move to make the 80 per cent who pay union dues by automatic check-off renew their consent to the system before next August. Another financial blow is the removal of government support from some aspects of trade union education, which together with falling income from affiliated unions could mean a further round of job cuts at the TUC after last year's belated 20 per cent cut. Despite this gloomy financial backdrop to the relaunch, Mr John Monks - who yesterday celebrated his 100th day as TUC general-secretary - is widely considered to have made an impressive start to his leadership. He is becoming an impressive media performer, highlighting the growth of employment insecurity and its possible role in undermining family values. Mr Monks has a friendly relationship with Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary, who is keen to give the TUC a constructive role in some areas of public policy, especially training. Mr Hunt also wants to see union representatives on all Training and Enterprise Councils. However, the relaunch could be dogged by two reminders of a more traditional kind of trade unionism - a long-standing inter-union wrangle in the construction industry, and a planned one-day public-sector 'general strike' in April.</p>

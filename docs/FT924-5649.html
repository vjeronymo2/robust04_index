			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / Bolivia has worst rural poverty BOLIVIA has 97 per cent of its rural population living below the poverty line, the highest percentage in the world, according to a report by the International Fund for Agricultural Development, a United Nations agency, writes Chris Philipsborn in La Paz. The report is a blow to successive Bolivian governments, which since 1985 have embraced painful economic restructuring on the premise that benefits would eventually trickle down. The report says rural poverty has grown since 1965, when only 85 per cent lived below the poverty line. At the same time, Bolivia's rural population increased by 1.4m, to 3.4m, or more than half of the total population. The report blamed the increase in poverty on population growth unmatched by increases in agricultural productivity. 'There have been some attempts at redistribution of land. However, the majority of Bolivian farmers still work very small plots . . . without direct investment from the state,' said Mr Mohiuddin Alamgir, a co-author of the report. Mr Alamgir believes the situation will worsen unless there is direct policy intervention from government.</p>

			<p><P> June 29, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LAB SHUT FOR MISDIAGNOSES ALSO SERVED OUT-OF-STATE CLIENTS;  </P> <P> NATIONWIDE ALERT PLANNED FOR PAP SMEAR TESTS  </P> <P> California health officials said Tuesday that they will issue an advisory to  warn health officers nationwide that a Tarzana medical laboratory accused of  misdiagnosing medical tests may have done business in their states.  </P> <P> Department of Health Services spokesman Norm Hartman said the advisory will  warn that the laboratory, Central Pathology Services Medical Group,  misdiagnosed 21% of a random selection of Pap smear tests and was shut down in  April. He said the notice will be issued through the National Public Health  Information Coalition, which represents public health officers in 42 states.  </P> <P> "We want to alert everybody this is going on," Hartman said. He was unsure how  many states that the laboratory had served, but said he believed that it  handled tests from Washington, Indiana, Arizona and Illinois, among others.  </P> <P> "Quite a lot of business came from out of state," he said. "Thirty to 40% of  the obstetricians and gynecologists in Chicago were sending their business to  this lab."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Unaware of Role  </P> <P> Hartman said he is concerned that doctors in distant cities may be unaware of  what has happened in California, even though their patients' tests may have  been sent to Tarzana.  </P> <P> A spokesman for the lab, Martin Cooper, said it "is an inaccurate perception  that a significant amount of business out of this lab came from out of state."  He also said the lab's affiliate, Central Diagnostic Laboratory, is not doing  any Pap tests. Those tests are now being sent to Pennsylvania, he said.  </P> <P> Central Pathology processed about 2,600 Pap tests -- used to detect cervical  cancer -- each day. But after errors were detected by federal authorities early  this year, the lab first lost its authority to participate in Medi-Cal and  Medicare health insurance programs, then closed its doors under pressure from  the state.  </P> <P> The state sued Central Diagnostic and Central Pathology in May, along with four  other defendants, for $3 million and asked for a court order requiring the  firms to do free Pap tests for millions of women who it had screened during the  last five years.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sent Letters  </P> <P> Central Diagnostic responded by sending letters to 15,000 physicians advising  that the rescreening is available for patients who want it.  </P> <P> But Hartman said he is concerned that those letters may not go far enough. He  said Central Diagnostic reported the results of the tests performed by Central  Pathology. Doctors, therefore, might not be aware that the Pap smear they sent  out for analysis was reviewed by Central Pathology, Hartman said.  </P> <P> Cooper responded that the letters sent out by the lab do not hide Central  Pathology's role. "Their own attorney approved the letter," he said of state  health officials. "They would be wise to check that fact."  </P> <P> The advisory will be forwarded to the 41 other members of the coalition through  the federal Centers for Disease Control, based in Atlanta. Hartman said the  advisory is the first issue of concern to be addressed by the coalition since  it was formed earlier this year.  </P></p>

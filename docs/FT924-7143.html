			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Small businesses bitter at treatment by banks EACH owner of a small business who has gone to a manager at a Barclays Bank branch seeking a loan for the past decade has been given a Campari  - on paper rather than in a glass. The experience was generally pleasant in the heady days of the late 1980s. But as the recession has deepened, more of them have been left with a bitter taste. Campari is the acronym by which Barclays managers are trained to assess the risk of lending to small business. Depending on their estimate of factors such as the owner's character (the C in Campari), they set the interest on a loan at between 2 percentage points and 7 percentage points above base rate. Unless an owner chooses a fixed-rate loan - about 30 per cent of Barclays' small business loans are at a fixed rate - this will not be the last Campari he or she has. The risk that the bank attaches to the loan will be re-assessed at least each year, and the interest margin may change accordingly. Criticism of the way banks lend to small businesses this week has focused on the widening of the average margin. Barclays and National Westminster have both raised the average margin from 3.1 percentage points 18 months ago to 3.5 points today - the cumulative effect of thousands of Camparis. The way banks have practised risk assessment over the past year has provoked discontent among small businesses on two grounds. One is that assessment by local bank managers is viewed as opaque and arbitrary. The second is that more frequent assessments have often led to widening loan margins. The opacity of how decisions on loan margins are made is a concern of many small businesses. Mr Stan Mendham, founder of the Forum of Private Business, says banks tend to regard risk assessment as 'an art form'. He says businesses would not resent payments so much if they knew how they were set. In spite of the catchiness of acronymns such as Campari, the risk assessment policies of banks leave plenty of discretion to local managers. National Westminster says this has to be so because the average size of loan in its Pounds 11bn small-business portfolio is just Pounds 15,000. The bank provides two forms of support. One is training in applying business tests. The Campari acronym teaches managers to examine the owner's Character and Ability, the Purpose of the business, the Amount of the loan, the Repayment ability through cashflow, and the Insurance of loan collateral. Once he or she has decided on these factors, the final calculation is the loan Margin - the M in Campari. But Barclays encourages the use of discretion. 'If you make the process too scientific, you get bogged down,' said Mr David Lavarack, head of small-business services at Barclays. Indeed, the weight of the various factors has altered over time. Mr Lavarack argues that the loan collateral - which often came in the form of property in the late 1980s - was always considered less important than the character of the owners and their repayment ability. But Ms Jane Bradford, head of small-business services at National Westminster, says the recession has reinforced the importance of cashflow compared to property collateral. 'We try to price risk fully, and the recession has brought home that we did not always do it in the 1980s,' she says. The second form of reinforcement of managers' judgment is support from specialists in business-lending in regional offices. National Westminster asks local managers to call on support from teams of accountants and specialists in risk assessment at its 21 regional offices. Discontent about more frequent reassessments and widening of loan margins results from the recession. Barclays and National Westminster - the two largest lenders to small businesses with total loans of Pounds 24bn to 1.7m customers - both deny that widening margins have been created by head office fiat. However, it is clear that guidelines have affected both the mixtures for Camparis and their frequency. Ms Bradford says managers are responding to the economic climate, and the fact that small-business loans accounted for a large part of the bank's Pounds 1.4bn UK bad-loan provision last year. She emphasises that all businesses are given notice of loan margin changes, and there are few cases of rises in margins of more than 0.5 percentage points at a time. But she defends higher pricing. 'How long can we sustain these levels of loss without seeking an increase in margins?' she asks. Nonetheless, the banks are being forced to find ways of softening the blows to small businesses that margin widening represents. Mr Lavarack is sensitive to the notion that the decision-making is incomprehensible. 'Our managers are happy to talk over a Campari with anyone who wants,' he says.</p>

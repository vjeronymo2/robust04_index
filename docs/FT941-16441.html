			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / World Bond Markets: Tokyo Pessimism over economic recovery is expected to deepen as the bond market concentrates on the negotiations for political reform. That debate could further delay the economic support package. If the political reform bill fails to pass the upper house by Sunday - 60 days after the bill's passage in the lower house - the lower chamber obtains the right to form a joint committee with the upper house to enact amended versions. Expectation of a delay in the economic package is deepening the gloom, pushing the yield on the No 157 10-year benchmark lower. Some traders expect the yield, which closed below the 3 per cent mark last Friday for the first time in six years, to test the historical low of 2.55 per cent. Last week's recovery of the Tokyo stock market gives little incentive to place new funds into the bond market. Speculation of lower interest rates and an imminent cut in the official discount rate cut have been supported by weak share prices, but further buying of export-oriented shares due to the weaker yen could undermine such hopes. Short-term interest rates may rise slightly this week, the final week for the December reserve maintenance period. Banks are expected to dip into the money markets to raise funds for their accounts at the Bank of Japan.</p>

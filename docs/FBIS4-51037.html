			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Liu Yuanda (0491 6678 6671)] </F>   [Text] Kunming, 24 May (XINHUA) -- China's first nine  enterprises successfully placed their shares on markets outside  the mainland. Liu Hongru, a noted economist and chairman of the  China Securities Supervision and Administration Committee,  praised them as "file leaders" in our country's economic  restructuring.    A few days ago, the State Economic Restructuring Commission  and the China Securities Supervision and Administration  Committee sponsored a forum on experiences in placing shares in  outside-the- mainland markets at the Kunming Machine Tools  Company Ltd. More than 50 representatives from the nine  enterprises which had successfully placed their shares in  outside-the-mainland markets, relevant departments under the  State Council, the Shenzhen Securities Exchange, law firms, and  other units reviewed and discussed the work in this regard.    With the approval of the State Council, the Shanghai  Petrochemical Company, the Yizheng Chemical Fiber Company, the  Qingdao Beer Company, the Maanshan Iron and Steel Company, the  Kunming Machine Tools Company, the Guangdong Shipyard in  Guangzhou, the Dongfang Electric Motor Company, the (?Beijing  People's Machinery Company) [bei ren ji 0554 0086 2623], and  Tianjin's Bohai Company issued stocks outside the mainland last  year. Now Dongfang is still selling its stocks, and the other  eight companies have already raised a total of more than 10  billion Hong Kong dollars. Judging from subscriptions for its  shares outside the mainland, the Dongfang Electric Motor Company  is doing well in this regard. These companies have raised so  much money in such a short time. It is unprecedented in China.  This has not only solved the problems of funds for the nine  companies, but also opened a major channel for Chinese  enterprises to raise funds from the international market.    These nine enterprises are our country's "file leaders" in  connecting Chinese enterprises with the international market.  They have played an exemplary role in changing operating  mechanisms and bringing about profound changes in their  behavior. Of all the stock companies, the nine have done a  better job in changing their operating mechanisms. They have  changed from acting according to administrative directives to  acting according to laws and regulations and from focusing their  attention on the government to focusing their attention on the  market, especially the international market. They have sought a  better way for the state sector of the economy to adapt to the  market economy.</p>

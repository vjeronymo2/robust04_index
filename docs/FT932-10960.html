			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Holmes Protection chief executive stands down MR ERIC Kohn, the investor who led the dissident shareholder group which seized control of Holmes Protection Group 18 months ago, has resigned as chief executive and vice chairman of the US-based, but London-listed security concern. Mr Kohn will remain on the board. He felt the restructuring of the group had been 'substantially completed,' and said he was resigning for personal reasons to devote time to his other business interests, which include being chairman of Barons Financial Services (UK). He had always intended to step down once the company had achieved a turnround and was 'moving forward' again. He emphasised that there was 'nothing sinister' in his decision. Earlier this year, Holmes announced that, following the successful completion of a debt restructuring programme, pre-tax profits for 1992 totalled Dollars 4.17m (Pounds 2.7m), compared with losses of Dollars 35.5m, on turnover down from Dollars 59m to Dollars 56.2m. The board, headed by Sir Ian MacGregor, once chairman of British Steel and British Coal, has appointed Mr Richard Hickson, formerly chief operating officer, as chief executive and president. Separately, Holmes announced that it had terminated the lease on its offices at Lake Success, New York. The company had previously provided Dollars 1.65m for the lease, and will record a gain of Dollars 920,000 after agreeing a termination payment of Dollars 730,000.</p>

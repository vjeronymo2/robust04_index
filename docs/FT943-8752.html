			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / Hopes revive of Japanese compensating war victims Japan aims to 'address issues which remain unresolved since the war,' Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama said yesterday. His statement revives hopes in Asia that Japan will provide financial compensation for victims (or their descendants) in territory occupied before 1945. At a ceremony in Tokyo on the 49th anniversary of Japan's surrender to the allies, Mr Murayama did not elaborate on the unresolved issues but went slightly further than his predecessors in atoning for the actions of the imperial army. The prime minister spoke of 'tragic sacrifices beyond description' inflicted on a large number of people in Asia and elsewhere. He offered 'heartfelt condolences to them with a deep repentance'. Officials said Mr Murayama, aged 70 and a life-long socialist and pacifist, had chosen the remorseful phrases himself to insert into a prepared speech. A year ago, the then premier, Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, raised hopes of financial redress after acknowledging the forces' misdeeds. Japan insists the issue of reparations was resolved in the San Francisco peace treaty with the US, but the possibility of setting up a substantial fund to provide benefits over 10 years is said to be under discussion ahead of the 50th anniversary next year. Japanese are suspected in Asia of insufficiently recognising the consequences of their country's wartime aggression and mourning only their own 3m war dead, the actual purpose of yesterday's government-sponsored service. A separate and more controversial gathering at the Yasukuni Shrine, where war criminals are among those commemorated, drew seven cabinet ministers, despite a request from Mr Murayama that they stay away. Six of the ministers were from the Liberal Democratic party and one from the New Harbinger party, partners of Mr Murayama's Social Democratic party in the six-week-old coalition. On Sunday, an LDP minister resigned after suggesting the Japanese occupation benefited parts of Asia, bringing independence from European powers, an increased literacy rate and resultant economic success. Mr Shin Sakurai was replaced as head of the Environment Agency by Mr Sohei Miyashita, also from the LDP.</p>

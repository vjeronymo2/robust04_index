			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The dramatic situation in Gorazde has been  reflected on the events in Tarcin. Our correspondent from Tarcin  has sent us this report:    All access roads to Tarcin are still blocked. According to  reports we have received so far, the situation is becoming  increasingly complex according to Bosnia-Hercegovina radio  broadcasts about the dramatic situation at the Gorazde  battlefield. At the first roadblock in Tarcin, we have learned  that despite all measures carried out by police forces of the  Hadzici public security station, soldiers of the Fifth Hill  Brigade, and members of the antiterrorist squad, embittered  citizens from eastern Bosnia [Muslim refugees] and the local  people expressing solidarity with their demands have seized  silos in which the arrested aggressor soldiers are being held.    Judging by the shots we heard fired from infantry weapons,  the Tarcin drama culminated this evening. This was immediately  followed by sirens of ambulance cars in Tarcin. However, we  still have not received any details about casualties. We are  unable to get details because Tarcin is completely blocked.  [passage omitted]    As we are filing this report, we have just received a report  that police forces and members of the antiterrorist squad have  seized the control of the silo prison again. However, the  protesters have taken three aggressor soldiers in an unknown  direction. [passage omitted]</p>

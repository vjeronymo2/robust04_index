			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / Survey of Business Locations in Europe (2): EC remains a powerful magnet - Inward investment activity from beyond the EC continues to be dominated by the US and by the Japanese, who are likely to maintain their predominant position / Countries in the European Community continue to attract a brisk level of inward investment DESPITE the global recession, which has inevitably dented the flow of international investment funds heading for Europe, the EC remains a magnet for incoming, corporate investment. The process of starting or expanding investment in Europe by companies based beyond its boundaries has become a more protracted business as economic uncertainties have multiplied. But the evidence shows that, in the face of the growing threat posed by booming investment centres along the Pacific Rim, the sheer scale and sophistication of European markets guarantees for many of them a continuing, high level of inward investment. Estimates suggest that the EC countries have, in the early part of the 1990s, been attracting in the region of Dollars 65-70bn of new, annual investment from beyond their boundaries. The general expectation is that, after some reduction as a result of recent economic weaknesses, they will continue to attract a major share of all corporate investment activity. The Americans - with around 30 per cent of all their corporate assets now located outside the US - are no strangers to investing in the EC and account for more than half the total foreign investment pouring in to the region. But while there are no suggestions the US will cease to become a leading player in European corporate investment, there are pressures being brought to bear which will make EC nations a less obvious target for spending by American corporations. The free trade agreement signed between the US and Canada, America's largest trading partner, and the new emphasis being placed on trade between Mexico and the US, mean that Europe is going to have to fight harder to claim its stake of North American investment. The Japanese have come comparatively late to overseas investment markets - a decade ago only 4 per cent of their total corporate assets lay overseas - but they have moved impressively to reach 15 per cent. After an initial period of heavy investment, however, most Japanese corporations have come under immense liquidity pressures and have moderated the pace of new foreign investment. Even so, 20 per cent of Japanese overseas investment is ending up in Europe. While most US companies appear to have positively based their decisions to locate in Europe on the scale and potential of the market, the Japanese seem, initially at least, to have been motivated more out of fear of being thwarted than by any renewal in protectionist sentiment. Whatever the motives behind the investment decisions being taken, the favourite destinations for external investors are clear. The United Kingdom continues to account for around one-third of all inward investment into the EC, although the number of projects underway has fallen back recently. No other EC nation has so far come anywhere near matching the record of the UK, which now ranks as home for 37 per cent of all non-EC companies operating within the community. Germany, despite its most recent economic and political problems, is still regarded as an important destination for inward funds but growing numbers of companies now regard the country as an extremely expensive and increasingly uncompetitive base from which to operate. German companies themselves have been underpinning the perception by transferring away from their own, high cost, country into other parts of Europe. The main beneficiaries have been the UK, France and Spain. But there is, equally, a perception that Germany is alive to its problems and that it will actively seek to protect the country's position as Europe's economic power-house, so maintaining the interest of foreign investors. France, which has not always had the most positive image for attracting overseas investment, has also been performing better in attracting incomers, not least because of the political priority which the issue has now been given at the highest levels. See report, page six. Belgium, which may have tended to expect its location at the political heart of Europe to stand it in good stead, is widely regarded to have lost out in the competition for inward investment, although it has now started to take the issue seriously. Holland, meanwhile, has pursued a very successful promotion strategy. Despite its location on the very fringes of the EC, the Republic of Ireland has also continued to attract a sizeable share of available foreign manufacturing investment and, in relation to gross domestic product, has done as well as any other EC member. Spain, too, has been proving increasingly attractive as investors watch it emerge as an important, open European market with a rapidly improving infrastructure. Although there are always exceptions, the general patterns on inward investment tend to have matched certain categories of corporate investment with particular EC regions. While the main investment activity in distribution has tended to be located within a belt which stretches from London, Rotterdam and Antwerp through Luxembourg, Metz and Nancy, European headquarters operations have concentrated on cities like Brussels, London, Geneva and Frankfurt. Manufacturing activities by inward investors have been very widely spread throughout the community, depending on proximity to the ultimate marketplace for the products concerned. The UK, Ireland, France and the Benelux countries have been taking the lion's share of available manufacturing investment. Given the increasing competition within Europe and beyond for whatever investment funds are available, it is clear that only the most aggressive marketing and the most supportive 'after-sales' operations at national or regional level can expect to succeed. While the degree of financial help is important - available EC incentives average around 15 per cent of capital spend by inward investors - it has become clear that investors are equally concerned about the extent to which they can seek guidance and advice after they have made their decision to locate. Some investors have complained that, while agencies have worked around the clock for months or years to attract companies, they have been left totally to their own devices once operations have started. According to one location specialist: 'Companies can feel very badly let down when they are feted, wined and dined - and then dropped after their arrival. 'Those responsible for encouraging inward investment must remember that investors may have chosen their patch once but that they have the whole of Europe to choose from next time. 'If they wish to maintain their inward investment, they have to build relationships which will last'.</p>

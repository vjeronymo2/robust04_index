			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Liberal Party presidential candidate Ernesto Samper </F> discusses his economic policy proposals during a meeting of the  29th Convention of Banking and Financing Institutions held 8  April in Cartagena]    [Text] Cartagena -- By means of a social agreement covering  competitiveness, prices, and salaries, candidate Ernesto Samper  proposes to lower the inflation rate quickly in the next four  years. In that way he will eliminate devaluation, as he feels  that cannot continue to be the tool used to reduce the cost of  living. These are the main proposals of the economic program he  will apply if elected president.  <H5>  Taxes </H5>   It is overhasty, inconsistent, and populist to suggest a new  tax reform to reduce the tax burden without knowing what the  fiscal situation will be in the next few months.  <H5>  Revaluation </H5>   A stable real rate of exchange will be a central goal. To  achieve that, the support of the entire private sector is needed.  <H5>  Banking </H5>   There will be no financial reform; on the contrary, there  will be stability in regulations and minimal government  intervention. There will be strict controls, but they will be  highly technical in nature.  <H5>  Credit </H5>   Commercial credit needs to reach more users and economic  sectors.  <H5>  Industry </H5>   An urban credit system will be established for small  businesses and industries, supported by a rediscount fund  (Finurbano [expansion not given]), sustained by external lines  of credit and government and budget resources. In addition,  there will be a rural savings and credit network similar to the  English postal savings system.  <H5>  Agriculture </H5>   Credit will be democratized and an ambitious land title  program will be implemented. This will help a large number of  campesinos who now have no formal property titles. That will  make it easier for them to obtain commercial financing and use  their assets in a modern productive system.  <H5>  Macroeconomy </H5>   Stabilization of the real exchange rate will first of all  require bringing inflationary pressures under control. In his  opinion, exchange stability and control of inflation are  interrelated goals.  <H5>  Fiscal Policy </H5>   Controlling inflation will be helped by coordinating fiscal  and monetary policy, which will avert demand-driven inflationary  pressures.  <H5>  Cusiana Resources </H5>   To handle the oil bonanza, an investment stabilization fund  will be set up to manage part of the Cusiana resources.  <H5>  Capital </H5>   He will propose to the stock exchanges the creation of a  mixed corporation which will actively promote the development of  the capital market. This agency will promote the stock market  with businesses that are not listed on the stock exchange and  the development of instruments like stock purchase programs and  project financing.  <H5>  Security </H5>   Efforts will be made to improve "peace management." All  departments of the government will be involved in creating  conditions that will make the return of the former armed rebels  to society feasible.  <H5>  Economic Liberalization </H5>   Colombia's closed domestic market will be eliminated in  order  to foster competitiveness, more exports, growth, and better jobs  and salaries. A great deal of private investment will be  stimulated.</p>

			<p><P> January 1, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 1988 THE YEAR IN REVIEW;  </P> <P> GUARDS AT POLLING PLACE:  </P> <P> Our readers wrote letters throughout 1988 expressing their viewpoints on a  variety of issues. Here are condensed versions of some of those letters. We  appreciate their taking the time to share their viewpoints and look forward to  hearing from you in 1989.  </P> <P>  To vote or not to vote? That was the question Orange County voters faced Nov.  8. That question became difficult in the 72nd Assembly District when the Orange  County Republican Party sent uniformed security guards to 20 Santa Ana  precincts to intimidate Hispanic voters.  </P> <P> As a registered Republican, even I am amazed at how bold our leaders have  become. Our elective process is founded on the principle that the voter not be  intimidated at the ballot box. Not since the 1960s have such tactics been used.  They were unjust then, and they are outrageously unjust now.  </P> <P> CHRISTOPHER PREVATT  </P> <P> Garden Grove  </P></p>

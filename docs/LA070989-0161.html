			<p><P> July 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROTESTS OVER, CHINA STUDENTS FACE EXAMS  </P> <P> The students in the courtyard of the Ritan High School on Saturday were not  thinking about pro-democracy protests, counterrevolutionary rebellions or  martial law. They were cramming.  </P> <P> Just six weeks ago, many of the high school seniors had joined in the massive  protests in Tian An Men Square, with banners assuring the demonstrators' older  university leaders, "We are your younger brothers and sisters; we are the next  you."  </P> <P> But now, with textbooks open under Beijing's baking summer sun, they were  sweating it out in the process of taking their college entrance exams.  </P> <P> The protests of the spring, they explained, are a thing of the past. The exams  are their future.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Politics Now Secondary  </P> <P> "We still care about politics, but right now that is secondary," said one  senior, an 18-year-old woman who spoke good English to an American visitor in  the courtyard shortly before an afternoon round of testing began. "This is the  most important thing in our life right now.  </P> <P> "If we fail, no job, no money bad life. But if we succeed now and make it to  the university, maybe then we can again think about politics. Yes, the pressure  on every one of us is very, very great right now."  </P> <P> "Black July," the students' traditional nickname for the all-important three  days of college testing, has arrived in Beijing. This year, it has a stark  double meaning with the exams coming just a few weeks after the army and  hard-line Communist Party leaders cracked down on the student-led protests and  killed hundreds -- some say thousands -- of pro-democracy demonstrators.  </P> <P> But there are other, larger forces at work in Chinese society. And for nervous  high school students throughout China this weekend, the present reality was  largely restricted to their own personal futures.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Pressure of Competition  </P> <P> The pressure is in the numbers. During the three days of testing that ends  today with an examination of their political loyalties, 2.26 million high  school students competed for 640,000 university slots. Nearly three-fourths of  them will not make the cut, and instead will be assigned to work units in  factories, offices or farms -- or, worse, be forced to go out and find their  own jobs at a time of unprecedented unemployment and inflation.  </P> <P> In Beijing, the students have some advantage. The schools here, and in most  major Chinese cities, are better than those in the countryside. But the  pressure to succeed also is intense in Beijing, where there were 34,800 high  school students trying to qualify for 17,000 university openings.  </P> <P> The exams, although similar in concept to America's Scholastic Aptitude Tests,  are far longer and more difficult than their U.S. counterparts. And now, after  eight years of economic liberalization have created a new consciousness of  consumerism and ambition once unheard of in Communist China, the pressure is  all the greater.  </P> <P> Even the English-language China Daily commented on the phenomenon. It told  about Zhu Zhisheng, who had accompanied his ailing son to school for the first  round of testing Friday. Last month, Zhu explained, his son was hospitalized  for a severe stomach ailment.  </P> <P> "I have to wait here," he told the newspaper. "I am afraid he might break  down."  </P> <P> So dreaded is the testing process that in the past it has led to widespread  cheating and even suicide.  </P> <P> A year ago, the government reported that one student had hidden a two-way  microphone inside his shirt and was fed answers from 21 collaborating teachers  and school officials. At the same time, the party newspapers told about a  19-year-old student who was caught cheating and later strangled his parents in  a fit of rage. And a third Beijing student who had been driven to suicide by  the entrance exams left a note that despondently proclaimed, "I am no longer  naive and happy. I have become indifferent to the outside world. I am just a  slave to exams. Only when I die can I be free."  </P> <P> Although Saturday's mood in the courtyard of Ritan High School was free of  evidence of such despair, many comments of the young men and women reflected  the additional anxiety provoked by the recent grim events, which occurred  during a time when high school seniors ordinarily would have been studying hard  for the entrance exams  </P> <P> The exams test students on a full range of subjects, including mathematics,  English, science, history and politics. The political testing that takes place  today was the subject of most of the conversation in the courtyard Saturday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Student Mocks Deng  </P> <P> "Oh yeah, Deng Xiaoping (China's paramount leader) is very correct," one  student shouted with a laugh. "Everything Comrade Deng says is perfectly  correct. This is how to pass the political exam."  </P> <P> Another young man was a bit more serious, but he sounded equally cynical.  </P> <P> "They ask us to differentiate between the capitalist system and the socialist  system, and we're supposed to include in our answer the facts that, No. 1, if  you want to be president of the United States, you have to be rich, and, No. 2,  the concept of democracy in the West only works for those who have money.  </P> <P> "But don't you have any of this kind of stuff in the United States?"  </P> <P> The American visitor replied that college entrance exams in the United States  test only academic subjects, not political indoctrination.  </P> <P> " . . . I wish I could take that test," the student replied. "I'd do just fine  on the American test."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hand of Caution  </P> <P> An even more serious student placed his hand on his friend's back and said,  "You shouldn't be saying these things to a foreigner," but the friend just  shrugged it off.  </P> <P> The 18-year-old woman who had said politics must now come second discussed her  role in the pro-democracy demonstrations more openly than the others in the  group.  </P> <P> "I was there," she said. "There were 1 million of us in the street. But the  newspapers in Beijing said we were only 30,000. And then, after the army came  (on June 3-4), I went around asking other students how many people had died,  and everyone said thousands, maybe 10,000. But the government said only 300  were killed. I think somebody is lying.  </P> <P> "We are still thinking about these things. They still worry us. But, well,  today, there just isn't time for this. We must worry more about our future."  </P> <P> Asked why it is so important for her personally to win a place in the  university, the woman pointed to the young man beside her and said, "He is a  boy. He has many paths he can take, even if he fails the exams. I am a girl. If  I fail, I have very few choices. I don't want to be a simple typist or a farmer  or a factory worker."  </P> <P> Asked about her aspirations, she said: "I want to be a teacher -- a Chinese  language teacher.  </P> <P> She said it didn't matter to her that an average teacher's salary in China is  only 160 yuan (about $40) a month. "The money isn't important. I just want to  do something useful."  </P> <P> Suddenly, her smile faded, and speaking almost in a whisper, she said: "Uh oh.  It's a soldier."  </P> <P> A People's Liberation Army officer in fatigues was frowning and staring as he  approached the group of students and the American.  </P> <P> "We better shut up, and you better go," she said nervously. "Besides, we have  to go take our exams. And that really is more important now."  </P> <P> Nick Driver, The Times' research assistant in Beijing, contributed to this  report.  </P></p>

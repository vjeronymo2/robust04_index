			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / Arts: On the wave of controversy - Video If a publicist was required to use one and the same adjective on every film, which would he choose? Would it be one of the rabble-rousers like 'Sexy,' 'Torrid' or 'Violent'? Would it a value judgment like 'Brilliant' or 'Unmissable'? Or would it be that word that answers every copywriter's prayer: 'Controversial.' This epithet has everything. It hints at sex or violence, or something equally inflammatory; it suggests that you will be stirred, if not to outrage, at least to deep and reverberant thoughts. But for controversy you need an arena. After years spent shuttling between private video parlour and public cinema, I realise that the main difference between the two venues is not big room versus small room; or viewer control versus passive spectacle; or even cheap versus expensive. The main difference is 'controversy'. You get it in one release context, not in the other. Take this month's videos. They include In The Name Of The Father, Jim Sheridan's film about the the Guildford Four and the Brits in Ireland, with Daniel Day Lewis chewing the scenery as scapegoat-martyr Gerry Conlon; Claire Devers' Noir Et Blanc, an eerie French study of sado-machism, involving two bodybuilders who work out, in all senses, on each's bodies; and Philadelphia, bringing together Aids, lawsuits and Oscar-winning Tom Hanks. All these are worth (re-)viewing on the VCR. And all three were significant stirrers-up when they hit the big screen. But in the second-time-around world of video reissue - and the fanfare-free intimacy of domestic viewing - what happens to their potential for controversy? Unlike a new TV programme, a Cathy Come Home or Death On The Rock, a 'new' video will not set a hundred newspaper columnists alight. It did that before as a movie. And although statistically most people watching a film on video are seeing it the first time, the public furore, if there was one, blew out months before. So what does this do to the culture? In one sense it is no different than the book world's time-lag between hardcover exposure and mass circulation in paperback. Latest Amis or Deighton? Thank you: we will wait till the price halves. But reading is a private activity; has been ever since Homer. Moviegoing is a group-friendly pastime, and video not only shrinks the group to three or two or one, it turns the viewing context into a low-tide littoral where the wave of debate broke and receded weeks or months before. As a film critic I want to cry 'Get out to those first-run cinemas, so you can catch the tide of controversy.' As a video critic, I have sympathy with those who want an easier, more inexpensive and flexible way to see films, and never mind the time lags. Late or soon, I suspect, expanding domestic screens will meet the shrinking screens of the multiplex age, in a glorious hi-tech rapprochement, and the two-phase release system will be phased out altogether. In the meantime my advice is: bring the controversy into your own homes. Discuss the movies you see on video with your peer groups or family groups. Be your own Late Show, South Bank Show or Arena] The three films named above are made for debate and are impoverished without it. Some movies, though, do exist happily in a one-to-one relationship with the viewer. This month you can shed an unruffled private tear over Shadowlands (CIC), telling of the cancer-doomed romance between CS Lewis (Anthony Hopkins) and his late American love Joy Gresham (Debra Winger). You can say farewell to Federico Fellini with his 1965 fantasia Juliet Of The Spirits (Fabulous Films), and with Gideon Bachman's entertaining bio-documentary Ciao Federico] (Connoisseur). And you can savour the much-praised charms of Tran Anh Hung's The Scent Of Green Papaya (Artificial Eye): a haunting French-Vietnamese film, shot like a moving still life, about love, loss and the lyricism of everyday domestic life.</p>

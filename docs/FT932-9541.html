			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Anglo American rejects Gencor unbundling lead ANGLO American Corporation, South Africa's largest company, said yesterday it would not be following Gencor's policy of unbundling into smaller units. It said that while unbundling might make sense for some groups, it did not believe that its current structure required it. Anglo's statement follows Tuesday's announcement by Gencor, the country's second largest mining house, that it will be distributing all its non-mining assets to shareholders, so halving its size. Anglo, with its complex corporate structure, has long been considered by both politicians and analysts as a likely candidate for unbundling. Yesterday's statement makes clear that South Africa's other large corporates will not necessarily be following Gencor's lead. Since the issue of unbundling was first raised three years ago, Anglo has vigorously defended its size. It says it is a mining finance group 'with different levels of holding and operating companies, many of which are listed, with separate though overlapping shareholders'. Without mentioning Gencor, Anglo stressed its structure has neither a controlling company (Sanlam in Gencor's case) 'nor any pyramid structures designed purely for holding purposes' (Gencor's Genbeheer). It also said more than 50 per cent of its shares were held publicly. Anglo said its size helped it undertake large capital projects while its diversity of assets conferred contra-cyclical benefits.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Y. C. Tsai] </F>   [Text] Taipei, April 21 (CNA) -- Taiwan's strategy to  promote strategic alliances with world-renowned multinational  companies has begun to pay off as domestic computer products are  making inroads into the Japanese market.    Shu Liang, president of Mitac Inc., said Thursday [21 April]  that his company will soon deliver 1,000 industrial computers to  Tokyo's Narita International Airport. Mitac is a leading  computer manufacturer in Taiwan.    The computer deal is part of an international procurement  contract won by the US-based Westinghouse Co., which entered  into a strategic alliance with Mitac last August, Shu said.    The computers, which will boost Narita's information control  equipment, are designed and produced by Mitac with technical  assistance from Westinghouse, he elaborated.    Previously, he added, such computers were wholly  manufactured  by Westinghouse.    The business executive saw bright prospects in the  cooperative ties, saying aggregate orders from Japan for similar  computers are expected to top 5,000 computers, or NT [new  Taiwan]$200 million (US$7.54 million).    Moreover, he pointed out, the deal certainly will have a  positive impact on Mitac's computer quality and expertise. "We  are happy to become Westinghouse' partner in the Asia-Pacific  region," he said.    Mitac and Westinghouse hosted a seminar on information  technology in Taipei last month to explore the great market  potential here, he noted.</p>

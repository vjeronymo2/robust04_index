			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / Church plans housing scheme More than 300 chapels are expected to be demolished and replaced by social housing in a scheme by the Presbyterian Church of Wales to take account of falling congregations. The church has 977 chapels, mostly Victorian, and a membership of less than 56,000, with some congregations as small as 12. The Rev Daffyd Owen, the church's general secretary, said yesterday: 'Membership has been in steady decline since the end of the first world war. Most of Wales has a huge overcapacity of church buildings - in many rural areas the capacity is more than the total adult population. 'We think this is a positive reaction to the decline. A message has been coming through that the church has not been sufficiently concerned about the community at large and not using its resources in line with the gospel message.' The cost of repair and restoration of all the chapels has been estimated at Pounds 35m. Mr Owen said: 'Even if we had the money, it would be ridiculous to spend in that way.' The sites will be valued and sold to Aelwyd (Hearthside) Housing Association, set up three years ago by the church in conjunction with the United Reformed Church and Baptists. The association will develop the sites for those in housing need. The church intends to use part of the income from the land sales to subsidise rents. Decisions on closures, which are expected to be phased over 10 years, will be subject to final approval by the church's general assembly. Worshippers would attend other nonconformist services. Mr Owen acknowledged that there was a great deal of opposition. He said: 'There is a very close emotional attachment between church members and their buildings. It needs a sea change in our thinking and attitudes which I think is vitally important.'</p>

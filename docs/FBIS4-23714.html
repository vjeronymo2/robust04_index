			<p>BFN     [Text] Pretoria June 13 SAPA -- The Conservative Party [CP]  is to make direct representation to the constitutional assembly  for the formation of an Afrikaner volkstaat [homeland]. This was  agreed to on Monday [13 June] when CP leader Dr Ferdi  Hartzenberg and Freedom Front leader Gen Constand Viljoen met  First Deputy President Thabo Mbeki in Pretoria.    A joint statement issued afterwards said the CP would also  pursue the matter with the various parties represented in the  government of national unity.    It said the CP's request to negotiate directly with the  government -- originally communicated to President Nelson  Mandela -- would be conveyed to the cabinet for its  consideration.    "The meeting recognised the fact that the constitution  provided for a mechanism and a process to address the question  of a volkstaat," the statement said.</p>

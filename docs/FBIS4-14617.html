			<p>BFN     [Text] According to approximate calculations by the foreign  economic relations department of the Ministry of Finance, the  Latvian foreign debt up to 31 March of this year has reached  more than $200 million and not $320 million U.S. dollars, as was  envisaged. The reduction in the foreign debt is connected to  the envisaged foreign country credits not being received during  the first quarter of this year.</p>

			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / International Company News: Foster's sells 15m BHP shares Foster's, the Australian brewing company which owns Courage in the UK, announced yesterday that the sale of around 15m shares in Broken Hill Proprietary, a result of the restructuring of the Beswick investment, had gone ahead at slightly higher than anticipated prices. As a result, the net cash proceeds to Foster's resulting from the restructuring deal will be ADollars 251m (USDollars 180.5m) and the brewing group will book a profit, in effect tax-free, of ADollars 208m. Beswick, set up in 1988,owns almost one-fifth of BHP's equity and, in turn, is owned primarily by BHP and Foster's. Foster's has been keen to realise some of the increased value in the Beswick investment, which has resulted from the rise in the value of BHP shares over recent years. BHP, however, has been reluctant to change Beswick's ownership structure. The restructuring scheme was devised to satisfy two competing demands. It provided for the issue to existing Beswick shareholders of new convertible redeemable preference shares. Beswick would then sell a small portion of its 322m BHP shares, and use the proceeds to redeem the bulk of Foster's new preference shares. The issue of the preference shares had already taken place, but yesterday's manoeuvres complete the process. BHP shares closed 26 cents lower at ADollars 17.08.</p>

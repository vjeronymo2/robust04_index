Victor Voichita, chairman of the Romanian Party for New  Society, said Korea is an independent country.    He stressed:    "Independence is the life and soul of a country and a  nation.  The Korean people are firmly adhering to independence in the  revolution and construction as they are advancing with a tight  hold on the line of independence, self-sustenance and  self-reliance in defence. With this great line, Korea is  vigorously accelerating socialist construction without the  slightest vacillation."    Secretary General of the Central Committee of the Dominican  Communist Party Narciso Isa Conde said:    "The Korean people are solving all the questions in  socialist  construction by their own efforts. As they have a powerful  independent economy, the party, the government and the people of  Korea strictly abide by their will and demand in working out and  implementing lines and policies.    "The Korean people have registered world-startling  achievements as we see today by implementing the line of  building an independent economy under the wise guidance of the  dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il."    Prof. and Dr. P.C. Verma of the University of Delhi, India  noted that the history of socialist construction of Korea  practically shows the socialist cause is unswervingly advancing,  overcoming whatever grim ordeals, as the idea is great and the  revolutionary line is correct. He stated:    "Korean-style socialism is socialism of chuche which  develops  with the chuche idea as a guideline.    "The chuche idea is applied to the political, economic and  defence sectors. The example of Korea in enforcing independent  politics to defend and realize independence and building an  independent economy which walks on its own feet and self-reliant  national defence power capable of reliably defending the  security of the country and the gains of revolution is a great  success, which all the countries should follow.    "Korea which is implementing the line of independence,  self-sustenance and self-reliance in defence under the wise  guidance of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il will further  prosper and develop and stand forever as a fortress of  socialism."</p>

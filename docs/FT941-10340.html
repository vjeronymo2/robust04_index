			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / Hosokawa gloomy on trade accord: Talks on reducing Tokyo's enormous surplus are in trouble Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, Japan's prime minister, leaves for Washington today with a smaller bundle of gifts to offer the US president than he would have liked. The main 'offering' is an economic stimulus package, already belittled by US officials as a 'moderate step,' which he hopes will help convince the US that his government is doing what it can to boost domestic demand and reduce the country's enormous trade surplus. But barring a surprise, Mr Hosokawa will have little to persuade President Bill Clinton and his team of trade negotiators that their calls for tangible results in improving access to Japanese markets have at last been heeded. Mr Hosokawa was pessimistic that the talks - which were continuing in Washington - could be brought to a successful conclusion before his meeting with President Clinton. 'Everything has come to an impasse,' Mr Hosokawa told reporters. Meanwhile, Mr Tsutomu Hata, the foreign minister, yesterday left for Washington in an effort to save the talks. The difficulty the US and Japan have in reaching a satisfactory trade agreement lies more in the method than in the goal. Both are broadly agreed that Japan needs to stimulate domestic demand, improve access to its markets and bring down its trade surplus and that the US needs to reduce its fiscal deficit, promote saving and strengthen international competitiveness. The problem is, while US negotiators insist on setting clear quantitative indicators of progress to ensure that Japan keeps its part of the deal, Japanese bureaucrats, politicians and businessmen alike insist that such targets are unacceptable because they lead to managed trade. 'The US should understand that putting up a certain quantitative goal and trying to achieve it . . . isn't something that can happen in the real business world,' Mr Takakazu Kuriyama, Japan's ambassador to the US said recently. But there is more to the Japanese resistance to numerical targets than a dislike of managed trade. Indeed Japan has never had much difficulty with the idea of managing trade and has long been something of a model of a managed economy. However, they feel there are too many problems with managing trade right now. For one thing, it goes against the popular call to deregulate the economy. The Hosokawa government's expressed intention to reduce bureaucratic red tape and allow free market forces to play a bigger part in Japanese economic life has gone over well with the public. A government which has hung on to power largely on the strength of its public popularity would hardly be helping itself by bowing to US pressure for goals which would require bureaucratic meddling with market forces. In areas such as government procurement where the government can take steps without interfering in private business, some progress has reportedly been made, while there has been no progress in cars and car parts, which are completely in the private sector. There is also concern about what would happen if such targets were agreed and could not be met. Past experience has proved a bitter lesson for the Japanese: neither the semiconductor agreement and the announcement by Japanese car makers of their procurement plans for foreign car parts were intended as government commitments but have been treated as such by the US. But just as important as these concerns is a changing public perception of Japan's status in the world order. The country has frequently been criticised for lacking leadership on the world stage comparable to its economic might. There is a growing urge, not just among bureaucrats, but among younger politicians and the general public as well, to be seen to play a more responsible role. And to do so, Japan cannot constantly bow to foreign pressure but must take its fate into its own hands. 'Japan is ready to carry out its reforms out of its own initiative, and not because of foreign pressure and particularly not because of US pressure,' said an official. It was important to resist US pressure for targets now to ensure that this point was understood. 'The next summit will be the opening of a new relationship between the two countries on an equal footing,' he said.</p>

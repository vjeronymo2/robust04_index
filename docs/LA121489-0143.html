			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SAN FRANCISCO;  </P> <P> EGYPTIAN LOSES BID FOR POLITICAL ASYLUM  </P> <P> The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld denial of political asylum to an  Egyptian citizen who said he was persecuted at home by Muslims because he is a  Coptic Christian. Amir Ghobrial had told the Board of Immigration Appeals of  being stoned at age 14 by Muslims and of being beaten while a university  student. He testified that Christians in Egypt fear attending church and  wearing crosses, and their churches are sometimes bombed or burned. However,  the court ruled that "Evidence of widespread tensions and generalized violence  between Muslims and Christians in Egypt does not establish a well-founded fear  of persecution."  </P></p>

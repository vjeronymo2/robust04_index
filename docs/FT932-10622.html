			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Survey of Canadian Forest Products (4): Two sides face new realities - Labour Relations TECHNOLOGICAL change, increased world competition and a reduced supply of raw materials have created a new relationship between organised labour and Canada's forest industries. While friendly may be too strong a word for dealings between the opposing parties, the unions have become more co-operative, and employers have been prepared to reward concessions on work practices. In many areas, such as the conflict with environmentalists and the challenge of international competitors, the two sides have recognised that their interests are similar. The unions' attitude to change in the workplace is based on the calculation that it is better to lose a few jobs at a mill than to have no mill at all. Mr Doug Smyth, head of research at the Vancouver-based Canadian branch of the International Woodworkers of America (IWA), says efficiency is vital. 'You have to increase productivity to survive in world markets. We not only went along with the productivity improvements (requested by management) but in many cases we insisted on them so the jobs of our members would be protected,' he says. The IWA in British Columbia was one of the earliest unions to face the new reality. In the cyclical downturn from 1980 to 1982, employment in the wood products sector which the IWA dominates fell at about the same pace as production. But when demand picked up in 1983, employment stayed at about the same level and productivity soared. Mr Mark Thompson, a professor of industrial relations at University of British Columbia, points to a long-term pattern, with workers being highly paid and militantly unionised, and companies responding by becoming more capital-intensive. Some sectors have slipped from the IWA's grasp. Most remaining shake and shingle mills - hit by high US duties - have gone non-union or have special deals. The plywood industry has also suffered, with some mills going to employee co-operatives. But in the core dimension lumber sector, the IWA remains entrenched. To face its strength, employers in British Columbia work through combined bargaining bodies. Forest Industrial Relations (FIR) represents companies on the coast, and there are two equivalent organisations in the interior. Unlike the lumber industry, the pulp and paper sector has always been very capital-intensive. Automation has increased in recent years, but there has not been the same scope for large productivity gains. The greatest pressure on the pulp and paper industry is coming from US mills where employees have agreed five- and six-year no-strike contracts which provide for 365-day-a-year operation. Canadian unions have fought hard over the years for the right to take off statutory holidays such as Christmas Day, but now the employers want to talk again, because of the cost of having half a billion dollars' worth of machine sitting idle. Mr Thompson suggests that employees may have to give up some of their holidays and other provisions to allow 365-day operation in Canada. 'Emotionally, that's hard for a union to swallow'. In the latest downturn, there have been some pulp and paper mill shutdowns on the west coast, and there will probably be more, but the axe has fallen hardest in the east. Mr Bob Strother, vice-president of human resources at Noranda Forest, says: 'Because of competitive pressures, there has been a lot of downsizing and restructuring. A lot of mills in the east are not competitive and a lot of jobs have been lost permanently.' Shutdowns are having an effect. Mr Strother says: 'There's an increased recognition by everybody involved that everybody's interests have to be accommodated.' One indication of change has come at four Ontario box plants owned by Domtar, where 500 workers have agreed an eight-year contract retroactive to July 1991. Their union, the Independent Paperworkers of Canada, broke away from the Communications, Energy and Paperworkers of Canada, saying that union had failed to be flexible enough to ensure the survival of members' jobs. It remains to be seen if similar agreements can be reached in current negotiations in eastern Canada. Most of the industry agreed three-year contracts in 1990, the majority of which expired at the end of April. The BC pulp and paper industry's contract - agreed after a 5 1/2 -week strike in 1992 does not come up until next year. In the pulp and paper sector, there has been a clear differentiation between British Columbia and eastern Canada. In the east, contracts have been reached through 'pattern bargaining'. The unions reach an agreement with one major employer and then try to impose those terms on the rest of the industry. In BC, the pulp and paper industry has traditionally negotiated with the unions at a single table. But now the employers have abandoned their joint negotiating body in favour of mill-by-mill negotiations. The Pulp and Paper Employee Relations Forum (analogous to FIR in the wood products industry) will now act as an adviser to individual companies, rather than handling negotiations directly. The unions are expected to react by attempting to establish pattern bargaining in BC. Ideally, this will allow more flexibility to reach agreements which reflect the requirements of each mill. But the last strike was about work practices and next year's negotiations could be fairly sticky. One indication of the new climate of co-operation in British Columbia is the Western Wood Products Forum, where the IWA and six of the biggest wood products industry employers work together on non-collective bargaining issues. Mr Chris Duke, its executive director, says the forum is an attempt to build consensus on how to solve industry problems. Its latest report concludes that thousands more jobs will be lost as the availability of fibre declines over the next 10 years. Another issue is the fate of workers laid off from mills. Their skills are often not readily transferable to other industries and many forest products plants are based in one-industry towns. Despite having to share some pain, Canadian forestry workers are among the most productive and best paid in the world, and they are going to fight to keep it that way.</p>

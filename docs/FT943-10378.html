			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Genetically disabling the virus The human immune system can, given time, fight off just about any microscopic invader. But the body is sometimes overwhelmed by an invader before it can muster its defences, writes Daniel Green. At a conference in Vancouver, Canada, yesterday, UK biotechnology company Cantab presented the results of animal experiments that promise to overcome this problem: it has developed a way of genetically disabling a virus so that it stimulates the immune system but does not reproduce and cause illness. The Disabled Infectious Single Cycle virus seems to work by preventing and curing herpes in mice and guinea pigs. Cantab's manufacturing plant should be ready by the end of the year.

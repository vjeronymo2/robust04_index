			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Music to political ears: Jurek Martin on the role of talk-radio hosts in the US elections Allan Loudell is passionate about steam radio. Programme director at WILM-AM, the news-talk station in Wilmington, Delaware, he believes it has a mission to inform. His station offers a catholic mix of local, national and foreign news that is often comparable to the best that the BBC can offer. It is certainly as good as any in the US, a remarkable achievement for a shoe-string operation that expects its reporters to use old-fashioned typewriters. But when, at 1.05pm, he heaves himself out of his noon-hour anchor seat, perhaps having interviewed the correspondents in Washington for Al-Ahram of Egypt and even the Financial Times, he gives way to three hours of the man now synonymous with the political power of talk radio, the cigar-chomping arch-conservative who has given the term 'Rush to judgment' new meaning. In fact, Rush Limbaugh and his phoners-in, known as Dittoheads and given to gathering in bars called Rush Rooms, have been somewhat less than buoyant this week. Project Restore Democracy, as he coins his programme after the labels given to US military missions overseas, is having a little difficulty with the predicted survival of two liberal icons whose demise he has ardently predicted in Tuesday's mid-term elections - Governor Mario Cuomo of New York and Senator Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts. Even President Bill Clinton, the butt of most of his sometimes entertaining, more often savage bile, has picked up a little in the polls. But Limbaugh will have plenty to crow about on Tuesday. Loudell contracted with him three years ago because WILM's afternoon ratings were at their lowest and Limbaugh was already head-and-shoulders above the rest of the talk-show competition. At about Dollars 6,000 (Pounds 3,700) a year, WILM has a bargain and its audience is well up (the Limbaugh programme commands six-figure fees in major metropolitan markets). Radio polemicism dates back to the 1930s when Father John Coughlan assailed communists and President Franklin Roosevelt's reassuring fireside chats gave hope that the Depression was not forever. Contemporary inter-active talk radio shares some of the same roots, but is now even more angrily populist and political, with a strong libertarian strain. The business, which has expanded four-fold in 10 years to reach an estimated 1,000 stations, even has its own trade magazine - naturally called Talkers. An estimated 70 per cent of its practitioners are conservative, in Loudell's view, more because of audience profile than because of current political trends. Talk radio first began to blossom 30 years ago in the Midwest on lower frequency but high-powered AM stations (medium-wave in Europe) which were heavily into sports and thus drew a mainly older white male audience of conservative bent. With younger listeners still preferring the variety and better reception of stereo FM, this remains the predominant demographic audience profile. Other right-wing hosts now popular - though well behind Limbaugh in appeal - include Pat Buchanan, a talk-show pioneer who ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 1992, and G. Gordon Liddy, the old Watergate felon. On the left, but with smaller audiences still, stand Jerry Brown, perennial candidate and ex-governor of California, and Jim Hightower, once Texas agriculture commissioner. Popular iconoclasts broadcasting from New York include the satirical and frequently scatological Don Imus, heard in the mornings mostly on all-sports stations across the country. There is also the outrageous Howard Stern, who briefly ran for governor of the state as a Libertarian this summer, but withdrew because he refused to comply with the financial disclosure standards required of candidates. Talk radio - and its later blooming relation, talk television - proved a new campaign tool in the 1992 presidential election. Ross Perot virtually launched his independent candidacy on Larry King's TV programme - and he is now the host of his own radio show. Though he is now much the object of the medium's discontent, Bill Clinton showed himself to be its master two years ago, a good talker and more than a match for Imus in the morning. George Bush, with his fractured syntax, clearly viewed talk radio as some new-fangled horror beneath his dignity. In the mid-term elections, talk-radio controversy has already bubbled up in one important race for the US Senate. Bob Grant, of WABC-AM in New York, is accused by his critics of bigotry and racism. But politicians he has endorsed, such as Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of New York and Governor Christie Whitman of New Jersey, have been accustomed to appear on his programme. The gauntlet was thrown down by Senator Frank Lautenberg, the Democrat up for re-election in New Jersey. He announced he was boycotting the Grant programme because of what he called its 'filth-spewing' content and dared his opponent, Chuck Haytaian, to do the same, which he did not. Then the New Jersey Transit Authority announced it was suspending all advertising on WABC-AM. Grant is unrepentant, naturally, but Lautenberg, his political point made, is apparently cruising to victory proving that not all talk-show hosts are that influential. Generally, however, the angry populism of the broadcasters is directed against Washington and its incumbents, mostly Democrats. Thus, the latest Newsweek quotes a Republican pollster on Oliver North's campaign for the senate in Virginia: 'To many voters, his history (lying to Congress over the Iran-Contra scandals) won't matter much. He's the handy voice of talk-show anger.' Howard Kurtz, media correspondent of the Washington Post, recently spent 24 hours listening to what he described as 'the rawest form of media democracy'. He observed: 'This all-gab environment has changed the rules for politicians and their handlers, who once thought it sufficient to stamp out a brushfire in the New York Times or Newsweek but may now find it raging out of control in Cincinnati, New Orleans or Tucson.' Loudell fears it could get worse, noting that some programme directors 'have begun to consider ideology as part of a station's 'identity''. They find it increasingly difficult to entertain alternative views, 'much as a hard-rock album station would alienate its audience by playing Abba', he says. In this election year the music is not gentle on the ear.</p>

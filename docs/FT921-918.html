			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Arts: The Camden Jazz Festival If Chick Corea is Scientology's answer to Cliff Richard, then the Church of England had better watch out. His Elektric band came and conquered the Royal Festival Hall again, as part of the Camden Jazz Festival, with its devotion to slick fusion and the micro-chip. A large part of the excitable crowd had clearly been indoctrinated by Corea long ago, in his early electric days with Return to Forever. Others were there to worship also at the pedals of super-guitarist Frank Gambale or submit to Dave Weckl's hypnotic power drumming. Either way, they left fulfilled, full of fusion and, thanks to the Pounds 3 concert programme, totally au fait with the master's midi processors and the kind of stick Weckl favours. With a repertoire that verges on the hard rock, Corea's material is fast and furious in a friendly way, and written to give full exposure to his disciples' mind-boggling dexterity with their chip-driven instruments. Ballads counted for nothing as each member of the Elektric Band sought to confuse the muddy acoustics of the Festival Hall with impossibly complex solo excursions. As usual, Corea himself often wore a state of the art keyboard on a shoulder strap, caressing it at one point to produce a cello solo. During the obligatory five minute drum solo Weckl's sticks produced bass guitar lines from the pads sitting beside the cymbals. Gambale, looking for an alternative to the familiar guitar sound was able to employ the same instrument for whispering synth chords. Only Eric Marienthal, a feisty saxophonist, was left with the reedy declamation that God intended for the alto. Moving quickly through older material to tunes from the latest offering, Beneath the Mask (GRP), Corea closed with an extended homage to Miles, his pre-audit employer. The thumping stop/start fusion suite was played with such verve and vigour by the leader, a muso close by me was moved to comment, 'It makes you want to cut your fingers off'. The night before, saxophone virtuoso John Harle wound up his Shadow of the Duke tour at the Bloomsbury Theatre, which is where most of the Camden festival is taking place. Clumsily billed as the BT John Harle Band, the project is intended as a tribute to Duke Ellington and features some surprising Ellington/Strayhorn compositions as well as standards such as 'The Mooche' and 'In a Mellotone'. (Incidentally, didn't EMI do well to arrange for BT to chip in for Harle's tour and album? The company, which also owns the Blue Note label, has persuaded hi-fi manufacturer Technics to co-sponsor its showcase of new British jazz talent as part of the festival and the recording to follow in the Summer.) Harle's Shadow of the Duke is not on Blue Note but on EMI Classics which gives a clue to his musical orientation. Classically trained as a soloist, he regularly has concertos written for him. He is a composer and a conductor, and one of his many major film soundtracks has won a Cannes gong. He tours with the Michael Nyman Band, is Professor of Saxophone at the Guildhall and plays children's concerts. He is Mr Perfect. But can he play? Yes, and some, in this concert of two parts beginning with a series of dramatic, thematic suites co-written with score composer Stanley Myers and executed by the eleven pieces. Marred only by arrangements which called for drums in clumps, the two sawing synths and bright brass, led by Henry Lowther's trumpet, were an ideal backdrop to Harle's sweet-toned soprano. The mixture of Ellington compositions for the second half was thoughtfully chosen, from the dreamy vibes with voice on 'Caravan' to the luxurious soprano confection of 'Sucrier Velours'. 'Sonnet for Caesar' and 'Star Crossed Lovers', were eerily tape looped and filled with gravity, eventually bursting triumphantly into 'In a Mellotone'. Harle's own tribute, 'The Shadow of the Duke', closed with him pitching in perfectly to match Sarah Leonard's soaring soprano top line. Festival ends March 28 Information: 071-860-5866 John Harle sponsored by BT</p>

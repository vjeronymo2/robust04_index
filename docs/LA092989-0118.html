			<p><P> September 29, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DESIGN REVIEW LAW REJECTED  </P> <P> The Hermosa Beach City Council defeated by a 4-1 vote Tuesday a proposed  ordinance that would have increased the city's design control and environmental  review of large-scale commercial developments.  </P> <P> The vote overturned the recommendations of the Planning Commission and of  Planning Director Michael Schubach, who had recommended adoption.  </P> <P> Under the proposed ordinance, the council and Planning Commission would have  been given discretionary review power to assess projects such as hotels, office  buildings and retail developments for their impact on noise, traffic, parking  and the surrounding neighborhood.  </P> <P> Currently, such projects are subject only to administrative review, meaning  that no additional environmental assessment is necessary if the project meets  the city's building and zoning standards, Schubach said.  </P> <P> Mayor June Williams voted in favor of the proposed ordinance, arguing that the  city needs increased discretionary review power to reduce the impact of large  projects throughout the city.  </P> <P> But other council members criticized the ordinance, saying it was too  restrictive and would place city officials in the position of evaluating the  aesthetics of projects, rather than assessing their conformity to zoning and  building standards.  </P></p>

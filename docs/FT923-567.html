			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / Amato puts future on lineover budget: Union opposition grows THE determination of the Amato government to introduce a tough austerity budget for 1993 will be tested this week as trade union protest gathers momentum and the political parties seek to impose amendments. Mr Giuliano Amato, the Socialist prime minister, repeated over the weekend, in even stronger language than before, that he would resign if the budget was watered down. But the trade union leadership, encouraged by last week's support for rolling regional four-hour general strikes to protest at proposed welfare cuts, looks set to call a nationwide stoppage early next month. This week there will be more regional general strikes, with the promise of other stoppages in specific sectors. At the same time both the Christian Democrat and Socialist party bosses, central to the stability of the fragile four-party coalition government, are pledged to submit changes to soften the impact of the budget on their electorate. The 1993 outline budget proposes to raise L93,000bn (Pounds 43.7bn) in new revenues and spending cuts. The protests focus on proposals to make the first real cuts in the system of public welfare established after the war. The government is proposing to cap pensions payments as part of a wider reform to extend the pensionable age to 65 and limit the level of state funding. A big shake-up of the health service is also on the books. Mr Amato says the present welfare state - generous and inefficient - risks bankrupting the economy. In an interview in the daily La Repubblica yesterday, Prof Amato warned bluntly: 'We are in an extremely difficult situation. The government has put before parliament measures it deems both adequate and indispensable. If parliament says they are not indispensable and cuts them back, it is clear at this point that neither the government nor parliament is capable of getting out of this storm. Thus it is useless to stay on because there is nothing left to do.' Last week Mr Amato said he intended to put the 1993 budget to a vote of confidence in parliament to speed the debate and concentrate politicians' minds on the disastrous state of Italy's public finances. Both the government and the Bank of Italy recognise approval of the budget is necessary before the lira can return to the European Monetary System, from which it withdrew, along with sterling, 11 days ago.</p>

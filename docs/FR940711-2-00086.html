Applicants (other than federally recognized Indian tribal governments) should contact their State Single Point of Contacts (SPOCs) as early as possible to alert them to the prospective applications and to receive any necessary instructions on the State process. For proposed projects serving more than one State, the applicant is advised to contact the SPOC for each affected State. A current list of SPOCs is included in the application kit. If SPOCs have any State process recommendations on applications submitted to CDC, they should forward them to Henry S. Cassell, III, Grants Management Officer, Grants Management Branch, Procurement and Grants Office, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 255 East Paces Ferry Road, NE., Atlanta, GA 30305, no later than 30 days after the application deadline date. (A waiver for the 60-day requirement has been requested.) The granting agency does not guarantee to ``accommodate or explain'' State process recommendations it receives after that date. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

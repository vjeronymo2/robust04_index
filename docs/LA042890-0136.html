			<p><P> April 28, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE ROLLER-COASTER RIDE OF THE NEW AMERICAN ORCHESTRA;  </P> <P> MUSIC: KEEPING A BIG BAND TOGETHER IS TOUGH IN THESE TIMES, BUT THIS ENSEMBLE  WILL MARK 11 YEARS OF TOGETHERNESS AT A ROYCE HALL CONCERT.  </P> <P> The problems involved in keeping a big band together have plagued musicians  ever since the swing era ended. Where do you find jobs for 16 men? Whom do you  commission to write for them and how do you pay them? Where can you travel,  given the huge cost of plane fares? How do you keep the ensemble racially  integrated?  </P> <P> Multiply these questions by four or five and you have an idea of what has  confronted the Foundation for New American Music, a nonprofit group under whose  auspices the New American Orchestra, then 84 strong, started its roller-coaster  life 11 years ago this week at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion.  </P> <P> The orchestra will celebrate its anniversary tonight at Royce Hall, which will  henceforth be its regular home. "Acoustically, it's the ideal place for us,"  says its director, Jack Elliott. "Also, after dropping down to 60, we've added  some strings to bring it back up to 72, so we'll have the depth we need."  </P> <P> Under Elliott's aegis, the orchestra has introduced 83 new works. Best  remembered are Patrick Williams' "Concerto for Orchestra," which has been  utilized in several forms since its premiere at the first concert in 1979, and  two works by Manny Albam featuring saxophonists Phil Woods and Bud Shank. Best  forgotten is a piece by Claus Ogerman written to feature trumpeter Freddie  Hubbard. ("He didn't write it to show Freddie's strengths -- well, we played it  anyway, and it was a disaster.")  </P> <P> Tonight's program, typically, will mix pop, jazz and "legitimate" elements.  Saxophonist Michael Brecker will make his first appearance with the NAO. Dave  Grusin, joined by such sidemen as Harvey Mason, Abe Laboriel, Tom Scott and Sal  Marquez, will play excerpts from his film scores. There will be three newly  commissioned compositions: pianist Tom Garvin's "Day at the River," Patrick  Williams' "Overture to a Time" and a movement from Clare Fischer's "Prelude and  Fugue for Orchestra."  </P> <P> The last half hour, Elliott says, "will be a salute to the 50th anniversary of  Broadcast Music Inc. -- a huge medley sung by Patti Austin, Jack Jones, Kenny  Rankin and Phil Perry."  </P> <P> The BMI medley clearly is the orchestra's quid pro quo, since that organization  contributed "a big donation." Such deals are essential to the ensemble's  survival.  </P> <P> "That we are still alive after 11 years is due to sheer perseverance," Elliott  says, "and to the devotion and help of a core group of financial supporters,  along with major funding from a series of sponsors, including a Connecticut  life insurance company, then AT&amp;T, and most recently Sanyo-Fisher, who will  present us with a New York orchestra Sept. 8 in Avery Fisher Hall."  </P> <P> Because no symphony orchestra gives composers the opportunities the eclectic  NAO has offered, its existence is important, even though some critics have  questioned its claim to be a symphonic jazz ensemble. (Elliott dislikes that  label, claims he still can't find the right name tag, and wishes he could just  refer to it as "the band.")  </P> <P> "We're in a Catch-22 situation. During the Reagan and Bush administrations, the  changes in the tax laws and the arts endowment situation have created enormous  difficulties in fund-raising. We are told 'Go to the private sector,' but  meanwhile they've taken away the inducement to the private sector to donate!"  </P> <P> Another problem has been that of keeping the orchestra integrated. Recently  Elliott talked with bassist John Clayton about keeping a line open to the black  community. Clayton says: "I'm excited about it. I feel Jack is a doer, not a  talker, and he really wants minorities represented. Some time in the next year  I'll be writing something for the orchestra, and playing too."  </P> <P> Finding new guest soloists who are willing to rehearse and perform is another  constant challenge. Some of Elliott's fondest memories involve Sarah Vaughan.  "She was foremost among the people who were truly supportive in those difficult  early years. She came to the Chandler and worked for nothing. She was back  there for our fifth anniversary, the night we had Quincy Jones; that night she  sang with James Ingram. It's people like Sarah who have given us hope -- and  believe me, it hasn't always been easy to keep hoping."  </P></p>

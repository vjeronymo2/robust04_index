			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / Africa's delinquent debtors fall in line The African Development Bank is forecasting a big reduction in its loan arrears following this year's introduction of tougher sanctions against delinquent borrowers, said Mr Babacar Ndiaye, the bank's president, in London this week. The bank has been under pressure from its first world shareholders to tackle mounting arrears following a report by external consultants, which called for a shake-up to address deficient lending procedures and chaotic management. Arrears at the end of August were expected to be down by about a quarter from the 6.6 per cent of outstanding loans recorded at the end of 1993, said Mr Ndiaye, despite having risen sharply in the first half of the year. Cameroon, one of five bank debtors in chronic arrears, had already cleared its backlog, he said, and another, Congo, would have done so by the end of August. The bank's other delinquent debtors are Zaire, Liberia and Somalia. The bank's OECD members have held up replenishment of the bank's soft loan arm, the African Development Fund, pending evidence that these problems are being tackled. Earlier this year Mr Ruud Treffers, the Dutch co-ordinator for the soft-loan replenishment, warned that the arrears could threaten the bank's financial viability. Such warnings prompted concern in South Africa - which the bank is anxious to bring in as a large shareholder and borrower. Mr Ndiaye has sought to allay such fears in a trip to South Africa. He has been helped by leading rating agencies, which have renewed the bank's Triple A rating for its senior debt. The bank has also introduced tougher loan loss provision policies, a new organisational structure has been planned and steps have been taken to bolster reserves. The bank's president said he was optimistic the deadlock over replenishment, which has disrupted the work of the African Development Fund, could be resolved. He believed the bank had gone a long way towards meeting demands tabled by the fund's donors in May. African member countries nonetheless remain unhappy about the proposed level of replenishment, which reflects budgetary constraints in the donor countries more than any assessment of Africa's needs. Mr Ndiaye called for an increase in the level of replenishment in the light of the measures taken by the bank. A consequence of the tougher policy on provisions is likely to be a reduction in the current year's income. Like other financial institutions the bank has also suffered losses on its bond portfolio in the first quarter of the year.</p>

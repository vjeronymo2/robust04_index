			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Strong second half helps MMI recover to Pounds 1.21m MMI, which through a series of acquisitions has transformed itself from a sponsorship and financial marketing company into a business communications group, consolidated its recovery at the interim stage with a strong second half, reporting a pre-tax profit of Pounds 1.21m for the year to end-February. The outcome compared with a deficit of Pounds 473,000 last time and was achieved after redundancy and other one-off costs of Pounds 128,000. Turnover rose from Pounds 733,000 to Pounds 14.7m. Earnings per share emerged at 2.05p (2.87p losses). In July last year the company acquired Pelham Communications and its subsidiary, Park Avenue Productions, along with Mediamix, a corporate publishing company. The directors said that Park Avenue had had an excellent year, and made the main contribution to the profit performance. These purchases are to be enhanced by the proposed acquisition of WMGO Group, in connection with which a placing and open offer involving the issue of 25.2m new ordinary 1p shares is being made. Some 11.9m shares have been conditionally placed with institutional investors at 27 1/2 p apiece, subject to an open offer to existing shareholders. On completion of the acquisition it is intended to change the company's name to WMGO Group. Having gained the necessary approvals to reduce its share premium account by the amount of the deficit on the profit and loss account, MMI is able to pay dividends out of profits. Accordingly, directors have declared a special interim of 0.5p for the current year.</p>

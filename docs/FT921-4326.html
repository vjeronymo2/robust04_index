			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / UK News (Employment): Woman manager fights demotion THE MOST senior woman in the marketing department of British Gas lost her job to a man junior to her and was praised for taking the news 'like a man', an industrial tribunal in London heard yesterday. Ms Hilary Williams, who earns Pounds 45,000 a year and was formerly regional marketing services manager for the British Gas south-west region, was the only manager of her grade demoted in a reorganisation over the past two years. All 11 male managers kept their jobs. Ms Williams is claiming sex discrimination. The case hinges on whether Ms Williams' original job was significantly changed by the reorganisation. Guidelines said managers would retain their jobs where those jobs did not change substantially, irrespective of performance. British Gas said the post created by the reorganisation contained an additional information technology element amounting to 30 per cent of the workload. This meant the post could be advertised. Ms Williams's lawyer Miss Sue Ashtiany said the job descriptions drawn up for advertisements before and after the reorganisation were similar and that Mr Peter Barham, who won the post, had no special information technology qualifications. Miss Ashtiany said Ms Williams contested British Gas's view that Mr Barham had done her job better than she did while she was on secondment to British Gas in London. She said that before the reorganisation senior managers had judged Ms Williams as demonstrating good potential for further development. Later, she was described as relying on instinct rather than hard facts. Ms Williams was among British Gas's top 700 managers. She joined the organisation in 1983 after holding jobs in the prison service, local government, an oil company and a management consultancy. The case continues today. A female pool champion will today, at an industrial tribunal in Leeds, accuse the Professional Pool Players Organisation of failing to grant her professional status even though she has won many tournaments.</p>

Where a sponsor organization expands its operations internally, by acquisition or otherwise, the credit union may serve these new entrants to its field of membership if they are part of a group described in Section 5. Where acquisitions are made which add a new wholly-owned or majority-owned subsidiary, the group cannot be served until the subsidiary is included in the field of membership. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Overlaps may occur as a result of restructuring of the parent organization. Credit unions affected by organizational restructuring are required first to attempt to resolve overlap issues among themselves. Once the affected credit unions reach agreement, they must apply to NCUA for a modification of their fields of membership to reflect the groups each will serve. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, credit unions must submit to NCUA correspondence from the parent organization explaining the restructuring and providing information regarding the new organizational structure. To help in future monitoring of overlaps, the organizational structure should identify divisions and subsidiaries and the location and number of employees at each location. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Overlaps may also occur as a result of the parent organization's merger. NCUA's general policy of avoiding overlaps applies to those resulting from corporate mergers as well. Affected credit unions must make every reasonable effort to identify up front and address the overlap issue raised by parent corporation mergers and must attempt to resolve any differences among themselves. In those rare cases which require NCUA's intervention, all attempts to resolve the issues must be fully documented by the affected credit unions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Affected credit unions should consider consolidation (merger) of institutions as a possible alternative to dividing up the field of membership, particularly if safety and soundness concerns exist or future viability is in question. A federal credit union which has a broad based field of membership generally has a better chance of survival when a sponsor restructures or closes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While neutral, NCUA will make the final decision regarding field of membership amendments, taking into account the credit unions' agreements, safety and soundness concerns, the desires of the members, the significance of the overlap and other relevant issues. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NCUA will be flexible when working with credit unions affected by parent corporation mergers and divestitures. Where no other credit union service is available and the sponsor and its employees desire to continue service, NCUA may use wording such as the following: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Employees of XYZ Corporation, formerly a subsidiary of ABC, Incorporated, located in Charleston, South Carolina. .&blank;.&blank;.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> IV.B.3_Overlaps-Exclusionary Clauses <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> This discussion pertains to new and existing charters.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Where two credit unions agree and/or NCUA has determined that an overlap should be avoided, this decision may need to be memorialized in a federal credit union's charter through an exclusionary clause. Examples of exclusionary wording are: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Persons who work for Hilo Sugar Company, except those who work in or are paid from or are supervised from San Francisco, California. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Persons who work for the ABC Co., except those employed by the XYZ Division as of June 30, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Persons who work for the ABC Co., except those who were members of the XYZ Federal Credit Union as of June 30, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Exclusionary clauses are very difficult for credit unions and NCUA to monitor properly. To minimize this difficulty, NCUA generally does not require federal credit unions to apply exclusionary clauses to persons eligible for membership in another credit union simply because they are one of the ``other persons sharing common bond'' listed in Section II.E of this Chapter. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Moreover, if phrased improperly or used in situations for which they are not suited, exclusionary clauses can be ineffective or create obvious inequities_one spouse may be eligible for membership in a federal credit union while the other may not; one employee may be eligible for credit union service while the person working next to him or her may not. For this reason, exclusionary clauses are rarely if ever appropriate for inclusion in a community charter's field of membership as a way to resolve overlap concerns. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> May 13, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LAKER OWNER, RILEY WILL DISCUSS CONTRACT EXTENSION AFTER SEASON  </P> <P> Perhaps responding to rumors that Pat Riley will leave coaching to become a  broadcaster after this season, Laker owner Jerry Buss has begun negotiations on  a contract extension for the Laker coach.  </P> <P> Riley, who has two seasons remaining on the contract he signed midway through  last season, confirmed that an extension was first discussed two months ago.  </P> <P> "It's been discussed, but basically it's an agreement to meet and that's all,"  Riley said Saturday. "It came from Dr. Buss. He wanted to do it. I didn't  initiate it."  </P> <P> Riley said he will not meet with Buss again until after the playoffs, so as not  to distract from the Lakers' play.  </P> <P> "We'll wait to talk," Riley said, laughing. "I trust Dr. Buss' word on it. It's  no big deal."  </P> <P> Riley, along with Chuck Daly, coach of the Detroit Pistons, has been mentioned  as a possible commentator for NBC's coverage of the NBA next season. But Riley  has said that he will stay with the Lakers. SAM McMANIS  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 12 (YONHAP) -- South Korea turned down  Tuesday a North Korean proposal to take delivery of a letter,  rebuffing the suggestion as "turning the other way from the  normal inter-Korean dialogue channel" and "of no help to  improving relations."    Yi Chun-ku, Seoul's liaison officer, phoned his Pyongyang  counterpart Yi Song-tok to say that South Korea will not accept  the letter.    Pyongyang had notified Seoul Monday that it wanted to  deliver  a letter Wednesday addressed to the South Korean Government,  political parties, social organizations and individuals.    Officials here said the letter is believed to ask Southern  figures to participate in a conference on Aug. 15, the 49th  anniversary of Korean liberation from Japanese colonial rule, of  party and social leaders on ending national division.    Unification Board Spokesman Kim Hyong-ki issued a statement  accusing North Korea of attempting yet "another tactic on the  unification front."    "Stop political propaganda which only stirs up distrust and  confrontation among the people," the statement said.    Kim urged North Korea to realize the mood of the  international community and accept nuclear inspections and  resumption of inter- Korean dialogue.</p>

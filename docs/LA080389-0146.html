			<p><P> August 3, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BALLETS TO SPIN FAIRY TALES OF 2 PETERS TONIGHT  </P> <P> Hey, kids, take a tip from a couple of guys named Peter. Obey your folks or you  could end up on the wrong side of a rabbit stew . . . or a tidbit for a testy  wolf.  </P> <P> Tonight at Anaheim's Pearson Park Amphitheatre, two of the most mischievous  Peters in children's literature will offer a twirling, whirling lesson in  obedience in "The Hilarious Tales of Peter Rabbit" and "Peter and the Wolf,"  presented by the Laguna Beach-based Ballet Pacifica. The ballets for children,  which run about 25 minutes each, will begin at 7:30 on the outdoor stage as  part of Pearson Park's annual summer season of entertainment. There will be one  intermission.  </P> <P> According to Molly Lynch, Ballet Pacifica's artistic director, both ballets  feature a traditional but simplified retelling of the classic tales. "Peter  Rabbit" tells of the fuzzy fellow's exploits in Mr. McGregor's garden, where --  despite his mother's warnings -- he lunches on stolen carrots and barely  escapes joining the vegetables in the farmer's stew pot. In "Peter and the  Wolf," a headstrong boy ignores the old folks and ventures too far into the  woods, where he encounters a foul-tempered wolf with an undiscriminating  appetite.  </P> <P> There are a few detours, mostly in the interest of pint-sized sensibilities,  Lynch said. For example, in the original version of "Peter and the Wolf," a  hapless duck is eaten by the wolf, never to be seen again. Ballet Pacifica  gives the duck a reprieve.  </P> <P> "In our version, the wolf swallows the duck whole, but later, in all the  excitement, he opens his mouth so wide the duck just flies out. We didn't want  to upset the kids," said Lynch. Both ballets are appropriate for children ages  3 and older, she added.  </P> <P> Former Ballet Pacifica dancers Dan Berney and Corinne Calamaro created the  choreography for "The Hilarious Tales of Peter Rabbit." The simple but colorful  sets are by Charles Johnston. (Johnston is a busy guy; he also dances the roles  of McGregor in "Peter Rabbit" and Grandfather in "Peter and the Wolf.") Lila  Zali, founder and past director of Ballet Pacifica, created the costumes. The  taped score featured selections by Leo Delibes, the 19th-Century Romantic  composer best known for his operas and ballets.  </P> <P> "Peter and the Wolf" features the familiar score by 20th-Century Russian  composer Sergei Prokofiev. Choreography and costumes are by Zali, with sets by  Tania Barton.  </P> <P> Both ballets were performed in May as part of Ballet Pacifica's 1988-89  Children's Series, a four-part season of children's ballets that began in 1978.  (Tonight's performance is at the invitation of Anaheim's Parks and Recreation  Department.) Next season's Children's Series opens Oct. 28 at Laguna's Festival  Forum Theatre with "Ghouls and Goblins" and a new adaptation of "Puss and  Boots." In March, the company will present a new work based on the tales of  "Winnie the Pooh."  </P> <P> Ballet Pacifica also stages a four-part Concert Series each year for adult  audiences, blending traditional dance with more innovative works. The company  also presents dance lectures and demonstrations to area schools and community  groups through the Center Dance Alliance, a support group of the Orange County  Performing Arts Center.  </P> <P> "I look at our Children's Series and lectures as something that's really  beneficial to the community," said Lynch. "Our Concert Series is very  important, but you have to keep working on the educational element of dance.  You have to strike the right balance."  </P> <P> With most grade-schoolers better versed in Nintendo than Nureyev, does Lynch  have any trouble attracting youngsters to a performance of -- eeek! --  classical dance?  </P> <P> "I think exposing children to ballet at an early age is really important,  whether it helps them develop appreciation of it as an audience member or makes  them want to get involved in it themselves," said Lynch, who, coincidentally,  began her own training under Lila Zali at age 6. "So we try to make our ballets  high quality and somewhat educational."  </P> <P> But that doesn't mean they can't have a little fun too.  </P> <P> "The kids really got into it," Lynch said. "I think it's the combination of  good, classical music, the colors, the costumes, the movement. . . . It's all  attractive to them." Not to mention the audience participation.  </P> <P> "Sometimes a character will go out among the kids, and that's pretty exciting,"  she added. "For example, at the end of 'Peter and the Wolf,' the hunters take  the wolf off to the zoo and they go through the audience. Some of the kids will  scream; others will sit there with their eyes wide open, just staring at him.  </P> <P> "It's so real to them."  </P> <P>  Ballet Pacifica presents "The Hilarious Tales of Peter Rabbit" and "Peter and  the Wolf" tonight at 7:30 in the Pearson Park Amphitheatre. Tickets are $2 for  adults, $1 for senior citizens (over 50) and children 12 and under. Festival  seating. A snack bar is available. The amphitheater is on Lemon Street between  Lincoln and Sycamore in Anaheim. Information: (714) 999-5191.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 13 (YONHAP) -- A senior presidential  secretary said Monday the government favors the imposition of  step-by-step sanctions on North Korea, responding to reports  that the United Nations Security Council is considering adopting  a milder sanctions resolution than originally expected.    The secretary said, "South Korea and the United States have  already agreed on gradual sanctions, and it is wrong to  interpret these gradual sanctions as appeasement or a retreat."    Although the UN resolution would not be strongly worded, he  added, it would involve practical measures against North Korea  rather than carrying only symbolic meaning.    "The UN Security Council also considered the Chinese  position, among others, before deciding its course on adopting a  resolution on gradual sanctions," he said.    Reports that China would give military support to North  Korea  if war broke out on the Korean peninsula are based merely on  rumor, he said.    Russia has proposed an "eight-way conference" to solve the  nuclear problem, but it is not a precondition for Moscow's  participation in sanctions against North Korea, according to the  official.    "I don't think that Russia would oppose the UN Security  Council resolution on gradual sanctions," he predicted.</p>

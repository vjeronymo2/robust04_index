			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / MacGregor pledges 'full speed ahead' for rail sell-off THE GOVERNMENT signalled its determination last night to press ahead with privatising Britain's railways, claiming the plans would create a better service for passengers and freight customers. Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, used a speech to his local Conservative association in South Norfolk to hit back at recent suggestions that the government's proposals were stalled and would have to be revised. Rail privatisation was going 'full speed ahead', he told them. As Labour called on the government to spell out 'how deep is their U-turn', Mr MacGregor said recent criticism of plans for 'commercialising' British Rail passenger services were based on 'complete misunderstandings'. The government was aiming to 'inject into the railways more private sector skills and resources', he said. 'Our proposals will make sure we get that further improvement in service for passengers and freight which is so necessary if we are to get the benefits of the record levels of capital investment currently going into our railways.' Speculation that the government was preparing to back down over its proposals for BR intensified last week following prime minister John Major's characterisation of them as a 'semi-privatisation'. Last year's white paper proposed that only the freight operations would be sold outright. On the passenger side, the private sector would be asked to bid for franchises to operate British Rail's trains, the contracts going to the companies requiring the lowest subsidies. The infrastructure would remain in state ownership, train operators being charged for the use of the tracks. While acknowledging that BR was already carrying out 'important reforms' of the railway system, Mr MacGregor criticised current service standards - particularly in its freight operations. 'I don't find anyone who thinks that BR is providing a perfect service now and does not need further change,' he said. The transport secretary reiterated the government's pledge to continue subsidies for 'socially necessary lines'. He also emphasised that progress towards the planned franchising of BR's passenger services would be gradual.</p>

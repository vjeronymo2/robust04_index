			<p><P> November 6, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEWS;  </P> <P> KRONOS QUARTET PLAYS ECLECTIC PROGRAM AT WADSWORTH  </P> <P> In their usual, sophisticatedly packaged fashion, the Kronos Quartet  demonstrated their ability to successfully take several different kinds of  music and put them together into a consistent, avant-garde program Saturday  night at Wadsworth Theatre. Included in their performance were examples of  ethno-pop, minimalism, Renaissance, rock, blues and at least one established  20th-Century masterpiece.  </P> <P> The latter was Charles Ives Second String Quartet (1913), a last-minute  substitution which became their most daring undertaking. All of the odd  phrases, difficult synchronizations and humorous effects blended expertly into  a thoroughly virtuosic performance.  </P> <P> Equally engaging was the Los Angeles premiere of Terry Riley's "The Gift," a  collection of chant-like passages and patterns inspired by East Indian music.  Riley continues to be the most pleasingly unpredictable of minimalist  composers.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, excessive reverb, unintended distortion and other problems in  the amplification system marred much of the fare.  </P> <P> This was most apparent in the L.A. premiere of Carlos Farinas' graphically  notated "Tatomaite" (1972), in which the ensemble made use of different-sized  gongs, temple blocks, maracas and bongos, all sounding washed out in a sea of  antiseptic reverberation. The Kronos' own arrangement of the Tallis 40-Part  Motet also fell short of expectations due to a prerecorded part that frequently  buzzed and distorted.  </P> <P> Opening the program were three tonal pieces by African composers, two of them  Los Angeles premieres: from Uganda, Justinian Tamusuza's infectious folk tune  setting "Mu Kkubo Ery' Omusaalaba," and from Sudan, Hamza El Din's more  tranquil, Arab-influenced "Escalay." The other work by white South African  Kevin Volans, "White Man Sleeps, Dance 4" (1985), proved more routine.  </P> <P> Two encores of intricate arrangements of rock tunes by Steven Mackey completed  the program. "Foxy Lady" by Jimi Hendrix gave the ensemble a chance to ham it  up while Muddy Waters' slower, more meditative "I'm Your Hoochie Coochie Man"  revealed a less brutal pop sensibility.GREGG WAGER  </P></p>

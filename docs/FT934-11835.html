			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / Property: Rise in capital values offsets fall in rentals The total return on the Investment Property Databank all-property index in September was 1.5 per cent, thanks to a strong rise in capital values which more than offset a cont-inued decline in rental values. The total return on all properties for the third quarter was 3.9 per cent, significantly higher than the first quarter figure of 0.8 per cent and the second quarter's 2.5 per cent. The year to date figure is 7.4 per cent, equivalent to an annualised return of 9.7 per cent, raising the possibility that, if the most recent levels of return continue for the remaining quarter, the figure for the year as a whole will be back in double figures. The strongest sectors in the month were again offices and industrial properties. Yields on offices fell to 9.8 per cent; and on industrial property to 11.1 per cent. For all properties, the yield was 9.6 per cent. For the year to date, the total return on retail properties has been 9.2 per cent; on offices 4.9 per cent; and on industrial properties 7.9 per cent.</p>

			<p><P> December 30, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GRANT TO INVOLVE STUDENTS IN CHARITIES  </P> <P> The James Irvine Foundation has made a $200,000 grant to a Pepperdine  University project that involves students with local charities.  </P> <P> The project places 120 first-year MBA students in volunteer consulting  relationships with nonprofit organizations.  </P> <P> The project "directly impacts the community in a very positive manner," said  Wayne Strom, professor of behavioral science and management. "It serves to help  the respective client agencies operate more efficiently . . . and it allows the  students to get a 'hands-on' experience while still in school."  </P></p>

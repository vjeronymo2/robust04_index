			<p>BFN     [Text] It was reported at a briefing staged by the Interior  Ministry on Tuesday in Moscow that gold and other valuable raw  materials gained by criminals are used to solve definite  political and propaganda tasks. In particular, the funds gained  are invested into the arms business and financing of hostilities  in zones of inter-ethnic conflict. In addition, the stolen gold  and diamonds are accumulated in order "to create a currency  basis for newly created independent state entities."    According to Major General of the Militia Ivan Sardak,  deputy  chief of the Main Department on Economic Crimes within the  Russian Interior Ministry, a tendency for worsening  characterizes the crime situation in the sphere of currency  circulation which may still aggravate in the near future.    Over 1993 the Interior Ministry's services on economic  crimes  confiscated about two billion rubles in foreign currency in the  course of criminal investigation, that is about 20 percent of  all confiscated currency valuables. Over the first quarter of  this year the law enforcement bodies have already confiscated  1,183 million rubles.    In addition, while investigating the cases of robbery of  precious metals and stones, the law enforcement bodies have  confiscated as much as 253 kilograms of gold, 49 kg of platinum,  1900 kg of silver, 2000 carats of diamonds, and other valuables  amounting to 15.573 million rubles.    At the same time the real scale of precious materials  robbery  greatly exceeds the mentioned data because not more than 5-10  percent of the total number of such crimes are exposed by the  law enforcement bodies.</p>

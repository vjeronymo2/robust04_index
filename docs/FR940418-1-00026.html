			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Only one comment was received in response to the December 5, 1988  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  proposed approval of the Kennecott GEP demonstration. The comment was from Kennecott in support of this action. However, prior to publication of the proposed approval  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , EPA did receive a letter from a landowner in the Oquirrh Mountains expressing concerns due to the lack of ambient monitoring in the nonattainment area. This was EPA's first documented information on public access in the nonattainment area other than the Kennecott operation. EPA proceeded to continue its evaluation of the State submittal and to publish its position on the GEP demonstration based on the State submittal, but initiated a reevaluation on land ownership above the 5600-ft. elevation in the Oquirrh Mountains. Documentation on the claim of land ownership, other than that of the Kennecott operations, was provided by Howard Haynes, Jr. in March 1989.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Utah 1981 SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->  and 1986 GEP SIP Reassessment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Data from the Salt Lake County and Tooele County Assessor offices showed over 80 landowners in this nonattainment area. Kennecott, in its land ownership research, verified the list of landowners.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As stated above, one of the critical assumptions of the conditional approval of the 1981 SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  SIP and the emission rate was Kennecott's ownership or control of those lands in the potential nonattainment area in the Oquirrh Mountains. The land ownership research revised the EPA's earlier assumptions on the adequacy of the 1981 SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and the 1986 GEP Stack SIPs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA entered into discussions with Kennecott and the State for resolution of these issues and attempted to outline the procedures for addressing the SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and GEP SIPs. Documentation of these meetings and discussions is found in EPA letters to the State dated July 12, 1989, and August 14, 1989. Since monitoring has been stated as the only method to conclusively determine the attainment status of lands in the Oquirrh Mountain, the State and Kennecott proceeded to develop a monitoring program. Maximum ambient concentration location of the monitors, access to the monitors, and operational logistics of the monitor(s) were key problems identified.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During these negotiations, the State was developing the PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  SIP for Salt Lake County. The Salt Lake County PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  SIP development process identified SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  as a precursor for PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . (Precursors are secondary particles which are formed in the atmosphere from gases which are directly emitted by the source. Sulfates are one of the most common secondary particles in a PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  nonattainment area and result from sulfur dioxide emissions.) The Kennecott smelter SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions comprised  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=2 -->  <!-- PJG 0023 unknown -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 56% of the total (primary and secondary) PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions in Salt Lake County.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  SIP was adopted by the State in August 1991 and submitted to EPA in November 1991. The reader is referred to 57 FR 60149, December 18, 1992, for information on the PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  SIP. The PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  SIP required significant emission reduction for the Kennecott operations (refinery, concentrator, mine, power plant and smelter). The Kennecott smelter emission limits were reduced from 76,000 tpy or 18,000 lb/hr annual average (as allowed in the 1981 SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and 1986 GEP SIPs) to  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=2 -->  <!-- PJG 0023 unknown -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 18,500 tpy (which includes fugitive emissions, and applies to the entire smelter). (The 1981 SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and 1986 GEP SIPs addressed emissions from smelter processing units and SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  collection and removal equipment vented to the smelter tall stack. They did not include fugitive emissions. For clarification, the 76,000 tpy was reduced to the 14,191 tpy limit on the 1215-foot stack for emissions from the smelter processing units and SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  collection and removal equipment).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. The 1991 GEP and 1992 SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->  SIP Submittals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Prior to the State's adoption of the PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  SIP, EPA discussed the uncertainties of finalizing the 1986 GEP SIP with the State and Kennecott. EPA clarified its position on the need for consistency within the Utah SIP with respect to emission limitations at the Kennecott smelter. In a letter dated July 18, 1991, EPA outlined the SIP Revisions that must occur to address the inconsistencies between the 1981 SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  SIP, the 1986 GEP SIP, and 1991 PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  SIP. To summarize, EPA stated that it could not knowingly and legally proceed to approve a regulation and emission limitation that were no longer applicable, or a stack height demonstration analysis based on an obsolete regulation or emissions limitation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In a letter dated December 23, 1991, the Governor of Utah submitted a revision to Section 16, Demonstration of GEP Stack Height, of the Utah SIP. The 1991 submittal was received on December 30, 1991. On February 28, 1992, EPA advised the Governor of Utah that this submittal was administratively and technically complete in accordance with the Federal SIP completeness criteria.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The revisions to Section 16 specify the allowable emission limit for the 1215-foot main stack at 14,191 tons/year as derived in the PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  SIP. This emission limit is based on double contact acid plant technology (which is considered NSPS for the smelter acid plant tail gas), significant capture improvement of fugitive emissions, and improved operation and maintenance. The 1991 submittal also contained a reanalysis of other sources in the State for which stack heights above the deminimus level (65m) were previously reported. (These sources' stack heights were published in 54 FR 24334, June 7, 1989.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

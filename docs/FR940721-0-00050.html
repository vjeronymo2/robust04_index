			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> BMW also disagreed with the agency's tentative conclusion that country of assembly should not be considered in making carline determinations. First, that company argued that the Labeling Act does not prohibit division of vehicles by country. That company stated that given the fact that Congress defined  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> carline <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  as a ``name,'' which is generally assigned by a manufacturer, it believes Congress intended carlines to be established by manufacturers. BMW stated that it believes Congress was attempting to alleviate the burden on manufacturers by giving them the maximum flexibility to group vehicles together, while not allowing completely unrelated vehicles to be incorporated into one set of parts content calculations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> BMW argued that Congress placed the restriction of having ``commonality in construction'' to define the largest grouping by which a manufacturer is allowed to divide its vehicles. According to that company, this portion of the definition was not intended to force manufacturers to group vehicles together but rather to limit the vehicles that could be forced together into a carline. BMW stated that if the Congress had intended to force such a grouping on manufacturers, it would have explicitly defined  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> carline <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  as a ``name denoting a group that shall include  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> all <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  vehicles which have a degree of commonality in construction.'' (Emphasis in BMW's comment.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, BMW argued that information based on a vehicle's country of origin would be the most accurate and understandable to the consumer. That company noted the agency's statement in the NPRM that consumers might be confused if identical vehicles are considered to be in different carlines. BMW argued that this should not be a concern because such differences would provide better and more accurate information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, BMW argued that NHTSA's tentative conclusion directly conflicts with the portion of section 210 that requires the best and most understandable information. That company argued that the latter requirement should take precedence. BMW recommended that, rather than debating such issues as the Congressional intent of the carline definition, the agency should use the definition as worded in the legislation and permit manufacturers to make independent interpretations to achieve this goal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While numerous foreign vehicle manufacturers, including ones in addition to those mentioned above, objected to the agency's proposal to exclude country of assembly as a factor to consider in making carline determinations, several indicated that, if NHTSA did not change that position, they supported the concept of providing additional information on the label concerning such vehicles. Toyota stated that requiring this additional information (or alternatively, allowing a manufacturer to include it on the label on its own option) is preferable to requiring (or permitting) only disclosure of an average percentage for a carline on a worldwide basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Honda stated that such additional information would improve the accuracy of the information provided to the consumer. It suggested the following language:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> This carline is produced in both the United States [or Canada, as appropriate] and [add name of other country]. The U.S./Canadian parts content for vehicles manufactured in the location noted in line three of this label is [ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=7 f=2 --> XX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> ]%. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Nissan stated that if manufacturers are not permitted to separate parts content percentage calculation by production country origin, then each manufacturer should be permitted the option to determine the most appropriate method to provide additional information or explanation of a label's parts content percentages to a potential vehicle purchaser. That company argued that NHTSA should not prohibit the manufacturer from providing additional explanations or require the manufacturer to include generic wording to clarify the U.S./Canadian parts content percentage calculation to consumers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After carefully considering all of the comments, NHTSA has decided that carline determinations may not be based on country of assembly, but manufacturers should be permitted to provide specified additional information for carlines assembled in both the U.S./Canada and another country. In reaching this decision, the agency has focused both on the Labeling Act's provisions related to ``carline'' and on section 210(d)'s requirement that regulations ``provide to the ultimate purchaser the best and most understandable information possible about the foreign and U.S./Canada origin of the equipment of such vehicles without imposing costly and unnecessary burdens on the manufacturers.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In enacting the Labeling Act, Congress decided that the parts content percentages for the U.S./Canada and foreign countries should be calculated for groups of vehicles rather than for each individual vehicle. It also decided to adopt the concept of ``carline'' and its definition from the CAFE program, as the basis for determining the relevant groups of vehicles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

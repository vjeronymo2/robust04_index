			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] New York, Feb 17, (SPA) -- The Kingdom of Saudi  Arabia has demanded that the international community must  undertake all necessary measures authorized by the charter of  the U.N. for implementation of the Security Council resolutions,  overed by Chapter Seventh, permitting use of power to force the  intrasigent Serbian side in compliance to the rules of the  international legality.    Addressing a session held by the Security Council on Tuesday  on the Bosnian situation, Ambassador Jaafar al-Leqani, the Saudi  permanent representative to the United Nation, stated that the  Kingdom of Saudi Arabia had taken an steadfast stand since the  start of the crisis to support the people and government of  Bosnia- Herzegovina and expressed full support for the  resolutions and recommendations made by the London conference,  the United Nations and Geneva talks on the matter.    He called on for implementation of the resolution adopted by  the Security Council on protection of safe havens in the Bosnian  lands and to boost the Bosnian Government's capabilities of  self-defense.    " The Saudi position has been emanated from a strong  commitment and absolute adherence to the attitudes of the  international legality and the international laws and norms." he  said.    He called on the Security Council to undertake all possible  means to implement more than fifty resolution it made on the  Bosnian crisis and said any efforts for a peaceful settlement  should take into consideration equal and fair bases because such  settlement would be useless if the Serbs were allowed to go  ahead with their vicious aggression and genocidal war against  the Moslems of the region.    Ambassador Al-Leqani expressed hope that the international  community would take a serious and rational step towards the  just and legitimate demands of the Republic of Bosnian  Government and make sure that the republic would not subject  again to any aggressive of genocidal policies, give the Islamic  republic a sea outlet and enable her of practicing the  legitimate right of self- defense.    Ambassador Al-Leqani denounced the genocidal war being waged  by the Serbs and their allies against the Moslem population of  Bosni-Herzegovina that led to a tremendous and tragic loss of  lives and displacement of thousands.    He cited with resentment the recent bombardment of a  marketplace in Sarajevo that killed more than 60 people and the  recent Serbian attacks on many of the safe havens declared by  the United Nations.    He said the untold and nefarious acts of the Serbs are  constituting a great insult for the world's conscience.    Leqani recalled the Saudi warning that any failure in  dealing  with the Bosnian crisis on bases of the new international order  would no doublt endanger the very existance and credibility of  that order.</p>

			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / India to hold polls in two 'rebel' states INDIA'S caretaker government and the country's election commission decided yesterday to go ahead with national and state elections in turbulent Punjab and Assam, in spite of vigorous protests from the big political parties. The only concession that was announced was that polling in the two states will not be held at the same time as in the rest of the country, which goes to the polls to elect a new parliament and five other state legislatures from May 20 to 26. Punjab and Assam have long been in the grip of violent insurgencies by secessionist groups. Although militants in Assam have announced they will give up violence during the election, daily killings continue unabated in Punjab, where a number of Sikh groups are backing the demand for an independent nation they call Khalistan. After hearing protests from a delegation made up by four parties - the Congress party, the Hindu revivalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the two Communist parties - Mr TN Seshan, chief election commissioner, announced that polling in Punjab will be held on June 22 and in Assam on June 6 and 8. The decision by Mr Chandra Shekhar, the caretaker prime minister, that elections will be held in all states except Jammu and Kashmir, where secessionist groups have also launched a movement, has been strongly opposed by the main political parties. Most Delhi politicians fear that fair and free elections are not possible in Punjab because of intimidation by the militants. Mr Rajiv Gandhi of the Congress party recently said that if a state legislature controlled by the militants emerged from the elections, an unstable government in New Delhi would not be able to tackle a demand for independence by them. Most of the parties have threatened to boycott the Punjab elections. However, since their demand for the uncoupling of the Punjab poll from elections in the rest of the country has been partly met, it is possible they will review their decision.</p>

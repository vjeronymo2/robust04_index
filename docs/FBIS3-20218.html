The spokesman, who was commenting on a Cyprus radio report  on  the matter during his daily briefing with the press, further  said that the authorities were continuing investigations into  the crime.    Theofilos Yeoryiadhis, 37, president of the Cypriot  Committee  for Solidarity With Kurdistan and a father of three, was shot  five times at close range outside his home earlier this month.    Replying to a remark that the international denunciation of  Yeoryiadhis' cold blooded murder was behind schedule,  Kasoulidhis said it would be accompanied with evidence.    The spokesman also reassured that the Republic's authorities  and the National Guard continue to take all the necessary  security measures to counteract the infiltration of Turkish  intelligence.    Referring to press reports claiming that Turkish Cypriots  who  work in the island's free areas may be spying on the National  Guard, Kasoulidhis said the authorities were aware of certain  activities but were taking all necessary steps.    He said that the government was aware of the existence of a  Turkish occupation service, responsible for electronic warfare,  and was again taking all the necessary measures.    Cyprus has been divided since the 1974 Turkish invasion.  Turkey continues to occupy 37 per cent of the island's areas.</p>

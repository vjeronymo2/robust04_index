			<p>940616 FT  16 JUN 94 / International Company News: Baring backs Cimpor issue Foreign institutions, led by Baring Brothers, have underwritten 47 per cent of a public offer of 20 per cent of Cimpor, Portugal's largest cement producer. The remaining 53 per cent has been underwritten by Portuguese institutions led by Banco Fomento e Exterior, confirming that the state will raise at least Es40bn (Dollars 229m). The offer is seen as a test of investor interest in Portuguese privatisations, ahead of sales of stakes in the telecommunications and power utilities planned for the next 12 months.</p>

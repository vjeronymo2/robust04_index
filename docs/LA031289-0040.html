			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'BENNETT THE DRUG CZAR'  </P> <P> I read with great alarm Bennett's belief that "compelling reasons" should allow  the government to suspend the Constitution, in particular, the Fourth  Amendment. Anyone with even a high school knowledge of history can see the  terrifying parallels throughout history, from ancient Rome to Nazi Germany.  </P> <P> No one can deny there is a drug problem in this country (indeed, the world).  Yet, it seems to me the worse part of this problem is the fascist who wants to  use drugs as an excuse to eliminate our freedoms. Look back over the last 30  years or so. Is there anyone who would really trust our government without the  Constitution as a muzzle?  </P> <P> Bennett said, " . . . You can't destroy the fabric of the country in order to  defend the country." But America is the Constitution. It is what makes our  country free and unique. If you destroy the Constitution, there still might be  a place between Canada and Mexico, but it sure won't be America.  </P> <P> JOHN SHERMAN  </P> <P> La Crescenta  </P></p>

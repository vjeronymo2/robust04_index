			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / Technology: Sega and W Industries become 'virtual' partners Sega Enterprises of Japan, the world leader in coin-operated arcade entertainment, is going into partnership with W Industries of the UK to develop a new generation of games featuring 'virtual reality', or advanced computer simulation. The UK company has become a Sega technology partner along with Martin Marietta of the US, a leading electronics supplier and specialist in simulation and training systems. It will work with Sega on the development of a new arcade game to be launched in early 1994. No details of the new game are being released. The deal is worth Pounds 3.5m over two years to W Industries, followed by a further Pounds 1.3m a year in licensing fees. W Industries has a letter of intent from Sega for further games research. According to Jon Waldern, W Industries chief executive, Sega chose to use the British company's virtual reality system over its own and that of leading US virtual reality suppliers. W Industries, now six years old, is the UK's leading exponent of virtual reality for entertainment. It specialises in 'immersive' virtual reality in which players wear video helmets and sensory gloves to enter an imaginary electronic world. It has recently won an industry award for 'Legend Quest' a dungeons and dragons game installed in the Tower Pageant at the Tower of London. For four players, the game involves a search for treasure through a maze of rooms. Wearing helmets which transmit three-dimensional images of the rooms, the players co-operate in the quest. They 'see' each other as the fictional characters they play. Sega, a leader in computer graphics for entertainment, bucked the trend among Japanese electronics companies this year, returning taxable profits of Y55,000bn (Pounds 342m), up 64 per cent on the previous year. Developments of the kind Sega and W Industries are pioneering are changing the image of games arcades from haunts of bored teenagers to family entertainment centres. Worth some Dollars 9bn (Pounds 6bn) a year worldwide, the electronic arcade business is growing at 18 per cent annually. UK companies including W Industries and Division are among the world leaders in virtual reality.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by the Foreign Ministry; date not given] </F>   [Text] In response to media requests for some reaction to  the statement issued in the name of the PLO Chairman, yesterday  (Tuesday), 24.5.94, in the newspaper "AL-QUDS", the Foreign  Ministry Spokesman has said that the statement is meaningless  and is invalid. The Spokesman noted that, based on the  Gaza-Jericho Agreement, neither Arafat nor the PLO has any  legislative power or authority. According to Article VII of the  Agreement, this power will be granted to the Palestinian  Authority -- once it is established and begins operating in the  field. Even then, legislation must be enacted in coordination  with Israel. Consequently, this statement has no legal  validity. All existing military laws and orders remain in  force, and are binding on all of the parties.    Foreign Ministry Legal Advisor Yo'el Singer adds that from a  legal point-of-view Arafat's statement is a breach of Article  VII of the Gaza-Jericho agreement and that if indeed there has  been any attempt on Arafat's part to change the situation, it  would be invalid. He also noted that 'Oded Ben-Ami, the Defense  Minister's Media Advisor, is of a similar opinion.</p>

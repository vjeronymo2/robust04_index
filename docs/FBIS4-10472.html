			<p>BFN     [Text] A large number of rebels has accepted amnesty after  signing the Overall Human Rights Agreement, and they are now  under the military corps' protection to prevent a possible  attack by subversive factions.    The statement was given by Army Spokeswoman Berta Edith  Vargas de Marroquin, who did not provide additional information  on the number or identity of the rebels who sought amnesty or  their current whereabouts.    She has said the number of URNG [Guatemalan National  Revolutionary Unity] members to be demobilized in September will  be less given the events that have resulted from the latest  agreements signed in Mexico.    They accept the amnesty's legal norms, and the Army is  implementing a special protection plan so they will not be  attacked after deciding to become part of our society, she has  added.    The spokesperson has also said the former fighters were  members of various guerrilla factions, and they have approached  military zone facilities located in different departments of the  country; she added they have provided important information on  their activities.    Marroquin has said: From the military viewpoint, the recent  signing of an agreement, which included the United Nations'  international verification, has made them reconsider their  actions, and the Army is happy about this, because it results in  fewer attacks on society.    The spokesperson also mentioned the URNG's charges that  soldiers executed a peasant in the village of Santo Domingo,  Sayaxche, Peten Department. She categorically denied this,  saying it involved a military clash that occurred on 3 April in  that same place.    She has said a unit from the 21st Military Zone in Coban,  Alta Verapaz, clashed with 10 terrorists at 1300 that day. A  subversive was injured in the clash, and he jumped into the  river, leaving behind his weapon, an AR-15 rifle.    The Army spokesperson has said she did not know the name of  the man who died in Santo Domingo, but she said he had a bullet  wound and later drowned. She has said the military is prepared  to organize a trip to the place so the media can talk with local  residents and confirm the truth.    Referring to Peten, Marroquin has said the Army is still  concerned about the safety of Guatemalans whom the Belizean  authorities have asked to vacate the areas where they settled  along the border. She has said the Armed Forces are ready to act  in accordance with the situation.</p>

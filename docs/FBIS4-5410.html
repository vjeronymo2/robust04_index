			<p>BFN     [Editorial Report] Tokyo NHK General Television Network in  Japanese on 10 April broadcasts at 0000 GMT the "Sunday  Discussion" (Nichiyo Toron) political talk show. This episode  is 130 minutes long, is moderated by NHK commentator Takashi  Yamamoro, and carries separate live interviews with Tomiichi  Murayama, Social Democratic Party of Japan (SDPJ) chairman;  Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) President Yohei Kono; Komeito  (Clean Government Party) Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa, and  Sakigake (Harbinger) representative Masayoshi Takemura, who is  also chief cabinet secretary. Commentator Naoki Tanaka joins the  program as an interviewer.    At 0004 GMT, after introducing the program, Yamamoto starts  interviewing SDPJ Chairman Murayama. When asked if the  successor of outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa should be  chosen from the SDPJ, the largest party in the coalition,  Murayama says, "Before choosing a new prime minister, it is  important to seek an agreement within the coalition through  discussions on the framework or character or policies of the new  cabinet." He adds that it is premature to discuss the  possibility of his being chosen as the new prime minister. When  asked what the SDPJ thinks of Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party)  head Tsutomu Hata, who is foreign minister and is said to be a  hopeful candidate, Murayama states, "Rather than saying that the  SDPJ feels antipathy against Mr. Hata himself, our party,  frankly speaking, feels antipathy against Shinseito's political  methods."    Murayama stresses that the current framework of the  coalition  parties should remain unchanged and thus hold in check the  Shinseito-Komeito move toward creating a new framework, wherein  the two parties said that the ruling parties should share common  policies. He says his party will not join the Japan New Party  (JNP)-proposed parliamentary group called Reform (Kaikaku) which  Shinseito and Komeito are likely to join. Murayama then  reiterates that it is necessary to effect policy coordination  within the ruling parties.    Asked by Tanaka how the SDPJ is dealing with North Korea's  suspected development of nuclear weapons, Murayama replies:  "Because the United Nations has not yet come to a final  conclusion, it is necessary to carry out thorough discussions  before making any decision. Meanwhile, the DPRK should accept  nuclear inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency.  I think it is matter of course that we should not drive North  Korea into a corner by threatening to impose sanctions, and  therefore we should avoid making North Korea become isolated.  However, if it should become unavoidable for the United Nations  to adopt resolutions on taking sanctions, we will have to take  actions in concert with the United Nations. But Japan has its  own limitations, and it is possible for Japan to take action in  accordance with UN resolutions but within its own limitations."  Returning to the issue of the new cabinet, he rules out joining  the new government that will be created mainly by LDP Vice  President Watanabe, Shinseito, and Komeito. The interview ends  at 0020 GMT.    LDP President Kono then takes a seat. Asked how the LDP will  act to deal with the current political turmoil, Kono says: "What  our party has to consider first is how to deal with domestic  economic affairs and the relations between Japan and the United  States. The current Japanese-U.S. relations are at a very  critical stage. The LDP will continue to do its utmost to  correct such a situation." On the domestic front, Kono  criticizes Hosokawa for failing to take initiatives in dealing  with economic issues.    When asked to comment on LDP Vice President Watanabe's  possibly leaving the LDP, Kono rules out such a possibility.  Kono then discusses the LDP's views on a move toward a  political realignment and on the achievements of the Hosokawa  government. He terms Hosokawa's having enacted political  reform-related bills as deserving praise. Asked if the LDP  hopes to return to power by allying with other parties, Kono  notes "under the current situation, in which the new cabinet may  be formed without elections, it is possible to ally with other  parties which share common policies, and we have to seek such a  possibility."    At 0042 GMT, an interview with Komeito Secretary General  Ichikawa starts. When Yamamoto asks how he views the criticism  that the Hosokawa government has been led by Ichikawa and  Shinseito Secretary General Ozawa, Ichikawa answers that the  cabinet is run based on an agreement between the ruling parties.  He says the ties that have bound the coalition partners  together were broken after the political reform bill was  enacted, and he notes there is serious gap in policies between  the ruling parties. On the question of the possible framework  of a new cabinet, he states: "We are very eager to hold frank  discussions with the SDPJ. Although it is important to discuss  who will be the next prime minister, we have a duty to the  people to create a cabinet that can cope with issues which Japan  will face soon or later." He adds, "In fact, our party is tired  of coordinating policies with the SDPJ."    Asked when the ruling parties will decide on a new  cabinet, Ichikawa answers, "Yesterday we agreed to decide on the  new prime minister at a plenary session of the Diet on Thursday  [14 April] or Friday at the latest." In this connection,  Yamamoto asks if there is a possibility of parties allying with  LDP Vice President Watanabe. Ichikawa answers, "I am of the  opinion that Mr. Hata is the most qualified person in view of  maintaining the current framework of the coalition government.  But the SDPJ and Sakigake say they oppose this opinion on the  grounds that the government will be led by Shinseito and Komeito  if Hata is chosen. However, when I ask them to further discuss  the details of the ruling parties' basic agreements to deal with  such upcoming issues as the DPRK and tax reform issues, they say  that this is not necessary and that Komeito is trying to expel  them from the coalition government. I think that if they  continue to reject these proposals, we will then have to choose  another alternative." The interview concludes at 0100 GMT.    Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet secretary and head of  Sakigake, is then interviewed on issues such as the future  political realignment. Asked about the reason for the  deterioration of relations between his party and the JNP,  Takemura says that Hosokawa's favoritism toward Shinseito and  Komeito is the major cause. Asked if Sakigake will join the  JNP-proposed Reform parliamentary group, Takemura answers, "No."  On the issue of a political realignment, Takemura says that it  is now an outdated concept to divide political parties into LDP  and non-LDP parties.    Yamamoto then asks how the framework of the new government  should be constructed and asks whether it is impossible for  Sakigake to get along with political parties or groups led by  Shinseito's Ozawa. Takemura replies: "I do not know. In  addition to our party, within the coalition government there are  parties which are increasingly opposed to Shinseito's manner."    Asked whether his party will support Hata as prime minister,  Takemura says it depends on whether or not the current coalition  partners can make a fresh start. He stresses that now is the  time to break the "dual-power" structure. Asked about his  party's role in forming a new government and the framework of  it, Takemura says, "We will present our proposal at an early  date." The interview ends at 0118 GMT.</p>

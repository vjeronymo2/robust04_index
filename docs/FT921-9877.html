			<p>920210 FT  10 FEB 92 / Bush hint of action against Saddam THE US is seeking ways of stepping up pressure on Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. President Bush is reported to have signed a 'finding' notifying Congress of his decision to authorise covert action against President Saddam, and the administration is also examining how to stiffen the economic blockade imposed on Iraq by the United Nations. Meanwhile, Mr Robert Gates, director of the Central Intelligence Agency, is touring the Middle East on a trip the White House says is 'normal'. Mr Bush declined to comment at the weekend on efforts to oust the Iraqi ruler. 'I've said I'd like to see him out of there. I'll just leave it right there,' he said. Mr Samuel Skinner, the White House chief of staff, said yesterday that Mr Saddam was already under considerable pressure, and would inevitably lose power eventually. "We're not talking about military operations here, we're talking about increasing the economic pressure on him.' The flurry of anti-Saddam activity has, however, aroused scepticism that it is motivated by Mr Bush's embarrassment that the Iraqi president is still in power, a year after the Gulf war and on the eve of the first primaries. The assiduous leaking of the presidential finding, which should normally remain top secret, is viewed as indicating that the administration is more concerned with gestures than with deeds.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of speech by Senate President Firmin Jean-Louis on </F> 15 April; place not given -- recorded]    [Text] Haitian people: There is nothing in the evolution  of the world and events that does not have its critical moment.  The supreme achievement of proper conduct is to know that  moment. Yes, we are experiencing today a very critical moment  in the evolution of the Haitian crisis that calls upon me as  president of the National Assembly -- joint guardian of the  national sovereignty -- to address you so as to sum up the  immediate national political juncture. This critical moment is  marked by a general despondency of the population including all  social strata in view of the complications of a national crisis  that appears unsolvable after 32 months. Now, if everybody --  including without discrimination politicians, soldiers,  shopkeepers, state employees, priests, pastors, teachers,  students, and so on -- is overwhelmed, there is good reason to  ask the question: What really hinders the resolution of the  crisis? This is a pertinent question because the viability of  any community lies first and foremost in its capability to  define its true problems so as to bring true solutions to bear.    Furthermore, this critical moment is marked by a big  confusion knowingly maintained by some and by others who are  defending unavowed interests to the very detriment of the  Haitian national interest. Some are asking for the  implementation of Article 149 of the Constitution, whereas  others are asking for the implementation of Art. 148. But all  of that shamelessly reveals the true elements of the solution to  the crisis, notably the rehabilitation of the Constitution and  of the national sovereignty lying in the universality of the  citizens, normal functioning of the state and reinforcement of  the republican institutions, social healing, national  reconciliation -- conditions essential for recovering social and  political stability and for moving toward the path of economic  progress.    In fact, I say the moment is very critical because -- among  other things -- there are precise deadlines that are approaching  rapidly. The deadlines will test the fortunes and viability of  the Haitian democratic project. The first of those deadlines is  next 9 May, the date when the first legislative session will  reach an end. From then on, the honorable deputies will go on  vacation and will come back on the second Monday of June [13  June], which implies that if -- between now and next 9 May --  the resolution of the crisis has not begun at least in a  decisive manner, we will have only three free months left, that  is from the second Monday of June to the second Monday of  September [12 September] to set up the constitutional measures  and the practical mechanisms aimed at leading to the forthcoming  1994 elections. In this regard, I fully share the concerns  expressed by the president of the Chamber of Deputies, honorable  Deputy Frantz Robert Monde, in his address to the nation this  past 13 April, concerns evoked by myself during several meetings  and discussions with colleague Deputy Monde.    However, I bitterly regret that Deputy Monde decided not as  a deputy or president of the Chamber of Deputies, but rather as  vice president of the National Assembly to solemnly address the  Haitian people and country without having had the kindness, even  the courtesy, to inform the president of the National Assembly.  I bitterly regret that the vice president of the National  Assembly just offered reservations about the latest maneuver of  10 April made by the elected representatives of the contested 18  January 1993 elections assisted by some dissident senators.  Finally, I bitterly regret that the vice president of the  National Assembly labeled this so-called assembly of 10 April  1994 an assembly of senators under the leadership of an illegal  office which the vice president of the National Assembly himself  had labeled a few days before as illegal and illegitimate. From  that moment, the vice president of the National Assembly should  have armed himself with his well-known courage to clearly tell  the nation about the unacceptability by the office of the  Chamber of Deputies of any and all acts coming from this illegal  and illegitimate office. This is what the senatorial assembly  and I, president of the National Assembly, were expecting from  President Monde.    As president of the National Assembly, I must consider all  necessary measures for the realization of the session scheduled  for next 9 May to allow the honorable deputies to go on  vacation. This having been said, it is the duty of each senator  and each deputy to work toward the disentanglement of the Senate  of the Republic. Everybody knows the reasons for this  entanglement are essentially the occupation of the  administrative premises and of the session room by those elected  in the contested 18 January 1993 elections and some dissident  senators and a strong tendency toward physical violence -- which  has been manifested several times -- among most of them. So, as  a responsible leader, I have the right to prevent any and all  situations that might give rise to tragic incidents.    All in all the entanglement of the Senate is the  entanglement  of the parliament, which falls within the scope of the general  entanglement of the country. This can be proved by the fact  that the rare sessions held at the Chamber of Deputies since I  opened the first session this past 11 January have not enabled a  move toward the resolution of the crisis. As president of the  National Assembly, I consider that the efforts of the parliament  will have a real meaning when all of us, senators and deputies,  enter the path leading to an effective way out of the current  crisis. The essential elements binding the parliament directly  in its constitutional prerogatives are the following: a vote on  the law relating to the amnesty, the ratification of the new  commander in chief, and the ratification of a new prime minister.    In this regard, I call on the president of the lower chamber  and vice president of the National Assembly as well as all vital  forces of the nation to join me so we can reach together this  immediate and priority objective. This is why, as president of  the National Assembly concerned with the critical situation the  nation is experiencing, I am duty bound to draw the attention of  the honorable deputies and senators to the fact that it is time  -- yes, I say it is time -- for us to roll up our sleeves and to  show the people who rely on us that we can do great things.  Thank you.</p>

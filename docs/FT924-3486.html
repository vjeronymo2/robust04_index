			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / World Trade News: Japan to lift more trade curbs - Offer due today on opening service industries to competition JAPAN IS due today to present trading partners in the Uruguay Round of world trade talks with a revised offer to open up more than 100 service industries to greater foreign competition. Japanese officials said the move was an attempt to speed the time-consuming country-by-country negotiations on liberalising individual service sectors, which have been slow to get going again since the Round resumed last month. The substance, if not the legal drafting, of each country's initial market-opening commitments on services must be completed by the end of this year if the target set for concluding the six-year-old Round is to be met. An agreed schedule of commitments is a condition for joining the proposed General Agreement on Trade in Services, which will extend fair trade rules to services for the first time. Some 60 countries (the European Community counting as one), accounting for more than 90 per cent of cross-border services trade, have made offers. But Japan's latest is the first to take the form of a draft schedule of commitments. Under pressure from trading partners, Japan has improved its original offer made early this year. In particular, it has dropped two of the six areas initially proposed for exemption from Most-Favoured-Nation treatment. Of the four that remain, the only one expected to come under challenge is that relating to legal consultancy services provided by foreign lawyers, where the US and the EC want Japan to drop reciprocity requirements. Japan has not sought non-discriminatory Most-Favoured-Nation exemptions in financial services, such as banking, insurance and securities business. However, both the US and EC judged the original offer inadequate and last October agreed a joint approach to squeeze better terms out of Japan and other Asian nations.</p>

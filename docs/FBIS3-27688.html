			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed "Roundup": "CPPCC National Committee Promotes </F> International Exchanges"]    [Text] Beijing, February 25 (XINHUA) -- Last year Li  Ruihuan, chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese  People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), paid  official visits to Nepal, India and Pakistan.    His visits marked the peak of increasingly active exchanges  and cooperation between the CPPCC National Committee and  parliaments and mass organizations in other countries over the  past year.    This is the first time for the chairman of the National  Committee of the CPPCC, the largest united front organization in  China, to visit other countries since the founding of New China  in 1949.    During his visits, Chairman Li Ruihuan briefed the leaders  of  the three countries and people from all walks of life on China's  foreign policy, and its multi-party cooperation and political  consultation system under the leadership of the Chinese  Communist Party, promoting exchanges and cooperation between the  CPPCC National Committee and parliaments in the three countries.    Public sentiments overseas confirm that Li's visits  represent  the CPPCC National Committee's dual role in expanding both  governmental and non-governmental exchanges in the diplomatic  area.    Established 45 years ago, the CPPCC National Committee  consists of various non-communist parties and mass organizations  and is considered a creation for enhancing socialist democracy  in China. It plays a significant role in political consultation  and democratic supervision in managing state affairs.    International exchanges held by the CPPCC National Committee  in 1993 were characterized by frequent visits to other countries  by the committee's leaders.    Also in 1993, Ye Xuanping, Wu Xueqian, Seypidin Azizi, Hong  Xuezhi, Hu Sheng and Sun Fuling, vice-chairmen of the CPPCC  National Committee, paid separate visits to Vietnam, Laos,  Thailand, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Syria,  Oman, Qatar and Bahrain.    During their talks with the leaders of these countries,  these  vice-chairmen reiterated China's consistent stand in support of  the just cause of the people in developing countries and  expounded the positions of the Chinese Government concerning the  international situation and regional conflicts.    Furthermore, they also explained to their guests the role of  the CPPCC organizations in a bid to expand cooperation with  parliaments and mass organizations in other countries.    To date, the CPPCC National Committee has forged cooperative  relationships with 46 organizations in 36 countries.    The committee focuses its international exchanges and  cooperation on China's economic construction. Various  subcommittees also try to expand cooperation with economists and  scientists overseas.    For example, while visiting Britain in 1993, members of a  delegation sent by the subcommittee of science and technology  concentrated on learning how scientific and technological  findings were applied to industrial production.    Moreover, they discussed with their British colleagues the  relationship between scientific research and social progress, in  an effort to draw on useful experience to perfect the policy  governing the development of science and technology in China.    Also in 1993, leaders of the CPPCC National Committee  received 250 leaders of overseas Chinese organizations in  Britain, France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, the  Philippines and the United States.    This year the committee will continue to expand cooperation  and exchanges with parliaments in other countries. It will also  organize specialized groups to visit foreign countries.</p>

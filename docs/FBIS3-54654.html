On the eve of the new year I send my best wishes for happiness  and prosperity to everyone, to every family, to every region,  and to every country. The end of the outgoing year and the  results of the Ashgabat meeting of the Commonwealth heads of  state have brought hope that in the interests of our peoples we  can cooperate to mutual advantage.    The first steps in this direction have been taken. Openness,  equal partnership, trust and the preservation of economic ties  will help us overcome the difficulties.    As the new year approaches, everyone imagines peace in their  own way. We in Turkmenistan are concerned not just about our  own problems, but also about problems that arise for our  Commonwealth partners. We are happy at every success of theirs.  Turkmens say that peace and prosperity in the house of your  neighbor are your peace and prosperity. So on this new year's  eve, on behalf of the Turkmen people, I wish all of you peace  and prosperity.    Let the new year bring you happiness, joy, and health. A  happy new year to you!</p>

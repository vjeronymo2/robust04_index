With his call for a rapid enlargement of  the European Union [EU] toward the East, Delors took a very  large step. Ironically enough his call sounded with the echo of  Margaret Thatcher's appeal in her famous Bruges speech. The  great champion of European federalism and his most important  opponent are now strangely in agreement: The former communist  countries of East Europe must be included in the European  structures and the Union must play an important role in this  respect.    Since the fall of communism the "integration" of East Europe  has been an objective which is ritually professed at every  European meeting and then in practice just as ritually ignored.  The former communist countries could not of course stand up to  competition from highly industrialized economies. For this  reason these countries were offered association treaties which  ostensibly arranged their phased membership into the EU, but in  reality said nothing about the criteria for full membership and  a timetable.    The argument that these treaties were the best possible was  dangerous, precisely because it appeared so reasonable. East  European countries wanting to join the Union under conditions  approaching the current economic convergence criteria would have  to double their gross national product before the end of the  century. But, because a large part of the capital stock in these  countries is worthless, sustainable growth would require foreign  investments of some $100 billion per year until the year 2,000.  Everyone knows that this is out of the question. The present  inequality in welfare between East and West cannot be bridged in  such a short time. At the same time both Portugal and Spain,  despite 10 years of full Union membership and high investment  levels, are still relatively poor. Therefore the membership  decision is a political question which does not rest solely on  economic indicators. But just as Portugal and Spain were able  to develop better inside rather than outside the Union, so could  the East European countries.    Ever since it was established, the EU has been based on the  assumption that closer economic links will lead eventually to  more political cooperation, which will prevent future wars in  Europe. The same approach is required for East Europe. This  whole region is in a sort of hibernation. Rather than having  governments representing a social contract which has been  achieved from below, East Europe still has political structures  and constitutions which are imposed from above, and leaders who  are determined to instill their people with democratic  principles. Barring a few exceptions, the first generation of  postcommunist leaders is rightly convinced of the mission which  Europe can fulfill. If their efforts remain fruitless, then  eventually these leaders will probably be replaced by more  sinister politicians.    This logic has never got through to Brussels. The East  Europeans, rather than being warmly welcomed in West Europe,  received a full broadside of protectionist self-interest. In  the short term East Europe's agricultural products are its  strongest export sector. As a European cereals producer, Poland  is second only to France; its potato harvest is as big as the  whole of the EU's put together. Hungary is an efficient meat  producer.    But the EU, where despite the promised reforms half the  budget still goes on the common agricultural policy, was not  prepared to allow the East Europeans to sell their products on  European markets. France even blocked a compromise proposal  under which Hungary, in its first year as an associated country,  would be allowed to export an extra 550 tonnes of beef to the  Union. Last year, the Union decided to make its trade policies  more flexible, but they are still restrictive and arbitrary.  For example, over the last 10 years East Europe halved its  steel production, while the EU member states increased their  steel production by 20 percent. Yet the East Europeans are still  accused of "dumping" their steel on European markets and  punished with high tariffs. The Western leaders spoke of lofty  principles and the bureaucrats in Brussels played their quota  game as before.    A cynical game was taking place behind the scenes. After  the end of the Cold War, France was obsessed with binding the  German giant into a closely united Europe, and until this goal  was successfully reached it vetoed the enlargement of the Union.  The United Kingdom, determined to prevent this, made  impassioned calls for East European membership, above all to  weaken cohesion within the Union. Both countries agreed on one  thing: That the East Europeans themselves played no role. But  what had not been understood in either Paris or London was that  the end of years of ideological contradictions threatened all  European institutions and structures with destruction, both in  the East and West. A union which calls itself "European" will  never be able to maintain itself for long as a club of 12 rich  countries on the western edge of the continent while there are  wars and social collapse in the surrounding countries. The  Yugoslav war was the first warning. The return of the  communists in Poland and increasing unrest in Russia quickly  followed.    But more was necessary to convince some governments that  enlargement is the only option. France and the United Kingdom  can still allow themselves some hesitation. But Germany, which  borders numerous East European countries, cannot. It was  curious how the more Paris did to tie Germany to the West, the  more Germany became concerned about the East Europeans. And  London's appeal on behalf of the East Europeans, no matter how  seriously it was intended, was not taken seriously for a moment  as long as the British, while knowing what they wanted to fight  within the Union, still did not announce their own goals. The  recent comments by Delors indicate that this impasse will be  broken quickly.    In the meantime, the Union has realized that import levies  on  East European goods are unpopular and cannot be maintained in  the long term. Last year's crazy "meat war," proclaimed for  "health reason," was a political debacle for Brussels. Delors  also knows that Germany wants to use its Union presidency -- in  the second half of this war -- to bring about enlargement. And  finally it has got through to the Brussels bureaucrats that  after a painful fight to ratify the Maastricht Treaty and the  endless discussions on monetary union, all Europeans now need a  popular, comprehensible goal. The reconstruction of the  continent by removing the old dividing lines between East and  West meets these needs.    Enough problems remain. Six associated East European  countries could not join the Union overnight. Constitutional  changes to the Union's voting procedures and a new division of  subsidies and resources would be necessary. Long and difficult  debates are ahead, but the time is ripe, because in 1996 the  Union must in any case discuss its constitutional structures.  By acknowledging now that enlargement is inevitable in the long  term, Jacques Delors can have a resounding conclusion to his  presidency. His successor will then have to take care of the  heavy work. And if the new president were to be Dutch, then the  dream of the founders of the European Community would be  completely realized: A European from a relatively small but old  democracy would welcome other small but young democracies to the  family of peaceful European nations -- not from charity, but  because this is the essence of a truly unified Europe.</p>

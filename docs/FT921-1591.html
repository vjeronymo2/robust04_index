			<p>920324 FT  24 MAR 92 / Ukraine plans to sever Russian economic links UKRAINE's parliament meets in closed session today to consider an economic programme that would cut links with Russia and rely on greater self-sufficiency and financial discipline, writes Chrystia Freeland in Kiev. The programme, a copy of which has been obtained by the Financial Times, is the work of Mr Oleksandr Iemelianov, chief of the economic division of the Duma, Ukraine's policy-making body. His plan is characterised by overt hostility towards Russia, warning that Ukraine's economic conflict with its northern neighbour 'threatens Ukraine's very independence'. It was first unveiled to President Leonid Kravchuk last Thursday, and may have fuelled the conflict between Ukraine and Russia at the Commonwealth of Independent States summit the next day. The parliament is expected to decide whether Ukraine opts for the reactionary past, as advocated in the confidential programme, or makes the radical move to the free market and liberal trade championed by Ukrainian reformers. Much will depend on Mr Kravchuk's position. To date, Mr Kravchuk, who prefers compromise to confrontation, has carefully promoted both reformers and conservatives in Ukraine's slow-motion cabinet shuffle. According to a western adviser to Ukraine's government, the fiercely nationalist tone which Mr Iemelianov and much of the leadership have adopted poses the threat of a 'national Communist' regime in Ukraine. Mr Volodymyr Hryniov, deputy chairman of parliament and a leader of New Ukraine, the liberal reformist alternative to the old guard, said: 'I will oppose the programme . . . this direction is very dangerous.' He argues that Ukraine's only salvation lies in outstripping the Russian pace of reform. Mr Iemelianov's programme begins with the accurate assessment that Ukraine lacks a coherent economic vision of its own and has been following Russia's lead. He points to the damage Russia's breakneck emission of roubles has done to the rouble-starved Ukrainian economy. He proposes closing off the Ukrainian economy and 'a complete exit from the rouble zone, and the immediate introduction of our own currency simultaneously with Russian price liberalisation (scheduled for April 1)'. Ukrainian reformers were the first to float the idea of a separate currency. However, today they defer to World Bank and IMF experts, who have warned them that introducing a separate currency before creating a functional central bank and a detailed monetary reform plan would be a disaster. The Ukrainian National Bank, whose chairman, Mr Volodymyr Matvienko, has long been attacked for foot-dragging, is due for an overhaul today.</p>

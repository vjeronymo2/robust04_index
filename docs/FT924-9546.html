			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / International Company News: MAN sees profits for year down from recent peaks MAN, one of Germany's biggest engineering groups and in the last two years a prime beneficiary of German unification, warned yesterday that profits for the year to the end of next June would be down from the record level of the last two years. However, Mr Klaus Gotte, chief executive of the Munich-based manufacturer of trucks to diesel motors, sounded less pessimistic than many of his fellow German industrialists when he said that it would only be in the fourth quarter of the current financial year that the company would face serious uncertainties. Although order intake dropped steeply in the three months July to September  -by 22 per cent in all, as announced last month - the backlog of orders, the company's financial strength, as well as rationalisation measures already under way, ensured that the full year profit would be good enough to ensure the payment of a satisfactory dividend, Mr Gotte said. In its last financial year, the group - via its MAN Nutzfahrzeuge subsidiary, the second-largest German manufacturer of commercial vehicles - reported group earnings up 3 per cent to DM418m (Dollars 267m) on turnover up under 1 per cent to DM19.2bn. Although order intake dropped from DM4.17bn to DM3.25bn in the first three-month period of the current year - because of a 26 per cent fall in domestic orders and a 19 per cent drop in overseas orders - sales dropped by a relatively modest 5 per cent to DM3.8bn. Orders outstanding were 3 per cent down to DM16.31bn. Mr Gotte warned that in the fourth quarter of the year there were 'uncertainties ahead' because of the likelihood that there would be inadequate capacity utilisation. He said that the group had initiated rationalisation measures a year ago in areas of the business not benefiting from the order boom, particularly in printing. He said that by the end of this financial year the number of employees would be down 4,500, or 7 per cent, since the economic downturn began. As announced last month, profits at MAN Nutzfahrzeuge increased by 29.7 per cent to DM255m in the year to the end of June, the company's best performance.</p>

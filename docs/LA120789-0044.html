			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE BASKETBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> SYRACUSE HOLDS OFF DUKE'S CHARGE, 78-76  </P> <P> The calendar read Dec. 6, but Syracuse and Duke made it seem like March.  </P> <P> In a game with the intensity of an NCAA tournament game, top-ranked Syracuse  used David Johnson's two free throws with three seconds to play Wednesday night  to beat No. 6 Duke, 78-76.  </P> <P> The victory by the Big East's Orangemen (5-0) evened the ACC-Big East Challenge  series 3-3 with two games to play tonight at East Rutherford, N.J., including  the matchup of No. 3 Georgetown and 17th-ranked North Carolina.  </P> <P> "It was very intense out there," Syracuse's Billy Owens said. "This was the  all-hyped-up Big East-ACC Challenge. I'll be rooting for Georgetown -- the last  time I ever root for Georgetown."  </P> <P> The game was tied, 73-73, after Christian Laettner made two free throws to  bring Duke (3-1) even with 3:05 to play.  </P> <P> LeRon Ellis then made one free throw with 1:47 left and, after Laettner missed  two free throws with 1:28 left, Derrick Coleman made both ends of a one-and-one  opportunity to give Syracuse a lead of 76-73, the only margin greater than two  points in the final 16 minutes.  </P> <P> Coleman missed a free throw with 39 seconds left, and Phil Henderson made one  of two to get the Blue Devils within 76-74.  </P> <P> Henderson then scored on a drive with 14 seconds left to tie the game after  Syracuse had turned the ball over while trying to run out the clock.  </P> <P> Syracuse called a timeout with 10 seconds left. As Owens was bringing the ball  upcourt he stumbled and appeared to walk but no call was made.  </P> <P> He got the ball to Johnson, who was fouled by Laettner and made both free  throws. Duke had a last chance, but a long jump shot by Billy McCaffrey fell  short at the buzzer.  </P> <P> Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski was impressed by the physical play of the Syracuse  front line.  </P> <P> "I hate to use the word pro," he said. "It's a mature team and they play a good  style for that type of team."  </P> <P> Syracuse Coach Jim Boeheim was one of the few people upset by the intensity of  the game.  </P> <P> "I want to play nine or 10 people and get them ready as much as I can in  December for the conference," he said. "I don't want to get sky-high on Dec.  6."  </P> <P> Krzyzewski had just the opposite reaction.  </P> <P> "To be put in that arena at this time is good for us, and it was good for them,  too," he said.  </P> <P> Stephen Thompson led Syracuse with 21 points, and Owens had 18. Robert Brickey  led Duke with 21 points, and Laettner had 19.  </P> <P> Clemson 72, Providence 71 -- Dale Davis hit two free throws with 14 seconds  remaining and the Tigers survived a last-second three-point attempt to win in  the ACC-Big East Challenge.  </P> <P> After Davis' free throws, Providence's Carlton Screen worked the ball upcourt,  and it wound up in the hands of forward Marty Conlon, whose three-point shot  bounced off the rim.  </P> <P> Quinton Burton hit a three-point shot at 1:38, giving Providence (4-1) a 69-68  lead, but two free throws by Marion Cash returned the lead to Clemson (4-1)  with 1:30 left.  </P> <P> Burton stepped out of bounds going for a rebound, but the Friars turned a miss  by Clemson into another basket by Burton with 24 seconds left for Providence's  last lead.  </P> <P> OTHER GAMES  </P> <P> No. 2 Kansas 86, Southern Methodist 53 -- Terry Brown hit four three-point  shots and scored 14 points to lead the Jayhawks over the Mustangs at Dallas.  </P> <P> Kansas (7-0) trailed only once and had six players in double figures. Mark  Randall, Pekka Markkanen, and Kevin Pritchard had 12 points apiece, and Freeman  West and Mike Maddox had 10.  </P> <P> No. 4 Missouri 106, Hawaii Loa 48 -- The Tigers shot a school-record 75% and  Doug Smith scored 17 points to lead five players in double figures as the  Tigers beat the NAIA's Hawaii Loa at Columbia, Mo.  </P> <P> Missouri, winning its 20th consecutive home game, opened with a 23-4 burst, led  by Nathan Buntin's 13 points. The Tigers (5-0) led, 56-23, at halftime after  shooting 83%. The 75% for the game broke the record of 73% against Iowa State  in 1982.  </P> <P> No. 8 Michigan 100, Central Michigan 51 -- Terry Mills scored all of his 17  points in a first half that saw the Wolverines shoot 56% in beating the  Chippewas at Ann Arbor.  </P> <P> Sean Higgins scored 18 points, Rumeal Robinson had 17 and Loy Vaught 12 for the  Wolverines, who have won four in a row after losing their opening game.  </P> <P> No. 11 Louisville 101, Vanderbilt 75 -- Everick Sullivan scored nine points as  the Cardinals (4-1) opened with a 14-0 run and were never threatened in beating  the Commodores at Louisville.  </P> <P> Sullivan, who scored 13 of his 20 points in the first half, hit two jump shots,  a three-point shot and a slam dunk during the opening spurt, which was capped  by Tony Kimbro's free throw at 14:17.  </P> <P> Louisville's full-court pressure defense forced Vanderbilt to miss its first  eight shots and commit three turnovers before Derrick Wilcox broke the drought  with a jump shot from the top of the key with 13:55 left in the half.  </P> <P> Kentucky 111, Tennessee Tech 75 -- Derrick Miller scored 36 points, including  seven of Kentucky's near-record 18 three-point baskets, in a 111-75 victory at  Lexington, Ky.  </P> <P> Kentucky's three-point baskets was one shy of the record set when St. Francis,  Pa., and Valparaiso each had 19 in games in February.  </P> <P> The Wildcats (3-1) also attempted 41 three-point shots, topping Loyola  Marymount's 39 tries against North Carolina on March 19, 1988.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 3, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MORSE AND EL CAMINO WIN TO COMPLETE THE FINAL FOUR;  </P> <P> 3-A SEMIFINAL: THE TIGERS SURVIVED AN UNEXPECTED SHOWER AND A SECOND-HALF MIRA  MESA COMEBACK TO WIN, 18-13.  </P> <P> As David Gambill lined up to kick an extra point and give Morse a 17-0 lead  late in the second quarter, the Mira Mesa defense was trying to figure out how  to stop the red-hot Tigers.  </P> <P> Proving that there may be something to mental telepathy, the automatic  sprinklers came on and doused both teams before the snap.  </P> <P> But not even a good soaking could cool Morse, which held on to defeat Mira  Mesa, 18-13, in a section 3-A semifinal at Southwestern College Saturday night.  </P> <P> After the sprinklers were shut down, the teams tried again. But a high snap  went through the hands of holder and quarterback Teddy Lawrence, who scrambled  back to the 25 and lofted a pass into the end zone and the waiting hands of  Tommy Bennett.  </P> <P> Morse 18, Mira Mesa 0.  </P> <P> It was that kind of first half for Morse, which advanced to the section final  for the third consecutive year. The Tigers will defend their title against  top-ranked Rancho Buena Vista Saturday at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium.  </P> <P> It was a half the Tigers needed. Mira Mesa rallied in the second half to pull  within 18-13 with 6:49 remaining on a seven-yard run by Wayne Pittman and a  17-yard pass from J.J. Rowlett to Marc Ziegler.  </P> <P> "We tried to push up our lead in the first half," Morse fullback Utotofu Fiame  said. "They just started passing, and our (defensive backs) were getting beat."  </P> <P> Fortunately for Morse, it controlled the first half, and that's all it would  need.  </P> <P> The accidental two-point conversion came after a drive that had the Tigers with  a second and 43 from the Morse 38. But Lawrence, on the run, threw a pass down  the left sideline; the ball bounded off a defender and into the arms of Donnie  Nash, who held on as he fell backwards.  </P> <P> That set up a third and three, and four plays later, Faime pounded through from  the one.  </P> <P> Morse, which scored 14 points before Orange Glen managed a snap in their  quarterfinal, took a little longer this time. But not much.  </P> <P> Lawrence zipped a pass across the middle to David Dunn, who caught the ball at  the 35 and ran untouched into the end zone with 4:32 remaining in the first  quarter.  </P> <P> A nine-yard punt gave Morse the ball on the Mira Mesa 24, but the Tigers  couldn't get a first down, and Gambill kicked a 32-yard field goal to make it  10-0.  </P> <P> Morse scored again on the next drive, although two holding penalties and a sack  gave them the second and 43.  </P> <P> The Morse defense shut down Mira Mesa in the first half, allowing the Mirauders  just one first down and 18 total yards.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 25, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A. SCHOOL BOARD REJECTS STIFFER PENALTY ON WEAPONS  </P> <P> How reassuring to know, as Roberta Weintraub stated, that the Los Angeles Board  of Education is more interested in protecting students who bring guns on campus  than it is in protecting the vast majority of students who do not bring weapons  as well as all teachers, administrators, and all other campus personnel (Metro,  May 8).  </P> <P> The campus police officer at the school in which I teach still remembers with  horror and pounding heart the day, several years ago, when he almost pulled his  gun on a student who was holding what appeared to be a rifle.  </P> <P> The rifle turned out to be a toy gun, but if the officer had pulled his gun in  an attempt to defend himself and students against what appeared to be a real  gun, how many would have been injured or died?  </P> <P> Who are these people who run our school district? How long will it take for  them to ruin it entirely? Does the public care?  </P> <P> ANN BOURMAN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

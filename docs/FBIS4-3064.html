She made these remarks in reply to a question regarding the  apparant private gains made by some sons and daughters of  leading cadres in China through their political power.    Ms. Deng said that everyone knew about the 20-year jail  sentence handed down to a former deputy director of the State  Science and Technology Commission, Li Xiaoshi, and to her  knowledge, Le Xiaoshi was also the son of a senior cadre.

			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GARDENING Q &amp; A  </P> <P> Favorite Rose Blooms Produce Two 'Noses'  </P> <P> Q: Double Delight is my favorite rose in the garden, but the blooms sometimes  turn into two "noses." Is this common, or am I doing something wrong?  </P> <P> A: Double Delight -- which, by the way, is the most popular rose in the country  -- does occasionally produce double-nosed blooms. Some experts think this  condition is caused by overfeeding, so if you're fertilizing heavily, try  cutting back.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Unsterilized Soil to Blame for Gnats  </P> <P> Q: Hordes of little black gnats seem to hover above the soil in my houseplants.  What are they, and how can I get rid of them?  </P> <P> A: Fungus gnats hatch from eggs deposited in unsterilized potting soil. They  become active when plants are kept damp. To get rid of them, try a new diazinon  product called Whitmire Ultra Guard; or you can use Schultz houseplant spray, a  pyrethrum-based low-toxicity insecticide. To avoid these gnats in the future,  use only sterilized potting soil. Mary Ellen Guffey  </P></p>

			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / International Company News: Air Canada continues strong profits recovery Air Canada continued its strong recovery in the second quarter, turning in net profits of CDollars 27m (USDollars 19.5m), or 22 cents a share, up from CDollars 14m, or 19 cents a share, a year earlier. But the 1993 quarter included a special CDollars 46m fuel tax rebate, so the underlying upswing was CDollars 59m. Operating income was CDollars 61m, up CDollars 40m (excluding fuel tax rebate).

Second-quarter operating revenues were CDollars 966m, up 7 per cent from a year earlier, with a 4 per cent gain in passenger traffic and a 4 per cent rise in yield, or revenue per passenger mile. For the first half, Air Canada posted a net loss of CDollars 5m, against a deficit of CDollars 279m, including restructuring charges a year earlier. Operating income was CDollars 49m, against an operating loss of CDollars 12m. Excluding all special items, the improvement in net earnings totalled CDollars 169m and operating income was up CDollars 100m.</p>

			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / Survey of Emerging Markets (20): Edging closer to US standards - Mexico Mexico's financial convergence with the US is forcing its stock market to adopt US practices of accounting, disclosure and financial analysis. The result is the most sophisticated and liquid emerging market in Latin America, but one which can still spring surprises for ill-prepared investors. The financial integration, which is expected to intensify with implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, is having a profound impact on the way Mexican companies manage their businesses. Companies that used to be controlled by one or two families, and could afford to ignore outside shareholders, are now keeping in touch with domestic and international investors, and are highly sensitive to their criticisms. However, the harmonisation is far from complete, and the Mexican bolsa is much more volatile than that of a typically mature market. As was demonstrated at the time of the New Year uprising in the state of Chiapas, daily movements of 5 per cent are not uncommon. For many companies, liaison with investors is already as close as that of the US. 'There is a huge dichotomy between the highly sophisticated Mexican companies quoted on the New York Stock Exchange and what is happening in the economy as a whole where average incomes are only Dollars 4,000 per capita,' says Mr Timothy Heyman of Baring Securities in Mexico City. The main pressure for change has come from Mexican companies that have raised capital internationally, and have sought listings in the US. To attract foreign money, these companies have had to adopt US rules of disclosure, and to accept US focus on short-term earnings performance. American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) of practically every large Mexican company are now traded in New York, while a growing number of Mexican companies enjoy full listing on the New York Stock Exchange - including Telmex, Vitro, Televisa, Dina, ICA, Radio Centro. While some companies have managed the change fairly painlessly, others have found it difficult. Many barely conceal irritation at having to answer to a group of foreign analysts who often show little understanding of the cultural differences between the US and Mexico. Foreigners in turn are still critical about lack of timely information, insider trading, and poor management of investor relations. Foreign investors criticised Cementos Mexicanos, the cement company, for not warning investors it intended to use money from an equity offering to buy two Spanish cement companies, Sanson and Valenciana. Cemex says at the time of the offering it was not planning to buy the companies. Telmex, the largest quoted company in Mexico, is one of the few US-quoted companies without a professional firm of public relations, and occasionally its management's inexperience has created difficulties with international investors. At a conference in New York last June, the company finance director caused the Telmex stock price to tumble after making what he thought were innocuous remarks about low earnings prospects. Investors also complain that information about a company often reaches some participants before others. Mexico's stock market watchdog tightened rules on insider trading last year. It says that it is investigating several cases of participants using privileged information for gain. 'Mexico has the problem of every emerging market. There exists the ability to acquire information ahead of public announcements,' says Jeremy Campbell-Lamerton, managing director of the London branch of Inverlat, a Mexican broker. Most fund managers in Mexico are also stockbrokers, and investors have complained that they shuffle money between mutual funds they run and the stockbrokers' own accounts to the disadvantage of some clients. 'When you are the operator, distributor, evaluator and seller of the fund there is a conflict of interest,' says Mr Carlos de Laborde, general director of Covap, Mexico's largest mutual fund reviewer. The government last December passed new regulations that make it more difficult for fund mangers to buy and sell shares for a mutual fund at less or more than the true market value. Covap, which is an independent body, now evaluates about 140 of the 230 mutual funds in Mexico. Mexico is slowly moving to US accounting standards, says Jorge Mariscal of Goldman Sachs. The latest example is the decision of banks to adopt US rules of evaluating goodwill. Mr Mariscal expects eventually there will be few important accounting differences between the two countries. While Mexican accounting can confuse Americans by expressing numbers in constant terms (ie, eliminating the effect of inflation), this is becoming less important as Mexican inflation falls to US levels. Eventually, Mexico is expected to abandon inflation accounting. For Mexico, the cost of harmonisation with the US is that it is losing control of its own capital markets. Because dealing costs are lower in the US than in Mexico, and liquidity of trading often higher in the US than in Mexico, many foreign investors prefer to buy stocks in New York. The research on Mexican companies by foreign brokerages is considered better than that published by Mexican brokerages, although this is gradually changing. In a recent Institutional Investor poll of foreign money managers, no Mexican broker was among the top five researchers of their own country's markets.  ----------------------------------- EMERGING MARKETS TOTAL RETURN - 1993  -----------------------------------                                    %  ----------------------------------- Baring EM Index              70.81  ----------------------------------- Asia                          101.40 Europe                         69.20 Latin America                  51.93 Argentina                      57.96 Brazil                         83.50 Chile                          38.92 Greece                         28.00 Indonesia                      78.67 Korea                          26.03 Malaysia                      102.51 Mexico                         39.87 Philippines                   165.18 Portugal                       38.90 Taiwan                        103.98 Thailand                      121.27 Turkey                        215.84  ----------------------------------- Source: Baring Securities  -----------------------------------</p>

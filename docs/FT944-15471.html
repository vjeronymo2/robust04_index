			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / International Company News: Apple Computer enjoys a record fourth quarter Apple Computer has turned in record fourth-quarter revenues, boosted by strong sales of multimedia personal computers and its new Power Macintosh models. Earnings picked up significantly as costs declined. Revenues totalled Dollars 2.4bn, a 16 per cent increase over last year's fourth quarter, and the highest quarterly figure in Apple's history. Net income for the three months was Dollars 114.7m, or 95 cents a share, compared with Dollars 2.7m, or 2 cents, in the same quarter a year ago. Apple said quarterly unit shipments exceeded 1m computers for only the second time in its history. Mr Michael Spindler, president and chief executive officer, attributed the increase to strong demand for multimedia versions of its Macintosh computers, notebook computers and its new Power Macintosh desktop computers. Strong demand has led to a shortage of some of these products, Apple said. During the quarter Apple shipped more than 250,000 Power Macintosh personal computers and upgrades, bringing the total to more than 600,000 units since the products were introduced in March. The company has set a goal of shipping 1m Power Macintosh personal computers and upgrades in the first 12 months. Apple said its earnings improvement was the result of strong revenue growth combined with higher gross margins and lower operating expenses. Gross margins improved to 27.2 per cent of net sales, compared with 25.7 per cent in the fourth quarter of 1993. Operating expenses declined to 19.6 per cent of sales, from 25.4 per cent, and represented one of the lowest operating expense ratios in Apple's history. For the full year, revenues were Dollars 9.19bn, a 15 per cent increase over fiscal 1993. Net income was Dollars 310.2m or Dollars 2.61 against Dollars 86.6m or 73 cents. Included in the company's results for fiscal 1993 was a pre-tax charge of Dollars 320.9m for restructuring and other expenses. Fiscal 1994 results include a pre-tax gain of Dollars 126.9m related to a reduction in the company's estimates of restructuring costs.</p>

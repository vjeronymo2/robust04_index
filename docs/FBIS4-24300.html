			<p>BFN     [Text] Cape Town June 28 SAPA -- The chief of staff of  Umkhonto We Sizwe [Spear of the Nation, MK -- ANC armed wing],  Siphiwe Nyanda, has been appointed acting chief of staff of the  South African National Defence Force [SANDF] with the rank of  lieutenant-general. He is one of nine senior MK officers whose  placement in top positions in the integrated SANDF were  announced by Minister of Defence Mr Joe Modise on Tuesday [28  June].    He said the curriculum vitae of officers from the PAC's  [Pan-Africanist Congress] armed wing, APLA [Azanian People's  Liberation Army], were still being examined, and that the SANDF  placement board would decide on where they should be  accommodated.    The former chief of the Transkei Defence Force, Major  General  T T Matanzima, had been appointed general officer commanding  Eastern Province, with the same rank.    Other appointments were (SANDF ranks): chief of Service  Brigade: Lieut-Gen Lambert Moloi; chief of personnel SANDF  headquarters: Major-Gen Andrew Masondo; chief of Army Staff:  Maj-Gen J Tshali; chief director of logistics SANDF  headquarters: Maj-Gen A Ismail; deputy chief of staff  intelligence: Maj-Gen P Tshikare; commander of SA [South  African] Army Command: Maj-Gen N Ngwenya; director inspections  with special responsibility for human resources and women's  rights: Brigadier J Molefe.    Brigadier M Motau had been assigned to military  intelligence.    Mr Modise said the men were MK stalwarts who had held  command  for many years. Their ranks were based on their experience and  their contribution to the democratic transformation in South  Africa.    Mr Modise also confirmed the positions of the present chiefs  of the Army, Air Force and Navy, Lieut-Gen J H Pretorius,  Lieut-Gen J Kriel and Vice Admiral R C Simpson.    Other appointments -- including chief of staff intelligence  -- would be made as the integration process proceeded.    Mr Modise said Gen Nyanda's appointment would be made  permanent after he had completed a training course over the next  three years or so. There had been bitter complaints from the  public and within the defence force about the standards of the  non-statutory forces, and the SANDF was "accommodating these  complaints".    "We are going to empower our people to enable them to hold  these jobs and acquit themselves in a manner in which we would  like them to acquit themselves," he said.    Chief of the SANDF General Georg Meiring said he was "quite  happy" with the appointments.    He expected the personnel of the SANDF to swell to about  120,000 over the next year with the incorporation of the  homeland and non- statutory forces. This would then be  rationalised over a period of three years back to the present  "affordable" 91,000.    Asked about the former head of the National Peacekeeping  Force [NPKF], Brig Gabriel Ramushwana, Mr Modise said the senior  appointments announced on Tuesday were not all those that had to  be filled. "So when we reach him a decision will be taken and an  announcement made," he said.    The now-disbanded NPKF had been worth it in the sense that  it  was meant for a good cause. "They never had a chance really," he  said. "It was originally planned to train them for nine months,  but in effect they were trained for eight weeks."    The issue of MK members being turned away when they tried to  join the SANDF was a very serious one. The lists that had been  drawn up as stipulated in the constitution would be looked at  again. "Constitutionally there was a cutoff date, but we are  doing everything we can to bring them in."</p>

			<p>930903 FT  03 SEP 93 / Heineken hopeful on recall losses HEINEKEN, the Dutch brewing giant which was last week forced to recall 3.4m beer bottles after the discovery of flaws, was yesterday at pains to stress that damage to its sales, profits and brand name would be strictly limited. Immediate costs of the recall, which was triggered by fears that a production fault in the bottleneck could cause small glass chips to fall into the beer, would be limited to 'several tens of millions of guilders', managers said. It added this sum was likely to be recovered by year's end. In Paris BSN, which is the French parent of the Dutch company which produced the bottles, said that no legal action had been taken against it, or its Dutch bottling subsidiary. BSN added that discussions were being held with Heineken to determine what compensation might be paid. The French company said that in any event the bottling factory and BSN were covered by insurance. Heineken results, Page 22</p>

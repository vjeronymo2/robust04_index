			<p><P> March 23, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> RECOUNT DOESN'T AFFECT RACE  </P> <P> A recount Wednesday by Redondo Beach election officials failed to change the  outcome of the March 7 City Council contest in District 4, in which no  candidate gained a majority. Candidates Valerie Dombrowski and Terry Ward will  face each other in the May 16 runoff.  </P> <P> The recount added one ballot to Dombrowski's column, leaving her with 468 votes  -- still three short of the 50%-plus-one total that she needed to avoid the  runoff and be declared the winner. Ward lost one vote in the new tally, and the  total for the third candidate, Barry Ogle, remained the same.  </P> <P> Deputy City Clerk Linda Gregory said Ward lost a vote when election officials  discovered a miscount in one precinct's absentee ballots. They gave another  vote to Dombrowski when the hand count turned up one ballot that had not been  tallied by a computer March 7, possibly because a loose speck of paper had  blocked a hole in the ballot card, she said.  </P> <P> Gregory said Dombrowski, who requested the recount, will be billed $180 to  cover the costs. The races for mayor and for the District 2 council seat will  also be decided in the May 16 runoff.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Marta Salomon] </F>   [Text] Brasilia, 8 Jun (AE) -- Fernando Henrique Cardoso,  presidential candidate of the PSDB-PFL-PTB [Brazilian Social  Democracy Party-Liberal Front Party-Brazilian Labor Party]  coalition, today contended that he has a copyright for the  economic plan, and that he does not intend to separate his  presidential campaign from the new currency, the real. Upon  being informed that he will be served notice by the Superior  Electoral Court (TSE) about his using the economic plan in his  electoral campaign, Cardoso angrily said: "They have no right  to take that away from me." TSE Judge Flaqquer Scartezzini sent  the notice to Cardoso's apartment. Cardoso will have to answer  the charge in five days.    Before even reading the notice, Cardoso said: "They are  exaggerating." Showing disbelief about the TSE proceeding on  the basis of a charge made by Deputy Carlos Lupi (Democratic  Labor Party-Rio de Janeiro), he said: "The court is not going  to do that." Lupi is asking the TSE to declare Cardoso  ineligible on grounds of abusing his authority and using the  economic plan for electoral purposes. Lupi contends that  Cardoso set the timetable for the economic plan to suit his  electoral interests.    Cardoso said: "I feel hurt." He charged that "they should  instead be chasing the thieves operating in areas where the  justice system is faltering." He added: "This is hard to  believe. A Stalinist regime is going to be reinstated here."    As of this afternoon the campaign command of the  PSDB-PFL-PTB  coalition has not yet received an official notice. This court  action threatens to undermine Cardoso's main campaign strategy.  His allies are indeed seeking to strengthen his links with the  economic plan and with declining inflation rates. "I am the  father of the idea. They cannot say that Fernando Henrique  Cardoso has nothing to do with the real," he said.    PSDB President Pimenta da Veiga contends that "one cannot  overlook the biography of the author of the plan." He added:  "An absurd attempt is being made to separate Cardoso from his  plan, to which he is closely linked." PFL leader Luiz Eduardo  Magalhaes (Bahia State), who is a member of the campaign  political command, said: "Cardoso is the author of the plan, and  can claim his copyright."    In the opinion of Cardoso's allies, the first concrete  results of the fight against inflation will in early August  cause the PSDB candidate to leap forward in the opinion polls.  Cardoso's political command does not concede the charge that  the date for implementing the new currency was moved up to suit  Cardoso's electoral interests. Cardoso has not denied, however,  that he has kept in close touch with the economic team and with  President Itamar Franco, who openly works for his presidential  candidacy.</p>

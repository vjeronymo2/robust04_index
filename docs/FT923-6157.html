			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / Too little, and perhaps too late: As the London conference on Yugoslavia gets under way today, Judy Dempsey assesses the slim prospects for peace As officials in London were putting the finishing touches to preparations for the Yugoslavia peace conference, the people of Sarajevo yesterday launched another desperate attempt to break through the four-month siege of their city. Today - when Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, United Nations secretary-general, and Mr John Major, British prime minister, acting as president of the European Community, open the conference - inhabitants from several other towns and cities in Bosnia-Hercegovina, most notably the eastern town of Gorazde and the northern city of Bihac, will be trapped inside Serb-imposed blockades. As diplomats and politicians talk, fighting continues. The question is whether the conference has the political will or means to bring peace to the Balkan peninsula where there are no winners, only losers. None of the republics has emerged unscathed. The tiny alpine republic of Slovenia, invaded by the federal Yugoslav army in June 1991, can no longer cope with the refugees fleeing from war-torn Bosnia. Nor can its small economy thrive in the short term without finding new markets in western Europe. More than 60 per cent of its trade was with its former Yugoslav partners; telecommunications, road, and railways have been destroyed outside its borders. Independent Croatia is in worse shape. Not only is it home to more than 450,000 refugees, mostly from Bosnia, but a third of the republic's territory is controlled by Serbs. Although the Serb-held areas formally have the status of a UN protectorate, the likelihood of Zagreb regaining full jurisdiction over Croatia remains slim. Serbia, despite its territorial gains in Bosnia, can hardly claim any victory in its war of expansionism. Mr Radovan Karadzic, head of the Serbs in Bosnia, and President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia, rule over devastated lands, their economies in ruin either through mismanagement or sanctions. In Serbia itself, more than 500,000 refugees have placed the republic's infrastructure under an insupportable burden. Above all, the Serbs are virtually isolated on the diplomatic front, and humiliated. This humiliation has almost suffocated what few democratic voices existed in the republic. But while they have no power at the moment, some diplomatic support will have to be extended to them if they are to shape the future of Serbian political life. Though everyone is a loser, the Bosnian Moslems have lost most. Unlike Bosnia's Serbs or Croats, the Slav, Sunni Moslems have no ally in the former Yugoslavia to protect them. Croatia and Serbia have capitalised on this weakness by conspiring to divide Bosnia between them. Today, Croatia de facto controls a swathe of territory in western Hercegovina, while Serbia controls nearly 70 per cent of Bosnia, stretching from the east to the north and across to Krajina, western Croatia. For their part, the Moslems, who comprise more than 43 per cent of the 4.3m population of Bosnia, have been sandwiched in a little area around Sarajevo. Their attempt to take control of this land forms part of their efforts to break through the Serb-imposed siege of Sarajevo. The few liberal voices - academics, economists and journalists - in Croatia, Serbia, Bosnia and in the other republics of the former Yugoslavia, repeatedly argue that the plight of the Moslem population must take precedence over other issues at the London conference. They argue that without upholding Bosnia's present borders and restoring a government which represents the three ethnic communities proportionally, the international community risks fanning the flames of war into other parts of Yugoslavia. This is because Macedonia, in the south, and the south-western Serb-controlled province of Kosovo, share to some degree the same dilemma as the Bosnian Moslems. Independent Macedonia, still unrecognised by the EC, has no protector within the former Yugoslavia, nor have the ethnic Albanians of Kosovo. Like the Moslems in Bosnia, who have appealed to the Islamic countries for financial and military assistance, both might look outside to defend themselves. Fear of the conflict spreading provides impetus to the London conference's attempt to get all the ethnic groups of the Balkans around the negotiating table. But what practical steps towards ending the war can it take? 'The first thing western governments must do is to guarantee and recognise the inviolability of borders within the former Yugoslavia,' said Mr Zarko Puhovski, a sociology professor at Zagreb University. 'But there is no point in doing this if we are not prepared to address the whole question of ethnic and minority rights.' Western diplomats suggest that the twin principles of inviolability of borders and respect for ethnic rights would entail: Croatia and Serbia renouncing all their territorial claims to Bosnia, and Serbia renouncing its claims to Croatia. That the Croat, Serb and Moslem communities in Bosnia, and the Serb minority in Croatia, be granted ethnic and political autonomy, with institutions reflecting the size of their respective populations. This means that any future Bosnian government must be given back the territory seized by both Croatia and by Serbia - at the moment, a principle which can be nothing more than unrealistic. How this can be achieved, and how the tens of thousands of refugees can be allowed back to Bosnia, may call for some military force, as well as economic reconstruction aid from western governments for the refugees who have no homes to which they can return. Serbia restoring autonomy to the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, which Mr Milosevic snatched away in 1990.  If Serbia is demanding ethnic rights for its minority in Croatia and Bosnia, it must extend the same principle to the Albanians of Kosovo, to the Moslems of Sandjak in southern Serbia, and to the Croat and Hungarian minorities in the Serb-controlled province of Vojvodina. In practice, implementing the twin principles will prove almost impossible as long as the fighting continues. Moreover, the EC, and the UN have so far shown that they are neither militarily, nor politically, prepared to protect current borders, or to address the principle of minority rights. This apparent unwillingness on the part of the west to act has deepened the hatred between the ethnic communities. EC diplomats, and military specialists in London for the conference, argue that peace in the Balkans based on the two principles needs external political, economic and military pressure from western governments to succeed. 'Even if the conference talks about protecting borders, and protecting the minorities, and closing down the vile detention camps, you have to set up mechanisms, even military ones, for preventing the Serbs from continuing their policy of ethnic cleansing, and holding on to the land they have grabbed,' said Mr James Gow, a Yugoslav specialist at the Centre for Defence Studies at King's College, London. Dutch diplomats have no illusions about the tasks facing western governments. 'We have to start from the premise that there are no democratic institutions in most of the former republics which could help guarantee any ethnic or minority rights,' a Dutch diplomat explained. 'The rule of law, western rationalism, and ceasefire agreements, carry no weight among the men in Bosnian countryside who are terrorising the innocent civilians.' He said the liberal voices of the press in Serbia, except Vreme (the Belgrade-based weekly) have been censored; Croat liberals are regarded as traitors by the government when they demand rights for the ethnic Serbs in Croatia; Serbs are pilloried for defending rights for the ethnic Albanians; the media reinforces ethnic hatred and suspicion throughout the republics. It seems impossible that the conference can contain or solve such a degree of ethnic tension in the short term. Its critics have been vociferous in denouncing its limitations. Yet despite current scepticism EC diplomats do have a blueprint for establishing ethnic rights for all the ethnic minorities throughout the former Yugoslavia, as well as guaranteeing the inviolability of the current borders. The document, the Treaty for the Convention, was discussed in The Hague on November 5 last year during an earlier EC peace conference session. It envisages, where necessary, the establishing of international monitors to oversee the implementation of the twin principles. All the presidents of the six republics signed, with the exception of Mr Milosevic, the linchpin of any future agreement. 'I think we did have a basis for future negotiations. OK, we knew the president of Croatia (Franjo Tudjman) could not be trusted. We were getting used to the lying and the deceit, especially from the Serbian side. But I still believe that this document did, and will, be used, in the future as a plan upon which the status of the ethnic minorities can be based,' a senior Dutch diplomat said. 'If we do not implement these principles, and more importantly, if we recognise that Bosnia is finished, we will set a precedent for redrawing all the borders agreed after 1945,' he said. He cited a few examples - the borders between Romania and Moldova, Slovakia and Hungary, Hungary and Transylvania - to show how a Third Balkan War would consume other parts of Europe. But will such principles be enough to persuade the Serbs in Bosnia to stop the fighting? 'We have acted too little, too late,' an EC ambassador said. 'The EC went into Yugoslavia without any military force behind it. We could have defended Sarajevo airport. I still believe a show of force could have limited the killing. Now we are scrambling around.' He added that the international community had nothing to show for all its peace-keeping efforts in Yugoslavia. 'It is time the London conference demonstrated we are now prepared to defend our principles. Otherwise, we will become losers as well.'</p>

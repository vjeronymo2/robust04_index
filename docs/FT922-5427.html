			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / Bush agreed aid to Saddam in 1989 PRESIDENT George Bush authorised military and economic assistance for Mr Saddam Hussein 10 months before Iraq invaded Kuwait, according to newly declassified documents made public in Congress yesterday. The documents, made public as part of the continuing investigation by the House Banking Committee of the Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL) Iraqi loans scandal, include National Security Directive 26. This was an order directing US aid to Iraq as a way to moderate Mr Saddam Hussein. It was signed by Mr Bush on October 2 1989. The politically charged hearing yesterday also disclosed documents showing that Commerce Department officials last year altered 68 US export licences to Iraq to remove references to military uses. The political fall-out for President Bush of yesterday's hearings remains uncertain. But the disclosures come just days before the House judiciary committee is to begin hearings on whether to seek the appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate the administration's alleged involvement in the BNL affair and the arming of Iraq. Congressional Democrats led by Mr Henry Gonzalez, chairman of the House banking committee, appear to believe their investigation is gaining momentum. The tone was set yesterday when Mr Sam Gejdenson, chairman of a House foreign affairs subcommittee, termed Mr Bush's 1989 directive 'a foreign policy blunder of the first order'. The directive said: 'as a means of developing access to and influence with the Iraqi defence establishment, the US should consider sales of non-lethal forms of military assistance, eg training courses and medical exchanges, on a case-by-case basis'. The president did include a caveat in his executive order which stated that the Iraqi leadership should be made to understand that any illegal use of chemical or biological weapons would lead to economic and political sanctions. The altering of US export licences to Iraq was made as the data was prepared for submission to a congressional inquiry, according to a memo to Mr Robert Mosbacher, former commerce secretary. The memo, dated June 4, 1991, was from Mr Frank DeGeorge, inspector general of the commerce department. The memo to Mr Mosbacher claimed, however, that with the exception of changes to five licences for 'vehicles designed for military use', the changes were 'inconsequential'.</p>

Data for completion of Form OCP&hyph;101 may be obtained by random sampling providing that in every instance, the universe sampled is all shipments delivered under your common carrier authority (excluding Government, Freight forwarder, and Interline traffic) during the report year or all claims arising out of the transportation of those shipments that were received or settled, as appropriate, during the report year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. When random sampling is used, the minimum sample size in every instance shall be 400 shipments or claims, as appropriate, in replicates of 100 shipments or claims each. All samples must conform to standard deviation with a 95% confidence level.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Carriers submitting Form OCP&hyph;101 shall retain and make available for review by an authorized Commission employee all working papers, notes, and other files relating to the preparation of each report for a period of not less than 24 months following the date of filing such a report.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4.

The total should agree with total 1st proviso shipments reported in your ICC Annual Report, Schedule 600, Line 7, Column d, if you are required to file that report.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> Part B  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> It is not necessary to complete Part B if the total of C.O.D. shipments reported on Part A, Line 1, did not equal or exceed 100 shipments.

As with non-binding estimates, the charges here are determined after the shipment has been picked up and weighed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Line 7: Sum of Lines 4, 5, and 6.

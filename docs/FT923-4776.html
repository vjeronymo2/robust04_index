			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): No revelations on the cards The problem with credit cards is that banks and retailers can build up detailed dossiers on customers without their knowledge or permission. The latest smart cards, incorporating computer cryptography, allow items to be bought or cash withdrawn without the bank or retailer knowing details of each transaction. The card, which contains a microchip, keeps a tally of expenditure and lets the owner authorise every transaction using a personal identification number. The new cryptographic security feature is based on extended 'public key' techniques and incorporates a scrambler to separate bank from customer and customer from store.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Four Serbian aircraft have been shot down by U.S.  F-16 fighters today near Banja Luka in northwestern Bosnia, in  keeping with a UN Security Council resolution that forbids any  and all flights in the skies over Bosnia, according to a NATO  military spokesman.    This is the first time NATO planes have opened fire in  Bosnia, after the Serb planes ignored the F-16s' orders to land.  NATO planes have been patrolling Bosnia daily since April 1993,  with a view to enforcing respect of UN Security Council  Resolution No. 816, which forbids any and all flights in Bosnian  airspace, according to the spokesman.    Meanwhile, a spokesman for the UN High Commissioner for  Refugees [word indistinct] said all humanitarian flights to  Sarajevo have been suspended, as has all movement toward areas  controlled by the Serbs.</p>

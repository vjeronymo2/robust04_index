			<p><P> March 9, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> CHINA TO HELP BOOST OIL PRICES  </P> <P> China said today it will cut oil exports by 5% in the second quarter of this  year to help boost world oil prices.  </P> <P> The official New China News Agency quoted Zheng Dunxun, head of the state oil  trading arm, China National Chemicals Import &amp; Export Corp., as saying the  move was designed to help the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries  restore prices to the group's target of $18 a barrel.  </P> <P> Technical experts from China and five other oil-producing nations outside OPEC  proposed at a meeting in London last month to try to bolster prices by  tightening output. The five other non-OPEC producers are Egypt, Oman, North  Yemen, Mexico and Malaysia. The Soviet Union, which attended the London meeting  as an observer, said last Friday it is cutting its hard-currency exports by 5%  in the first half of 1989 to support the price strategy.  </P> <P> China did not give a precise target for the second quarter, but it exported 26  million metric tons of oil -- about 162 million barrels -- in all of 1988, a  drop of more than 4% from the previous year.  </P></p>

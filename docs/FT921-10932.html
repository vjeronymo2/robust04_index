			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Poor high street trading leaves Menzies at Pounds 2.1m SHARES IN John Menzies fell by 31p to 429p after the Edinburgh-based retail and wholesale group said the recession continued to reduce margins and restrict profits. Turnover rose by 8 per cent to Pounds 489.3m but trading profits fell from Pounds 6.7m to Pounds 4.5m in the six months to October 31. Pre-tax profits were Pounds 2.1m compared with Pounds 200,000 last time, when there was an exceptional loss of Pounds 4m in the Hammicks Book Wholesaling business. The group said trading conditions were particularly poor in the high street, where the core John Menzies Retail business reflected the depth of the recession. Mr John Menzies, chairman. said: 'A return to satisfactory results must await the end of this recession and the more buoyant rates of growth which it will bring.' The second-half results would include the important Christmas period, when sales were broadly as expected, although trading conditions generally remained poor and margins continued to be under pressure. In the UK, the Early Learning chain recorded significant volume growth against general market trends. In the US, Early Learning had shown sales increases above trends in the depressed retail sector. The US business is still for sale, but the group said the prospect of attracting external investor finance would have to await recovery in the retail and venture capital markets. Although the performance of Early Learning in the US is much improved, it is still incurring losses. These are covered by a Pounds 15.2m extraordinary provision, which the group took in 1990, and which has almost been exhausted. Mr Ranald Noel-Paton, managing director, said the group would decide at the year end whether to make a new provision or to take in the results of the business above the line. John Menzies Wholesale, which handles newspaper distribution, and TBD, which is a wholesaler in home entertainment, continued to increase market share. Earnings per share fell to 0.9p (losses 1.4p) and the interim dividend is lifted to 3.6p (3.4p).</p>

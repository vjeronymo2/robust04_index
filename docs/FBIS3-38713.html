In a statement prior to his meeting in Ankara with (Enest  Drakovic), Bosnian minister of education, science, and culture,  Cetin said that representations have been made with NATO and the  United Nations following the recent Sarajevo attack in a bid to  put an end to this barbarism as soon as possible. Cetin said  the following:    [Begin Cetin recording] Our ambassador has been instructed  to apply to NATO, and the application has been made. Turkey was  the first to apply to NATO to call the NATO Council to a meeting  on the issue. Instructions were also given to apply to the UN  Security Council on the issue of lifting the arms embargo. [end  recording]    In reply to a question, Cetin said that he does not believe  that UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali's approval is necessary  concerning any decision NATO might make regarding intervention.    (Drakovic) said that during his contacts he observed that  Western countries do not want to exert efforts to end this  massacre. Pointing out that Turkey's continued support  strengthens the Bosnians, (Drakovic) added that grief caused by  Saturday's [5 February] attack can be seen on the faces of the  Turkish people.</p>

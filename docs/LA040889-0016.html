			<p><P> April 8, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOMETHING MISSING FROM MICHIGAN WIN IN NCAA PLAYOFFS  </P> <P> Michigan won the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. championship by overcoming  the added pressure of going through the basketball playoffs with an assistant  coach.  </P> <P> But in all the TV hoopla, there was no mention of Bill Frieder, the coach who  brought them there.  </P> <P> Mike Downey really captured the situation in his column the morning after. Can  you imagine the agony Frieder had gone through the last few weeks? And to have  to watch the final in a hotel room on TV? I was awfully disappointed to hear  not one word from Steve Fisher crediting Frieder with any contribution to the  success of the Michigan team when Fisher accepted the trophy.  </P> <P> The real heels are the Arizona State group who forced Frieder to sign under an  unrealistic deadline.  </P> <P> Such a bittersweet win for Michigan.  </P> <P> BOB FUJII  </P> <P> Cerritos  </P></p>

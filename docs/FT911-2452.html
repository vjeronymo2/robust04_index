			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / Survey of Singapore (7): A revolution in the wings - Simex: faces tough choice over financial futures trading SIMEX, the little financial futures exchange has weathered obstacles and dire predictions of failure to survive six tough years. However, 1991may prove to be its watershed year. For the first time since the heady days of exponential growth, the Singapore International Monetary Exchange last year failed to improve on annual volume. For the last time, it will have to choose - to join Globex, a force that may change financial futures trading, or risk being left out of the revolution. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) was Simex's partner in pioneering the world's first mutual offset trading system. As the first step to 24-hour trading, it allows a trade opened on one exchange to be closed on the other and be treated as a single transaction. It aids CME to have its products traded in the Asian time zone and elsewhere, and allowsSimex to tap into the CME's large liquidity. All this may change if Simex chooses not to join Globex, the screen-based electronic dealing system co-founded by CME and Reuters which matches futures orders around the world, around theclock. It furthers the CME's aim to deliver its products in the Asian time zonegeographically and during the proper time of day and is expected to operate outside the CME's trading hours. Any money manager or trader with a telephone line can use the system to transact futures contracts in currencies at any time. Globex's 24-hour global reach, with quotes on an estimated 250,000 screens worldwide, and swift execution of trades, may make the CME-Simex mutual-offset moot. 'Once Globex goes into operation, you may not need the mutual offset system,' says Mr John Gelderman, CME chairman. If Simex opts to join Globex, CME still has a problem juggling its membership in both systems. Simex is sanguine about Globex. 'With technology, the whole trading system may be different - there could be a mix of automated trading and open outcry (where buyers and sellers trade in person with shouting and hand signals). I don't think you could launch a new contract with automated trading,' says Mr Francis Yeo, its chairman. Of the four contracts under mutual-offset, the CME says the Eurodollarinterest contract has worked well, but not currency futures contracts in yen, D-Marks, and sterling. Mutual offset trades have dropped to 10,000 contracts a day, some 25 per cent of Simex's overall volume, against 35 per cent in earlier years. Meanwhile, Simex has other worries such as trading volume falling for the first time since futures trading started in 1984. The 5.72m contracts recorded in 1990 was 8.8 per cent lower than 1989's 6.37m contracts, a victim of lower price volatility in the first half-year. 'The falling volume was a global phenomenon,' notes Mr Yeo, who points to a 9.1 per cent jump in the first quarter of 1991 of 1.4m contracts against 1.3m in 1990. The lift in trading was due to extended trading hours from the end of January after the Gulf War bombing began. This move was made to capture the European business, one of Simex's targets, and it appears to have succeeded. An extra 30 to 70 minutes of trading between January 28 and March 2 raised trading volume by one-third, Theincrease came from contracts in Eurodollar and Euroyen interest rates and High Sulphur Fuel Oil (HSFO), which account for some 87 per cent of Simex's volume. Europe interests Simex because the market still has a lot of scope to be tapped and it will be the cause of more financial products with European demand. The exchange introduced a 3-month interest rate futures Euromark contract, its second in D-Mark, and identical to the one offered by the London International Financial Futures Exchange. On the plus side for Simex are an increase in its global share in trading volume. 'Its Eurodollar dollar futures accounts for 8.8 per cent of the world volume against 2.9 per cent in 1985,' says Mr Yeo. The exchange will introduce contracts to diversify and to compensate for its less popular products. Currency contracts did not become Simex core products because of a very efficient cash market; the moribund gold contract stayed that way as the loco-London market was very efficient and quite entrenched; the Dubaicrude contract did not take off due to fear of volatility and because liquidityhad not been fully developed, particularly as it was the first cash-settled energy contract in Asia Pacific. New contracts to augment its successful High Sulphur Fuel Oil contract are most likely in gas oil and Brent crude. In the pipeline are long-term interest rate contracts, 10-year bonds, US Treasury bonds. In the longer-term, an Asean stock market index futures contract. The local stockmarket index is a non-starter until all outstanding matters have been resolved. The main challenge to Simex will be the application of technology to futures trading which will change trading globally. Globally, most exchanges are successful in domestic contracts but in Singapore's case, Simex had to take a quantum leap because the domestic market was small. However, it has the advantage of being an international financial centre, an Asian-dollar base, and the CME link-up.</p>

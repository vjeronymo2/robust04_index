Some  70 armed Serbs took over the bridge across the Sara river  linking Stara Gradiska in southern Croatia to Bosanska Gradiska  in northern Bosnia, Marcotte said.    The Nepalese were negotiating with the Serbs and had called  for reinforcements from a Jordanian battalion, he added, but  referred to the incident as "fairly minor" with no direct  incidence on the war in Bosnia.    The spokesman was not able to say if the Serbs came from the  self-proclaimed Krajina Republic in Croatia or the similar  self-declared Serb Republic in Bosnia.    But the Croatian Serb news agency ISKRA monitored in  Belgrade  said the bridge had been seized by a unit of Krajina's "special  police."    It said the bridge was a "means of UNPROFOR pressure on the  Serbian people of Western Slavonia (in north-central Croatia)"  and quoted the head of the "special police," Krsto Zekovic, as  saying that his men would take over all points on the border  between the two self-proclaimed Serbian republics guarded by UN  troops.</p>

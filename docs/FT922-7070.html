			<p>920520 FT  20 MAY 92 / Bank notes optimism over recovery: The Quarterly Bulletin cautions that the revival is likely to be slow CAUTIOUS optimism is back in fashion in Threadneedle Street. The Bank of England in its latest quarterly bulletin says: 'The prospects for recovery now appear better than for some time.' It warns, though, that prospects are 'by no means uniform throughout the economy, and the pace of recovery is likely to be slow, depending on the course of the world economy and the impact of domestic and international financial fragility'. Although the Bank believes output in Britain fell slightly in the first quarter, it has taken heart from a recent recovery of business and consumer confidence and the better mood of financial markets since the election. Together with the May 5 cut in bank base rates to 10 per cent from 10.5 per cent, 'these developments are encouraging and herald the prospect of an end to recession,' it says. But the report also makes clear that much remains to be done if the UK is to have as successful an economy as many of its rivals abroad. For that reason, the Bank lays great emphasis on Britain's fulfilling the convergence criteria of the Maastricht Treaty on economic and monetary union by 1996, when the European Community is due to discuss the possible move to the third and final stage of Emu. The Bank expects the present counter-inflationary stance will enable the UK to meet the Maastricht terms on inflation and interest rates, but it has doubts about the government's capacity to bring the ratio of the general government deficit to the GDP from about 5 per cent at present to the Maastricht level of below 3 per cent by the 1995-96 fiscal year. The ratio of government debt to national income is likely to rise until 1995-96, which the Bank says would be the longest such rise for about 40 years. Achieving the 3 per cent ratio 'will require firm control of public expenditure'. The government should therefore set 'a credible medium-term target for public spending and borrowing'. The Bank also urges greater efforts to lower inflation. It warns that direct comparisons of consumer price trends between the UK and its EC partners can be too flattering. It says that there is 'no room for complacency' over earnings trends, even though average earnings growth has moved more into convergence with that in the UK's partners in the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System. 'Continued downward pressure on costs will be essential', especially if Britain is to make the most of export opportunities. Here, too, there is some additional cause for worry. Strong exports helped to support output through much of the recession, but weakness in overseas markets is 'now contributing to the uncertainty surrounding the strength and timing of recovery' in Britain. The pace of recovery will depend far more on progress in easing personal and corporate debt burdens and developments in the property market. The Bank notes that the fall in interest rates from 15 per cent in October 1990 'has not yet significantly strengthened confidence.' The personal sector continued to increase its savings in the first quarter while its gross income gearing ratio - the measure of households' gross interest payments as a percentage of disposable income - was still high at 13 per cent at the end of 1991 compared with its 1990 peak of 14 per cent. The Bank suggests that falling house prices were one factor explaining the public's muted response to lower interest rates. House repossessions were another concern. The commercial property market is also likely to remain depressed as premises are completed and add to existing excess supply. The Bank notes that office rents fell by more than a fifth up to the end of 1991, while one estimate puts the drop in rental values for all properties in the City of London at 38.9 per cent last year. Corporate defaults have caused the banks greatly to increase their provisions against bad debts. But the Bank says risk asset ratios remain well above internationally agreed standards and there is no sign that bad debts are causing banks to curb their lending.

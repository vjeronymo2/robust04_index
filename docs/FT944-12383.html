			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / Yeltsin sacks general in probe General Matvei Burlakov, deputy Russian defence minister and the centre of press and political allegations of massive corruption in the Western Group of the armed forces which he had commanded until September of this year, was sacked by President Boris Yeltsin last night. The presidential decree said that Gen Burlakov, 59, had been fired 'to preserve the honour of the Russian armed forces and its leaders . . . in connection with investigations which are currently in progress'. The sacking comes two weeks after the murder of a young journalist, Dmitry Kholodov, who had been investigating the allegations of corruption and had already published details of it. The move puts in doubt the future of Gen Pavel Grachev, the Russian defence minister, who had strongly defended Gen Burlakov and refuted the allegations of corruption.</p>

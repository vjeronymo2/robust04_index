			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Review of West Virginia's Submittal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The State of West Virginia's redesignation request for the Charleston, West Virginia area included information and documentation sufficient for EPA to determine that the five requirements of section 107, noted above have been met. Following is a brief description of how each of these requirements has been fulfilled. Because the maintenance plan is a critical element of the redesignation request, EPA will discuss its evaluation of the maintenance plan under its analysis of the redesignation request. A Technical Support Document (TSD) has also been prepared by EPA on these rulemaking actions. That TSD is available for public inspection at the EPA Regional Office listed in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  section of this document.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Attainment of the Ozone NAAQS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The submittal contains an analysis of ozone air quality data which is relevant to the maintenance plan and to the redesignation request. Ambient ozone monitoring data for 1989 through 1991 show attainment of the ozone NAAQS in the Charleston, West Virginia area. See 40 CFR &sect;50.9 and appendix H. The State of West Virginia's request for redesignation included documentation that the Charleston, West Virginia ozone nonattainment area has complete, quality-assured data showing attainment of the standard over the most recent consecutive three calendar year period. Therefore, the Charleston, West Virginia area has met the first statutory criterion for redesignation to attainment of the ozone NAAQS found at section 107(d)(3)(E)(i) of the Act. It is important to note that EPA has also reviewed the ozone data monitored during the 1992 and 1993 ozone seasons in the Charleston area and determined that no violations of the standard were monitored during those years. Therefore, there have been no violations of the ozone standard monitored in the Charleston area since the 1988 ozone season.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Meeting Applicable Requirements of Section 110 and Part D  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As previously stated, EPA fully approved the State of West Virginia SIP for the Charleston, West Virginia area as meeting the requirements of section 110(a)(2) and part D of the 1977 Act. The amended Act, however, modified section 110(a)(2) and, under Part D, revised section 172 and added new requirements for all nonattainment areas. Therefore, for purposes of redesignation, EPA has reviewed the SIP to ensure that it contains all measures that were due under the Act as of November 13, 1992, the date the State of West Virginia submitted its redesignation request.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2.A. Section 110 Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although section 110 of the 1977 Act was amended in 1990, the Charleston, West Virginia SIP meets the requirements of section 110(a)(2) of the amended Act. A number of the requirements did not change in substance and, therefore, EPA believes that the pre-amendment SIP met these requirements. As to those requirements that were amended, See 57 FR 27936 and 23939 (June 23, 1993), many are duplicative of other requirements of the Act. EPA has analyzed the SIP and determined that it is consistent with the requirements of section 110(a)(2) of the Act. It contains enforceable emission limitations, it requires monitoring, compiling, and analyzing ambient air quality data, it requires preconstruction review of new major stationary sources and major modifications to existing ones, it provides for adequate funding, staff, and associated resources necessary to implement its requirements, and requires stationary source emissions monitoring and reporting.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2.B. Part D Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Before the Charleston, West Virginia ozone nonattainment area may be redesignated to attainment, it also must have fulfilled applicable requirements of part D due as of the date of the State's redesignation request. Under part D, an area's classification indicates the requirements to which it will be subject. Subpart 1 of part D sets forth the basic nonattainment requirements applicable to all nonattainment areas, classified as well as nonclassifiable. Subpart 2 of part D establishes additional requirements for nonattainment areas classified under table 1 of section 181(a). The Charleston, West Virginia ozone nonattainment area was classified as moderate. (See 56 FR 56694, codified at 40 CFR 81.347). Therefore, in order to be redesignated to attainment, West Virginia must meet the applicable requirements of subpart 1 of part D_specifically sections 172(c) and 176_as well as the applicable requirements of subpart 2 of part D_due as of the date of the State's November 13, 1992 request for redesignation. EPA interprets section 107(d)(3)(E)(v) to mean that for a redesignation request to be approved, the State has met all requirements that applied to the subject area prior to or at the time of the submission of a complete redesignation request. Requirements of the Act that come due subsequently continue to be applicable to the area at those later dates (see section 175A(c)) and, if the redesignation of the area is disapproved, the State remains obligated to fulfill those requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2.B.1. Subpart 1 of Part D_Section 172(c) Provisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under section 172(b), the section 172(c) requirements are applicable no later than 3 years after an area has been designated as nonattainment under the Act. EPA has determined that these requirements were not applicable to ozone nonattainment areas on or before November 13, 1992_the date the State of West Virginia submitted a complete redesignation request and maintenance plan for Charleston. Therefore, the State of West Virginia is not required to meet these requirements for purposes of redesignation. West Virginia has, however, completed and submitted a 1990 base year emissions inventory for its ozone nonattainment areas (including the Charleston area) in accordance with EPA's guidance. It is also important to note that upon redesignation to attainment, the preconstruction new source review requirements for prevention of significant deterioration (PSD) would apply in the Charleston area. EPA approved West Virginia's PSD SIP program on April 11, 1986 (51 FR 12517).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

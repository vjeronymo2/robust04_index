			<p>930903 FT  03 SEP 93 / Technology: Microwave mixer zaps hot spots - Worth Watching Recent reports on microwave cooking have highlighted the problem of hot spots - parts of the food can be boiling hot while others remain cold. The Micromix, developed by Sales Connection Group, of London, stirs the food during cooking, thereby eliminating the problem. The gadget has a rigid plastic frame which wedges against the sides of the oven and from which a spatula is suspended into the bowl of food. A friction mat between the bowl and the turntable ensures that the bowl turns evenly as the spatula stirs the food. Sales Connection: UK, 081 902 8800.</p>

			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Minding Your Own Business: Accounts in speedy detail - Computing YOUR sales invoices contain the details of everything you have ever sold, your purchase invoices contain the details of everything you have ever bought. Recently I looked at the new type of sales and purchase ledger packages which, when you enter an invoice, aim to capture all that vital sales and purchase information in the greatest possible detail, enabling you to build up sales and purchase history databases. The new ledger packages allow you to store and display far more information for each invoice. A listing of all invoices on an account will give an entire history of everything you have sold to that customer, which before would have been impossible. To record sales and purchase invoices in this detail demands a lot of disk space. It is only with the advent of unlimited disk storage that this has become feasible. The potential is exciting, but as hundreds or thousands of records build up in the sales history and purchase history, the problem arises: how do you find your way around all this data? Suppose, for example, you have 20,000 transaction records on your sales history. One thing you will want to do is to find, quickly, one particular record. This facility, sometimes called 'serial number/batch tracking' is essential for companies who must be able to keep track of everything they have ever sold, such as computer companies, or drug manufacturers. If you wanted to find out which customer purchased that Deluxe Spoon, serial number 123456, and when. It would be a long job to call up those 20,000 records one by one and try to find it yourself. The computer can do the job for you by means of a 'string search'. You simply ask it to search through the all the records, and find any record where the Description field contains the character string '123456'. For a 20,000 record file this might take about 30 seconds. Apart from finding individual records, you need to analyse the information in the sales and purchase history. Anyone who has ever had experience of a large database on computer will know that the key to analysing it is to be able to sort and search by reference to codes. The more codes you have attached to each record, the better. The new ledger packages handle this neatly. When you first want to do business with Hotel XYZ, you must set up their account details in the sales ledger. It invites you to fill in not only their name and address but certain codes such as account code, area code, salesman code and so on. Similarly, when you set up a new product record for Deluxe Spoons, you fill in not only the description and price but also codes such as product number, and price category. As each invoice line is entered on to the ledger, the computer automatically retrieves the codes associated with this customer and this product, and adds them to the newly created sales history record. So, without any effort on your part, all the records in your sales history are automatically coded by salesman, area, price category and so on, ready for you to make your enquiries. You simply tell the computer: 'Find me all the spoon sales made to anyone in the hotel industry in the north-west of England in the first six months of 1992.' Obediently it zips through 20,000 records and comes up with the six that meet these criteria. All in 10 seconds flat. There are a only a few of these new ledgers on the market, most introduced during the last 12 months. In my last column I mentioned Business Manager, a budget range package from Pegasus, a bargain at Pounds 299. This creates the sales and purchase histories but does not transfer the codes from the customer and product records. One of the new packages which does code the history records is Sequel, a mid-range package developed by the ex-boss of Pegasus. Sequel can be ordered by telephone: 08015-466.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Iraqi Turkoman Party Refuses To Be </F> Dragged Into Conflicts in Northern Iraq"]    [Text] London, AL-HAYAH -- The Iraqi Turkoman National  Party has called for the withdrawal of the armed militias from  residential areas in northern Iraq and emphasized the need for  "a return to the language of dialogue and rejection of the  language of arms," and it refused to be dragged into the  conflicts.    A statement sent by the party to AL-HAYAH said that attempts  have been made to attack the party's offices and buildings,  including "the cowardly attempt which targeted the Society in  Aid of the Poor, which is attached to the Turkoman Party,  committed by people whose identity and party affiliation were  known." It mentioned the killing of Rushdi Tahsin, member of  the party's Irbil Committee and member of the Administrative  Committee of the Turkoman Human Rights Organization, and party  member Ahmad Junbaz and his son Mustafa. It requested that the  implications of the crime be exposed.    It maintained that "the collapse of authority and  administration in the region" as a result of the fighting  between the parties of Jalal Talabani and Mas'ud Barzani -- the  Patriotic Union of Kurdistan and the Kurdistan Democratic Party  -- had "resulted in anarchy and lawlessness endangering the  lives of the population." It added that tension persisted in  the areas under the control of the two parties and that "the  Turkomans, led by the Turkoman National Party, intend to pursue  a peaceful democratic course in the struggle for the achievement  of freedom and democracy in Iraq. All the cheap ways of trying  to divert them from these principles will fail.... The  Turkomans will remain outside the conflicts and disputes despite  all the attempts and plans to involve them."</p>

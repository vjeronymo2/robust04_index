			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / Generators 'may be forced to give away electricity' ELECTRICITY generators may be forced to give away power or even to pay people to take it if generating capacity continues its present hectic rate of expansion, according Oxford Economic Research Associates. The bizarre prospect is raised in a report, published today, that calls for a fundamental review of the regulation of the electricity industry and its impact on investment. The report says that the rush of new entrants into the generating business since privatisation might be damaging. Most new projects have to run all the time to be economic and are on fuel supply contracts that oblige them to take fuel whether they need it or not. The result might be a situation in which generators are forced to bid zero or even negative prices to sell into the pool where electricity is traded. Low pool prices will encourage large users to purchase short-term, which will further undermine the development of an orderly contract market. The study blames booming capacity on the failure of the pool to provide the right price signals, and lack of clarity from the electricity regulator. It also warns that consumers will eventually have to pay more for electricity because of the high cost of the new gas-turbine generators which are driving out old coal-fired stations. The report concludes: 'There is a real danger of volatile swings in investment, detrimental to electricity customers'. Generation in the 1990s: Electricity capacity and new power projects.

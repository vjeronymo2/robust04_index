On his return today, Mr. Yordanov said the delegation had  been received by top state officials, Kuwait's Amir Shaykh Jabir  al-Ahmad al-Jabir al-Sabah, Crown Prince and Prime Minister  Shaykh Sa'ad al-'Abdallah al-Salim al-Sabah, and the speaker of  the National Assembly. He said the Bulgarian MP's had been  warmly greeted at the Kuwaiti Parliament.    They all stressed the significant role played by Bulgaria  and  the democratic forces in particular in support of Kuwait's cause  during the Iraqi aggression, Mr. Yordanov said.    Asked by BTA whether Kuwaiti businessmen were ready to  invest  in Bulgaria, Mr. Yordanov stressed they were showing interest  but Bulgaria had to remove certain obstacles. "We are the ones  who lack a successful policy of attracting foreign investment,"  he said.    Mr. Yordanov pointed out the sides had reached full  understanding over the entry into Kuwait of more Bulgarian  engineering and construction firms, as well as of food makers.</p>

			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Running fast but still fourth / Asda's continuing programme for recovery THE MARKET'S reaction to Asda's rights issue yesterday, pushing the shares up 3 3/4 p to 67 3/4 p, shows how far the food retailer has come in a short time. When the previous chairman and chief executive, Mr John Hardman, left the company in the summer of 1991, many thought that the only hope for the group was a takeover. And few could think who the saviour might be given the depth of the problems. Yet now stockbrokers are pushing up profit forecasts and looking for the shares to rise yet further. To be fair, the shares are still below the level they stood at when Mr Hardman left. So the new management team, headed by Mr Patrick Gillam and Mr Archie Norman, has more to do. However shareholders who took up the last rights in October 1991 - a 9-for-10 issue at 35p - or who bought the shares when they touched 23p last August, are feeling pleased with themselves. Unlike the last issue, which came close to flopping, yesterday's 3-for-10 offer at 53p a share seems likely to be taken up enthusiastically. The two issues, plus asset sales, will have cut group debt from more than Pounds 900m when Mr Hardman left to about Pounds 100m net. Borrowings currently stand at Pounds 448.5m. That answers one of Asda's problems, the need to rebuild the balance sheet. It was severely strained in 1989 when Asda bought 60 Gateway stores from Isosceles, the group which took Gateway over in a leveraged deal, for Pounds 705m. According to Mr Norman the final cost of that acquisition, which he said should never have been made, will approach Pounds 1bn after adding the costs of integration and refurbishment. The next problem is how to use balance sheet strength to address the trading problems. At first, Mr Norman admitted, the cash would be gathering interest awaiting future spending. 'We can finance (capital spending) this year and next from trading,' he said yesterday, 'but in three years time the business would be getting smaller.' He added that the time from buying a site to opening a store is two or three years, so the group must now look to financing spending in 1995. Asda has a legacy of 'first generation' superstores in its north of England heartland. Many were converted from warehouses, factories or mills. They do not stand up well to competition from new stores opened by rivals. It must revamp, resite or rebuild these stores in order to protect the large market shares it has in its traditionally strong areas. Mr Norman added that at the same time it must win back its reputation for offering value for money to ordinary working people and their families. The launch of an 'Asda Price' campaign last autumn, and work on improving ranges is already bearing fruit, he claimed. Trading is ahead of expectations with like-for-like sales growth accelerating. Asda did better than the industry average over Christmas, he said, and when J Sainsbury launched its January sale Asda prices were still significantly lower. Now he is beginning to attack the property issue. The revamp of a store at Wolstanton, Stoke, in September last year, has more than paid for the Pounds 2m cost with a 20 per cent increase in sales. This store, said the company, would 'provide the basis for a store format which could be applied to the renewal of the core Asda superstore chain'. Mr Norman admitted that a few months trading from one revamped store was 'early days for hard evidence', but he believed there was enough to carry on with the programme, and in any case 'the alternative is to wait until it's too late'. As well as revamping stores, Asda plans to resite about 15 of the oldest ones at a cost of between Pounds 12m and Pounds 20m each, and rebuild five to 10 stores on existing sites, costing about Pounds 9m each and involving closing the stores for about eight months. Asda is also experimenting with a discount store format called Dales. With four open so far, all conversions of 'burnt-out' Asda stores, sales have risen sufficiently to offset the lower margin they achieve. Mr Norman said there was still more experimentation to be done, and agreed that the formula of a discount store on an edge-of-town site had never been tried in the UK before. He took encouragement from successes of similar stores in the US. Between the Wolstanton Asda and the four Dales shops, he said Asda had 'the basis for commercially viable formats which, as they are further enhanced, will be rolled out'. At the moment, shareholders seem happy to go along with Mr Norman's view. Profit forecasts stretch up from between Pounds 135m and Pounds 140m pre-tax for the current year, to Pounds 180m or Pounds 190m next and perhaps Pounds 240m or more the year after. That progression would suggest the shares have further to rise. But there is also a note of caution to be sounded. Holding fourth place in an industry with three highly competitive leaders, the task of transforming the business cannot be as simple as Mr Norman's confidence might make it seem. 'He might be right,' concluded one analyst, 'but it's high risk'.</p>

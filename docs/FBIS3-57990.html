			<p>Language: <F P=105> Finnish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Referendum Choices"] </F>   [Text] When the negotiations on membership in the European  Union (EU) are concluded, Finland will have two choices: to say  either yes or no to membership. There are no intermediate  choices. Like the other countries, we have been promised that a  referendum on the matter will be organized here too. If voters  were also offered an "I can't say" choice, perhaps neither of  the principal choices would receive a majority vote and the  outcome could be interpreted in any way one likes.    The law governing the procedure for a referendum that is at  present in effect constitutes a problem. It requires that the  voter be given the opportunity to state that "he does not  support any of the choices offered." The committee that has been  studying the referendum is coming to the conclusion that voters  must be afforded the opportunity to abstain. But then the chief  question to arise is how abstentions are to be taken into  account.    An abstention means that the voter either does not take a  stand on the question or leaves it in the hands of the  decisionmakers. The abstentions may add up to a very large  number if they are given equal weight as a third choice.  According to the government, a referendum will only be organized  if the outcome of the negotiations is to be approved. The  decisionmakers can interpret the abstentions the way they want  to, that is, in favor of membership in the EU. Counting them  this way, EU membership could be approved, even if there are  fewer yes votes than no votes. That does not seem right.    On the other hand, it would be unfair to assume that there  are more yes votes than no votes and abstentions combined. Then  an abstention would in practice be the same as a no vote. If  abstentions are given the same weight as yes and no votes, the  whole referendum may go all wrong. Let us remember what we  intend to determine: Are Finns saying yes or no to EU membership?</p>

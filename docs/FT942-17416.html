			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / Arts: Onegin on a shoestring - Opera The day of the disposable opera production is drawing nigh. The problem with encouraging audiences to expect a risk-taking production with novel ideas when they go to the opera is that the novelty soon wears off and then they do not want to see it again. The risk is financial as much as artistic, since any revivals are likely to lose money. The Arts Council put its finger on this dilemma when it warned English National Opera that the company had an insufficient stock of revivable productions. The new management has taken that to heart, scheduling no less than eight new productions for next season. More immediately, there is the question of what to do about revivals already planned of first-time failures. The 1989 Eugene Onegin was one of those - not an outrageous disaster, but uninspiring (the worst kind at the box-office). At first a straight revival was announced, then a 're-staging', and finally a new production, though heaven knows how little money was available for Julia Hollander. Her designers (Fotini Dimou the sets and Tahra Kharibian the costumes) have at least managed to make a twopenny budget look as though it stretched to threepence-ha'penny. By the middle of the opera one gets used to the back-to-basics settings. Madame Larina's party is a crowded affair, where dancing couples bump into each other, nicely capturing the parochial atmosphere. Lensky and Onegin's duel is held on a lonely, frosty landing-stage. On balance, this is an improvement on before, as is Hollander's production. After the previous experiment had failed, there must have been pressure to deliver a conventional show. This is by and large what she has done, dressing the opera fairly sensitively in the period and social milieu for which it was intended. There is little novelty this time round, but much that is straightforward and true, especially in the treatment of the main characters. Cathryn Pope looks by far the youngest Tatyana I have seen. A mere adolescent, she is shy and uncertain of herself, a bundle of unformed impulses, blown this way and that by the conflicting emotions of the Letter Scene. One's sympathy goes out to her, just as Tchaikovsky intended. Inevitably the older Princess Gremin suits her less well (the top of the voice is unpleasantly strained) but, in her, the opera has found its heart. The Onegin and Lensky are well differentiated physically: Peter Coleman-Wright's Onegin is tall and handsome, an outwardly assertive man with firm and decisive singing to match; Bonaventura Bottone's Lensky is short and plump, dressed in slightly shabby poet's clothes, his bright tenor encompassing the music with accomplishment, but not much romance. Neither stimulates the emotions, as Pope's Tatyana does. The focus remains firmly on the central trio, though Ethna Robinson has the cheerful bounce for Olga and Richard Van Allan gets dignity to do duty for strong top notes as Prince Gremin. There is no need to look at the programme to tell that a Russian conductor is in the pit. Alexander Polianichko hails from the Bolshoy and gives us Tchaikovsky school of Svetlanov, vibrant, passionate, the volume turned up to maximum for the Polonaise. He has no doubts where the opera is heading and it is his brazen decisiveness which keeps the momentum going in an evening which might have faltered under another conductor. Presumably this budget production is only intended as a stop-gap. What will ENO do for Eugene Onegin next time? In repertory until 4 May</p>

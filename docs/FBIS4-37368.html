			<p>BFN     [Text] Gaza, QUDS PRESS -- A Palestinian media official has  said Palestinian radio and television will begin experimental  transmissions on the first of July. The radio will temporarily  transmit six to eight hours daily and television about four  hours daily.    Engineer Hisham Makki, general coordinator of radio and  television in the Gaza Strip, said Palestinian President Yasir  'Arafat has agreed to a request by Radwan Abu-'Ayyash, official  in charge of the radio and television corporation, to use the  Palestinian police building as a temporary office for the  corporation. He added that one temporary studio for radio  transmissions and another for the production of light television  programs are being built in coordination with the Jericho  municipality.    He said Abu-'Ayyash has received donations from Arab and  foreign countries in the form of equipment and funds. Germany,  he said, offered to build a small studio and to pay the salaries  of 15-30 persons working in it for one year.    In a statement to QUDS PRESS, Makki, who had earlier worked  for television stations in Jordan, Abu Dhabi, and Morocco, said  experimental transmissions will begin on 1 July. He added that  a questionnaire has been distributed among the citizens in the  occupied Arab territories to determine transmission times  suitable for them.    He said work at the radio and television corporation will be  governed by the need to safeguard principles, ethics, religion,  and the Islamic creed. He added: The television will be the  property of all the Palestinian people, as well as their mirror.  It will not belong to any party and will be open for  participation by all qualified and experienced parties. He said  cultural, social, and political programs, as well as family  programs and everything that pertains to the Palestinian affairs  will be presented.    Makki said he intends to prepare a program called "The Vigil  Eye" to be presented by the public relations and moral guidance  department of the Palestinian national security forces. The  program will deal with police news and include reportage on  their work as well as interviews. It will also deal with the  conditions of prisoners.    He emphasized that Palestinian television, in cooperation  with the second channel of the French television, will cover the  special occasion of PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat's arrival in the  self-rule areas, under the name of the Palestinian Radio and  Television Corporation.</p>

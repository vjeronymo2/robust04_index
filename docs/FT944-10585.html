			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / World Trade News: EU's new car distribution 'archaic' The main arguments used by Europe's motor industry to win renewal of new car distribution's exemption from EU competition law have been challenged by the top US automotive expert of McKinsey, the international management consultancy. Mr Glenn Mercer said that recent industry trends made the manufacturers' arguments - broadly accepted by the European Commission last month - 'increasingly outdated'. He described the practices the exemption was designed to preserve as 'fairly archaic'. Contrary to the industry's claims, its traditional distribution system was obsolete, inefficient and failed to meet consumers' needs. Without fundamental reforms, the system would become increasingly uneconomic and out of touch with the market. Mr Mercer's analysis, set out in an article in the latest McKinsey Quarterly, is based mainly on US experience. However, he said yesterday that most of its conclusions also applied to Europe, particularly the continent. European manufacturers claim cars are technically sophisticated products and that they must retain the right to supply them only through franchised dealers. They say the system encourages competition and benefits consumers by assuring high standards of sales and service. However, Mr Mercer disputes these arguments. He says: Many franchised dealers are too small to survive in a free market, while their role in supplying information to manufacturers and customers has declined as car-buyers have become better informed. Car-buyers are increasingly dissatisfied with franchised dealers. According to US market research, most consumers find visiting a dealer even more unpleasant than a dental appointment. The claim that cars need special after-sales care has been undercut by their increasing reliability. Franchised dealers are not well-equipped for servicing. Servicing would often be performed more efficiently by large specialised garages which were not tied to branded manufacturers. Independent franchised dealers are no longer the most efficient way of selling cars. Large savings could be made if manufacturers sold cars direct to customers, through discount warehouse clubs or through wholly owned dealerships. Contrary to European manufacturers' claims, many customers would like to buy from large outlets stocking competing brands at one site. Multi-brand outlets have already captured about 10 per cent of the US market, Mr Mercer says. Don't just optimise - unbundle; The McKinsey Quarterly 1994 No 3.</p>

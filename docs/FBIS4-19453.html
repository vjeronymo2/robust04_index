			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Chancellor Helmut Kohl by Dieter Schroeder </F> and Martin E. Sueskind; place and date not given: "I Am  Rendering Massive Election Assistance in Bavaria"]    [Text] [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] You fasted and meditated over  Easter, Mr. Chancellor. How many pounds did you lose, and how  fit do you feel for the contest in the coming months?    [Kohl] I lost the same amount of weight as I do every year:  17 pounds. I believe in fasting, because fasting does not  primarily mean losing weight. It mainly means developing a  clear head. I did this out of religious convictions. I feel in  to condition. I am ready to fight. I was already sure earlier  on that I would win the Bundestag election, and now I am even  more sure.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Also because Mr. Kinkel has issued a  coalition statement to your advantage? Is that the FDP's  [Freedom Democratic Party] final answer to a social-liberal  coalition?    [Kohl] I have no doubts at all that the CDU/CSU [Christian  Democratic Union/Christian Social Union] and FDP coalition will  gain a majority in the October Bundestag election. I consider  the idea that the great people's parties are crumbling  ridiculous. They are not crumbling in the wings, nor will the  voters stay at home en masse. We will once again have an  excellent election turnout, i.e. about 80 percent. I am not  worried about the FDP. There is an occasional tendency to sound  death-knells for the FDP. But clever people inside the FDP know  that this is only to their advantage, because Germany needs a  party like that.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] In the presidential elections,  differences of opinion inside the FDP could cause a loss of  Liberal votes for the Union candidate Roman Herzog. Do you see  such a danger?    [Kohl] No, I do not.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] When you take a look at the other  partner, the CSU, which is having trouble carrying on its own  past that is stamped with the personality of Franz-Josef  Strauss, is there no danger to your election victory?    [Kohl] It is true that the CSU is having difficulty with  this  matter right now. That the problem has arisen just now is no  coincidence, but deliberate, and has something to do with the  Landtag and Bundestag elections. I see a good chance of the CSU  winning both the Landtag and Bundestag elections. As far as  Franz-Josef Strauss is concerned, I am better qualified to speak  out than most of the others. There is hardly anyone who has had  more arguments with him than me. There is no denying, however,  that Franz-Josef Strauss was one of the greatest and most  impressive figures in German postwar politics, and that he,  together with other figures such as Alfons Goppel, made a  decisive contribution to the reconstruction of modern Bavaria as  one of the leading laender. I know better than many others that  Strauss had many facets. I find it terrible that many people  are dissociating themselves from Strauss now that he is dead.  When he was alive, they just could not get close enough to him.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] How many voters must the CSU have in  Bavaria for you to succeed in Bonn?    [Kohl] I have never attached much importance to arithmetical  sums. I tell you, we the coalition will attain a sufficient  majority in the Bundestag election. I have no doubt at all  about that. In any case, you must not forget that the joint  CDU-CSU chancellor is a good candidate for the Bavarians. As a  man of the Palatinate, I myself am a born Bavarian. My father  was a Frank. I am going to render massive election assistance  in Bavaria. I am quite sure that we have good changes again  there. And when the Bavarians are faced with the choice of  either Rudolf Scharping or Helmut Kohl, I do not think they will  need a long time to decide who is closer to them.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] But you and your party do not appear  to be winners in the opinion polls.    [Kohl] I do not think much of the opinion polls these days.  It is tomorrow's results that count, primarily the election  results themselves, of course. People are only just beginning  to make comparisons. Mr. Scharping has only been prime minister  in Mainz since 1991. He has never faced the need to make  difficult and frequently unpopular decisions. In 1991, the  earlier weaknesses of the CDU in Rhineland-Palatinate made it  easy for him to win the Landtag election. He has realized the  need to throw his internal party rivals out of the race. That  is his greatest achievement so far.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] That alone is something.    [Kohl] Agreed. I appreciate people who know how to use  power. But it is quite a different thing to retain power at the  top, and I should know, because I have been doing it for over  two decades. I take things as they come. I am trying to do my  duty. Herr Scharping is doing his And then the voters will  decide.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] If you run in Bavaria, you will also  have dealings with the Republikaner. What if the CSU fails to  achieve an absolute majority?    [Kohl] Who told you the Republikaner will win? They need 5  percent of the votes in the Bundestag election. And it is not  so easy to get 5 percent out of 80 million Germans and a 80  percent election turnout.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] But what if they do succeed?    [Kohl] Why should I talk about that? I tell you they will  not win. The huge majority of Germans know very well that every  vote cast for the Republikaner is a vote against internal  stability and our country's foreign image. Apart from that,  most voters know that we cannot afford a red-green experiment.  That would endanger our country's future potential.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Protest voters might not worry about  that.    [Kohl] People find it easier to cast protest votes at a  Landtag election because it carried less risk than a Bundestag  election. But I consider it wrong to underestimate Landtag  elections. The September Landtag election is very important for  Bavaria. At the Bundestag elections, the voter knows that the  future of the entire country is at stake. We will fight the  Republikaner without compunction, but we will not rebuke those  who voted for them, because only a few of these voters were  right-wing radicals. We want to win back as many protest voters  as possible. I see a good chance of chance of that.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Mr. Chancellor, the current debate  has reached the following question: Should one fight the  Republikaner with special laws, such as a law against the  "Auschwitz lie," or perhaps by banning the party altogether?    [Kohl] Those are two different things. I consider a party  ban out of the question, and I wish to make it clear that I  would not do such a thing. A political party must be fought  with political-intellectual resources. As far as legislation is  concerned, for example the "Auschwitz lie," then I am not quite  sure. The "Auschwitz lie" is already punishable, but only legal  loopholes are being discussed. But that is completely different  from banning a party, let me make that quite clear.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Let us get back to Bavaria. If you  put up a strong presence there, how will you handle the  difference of opinion with Prime Minister Stoiber on the subject  of European policy? Can this differences simply be ironed out?    [Kohl] I have nothing to iron out. The CDU and its chairman  have been in favor of a continuity of European policy ever since  Konrad Adenauer. But I have also learned something more. We  adopted the term "United States of Europe" from Winston  Churchill. But that never meant a European duplication of the  United States of America. I discovered that in the minds of the  citizens, association with Europe was something completely  different; not just in Germany, but all over Europe. Therefore  I no longer use the term "United States of Europe." Each one  of us is rooted to his own home territory -- you in Bavaria, and  I in the Palatinate. We remain Germans, Frenchmen, or Italians.  And at the same time we are Europeans. I have no problems  about that when, for example, Edmund Stoiber or the CSU  emphasize the topic of subsidiarity. I am open to that.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] But Finance Minister Waigel gets  quite upset about the subject of Europe. He is worried about  our growing contributions to the EC budget. Can this be an  election topic for the 12 June European elections or later? You  are accused of having been too generous in Maastricht.    [Kohl] Never.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Can this turn into an issue?    [Kohl] Of course it can. We need European unity, the EU,  mainly for two reasons. For me, the decisive question is how we  can guarantee peace and freedom in Europe, and therefore in  Germany also in the future. I am convinced this is only  possible as a member of the EU. We all see the horror pictures  from ex-Yugoslavia, where hatred, murder, and homelesssness are  on the daily agenda. The evil ghosts of the past are at home  not only in the Balkans. They can also emerge in other parts of  Europe. We must take early action against this. Only European  unity can guarantee peace for good. In second place, I would  put the economy. We Germans have the greatest economic  advantage to gain from European unity. When the EEC was founded  in 1957, German exports worth 14 billion marks went to the 12  countries that make up the EU today. In 1992 we exported a good  360 million marks worth of goods to these countries. Therefore  our exports to the EU countries have risen as sharply as our  exports to the rest of the world. We owe many million jobs to  the close economic ties with our European partners. One quarter  of the jobs in Germany are dependent on these ties. As you see,  Europe is no luxury for Germany, but a vital necessity.  Therefore it is short- sighted to complain that we make the  heaviest contributions to the EU budget.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] What does Waigel say when you tell  him that?    [Kohl] Theo Waigel agrees. However, it is true that we have  now reached our financial limits. That also applies to our aid  to Central and East European countries. Germany is not a hen  that keeps laying golden eggs. We must see to it that other  countries also make their contribution, and we must bear in mind  that the present distribution of burdens within the EU -- I am  not talking about the poorer countries like Ireland or Portugal  -- is not in order. There are some things that have to be  checked, and we will also do so. But that does not alter the  fact that we are paying the most and that we have the most  advantages.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Let us remain on the subject of the  economy. You have often referred to the "boom" trends here, but  are these trends not too weak, and are they not appearing too  late to be of advantage to you on election day?    [Kohl] I am not a prophet. All I know is that it is the  economic institutes that are again using the term "boom" these  days, not me. I can see that exports are clearly increasing in  some areas. I think the signs show an improvement and that the  economic path has been set correctly. Wise tariff agreements  have been concluded, and we are achieving a good overall  climate. It is obvious that we are emerging from the depths of  the recession and that the German economy is once again moving  ahead.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] You see optimistic signs, but your  coalition partner has already announced changes to your concept.  The FDP is suggesting a limitation to the solidarity-supplement  on income tax.    [Kohl] I do not consider such thoughts. I have told the  voters clearly -- we need the money for a few more years in  order to encourage the economic and social growth in the new  laender. By the way, the capital we are investing there will be  repaid with interest, for we are investing in the future of the  whole of Germany. Flourishing landscapes -- I have been  insulted and ridiculed for a long time because of this term --  are arising. We will abolish the tax supplement as soon as a  good control over ther budget permits us to do so. But I will  not say when that will happen. There is something else that I  will not say even after the elections. I am not going to repeat  a mistake I once made.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] The mistake was to allow the FDP to  commit you to a one-year limitation of the income tax supplement  that was introduced at that time?    [Kohl] Yes. Needless to say, the faster we get this  business going, the better. I am not keen on tax increases. I  am a keen supporter of a social market economy, which cannot be  made to suffer as far as services are concerned, but must be  profitable for society's sake. Between 1982 and 1989, we  reduced state involvement in the economy from over 50 percent to  under 46 percent. For reasons that are generally known, we now  have to increase this involvement to 52 percent. But I want to  reduce it to its 1989 level as soon as possible.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] When you talk of a comprehensible tax  policy, then you must explain what you meant when you said in  your television interview that additional funds are required in  order to tidy up traffic policy. What does that mean? Will  there be an increase in the tax on crude oil?    [Kohl] We need cars and railroads. The congestion on our  roads is increasing in line with prosperity, and there is no  solution to the problem right now. We need a sensible  combination of rail and road. An overall concept is required  for this purpose, and we are working on such a concept right  now. We must make the railroad competitive. But I am very much  against outlawing road traffic by means of red-green ideology.  There is too much shouting going on. Demonstrations against  road traffic are held, yet people travel to these demonstrations  in their own cars! For many people, cars are a part of their  well-earned freedom. We need a concept that combines road,  rail, and water in a sensible manner. Naturally, we will have to  meet the costs of such a concept. We need more funds for  traffic policy. We will make the appropriate suggestions in our  election program, whereby both the economic and the ecological  aspects of the matter have to be considered.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] The SPD is taking the CDU's place in  many spheres -- in internal security, for example -- and it is  acting as if it were a better version of the CDU and as if  nothing is possible without it. How do you intend to break this  stranglehold?    [Kohl]. Easy. I will tell the people that nothing is right  in the front and in the rear. What makes the SPD a better  version of the CDU? I see nothing. The Social Democrats will  try to appear like the CDU, but one can see the difference.  Remember how long it took the SPD to finally agree on the new  asylum law. Our country would have been spared many problems if  the SPD had not delayed the issue for such a long time.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] If you are planning a massive  election campaign in Bavaria, you must be able to afford a  massive campaign in the new laender as well.    [Kohl] Yes, of course. In the new laender I will take up  all the major positions that I occupied in 1990.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] But the CDU does not have a good  reputation in eastern Germany right now.    [Kohl] We will see during the elections. When I look at the  latest opinion polls in the new laender, I can see that people's  conviction about the economic and social success of German unity  is becoming clearer from one day to the next; 67 percent of  respondents there have said the economic upturn is reaching the  east, and 59 percent claim that their personal situation has  improved as a result of German unity. Only 21 percent say that  they are in a worse situation than they were before unity. At  the end of 1990, 34 percent said they could afford to buy more  than they could under the GDR. In 1991, 39 percent said so, and  today 47 percent are saying so.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] But people do not seem to be thanking  you for it.    [Kohl] When I look at these figures and consider my own  personal experience, then all I can say is that one must talk to  people. Of course the wind is blowing back in our faces right  now, and of course some people are shamelessly stirring up  emotions, for example Mrs. Hildebrandt, the social minister of  Brandenburg. In the eastern part of the country, I will speak  to the people on the same streets and in the same squares that I  spoke to them in 1990, and other places besides. I will tell  them: I promised you that together we would create flourishing  landscapes in the reunited Germany. If I said this would happen  four or five years into the future, I was mistaken. In 1990 I  assumed that our trading partner the Soviet Union would continue  to exist. No one imagined that just one year later the Soviet  Union would collapse and that eastern trade would practically  disintegrate. As recently as summer 1991 I spoke to Mikhail  Gorbachev about supplies from the new laender worth 25 billion  marks. Today we are happy if we deliver just 5 million marks  worth of supplies with the help of Hermes [export credit]  guarantees. As a result of all this, many jobs were lost in the  new laender. The reconstruction will now take longer than  expected, but it is already in full steam, and the emergence of  "flourishing landscapes" can be seen in many places. I might  have got the time scale wrong, but unlike my critics I have made  my contribution to German unity, while others gave up and  betrayed this objective a long time ago.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali  visited you the day before yesterday. If the peace plan for  Bosnia-Herzegovina takes shape, will Germany take part in a UN  peace mission to implement it?    [Kohl] Let me tell you first of all that in a few weeks  time, the Constitutional Court will decide whether such  involvement is in keeping with the Basic Law. We await this  decision. That is the first important thing. The second is --  of course we will help millions of suffering people in a ravaged  land, and not stand aside. But that does not indicate the type  and extent of our help. What are our German worries compared to  the worries of the people who live there? One would have to  have a heart of stone to say that their fate does not concern  us. Therefore, we will offer assistance where needed, also  because one cannot permit the Serbs and Croats to subdue the  Muslims, who are the weaker group. We cannot just stand by and  watch this happen. As for a military involvement, I am  extremely skeptical. Memories of World War II are particularly  vivid in that part of Europe. Therefore, one must ask to what  extent German help is at all desirable, and what form it should  assume.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] It could be a combination of the help  already given in Cambodia and Somalia, in other words medical  and technical aid.    [Kohl] But we are not in Cambodia or Somalia. We will have  to quietly discuss the question of help.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Let us get back to the subject of  Bosnia once again. Tension has arisen with Moscow on account of  the NATO operations. Do you intend to mediate in this matter?    [Kohl] No. I do not like the term "mediation" in this  context.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] But you could telephone your friend  Boris Yeltsin.    [Kohl] That is something else altogether. It is not  mediation. Let me tell you something. Ever since unity,  enormous expectations are being made of us Germans, and we are  quite incapable of fulfilling some of them. Many people say  that the Germans should help whenever something happens in the  world. Today we have excellent relations with Washington,  Moscow, Paris, and London, and we want to use them. But we must  guard against assuming the role of mediator.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] You have had a dispute with your  justice minister about the deportation of the Kurds. Has it  been settled?    [Kohl] There was no dispute. My position on the deportation  of the Kurds is well known. It conforms to the position of all  members of the government. We are a law-governed country that  respects human rights. We do not deport anyone who is  threatened with a death sentence or torture. Because we are a  law-governed country and because our country has to protect its  internal peace, it is quite unacceptable for people who are  guests in our country to intimidate or terrorize others, for  whatever reason. I cannot accept an abuse of the right to  demonstrate for the purposes of violence or street terror. He  who adheres to our laws, as well as the rules governing aliens,  is in no danger of being deported. We behave just like all  civilized countries on earth.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] The law applies to everyone equally.    [Kohl] No one in his right mind denies that. No one who has  not violated the laws in this country is deported. By the way,  the side-effects of such violent misdeeds have to be considered.  We want to remain a county friendly to foreigners, a country  open to the world. That is essential for our future. If we  permit such occurrences, no wonder people complain.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] The last question, Mr. Chancellor.  What do you tell voters who ask why Helmut Kohl should run in  elections for the fourth time after 12 years in office?    [Kohl] There are two major reasons. In the time that I have  at my disposal, I want to achieve as much progress as possible  concerning Germany's internal unity and, concerning European  unity, to do everything I can to prevent a regression, so that  we may never experience developments we thought belonged to the  past, for example the European civil wars that are again taking  place in front of our door in the Balkans. Guaranteeing peace  and freedom for us and future generations is the most important  thing for me. For 49 years we have had the fortune to live in  peace. But that does not mean that peace and freedom are  granted once and for all. Peace and freedom are no simple gift  from heaven. We have to do something for them. We need a  united Germany in a united Europe. I want to continue to work  on that.</p>

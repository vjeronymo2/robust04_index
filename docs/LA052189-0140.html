			<p><P> May 21, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE TIMES SHOPPER: ANTWERP'S DESIGNERS MAKE IT A FASHIONABLE PLACE  </P> <P> When clothing fashioned by young Belgian designers attracted international  attention at this spring's Paris shows, the success surprised some.  </P> <P> To others -- especially couture watchers following the ascending reputation of  the clothing design program at Antwerp's Koninklijke Academie Voor Schonen  Kunsten (the Royal Academy of Fine Arts), Mutsaertstraat 31, 2000 Antwerp,  Belgium -- the applause was earned.  </P> <P> A tradition of excellence at this respected fine arts school goes back about  325 years. The academy's student roster includes famous artists, Vincent Van  Gogh being the best known.  </P> <P> These days, however, it is the academy's avant-garde fashion institute that is  inspiring acclaim.  </P> <P> The institute is producing some of Europe's hottest young designers, and  they've turned the charming port city of Antwerp, about 30 miles north of  Brussels, into a thriving center of haute couture.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Six Top Designers  </P> <P> The top six Belgian designers riding the crest of the wave were graduated from  the academy in 1982. They are Anne Demeulemeester, Walter Van Beirendonck,  Marina Yee, Dirk Van Saene, Dirk Bikkembergs and Dries Van Noten.  </P> <P> They, along with others who were graduated in subsequent years, have  established headquarters and/or boutiques in Antwerp, although they also sell  in boutiques in Brussels and other cities.  </P> <P> Most famous and sought-after is Anne Demeulemeester. She shows at Louis  (Lombardenstraat 2), an Antwerp boutique dedicated to Belgium's haute  designers. Demeulemeester works in wools, in rayon and acetate fabrics.  </P> <P> Black is her favorite color, but she also uses earth tones and splashes of  bright highlights.  </P> <P> Her collection includes finely tailored culottes (about $300 U.S.) to be worn  with form-fitting backless jackets (about $450). Attractive culotte dresses  (about $450) are made of eyelet knits in unusual patterns. Short black or  maroon sweaters (about $250) are designed to reveal midriffs and fit like a  glove.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Boxlike Shapes  </P> <P> Demeulemeester also designs fabulous accessories, including leather handbags,  from roomy, well-tailored envelopes to large, unusual and asymmetrical boxlike  shapes (about $300 and up). Broad and narrow belts come plain (about $70 and  up) or with convenient hard-sided pouches (about $200). Demeulemeester's hats,  straw helmets to bonnets, are perfect for topping off her chic and sassy  ensembles.  </P> <P> Louis also is the Antwerp outlet for Dirk Bikkembergs' trendy, sometimes exotic  men's fashions. His cool, woolen double-breasted jacket (about $800) is  emblazoned with a dragon applique. Another jacket has tuxedo elements imposed  on its otherwise straight lines (about $760), and an unusual red tuxedo jacket  with fringe (about $780) can be worn with white linen trousers with a red  elastic waistband (about $260) for dress-up or with jeans for attitude.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Asymetrical Styling  </P> <P> Two-tone shirts in blue and maroon (about $230) have oddly asymmetrical  styling, and a light blue raincoat (about $550) is a handsome cover-up for rain  or shine.  </P> <P> Dirk Van Saene's elegant women's wear, also in stock at Louis, includes  distinctively silhouetted bell-bottom slacks (about $200) to be worn with white  or purple cotton blouses with gauze sleeves (about $200), or form-fitting  jerseys in bright solid colors or stripes (about $100).  </P> <P> Walter Van Beirendonck, known simply as Walter and considered the most  avant-garde among Belgian designers, makes eccentric sweaters, shorts and pedal  pushers.  </P> <P> His collection is available at Closing Date (Korte Gasthuisstraat 15), a  boutique specializing in knitwear and jeans by top, trendy international  designers (including Katherine Hamnett and Vivienne Westwood, among others).  </P> <P> </P> <P> Pedal Pushers  </P> <P> Especially popular are Walter's vibrantly-colored and sculptural fish-scale,  snake or brick-patterned bulkies and King-Kong theme sweaters (about $180 and  up). Matching pedal pushers (about $140) have bright red knee patches. There  are also wild-looking striped shorts and T-shirts covered with hand patterns.  </P> <P> Dries Van Noten has his own boutique at Nieuwe Gaanderij 63, with men's and  women's styles shown on opposite sides of the shop. Men's ensembles feature  jackets with striped sleeves (about $560), contrasting vests (about $30) and  striped cotton trousers (about $200).  </P> <P> Men's wash-and-wear silk sport shorts (about $250) can be worn with  wash-and-wear silk shirts (about $300) that are fastened with silk frog clasps,  and/or cardigan-like sweat shirts that are fastened in front with shoelace ties  (about $135).  </P> <P> For women there are bolero jackets (about $440), high-waisted culottes (about  $250), comfortable and easy-to-wear washable silk pleated-front trousers (about  $300) and matching long-sleeved shirts (about $250) with brass buttons. Navy  and white are favored colors.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Unusual Touches  </P> <P> Marina Yee's collection is sold at Bellissimo! (Ommeganckstraat 2A). Yee uses  subtle pinks, subdued grays and other quiet, ultra-feminine colors to create  flattering skirt and blouse ensembles (about $350 and up) in silks and flowing  synthetic fabrics. Many of the styles have unusual touches, such as buttons  placed to fasten jackets in a somewhat jaunty, uneven manner (about $400), and  skirts with slightly asymmetrical hems.  </P> <P> Coccodrillo (Huidevettersstraat Nieuwe Gaanderij 48) sells stunning women's  shoes by Demeulemeester, including white dressy oxfords with pointed toes and  square heels (about $200 and up), and men's shoes by Dirk Bikkembergs,  including woven black suede dress slippers (about $155 and up).  </P> <P> The academy program that trained these innovative Antwerp couturiers, and more  recent graduates who are sure to impact the fashion world, takes four years to  complete.  </P> <P> The students' collections are presented at the academy's annual springtime  fashion shows, where the designs are unusual. For example, men's tuxedo jackets  may have bustle backs and detachable sleeves that cling to the upper arm with  elastic. Women's rain slickers may have extra bits of belting that tie around  the body to make the coat look like a straight jacket.  </P> <P> Somehow, all this experimenting and exaggerated style eventually transforms  itself into innovative yet commercially viable, finelytailored, wearable  clothing, all of which is helping to bring fashion fame to Antwerp.  </P> <P> Prices quoted in this article reflect currency exchange rates at the time of  writing.  </P></p>

			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / Hello John, got a new motor? Mr John Major (left), of the 'more muscular response', not only to Bosnia but to his backbenchers, yesterday looked for a soulmate at Triumph Motorcycles, home of what the company calls 'the muscled streetfighter', the Speed Triple, Paul Cheeseright writes. At the factory in Hinckley, Leicestershire, gazing at a row of machines, he brushed aside the suggestion he might buy one: 'That would be an interesting sight, wouldn't it?' His was a visit of symbols. He watched a Daytona model, in metallic Barracuda blue, run through its paces. The Daytona claims to be what he, politically, might like to be, 'a battleship built to outperform, outmanoeuvre and outlast'. Triumph has emerged over the past eight years from the ashes of the domestic motorcycle industry and now exports to Japan. 'Triumph has emerged as a result of a dramatic level of capital investment,' declared Mr Major. Industry now has 'a tremendous opportunity' with inflation down, productivity and employment up.</p>

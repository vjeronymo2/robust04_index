			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / World Trade News: US reviews Canada lumber ruling A US-CANADA trade panel has ordered the US Commerce Department to re-examine its decision of a year ago that Canada was unfairly subsidising softwood lumber exports. It has 90 days to report back to the panel. Washington imposed a 6.5 per cent duty on US imports of lumber from four provinces, among them British Columbia, after the Commerce Department ruled that Canadian timber practices included unfair subsidies, mainly in the form of low tree-cutting fees in provincially owned forests. The panel's decision has been eagerly awaited by the Canadian lumber industry, US homebuilders and environmentalists. The lumber producers and their US customers claim that the higher duties have cost them about Dollars 200m and pushed up US house prices. Canada exported 13bn board feet of softwood lumber valued at Dollars 4.2bn to the US last year, equal to about 29 per cent of the US market. The environmental movement on the other hand, has strongly criticised low stumpage rates as an encouragement to cut down trees. It is pressing for a tighter system of natural resource accounting as part of the North American Free Trade Agreement under negotiation. An official of the Washington-based Natural Resources Defence Council expressed satisfaction that 'as long as the duty remains in place, there remains some leverage to change some of the forestry practices in Canada'. The panel, consisting of five members from both countries, said the Commerce Department should have considered whether the stumpage fees had a distorting effect on normal competitive markets before concluding that they constituted a countervailable subsidy. However, it agreed with some aspects of the department's finding. The bi-national panels, which are set up under the 1989 free trade agreement, have helped the Canadian government defuse political criticism of perceived trade harassment by Washington. Another national panel is examining whether the US International Trade Commission's methods were flawed in finding the duties harmed US industry. See Survey: Canadian Forestry Products</p>

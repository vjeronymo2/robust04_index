			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Lira falls further after police raid Berlusconi business Police early yesterday raided the Milan offices of Fininvest, the business empire of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, damping hopes that his rightwing coalition's confrontation with the judiciary might be contained. The raid, in which computerised information was seized, contributed to a fresh fall in the lira, which traded at L1020 to the D-Mark, and a slide of nearly 3 per cent on the Milan bourse. The financial markets were also nervous about a senate vote that blocked measures to raise 1995 budget revenues through an amnesty on illegal buildings. The move by the police, acting on magistrates' orders, followed the decision by the government coalition on Thursday to send a formal complaint to President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro about the behaviour of Mr Francesco Saverio Borrelli, the Milan public prosecutor. Mr Borrelli had said in a newspaper interview that judicial inquiries into corruption at Fininvest were coming close to implicating Mr Berlusconi. The cabinet asked President Scalfaro to decide whether disciplinary proceedings should be brought against the prosecutor or a criminal prosecution for attacking constitutional authority. The timing of the police seizure suggests it was linked to the complaint filed against Mr Borrelli. This appeared to be confirmed by the Milan magistrates, who indicated police were seeking floppy discs connected to the activities of Telepiu, the cable television channel in which Mr Berlusconi has a 10 per cent stake. The magistrates are investigating whether Mr Berlusconi retained secret control of Telepiu through friendly shareholders after he divested 90 per cent of his stake in 60 days under anti-trust laws in 1990. Mr Berlusconi this week denied there had been any impropriety. President Scalfaro can do nothing with the complaint against Mr Borrelli, but if he fails to support Mr Berlusconi, he risks undermining the prime minister's weak position.

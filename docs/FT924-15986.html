			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / US report on BCCI expected to attack Bank THE CONDUCT of the Bank of England is expected to be severely criticised today in an 800-page report on the Bank of Credit and Commerce International scandal to be released in the US Senate. The Senate sub-committee report, which follows a four-year investigation led by Senator John Kerry, a Massachusetts Democrat, will pre-empt some of the findings of the still unpublished UK report on BCCI by Lord Bingham. Yesterday, Mr Kerry said: 'We've known for a while that the BCCI scandal would turn out to be the biggest example of financial crime in recent memory, but it also demonstrates a grotesque network of greed and influence.' Others expected to be criticised in the report include the government of Abu Dhabi, the majority shareholders of the collapsed BCCI, and Price Waterhouse, the bank's auditor. Abu Dhabi has been repeatedly criticised by Mr Kerry and US prosecutors for withholding documents and witnesses from US authorities. Last week Abu Dhabi's Washington lobbyists claimed Abu Dhabi was now co- operating with the US. Abu Dhabi's Washington representatives said US officials would be able to study 19,000 pages of BCCI-related documents at the Washington embassy of the United Arab Emirates but not take possession of them. Separately, it has been learnt that US officials are investigating the role of Abu Dhabi in the BCCI affair. Abu Dhabi has always described itself as a victim of the fraud, saying it lost billions of dollars as a result of the scandal. UK Foreign Office officials are understood to have been trying to monitor the timing of the Kerry report's release in recent weeks; the report has been de-layed by one week past its originally scheduled publication date.

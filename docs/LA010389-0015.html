			<p><P> January 3, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: STAGE  </P> <P> Ray Cooney's "Run for Your Wife," the longest-running comedy on the London  stage, is Broadway-bound after six years on the West End. The play starts  previews at New York's Virginia Theater on Feb. 22, opening March 7, after a  tryout stint Jan. 17 to Feb. 19 at the Coconut Grove Playhouse in Miami. "It's  so readily acceptable; that's what people relate to," Cooney, 56, said of his  farce about a bigamous taxi driver. "It can be summed up so simply. People can  understand the dilemma of an innocent guy who, because he didn't have the heart  to say no, has got two wives." "Run for Your Wife" has been slated for Broadway  for years, but Cooney said only now had talent and script meshed properly.  Under a special agreement with the American actors' union, Equity, three  British actors will appear in the play for four months on Broadway, at which  point the five Americans completing the New York lineup will transfer to the  London production at the Criterion Theatre.

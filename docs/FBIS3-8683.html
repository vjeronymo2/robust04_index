"Such  important visits must be consulted upon so that I am not taken  by surprise," he added.    The president said the prime minister is "independent and  self-governing, but it would be easier if we agreed on such  matters. I discuss all of my foreign trips with the Mnistry of  Foreign Affairs, and we need more cooperation here so that we  can achieve more," the president said.    At the same time, Lech Walesa said that, according to  information he has, Prime Minster Pawlak's visit "is among the  issues that have been discussed. If new issues are raised and  if the president is not consulted, the situation could be bad,"  he said.</p>

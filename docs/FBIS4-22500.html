			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by P. Shcherbakov: "The Sowing Is Approaching and </F> the Reorganizers Again Have an Itch"]    [Text] Why do politicians and reformers of different  stripes prefer to perplex the peasants and disrupt their  fortunes exactly in the spring and, without fail, before the  sowing? You will recall that both collectivization and the  reforming of the kolkhozes and sovkhozes in 1992 were quite  suited to those times. Seemingly, counting on the fact that the  land would remain a strong umbilical cord, the peasant would go  to the field just the same, summoned by a primordial instinct  during the passionate springtime no matter what happened.  Politics and the reformers' capers are not for him at this time.  The analytical center of the Russian Federation president's  administration recently prepared a memorandum on the final  elimination of kolkhozes, sovkhozes and even newly established  joint-stock companies before the start of the spring sowing. The  memorandum was sent to all Russia's regions and, one must say,  caused much commotion.    In response to this memorandum and also the campaign of lies  and slander unleashed by the mass information media in regards  to the Russian peasantry, which is being accused of almost all  the economic misfortunes, the Agrarian Party of Russia faction  in the State Duma issued a statement on 15 February. This  document provides a well-grounded rebuff, in particular, to the  leaders of the Russia's Choice union who think that the peasants  are receiving excessive financial infusions from the state. In  their opinion, it is this that is causing the present inflation.    However, let us nevertheless examine just how generously the  state is helping the village. As is known, the Russian  Federation Government's decree, which was adopted 23 February  concerning the economic conditions for the functioning of the  agroindustrial complex during 1994, allocates 5 trillion rubles  during the first half of the year; during January-March, that  is, during the spring sowing -- only 1.3 trillion rubles.  Meanwhile, specialists have calculated that rural commodity  producers should spend 1.2 trillion rubles for fuel, lubricants  and mineral fertilizer alone prior to the sowing. This leaves  only 100 billion for everything else. However, 24 percent of the  tractors, 27 percent of the plows and 28 percent of the sowing  machines have still not been repaired. Moreover, in the words of  V. Shcherbak, the Russian Federation's first deputy minister for  agriculture and food, even if all the equipment manages to be  put into the drive, the present pool of machinery will not cope  with the sowing.    This means new equipment is required. It is standing ready  in  factory yards. You see, however, one must pay for it. No one  gives the peasant anything on credit, you know. They only permit  themselves to take from him and not pay for the products. For  example, the state still owes the rural commodity producers 600  billion rubles for the grain delivered in the fall. Let us point  out that no one is planning to adjust the fall calculation for  inflation. Meanwhile, prices grew threefold-fourfold during this  time. Incidentally, credits are being issued to the village at  213 percent interest according to that same government decree.  Thus, who is subsidizing whom: the state -- the village, or the  village -- the state? We call your attention to the fact that  March is already ending and a considerable portion of the  allocated sums has not gotten to the village.    Last week, a meeting of the Russian Federation Government's  Commission for Operational Matters was held under the  chairmanship of O. Soskovets, first deputy of the government,  during which urgent measures to prepare for and carry out the  spring sowing were discussed. During it, Vice-Premier A.  Zaveryukh said right out that a portion of the monetary and  preferential credits allocated to the village are walking about  Moscow, replenishing the super-incomes of commercial banks and  that the Russian Federation's Ministry of Finance "cannot" catch  anyone.    Incidentally, the presentations of the directors of the  ministries, departments and enterprises and of the bankers cited  quite a few cases of irresponsibility and clear procrastination.  However, none of them mentioned the specific names of guilty  persons or hinted at where they could be found. O. Soskovets,  who presided, repeatedly interrupted the speakers with a demand  to personify the criticism; however, everyone with surprising  stubbornness recouped themselves using nameless "cases."    When closing the meeting, O. Soskovets completely rejected  the prepared draft of the decree and demanded that it be  completely done over again within two days, clearly formulating  an effective plan of action for all ministries and departments  connected with the sowing and that control over the document's  implementation, especially the part on personal responsibility  for allocating the credits as designated and on time, be  toughened.</p>

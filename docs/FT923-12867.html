			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / Political Notebook: Labour's leader-in-waiting FOR THE cabinet minister offering political editors an end-of-term drink, there was not a scintilla of doubt that the Labour party was making a huge mistake. Mr John Smith, he declared, was the only leader of Her Majesty's opposition who would allow the Conservatives to summon up in 1996 memories of the winter of discontent. Even now central office would be digging out grainy footage of Mr Smith consorting with the union leaders who brought the country to its knees in 1978. The images might be juxtaposed neatly with the more recent ones of another generation of union bosses explaining piously that it was a waste of time and money to consult their members before casting their votes for him in the leadership contest. So who should Labour have chosen? The answer came without hesitation: Mr Tony Blair. The opposition should have skipped a generation. More importantly, it should have opted for the politician who had grasped the scale of the changes required to make the opposition electable. The assessment is universal among senior ministers: their opponents are still looking for a leader to gloss over the past rather than one who has policies to confront the future. Like most sweeping judg-ments, it is too simplistic. Persuading the voters that Mr Smith is a militant trades unionist will be as easy as convincing them that Mr Major and Lady Thatcher are still good friends. For a Tory party used to scoring easy points off Mr Neil Kinnock's past, the solid centrism that comes with membership of the Scottish bar will prove an elusive target. Mr Smith's fluent and sharp debating style promises a rough ride for Mr Major across the floor of the Commons. The circumstances also are propitious. He faces a prime minister with a majority of 21 rather than 100 and a party whose celebration of its fourth election victory has vanished into a sea of acrimony over Europe and the economy. But then, scratch beneath the superficial confidence of the Labour MPs who have flocked to annoint the leader-in-waiting and there is unease to match the Conservatives' confidence. Mr Blair's name is whispered as frequently on the opposition as on the government frontbench. The 39-year-old MP for Sedgefield has played no part in the leadership campaign save as one of Mr Smith's many backers in the shadow cabinet. He considered standing for the post of deputy. Few doubt that he could have won it. But he was discouraged, if not warned off, by some in the Smith camp when Mrs Margaret Beckett declared her candidacy. Now he is promised the home or foreign portfolios. The prize of the shadow chancellor's job will go to Mr Gordon Brown, a friend and rival for the future leadership. But Mr Blair's absence from the contest has emphasised the timidity of his party's post-election debate. Others have danced minuettes around the fundamental issues facing the party. Mr Blair has signalled from the sidelines they must be confronted head on. His starting point is not whether a mechanism can be found to end the block vote while ensuring the trades unions still wield an influence commensurate with their financial contribution. Alone on the Labour front-bench, Mr Blair has begun to spell out how 1980s revisionism should be followed by 1990s radicalism. He is impatient; dismissive of those who believe the leadership can devote the next year to cosmetic organisational changes. Labour, he believes, must start with a fresh concept of how an electable centre-left party should look in the approach to the 21st century. The answer clearly is not found in a party structure that attracts fewer members than the National Trust; and which is entirely dependent for its resources on a handful of union leaders. Mr Blair argues passionately that Labour must recognise that its post-war success was built not on an illusory working-class altruism, but on the perception that it offered the majority the best route to individual advancement. Now it needs a project to rescue its concept of the community from that of the centralised state, placing it instead in the context of individual aspirations which the Tories have so skilfully tapped. On such subjects Mr Smith has been virtually silent. But his fortunes and those of his party may well depend on the extent to which the new leader will bend his instinctive conservatism to the radicalism of his most likely successor.</p>

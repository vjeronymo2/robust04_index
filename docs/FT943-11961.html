			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / Survey of The Bank of England (9): Systematic adjustment - Global transformation has increased competition for gilts Given the turmoil in international bond markets this year, most discussion of the role of the Bank of England in the gilt-edged market has centred on its ability to fund the government's deficit smoothly. Look at the longer-term context, though, and a different picture emerges. The Bank's role is about managing change in such a way that the gilts market can hold its own in an era of global transformation. Change came abruptly to the gilts market with the Big Bang revolution of 1986. That put an end to the old jobbing system, and introduced the concept of marketmakers which was familiar to international investors even if it was new to the UK domestic market. But adapting to the new system has not always been easy; and with the increasing internationalisation of financial flows, one could argue that the process of change has become continuous. If the gilts market is to attract funds, it simply has to be competitive with other leading bond markets. The early stages of market reform after Big Bang brought disappointing returns for the new marketmakers. A period of surplus in the government's accounts meant that the market began to shrink. The number of marketmakers seeking to make their fortune there dwindled noticeably  - though it has now begun to pick up again. With the return of Hoare Govett (announced in June) there will be 21 marketmakers, and capital committed to the market now exceeds that at the time of Big Bang. Thus the Bank can now claim that the system has been reasonably successful, although returns for marketmakers remain quite modest. Last year the combined after-tax profits of the marketmakers was just Pounds 59m, and their net return on average capital was 9 per cent. Both these figures were down on 1992 - the year which brought the bonanza of the Tory election victory and the UK's exit from the exchange rate mechanism. Still, there is no doubt that the marketmaking structure has brought the market a high level of liquidity, narrower dealing spreads and a large increase in overseas participation. More than half the marketmakers are of foreign parentage. The structure is more robust: before Big Bang there were only two jobbers (wholesale dealers). The market is also now pretty large. The value of all stock outstanding rose in 1993-94 to Pounds 218.5bn from Pounds 168.1bn the previous year. Daily average turnover in 1993-94 rose to Pounds 6.7bn from Pounds 5.2bn. This represented a little under 4 per cent of the total stock outstanding. Index-linked stock accounts for about 15 per cent of the total. This year the Bank has also added to the range of instruments by issuing two floating rate stocks, as well as reviving the convertible instrument. Since Big Bang the Bank has also had to adapt its operating techniques to provide the government with the funds it needs. Nowadays, this involves a mixture of regular auctions and tap issues designed to take advantage of particular pockets of market demand. The auctions take place at roughly monthly intervals and involve the sale of between Pounds 2bn and Pounds 4bn worth of paper. The Bank has been criticised this year for missing an opportunity to sell very long-dated paper with a maturity of about 25 years at the time when rates were at their lowest. Officials reply that it did manage to sell a 17-year issue at a yield of just 6.4 per cent in January, which still represents a good deal for the taxpayer. More important, perhaps, is that the mixture of auctions and tap issues allows it both to lock in good deals in an opportunistic way, while giving the market some ability to predict supply. Such a pragmatic approach is typical of the Bank's general attitude. Officials say it has tried to allow the market to evolve in the way that people wanted. The marketmakers have thus been allowed to deal in swaps, derivatives and Ecu instruments. This has enabled them to become integrated with their parent groups in providing hedging services to their clients. The evolutionary process continues, though some argue that it should go faster. The big question confronting the Bank now is whether it should allow general freedom to market participants to undertake repurchase arrangements which effectively allow them to borrow and lend stock. Many believe that this would help the gilts market compete at an international level, not least by adding to liquidity. The Bank is currently undertaking consultations with the market on the question of repurchase deals, but its approach remains cautious. Among the questions it is asking is whether a re-purchase system would work and whether it would add to international demand for gilts. Arrangements are already in place for market-makers to borrow stock. That is a privilege they enjoy in return for the obligation to quote two way prices. The Bank is also concerned about the impact of a repurchase system on other parts of the financial markets. It might lessen the attraction of certificates of deposit, bills and other financial instruments. Another reform which the market has been seeking - the right to settle transactions through the Euroclear and Cedel international settlement facilities - seems less controversial. Certain technical issues have still to be ironed out, but there is no obstacle in principle to the change. In contrast to gilts, there has been less focus recently on the Bank's role in managing the money markets. Though some might regard its system of operating through specialised discount houses as antiquated, it seems to work satisfactorily and the Bank is satisfied that it can exercise influence over money market rates. There was a problem, until recently, which was connected with the gilt market where the Bank was selling more paper than strictly necessary in order to comply with the rule that sales to banks and building societies did not count as funding of the government deficit for monetary policy terms. That meant the Bank was constantly having to relieve shortages of liquidity in the money market. The hope is that this problem will disappear now the funding rules have been changed. The daily money market shortages have become less pronounced and very short term rates are more stable.</p>

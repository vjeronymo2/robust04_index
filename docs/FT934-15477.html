			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Industrial gas bills set to rise BRITISH GAS is expected to announce price rises today for new medium-term contracts for interruptible supplies, a category which covers just over 100 large industrial users. The price rises, ranging from 2.1 per cent to 12.5 per cent, depending on the volume of gas purchased, will affect three-to-10-year contracts signed on or after November 2. Existing contracts or companies seeking shorter-term contracts will not be affected. Interruptible users, which typically use gas for power generation at large industrial sites, pay low prices but risk being cut off during periods of peak demand, when many are able temporarily to use oil or other fuels. Competition in the market to supply large gas users has seen British Gas' share of the non-interruptible contract market fall to 40 per cent. Independent gas suppliers have also captured 19 per cent of the upper tariff market, which generally includes smaller commercial and large residential users. No competitors have emerged in the low-margin interruptible market. Prices for interruptible users were last raised in June 1992. Last week the Combined Heat and Power Association, a body which promotes the use of combined heat and power systems, warned that the increased use of energy-efficient power generation schemes could be jeopardised by higher prices for interruptible gas supplies. The association said it feared British Gas would raise prices for interruptible supplies, which had 'kick-started' its industry. The process, which produces both heat and electricity, has been promoted by the government as one of the main ways to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.</p>

			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / Israel links growth to settlement policy ISRAEL'S new government has warned that a freeze on new building in Jewish settlements in the occupied territories will also curb economic growth in the short term and delay a fall in unemployment, currently running at a record 11.5 per cent, writes Hugh Carnegy in Jerusalem. The Labour-led coalition which took power earlier this month is committed to shifting resources from the territories to Israel 'proper' and increasing infrastructural investment in an attempt to generate high growth sufficient to cope with mass immigration from the former Soviet Union. A freeze on 6,000 settlement housing units, and restrictions on construction activity within Israel, are a first step towards implementing this policy. This week, the government has also taken steps to rescind government incentives from industrial plants in Jewish settlements. The actions are expected to help secure Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.2bn) in US loan guarantees Israel wants to finance immigration absorption. But Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the prime minister, and Mr Avraham Shochat, the finance minister, have both warned that a short-term effect will be to limit growth. Mr Shochat told parliament's finance committee that gross national product in 1993 was unlikely to grow significantly. 'The fruits in employment and investment will be seen in 1994-95,' he said. Growth this year is expected to be around 5 per cent, with more than half accounted for by state-backed construction.</p>

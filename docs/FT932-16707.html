			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Clients of factor company investigated THE Inland Revenue is monitoring the circumstances of the collapse of two companies which had business dealings with London and Provincial Factors, the debt trading company that failed five weeks ago. In an unusual move a tax investigator attended creditors' meetings which were held to wind up Brentford Radio Cars, a car hire company, and Europublishing, both operating in London. The investigator, from the Revenue's special office in Edinburgh which examines cases outside the scope of local tax offices, has also joined the creditors' committees monitoring the liquidation of the two companies. The collapse of London and Provincial Factors with net debts of more than Pounds 7m surprised other companies in the industry. Debt trading companies - known as factors - provide services which range from taking over the management of their clients' sales ledgers to lending them a percentage of the value of their invoices. Clients are usually liable for bad debts and it is rare for a factor to go bust. Matters relating to LPF's collapse are also being examined by the Fraud Squad. It is understood that the squad will decide whether to launch a formal investigation later this month. LPF's receivership caused difficulties for up to 40 of its clients. Mr Stephen Mills, managing director of Leo Lithographics, a small printing business, said his company faces collapse within seven days because its invoices are now held by LPF's receivers, two accountants from Grant Thornton. The receivers said: 'All the clients of LPF have been given the opportunity of getting back invoices sold to the factoring company on payment of the amounts advanced to them by LPF.' The receivers said they 'have agreed a number of deals on this basis. In the case of the Leo company it has been unable to raise the necessary funding'. LPF's collapse has prompted the Association of British Factors and Discounters to urge the Bank of England to regulate independent factors, such as LPF, more tightly. The association's members account for more than 90 per cent of the industry's turnover. LPF is not a member. At least five companies, which were all clients of LPF, are known to have gone into liquidation since July 1990, owing more than Pounds 3m to the factoring company, according to liquidators' estimates. The remaining three are Isleworth Press (formerly Recorder Newspapers plc), Embassy Radio Cars, Boston Publications (formerly Recorder Newspapers Ltd) and Heathrow Engine Centre. At the Brentford Radio Cars creditors' meeting, Mr Ian Lowe, an executive of the car hire company, listed several assets which he said he believed should not be included in the company's statement of affairs because they were secured against the personal assets of the executives. These included a yacht and three properties. Europublishing's directors said in their written report to creditors that the company's liquidation had been precipitated by LPF's receivership. They claimed the factoring company owed Europublishing more than Pounds 4m in losses suffered because of the need for a speedy sale to an unconnected newspaper group. A spokesman for the receivers of LPF said: 'Far from LPF causing the failure of Europublishing, LPF actually provided Europublishing with more funds than they were entitled to under the factoring agreement. 'In fact, based on figures prepared by the company and on information provided to the receivers, the receivers believe LPF is looking at a shortfall in excess of Pounds 500,000 on this account.' Europublishing, which traded as Recorder, lists creditors including Mr Mario Nicolaides and Mr Michael Rowan, both former directors of Recorder Newspapers Ltd, which changed its name to Boston Publications before its collapse in April 1991. Mr Rowan was also until last summer a director of Embassy Radio Cars (1981), which changed its name to Brentford Radio Cars last month. Mr Nicolaides was sentenced to 80 hours community service for fraudulent trading in a separate company last month.</p>

			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / Fear for jobs 'likely to offset' tax-cut boost RISING unemployment and falling house prices are likely to offset any positive effect on consumer confidence of a 1p cut in the basic rate of income tax in tomorrow's Budget, according to PA Cambridge Economic Consultants The private-sector economic research company said its latest quarterly survey of consumer trends, which was completed on March 1, shows that conditions for sus-tained consumption growth in Britain have not materia-lised. The consultants said fears of rising unemployment were likely to cause consumers to postpone spending decisions in spite of the widely expected cut in the basic rate of income tax from 25 per cent. According to the survey of 1,000 consumers 37 per cent do not believe the worst of the recession will be over until unemployment peaks, while 57 per cent believe it will take at least a further six months for the recession to bottom out. The consultants' overall consumer confidence index, which takes employment prospects, the financial situation of households and confidence in the government into account, rose slightly to 87.3 in March from 85.1 in December. But it was below the 93.8 and 92.2 levels of last September and March respectively. The consultants' index of consumption activity, which measures current consumption of a range of goods, fell from 100.9 in December to 93.8 this month, its lowest level since the index was first compiled in March last year. While the consultants' latest poll of consumers offers no comfort for the government, Infolink, a credit information group, believes that demand for consumer credit is showing some signs of recovery. Infolink's figures, which are based on the number of credit checks by lenders, suggested that the retail sector experienced a 9.7 per cent increase in credit demand in January compared with January last year. Demand for credit from Infolink's clients among specialist home loans companies, finance houses and in the new car loans sector, was lower than in January last year, but compared with recent months, Infolink detected a 'tentative upward trend' in credit demand. Mr Brian Bailey, Infolink's chairman, said: 'Whilst spending confidence is still low, it appears that the beginnings of a gradual economic recovery could be around the corner.' He said the company would need February's figures before making a more confident prediction. THE chancellor may be disappointed if he is counting on tax cuts in this week's Budget to fuel a strong recovery in high-street spending, according to a survey. Asked what they would do if they received a cash windfall such as a tax rebate, 37 per cent of consumers said they would take a holiday, while 14 per cent said they would pay off debts. Only a third said they would use the money to buy clothes or home furnishings. The survey, conducted by Gallup for IPC Magazines in the middle of last month, found that half of consumers saw no end to the recession, while a third said it would last at least another year.</p>

			<p><P> July 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE SEARCH FOR PERFECTION  </P> <P> I disagree with Jonathan Gold's findings in "The Search for the Perfect Fried  Chicken," July 2. The best fried chicken I have ever had in town is at Aunt  Kizzy's Back Porch in the Marina. It is fried in peanut oil and it is  absolutely delicious.  </P> <P> WILLIAM ADAMS  </P> <P> Venice  </P></p>

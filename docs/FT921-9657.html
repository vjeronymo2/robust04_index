			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Investment fund launch by Ahold AHOLD, the Netherlands' biggest food retailer, yesterday launched a campaign to sell a new, in-house investment fund to its customers, writes Ronald van de Krol in Amsterdam. From next week shoppers at Ahold's Albert Heijn chain of supermarkets will be able to buy savings stamps and use them towards investing in a mutual fund which will evenly divide its assets between existing Ahold shares and the company's interest-bearing money market instruments. Ahold estimates that the fund will attract Fl 500m (Dollars 280m) to Fl 1bn over the next five to seven years. The Ahold Dutch Customer Fund will be managed by merchant bank Pierson, Heldring &amp; Pierson.</p>

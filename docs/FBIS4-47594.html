Leading Scientists of Kurchatov Institute Talk  About Coming Changes'']  txt}[Text] OG: Many have attributed the current  decline in prestige of science directly to the Chernobyl  disaster, while scientists, the creators of new sources of  energy, are seen as Greeks bearing gifts of which one must  beware at all costs...    Ponomarev-Stepnoy: Clearly, this is the wrong  approach. The causes of the disaster lay in a sociopolitical  system, rather than in science. It must be kept in mind that for  decades the nuclear industry was a state within a state,  entirely out of contact with the other world: there were cities  not shown on any map, the strictest discipline was maintained in  classified combines. This is what drove all nuclear danger  inward. And this rigid and closed system produces a child and  turns it loose on God's world. And no one even stops to think  about how to fix things so that this child does not make a devil  of a mess. None of the necessary steps were taken to safeguard  the existence of nuclear power outside the confines of the state  within a state.    Chernoplekov: The late Anatoliy Petrovich  Aleksandrovich, a pioneer and staunch supporter of nuclear  power, started getting uneasy rather early on. He repeatedly  reported to the management that the intensive development in  this field had its down side as well, and that immediate steps  were needed. And incidentally, he did manage to get some steps  taken at the time. The Nuclear Power Oversight was his  initiative, as was the introduction of military certification of  all goods for nuclear electric power plants.    OG: Heretofore, the entire structure of Soviet  science had been determined by the part it had to play in the  socialist society. Now we are converting to a market economy,  and yet this structure remains virtually unchanged...    Belyayev: Science is not alone in having that  trouble. We have all been living in a society with distorted  proportions. We had a huge army, huge science--true pearls in  the crown of the Soviet Empire! Consider this unique phenomenon:  the existence of an enormous number of political, economic and  sociological institutes. No one nation has such a thing. And all  these institutes were in fact subsidiary institutions of the  Central Committee of the CPSU. In many areas, we have  proportions that have been broken. Of course, science needs  restructuring, that's obvious.    OG: With regard to the ``brain drain'' to the  West, the problem is perhaps exaggerated at the moment. The more  so in the case of your field...    Belyayev: In our nuclear centers, the situation is  just about hopeless. They are having a tough time getting  reoriented. There is virtually no problem of a ``brain drain''  to the West in the nuclear industry. For us it is something  else: there is no ``replenishment'' of key personnel. Out of 96  graduates of our department at the Physicotechnical Institute,  40 have gone over to the West. Half of the remaining 56 have  gone to commercial banks. And incidentally, you can now find  Physicotechnical Institute graduates in the management of just  about any commercial bank.    Kadomtsev: If you add up the number of papers that  have been written by the most eminent scientists, it turns out  that half the papers are being written by a number equal to the  square root of the total number of scientists, and they are the  source of half the work. Extract the square root of the million  scientists that we now have in our nation, and you get a  thousand people actively creating science. What is the outcome?  You can't tell me that there aren't many people leaving. In  fact, if you take a thousand eminent scientists, and out of  those there are thirty of the front leaders going elsewhere, the  scientific potential is cut in half.    It is not only the number of talented scientists that is  significant. They have an impact, as it were, on the whole  coloring. If schools of science fall away, so does the  scientific potential. It is for this reason that we have to keep  an eye on who is leaving. And unfortunately, the ones leaving  are the most talented. About three years ago, it was barely  noticeable, and now it is obvious. On the other hand, you can  hear Russian being spoken in literally any U.S. university. I  have seen many of our graduates there. Their potential, of  course, has considerably increased because Russian scientists  are nothing at all like their Western colleagues. Our scientists  have a different ``set'' from those of the West. There a  scientist, like any engineer, is narrowly specialized. On the  other hand, here in one continuous tangle a person has to be  much more broadly educated and diverse to have a normal  existence. When our people reach the West, they have a  tremendous advantage over Western specialists simply by virtue  of their education and our specific character.  the indigenous ``families''...    Kadomtsev: There is yet another side to the issue:  the role, place and volume of research that our nation can allow  itself. Prior to perestroyka, the USSR was second in science  only to the United States. Now the empire has crumbled, and the  information loss has been enormous. Without the ability to  communicate, the potential began to decline very rapidly.  Secondly, science lost its prestigious position in the nation,  which is part of a general pattern. There had been a huge empire  which, like any empire, had been watching out for its crown, for  its facade. It is no exaggeration to say that this facade was  magnificent. Excellent education, advanced technology,  leading-edge science on a par with Western standards. But  unfortunately, the rest of the infrastructure of the nation  could not be pulled up to this level. Of course, from time to  time it was remembered that help was sometimes needed in rural  areas. They got us together and sent us out to a collective farm  to bring in the harvest. We were puzzled about the reason for  sending intellectuals to do such work, why workmen were not sent  instead. But the workmen were elsewhere, helping out in the  ``boondocks.'' Now it is clear that science as it exists in  Russia is unfortunately larger in scale than the Russian  potential can support. Even if the present government had the  desire to act and support the facade on the same level (it is  not in fact so concerned), it could not now be done. Once we had  a privileged position. But another component of society had been  decapitated, and the potential sucked out. The management that  should have existed in a normal nation was underdeveloped. It  did not absorb young blood. Today, young people have realized  that by working in this field one can achieve a much better  standard of living and have chances to improve one's position in  society. It is natural that our alumni are now looking at  commercial banks rather than at Kurchatov Institute. In fact,  even earlier we should have been sharing with management, where  there is a need for young people.    At one time our former prime minister Valentin Pavlov said:  ``All of Soviet science is working for the West.'' And although  it is harsh and coarse, the quote is not groundless. Science is  international. All results of research, except for what is  classified, are published in the scientific press and are the  property of the world community. Scientists of different nations  form ``invisible colleges'' that are thoroughly familiar with  one another's work, and react instantaneously to the  corresponding results. But different nations put the product of  science to different uses. ``Balanced nations'' like the United  States very rapidly transform scientific knowledge and  technology into new goods. And thereby they enrich their nation.  But we have failed to tune our internal social organism with  sufficient finesse.    OG: On the other hand, we see that the United  States has not just ``jumped'' at building its own orbital  station. A joint project with Russia has been agreed to. And for  a measly 400 million dollars, we give up everything we have, all  our unique technologies.    Ponomarev-Stepnoy: Of course, we could elect not  to give it up. But then our space technology would die. Here is  the dilemma: to give it up, or not to give it up and perish. The  Americans take us as partners, and we give them a lot. But so  what? We should learn to work like they do. I can cite a  specific example. We have sold the United States nuclear power  plants for spacecraft. We have invested a certain part of the  proceeds in development of new technologies. Among other things,  we have financed the development of new coolants for  refrigerators. Something that the United States and other  nations have been working on to no avail so far. They have  passed a law: no freons down and worked out a formula for a  coolant that will not harm the ozone layer and can be used in  existing refrigerators. However, we have this fluid without  freons that no one has need of. We wanted to take out a patent,  so the Americans told us: ``As soon as you publish everything,  we will make the same fluid, adding, say, one atom of argon.  Then it will be our patent. We will simply take your fluid and  charge our refrigerators with it. You can take us to court and  be in litigation for ten years. Assume that you win the suit. We  pay you 500,000 dollars, you will spend millions to get it, and  we will get billions.'' So learning to get into the market is  not that simple. We must pay our dues with our brains and our  technologies.    Belyayev: A characteristic feature of our science  has been that fundamental research was most open. There was a  maximum of international exchange. A lot of it has already been  incorporated into world science. But the most material intensive  and fund intensive, and perhaps the most important research for  our science was classified as a rule. Here it must have been no  worse for us than for them, even if more costly. Now the  greatest problems have come up in these areas.    Chernoplekov: Russia will inevitably produce a  certain amount of talent per unit of time per unit of space. In  accordance with the conditions that we will bring about, talents  will be distributed: political, military, scientific... We know  that in Germany after the war at one time science was wiped out.  Talented young people were leaving the country. And now when we  travel to Germany we see that kids and people returning from the  West are working in science there. There is almost no middle  link. We should understand this and make efforts to avoid it.    Belyayev: And how do we keep our young people for  science? I do not agree that it is such a tragedy that young  specialists are going over to the West. I don't know what is  better: going off and retaining what they have while developing  in science, or staying here and not getting into it at all. And  why believe that none of them will ever return, and that we will  not reap the benefit for our science from what they are now  doing? The large contingent of our former citizens who are now  living in Israel opens up a broad exit to other fields and  nations, and we ought to take advantage of it. Thousands of  Chinese are scattered throughout the world, and China is now  getting a lot from its compatriots, they are bringing their  potential to the homeland.</p>

			<p><P> January 23, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CHRYSLER MAY POST $1.20-PER-SHARE LOSS;  </P> <P> AUTO INDUSTRY: THE COLLAPSING MARKET AND THE BRUISING COMPETITION ARE BLAMED  FOR THE COMPANY'S EXPECTED REPORT. FORD AND GM ARE ALSO EXPECTED TO HAVE LOWER  FOURTH-QUARTER EARNINGS.  </P> <P> Chrysler Corp., retrenching in the face of a slumping and bruisingly  competitive auto market, is expected to report a large loss for the fourth  quarter, its first since 1982, industry analysts said today.  </P> <P> They said Chrysler's poor performance underscores the dreary state of the U.S.  auto industry in 1989, a year in which sales -- boosted by generous but costly  incentives -- were strong for much of the period but collapsed dramatically  toward the end.  </P> <P> General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co., the other Big Three U.S. auto makers,  also had a rough time and are expected to report lower fourth-quarter earnings,  the analysts said.  </P> <P> They said Chrysler could report a loss of as much as $280 million, or about  $1.20 a share, in the final three months of 1989, mainly because of more than  $300-million worth of write-offs attributed to staff cutbacks and a plant  closing.  </P> <P> "Chrysler will be several hundred million dollars in the red after the  write-offs," said independent auto analyst David Healy.  </P> <P> The company is expected to report fourth-quarter results on Feb. 13, and Ford  and GM will report later that week.  </P> <P> The last time Chrysler lost money was in the fourth quarter of 1982, when it  had a deficit of about $96 million.  </P> <P> Chrysler's present difficulties have prompted some comparisons with its  situation in the early 1980s, when it was struggling back from near-bankruptcy  and the entire U.S. auto industry was mired in recession.  </P> <P> Analysts say that it is now a stronger company but that the auto market it  faced in 1989 was one of the most treacherous in years.  </P> <P> The annual selling rate in December fell as low as 5.5 million cars, a level  analysts consider recessionary.  </P> <P> Chrysler responded by drastically cutting production, temporarily closing 42 of  62 assembly plants in the United States and Canada in January alone.  </P> <P> At Chrysler, the anticipated write-offs are strictly accounting measures, and  on an operating basis the company will probably break even or earn up to 9  cents a share in the last quarter of 1989, analysts said.  </P> <P> But this is a pittance compared to the $1.85 a share earned in the same period  in 1988, or the $1.19 and $1.56 expected by Shearson Lehman Hutton analyst  Joseph Phillippi for GM and Ford respectively.  </P> <P> Despite the expected losses, analysts say the write-offs are as well-timed as  they could be, given the dismal state of the auto business. "1989 turned out to  be a very difficult year. You might as well take as many charges as you can,"  Phillippi said.  </P> <P> U.S. car sales bounced back in this month's most recent period, but analysts  remain cautious about the industry's 1990 prospects, given the continued high  levels of unsold cars on dealer lots.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 13, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> LANDFILL HEARINGS  </P> <P> The juxtaposition of the two articles "Realtor Convicted on 2 Tax Charges" and  "Hearing on Landfill Site Report Scheduled" on Oct. 20 is a sad commentary on  priorities in reporting.  </P> <P> We are grappling with a seriously irreversible issue: Shall we fill our  endangered and beautiful urban canyons with "killer trash" while we criticize  other nations for destroying their rain forests?  </P> <P> Over 80 people signed up to speak at the hearing; only 24 were heard by 10 p.m.  We asked for a continuation so that the complex "Integrated Solid Waste  Management System" document could have full public review. We also asked for an  extended time for written comments so many groups not notified officially could  express themselves.  </P> <P> Not one NIMBY (Not in My Back Yard) argument emerged in that meeting. People  were opposed to landfills anywhere. Most were supporting recycling now. Veteran  community activists are watching this process and wondering if this might not  be an initiative issue. Then our elected officials would really find out how  their constituents feel.  </P> <P> JILL SWIFT, Tarzana  </P></p>

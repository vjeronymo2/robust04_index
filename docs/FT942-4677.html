			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: More transparency urged for London bullion market The London bullion market should become more transparent if it does not want to lose ground to New York, the Financial Times World Gold Conference was told in London yesterday. Mr James Riley, a partner with J. Aron &amp; Company/Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co, said failure to make the market more open would ensure that New York, where Comex trades gold futures, would 'remain the home to gold price transparency'. While the London fix provided the benchmark for physical gold, 'no-one knows the turnover on a fix'. Mr Riley also predicted a rise in the gold price to Dollars 414 a troy ounce this year as gold began to be treated once more as a long-term asset, rather than as a commodity. He cited a report that Fidelity, a leading US fund, had 4 per cent of its assets in commodities. Mr Victor von Klemperer, senior manager with Dresdner Bank, suggested that the Bundesbank, which holds almost 3,000 tonnes of gold, was looking seriously at mobilising some of its reserves following the budget deficit pressures 'brought on by the horrendous costs of reunification'. 'This topic will obviously gain in actuality in a year when they don't have a DM18bn surplus to transfer to the finance ministry,' he told the conference. Mr Norbert Schroff, a senior precious metals manager at Credit Suisse, said Zurich was the premier physical gold market. In the past 10 years it had imported an average of between 1,200 and 1,400 tonnes, and exported between 1,000 and 1,200 tonnes. The level of imports was equivalent to 70 per cent of western mine production and 40 per cent of total world supplies. 'It is clear from these figures that Zurich is holding its own not only as the centre of gold trade in Switzerland, but also as the world's principal trading arena for physical gold,' he said. Mr Timothy Green, chief consultant with Gold Fields Mineral Services, said that physical demand for gold in the Middle East and India had accepted the higher trading range of around Dollars 380 an ounce more quickly than expected. 'I happened to be in Jeddah earlier this year when the price slipped momentarily to Dollars 375. Jeddah ran out of physical gold that day as people covered unfixed positions. And from then on I was much less concerned about the downside risk of the price.' Mr Robert Ashley, director and head of treasury at Rothschild Australia, said that although Chinese gold consumption was down last year by about 30 tonnes, its consumption of 325 tonnes made it the second biggest consumer behind the US. He pointed out that prosperity continued to increase, with Chinese bank savings passing USDollars 100bn. There were about 800m farmers who had not yet bought gold. With inflation at 22 per cent and the political uncertainty that would attend the post-Deng Xao Ping era, gold would benefit from its status as a reliable store of wealth. 'In the 1920s and 1930s Shanghai was the third largest gold market behind London and New York,' he said. 'The influence of China in the market in 1993 demonstrated that it is regaining lost ground.' Mr Yuri Mityuk, head of treasury at the Bank for Foreign Trade of the Russian Federation, said the Russian gold mining industry was expected to produce 150 to 155 tonnes this year, compared with 149.5 tonnes in 1993. This could be considered a sign that the bottom in Russian production had been reached. He said the Russian finance ministry was eager to help the industry and suggested that cuts in both the number and level of both federal and local taxes would promote new investment and increase efficiency.</p>

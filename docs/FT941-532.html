			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Kazakh leader urges CIS union The Kazakh president, Mr Nursulatan Nazarbayev, yesterday called for a stronger 'Euro-Asian union' among members of the Commonwealth of Independent States. Mr Nazarbayev, urging a union with a common currency and parliament, spoke a day after the head of Russia's upper parliamentary chamber, Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, similarly suggested that there should be 'closer integration' within the CIS. Under reintegration accords between Russia and Kazakhstan announced on Monday, the two states will be establishing a joint enterprise to conduct oil drilling in Kazakhstan's part of the Caspian Sea, it emerged yesterday. The agreements also gave Russia full territorial rights over Baikonur Cosmodrome, in Kazakhstan, which was the ex-Soviet Union's only launchpad for manned space flights, at a rent of Dollars 115m (Pounds 79m) a year, down from Kazakhstan's earlier demand of Dollars 7bn. Meanwhile, Russia dropped its demand that Kazakhstan grant ethnic Russians dual citizenship. Steve LeVine, Moscow.</p>

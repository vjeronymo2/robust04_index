			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by 'Adnan Husayn: "Clashes in Mosul and Explosions </F> in Baghdad"]    [Text] The Iraqi Dispatch Authority, which is close to the  opposition "[Unified] Iraqi National Congress [UINC]," has said  that fighting broke out on the morning of the day before  yesterday among Iraqi Army units in Mosul, which is situated in  the area adjacent to the Kurdish region. It added that the  roads linking Mosul with the Kurdish cities of Dahuk, Irbil, and  Karkuk were closed after the start of the fighting, in which it  said "the commander of a brigade from the al-Jubur tribe and  another from al-Ghazlaniyyin tribe" participated.    Al-Jubur officers were one of the influential blocs in the  Iraqi Army until two years ago when a group of them were accused  of planning to overthrow and kill President Saddam Husayn.  Scores of them were executed and hundreds subsequently  dismissed from service.    A UINC official told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT over the telephone  yesterday from his office in Salah al-Din in Iraqi Kurdistan  that the roads between Mosul and the Kurdish areas were reopened  yesterday and that he had received information that clashes took  place a few days ago among Iraqi military units stationed around  Karkuk.    The Iraqi Dispatch Authority said that "three successive  explosions occurred in Baghdad 30 May." And that the first  explosion occurred "in Saddam Husayn's new house in Corniche  al-A'zamiyah" on the Tigris River and the second "in the Ba'th  Party's headquarters in al-A'zamiyah."    On the situation in the Kurdish areas UINC sources said that  the fighting among the warring Kurdish militias has stopped in  the Halabjah area adjacent to the border with Iran. And that  the cease-fire and disengagement of the forces were holding in  the Qal'at Dizah area yesterday.</p>

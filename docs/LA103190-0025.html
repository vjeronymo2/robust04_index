			<p><P> October 31, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ECONOMIC OUTPUT UP MORE THAN EXPECTED, STILL WEAK  </P> <P> The nation's economy grew somewhat more strongly than expected during the third  quarter of this year, the government reported Tuesday, but the expansion still  was anemic and did not alter predictions that the nation may be headed for a  modest recession.  </P> <P> Commerce Department figures showed that the real gross national product, the  broadest measure of the economy's output, expanded at a surprising 1.8% annual  rate from July through September, after a second-quarter pace of 0.4%.  </P> <P> But analysts warned that the figures are preliminary and do not include the  full effects of the crisis in the Persian Gulf, which has raised crude oil  prices sharply, dampening the economy. The impact of that did not hit until  late September.  </P> <P> The Bush Administration was circumspect about the report. Michael J. Boskin,  the President's chief economist, said that, although the new figures are  "pleasant news about the third quarter, we are concerned about a sluggish  fourth quarter and the early part of 1991."  </P> <P> A broad range of analysts said they still expect the economy to fall into a  recession during the last three months of this year, though there are sharp  differences over how long -- or how severe -- it will be. Most forecasters had  expected that the economy would grow at an annual rate of 0.8% for the third  quarter.  </P> <P> Allen Sinai, chief economist of The Boston Co., a New York financial firm, said  the third-quarter figure "was not a false reading on GNP" but "is a false  reading on the state of the economy as a whole."  </P> <P> Irwin L. Kellner, chief economist for Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. in New  York, agreed. "The GNP has not caught up with the real world, and the real  world tells a different story," Kellner said.  </P> <P> "The question is not whether we are in recession, but how long -- and how bad?"  </P> <P> Tuesday's report is expected to ease pressure on the Federal Reserve Board to  push interest rates down. Although the Fed nudged one target rate down slightly  Monday, it has been reluctant to go further for fear of exacerbating inflation.  </P> <P> The figures came as the department reported separately that sales of new  single-family homes fell a steep 6% in September -- another sign of weakening  in the economy. The decline followed a 1.8% drop in August.  </P> <P> As had been expected, the decline in new home sales was uneven. Total sales  plunged 15.6% in the hard-hit Northeast but dipped only 0.7% in the Western and  Mountain states. Economists said the housing industry generally has been in a  mini-recession.  </P> <P> Despite the continued bearishness among economists, analysts said the  third-quarter report contained evidence that the economy had not weakened as  much as had been widely believed before the Persian Gulf crisis began:  </P> <P>  -- Confounding expectations, consumer spending rebounded last summer --  particularly for big-ticket items such as automobiles and light trucks -- with  overall consumption up at a 3.6% annual rate, after a 0.4% pace in the previous  quarter.  </P> <P>  -- Stockpiles of unsold goods, which some analysts feared would be rising so  precipitously that they would prompt cutbacks in new production later this  year, actually rose at a slower pace last quarter than in the spring.  </P> <P>  -- Spending on durable goods, which fell at an alarming 9.5% rate during the  second quarter of the year, recovered smartly during the July-September period,  rising at a respectable 3.6% rate.  </P> <P>  -- And capital spending by business -- often a harbinger of industrial  expansion -- also grew robustly. Business spending on new plant construction  rose at an annual rate of 5.1%, after a 9% dip in the spring. Corporate  spending on equipment soared at an 8.2% rate.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, analysts cautioned that the outlook will remain uncertain until  economists can measure the impact of the gulf crisis, which will show up in  reports covering late September and October.  </P> <P> For example, analysts said that the pickup in automobile sales, which accounted  for the bulk of the rebound in consumer spending during the quarter, stemmed  largely from rebates and dealer incentives that well may have spurred buying  artificially. They said auto sales most likely will fall off again in the  fourth quarter.  </P> <P> Lynn Reaser, economist at First Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles, said the  situation "is not quite one of an economy that is collapsing, but of one that  is quite weak" and might well decline at a 1% annual rate in the fourth quarter  of the year.  </P> <P> "This GNP report may overstate the strength of the economy last summer, but it  may not be so bad going into the fourth quarter as it is pictured," Reaser  said. "Perhaps the pendulum had too sharp a swing from optimism a few months  ago to pessimism now."  </P> <P> Even so, Giulio Martini, an economist at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. in New  York, contended that the third-quarter numbers were more impressive than  economists seemed to think and could mean that any coming downturn will be  mild.  </P> <P> "I would not dismiss this number," Martini said in a telephone interview. "We  had good demand growth and lean inventories . . . . So despite credit and  financial problems and the real estate slump, this reflects an economy that can  absorb them.  </P> <P> But Richard W. Rahn, economist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, predicted that  Tuesday's figures will be revised downward sharply as the government updates  its initial estimates with later information, and that the slump will begin in  earnest later this year.  </P> <P> He also predicted that inflation ultimately will prove to have been more  virulent than the initial estimates have shown.  </P> <P> "Analysts who expected the recession to start in the third quarter are one  quarter off," Rahn declared.  </P> <P> For all the apparent improvements, Tuesday's report also showed a slight rise  in the rate of inflation. The GNP deflator index, the broadest measure of  inflation, rose at a 4.1% annual rate during the quarter, up from 3.9% from  April through June.  </P> <P> But analysts cautioned that such measures may be misleading because they play  down the increase in the price of oil imports. They said that, when petroleum  imports are included in the computation, the inflation figure for the period  rises to a 5% annual rate.  </P> <P> The report showed that U.S. exports continued to grow robustly at an annual  rate of 1.2% but that imports grew by 6%, reflecting increased purchases of  foreign-made capital goods.  </P></p>

			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Norton to resume production after backers inject CDollars 1m Norton Motors (1993), the beleaguered British motorcycle manufacturer, has been given a one-year lifeline by its Canadian backers. The company, which almost collapsed last month following a row among its Vancouver-based owners, has been promised a cash injection of at least CDollars 1m (Pounds 400,000) to restart production at its Midlands plant. Norton's shareholders - led by Franmar Development Corporation, a Canadian investment group - agreed the financial package following talks with the company's UK managers. Mr Matthew Markham, a Franmar director, said the funds could be used to build a final batch of 100 motorcycles using Norton's rotary engine technology. 'If successful, we may invest more money on developing new piston engine models,' he added. Fears over the long-term future of Norton rose last month after Ms Rozanda Skalbania, who had been managing the UK plant, left the company. If the company survives, Mr Markham said it would consider raising fresh finance in North America, where Norton BSA - a shell company - could seek a Nasdaq listing.</p>

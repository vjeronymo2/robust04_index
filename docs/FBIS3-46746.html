The ministry said the net flow of money from the  government's  coffers into the private sector was the second largest on record  next to about 7.4 trillion yen recorded in the same period of  1981. Its announcement was based on the balance of receipts and  payments of treasury funds with the private sector.    On the general account, tax revenues during the period  decreased by 2,821.2 billion yen from the like period last year  while expenditures for public works projects increased 534.2  billion yen.    Social insurance spending also climbed by 220.7 billion yen,  it said.    Outside the general account, an increase in housing loans  and  massive dollar buying by the Bank of Japan to prevent the yen's  appreciation helped boost the net outflow of fiscal funds.</p>

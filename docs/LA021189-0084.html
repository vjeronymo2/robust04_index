			<p><P> February 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> PARKENING OFFERS SIMPLE GIFTS  </P> <P> Perhaps it was fitting that guitarist Christopher Parkening closed his recital  at Ambassador Auditorium Thursday night with a satisfying arrangement of the  Shaker hymn " 'Tis a Gift to Be Simple."  </P> <P> Although the 12 short works, two suites and eight collaborations with guitarist  David Brandon aptly demonstrated Parkening's non-aggressive style, mastery over  a wide range of effects and a prodigiously controlled pianissimo and sul  ponticello, there were few enterprising efforts. Reading throughout from scores  placed on a nearby music stand, Parkening opted for works that were either very  familiar or were simple enough not to require extra rehearsing.  </P> <P> Moreno's "Suite Castillos de Espana" proceeded seamlessly, driving heroically  to the final "Turegano," while Sor's Variations on a Theme by Mozart showcased  an impressive array of ornate passages. But a lack of concentration and focus  marred the performance of a transcription of a suite from Praetorius'  "Terpsichore."  </P> <P> Other works such as Tarrega's tremolo study "Recuerdos de la Alhambra," two  preludes and an etude by Villa-Lobos and two short transcriptions of Albeniz  piano pieces were all mastered with the right amount of control and expression.  Three selections from Segovia's arrangements of the Bach Cello Suites were less  convincing and at times even found Parkening struggling with accuracy.  </P> <P> Of the works performed with Brandon, the Prelude No. 4 from Mario  Castelnuovo-Tedesco's "Les Guitares Bien Temperees" (1962) was the evening's  best example of expressive, lush Romanticism, albeit performed routinely. An  excessively easy transcription of Two Renaissance Dances From the "Fitzwilliam  Virginal Book" also provided moments of interest.  </P></p>

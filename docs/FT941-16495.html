			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: A proper role for government Sir, Mr Herbert E Meyer (Letters, January 1/2) argues that the proper role for government in creating economic growth is to establish ground rules while entrepreneurs make growth happen. Perhaps one of the proper roles for government, as automation increases and the requirement for employees decreases, will be to ensure a reasonably equitable distribution of those employment opportunities which exist?

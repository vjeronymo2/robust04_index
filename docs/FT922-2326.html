			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Letter: Objection to Lloyd's levy Sir, When I joined Lloyd's in 1986 my agents and interviewer took great pains to stress the real nature of the unlimited underwriting liability which I was assuming. However, it was never suggested to me by anyone, nor was it apparent from the literature I received, that I was also writing a blank cheque to the Council of Lloyd's. It may be the case that the council can properly increase the central fund subscription in the way and for the purpose proposed without the Members' consent, but it seems to me, as a matter of law, highly unlikely. In any event I do not regard a rather unspecific statement by the Lloyd's chairman that it is entitled to do so as sufficient. With reluctance, therefore, I propose to decline to pay the levy unless and until I am satisfied that I am under a legal obligation to do so.

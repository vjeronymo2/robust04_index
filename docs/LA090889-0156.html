			<p><P> September 8, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> REAGAN TO HAVE SURGERY TO REMOVE FLUID ON BRAIN  </P> <P> Former President Ronald Reagan will undergo surgery this weekend to remove  fluid on his brain that apparently resulted from his horseback riding accident  two months ago, a spokesman said today.  </P> <P> The fluid was found during a routine exam at the Mayo Clinic, said Mark  Weinberg, a spokesman for the 78-year-old former President.  </P> <P> "President Reagan was found to have a small collection of fluid on top of the  right side of his brain," Weinberg said. "Physicians believe this is a direct  result of President Reagan being thrown by a wild horse in July in Mexico.  </P> <P> "Although President Reagan has not experienced any symptoms, physicians have  advised this fluid be removed in a routine procedure which will be performed at  St. Marys Hospital, a Mayo Foundation hospital, this weekend," Weinberg said.  </P> <P> He added that Reagan's treatment is being managed by Mayo Clinic physicians,  who said that he is otherwise in excellent health. Reagan's wife, Nancy, who  also underwent routine tests, was found to be in excellent health, Weinberg  said.  </P> <P> The pair arrived in Minnesota from Bel-Air on Wednesday and checked into the  clinic Thursday. They left the clinic this morning.  </P></p>

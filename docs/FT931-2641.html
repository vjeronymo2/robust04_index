			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Chelsea fans offered chance to save ground Supporters of Chelsea Football Club are being given the chance to buy shares in a new company being set up to eventually acquire the club's Stamford Bridge ground in London. The new company, Chelsea Pitch Owners, is offering nearly 70,000 shares at Pounds 100 each to the public. The money will be used to buy the ground from Royal Bank of Scotland, which acquired it when former owner Cabra Estates went into liquidation last November. RBS granted Chelsea a 20-year lease and an offer to buy which expires in 2012. Directors of CPO include Mr Tony Banks, MP for Newham North West, and Mr Dennis Wise, the Chelsea player.</p>

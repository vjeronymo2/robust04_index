			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Allied-Lyons leasing plan to proceed ALLIED-LYONS, the drinks, food, and retailing group, yesterday confirmed that it intends to go ahead with its plan to lease 734 pubs to Brent Walker, the debt-laden leisure group. The deal, which is vital to Brent Walker's financial restructuring, will be sealed in spite of a warning from the Office of Fair Trading that the leased pubs would still be counted as part of Allied's tied estate. Allied, which has to free 2,380 pubs from tied beer supplies by November to comply with government orders, said its legal advice was that the 734 pubs would count towards that disposal target. Under the terms of the deal, Allied will buy 50 pubs from Brent Walker and supply two thirds of the beer requirements of its remaining 1,800 pubs for seven years. If the OFT should be successful in persuading the courts that the 734 pubs are still 'tied' after the November disposal deadline, Allied and Brent Walker have agreed a fall-back position to safeguard Allied's position. This involves varying the duration and volume of the beer supply agreement and the leasehold rents of the pubs.</p>

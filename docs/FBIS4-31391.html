			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Parliament Chairman Stipe Mesic by Jovo </F> Paripovic; place and date not given: "The HDZ Has a Hard Time  Coping With Democracy"]    [Text] "There need not be a parliamentary and state crisis  in Croatia, but there could be if unreasonable moves are made.  Some of the reasons why we undertook to form the new party of  Independent Croatian Democrats [HND] were the war in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, the functioning of the law-governed state,  the activity of the parliament, and the autonomy of the  judiciary. We did not like the structure of the HDZ [Croatian  Democratic Union], which has been turned into a bureaucratic  organization that does not beat with a democratic pulse. Our  move can only promote democracy, provided there is reason and  the country is not pushed into crisis. This can only help  Croatia to become more recognizable as a democratic society,"  Stipe Mesic explained the most recent political ferment for all  NEDELJNA BORBA.    [Paripovic] How do you perceive the behavior of the HDZ and  the president himself, Dr. Tudjman, following your move and that  of Josip Manolic, president of the Chamber of Zupanijas?    [Mesic] The HDZ has had trouble coping with that basic  postulate of democracy that people think differently about  different problems. And when we were unable to fight for our  positions within the party, we went public. That is why  proceedings were immediately instituted to dismiss Mr. Manolic.  I do not know how many deputies signed the motion for my  dismissal. That is already pass now. That is deja vu: An order  is issued from the president's office, and everything is set in  motion. That is not a feature of democratic societies. Relations  in parliament are different because of the new party's  establishment, and we have proposed that we sit down and reach  an agreement on the leadership of the parliament. This cannot be  done through pressure.    [Paripovic] Did you expect reactions of that kind, which, as  you say, are those familiar from the time that is now behind us?    [Mesic] I can say that I did expect it. As more and more  time  has passed, the party has hewed more and more to the model of  the one-party system and has begun to beat with that pulse. This  is not satisfactory to us. On the contrary, we have begun to  shut ourselves off not with a Berlin Wall, but a Balkan wall.  The president's office has been turned into a power center. It  is possible from there to manipulate all the moves in  parliament, even to decide on the choice of judges. Or indeed  the name to be given to some club. That is not the president's  affair.    [Paripovic] What are the sources of that kind of behavior?  Does it come from President Tudjman or from the people who  surround him?    [Mesic] Certainly there are several reasons. One is  certainly  the people around the president. They only became acquainted  with him as the chief of state, while I, instead of their  deference, have always presented my opinion to Tudjman without  calculating whether he will take to it or not. The people around  him have been telling him what they thought he wanted to hear.  That is why he has been drawing the wrong conclusions, since the  information he based them on was wrong. To some extent the fault  is surely also his.    [Paripovic] How do yo assess the position of Franjo Tudjman?  Since the move by you and Josip Manolic has he been uncertain  what course to take, or "standing firm on his feet"?    [Mesic] I think he is not taking the right steps as soon as  he moves against parliament. A war between the executive and  legislative branches does not benefit democracy. In addition to  preserving the position of the parliament, we also want to  preserve the Office of the President, but only within the limits  allowed him by the Constitution.    [Paripovic] Is it your assessment that you can remain at the  head of the Croatian parliament? President Tudjman was explicit  at his regular news conference that that post is reserved for a  representative of the HDZ?    [Mesic] That will depend on the balance of power or an  agreement among all factors in the parliament. If we agree to  let that post go to the HDZ, we will let it go, but this cannot  be settled over the telephone, not by gathering signatures, by  raising an uproar. That is the Bolshevik syndrome.    [Paripovic] How do you see the destiny of the government?    [Mesic] The government has our support for the present. It  has solved the problem of inflation.    [Paripovic] What if the opposition should gain the upper  hand  in the parliament?    [Mesic] Everything depends on how the government behaves.    [Paripovic] What are the things you have against President  Tudjman and the HDZ in connection with the war in  Bosnia-Herzegovina?    [Mesic] There are several culprits to blame for that war,  and  Milosevic is the biggest. He calculated that with war he could  achieve those objectives of creating an expanded Serbia which  were not achieved earlier. Those who wanted an expanded Croatia  played into his hands. Through the Serbs in Croatia, which Bora  Jovic told me were our problem and we should "do what we like  with them," the fuse of war in Croatia was ignited although  there were assurances that Serbia was interested in only 66  percent of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The only way to achieve that  was to escalate the war in Bosnia and in Herzegovina. And then  we had problems in the division of Bosnia and Herzegovina, since  if a Serbian republic was being created, so let's also create a  Croatia in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Herzeg-Bosna was created with  flags, its army, its government... as a response to the Serbian  side. We opposed such moves, since it means disintegration of an  internationally recognized entity.    [Paripovic] You are probably aware of more detailed  information, but you do not wish to speak of it. Can we, then,  deal in suppositions? Did Dr. Tudjman consent to the offer of 66  percent of the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina to the Serbs?    [Mesic] I think not.    [Paripovic] Did that agreement include resettlement of Serbs  and Croats? I would recall for you just two almost identical  such movements of population of both Serbs and Croats in which  both suffered. I am speaking of the Croats who left Ilok and  environs and the Serbs who left western Slavonia?    [Mesic] As soon as the talk turned on humane resettlement of  population, I saw a great danger there. When we see what has  happened, then it is clear that Milosevic had Cyprus in mind as  a model. He went against everything that was non-Serb with  brutal force in order to clear out a space to make expanded  Serbia. He counted on there being pressure on the Serbs from the  other side. He did not take a risk in that respect, but he  longed for that. Whether there was an agreement about that I do  not know. That is another of the questions history will answer  for us, but the fact is that the aim was to create ethnic  borders.    [Paripovic] You have raised quite a few of those issues --  the issue of the money which the diaspora has been paying and  which has disappeared, the question of apartments.... Do you  think that Seks and others who obtained apartments for a song  will simply pay for that or return them? You have raised the  issue of the Mafia and its connection to the authorities,  profiteering, murders.... You said that "they" are true Sisters  of Mercy compared to "these." Do you think you can work that out?    [Mesic] Yes. The money from the diaspora went into certain  accounts. Balance sheets have to be drawn up, so that we can see  how much was spent for what. Distribution of apartments has been  discontinued, and this must be worked out as part of the  operation of the law-governed state, just like everything else  that has been raised as an issue. Unlawful acts must be detected  by those who are paid to do that. The Mafia began in Sicily as a  political movement against the French. But the French departed  long ago, and the Mafia has remained. I hope that this one in  Croatia will be much shorter-lived.    [Paripovic] Will your moves have an effect on Dr. Tudjman  and  his autocratic way of governing the country, and will you remove  some of the manifestations of power which even a monarch would  not be ashamed of: the presidential aircraft, the yacht and,  they say, the immense wealth of the entire Tudjman family?    [Mesic] I assume that Dr. Tudjman is a realistic politician.  Realistic because he came to power precisely by respecting  certain realities. That is why I think he will take the new  realities into account. He must realize that our moves do not  represent a destabilization of Croatia. Accordingly, if he draws  the lessons from all this, it will be better both for him, and  also for democracy and for Croatia.    [Paripovic] Is Defense Minister Gojko Susak one of the  stumbling blocks between Manolic and you on the one hand, and  not just the two of you, and President Tudjman on the other?    [Mesic] Yes. I think he is incompetent.    [Paripovic] But Tudjman continues to keep him close to his  side, and he refers to those demanding his dismissal as "petty  politicians." These days there are people in Croatia who  interpret Tudjman's keeping Susak close by his side even as a  possibility of dictatorship?    [Mesic] I do not believe in solutions outside the  institutional framework. The European environment would hardly  put up with that. Someone would have to stand behind such a  move, just as someone has always stood behind every military  dictatorship introduced up to now. Everything is clear  concerning Susak. His resignation is being demanded. It does not  interest us that he perhaps may have offered his resignation to  Tudjman when they were playing tennis or over coffee. We want  the resignation debated publicly, which does not mean that he  must offer his resignation publicly after the debate.    [Paripovic] Why has Minister Susak become so dear to  Tudjman's heart?    [Mesic] That I do not know.    [Paripovic] There is talk of a Herzegovinian lobby?    [Mesic] I think that there is a bit of exaggeration here  about that Herzegovinian lobby. In every war people emerge who  through their connections make it possible for others and  themselves to get rich. The talk about the Herzegovinians began  following several real cases of that kind, but there are "very  good profiteers" among the Slavonians, those from Lika, the  Dalmatians, and the Istrians.    [Paripovic] According to an assessment which need not be  accurate, your parting of the ways with the HDZ should have  occurred at the last party convention, where differentiation of  what are provisionally referred to as "right" and "left" wings  became evident?    [Mesic] So far the HDZ has responded to two historic  challenges -- the first was leaving the communist system and the  second formation of the Croatian state. It now faces a new  challenge -- what kind of state that should be. Here the HDZ is  not responding effectively enough. That division into "left" and  "right" is artificial, and when anyone wanted to discredit us,  then they simply referred to us as "on the left." It is not  about that, but about who favors the law-governed and democratic  state and who does not. Here the HDZ should draw the new  lessons, not resort to Bolshevik models of the harangue, or bus  in those who call us "heretics" and call for them to deal with  us. That is not good for the HDZ, since it is now "tackling the  external and internal enemy." That does not disturb us, and I am  sorry that we recognize certain strivings in the HDZ which  aspire to totalitarianism. Some people have grabbed up all the  goods of this world, and they are not waiting to have those  goods in the other world. They would like to set certain things  in cement. The firm hand suits them at present, since any  democratic thrust could take quite a bit of that back from them.    [Paripovic] Your mention of cement has given me my cue: Are  you ready to take some of the responsibility in all this upon  yourself for certain moves? Surely you are not taking it for  granted that many will treat you with kid gloves in the session  of the parliament?    [Mesic] They have never treated me with kid gloves. Even  since 1963. I was in prison in Stara Gradiska, because I did not  agree with the totalitarian system. Those totalitarians are now  emerging once again. Those who persecuted me then are now  orthodox members of the HDZ. But I will not mention names, since  we have an agreement to that effect. There will not be any kid  gloves, but I am not afraid of that, since the arguments are on  our side. We have on our side public opinion in spite of  Vrdoljak's television. And when you talk about cement, than I  know that you are referring to the story that I wanted to buy my  daughter a cement plant. She wanted to mortgage her house to go  into that business, but that was abandoned. I have only what I  have earned, and I have not gained anything from this regime.    [Paripovic] You say that public opinion is also with you.  Can  you conclude from that that the people are fed up with this  regime?    [Mesic] The people are never completely satisfied with their  state. And that is a good thing. But the people are bothered by  those who are abusing the state. There is no danger of the state  being destabilized. On the contrary -- the mafiosi will be  destabilized and exposed.  <H5>  [Box, p 10] </H5> <H5>  I Will Not Cut a Deal With Tudjman </H5>   [Paripovic] Have you had contacts with President Tudjman,  and  can it be said that a deal is being cut?    [Mesic] I have had talks with two representatives who came  on  the president's behalf. A third was supposed to come, but he  went away on a business trip. What they are offering is  bilateral talks. We are offering the opposition on the one side  and the HDZ on the other, since now we belong to the opposition.  I think that bilateral bargaining does not come under  consideration now -- that is the message I sent back to the  president. Positions should not be held onto jealously. I was  not born in the position of president of the parliament, nor  need I remain there. In the HDZ, and this is what their  propaganda says, they are thinking that this is a power  struggle. If that were the case, I would just go sit down  alongside Tudjman, since under the Constitution I am his deputy,  and for me personally everything could come up roses. But I am  not dealing with my personal problems now. I want Croatia to be  a democratic country.  <H5>  [Box, p 10] </H5> <H5>  "Agreement" Concerning the War </H5>   [Paripovic] What were Franjo Tudjman's motives in  negotiating  with Milosevic at Karadjordjevo if he did not also have a desire  for some expanded state?    [Mesic] Through Bora Jovic I proposed that we sit down  together, he and Milosevic, Dr. Tudjman and I, and attempt to  avoid war. An hour later Bora told me that he had passed on  everything to Milosevic and the latter had agreed to the  proposal. I passed that on to Tudjman, but I soon learned that  only Tudjman and Milosevic would meet. I do not know what they  agreed on, but we have seen how processes developed and how the  war escalated.</p>

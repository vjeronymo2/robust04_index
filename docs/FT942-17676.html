			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / Stronger growth forecast for Netherlands economy The Dutch economy is poised to enjoy substantially stronger growth in 1995, putting two years of more sluggish performance behind it, according to new official forecasts. The Central Planning Bureau, a government-run agency which produces independent economic assessments, said that gross domestic product should rise to 2.5 per cent next year from a projected 1.0 per cent this year and 0.3 per cent in 1993. But, in a cautionary note, it said the increase would be due mainly to higher exports, with domestic consumption expected to remain relatively weak. Inflation, which was virtually non-existent in the Netherlands in the late 1980s, is forecast to pick up slightly, reaching 2.75 per cent this year and next year compared with 2.6 per cent last year. However, in spite of the stronger performance of the economy as a whole, unemployment is expected to continue rising, with the number of jobless people forecast to rise to 630,000 in 1995 compared with 550,000 last year. The upturn in the Netherlands is likely to be part of a wider upward trend in Europe, the CPB said in its annual spring report. 'The lowest point of the recession in Europe has been passed, in our opinion,' Mr Gerrit Zalm, the CPB's director, said. Dutch exports, excluding energy products, are projected to recover from their 0.1 per cent dip in 1993 to increase by 3.75 per cent in 1994 and then rise to 5.75 per cent in 1995, reflecting expectations of more buoyant world trade. The Netherlands generates around half of its gross national product through the export of goods and services. The Dutch economy which has traditionally been tied to that of Germany, its biggest trading partner, has avoided the recession that has plagued its eastern neighbour in the early 1990s.</p>

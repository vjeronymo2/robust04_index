			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / Row splits Italian investigators MR Francesco Saverio Borrelli, the leading magistrate behind Italy's 18-month political corruption investigation, will have to take urgent action to restore the credibility of his magistrates when he returns to Milan today. Deep divisions emerged among magistrates after the revelation last week that Mr Marcello Stefanini, treasurer of the Democratic Party of the Left (PDS), the former Communist Party (PCI), had been told he was under investigation for alleged corruption and illegal political funding. The PDS has consistently denied involvement in the bribes which have tainted almost all Italy's big political parties. Two magistrates argued on newspaper front pages over whether investigators had deliberately held back from pursuing allegations against the PDS and the Communists. Ms Tiziana Parenti, the magistrate investigating the PDS, complained she had been isolated by her colleagues. The interview provoked a sharp response from Mr Gerardo d'Ambrosio, Milan's assistant public attorney, who has been running matters in Mr Borrelli's absence on holiday. Mr d'Ambrosio played down the allegations against Mr Stefanini, a PDS senator who was treasurer of the Communist Party before its metamorphosis into the PDS. Mr Stefanini was alleged to have been the intended recipient of L621m (Dollars 390,000) paid by Calcestruzzi, the building materials subsidiary of the Ferruzzi group, to Mr Primo Greganti, a former PCI official. The money was alleged to have been a bribe in return for contracts won by Calcestruzzi from the Enel electricity generating authority. While not denying the existence of the Swiss bank account into which the money was paid, Mr Greganti, arrested this year, has consistently denied the cash was for the PCI.</p>

We believe the  visit will push the traditional friendly cooperative relations  between the two countries to a new height."    Jiang Zemin said: In the past year, historical changes have  taken place in Cambodia. Under the leadership of King Sihanouk,  the country, which had undergone chaos caused by war for years,  has entered the stage of restoration and reconstruction. He  said: "Your Majesty has consistently stood for the realization  of a comprehensive national reconciliation in Cambodia. We  appreciate Your Majesty's unrelenting efforts to achieve this  goal and we pay tribute to Your Majesty's patriotism in showing  concern for the country and people. We sincerely hope that  under King Sihanouk's leadership, the various political parties  in Cambodia will set store by national interests, unite, and  properly settle domestic problems by peaceful means, and build  Cambodia into an independent, peaceful, unified, integrated, and  prosperous country. We also hope that the efforts made by the  international community will be helpful in promoting Cambodia's  national reconciliation, peace, and stability in the country."    Jiang Zemin said: "The people of China and Cambodia have had  a long-term traditional friendship.

Your Majesty has visited  China many times, cherishes a deep affection for China, and has  made valuable contributions to developing friendly relations  between the two countries.

The Cambodian people  will never forget this.

			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / C&amp;W to raim at Asia-Pacific region Cable and Wireless, the UK telecommunications group, intends to make the Asia-Pacific region its prime investment focus for the next decade. Mr James Ross, C&amp;W's chief executive, told the FT that a strategy review had made telecoms growth opportunities in the Asia-Pacific the company's chief priority. He said the 'medium-term objective' was to devote the free cash flow of Hong Kong Telecom, which is 57.5 per cent owned by C&amp;W, to investment in the Asia-Pacific region, allowing for a 'proper dividend' to the group. That implies a large concentration of investment in the Asia-Pacific region, since HK Telecom last year accounted for nearly two-thirds of C&amp;W's Pounds 829m operating profit, although the Asia-Pacific region accounted for only 44 per cent of C&amp;W's turnover. He added that C&amp;W did not attach 'high priority' to the rush to international telecoms alliances led by British Telecommunications and American Telephone &amp; Telegraph. 'C&amp;W is a federation in its own right, and we don't need others just to give us a global capacity,' he said. In Europe, Mr Ross affirmed C&amp;W's determination to pursue opportunities as the European Union liberalises telecommunications services. Pulling the pearls together, Page 20</p>

			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / Management: Quantum Leap into the dark - Alcoa has turned conventional wisdom on its head as part of a radical reorganisation Paul O'Neill is giving one of America's oldest, most hide-bound and hierarchical corporations the biggest management shake-up in its history. From his position as chairman of the Aluminium Company of America (Alcoa), he suggests that the world's biggest aluminium producer - like too many other companies - has been following ideas rooted in the industrial revolution. Companies attempt to establish standard patterns and practise them uniformly anywhere in the world. Their purpose is to 'eliminate the upsets that come from human beings and to make things ever more mechanical and robotised'. O'Neill suggests: 'The value of that model is exhausted. The model of the future for a company like ours is one where there is a framework that is understood and accepted by managers and employees but where there is an expectation of local initiative and creativity and testing the boundaries, rather than doing what somebody orders from thousands of miles away.' To this end O'Neill has inverted the conventional management pyramid at Alcoa. Instead of having the chairman at the top and the production group at the bottom, O'Neill has put the customers at the top with the operating units - the wealth-creators - directly beneath. Each layer then supports the one above and O'Neill sees himself at the bottom. Rather than the usual chain of command, the heads of each of Alcoa's 25 business units have been given considerable responsibility to manage their operations in their own way. They report to O'Neill and also have the help of a three-strong team of 'counsellors', all previously senior vice presidents. When the FT last looked in depth at the company a year ago, O'Neill had told his business unit managers to analyse the performance of their best competitors and he had given them two years to get to 80 per cent of that 'best'. He estimated then that by 1995 the so-called Quantum Leap programme would add Dollars 1bn to Alcoa's operating profits. Now, half way through the programme, O'Neill is taking stock of progress. In his office in one corner of the 30th floor of Alcoa's headquarters building in Pittsburgh, O'Neill seems a happy man. A small, energetic person, he frequently swings his chair away from his desk to grab a 'mouse' to bring up statistics to prove a point on the computer screen behind him. He is now confident that, rather than an extra Dollars 1bn from the Quantum Leap, Alcoa could reap an extra Dollars 2-3bn in operating earnings - 'if we could operate at the limit of our potential'. Alcoa's best achievement so far was operating earnings of Dollars 1.4bn in 1989. 'In many respects they (Alcoa business unit managers) have exceeded both mine and their own expectations about the level of changes they could make and the pace at which they could make them,' says O'Neill. Alcoa's size - 157 locations worldwide - makes it impossible to pinpoint exactly how much Quantum Leap has contributed to the company's financial performance so far. But O'Neill is sure that the programme is giving Alcoa an edge on its competitors. One reason the programme is going so well, he believes, is because each of the business unit presidents set their own goals. O'Neill says: 'I asked them to give me their ideas on how we could achieve 80 per cent of the world's best practical limits as we know them. They were asked what the measures for the Quantum Leap should be and how they should be attained and the pace at which they should be accomplished. And there was not a single plan that I did not 'buy'. If you leave it to individuals to set their own goals, usually they set goals more difficult than a third party would set for them.' The 'counsellor' system is also working well, says O'Neill. 'This system enables the business unit people to talk to others who have seasoned judgment without feeling they are talking to the boss. They can get a different perspective but they don't have to take the counsellors' advice. We have created a group of 'wise men' for the business unit managers to consult.' Information flows freely around Alcoa via its computer network. If a smelter in Brazil cracks some complicated technical problem, all of Alcoa's other smelters know about it almost immediately. The most important exchanges take place on Friday afternoons when the business unit presidents tap in information about all the most important happenings and trends in their organisations. This information is not just for O'Neill but is available to all senior managers, so the presidents read one another's reports. O'Neill suggests this system makes it almost impossible for an individual to hide any bad news from the others for very long. While the presidents are running their businesses like individual entrepreneurs, O'Neil spends a great deal of his time working on Alcoa's strategy, particularly on its expansion outside the US. 'Alcoa needs to expand significantly outside the US: we continue to look at a lot of things. But we won't jeopardise our financial position for the sake of growth,' says O'Neill. Meanwhile, a year through the Quantum Leap process O'Neill is sure that most of the original goals will be met and 'some will be met far sooner than we expected. In some businesses we have made so much progress that already we are looking at major improvements to the goals set in the last quarter of 1991.'</p>

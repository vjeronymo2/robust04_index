			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / Business and the Environment: The smart way to save energy - A Canadian company is showing utilities the virtues of power conservation Saving energy is generally far cheaper than building new power plant, but convincing consumers of this simple and obvious message takes effort and skilful persuasion. However, a Canadian company has taken on the task of preaching the virtues of power conservation to utilities and energy users around the world. Its scheme has attracted more than 25 utilities, from Mexico to the Czech republic, and others are expected to join soon. Power Smart began as the energy conservation initiative of British Columbia Hydro, the government-owned utility. The company spent CDollars 60m (Pounds 30.7m) developing a wide-ranging package of programmes for its own use, and then realised it could do even better if it worked with other utilities. BC Hydro found that the province's population of 3.5m was not enough to interest manufacturers to go along with its plans. They were reluctant to take the trouble to meet BC Hydro's standards for products such as energy-saving motors, low-power refrigerators or high-efficiency insulation, and then face the same process for the next utility down the road. So BC Hydro set about bringing other utilities into its scheme. It transferred its conservation expertise into a separate company - Power Smart  -two years ago. Now, most of Canada's electrical utilities have signed up, and Power Smart is optimistic about further expansion in eastern Europe, South America and the US, all areas which already have one or more members. In March, the firm signed up its second US member, American Municipal Power-Ohio (AMP-Ohio), which supplies electricity to more than 77 communities. The utilities which have joined vary widely in size. BC Hydro has a capacity of more than 10,000MW, mainly from hydroelectric dams, and supplies more than 1.3m customers. The smallest member, Caribbean Utility Company, on Grand Cayman Island, uses diesel generators with just 71MW of capacity for 12,600 customers. But they all face the same simple economics - it is nearly always cheaper to encourage users to save a kilowatt hour of electricity than it is to build the capacity to generate an extra kilowatt hour. At BC Hydro, which has low power costs, it is estimated to be five times more expensive to increase capacity than to save energy. Nor does the strictly financial cost of expanding capacity include the strains that generating electricity places on the environment. The generic term for schemes such as Power Smart is demand-side management. Once a typical programme is up and running, most of the money is returned to customers in the form of rebates, customer help lines and other types of service, says Tom Cave, Power Smart's director of energy services. Short-term financial incentives are used to overcome customers' resistance to the higher initial cost of energy-efficient equipment, but the benefits - to the customer and the utility - last much longer. And a crucial component of the programme is marketing. 'To get past the engineering barriers, you have to get people to think about conserving energy. The most powerful energy-saving technique of all is changing people's attitudes, and changing attitudes is essentially a marketing function,' says Cave. Under the umbrella of demand-side management, different utilities have widely varying goals. Utilities in developed countries usually want to discourage consumption across the board - for industrial, commercial and individual customers. In eastern Europe, on the other hand, the problem is seen as too much consumption by industrial users and not enough by residential consumers. Governments there want citizens to have refrigerators and other items which improve the quality of life, says Eric Cardey, a vice-president at Power Smart. Another important driving force behind conservation in eastern Europe is to preserve the environment. Much of the region's electricity is generated from low-grade coal, which contains up to 3.5 per cent sulphur and creates considerable pollution. Unfortunately, conservation cannot be the region's only concern. Large generating complexes were built under the communists to serve industry. Industrial demand, particularly for military production, has fallen off  - but they have to keep selling the electricity to cover the cost of running the power plants they already have. Yet governments in eastern Europe are taking a longer term view about residential consumption. 'If they don't get energy efficient now, because there is so much retrofitting and new construction taking place, they're going to miss the boat,' says Cardey. And the Czechs and Slovaks have realised the importance of marketing in achieving these goals. When they joined Power Smart, they obtained the right to use the name and logo in their advertising and access to programmes for everything from low-energy water heating and lighting to efficient air compressors and even buildings. As an indication of the sort of success they can hope for, Cardey cites the promotion of the use of energy-efficient motors in British Columbia. The motors have a higher cost, which pays for itself in 1.5 to two years through energy savings. The average market share for high-efficiency motors for manufacturing use in North America is 3 per cent. In British Columbia, that share has been increased to 75 per cent since the Power Smart programme began. Arthur Geikie, president of Power Smart, says the strength of his company's programme is that it offers a complete range of conservation plans - for residential, industrial, commercial and institutional users. Being a member of Power Smart allows small utilities to take advantage of research they could not afford, he adds. For an annual fee ranging from CDollars 10,000 for a utility with fewer than 10,000 customers to CDollars 75,000 for a million or more customers, Power Smart provides the right to use its logo in promotional materials. The utilities can also pick from a 'library' of tested and proven ideas and, perhaps just as importantly, avoid costly mistakes. Given the importance of marketing in encouraging conservation, the Power Smart brand name is seen as a key element, providing a shorthand for manufacturers and consumers to rally around. Even in non-English speaking countries such as the Czech and Slovak republics, the English language logo is used alongside a translation. The company endorses products, allowing manufacturers to use the Power Smart logo on qualifying items and making it easy for consumers to identify energy-efficient choices. A large number of Canadian suppliers are already involved. And companies such as Philips, the Dutch electrical concern, and Tungsram, the Hungarian subsidiary of General Electric of the US, are looking at certification for some of their products. Power Smart has carried out consulting work in countries, including Costa Rica, Peru, Thailand and Russia, which have little or no history of demand-side management and which it is hoped will sign up as members in the future. Utilities in developed countries have tended to be a harder market. They usually already have some kind of demand-side management in place, and it is more difficult to convince them of the benefits of banding together. Western Europe has less need for help, largely because electricity prices have been very high for a long time. 'Europeans seem to have positive attitudes already,' says Cardey. For the future, Power Smart hopes to continue expanding. It has signed up its first gas utility and hopes to add more. In the long run, Power Smart expects regions where a number of utilities have signed up, and achieved 'critical mass', to become more autonomous, sharing resources within the region with counterparts which have similar concerns. If BC Hydro, with some of the cheapest electricity in the world, can justify spending money to reduce consumption, anyone can, says Cardey.</p>

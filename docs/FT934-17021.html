			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Arts: Artists open their doors - Lynn MacRitchie finds SPACE full of community spirit FROM THE East End to Vauxhall, more than 200 painters, sculptors, photographers, printmakers, installation and film and video artists will be 'at home' to the public during the first three weekends in October, giving an opportunity to glimpse their working environment as well as to admire - or to buy - their finished products. The occasion is the 25th birthday of SPACE, the remarkable organisation founded by artists in 1968 and still going very strong today, finding, renovating and renting out cheap studio accommodation. Studio visits and tours are complemented by events and exhibitions throughout the month. This weekend, things kick off with the opening of the studios at Lea Bridge Road, Eastway Baths, and Britannia Works. Events include jazz and performance arts at Lea Bridge accompanying an auction of sculpture, painting, prints and works on paper, the proceeds from which will go to the Robert Grace Trust, a charity which provides practical support for people with Aids and their carers. Artists from the studios at Dace Road have donated a portfolio of prints for the auction. At Eastway Baths, an outdoor sculpture exhibition has been mounted including site-specific installations, wall pieces and free standing work. Another, limited edition print portfolio has been produced by the artists from Britannia Works, which will be exhibited and on sale at The Gallery at John Jones. All proceeds from sales of the portfolio, a limited edition of 12, will go to fund educational workshops organised by the artists for local community groups. This commitment by SPACE artists to working with the communities in which their studios are located has always been an important aspect of the organisation. The acronym stands for Space Provision, Artistic, Cultural, and Educational, and one of its aims is to offer cultural and educational activities run by artist members or making use of its accommodation. The artists are thus recognised not as freeloaders, dropping in to a poor or run down area to get what they can out of it, but as a stable part of the community, offering an open door to a creative and supportive environment. The artists who founded SPACE Studios (and its associated organisation AIR, the Art Information Registry) in the late 1960s were a wide ranging group which including Bridget Riley and Peter Sedgley. SPACE and AIR merged into the charity Art Services Grants Ltd (ASG) in about 1973 and it is under these auspices that SPACE continues its work today, with funding from the London Arts Board. SPACE and AIR were not the only artists organisations set up in the late 1960s and early '70s but SPACE is one of the few to have survived with its aims and methods almost intact. The notion of democracy in the arts was very much part of the mood of those times. The artists associated with AIR and SPACE and other organisations such as the Artists Union, the Artists Placement Group and various women artists groups actively tried to intervene in the Arts Council's awards procedures, for example, or protested at the methods of selection of prestigious exhibitions. Much of the artwork of those times was similarly questioning of the status quo, breaking down barriers and exploring new materials and ways of making art and of making art accessible. Artists once again face hard times. Galleries are closing, funding has been slashed and patrons are both few and cautious of new work. Once again the empty buildings of the city hold out a promise - but this time it is developers and landlords who are asking the artists in, to fill the empty spaces nobody wants to rent. In response, SPACE has become professionalised. Running a charity now, in the words of its director, Eva Woloshyn, is like running a business, a business which must be as dynamic and efficient as possible. Although SPACE had difficulties during the property boom of the 1980s, it managed to hang on to its property portfolio. During the recession, its charitable status has proved a source of strength. A prospective tenant who is entitled to a mandatory 80 per cent rebate on the standard business rate is a welcome sight to landlords whose more conventional tenants have been driven out of business by rate increases, leaving behind empty properties. Offers of buildings are carefully considered, with the amount of work required to convert them now seen not as a labour of love but as a cost which must be recouped over time. SPACE's days of taking on anything, working for nothing and moving on are over. The old commitment to bringing artists into closer contact with the community remains, however. Eva Woloshyn believes that, in the properties it leases from the public sector, SPACE can take buildings which have been lost to the public through local authority spending cuts back into community use, as has been done at the Eastway Baths in Hackney, for example. The open studio weekends are a vital part of this process, as well as a great deal of fun. Space Open Studios October 2-3, 9-10, 16-17. Assisted by The Monument Trust.

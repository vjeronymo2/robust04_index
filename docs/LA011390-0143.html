			<p><P> January 13, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PHOTOGRAPHY: SHOOTING FOOTBALL: THE STRATEGY  </P> <P> The football game has reached a critical juncture. The Rams are driving for  what could be the winning field goal, and it's the photographer's job to  outguess quarterback Jim Everett.  </P> <P> All of us from the media who are photographing the event try to predict where  the game action will occur and the best spot to capture the resultant  jubilation. But, suddenly, Everett throws to Willie Anderson for the winning  touchdown, and the Rams are in the National Football Conference championship  game.  </P> <P> These are moments that make football a great game to photograph. They offer  action and a chance to zero in on the sideline emotions.  </P> <P> But being on target isn't the only consideration for great football  photographs. We must also be in focus.  </P> <P> Then there are the factors we have no control over such as an official or  player getting in our way or a player running from the bright sun into the  shadows.  </P> <P> Preparation is the key in photographing football. We need the right clothing,  equipment, stadium darkroom and credentials.  </P> <P> In photographing the Rams in action, our first call is to the public relations  department.  </P> <P> Some people think there is some mythical all-serving press pass that gets us  into a game. If we thought that, we'd be watching the game from the parking  lot. Football teams issue separate credentials for each game.  </P> <P> If the team is on the road, the next step is making the proper travel  arrangements. For the Rams' recent game against the New York Giants, we  contacted the Associated Press in New York and arranged to share their stadium  darkroom.  </P> <P> We also needed to make arrangements to have color negative film processed, two  phone lines and a table for a transmitter.  </P> <P> Flight plans included flying in on Saturday and out on Monday for the Sunday  game. Although the game usually ends around 4 p.m., the processing and  transmitting of photographs can keep us at the stadium until 10 p.m.  </P> <P> Game day for photographers starts very early. There is usually a breakfast  meeting to discuss the various shooting locations and game strategy.  </P> <P> Film will be picked up by wire service runners at the end of each quarter and  taken to the Associated Press darkroom.  </P> <P> One of the staff photographers will leave the game at halftime and edit the  film and start transmitting, which usually leaves just two photographers to  shoot the second half.  </P> <P> Photographers arrive at the game about two hours before kickoff to set up and  locate the wire service darkroom.  </P> <P> Photographers from USA Today, the Washington Times, the Orange County Register  and Los Angeles Daily News use this facility too.  </P> <P> There is usually a check to see that the Leafax transmitter is working. This  machine transmits from a negative, either color or black-and-white, into a  positive form over the phone lines.  </P> <P> It's one of the biggest changes in wire-photo technology in recent years.  </P> <P> Gone are the days of making prints. We simply put the negative in the machine  and the image pops up on a small television screen. Then we crop the  photograph, write a caption, change the contrast and send it.  </P> <P> Each image takes eight minutes to send in black and white or about 30 minutes  in color because three color separations are sent of the image.  </P> <P> The film used during the game is Kodak Ektapress 400 in the first half and 1600  in the second half. The shadows on the field during the first half make it  difficult to shoot. The faster 1600 ISO (ASA) film is needed in the second half  because the entire field is in the shadows.  </P> <P> The weather is another factor beyond our control.  </P> <P> In the Rams' last playoff game against the Giants, the temperature was in the  low 40s, which is pleasant for football if you're dressed properly.  </P> <P> But when we pack for a trip, we have to be prepared for any situation or change  in the weather.  </P> <P> It's wise to have two pairs of gloves, one that is thin or a liner style that  will keep hands warm but allow us to unload the camera and change the film. An  additional heavier pair is needed to go over lighter gloves if it gets really  cold. There are also gloves with the fingers cut out so we can keep them on and  still handle the film.  </P> <P> A warm waterproof jacket and pants are essential, otherwise if the field is a  little damp and we kneel, the freezing water will soak right through.  </P> <P> Warm socks and high-quality boots are also important. They are our first  protection from an ice-cold field and weather that will get colder as the game  progresses. The sun will be gone, leaving the field completely in shadow.  Although this makes it easier to shoot because the field and players are evenly  lit, the cold is uncomfortable.  </P> <P> Rain can be a major problem. Not only do we struggle to keep warm, but we have  to keep our camera gear dry. Today's camera depends so much on electronic  circuitry it doesn't fare well when wet.  </P> <P> We can affix an umbrella to our monopods with clamps and tape plastic bags to  the lenses. This is awkward, but we don't have many options.  </P> <P> One of the nice aspects about inclement weather and football is the look it  gives the images. Muddy exhausted football players slugging it out or battling  through a thick blanket of white snow are good pictures.  </P> <P> The two words you fear most are windchill factor. Then it's best to stay  inside.  </P> <P> The Photography column, which runs Saturdays in Orange County Life, is intended  to help both the serious amateur and weekend shooter.  </P></p>

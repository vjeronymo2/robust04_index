			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Enlarged Transfer Technology shows 63% advance to Pounds 3.46m TRANSFER Technology Group, the successor company to Central &amp; Sheerwood, in which the late Mr Robert Maxwell was the largest shareholder, lifted profits for the first half of 1992 by 63 per cent to Pounds 3.46m. The rise, however, was deceptive as the group's shape changed radically between the 1991 first half and the latest reporting period. In May 1991 a restructuring, which angered shareholders, saw the group buy two Maxwell companies, engineer its reverse into Mr Geoffrey Robinson's Transfer Technology and cease its property activities. Mr Robinson, the Labour MP for Coventry NW, took over the chair from Mr Maxwell. Five months later the Maxwell shareholding was sold. The enlarged group, now a mini-conglomerate of specialist engineering companies, achieved its pre-tax outcome on turnover of Pounds 48.9m, some 64 per cent ahead of that of the former, smaller group. Last May the group launched a Pounds 23.9m rights issue to fund three acquisitions. Holders of the new shares are entitled to the maintained interim dividend of 6.25p, but the new shares have not been used in the calculation of the earnings figure of 22.1p (19.5p) per share. However, Mr Robinson, expecting 'further improvement in our performance' during the current year, said that 'the dividend for 1992 will be an increase over that for 1991.' The 1991 final was 6.75p, bringing the total for that year to 13p. The group is protected from the domestic recession to the extent that over 75 per cent of its business is outside the UK. The rights issue eliminated all gearing and the group now has Pounds 5m on deposit.</p>

			<p><P> May 5, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> A spokeswoman for ABC says the network is "disappointed and dismayed" that  members of the National Assn. of Broadcast Employees and Technicians have  "overwhelmingly" rejected what ABC says is its final contract offer. Twelve of  18 NABET units turned it down. Among the units voting to accept it were NABET  news-writers, hair stylists and transcriptionists at ABC facilities here. ABC  wants to meet with union officials "as soon as possible to make sure the  leadership and its members understand that the terms of our final offer will  not be renegotiated." NABET's contract expired March 31, but has been extended  on a day-to-day basis. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

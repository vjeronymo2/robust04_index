			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Lamont rejects call for royal tax MR Norman Lamont, the Chancellor, last night ruled out taxing the royal family. In a written reply to Labour's Mr Jim Cunningham (Coventry SE), Mr Lamont said he had 'no plans' to extend income tax to members of royalty at present excluded from paying. Labour condemned Mr Lamont's response. Mr Dennis Canavan (Falkirk W) said: 'It is a deplorable answer, particularly bearing in mind the fact that the Queen is one of the richest people in the world.' Mr Andrew MacKinlay, Labour MP for Thurrock, said: 'This will make a lot of people angry. It is demonstrably unfair. The Queen ought to pay tax and so should other members of her family.' Mr Alan Williams, Labour MP for Swansea West, said: 'The Queen is a billionaire. Her income from investments is a closely guarded secret. Why should she pay no tax when her subjects on minuscule incomes are paying tax?'</p>

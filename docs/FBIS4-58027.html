			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Brothers" page] </F>   [Text] Sudan's security forces have arrested Major General  Muhammad Ahmad prior to his departure from Khartoum to assume  the post as his country's ambassador to Kenya.    The "Brothers" sources in Khartoum have confirmed that  before  his departure the major general had invited some of his military  colleagues to a dinner at his house. Heading the list of guests  was Lieutenant General 'Umar al-Bashir. The sources said that  the dinner invitation turned into an open dialogue between  al-Bashir and the army officers, during which the latter  severely criticized al-Bashir for neglecting the Army and  thereby enabling the Islamic Front's cadres to seize power. The  sources note that al-Bashir did not voice any objection to the  officers' talk during dinner.    They said that al-Bashir left the dinner party and went  directly to the house of the Front's interior minister,  'Abd-al-Rahim Husayn, and told him there was a major coup plot  under way by active and retired army officers led by Major  General Ahmad, known as "Al-Sirr Ab Ahmad." He also told the  interior minister that he personally had uncovered this plot  while meeting with the officers. The sources added that the  interior minister ordered the arrest of the major general and  his officer colleagues. Their whereabouts remain unknown.</p>

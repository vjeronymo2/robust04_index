Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> NORWAY OKS $1 BILLION FOR GAMES  </P> <P> The Norwegian Parliament approved plans costing an estimated $1.1 billion today  for the construction of facilities for the 1994 Olympic Winter Games.  </P> <P> The amount planned for building Olympic facilities equals the amount Norway  allocated this year for foreign aid to Third World countries. When Norway  applied two years ago for the games, it estimated the cost at $312.5 million.  </P> <P> A solid majority of three non-socialist government parties and the opposition  Labor Party approved sites for arenas at Lillehammer and other locations around  Lake Mjoesa. The games are intended to be compact, with the Feb. 12-27, 1994,  events taking place as close to one another as possible.  </P></p>

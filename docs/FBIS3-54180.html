The chairman of the committee, Nawabzada  Nasrullah Khan, presided over the meeting which was attended by  Ms. Benazir Bhutto. The committee discussed and approved the  action plan for the observance of the country-wide strike.    Referring to the secretary-level talks between Pakistan and  India, the prime minister said from Pakistan's point of view,  the talks have been a major success because India for the first  time agreed to discuss the Kashmir issue as a separate agenda  item of Pakistan-India parleys. By agreeing to our demand,  India has also accepted the fact that the Kashmiri people are  party to the issue which needed to be solved in accordance with  their wishes. The prime minister said the talks failed to make  any headway due to Indian intransigence. We had asked India to  take several steps to reduce repression. India failed to do so,  leaving no option for Pakistan but to go to the human rights  commission in Geneva with a view to mobilizing international  community to pressurize India to improve the human rights  situation in Kashmir.    Ms. Benazir Bhutto regretted the dualism of the United  Nations in implementation of its resolutions. She said Pakistan  had supported UN resolutions on the Gulf war and Somalia to  strengthen the United Nations' role. The prime minister said  the issue of Kashmir continues to be on the United Nations'  agenda. There should be one law for all, she said and  emphasized that if the UN resolutions could be applicable  elsewhere in the world, they should also be applied in the case  of the Kashmiri people.    Speaking on the occasion, the chairman of the Special  Committee of the National Assembly on Kashmir, Nawabzada  Nasrullah Khan, said participation of the prime minister in the  meeting reflects the importance the government attaches to the  cause of Kashmir.</p>

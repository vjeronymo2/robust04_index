			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / Russia, India face US action over missile deal RUSSIA and India faced the possibility of sanctions by the US after they decided yesterday to go ahead with a Dollars 250m (Pounds 141m) contract for the sale of Russian rocket technology for India's space programme. The Russian decision was announced yesterday by Mr Gennady Burbulis, Russian secretary of state, after three days of bilateral talks. Mr Burbulis ridiculed US attempts to assume the role of global lawmaker on missile technology and said Russia would go ahead with its contract with India. The Bush administration warned both countries they risk US sanctions if the deal goes through. Ms Margaret Tutwiler, state department spokeswoman, said the US would decide soon on its response to the rocket deal, which she said was inconsistent with guidelines of the Missile Technology Control Regime, an accord among western states to limit the spread of missile technology. Russia did not sign the pact, but has agreed to abide by its provisions. Penalties could involve suspension of access to US government contracts and to US technology requiring export licences. A Russian foreign ministry spokesman yesterday called for international experts to examine the deal to show that it should not incur sanctions. 'We insist on an international expert examination of the contract to prove that it doesn't undermine the Missile Technology Control Regime in any way,' Mr Sergei Yastrzhembsky told reporters. Under the deal, the Russian space agency is to sell India technology needed to build rocket booster engines for launching communications satellites. The US apparently feels the Indian space programme has military objectives but Russia has rejected this view. Russia has been collaborating with India on its space programme for a long time. With the help of the then Soviet Union, India has launched several satellites. Russia has now openly resisted US pressure to revise the accord. Mr Burbulis's visit was the first by a Russian leader since the political changes in that country. It has laid the basis for a visit to India by Mr Boris Yeltsin later this year. India has very close ties with the former Soviet Union and faced the possibility of losing an important ally because Indian officials misjudged events that led to the break-up of the Union. They have been busy ever since trying to restore Indo-Russian relations to their former level. Mr Burbulis's remarks at the end of his visit are reassuring to India's ears. As well as defying the US over rocket technology, Mr Burbulis said Russia would continue to supply defence equipment spares. Mr Burbulis said Russia has confirmed its intention to continue defence co-operation that the former Soviet Union had with India. He also said that disruption of Russian crude oil supplies would end soon. During his visit, Mr Burbulis signed a five-year trade agreement with India which envisages payments in hard currency instead of rupees. He also offered India a Rbs2.5bn (Pounds 14.3m) credit for supply of defence equipment and paper.</p>

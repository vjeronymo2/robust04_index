			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Court Cavendish prepares for market debut COURT CAVENDISH, the UK nursing home operator, will today announce plans for a flotation by way of a public offer and placing, likely to value the company at between Pounds 40m and Pounds 50m. Dr Chai Patel, Court Cavendish chairman, said: 'The plan is to de-gear to nothing, but we hope to raise more than the Pounds 24.6m debt we are carrying. If we do not raise any new expansion capital, the market capitalisation would be between Pounds 35m and Pounds 40m.' The company is the fifth largest in its sector in a fragmented market, operating 1,202 beds in 24, mainly purpose built, homes. It plans to grow at 500 beds a year for the next three to five years through acquisitions and joint ventures with health and local authorities as well as increasing beds on existing sites. A pathfinder prospectus for the UBS-arranged flotation, including full accounts for the year to April, is due next month. It is expected that half the shares will be placed with the rest offered to the public. The market for nursing homes, which caters for about 10 per cent of people aged 75 or older, is in flux because of new government funding rules. However, the UK's ageing population means demand in the market should increase. Court Cavendish is joining a growing sector of the stock market including Takare, Quality Care Homes, Associated Nursing Services and the most recent entrant, Westminster Health Care which floated in March. It has a higher proportion than its rivals - 60 per cent - of private or part-private clients. The company began operating in late-1988 and expanded the following year with the Pounds 29m acquisition of 12 homes from Ladbroke, funded by venture capital and the Royal Bank of Scotland. The initial gearing proved 'difficult' and the group was re-financed in 1991. Foster's Brewing Group, which holds 43 per cent in equity converted from Pounds 7.1m mezzanine debt, is expected to sell as is Ladbroke which has an 8 per cent equity stake. Other venture capital backers - Kleinwort Benson, Grosvenor, Gartmore and Legal and General - are expected to remain on board. Management expects to hold between 5 and 10 per cent of the listed company. Results have been affected by high interest charges since 1990. The company estimates making Pounds 54,000 pre-tax profit in the year to April compared with a Pounds 4.36m loss in the previous period. However, it expects profits before interest of Pounds 2.67m after exceptional costs of Pounds 134,000 associated with the flotation (Pounds 1.5m losses, depressed by exceptional costs of Pounds 4.53m). Turnover is estimated at Pounds 13.6m (Pounds 13.3m) giving an operating margin of 20.6 per cent (22.8 per cent), a little lower than rivals. The company said margins were not directly comparable year-on-year because the mix of owned, managed and leased homes fluctuated.</p>

			<p><P> June 2, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CHINA PROTESTERS PUSH BACK TROOPS MARCHING ON SQUARE;  </P> <P> STUDENTS BACKED BY CIVILIANS  </P> <P> Tens of thousands of troops surged to within 200 yards of Tian An Men Square  today in an apparent move against pro-democracy students but were pushed back  by protesters who blocked the road.  </P> <P> The troops, apparently unarmed but carrying backpacks and flashlights, advanced  down Changan Avenue, the capital's main street.  </P> <P> Thousands of students and citizens poured onto the street to stop the soldiers  in front of the Beijing Hotel, several hundred yards east of the square.  Citizens backing the students blockaded the avenue with four trucks.  </P> <P> There was some pushing and shoving between the troops and students, but the  soldiers, mostly young men, did not appear to be armed. At one point, 50  soldiers linked arms and tried to break through but were pushed back.  </P> <P> Tired-looking troops then retreated along the sidewalk six abreast as the crowd  yelled, "The People's Liberation Army loves the people!"  </P> <P> The middle of the square, where students have been camped out for three weeks,  remained calm. The "Ode to Joy" of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony blared over the  student loudspeakers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Many Carried Radios  </P> <P> A convoy of 15 trucks also advanced from the west but was stopped by crowds two  miles from the square, students reported. They said 10 truckloads of troops  entered the Great Hall of the People on the square's west side about midnight.  </P> <P> The soldiers wore boots and white shirts but no jackets with rank insignia were  seen, witnesses said. Many carried radios strapped to their backs.  </P> <P> There was no immediate indication of troops advancing on the square from other  directions. Up to 200,000 troops are reported camped around the city.  </P> <P> Earlier in the day, 1,000 helmeted soldiers had jogged near Tian An Men Square,  the symbolic heart of China, in another government ploy to intimidate the  students.  </P> <P> Those troops ran out of a nearby train station and through the surrounding  neighborhood before they returned to their camp, about a mile from the square.  </P> <P> The protesters have been staging anti-government protests in defiance of  martial law orders to leave.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Copies of Paper Burned  </P> <P> Also today, 500 students burned copies of the official Beijing Daily outside  the paper's building to vent their anger over the increased government  condemnation of the democratic reform movement in communist China.  </P> <P> The students were particularly incensed by an article in Thursday's edition  claiming dissension among different factions directing the movement.  </P> <P> The Beijing Daily, which is controlled by the city Communist Party, is known  for its hard-line views.  </P> <P> This is the third straight day that troops have appeared on city streets,  reinforcing government pronouncements that the army was poised to carry out  Premier Li Peng's order of martial law for Beijing.  </P> <P> The students, who have gained considerable support from ordinary citizens, are  demanding more democracy, an end to corruption among officials, and a dialogue  with the government. Beijing citizens blocked troops from entering the city  after Li declared martial law on May 20.  </P></p>

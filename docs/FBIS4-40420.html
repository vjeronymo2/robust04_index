			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Andrey Bychkov and </F> Andrey Kirillov]    [Text] Moscow, 16 Jun (TASS) -- Talks between Russian Prime  Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and Vo Van Kiet, the Prime Minister  of the SRV Government, were concluded at noon today.  Incidentally, the signing of the treaty on the basis of  friendly relations between the two countries and other  documents, which was expected immediately after the conclusion  of talks, has been postponed until this evening.    Answering an ITAR-TASS correspondent's question, Viktor  Chernomyrdin stated that "in fact, there are no disagreements  between us." Explaining the delay regarding the signing of  Russian- Vietnamese documents, the head of the Russian  Government noted that during a discussion "technicalities"  arose, which require further work on the part of specialists.  Thus, he added, the signing is being postponed until this  evening. "We are convinced," Chernomyrdin stressed, "that we and  Vietnam have all the possibilities and potential to increase  traditional cooperation in the trade-economic, technical,  scientific -- as well as other -- spheres".    For his part, Vo Van Kiet agreed with the assessment of the  talks given by the Russian prime minister and added: "We need  some time to better prepare these documents."    ITAR-TASS correspondents have learned from well-informed  sources close to the Vietnamese delegation that disagreements in  the position of the sides arose on the following issues: the  problem of settling the debt of Vietnam to Russia, which the  latter inherited from the former USSR, the conditions for the  Russian Navy's use of the base of Cam Ranh, and a range of  issues relating to Vietnamese citizens residing in Russia.</p>

Wasmosy denied having earlier expressed an opinion on this  matter. He noted that all he had done so far was to meet with  military representatives at the Armed Forces headquarters and  with members of the Congressional Standing Committee to hear  their views on this matter.    Wasmosy, who made these remarks last night upon his arrival  in the country after visiting Ecuador and Peru, also announced  that the Paraguayan Government will convey its decision to the  United States through the Foreign Ministry.    A controvery over this issue erupted among politicians and  lawmakers during Wasmosy's absence. Several congressmen have  voiced support for the entry into our country of the U.S.  servicemen. Asked whether his answer would be positive or  negative, he said he would answer this question as soon as "I  arrive and have time to stop and think about it."</p>

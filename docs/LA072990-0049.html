			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP EYE  </P> <P> FREE SPEECH I: Virgin Records' Jeff Ayeroff, one of the few record execs brave  enough to take a stand against censorship and record labeling, has already made  news by saying he'll put pro-First Amendment stickers on new Virgin discs  starting next week. But now Virgin is battling censorship with the best weapon  possible -- satire. Friday, the label will release "(If U Want Free Speech) Go  to Russia," a mock-rap single by political spoofster Harry Shearer that  features a biting attack on anti-rock crusaders.  </P> <P> (The single will have cover art designed by "Simpsons" creator Matt Groening.)  It goes in part:  </P> <P>  This is the Sheriff of Yahoo County talkin',  </P> <P>  If you're sellin' smutty rap, you better start walkin',  </P> <P>  No use suin', no use squawkin', the judge sez I can come in and hush ya,  </P> <P>  If U want free speech, go to Russia. . . .  </P> <P>  From museums to movies to record stores, we're drying up America's sores,  </P> <P>  A mind is a terrible thing to have without doors,  </P> <P>  So don't make me come in and cuff and cuss ya,  </P> <P>  If U want free speech, go to Russia.  </P></p>

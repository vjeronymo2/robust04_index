			<p><P> May 21, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA JOB MARKET;  </P> <P> THE WORKPLACE;  </P> <P> WHAT YOU GET;  </P> <P> HERE'S A GUIDE TO THE STATE'S WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM  </P> <P> Each year, thousands of Californians injured on the job learn that, except  under the rarest of circumstances, they cannot sue their employers, even if  they believe that their injuries are their employers' fault.  </P> <P> Injured employees are entitled only to benefits under a no-fault system called  workers compensation. This system began 75 years ago when employees traded  their right to sue -- and perhaps lose -- for modest, but sure benefits. These  include free medical care, now up to $224 a week in lost wages, and small sums  to compensate for permanent physical losses: $840, for instance, for the loss  of a finger; $13,000 for the loss of an eye. Since 1975, injured workers unable  to return to their old jobs have also been entitled to free retraining.  </P> <P> Here are some answers to some commonly asked questions about the system.  </P> <P> Question: Who is entitled to workers' compensation?  </P> <P> Answer: Virtually every worker whose injury "arises out of and in the course of  employment," regardless of whose fault the injury was. A worker is entitled to  benefits even if he had his affliction to begin with and work just made it  worse.  </P> <P> Q: What should a worker do if he's injured on the job?  </P> <P> A: Report his injury to his employer, who is required to notify state  government and the employer's workers compensation insurance carrier.  </P> <P> Q: Can an injured worker go to his own doctor for the free treatment?  </P> <P> A: Only if he told his employer before his injury that he wants to visit his  own doctor, clinic or health maintenance organization. Otherwise, to obtain  free medical care, the injured worker must visit the doctor of his employer's  choice for the first month of treatment. After that, the worker can pick his  own doctor for treatment, but must submit to examinations by the employer's  physicians if they wish to evaluate his case.  </P> <P> Q: What should an injured worker do if he suspects his injury is work-related,  but is not sure -- if, for example, he is having symptoms such as aches and  pains?  </P> <P> A: See a doctor. If he thinks your injury is work-related, he is legally  obligated to inform state government. Then tell your boss.  </P> <P> Q: What if your boss and his insurance company dispute your doctor's  assessment?  </P> <P> This is often the case with so-called cumulative injuries -- less obvious  injuries that creep up over a long period. You spend years digging ditches, for  example, and your back finally wears out. If the company disputes the  work-related nature of your back injury, then, to obtain workers comp benefits,  you have to file a claim with the Workers Compensation Appeals Board.  Ultimately, it will be up to a judge to decide if your injury is work-related.  Meanwhile, if your back hurts too much to work, you can obtain state temporary  disability benefits -- a maximum of $224 a week, the same as workers  compensation benefits.  </P> <P> Q: Are there places you can go for advice on how to pursue a disputed claim?  </P> <P> A: Kenneth Draft, acting chief of the information and assistance bureau of the  state division of industrial accidents, suggests calling one of his 20  information and assistance officers spread around California. "We'll tell you  what we think of your case," Draft said. Union officials are usually acquainted  with the system. Plus there are lawyers who specialize in workers compensation  cases. You can find them in the Yellow Pages.  </P> <P> Q: When do I need a lawyer?  </P> <P> A: You can file a case before the workers compensation appeals board yourself.  But, said Melvin S. Witt, editor and publisher of California Workers'  Compensation Reporter, which keeps track of developments in workers  compensation law, "the only sound counsel as far as I'm concerned is that if  you have any kind of injury that's serious, you should have an attorney." Witt,  a former insurance company lawyer and chairman of the appeals board, said that  even well-meaning insurance company claims adjusters are so overworked that  "cases just sit their on their desks" and injured workers "get the runaround."  Having a lawyer sometimes helps.  </P> <P> Q: How much does a lawyer cost?  </P> <P> A: Lawyers take these cases on a contingency basis and judges award them from  9% to 15% of an injured worker's permanent disability award.  </P> <P> Q: How do these cases end?  </P> <P> A: At some point, an injured worker's condition stabilizes. It becomes, in  workers compensation parlance, "permanent and stationary." The doctor says go  back to work or, if the employee remains unfit to resume his former job, begin  retraining, said Michael Gerson, who represents injured workers and is  president-elect of the California Applicants Attorneys Assn. The extent of the  worker's permanent disability is assessed as a percentage of disability --  reflecting his diminished ability to compete in the open labor market. He  either settles his case with the insurance company or pursues a permanent  disability award from a workers compensation judge. These awards are usually  payable in increments of $140 a week.  </P> <P> Q: How would a workers compensation plan under consideration by the Legislature  change things?  </P> <P> A: All but the lowest-paid workers would get more benefits. The lowest paid  workers would get less. Temporary disability payments would rise to a maximum  of $511 by 1992. Mental stress claims that don't involve physical injury would  be severely limited. Employees would have to pay half of their permanent  disability awards for job retraining. Insurance companies would be penalized if  they didn't pay workers promptly.  </P> <P> Q: What are the rare circumstances in which an injured worker can sue his  employer for damages?  </P> <P> A: If his employer physically attacks him, hides knowledge of a hazard -- such  as a dangerous chemical -- that he knows is giving his workers a disease,  deliberately removes an equipment safety guard, or manufactures the piece of  equipment on which his employee gets hurt.  </P></p>

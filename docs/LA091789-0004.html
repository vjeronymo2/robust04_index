			<p><P> September 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> After recently watching America's most popular television show, "Roseanne," I  sincerely believe that the viewing public wants good old family programming.  What a great half hour! I learned so much to pass on to our younger generation.  Don't Roseanne and her Neanderthal husband set a shining example of how to act  drunk in a bar and minutes later arrive home, as if they did not drive even the  least bit intoxicated? Hey, and that barroom fight. There is nothing like  punching out a vulnerable drunken man, a good lesson for the impressionable  youth of our country. Boy, I can still feel the testosterone racing violently  through my veins at the sound of hand meeting face. Is this how family  programming should make me feel?  </P> <P> Michael S.

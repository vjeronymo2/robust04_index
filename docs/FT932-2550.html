			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Slow wage growth raises job hopes MAY'S SURPRISE fall in unemployment - the fourth in a row - suggests that the UK labour market has stabilised while subdued wage and cost pressures yesterday raised hopes that jobless numbers may fall further. But while Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary, hailed the figures as 'good news' and a 'remarkable achievement', the Department for Employment's statisticians were in no hurry to declare that unemployment is now firmly on the downward path. 'They don't want to have a stab at a trend,' the department said. 'We are a bit cautious. There could still be monthly increases.' Economists and officials are still unsure why seasonally adjusted unemployment has declined from its January peak of 2.99m to the provisional total of 2.91m on May 13. Unemployment has traditionally been regarded as a lagging indicator of economic activity. Yet its downward trend in recent months has coincided with rising industrial production and retail sales. The latest decline suggests that labour markets have become more responsive to economic conditions, due in part to trade union reforms and heightened international competition. If so, Britain is more of a hire and fire society. Some support for this can be found in yesterday's employment statistics. They show that the largest number of hours lost through short-time working in manufacturing industry in the recent recession was 1.08m in December last year. During the previous recession, 8m hours were lost in one month in 1980, indicating that companies hoarded labour more at that time. The figures also go some way to refuting claims that people have been removed wholesale from the unemployment register through such means as registering for invalidity benefit. While the UK workforce in employment fell by 17,000 in the first quarter to 24.92m in March, the number of employees actually rose to 21.37m from 21.35m in December. The overall drop reflected falls in the number of self-employed, the armed forces and those on work-related government training programmes. Also encouraging was a seasonally-adjusted rise in Jobcentre vacancies between April and May. Up only 100 to 123,600, the total was the highest for more than two years. The unemployment figures also fell in all regions last month except for the north, where the total stayed the same. Blackspots remain, however. Greater London's unemployed total fell only 1,600 with the jobless rate staying unchanged at a higher than average 11.6 per cent. Unemployment in the two worst areas - Northern Ireland and the north of England - was 13.9 and 12.1 per cent respectively against a national average of 10.4 per cent. Figures for average earnings, productivity and unit labour costs point to improved UK competitiveness that may result in a further pick up in the labour market. Average earnings rose at an underlying rate of 4 per cent in the year to April, unchanged from March and the lowest rate of increase for 25 years. While average earnings in manufacturing rose by an underlying 5 per cent in April - unchanged from March's figure which was revised up by 0.25 per cent  -earnings growth in the service sector slowed to 3.5 per cent in April from 3.75 per cent in March. Manufacturing output per head rose by 2.5 per cent in the three months to April compared with the previous three months and was 7.8 per cent higher than in the three months ended April last year. As a result unit labour costs in manufacturing fell 2.8 per cent in the three months to April compared with the same 1992 period - the second biggest fall since statistics were first gathered in 1970.  ------------------------------------- UK unemployment: May 1993  -------------------------------------                            Per cent Northern Ireland             13.9 North                        12.1 West Midlands                11.1 North-west                   10.8 Yorks &amp; Humber               10.4 South-east                   10.2 Wales                        10.2 South-west                    9.8 Scotland                      9.6 East Midlands                 9.6 East Anglia                   8.4 UK                           10.4  ------------------------------------- Seasonally adjusted  -------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------- UK inflation rate (+1.3%)     RPI: 141.1 in May  -----------------------------------------------------                              Per cent Housing (172)                  -7.0 Motoring (143)                 +3.8 Food (non-seasonal) (130)      +2.7 Alcoholic drink (80)           +4.7 Household goods (77)           +1.6 Clothing &amp; footwear (59)       +1.1 Household services (48)        +3.8 Leisure goods (47)             +1.7 Catering (47)                  +5.4 Fuel &amp; light (47)              -1.6 Personal goods, serv.

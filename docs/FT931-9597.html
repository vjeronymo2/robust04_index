			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Forte to refinance short-term debt via Pounds 200m debenture issue FORTE, the hotels group, is raising Pounds 200m in the first large debenture issue in the UK for a year and a half. The long-dated secured bonds are being used to extend the maturity of the group's debt, and to take advantage of low long-term interest rates, said Mr Donald Main, finance director. 'Corporates will face increasing competition for funds with the very large (UK) government borrowing requirement.' The money is being used to refinance part of the group's Pounds 940m of short-term facilities, Pounds 350m of which is covered by a multiple option facility which falls due next year. The company has Pounds 620m drawn under these facilities, said Mr Main. The bonds, which carry a coupon of 10 per cent and mature in 2018, are secured on 11 of the group's hotels around the UK, including the Waldorf in London. Only Pounds 20m of the group's other assets have been used to secure borrowing. The bonds were priced yesterday to give investors a yield 1.15 percentage points above the nearest comparable gilt, the 8.75 per cent stock due 2017. At that level they offer less than a similar Pounds 200m issue from Queens Moat Houses, which yields 1.35 points more than the gilt. However, the shortage of new long-dated corporate bonds recently prompted good reported demand for the bonds, which came mainly from UK insurance companies and pension funds looking to match the maturity of their liabilities to long-dated assets. The issue comes less than a week after investors received Pounds 120m from the early repayment of a Pounds 130m debenture from London &amp; Provincial, the first secured issue in recent memory to repay below par. Some of this cash is thought to have been reinvested in the Forte issue, helping to create demand.</p>

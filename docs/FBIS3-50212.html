The president termed his meetings with political leaders as  "a first touch (...) that will have to be furthered. Likewise,  the direct inter-party dialogue should continue. Which is what  I have suggested. And so said also the representatives of the  Democratic Convention of Romania" (the group of opposition  parties.)    "To the extent to which a political pact or at least an  understanding among parties will or will not come to the fore,"  President Iliescu went on, "it seems to me that the next step to  be taken is to extend the dialogue at a parties--trade unions  and government-trade unions level. I have been always ready for  direct talks with the representatives of the big trade union  federations, in order to secure a framework of partnership for  the dialogue among these political forces, trade unions,  government, administration, and employers."    Of the major targets of the envisaged wide-scale dialogue,  Ion Iliescu mentioned the establishment of the contact points  for the establishment of a platform of national interest and the  sketching of a perspective program, of a social-economic  development strategy for Romania with the beginning of the 21st  century in sight. "We have to look ahead, so as to open the  prospect for Romania's integration in the processes  characteristic of the world economic development," President Ion  Iliescu stressed. "Or, here, I think, all forces, political  included, should be interested. And all our valuable people --  and we do have such people -- should be attracted to this work  of national interest."</p>

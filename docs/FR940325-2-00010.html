			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Fair Value Comparisons  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To determine whether sales of CA cement and cement clinker, and CA flux from France were made at less than fair value, we compared United States Price (USP) to the FMV, as specified in the ``United States Price'' and ``Foreign Market Value'' sections of this notice. We made revisions to respondent's reported data, where appropriate, based on verification findings. For those unreported U.S. cement sales which respondent claimed were made pursuant to certain graduated requirements contracts effective prior to the POI, but for which respondent could not provide documentary evidence substantiating its claim, we based our analysis on best information available (BIA), in accordance with 19 CFR 353.37. As BIA, we used the highest, non-aberrational margin calculated for any of respondent's reported U.S. sales of cement. (See Comment 1 in the ``Interested Party Comments'' section of this notice.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> United States Price  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All of Lafarge's U.S. sales to the first unrelated purchaser took place after importation into the United states. Therefore, we based USP on exporter's sales prices (ESP), in accordance with section 772(c) of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For ESP sales of cement, we included in our final analysis certain reported sales allegedly made under an exclusive supply contract, using the reported, verified date of purchase order as the date of sale. (See Comment 2 in the ``Interested Party Comments'' section of this notice.) For ESP sales of flux, we included in our final analysis certain reported sales made under a contract which expired but which respondent claimed had been subsequently renewed prior to the POI, but for which respondent could not provide documentary evidence substantiating that claim. For these sales, we used the verified date of purchase order (or date of invoice where the purchase order date was unavailable) as the date of sale. (See Comment 9 in the ``Interested Party Comments'' section of this notice.) Furthermore, we excluded certain reported flux shipments made in October 1992 pursuant to a contract effective prior to the POI, the price terms of which were modified in November 1992. (See Comment 10 in the ``Interested Party Comments'' section of this notice.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We calculated USP based on packed or bulk, ex-U.S. warehouse or delivered prices to unrelated customers in the United States. For sales of both classes or kinds of merchandise, we made deductions, where appropriate, for foreign inland freight, foreign brokerage and handling, ocean freight, marine insurance, U.S. brokerage and handling (including harbor maintenance and customs processing fees), unloading costs, and U.S. inland freight charges (including loading, freight to processors' warehouses/transfer freight to warehouses, demurrage and freight to customer charges, where applicable). For sales of CA flux, we recalculated foreign inland freight, foreign brokerage and handling, ocean freight and U.S. inland freight expenses to correct minor clerical errors found at verification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For sales of both classes or kinds of merchandise, we also deducted direct selling expenses including credit and product liability premiums. We recalculated credit expenses to account for discounts, where applicable, and to correct minor clerical errors found at verification with respect to the reported weighted-average short-term interest rate and the reported payment or shipment dates for certain transactions. We also recalculated credit for those sales that had missing payment dates. For those missing payment dates, we used, as BIA, the date of the final determination as the date of payment. In addition, we reclassified premiums for product liability insurance as direct selling expenses, and deducted them from USP accordingly. (See Comment 15 in the ``Interested Party Comments'' section of this notice.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For sales of both classes or kinds of merchandise, we also deducted indirect selling expenses (including pre-sale warehousing costs incurred in the United States and selling expenses incurred in France on the merchandise exported to the United States for further manufacturing). U.S. indirect selling expenses were recalculated to exclude certain administrative expenses which were determined to be more appropriately classified as general and administrative (G&amp;A) expenses. (See Comment 18 in the ``Interested Party Comments'' section of this notice.) We also deducted imputed inventory carrying costs for the period between production of the clinker/flux in France and shipment of the finished cement/processed flux to the customer in the United States. For sales of CA cement, we recalculated inventory carrying costs for the period between production of the clinker in France and the start of production of the finished cement in the United States, using the verified weighted-average short-term interest rate in France for the POI. (See Comment 4 in the ``Interested Party Comments'' section of this notice.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For sales of CA cement, we also deducted rebates, discounts and warranty expenses, where applicable. For sales of CA flux, we also deducted commissions, where appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, for both classes or kinds of merchandise, we made deductions, where appropriate, for all value added in the United States pursuant to section 772(e)(3) of the Act. The value added consists of the costs associated with further manufacturing the imported products, including a proportional amount of any profit related to further manufacturing. We calculated profit attributable to further manufacturing in the United States by deducting from the sales price all applicable costs incurred in producing the further manufactured products. We then allocated the total profit proportionally to all components of cost. We deducted only the profit attributable to the value added in the United States. In determining the costs incurred to produce the further manufactured products, we included: (1) The costs of manufacture (COM); (2) movement and packing expenses; (3) selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses; and (4) interest expenses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / UK hotel groups report big falls EMPTY UK hotel rooms caused full-year pre-tax profits at Forte to fall 62 per cent to Pounds 73m while the Savoy Group fell 78 per cent to Pounds 2.3m. Forte, whose interests include restaurants and contract catering as well as hotels, said the Gulf war and the UK and US recessions had combined to make 1991 the worst year in almost a decade for the British hotel business. Forte said: 'The impact on our large portfolio of London hotels was particularly dramatic. There were sharp falls in the number of overseas visitors, particularly from the United States.' It said profits in its provincial hotels had been hit by cutbacks in the corporate market, compounded by a decline in leisure travel in the second half of 1991. Mr Rocco Forte, chief executive, said occupancy in the group's London hotels had fallen 20 per cent in the first half of last year and 5 per cent in the second to give an overall drop for 1991 of 12 per cent. In the provinces, occupancy fell 4 per cent over the year, with a slightly bigger drop in the second half. Mr Forte declined to reveal last year's level of room occupancy. Mr Giles Shepard, managing director of the Savoy Group, in which Forte holds 69 per cent of the shares and 42.5 per cent of the voting shares, said its London hotels had an occupancy rate of 60 per cent last year, compared with more than 70 per cent in 1990. The Lancaster, the Savoy group's Paris hotel, also suffered a sharp drop in occupancy levels, from 78 per cent in 1990 to 63 per cent last year. Mr Forte said he intended to reduce his group's dependence on the UK market by increasing earnings from hotels abroad. Forte currently earns about 80 of its hotel trading profit in the UK. He said the group eventually hoped to gain 50 per cent of hotel trading profits abroad. 'Our principal thrust is on the Continent. We hope to make some moves in the not too distant future. We have some clear targets,' he said. Mr Shepard said international expansion was not an option for the Savoy Group, which owns six hotels, five of which are in the UK.

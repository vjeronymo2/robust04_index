			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Kantor hits back at EU critics Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, yesterday attacked the European Union for its criticism of the Clinton administration's Japan policy and invited it to take part in US-Japan talks. 'Europeans are always delighted when they can hold our coats and we go out to get our noses bloodied,' he told the Economic Strategy Institute. The US was ready to 'trilateralise or multilateralise' its talks with Japan, 'but we don't look for criticism from those who sit on the sidelines and don't get in the game'. He said he could not define the 'managed trade' the EU was accusing the US of adopting. He pointed sarcastically to 'voluntary restraint on cars and trucks at 16 per cent in Europe? That wouldn't be managed trade, would it?' The EU telecommunications procurement and broadcast directives also curbed imports, he said. 'Every time it's in their interest to engage in behaviour which is not opening their markets, that's justified.' On Japan, Mr Kantor said there had been 'interesting movement' in the dispute over cellular telephones. He was awaiting documents from Tokyo, he said, and implied the agreement would have the kind of 'quantitative indicators' the US insisted on in the broader trade framework talks. Japan had failed to honour its promise to stimulate its economy, he claimed. 'They adopted a tax rebate proposal for one year and then tried to figure out how to pay for it. The definition of a stimulus is that you stimulate your economy and you don't pay for it.' On other subjects, he said: The US would ask the new World Trade Organisation, the proposed Gatt successor, to adopt a multilateral version of the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act to prohibit bribery of foreign officials. The US would seek the adoption of fair labour standards. He was hopeful that the declining trend in US semiconductor sales in Japan had been reversed in the fourth quarter of last year, but would move swiftly if it had not. The US-EU audio visual dispute had to be dealt with 'industry-to-industry and then government-to-government'.</p>

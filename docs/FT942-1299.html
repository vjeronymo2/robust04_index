			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / International Bonds: Improvement in sentiment brings a flurry of issuance There was an emerging-market flavour to the eurobond market yesterday as an improvement in sentiment in European government bond markets encouraged a flurry of issuance in a variety of currencies. The Province of Buenos Aires launched its first deal under its medium-term note programme when it raised Dollars 100m through an offering of three-year eurobonds. Lead manager Salomon Brothers said the bonds were mainly bought by emerging market funds in the US through the 144a tranche. A portion of the offering, which was priced to yield 333 basis points over Treasuries, was swapped into yen to appeal to Japanese investors. The other emerging-market borrower of the day was the National Bank of Hungary which made its first appearance in the euro-guilder sector. Lead manager ING Bank said the deal was part of the issuer's strategy of broadening its investor base and accessing more markets. Syndicate managers noted that this was also the first euro-guilder offering by an emerging market borrower for five years. The Fl 150m issue of five-year bonds, which were priced to yield 235 basis points over comparable Dutch government bonds, was bought mainly by domestic institutions attracted by the yield spread. When the bonds were freed to trade, they traded at 98.70, down from the re-offer price at the launch of 98.835. Rabobank also tapped the five-year area of the euro-guilder sector when it raised Fl 500m. Some syndicate managers expressed surprise at the yield spread of 18 basis points over five-year Dutch government bonds which in their view was several basis points wider than Rabobank's usual target. They said the generous pricing reflected the issuer's desire to ensure a favourable response from investors to this relatively large deal. The bonds were targeted mainly at retail investors since institutions were still looking at the longer end of the yield curve. Elsewhere, the D-Mark sector saw some activity as Wuestenrot Finanz, the German mortgage institution, issued DM500m of five-year floating-rate notes. The discounted margin on the notes was 21 basis points over Libor. The deal was arranged by CS First Boston which also raised DM250m for itself through an offering of five-year eurobonds.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Phnom Penh, 14 Mar (PL) -- Cuban Foreign Relations  Minister Roberto Robaina today started an official visit to  Cambodia, the fourth leg of his tour of seven South and  Southeast Asian countries to reinforce ties with that region.    This will be the first high-level contact between Havana and  the government of Phnom Penh which was elected last year under  UN auspices.    The Cuban minister will meet with his Cambodian counterpart,  Norodom Sirivuth, who will welcome him officially at the capital  city airport of Pochentong. Sirivuth is the younger brother of  King Norodom Sihanouk.    Sirivuth will attend to the visiting delegation in his  capacity as acting head of government in the absence of Prime  Ministers Norodom Ranarith and Hun Sen, who are abroad.    Robaina will also be greeted during a special audience with  Chea Sim, the acting head of state and president of the National  Assembly, who has for the past months represented Sihanouk, who  is receiving medical treatment in China.    Before heading for Phnom Penh, the head of Cuban diplomacy  visited Indonesia, where he started his tour, Laos, and Myanmar  [Burma], and he made a stopover in Thailand's capital, Bangkok.    His next destinations are India, Malaysia, and Vietnam.    Robaina told PRENSA LATINA that Cuba has found new  possibilities for exchanges and communication with the countries  that he visited. He added that the hosts voiced their interest  and desire to negotiate with Havana in the areas of health,  biotechnology, and sports, among others.    In his opinion, Cuba must study the economic explosion  experienced by this region and determine what is most applicable  to its own situation.    The most important aspect of this tour, Robaina pointed out,  is the degree of understanding and the opportunities we have  found to explain the true reality of the Cuban project.</p>

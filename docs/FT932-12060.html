			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / 'Bridge built' between Taiwan and China CHINA and Taiwan, bitter enemies for more than 40 years, yesterday signed agreements in Singapore which could mark the first tentative steps towards the resolution of one of the world's more intractable conflicts. The agreements themselves were limited in nature. The talks were described as unofficial and were not supposed to involve any discussion of political matters. But, as the two delegations posed for the world's media, clinked champagne glasses and repeatedly shook hands, it was hard to escape the feeling that something important had been set in train. The delegates seemed to agree. Mr Koo Chen Fu, a multi-millionaire businessman and leader of Taiwan's delegation, said the meeting had been historic. Mr Wang Daohan, a former mayor of Shanghai and leader of the China side, said the discussions had been momentous. 'We have built a bridge between us,' said Mr Koo. 'No one can say we have not achieved results . . . both sides have won.' The agreements covered mostly technical matters. These included joint efforts to combat crime, the resolution of fishing disputes, judicial co-operation and cultural and scientific exchanges. Most importantly a formal structure for future exchanges between the two sides was also established. With the opening up of China's economy and growing business and social ties between Taiwan and the mainland such lines of communication are urgently needed. Both sides also talked of the deep differences between them. Taiwan businesses now have an estimated Dollars 9bn (Pounds 5.8bn) of investments in China. Taiwan had come to the Singapore meeting wanting assurances from China that it would develop a legal framework for the protection of these investments. The Chinese side refused, saying existing laws were adequate. Disagreements on this issue, still unresolved, forced the meeting into a third unscheduled day. Taiwan also became angry when China raised the question of direct shipping and air links. All contact between China and Taiwan, politically separated since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, is indirect. The word reunification was hardly mentioned. One delegate said that Taiwan and China had developed different systems and different ways of life. It's not like in Europe,' he said. 'Don't think there is going to be unity overnight. If it ever happens it will take years.' But at least now the two sides are not, as they were not so long ago, lobbing artillery shells at each other.</p>

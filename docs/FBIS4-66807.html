			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [First paragraph is THE STATESMAN introduction] </F>   [Text] New Delhi, April 10--In his first rally after being  appointed the Sarsanghchalak, Singh laid the blame squarely on  the Government for the demolition of the Babri Masjid at Ayodhya.    The chief of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh [RSS], Mr  Rajendra Singh, today justified the demolition of the Babri  Masjid at Ayodhya and exhorted the Muslim leaders of the country  to hand over the religious sites in Mathura and Varanasi "since  it is not of the same importance for the Muslims as it is for  the Hindus."    He added that such an action would go a long way in  restoring  confidence of the Muslim community in the minds of the Hindus.  He then went on to say, "We are all sons of the same soil and  equal in all respects before the eyes of the law."    Mr Singh was addressing his first RSS rally after being  appointed the Sarsanghchalak. He laid the blame squarely on the  Government for the demolition of the Babri Masjid since, he  said, it had failed to find a solution to the problem. "No one  else but the Government is responsible," he told the estimated  25,000 RSS volunteers, who had gathered at the Ramlia grounds on  the occasion of the Varsha Pratiprada Utsav, the Hindu New Year  Day.    In his hour-long address, Mr Singh touched on a wide range  of  issues.    On GATT: He charged the Government with what he  called sacrificing the interests of the nation by deciding to  sign the draft of the General Agreements on Tariff and Trade in  Marrakesh on April 15.    He said he wondered why the Government was keen on signing  the treaty when India's share in the volume of international  trade was a meagre 0.5 percent. On the contrary, it would be  more advisable to sign bilateral treaties with trading nations,  he said, since that would, by itself, raise the share of the  country in world trade.    He said that the Government was going ahead with its  decision  to sign the treaty when the external debt of the country was a  staggering Rs 240,000 [rupees] crores as compared to Rs 17,000  crores in 1980.    On Kashmir: Criticizing the recent moves by the  Government to initiate the democratic process in Jammu and  Kashmir, Mr Singh said that the Centre's efforts would be futile  since the militants continued to hold sway in the Valley.    On the N-issue: Regarding the question whether  India should go nuclear, Mr Singh said that possessing nuclear  weapons did not mean that India would launch a nuclear attack on  any country.    On politics: Without naming the Congress(I), he  charged it with breaking up the Telugu Desam Party and the  Janata Dal(A) to ensure that it secured a majority on the floor  of the House. Speaking about corruption, he said that the  Government was, itself, not setting a good example for the  people to follow. "Otherwise, how could a minority Government  attain a majority?" he said.    Also present at the rally, were Ministers in the Delhi  Government, Mr Sahib Singh Verma, Mr Lal Behari Tiwari, Mr  Jagdish Mukhi, and leaders of the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party],  Mr Vijay Kumar Malhotra and Mr Kedar Nath Sahni.</p>

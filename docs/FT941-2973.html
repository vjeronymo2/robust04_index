			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Hurd drums up support over Euro-veto row Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, last night addressed senior members of the powerful backbench 1922 Committee to rally support for an eventual compromise over Britain's demand that there should be no change to its blocking veto. The foreign secretary earlier received the cabinet's backing for a deal which 'preserved the substance' of the UK position, which seeks to prevent the number of votes needed to block legislation rising from 23 to 27. But he was warned by Euro-sceptics that they would not vote for any deal which 'further diluted the Common's authority'. Both Mr Hurd and the prime minister, however, have made it clear that the dispute should not lead to a delay in enlargement of the community. At prime minister's questions Mr John Major rebuked Mr Roger Knapman, a Conservative Euro-sceptic, for trying to get the government to rule out any compromise. 'I have no intention of being moved by synthetic efforts to pressure us from any source,' he said. He insisted that Mr Hurd was negotiating to safeguard Britain's short and long-term interests, and added: 'I am entirely confident that can be done in an acceptable way without any question of delaying enlargement.' Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said Mr Hurd had the full support of his cabinet colleagues for negotiations with EU foreign ministers on Tuesday. He told a press conference on deregulation that he had always described himself as a European because Britain's membership of the EU was 'a policy extension of Britain's self-interest'. It did the UK no harm if there were rows with Britain's partners, he said. The government plans to bring forward legislation to the Commons in the autumn if there is agreement on enlargement. But a number of Conservative rightwingers and Euro-sceptics are threatening to rebel if the government compromises over weakening its blocking veto. Some unsuccessfully demanded that any deal by Mr Hurd should first be discussed in the Commons. Top business executives with experience of multinational companies should be appointed to a special task force to tackle large-scale fraud in the European Union, a House of Lords committee recommends today, Ivor Owen writes. Lord Hunt of Tamworth, chairman of the Lords committee on the European communities, refers to a report by the Court of Auditors on the 1992 EU budget which showed Ecu162m had been misapplied or not received. He says a similar condemnation of international industrial or trading groups in the UK would result in shareholders sacking the directors and appointing a new board. The committee calls for the task force to be established as part of urgent remedial action co-ordinated by the council of ministers, the European Commission and member states.</p>

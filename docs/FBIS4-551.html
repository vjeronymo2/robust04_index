			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with James Ruego, RPF representative in Brussels, </F> by correspondent Linda Dewin in Brussels -- recorded, in French  with superimposed translation into Dutch]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Dewin] What are the intentions  of the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF]? A coup d'etat?    [Ruego] Our primary goal is to restore order, to restablish  the constitutional state, security for everyone. After that we  will adhere to the principles of the Arusha Accords. We do not  wish to seize power just for its own sake.    [Dewin] But is this possible after everything that  happened?"    [Ruego] It is always possible.    [Dewin] After all the massacres between the Hutus and  Tutsis?    [Ruego] Yes, even after the massacres we are ready to apply  the greater principles, such as national unity, and a government  on a broad basis, etc. But, of course there will be, I think,  some changes.    [Dewin] The question remains of who was behind the attack on  the presidents? Was the RPF involved in that?    [Ruego] Not at all. We applied to the letter everything we  were asked to do.    [Dewin] Nevertheless, it will be very difficult.    [Ruego] As a matter of fact, we do not have the intention to  talk to these commanders of massacres. It is not to them that  we will talk, but to the political parties with whom we had  already started negotiating.</p>

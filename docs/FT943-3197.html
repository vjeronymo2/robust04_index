			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / Technology: Treating pills like plastic German chemicals group BASF is using its plastics manufacturing technologies to improve the way its pharmaceuticals subsidiary makes medicines. The company says the change saves time, materials and floor space to the tune of more than Dollars 200m (Pounds 129m) a year, the equivalent to having developed a successful new drug. It should also improve the effectiveness of the drugs, says BASF, by better controlling the way the active ingredients leave the tablet and enter the bloodstream. Traditionally, pills are made in several stages, the active ingredients being made successively into granules, pellets and shaped tablets. BASF replaces that sequence with a single process in which the active ingredients are melted and extruded as a pliable strand, passed through rollers and chopped into tablets. The problem is that drugs are usually crystalline powders, lacking the elasticity of plastics. BASF's answer was to find a polymer that dissolves the powder when melted. As the polymer hardens the powder remains in what BASF calls a 'solid solution' and can be manipulated like a plastic. By reducing three processes to one, BASF's new pill-making method cuts the floor space required for manufacturing by three quarters. And by dissolving the powder into the pill material, the company reduces the need to deal with the potentially polluting solvents that are used in the traditional three-stage process. Finally, the medication can be improved because the polymer is designed to release the medicine slowly into the body. This controlled-release mechanism allows for higher doses to be administered and means patients need take tablets less often. BASF believes that the process will bring it contract manufacturing business. The first extruded medicines should reach the market within two or three years.</p>

			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Survey of Aerospace (16): Vista of freedom - France THE BALLADUR government has opened a new vista for France's aerospace industry by including Aerospatiale, the country's leading aircraft and missile maker, and Snecma, the aero-engine manufacturer, as well as Thomson, the electronics group, in its list of state companies to be sold off. Pressing though the government's need is for cash, the aerospace industry is most unlikely to field the first candidates for privatisation. The losses of Aerospatiale and Snecma deepened last year, while Thomson's group profits were sharply down. But the privatisation legislation carries no time limit, and once it is passed, the government says, the companies concerned will have more freedom to forge new industrial partnerships even before they reach the stock market. There is, of course, no question of these aerospace companies swimming right out of the orbit of the French state, which will retain an effective form of control through the defence budget and 'launch aid' for civil aircraft. The government has not specified in which companies it will take 'a golden share' allowing it to block takeover bids, but it is more than likely that this mechanism will be used in the aerospace/defence sectors. Faced in 1992 with its first contraction of business in 30 years, aerospace companies have already been trying to strike new alliances both inside and outside France as a way of stemming money and job losses. Aerospatiale's joint Eurocopter company venture with Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa) got off to a bad start last year, with sales falling 12 per cent and 500 employees being laid off. But it has been talking about rationalisation in missile-making to both Matra and Thomson, though the latter has decided to link forces with Shorts, the Canadian-owned Belfast firm, in making very short range ground to air missiles. The previous Socialist government has brought Dassault, France's military and business jet maker, into closer partnership, particularly in R&amp;D, with Aerospatiale. But the two companies' product range remains very different. For the long term, Dassault has started talking to British Aerospace about a joint successor aircraft to the Rafale and the European Fighter Aircraft which the two companies are building separately. In parallel, Snecma, which has made the Rafale engine by itself, is discussing co-operation with Rolls-Royce, a diversification from the French company's long-time partnership with General Electric of the US on civil engines. All this strategic manoeuvring is taking place in a business trough which Mr Henri Martre, former head of Aerospatiale and current president of Gifas, the French aerospace association, does not believe will end before 1995. Gifas reported that total turnover last year fell by 1.5 per cent to FFr101.4bn, while employment in the industry dropped again - despite substantial short-time working - to 111,600. The 1.8 per cent decline in civil sales was sharper and less expected than the smaller 1.2 per cent drop in military sales, which shows signs of bottoming out. The general problems of the airline industry, and the particular plight of Air France which lost some FFr3.2bn last year, were the root cause. Aerospatiale and its three Airbus partners kept their second place (31 per cent) in the world market for airliners of more than 100 seats. But the pleasure of seeing Airbus orders rise from 101 in 1991 to 136 in 1992 was alloyed by the fact that last year also saw previous orders for 95 Airbus cancelled. The Franco-Italian ATR consortium making regional haul aircraft also had a disappointing year, while Dassault's civil business is essentially marking time until its Falcon 2000 range comes on stream. France's aerospace industry knows it can expect little joy from the French defence ministry, whose equipment budget has declined by 8 per cent over the past two years and is likely to bear the brunt of further austerity cuts by the Balladur government. But military exports bounced back last year with a 4 per cent rise, while orders increased by 21 per cent, compensating for the 30 per cent decline in 1991. This was mainly thanks to a large order from Taiwan for 60 Mirages 2000-5s and some 1,500 missiles. A number of avionics and electronics firms will feel the benefit of this order, but most will go to Dassault and Matra, makers of the Mirages and most of the missiles concerned.</p>

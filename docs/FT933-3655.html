			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / Further sell-off protests expected TRANSPORT ministers yesterday sought to head off a fresh row about British Rail privatisation by emphasising that the deep cuts in services planned in BR's winter timetable were entirely separate from the privatisation plans. Labour has called for a national protest campaign at the reduced services revealed in the new timetable. Both Labour and the Liberal Democrats said the cuts came as part of the approach to privatisation. In spite of ministerial assurances, the reductions in weekend and off-peak services will add to the difficulties the government faces next month when parliament resumes discussion of the legislation to allow the private sector to bid to run rail services. Some of the leading Tory rebels are from constituencies in BR's Network SouthEast area, seen by passenger organisations as one of the areas particularly badly affected by the changes. Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, insisted that the changes were part of BR's normal management processes. 'This has got absolutely nothing to do with privatisation,' he told BBC radio. Mr MacGregor said that the service reductions arose because BR had carried fewer passengers in the recession, leading to a fall in its revenue. Mr Brian Wilson, Labour's transport spokesman, accused Mr MacGregor of 'monstrous cynicism' in cutting government funding for BR and predicted that the issue would intensify the campaign against privatisation. Mr Nick Harvey, Liberal Democrat transport spokesman, said: 'This confirms all our worst fears - that to try to make the franchises more attractive to private bidders, the whole public-service commitment is being slimmed down. The regional railways have been warning for some time that the level of funding the government was proposing for next year was going to mean massive cuts.' Mr Kenneth Carlisle, a former transport minister, is to lead a cross-party delegation of MPs to meet Mr Roger Freeman, the transport minister, next month to discuss rail services. He is the MP for Lincoln, one of the areas worst hit by the cuts. Tory MPs who rebelled when the privatisation legislation was debated in the Commons earlier this year have already said that plans for substantial fare increases would stiffen their determination to demand further concessions from the government.</p>

			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / Arts: Pinter reinterpreted - Alastair Macaulay visits a festival in Dublin devoted to the playwright's work Pinter Festival: the words are proclaimed on banners around Dublin. For three weeks this May, Dublin's Gate Theatre is presenting a festival of Harold Pinter's plays. Each week, a pair of his plays (one long in the evening, one short in the afternoon) is being given, in new productions; the playwright will direct one of them himself; several distinguished actors (including Ian Holm, Penelope Wilton, Michael Pennington) are involved. But why Dublin? Pinter's plays are not well known there, and have not been performed in recent years. The idea came from the Gate Theatre's director, Michael Colgan, and probably developed as a sequel to the theatre's recent Beckett festival. Pinter is the modern playwright who has learnt most from Beckett. (Surely even the famous Pinter pause derives from Beckett.) Pinter spent time in Ireland as an actor in the 1950s, working with the actor-manager Anew McMaster, about whom he has written a memoir, Mac. I believe that Pinter also picked up on the speech-patterns and poetic refractions of Irish modernism: Yeats, Joyce, and, above all, Beckett. Hence the alternations of lyricism and irony, the ambiguous meditations on time past, the sudden non-sequiturs and waits and hesitations, the richly suggestive use of ordinary parlance. John Gielgud once told Pinter that he had thought that playing No Man's Land would be like playing Chekhov, 'where you must ignore the audience', but that in fact he had discovered it needed a consciousness of the audience, a manipulation of them, as in Congreve or Wilde - yes, two other Dubliners. Colgan has chosen and paced the festival's six plays well, so that each week's pair shows contrasting facets of Pinter. The first week presented The Dumb Waiter (1959, 50 minutes) and Betrayal (1978, 95 minutes, including interval). The Dumb Waiter occurs in one of Pinter's most airless rooms, and is just for two hired killers. Betrayal is about a triangle of relationships between Robert, his best friend Jerry, and Robert's wife Emma; in ten scenes, over nine years, set in both London and Venice, it retrospectively surveys the love affair between Emma and Jerry. The Dumb Waiter was directed by Joe O'Byrne, Betrayal by Kevin Billington. Both realised the strong vein of humour in Pinter's writing, and the Dublin audience responded with ready laughter. Because some of his playwright contemporaries have been more overtly concerned with satirising various forms of Englishness, it is easy not to notice, when watching his plays in England, that Pinter is often satirising Englishness too. Seen abroad, his characters reveal their nationality more plainly, and amusingly. Even the pauses that occur between Robert and Jerry in Betrayal became funny in Dublin, because they expressed the emotional constipation of these upper-middle-class Londoners - their fatuous politeness, their stuffed-shirted inability to refer to a spade as a spade. Jerry (Stephen Brennan) in particular became more hilariously slow-witted; and, when Robert at one point remarked 'Didn't she?', Brennan delivered a tiny but superb triple-take, gradually and befuddledly adjusting to all the possible implications. English stupidity was also excellently evident in David Herlihy's account of Gus in The Dumb Waiter, bringing out the dark pun in the title: dumbo Gus is waiting for he knows not what - not until it is too late. Brief though it be, The Dumb Waiter defies categorisation. (A sign of Pinter's early mastery.) Here it is a black comedy about two killers who are pawns in someone else's game, here an existential waiting-for-Godot tragedy about the cruel pointlessness of existence (Gus: 'Who is it upstairs?'; Ben: 'What's one thing to do with another?'). Now a surreal, Ionesco-like, sketch in which nonsensical events become both disturbing and absurd; now a kind of thriller in which events add up in a pattern virtually too grim to contemplate. Ian McElhinny - who in The Dumb Waiter was the dour and uninquisitive Ben - also, in Betrayal played Robert: an astonishing double-act. He makes Robert snide and urbane, as oblique about his emotional dealings as some character in le Carre. His very tightness of manner actually makes him much more touching in the one scene when he speaks with Emma of her infidelity with his best friend. Emma was Jeananne Crowley, a tad too muted, but lightening in looks and bearing to very telling effect as the play moves back in time. The Pinter Festival continues at the Gate Theatre, Dublin, until May 21</p>

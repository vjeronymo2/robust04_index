App. 453) and other requirements applicable to programs funded under the specific section or title of the Act under which the participant is enrolling (section 604).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Recipients shall ensure that individuals are enrolled within 45 days of the date of eligibility determination or a new eligibility determination (including new application, if necessary) shall be made, except that eligible summer program applicants under title II-B may be enrolled within 45 days into a summer youth enrollee pool, and no subsequent eligibility determination need be made prior to participation during the period of that summer program. In addition, the 45-day enrollment requirement shall not apply for individuals who have a valid certificate of continuing eligibility under the title III program, as described in &sect;631.3 and &sect;631.53 of this chapter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Programs operated under titles I, II, and III of the Act are not subject to the provisions of 29 CFR part 97, ``Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Cooperative Agreements to State and Local Governments,'' except as otherwise explicitly provided in this chapter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) If a recipient or SDA imposes a requirement that is in addition to the provisions of the Act and these regulations relating to the administration and operation of programs funded by the Act, the recipient or SDA shall identify the requirement as a State- or SDA-imposed requirement (section 124).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;627.240  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> On-the-job training.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> General_(1) On-the-job training <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (OJT) means training by an employer in the private or public sector given to a participant who, after objective assessment, and in accordance with the ISS, has been referred to and hired by the employer following the development of an agreement with the employer to provide occupational training in exchange for reimbursement of the employer's extraordinary costs. On-the-job training occurs while the participant is engaged in productive work which provides knowledge and skills essential to the full and adequate performance of the job.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) This does not preclude a participant who has been trained by one employer from ultimately being placed in a comparable training-related position with another employer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) On-the-job training may be sequenced with or accompanied by other types of training such as classroom training or literacy training.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Duration of OJT. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _(1) OJT authorized for a participant shall be limited to a period not in excess of that required for the participant to acquire the skills needed for the OJT position. Except as described in paragraph (b) (3) of this section, the period of reimbursement to the employer under an OJT agreement shall not exceed 6 months of training.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The 6-month duration of OJT may be expressed as a number of hours, days, or weeks the participant is expected to work in a 6-month period if the participant works full-time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) In the event that a participant's regular employment is less than full-time and less than 500 hours of OJT has occurred by the end of 6 months, that participant may remain in OJT until 499 hours OJT hours have occurred.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4)(i) Recipients shall develop policies and procedures for determining the average training duration for occupations including to reflect an individual participant's need for additional training time, or reduction in training time to reflect the individual participant's partial acquisition of needed skills. (In no case should an individual who is fully skilled in an occupation be placed in OJT in that occupation.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) In determining the average training time, consideration should be given to recognized reference materials, such as the ``Dictionary of Occupational Titles'' (DOT) and employer training plans. Such materials need not be limited to the DOT, however.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) On-the-job training is encouraged, but not required, in all occupations with significant training content, particularly in higher-skill occupations appropriate to the participant's needs. Training plans may be developed that recognize the full duration of the OJT period necessary for the full and adequate performance of the job, but the period of reimbursement may not exceed the duration in paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) When the OJT period in a given occupation for a participant for whom the ISS identifies OJT as appropriate varies from the average for that occupation, the basis for the variation shall be recorded in the ISS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

He discussed with them a number of national  issues and concerns related to democratic practices, and  stressed the principle of political pluralism and respect for  others' opinions.    During this meeting, the brother chairman spoke about our  country's current political crisis and the efforts being made to  find national solutions for the crisis to maintain the  homeland's unity and the people's cohesion. He hoped that this  meeting will be a new start for responsible and serious  political action by members of the General People's Congress  [GPC] and other national political forces to close ranks and  confront the forces that tirelessly try to undermine the  people's gains and the homeland's unity. He said that  responsible political action requires everyone to work amid the  masses, adopt their concerns, contribute toward tackling their  issues, and embody their aspirations for the building of the  modern Yemeni state, the state of law and order. He said that  everyone should work to serve the country's well-being and  progress, rather than to be involved in one-upmanship and cheap  gains at the expense of values, principles, and national  objectives and constants.    The brother chairman noted the importance of intensifying  political activity and democratic practices and confronting the  hostile propaganda which is aimed at breaking the social  cohesion and undermining the homeland's unity. He said that  unity is a great achievement for the sake of which our people  have offered the dearest sacrifices. He said: We should move  faster to bolster the march that we have started since the  establishment of the GPC. This march is full of major  achievements on all development and national levels, culminating  in the great unity.    Addressing attendees, the brother chairman said: We should  counter the biased propaganda with objective facts and tangible  achievements. You should discuss frankly and objectively all  aspects of corruption and counter laxity, carelessness, and all  backward practices that harm the homeland's march and progress.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 25 KYODO -- Trade Minister Eijiro Hata  expressed the hope Saturday [25 June] that the political vacuum  following the resignation of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata's  Cabinet will not affect ongoing Japan-U.S. negotiations for a  new framework for bilateral trade.    Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, who came to power only two  months ago, decided to resign with his cabinet en masse Saturday  only a few hours before the House of Representatives was to vote  on a no- confidence motion submitted by the opposition Liberal  Democratic Party.    The minister of international trade and industry told  reporters after the extraordinary cabinet meeting to decide on  the resignation that a psychological impact on the Japan-U.S.  trade talks is unavoidable.    He expressed hope that a new cabinet will be formed as soon  as possible to tackle the issue, adding that a broad policy  accord has already been reached and the basic approach toward  the conclusion of the talks will not change.    He said a package of economic deregulation measures to be  completed by the government toward the end of the month will be  carried out as scheduled.</p>

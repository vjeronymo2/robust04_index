			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / BICC drops 56% to Pounds 81m pre-tax: Group hit by property development write-downs and Transmanche Link provisions BICC, the UK-based cables and construction group, suffered a 56 per cent fall in pre-tax profit to Pounds 81m last year after property development write-downs and provisions for losses on the Channel tunnel contract. Exceptional charges amounted to Pounds 42m, of which Pounds 30m was attributed to property development and Pounds 12m to BICC's share of provisional losses incurred last year by Transmanche Link, a consortium of British and French companies building the tunnel. BICC's operating profit fell by 31 per cent to Pounds 146m from Pounds 212m on turnover of Pounds 3.79bn, down from Pounds 3.89bn. Mr Robin Biggam, chairman, said the profit decline included Pounds 17m of rationalisation costs. This covered about 2,500 job losses in manufacturing worldwide and several hundred more in Balfour Beatty, the group's construction arm. The North American cables business slid to Pounds 3m losses, from a Pounds 26m profit. Mr Biggam described this as 'the biggest single disappointment'. BICC Cables remained the largest profit contributor with Pounds 91m, down from Pounds 110m. It experienced weak second-half demand for telecoms cabling from BT in the UK, and Telefonica in Spain. As it had recently increased its stake in Grupo Espanol General Cable (GEGC) to 55 per cent and acquired a German company, continental sales would account for half the divisional total this year. Balfour Beatty improved its profit to Pounds 38m from Pounds 35m on turnover of Pounds 1.9bn, up from Pounds 1.78bn as civil and power engineering contracts, including overseas work, offset the downturn in UK building. Balfour was hit by losses in a contract car and van hire business, which is to be sold. In Australasia, profit fell to Pounds 26m from Pounds 33m. Factory rationalisation had been completed, electrical wholesaling recovered to break even and a decision had been made to get out of construction. Earnings per share fell to 10.7p from 40.2p. Mr Biggam said one highlight was the generation of Pounds 40m cash by the core operations, before a Pounds 57m outflow to fund property developments. Off-balance sheet debt had been reduced from Pounds 255m to less than Pounds 200m. On the balance sheet, net borrowings of Pounds 35m replaced Pounds 2m cash. The group has issued Pounds 177m of convertible capital bonds and will this year take on Pounds 100m of GEGC's debt, leaving a total of about Pounds 150m off balance sheet. An extraordinary charge of Pounds 26m was made for losses on businesses being sold. To maintain the total dividend at 19.25p, Pounds 51m was taken from reserves. Net assets, however, benefited from a revaluation of sites and rose to Pounds 685m from Pounds 665m, counting the capital bond as equity. Lex, Page 18</p>

Palomares; place and date  not given: "Felipe Gonzalez Asserts That Whoever Commits Crime  of Corruption `Ends Up Paying'"]    [Text] Madrid -- Felipe Gonzalez is convinced that  "whoever commits a crime within what is termed corruption ends  up paying." The head of government made this general assertion,  at a time when evidence of the improper use of secret funds is  proliferating, in an interview with EFE agency President Alfonso  S. Palomares. Gonzalez asserted, "contrary to the doomsayers,"  that "the crisis is beginning to be surmounted," and expressed  his confidence that the coming PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers  Party] congress will serve to make the party "a more transparent  organization in its functioning and in its funding."    The Socialist leader regards as unfounded the impression  that  some cases of corruption go unpunished in Spain. According to  him, what happens is that judicial investigation is sometimes  slow and causes some frustration because there is no immediate  response. "But there is not the slightest doubt that, in general  terms and respecting what is the rule-of-law state, whoever  commits a crime within what is termed corruption ends up  paying," he asserted.    Gonzalez tried to convey hope and optimism about the future,  and to this end argued: "It can in no way be believed that we  are in a stage of decline, even though we are in a crisis  situation."    In his opinion, the fact that 5,000 net jobs were lost in  February, as against the 48,000 lost in February 1992, shows  "the trend is changing." This will be seen in foreign trade,  "and, appreciably, in tourism and the construction industry."    "We are beginning to recover a much more positive path from  the economic viewpoint. This will be slow, and the structural  problems must continue to be combated. And I also say, contrary  to the doomsayers," Gonzalez added, "that the crisis is  beginning to be surmounted."    The prime minister announced that he will give the struggle  against unemployment top priority, at the same time as  continuing the effort to contain the deficit. According to the  PSOE secretary general, the welfare state needs to "readjust."  "It is necessary to curb any kind of abuse, and try to order  the welfare state in such a way that it will survive," he stated.    Gonzalez explained that the basic intention of the labor  reform prepared by the government and now submitted for debate  in parliament is to facilitate enterprises' adjustment to the  changes, an adjustment in which employers and trade unions  should have more prominent role and the government a less  prominent one.  <H5>  Investment Confidence </H5>   From his viewpoint, the suspension of payments by the  Santana  plant in Linares (Jaen) is not a sign of foreign investment's  loss of confidence in Spain but a result of the crisis. "If  there were some element of loss of confidence, we would have to  do whatever is possible to regain confidence," he added.    Nine months after the parliamentary elections, the prime  minister believes that 9 million citizens gave him their support  to promote the culture of pacts between the parliamentary  forces. The "change on change" also consists, he added, of some  aspects of economic policy and of imparting a new impetus in the  autonomy and institutional spheres. "And we will continue along  this path," he stated.    Following several months of agreements between the  government and Convergence and Union, he stated that they have  both seriously discussed such important issues as the course in  the struggle against the deficit and tax incentives for  investment. "There has been no kind of pressure or that  impression which some people sometimes wish to give of  horse-trading, which is an extremely unpleasant thing because it  is unfair."    And he took the opportunity to rebuke the People's Party for  its criticisms of that cooperation. "Our conduct has been  serious and much more responsible than that of those who are  shouting against it, and who would probably be doing the same  thing if they were in the position in which we find ourselves."    "I believe," the prime minister added, "that it is very  important for our country that the moderate nationalists in  Catalonia should become involved with the state's government,  with Spain's governability. It seems to me that this is  important." This contribution benefits the Catalan nationalists  themselves in the sense that "they know very well that if Spain  as a whole fares well, if the Spanish economy as a whole fares  well, Catalonia fares well within that whole."  <H5>  Impetus to Autonomy </H5>   Gonzalez stated that, following the extension of the  so-called slow track autonomous communities' powers, the  government will now make "an effort to complete the so-called  historical communities' autonomy statutes. We are trying to  complete (the autonomy framework), but to complete it in terms  which are somewhat relative from the historical viewpoint. This  does not mean," he warned, "that the area of friction between a  power which is being decentralized and a power which is being  assumed on the basis of decentralization will disappear for  ever."    In order to explain that warning, he pointed out that "even  as centralist a state as France has a constant process of  discussion on the elements of administrative and political  decentralization."    With respect to the negotiations with the People's Party to  select the holders of vacant institutional posts, the prime  minister stated that if the People's Party insists on making  some agreements conditional on others, the government "will try  to seek a solution." After acknowledging that the People's  Party -- if not exactly its chairman, Jose Maria Aznar -- is an  electoral alternative, he added that "whether it could be  defined as an alternative in terms of its program is another,  and much more debatable, matter. Every month and a half or two  months, they say that they are presenting a new economic  program...."    Gonzalez trusts that Spain's dispute with Norway within the  framework of the enlargement of the European Union over the  fishing quota for Spain in that country's waters "will be  resolved over the next few days."    With respect to the presence of Spanish troops in Bosnia, he  explained possible future contributions in this way: "We are  one of the few countries which have a presence in the area, and  we are making an enormous humanitarian aid effort, at the limit  of our means. If it were a matter of rounding off this effort  with another company, it would be possible; if it were a matter  of doubling our effort, this honestly would not be possible for  us, and therefore we have said so."  <H5>  "I Have Not Asked and Do Not Ask for a Free Hand" </H5>   "I have never used this expression, because I do not like  it.  The strength which I may have had within the party has depended  basically on my availability. Hence I have not asked and do not  ask for a free hand." With this statement, Felipe Gonzalez  tried to clarify in the interview with the EFE agency what  exactly his stance is on the coming PSOE federal congress, which  will begin next Friday [18 March].    "What I have always asked of my comrades and will continue  to  ask," Gonzalez said, "is not to ask me to work against my  conscience or my personal convictions. I am in agreement with  the resolutions of the majority of my comrades, I work well; if  I disagreed and felt that I was in a minority, I could not  shoulder the majority's responsibilities."    The Socialist leader advocates as a general rule that voting  be individual and public, delegate by delegate, "in all  proceedings of the congress and in the life of the party in  general. And it should be secret for the election of officials."    The candidate for reelection as secretary general wants the  PSOE Federal Executive Committee to have from this congress  onward a standing committee which will meet more frequently than  the team as a whole. He also wants "part of that leadership to  deal with internal matters and for the main part of the  leadership to deal with conveying to society what the party's  tasks must be."  <H5>  Bar for Women </H5>   Gonzalez agreed with the "aspiration" of a "democracy of  parity," in which men and women will be represented equally.  "How we move from this situation to achieving that aspiration  is another matter," he added: "Some people sometimes become  annoyed because I say that the problem which we still have is  that we are jumping one and a half meters, and if we set the bar  at 2.2 meters, somebody will be tempted to pass under the bar  and not try to jump. What we must do is to be raising the bar  in order to achieve the aim of a `democracy of parity,' which  seems to me one of the major elements of change for the society  of the future in Spain."    From his viewpoint, the main conclusions of the congress  should be "the intention to fight unemployment as an essential  factor in surmounting the economic crisis, and to make the party  a transparent organization from every viewpoint in its  functioning and funding, so that the intention to open itself to  society and be in constant contact with it is apparent."</p>
